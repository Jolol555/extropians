<i>&gt;Message #8019</i><br>
<i>&gt;Date: Tue, 8 Apr 1997 12:57:50 -0400 (EDT)</i><br>
<i>&gt;From: Ben Best &lt;benbest@benbest.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subject: Immortality</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    I am an ardent life extensionist and atheist, but if someone asked</i><br>
<i>&gt;me if I wanted to be "Immortal", I think I would say "No". </i><br>
<p>
Not very ardent, how about some dynamic optimism?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is sometimes </i><br>
<i>&gt;hard to remember that FOREVER includes 10exp10exp1000 years from now. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Do I want to be alive in 10exp10exp1000 years? </i><br>
<p>
I do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Seriously, I is hard to be serious about colossal time-frames. The very</i><br>
<i>&gt;nature of matter will be altered. Even if I survive</i><br>
<i>&gt;1,000 years -- my current ardent hope -- I am likely to be transformed </i><br>
<i>&gt;beyond recognition from my present self (although hopefully, this will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be "survival").</i><br>
<p>
Will you recognize your self?<br>
Personally I do not think even that matters much as long as I'm alive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    I think it is taxing the credibility of scientific assessment of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the nature of transformation of matter (and the increasing probability of</i><br>
<i>&gt;destruction with the increasing passage of time, even if the probability </i><br>
<i>&gt;is diminishing --</i><br>
<p>
If the probability is diminishing it is diminishing.<br>
You only die if you do a thing kills you, probable or not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think that anyone who is passionately concerned about</i><br>
<i>&gt;survival in 10exp10exp1000 years is downright goofy.</i><br>
<p>
I want to live and I'm goofy?<br>
What would I be if I wanted to die?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   The most urgent problem is to survive the next 1,000 years. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;greatest step in this direction will be the elimination of aging and</i><br>
<i>&gt;the creation of true suspended animation. </i><br>
<p>
...the greatest step, are you sure?<br>
First age is not our enemy, disfunction is.<br>
I would rather be a millenia of age with full capability<br>
than a challenged person with 18 years of age.<br>
Second I would rather be doing things other than being really still, <br>
at least for a long time.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The achievement of these</i><br>
<i>&gt;goals are of passionately critical importance. A focus of "Immortality",</i><br>
<i>&gt;by contrast, represents air-headed distraction from practical issues</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- as if living 200 years is as much a fantasy as living "forever".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I think there is an infinite difference between them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   It is also of no small practical importance that the people who could</i><br>
<i>&gt;do the most to destroy the chance of scientific life-extension &amp; suspended</i><br>
<i>&gt;animation -- ie, religionists -- are VASTLY more infuriated about claims</i><br>
<i>&gt;that science can achieve immortality than that science can extend life.</i><br>
<p>
Let us stop calling it immortality.<br>
They are jealous of us using the meme.<br>
Call it indefinite longevity,<br>
or better yet help me think of an extremely technical term <br>
in an obscure language.<br>
If they do not know what we are talking about <br>
they may not argue as much about it.<br>
Either that <br>
or we should learn to express our concerns with their words <br>
so they see we want the same thing they do,<br>
though we do not want to make God provide it for us.<br>
I think Gods job is hard enough.<br>
Why make him do the work?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We should stick to the medical model and leave the concern with religion</i><br>
<i>&gt;&amp; death to the airheads </i><br>
<p>
I would rather not need learn or concern my self with death.<br>
Religion is metaphysics and law.<br>
Metaphysics is a necessity of physics.<br>
Law is programing I need to carry out goals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;( avoid waving red flags in front of bulls).</i><br>
<p>
Wave a flag remotely as a distraction <br>
and the rest of the arena is yours.<br>
