But how then would you know if you were an extropian if you knew nothing<br>
of extropians? <br>
<p>
Information for information's sake is a good thing. Any bit of data,<br>
however small, provides a foundation for further learning. If you had<br>
never had certain resources at your disposal, your learning on certain<br>
subjects would have been severely curtailed. How then can excess<br>
information be a bad thing? Who says you have to care about all of it?<br>
Indeed, without carrying with you what seemed at one point in your life<br>
to be a mundane fact, you might have missed out on an important, perhaps<br>
entirely original connection between navel oranges and the JFK<br>
assasination. Furthermore, without excess data, you may never have<br>
discovered the data set that interests you the most. Finally, if you had<br>
a repository of the accumulated knowledge of mankind throughout history<br>
what would you be doing with your life right now? I imagine that I<br>
probably would not be in law school. I would care little for the<br>
bothersome specifics of human governance and concentrate more fully on<br>
the "big picture." Indeed, if I could spout the law off the top of my<br>
head (and make a cogent argument therefrom) I would be the finest<br>
attorney Court TV had ever seen. <br>
<p>
So then, I see your point about the trial and error of learning which<br>
must not be dismissed lightly. However so much of our time in school is<br>
devoted to understanding what has already been discovered or decided. If<br>
the best and brightest already knew the stuff, how much faster would new<br>
discoveries and decisions be made? <br>
<p>
"Eureka! I have found it!"<br>
<p>
"Because you did, I did! Eureka! Look what else I've found!"<br>
<p>
Keep it real, <br>
<p>
