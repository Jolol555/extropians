<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This has been posted to the technocracy list, as a reply to my request</i><br>
<i>&gt; regarding the goals of technocracy.  Could somebody please comment on</i><br>
<i>&gt; these guys' approach validity? I know that the loss of jobs due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; automation problem is real, probably forcing us to do some (discriminate!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; wealth redistribution over long. However, I somehow fail to see how below</i><br>
<i>&gt; approach should solve any problems at all...</i><br>
<i>&gt; |karpal|</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I get worried when someone tells me of a magic scheme to solve all of <br>
our problems, that involves the citizenry rising up, and imposing it<br>
on everyone.<br>
<p>
It sounds to me like someone took an ecology course, and was struck<br>
by how ecosystems have energy economies. They then proceeded to <br>
rename a number of existing economic structures, and refer to them<br>
in CAPITAL LETTERS.<br>
To some approximation, money is already a shorthand in the economy<br>
for energy transfers (to the point that you can model it that way),<br>
and can be tracked the way that an energy budget is used in <br>
ecology. It gives a nice viewpoint of looking at it, and maybe <br>
some insight. <br>
Unfortunately this bunch seems to have missed that nature is the <br>
ultimate market economy (if income goes below expenses for an extended<br>
period of time, the animal or plant goes out of business (dies and or goes<br>
extinct)).<br>
It sounds like they think this form of accounting will automatically make<br>
some change in the system. However, nature is way ahead of them. Natural<br>
systems accomodate parasitism (read: taxation), overgrazing (deficit spending),<br>
symbiosis (sweetheart regulatory deals) etc. <br>
The problem is not the accounting system, but rather the system itself,<br>
and they seem kinda vague about how they will change it, and how they <br>
will mandate those changes.<br>
<p>
Specifics follow.<br>

<i>&gt; From: Jacqueline Q. Scott &lt;jqs@pond.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; To: Eugene.Leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: TECHNOCRACY</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hello Karpal -- or Eugene Leitl -- or whoever.  Do you know zero about</i><br>
<i>&gt; Technocracy??? </i><br>
<p>
Why is it that the purveyors of "magic bullet" solutions seem to think <br>
everyone should already know them? This is a tip off that we're dealing <br>
with faith rather than reason.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Technocracy would be about is THE ANSWER to North America's [and</i><br>
<i>&gt; eventually our planet's] financial fiscal crises -- which have grown</i><br>
<i>&gt; worse with fifty years on Red Ink-o-nomics of WW II.</i><br>
<p>
The capital letters seem to be either out of a marketing department, or a <br>
Zippy the Pinhead quote generator. Neither bode well for the rest of <br>
the piece.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Technocracy's goal is to aid in the GREAT SWITCHOVER from fiscal</i><br>
<i>&gt; accounting of GNP to energy accounting system of ECO*nomics --</i><br>
<i>&gt; calculating everything in actual quantity produced by the amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy [KWTS, ergs, BTU's instead of IOU's] on a total and a per capita</i><br>
<i>&gt; so that everyone in a geographic area would be supplied plenty of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth's natural resources as well as those manufactured.</i><br>
<p>
No specifics, but the implication of some sort of system to mandate that <br>
everyone got what someone else deemed was plenty.<br>
The "geographic area" sounds suspiciously like a centrally planned <br>
economy for various regions. The past few decades have shown that to<br>
be pretty much bankrupt (USSR, N. Korea, etc.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The BIG DIFFERENCE in today's manufacture, as well as agriculture, from</i><br>
<i>&gt; a century ago is the use of sophisticated technology instead of muscle</i><br>
<i>&gt; power -- especially with the 20th century's advent of KWTS -- and yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; we're still trying to price people when they perform only 2% of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; labor of today's world of push buttons and automation.</i><br>
<p>
Well, I can't argue too much with that. But that's partly because the <br>
last sentence is confusingly worded.<br>
I keep wondering about the reference to KWTS (I assume they mean<br>
kilowatts) almost as if it were a religious invocation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To sum it up -- The Summit of Eight are meeting in Denver to try a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fiscal fix when our real problem is perpetuating the PRICE/PROFIT SYSTEM</i><br>
<i>&gt; which perpetuates pollution and poverty -- while Wall Street and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Washington are going crazy on IOU's, the rest of are trying to survive</i><br>
<i>&gt; alive on the WAGE GUAGE which actually rations food/ housing/ medical</i><br>
<i>&gt; care / education instead of equitably calculating HOW MUCH STUFF VS HOW</i><br>
<i>&gt; MUCH POPULATION.</i><br>
<p>
Again this begs the question of who is going to do the calculating of <br>
who gets what.<br>
It does use the time honored method of raising a specter that can then<br>
be villified (The Summit of Eight), and hopefully keep you from noticing<br>
that what they consider the real enemy is the "PRICE/PROFIT SYSTEM", <br>
i.e. free market economics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I know I'm putting this in simple terms, but Technocracy's goal is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; help implement this DESIGN which was developed by 300 top researchers</i><br>
<i>&gt; who took INVENTORY of North America's resources and minerals to see if</i><br>
<i>&gt; we could support our INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION which tends to gobble up</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources much faster than the 19th century hand-tool pace.</i><br>
<p>
Not only an appeal to credentials, but anonymous ones at that.<br>
Sorry, but I stopped buying pigs in pokes some time ago.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; THE PROBLEM IS -- in Six Decades of publications, lectures and meetings,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not many Americans seem to understand what Technocracy is all about.</i><br>
<p>
Not many Americans understand what Scientology is about either, despite<br>
several decades of moderately successful marketing.<br>
And note how Technocracy is capitalized so it refers to something <br>
completely different than the usual meaning of technocracy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just last week President Clinton in San Diego was talking about equality</i><br>
<i>&gt; of races -- whereas the DESIGN of a Technate of The Americas would</i><br>
<i>&gt; assure more equality than any money system ever has or could -- for</i><br>
<i>&gt; everyone would be assured their share [by choice not price] of whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; our GNP would be in consumables and housing would no longer be by</i><br>
<i>&gt; mortgage -- so everyone would enjoy the best quality and most</i><br>
<i>&gt; sustainable.</i><br>
<p>
This is what in science is called the too many miracles problem.<br>
Just implement our magic system (which we don't rigidly define), and <br>
all the problems will go away.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You refer to Hayek and I've, for many years, received THE FREEMAN</i><br>
<i>&gt; economics journal [which is not about economics but financial] and Hayek</i><br>
<i>&gt; is discussing ways to make the dollarsign system work -- when the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact is that KWTS changed forever the way people and machines WORK --</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet we're still attempting to price everything as if we're all still on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the farms and making stuff by hand -- which we aren't.</i><br>
<p>
I certainly see the quantitative changes it wrought, and in some cases <br>
even qualitative changes, but I don't immediately see how they negate<br>
the utility of a market economy. Again, no reasoning behind it is given.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Did you just recently come into the Technocrat/Technocracy loop?  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In simple terms, Technocracy proposes MEASUREMENT by quantity instead of</i><br>
<i>&gt; PRICE -- I just spoke with a man this morning about how many KWTS his</i><br>
<i>&gt; household consumes and he couldn't tell me except in dollarsigns.  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; awfully hard to get folks to think in terms of quantity instead of</i><br>
<i>&gt; price.</i><br>
<p>
You could measure it in Quatloos, or whatever unit you want, but there<br>
will still be a mapping from one measurement system to another. The<br>
basic math doesn't change. <br>
It would take some work to account for all the input and outgo of a <br>
household in terms of energy used, but I'm not even sure it would have much <br>
real utility, outside of making decisions about environmental impact. <br>
Unlike a price system, it's cumbersome in its dealing with scarcity or<br>
overabundance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Entirely different from politics [which takes money and lots of it] the</i><br>
<p>
And what does this have to do with the price of butter in Beijing?<br>
Simple obfuscation to draw attention to dissatisfaction with an aspect<br>
of the current system, and away from questioning the one being discussed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; physical lines of production crossed in 1913 [Chart on Brief No. 28]</i><br>
<i>&gt; going upward while the number of hours to produce unit of product went</i><br>
<i>&gt; downward from 14 hours a day to what we promote now -- and had zero to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do with who was President or banking -- these are physical facts.</i><br>
<p>
Ah, so I am to understand that government and banking policy has zero to<br>
do with the outcomes of the economy?<br>
It's not a direct cause and effect relation, but each has some effect on the <br>
other. To say that it has none, is just a way of trying to sell that since<br>
the current system is irrelevant you won't lose anything by trying ours.<br>
I'll give them that the current system may in some ways be undesireable, but <br>
hardly irrelevant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are INFLECTION POINTS in pig iron or automobiles where things take</i><br>
<i>&gt; an S-curve -- CEO Andrew Grove of INTEL Corp. told Commonwealth Club</i><br>
<i>&gt; several years ago that when INTEL hit the Inflection Point he had to lay</i><br>
<i>&gt; off not the usual 10% but a third of their workers and close down a</i><br>
<i>&gt; third of their plant.  [and IBM was hoping Intel would take over some of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their closed factories...no way.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; His message to the Commonwealth Club and to AMERICA, was that AMEERICA</i><br>
<i>&gt; has now reached its inflection point.</i><br>
<p>
Another message that says the system is about to collapse or go thru a <br>
major reshuffling, with the implication that only our magic system will keep <br>
bad things from happening to you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'd like to see the Citizens rise up peacefully with a CITIZENS' BALLOT</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a new accounting system based on Technocracy's Energy Accounting</i><br>
<i>&gt; which has all been researched before we were born -- based on a DESIGN</i><br>
<i>&gt; which would prove ecologically sustainable -- for we all recognize that</i><br>
<i>&gt; our present M.O.N.E.Y. SYSTEM of Man-ipulating Of Nation's Economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yield as if there is not enough to go around, is not equitable and</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't consider some people as human beings deserving of even a roof</i><br>
<i>&gt; over their heads or appropriate food let alone education unless you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; afford $25,000 and cerdtainly health care becomes prohibitive for 40</i><br>
<i>&gt; millions.</i><br>
<p>
Attempt to lay on a guilt trip if you support a free market system.<br>
Also note the use of the acronym. Likely there is some defined <br>
definition of M.O.N.E.Y (tm) that is different from what is the<br>
usual meaning of money, and the economic system it circulates in.<br>
I'm reminded of the early 70s when one commercial jingle was:<br>
"We've changed our name to Exxon, but it's still the same old gas"<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; What do YOU see as a better way to IMPLEMENT the best of what has</i><br>
<i>&gt; already been designed for North Americans to live well, but not as</i><br>
<i>&gt; wastefully?</i><br>
<p>
Gads, the hubris. No allowance that there might be a better way than their<br>
magic formula, but only a possibility of more effectively implementing<br>
what they have already dictated (and not bothered to really define).<br>
Sounds like the usual true believer viewpoint.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Where do you fit into all this?  JQS</i><br>
<p>
An implication that if you aren't part of the solution, you're part of the <br>
problem. i.e. Why aren't you out there shouting our magic system from the <br>
rooftops, because any fool can see it's the best.<br>
<p>
<p>
Well, sounds like the usual dreck from those who would impose a bankrupt<br>
centrally planned economy for supposed environmental reasons. Their program<br>
could have some worthwhile aspects to it, but it's impossible to tell from <br>
this. It's all sales, and no real info.<br>
On the whole: No thanks.<br>
<p>
