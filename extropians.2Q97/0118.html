<p>
My Hitachi has been giving me problems.  I finally figured out that it was<br>
an inappropriate video card, rather than a wiggly monitor. In dealing with<br>
the problem, I'm considering other options, one of which is a different<br>
monitor -- the Trinitron along with the Matrox Millennium (if it upgrades to<br>
8mg).  The other option is to stick with the Hitachi and purchase either the<br>
4mg VRAM card of the #9.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Hitachi makes beautiful monitors if</i><br>
<i>&gt;you can afford them.</i><br>
<p>
My question then would be are you familiar with the 800, 801 and 802 series<br>
of Hitachi 21"?  (I haven't been successful at researching this on the Web.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Some people don't like the barely visible mask</i><br>
<i>&gt;seam line in the Trinitron, but it's otherwise a good deal.  All of</i><br>
<i>&gt;those monitors will handle the refresh rates shown.  All the cards</i><br>
<i>&gt;you mention are decent cards, but a year or two out of date.</i><br>
<p>
Any suggestions for newer cards?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, depending on your application, you may not want such high</i><br>
<i>&gt;resolutions, even at that size.  I run my 20" NEC at 1152x864 with</i><br>
<i>&gt;no problem, but higher than that would be hard to read for me. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Also</i><br>
<i>&gt;note that 1280x1024 is the wrong aspect ratio (has non-square pixels)</i><br>
<i>&gt;which might be a problem for art design.  1600x1200 is correct, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;is 1280x960, which some of those cards will do.</i><br>
<p>
I'm accustomed to using 1280x1024, and haven't had problems with service<br>
bureaus for print outs.  1600x1200 might be too small for me in that I have<br>
a stigmatism and get headaches easily.<br>
<p>
I appreciate your suggestions and comments, Lee.  Thanks.<br>
