Sounds like a hard problem, but most probably worthwhile. <br>
<p>
When people accuse me of wanting to play God I usually point out that it <br>
is by playing one truly learns. <br>
<p>
Here are some one-liners and other quotes:<br>
<p>
"...the only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand<br>
our best efforts to examine it." - Daniel C. Dennett<br>
<p>
It's time to stop worshipping gods and aim at becoming gods. -- Markoff<br>
Chaney<br>
<p>
We are alreadly like gods, now we better get good at it too. -- <br>
Misquoted from somewhere (Whole Earth Review?)<br>
<p>
"I see no difference between physical and spiritual.<br>
How about this:<br>
a physical mind,<br>
a physical body,<br>
a physical soul,<br>
a physical heaven,<br>
and a physical God.<br>
<p>
I notice that the definitions of those concepts are very mystical.<br>
I believe mysticism is tactic used to keep people stupid.<br>
Stupid people are too busy arguing about things <br>
to notice they are being killed.<br>
It is memetic warfare."<br>
Mike Cowar<br>
<p>
Two little longer but relevant quotes: <br>
<p>
Like the Romantics before them, genre SF writers have generally been on<br>
the side of Faust, convinced that the quest for knowledge was a sacred<br>
one, no matter how fondly a jealous God might prefer blind faith.<br>
Stableford, Brian and Peter Nichols. 1993. "Technology." Pp. 1202-1204 in<br>
The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, eds. John Clute and Peter Nichols.<br>

<p>
The second face had the classical beauty that could belong to a man as<br>
well as a woman. There was no particular expression of virility nor of<br>
femininity. Still it wasn't a blank face; it expressed youth -- eternal<br>
triumphant youth -- transcending everything else. The expression<br>
proclaimed pure simple existence, superior to any mystery, torment or<br>
nostalgias. It was a plenitude, not self-contained, but expressing<br>
limitlessness. In other words, it was a face of a god and very human at<br>
the same time. This head proclaimed, "God is human and human is God." <br>
William Markiewicz (from some issue of the Vagabond)<br>
<p>
<p>
And finally a fun exchange from the omega-point theory list: <br>
<p>
Cosma: Man trully *is* God<br>
Jim Davila: Heaven help us!<br>
