<i>        &gt;To the universe perception is nothing.</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
Perhaps not, according to many of the most popular interpretations of Quantum <br>
Mechanics nothing is anything until it is perceived.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Think about it, logic *is* cause and effect.  There is nothing that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;exists that has effect without cause.     </i><br>
          <br>
<p>
When I say that A causes B, I mean that if I place the events observable from   <br>
my frame of reference in a sequence ordered according to time, and I find  <br>
event A in the sequence, then I will always find event B at some later point  <br>
in the sequence, and that's all I mean. <br>
<p>
Some thing have no cause and so are random. Modern Physics has caused the <br>
idea of causality to be weakened and that has caused me to write this. If you <br>
like this post then I gladly accept the credit, but if you hate it, don't <br>
blame me, it's not my fault, it's the  results of my genes or my environment <br>
or my luck, and I can't control any of them.<br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;If I am sad, frightened, angry and jealous then I am feeling 4         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;emotions.  Are Emotions something physical?</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;These are 4 emotions that are attached to something physical. All         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;these emotions are physical reactions, to physical things.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
They are caused by physical reactions but as you keep telling me, the  <br>
subjective feeling is not the same as those physical reactions, yet I can  <br>
still use information to count those immaterial things.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;So the essential thing that makes you be you (and me be me) is the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;position and velocity of your atoms.        </i><br>
        <br>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why should this be information? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why should data on the position and velocity of an atom be information? <br>
I must not understand the question.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;or is consciousness the processing of the information, and the soul         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the infomation it processes?</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
It's an alternative definition, it's OK but I like mine better because it's <br>
on a lower level so I don't have to explain words like "Ideas".<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If the computer reacts the same as a brain, it is a brain.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;two similar brains without senses would act the same. However,        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;even if the brain cannot detect it's position, it's position can         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;effect it (amount of oxygen, radiation, etc.)  But what would the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;brain care!?</i><br>
          <br>
<p>
If you smother one brain or blow one up with a H Bomb then obviously they <br>
are no longer the same. My point is that if the information on how  my mind <br>
operates is put into a computer and then my body is destroyed my <br>
consciousness does not stop, if two phonographs are synchronized and playing  <br>
the same symphony and you destroy one machine, the music does not stop.          <br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If we could build conscious software to run on other systems        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;(conscious or otherwise) could it be that other consciouses exist         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;within ourselves already.  </i><br>
       <br>
Perhaps.<br>
                                              <br>
