I imagine thoughts and sub-minds on different scales; after all, even our <br>
brains contain very independent subsystems. So one might imagine <br>
hierarchies of hinds where small, fast and less intelligent minds unite <br>
to form larger, slower and more powerful minds which in turn form <br>
metaminds (a bit like the planetary, stellar, galactic and universal <br>
minds of Stapledon's _Star Maker_). I wonder if self-organized <br>
criticality could apply to their sizes? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps this is what is meant by "linear mind" but I have yet to read</i><br>
<i>&gt; AFUTD. </i><br>
<p>
Not really, but it is an interesting idea. A (slight) spoiler for AFUTD:<br>
the canine pack-minds in the book communicate using ultrasound, and if the<br>
bodies of an individual get stringed out its thoughts are similarly<br>
"linearized", they become slow and somewhat dull but the two ends of the<br>
line can communicate fairly quickly. This is used for perimeter sentries; <br>
an attack is immediately relayed along the perimeter. There are mentions<br>
of other ways they can influence their thinking through pack geometry. <br>
