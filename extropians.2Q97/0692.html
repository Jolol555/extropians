<i>&gt;I am no geologist.  I am no economist.  To say we are running out of any </i><br>
<i>&gt;mineral (except oil) just basically seems silly.  The earth's crust should </i><br>
<i>&gt;be strewn with every mineral known to man (and then some....wood and air is </i><br>
<i>&gt;a far more known limiter).</i><br>
<p>
Julian Simon is an economist and I think one of his main points is that<br>
throughout history scarcity itself has helped to preserve the Earth's<br>
natural resources. As long as a resource is considered useful, it is<br>
considered valuable (and worthy) and it will have a price. The more scarce a<br>
resource becomes, the higher the price will go.<br>
<p>
As the price goes up, the number of buyers who think it is still worth the<br>
price will go down. This has a similar effect as conservation, i.e., fewer<br>
users of a resource.<br>
<p>
Simon uses fossil fuel as an example. He says we will NEVER run out of oil.<br>
Technically, he's probably right. As oil becomes scarce, the price rises. By<br>
the time the price becomes cost-prohibitive, other useful alternatives or<br>
substitutes will be invented or discovered. By the time we have very little<br>
oil left, it will be so expensive that no one will want to buy it, so we<br>
will never really run out.<br>
