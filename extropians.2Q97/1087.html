It's rather interesting that this seems to have been the case for a very<br>
long time.  In chimpanzees, the political leader has less children than<br>
average.  This was discovered using DNA testing of hair fibers as well as<br>
feces. I would find it interesting if someone checked on the reproductive<br>
success of the leader's siblings.<br>
Looking at humans, Western Europeans kept a large number of their most<br>
intelligent people out of the gene pool through the priesthood.  In China<br>
those who disagreed with the official views of the historical texts were<br>
cut out of the gene pool either through death or quite literally.  The<br>
human race has been "devolving" for quite some time now but somehow we<br>
manage to pull through.<br>

<i>&gt; I have always enjoyed your comments, Michael.  This one seems to ring</i><br>
true.<br>
<i>&gt;  If a "moron" can't produce anything for society, they have much more</i><br>
time to<br>
<i>&gt; "reproduce".  I once heard a saying that went something like "When a man</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't produce, he'll reproduce".  I'm glad we'll be able to prevent the</i><br>
<i>&gt; devolution of the species, since we are going to develop scientific</i><br>
methods<br>
<i>&gt; to augment all people.  As a non-moron myself, I can also attest to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficulty of finding other non-morons to mate with.  Us thinking people</i><br>
have<br>
<i>&gt; a more difficult time meeting other thinking people, since the morons are</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; majority.  :-)  Shawn M. Johnson</i><br>
