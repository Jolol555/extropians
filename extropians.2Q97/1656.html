Actually, as soon as an individual has reproduced the length of its<br>
life doesn't matter much (for evolution, that is), although there<br>
might be some competition between old and young. <br>
<p>
I think it was Sir Medawar who suggested that we live long enough to<br>
take care of our offspring, plus some extra time due to the built in<br>
redundancy in our system. Living shorter than that would be a<br>
disadvantage (you die before reproducing), living longer would be a<br>
slight disadvantage (competition of resources) but due to the extreme<br>
danger of life in the natural world this is rarely important. Note<br>
that this view suggest that ageing is a gradual breakdown of our<br>
systems simply because they were not designed to last indefinitely,<br>
just long enough. Some species (like pacific salmon) even have<br>
planned obsolescence. <br>
