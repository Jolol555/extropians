One aspect of the extropian philosophy that I am particularly fond, is the<br>
fact that it provides practical information that can be applied to every day<br>
life, as well as far-future concepts.<br>
<p>
The ideas in this thread are part and parcel to actively being extropian.<br>
Being an extropian is a commitment to one's own individual growth and<br>
development=97near as well as long term.  By commitment, I mean an actual<br>
conscious decision to be responsible for one's self (or selves).  Whereas<br>
our being transhuman is an like being part of an "evolutionary stampede,"<br>
our being extropianism can be achieved in a systematic and pragmatic way.<br>
<p>
The theories in achieving same are explained quite carefully in extropian<br>
texts which have been published and offer precise information about how to<br>
apply these practical concepts to one's life.<br>
<p>

<p>
The full editions of _Extropy_ magazine can provide you with such a resource<br>
guide.  It is amazing how rich and resourceful it actually is.  It might<br>
some day in the near future by referred to as an encyclopedic reference for<br>
transhumanism.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sure, I want to be a cyborg, but right now, precisely what can science and</i><br>
technology=20<br>
<i>&gt;make me?</i><br>
<p>
Right now, at this very  moment, science and technology make you transhuman.<br>
Right now, today, science and technology will make you more than human.=20<br>
It's a start.<br>
