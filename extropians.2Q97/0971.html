I'm worried our friend Erik Moeller, he has become infected with a virulent <br>
meme, and I hate to say this and I hope I'm wrong but, I fear he is in <br>
serious danger of becoming that most wretched of creatures, A True Believer. <br>
Erik, it was a bad sign when you ignored the huge difference between East and <br>
West Europe, but it got worse, much worse. It was absolutely terrifying when <br>
you dismissed with a shrug of your shoulders and a wave of you hand the <br>
example of the Koreas, two identical countries except that one is communistic <br>
and one is not and one is a world economic powerhouse and one is a world <br>
economic  basket case. Your prognosis is not good.<br>
  <br>
Nevertheless I haven't completely abandoned the hope that logic can still  <br>
touch you and you'll stop making excuses for moronic dictators who I wouldn't <br>
trust to run my lawnmower much less run my economy. The fact that these thugs <br>
butcher many of their own people and make the rest wish they were dead does <br>
not add their charm. You were singing the praises of Castro, but since he <br>
came to power, millions, quite literally millions, of people have fled his <br>
socialistic paradise for the capitalistic hell of Florida, and they have done <br>
it in incredibly dangerous home made rafts, some little more than a few inner <br>
tubes lashed together. Many thousands have undoubtedly drowned in the attempt, <br>
and still they come. If you can find some shred of objectivity that the <br>
socialism meme has not destroyed, ask yourself this question, why is the raft <br>
traffic 100% (and I don't mean 99%) from south to north rather than the <br>
reverse?                                     <br>
    <br>
                                              John K Clark    johnkc@well.com<br>
