I've long thought something like this might be good for cleaning up space<br>
debris (the big stuff, obviously).  LEO is getting hazardous, and some people<br>
think that in just a few decades there will be so much stuff up there that<br>
there will be a kind of collision chain reaction catatrophe where debris<br>
smashes other debris into smaller bits which in turn smash other debris until<br>
LEO is full of screws and paint chips flying about at 8 klicks per second.<br>
 If that happens, it's a couple hundred years before we can use LEO again and<br>
even crossing LEO would involve meaningful hazard.  I understand that current<br>
philosophy for LEO is to make sure jumk and debris falls back into the<br>
atmosphere, but there's a lot of stuff up there already and in higher orbits<br>
this isn't too practical.<br>
