     Greetings,<br>
     <br>
     There seems to be an abundance of interest in and information provided <br>
     about how to invest in the market economy.  I've yet to thoroughly <br>
     peruse some of the ideas and perspectives since the thread has <br>
     dominated recent digests I receive (although the idea of investing in <br>
     a company like Coca-cola, simply because of its yet untapped <br>
     markets--presumably in developing nations--seems disconnected from the <br>
     consequences both to health and environment that result from its mass <br>
     consumption).  <br>
     <br>
     Why do I keep equating this type of capitalist-get-ahead preoccupation <br>
     with pure narcissism?  Could someone assist me in understanding how <br>
     post-human potentialities tie in with reasoning that doesn't seem to <br>
     link conscious choice with one's personal mission statement?  Perhaps <br>
     I'm in the wrong realm.  I was under the impression that extropian <br>
     principles had a more broad-sweeping implication, that they pushed the <br>
     envelope of sociological, physiological, psychological paradigms.  <br>
     That benevolence would be a natural result of evolved thinking.  I <br>
     keep hoping to find it in the dozen or so digests I've received.  But <br>
     it I'm coming to the conclusion that it's "Ultra-Me", with a <br>
     proclivity towards the accumulation of material "stuff" in the current <br>
     consumer-based, opportunity-scrounging market economy.  Is that the <br>
     game we are forced to play for the time being?  Are we biding time, <br>
     collecting sufficient current-value resources?  Is extropian-ism a <br>
     methodical infiltration of the current motif? (Come to think of it, <br>
     are there any cultural changes that aren't?).<br>
     <br>
     As I re-read this, part of me is concerned about its candor.  I <br>
     apologize for any perceived haughtiness from this critical feedback <br>
     but it's only in an effort to understand and to contribute to the <br>
     definition, creed and itinerary of the post-human agenda.  Your <br>
     patience is requested.  If you feel your guard going up on any of <br>
     these issues, look at that more closely before instinctively clenching <br>
     your virtual fist okay?  I will not engage in any online spats for the <br>
     sake of "being right".  I want to be shown the road map of how you get <br>
     there from here on this route with this method of transporation, if <br>
     you'll indulge the metaphor.  <br>
     <br>
     Fundamentally, what is the division of energy for an extropian between <br>
     "business as usual" and "inventing a future that is heretofore <br>
     unrecognizable"?  As of late in this discussion, the scales are tipped <br>
     into the category of the former and my interest is beginning to wane.  <br>
     I'll stay on the digest for a while yet to see what may come of this.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Rick Knight<br>
