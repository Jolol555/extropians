<i>&gt;Leaving aside the question of personifying genes, which in truth don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;give a damn about anything, I do think you are coloring them a bit</i><br>
<i>&gt;harshly.  There is some advantage to the gene in keeping mom and pop</i><br>
<i>&gt;alive, especially as long as they can breed with fidelity, it just </i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't a strong enough advantage to change the genes quickly. Most of </i><br>
<i>&gt;human evolution took place when old age was not a common cause of death </i><br>
<i>&gt;so it really did not help a lot to have a long natural life span.  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt;not so much that genes don't want old folks around as that it's just</i><br>
<i>&gt;not high on their priority list.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
It would also seem to me that the mechanism of evolution -<br>
mutation-&gt;adaption-&gt;normalization   could be short-circuited by extreme<br>
longevity or immortality.  Swift turnover and ability to issue offspring<br>
that may be more suited to a changing condition are probably evolutionary<br>
positives....<br>
<p>
Not that I'm wild about it as an individual....<br>
