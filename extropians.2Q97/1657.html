<i>&gt; I would like to know your opinion about why are we allowed to age? </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why after millions of years of evolution, we still age?</i><br>
<p>
If you're going to answer your own questions...<br>
<p>
Evolution is a pretty simple mathematical phenomenon once you<br>
understand it.  When applied to living organisms, it's quite<br>
clear that immoratility serves no purpose to a gene's survival,<br>
and in fact is detrimental in many cases.  Once's you're done<br>
reproducing, your body is no longer useful to your genes' further<br>
replication, so no evolutionary pressure to continue is present.<br>
Evolution serves the replicators (genes, roughly speaking),<br>
not organisms.<br>
