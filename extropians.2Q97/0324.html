Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt;The fact that reader attention is valuable and posting is free leads </i><br>
<i>&gt;to an obovious tragedy of the commons that the proposal helps solve. </i><br>
<p>
It may be obvious to you, but it is not obvious to me.  Many of us on <br>
the Internet subscribe to ten or more lists and have learned to <br>
manage the postings quite effectively with our email software.  I <br>
don't believe in restricting bandwidth to any participant in any <br>
manner, because there is plenty of room for everyone and we all <br>
possess filters and delete keys.  I can zap fifteen posts or more at <br>
one keystroke if I want to, I don't grudge the ten seconds that takes <br>
to anyone.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From my perspective, having to make an accounting of my resources </i><br>
every single time I post to a list renders that process more complex <br>
and timeconsuming.  It is clear to me that your goal is to limit the <br>
voices on this list, and I refuse to buy into that concept.  <br>
To me, it is vitally important that persons be encouraged to post <br>
more than they do, because so many wonderful ideas and thoughts are <br>
not getting heard here.  <br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
