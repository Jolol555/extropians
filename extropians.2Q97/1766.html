Seems like I may have punched a button; if so, sorry.<br>
<p>
I didn't recall your "lengthy and articulate" response, and I'm not<br>
interested in debating whether it's possible to so buttress a kneejerk<br>
response (by which I mean literally an immediate neurosomatic state path<br>
triggered by an experience)--I see people do it all the time. Terror<br>
management theory suggests it's a large part of humankind's makeup--but<br>
maybe TMT is a crock.<br>
<p>
A lot of people criticized _The Bell Curve_ without showing signs of having<br>
even read--or perhaps I mean understood--the chapters' precis. And some did<br>
so lengthily and articulately. Or maybe they read and understood but found<br>
a deeper meaning, like who wrote the works of Shakespeare or something, and<br>
it bothered them so much that it swamped the plain text.<br>
<p>
I have no way of knowing if that's what you're doing; that's why I asked.<br>
It seems to me that the matter is subject to debate. Perhaps you disagree.<br>
<p>
If you feel like continuing this thread, try these on for size:<br>
<p>
(po1) I take it that you'd agree with the proposition that all cycles in<br>
human behavior are mythical; is that right?<br>
<p>
(po2) there are no such things as "types" of people (in the "personality<br>
type" sense).<br>
