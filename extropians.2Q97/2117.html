The recently-published account of the attempted invasion of Cuba -- and <br>
Richard Bissell's role in it -- is profoundly disingenuous, and a travesty <br>
of the facts.<br>
<p>
For the real truth, read Richard M. Bissell's posthumously-published <br>
Autobiography, 'Reflections of a Cold Warrior.'  Yale, [1996]<br>
<p>
If you can truly say it isn't an _enthralling_ read, write to me and I'll <br>
refund the price.  In gold.<br>
<p>
<p>
There has been _tremendous_ treachery.<br>
<p>
<p>
I wrote to Richard Bissell a year or so before he died, after finding his <br>
home address in "Who's Who in America"!!! <br>
<p>
Only in America...<br>
<p>
<p>
I asked him for references to his published writings, said I would rathr <br>
have liked to have worked with him, and enclosing an 8 x 10" colour photo <br>
of an SR-71 Blackbird in serene high flight.<br>
<p>
The picture is from Athena.<br>
<p>
<p>
Richard M. Bissell, jr. dreamed the Blackbirds up with Kelly Johnson.<br>

TITLE: '...quick beyond all dreams of speed...'<br>
<p>
TEXT: "Miles above, in the blue-black curve of space, the superstar of winged<br>
espionage makes its home. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than<br>
a fleet of locomotives, and able to leap wide continents in a single bound<br>
is the SR-71 Blackbird. Named for its sooty [*midnight-blue*, actually -TH],<br>
heat-resistant titanium skin, which glows cherry-red as it flashes through<br>
the heavens at Mach 3.32, the successor to the ill-fated U-2 can photograph<br>
100,000 square miles of the earth's surface in less than an hour from a<br>
height of more than 85,000 ft. At the same time, its package of superadvanced<br>
SIGINT sensors can chart electronic battlefields and peer deep over a border<br>
with side-looking radar..."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From "The Puzzle Palace" by V. James Bamford; Sidgwick and Jackson, [1983].</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The 'Blackbirds' are powered by two giant Pratt &amp; Whitney J58 turbo-ramjets.<br>
<p>
<p>
This series of planes was dreamed by Richard M. Bissell, jr. and built by<br>
Kelly Johnson and his team at Lockheed's Burbank Works, California, USA.<br>
<p>
<p>
Fine photos with technical and mission details may be found in "TakeOff."<br>
<p>
<p>
One of my most treasured possessions is a photograph of a USAF SR-71 in<br>
flight, signed by Richard M. Bissell jr, anarchic administrator, polymath, <br>
a genius profoundly dedicated to the survival and success of Western <br>
civilization..<br>
<p>
CONTACT: Copies of the photograph are available from Athena card shops.<br>

   and, alas, blamed quite unjustly for the failure of the attempted <br>
overthrow of Castro's State, which Kennedy fired him for, saying -- <br>
(verbatim) -- <br>
<p>
"If this were a parliamentary government I would have to resign, and you, <br>
as a civil servant, would stay on.  But being the system of government it <br>
is, a presidential government, you will have to resign."<br>

achieving Western victory.<br>
