                          CHILD AND YOUTH POVERTY<br>
<p>
     Child and youth poverty exacerbates the risk behaviors of<br>
     adolescents, and poverty is a growing problem for America's youth<br>
     (Huston, 1992; Lerner, 1993a). By the end of the 1980s<br>
     approximately 20% of America's children and adolescents were poor<br>
     (Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives,<br>
     1991; Davidson, 1994; Hernandez, 1993; Huston, 1992; Huston, et<br>
     al., in press; Simons, Finlay, &amp; Yang, 1991). Moreover, data in<br>
     the 1992 Kids Count Data Book indicate that across the 1980s the<br>
     percentage of children living in poverty in the United States<br>
     increased by 22%. Indeed, this national trend was present in 40<br>
     states, and continues to increase across the nation (Huston,<br>
     1992). Furthermore, of the 12 million American children under the<br>
     age of three years, 25% live in poor families (Carnegie<br>
     Corporation of New York, 1994). In addition, whereas the number<br>
     of children under age six years decreased by 10% between 1971 and<br>
     1991, the number of poor children in this age group increased by<br>
     60% (Carnegie Corporation of New York, 1994).<br>
<p>
     Child poverty occurs in all geographic regions of America. In<br>
     fact, the rates of poverty in rural areas of the Unites States<br>
     are as high as those in the inner cities (Huston, 1992; Jensen,<br>
     1988). Furthermore, the poverty rates were higher in 1989 in<br>
     rural areas than metropolitan areas for every race<br>
     classification, and poverty rates for rural blacks and Hispanics<br>
     exceeded rates for their central city counterparts. The higher<br>
     rural poverty rate exists despite the fact that the rural poor<br>
     tend to be comprised of two-parent families (slightly more than<br>
     half) where at least one of the parents works (67%), as compared<br>
     to metropolitan poor families (25% twoparent families; 56% with<br>
     at least one parent employed; Committee on Ways and Means,1991);<br>
     moreover, poor families in rural areas receive fewer welfare<br>
     benefits and are less likely to live in states that provide Aid<br>
     to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) (Huston, 1992; Jensen,<br>
     1988).<br>
<p>
     However, it must be stressed that the probability of being a poor<br>
     child is not equal across racial or ethnic groups. According to<br>
     the 1993 Kids Count Data Book, across the 1987-1991 period the<br>
     average percentage of European American, African American, and<br>
     Latino children who were poor was 11.4%, 44.1%, and 37.9%,<br>
     respectively. Moreover, among Latino groups, Puerto Rican<br>
     children experienced the highest rate of poverty (40.4%) and<br>
     Cuban children experienced the lowest rate (19.7%) (U. S. Bureau<br>
     of the Census, 1991). In addition, it should be noted that, as<br>
     reported in 1991 by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Asian children<br>
     and Native American children experienced rates of poverty of<br>
     16.7% and 24.9%, respectively.<br>
<p>
     The percentages of children in poverty across the 1987-1991<br>
     period represent increases in the rates of poverty over the last<br>
     10 years for all racial/ethnic groups. For example, from 19791989<br>
     child poverty grew worse by 9% for European Americans, by 5% for<br>
     African Americans, and by 25% for Latinos, respectively (Center<br>
     for the Study of Social Policy, 1993). In terms of absolute<br>
     numbers, data from the 1990 Census indicate that 5.9 million<br>
     European-American children lived in poverty, whereas the<br>
     corresponding numbers of AfricanAmericans, Asian-Americans,<br>
     Native-Americans, and Latinos were 3.7 million, 346,000, 260,000,<br>
     and 2.4 million, respectively (Children's Defense Fund, 1992).<br>
<p>
     Given the differential probability that different racial/ethnic<br>
     groups will be poor, it seems clear that policies and programs<br>
     must be culturally sensitive in order to effect change. In other<br>
     words, both policies and the programs associated with them must<br>
     be culturally competent (Lerner, 1995); they must be able to deal<br>
     effectively with the specific history, culture, values, mores,<br>
     and meaning systems of the youth and families embedded in<br>
     poverty.<br>
<p>
     Indeed, the focus on diversity is crucial because, as noted by<br>
     Huston (1992), race is the most striking and disturbing<br>
     distinction between children whose poverty is chronic and<br>
     children for whom poverty is transitory. For instance, Duncan<br>
     (1992) reports data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics<br>
     indicating that the average African American child in the study<br>
     spent 5.5 years in poverty; in turn, the average non-African<br>
     American child in the study spent only 0.9 years in poverty.<br>
     Furthermore, as with race and ethnicity, poverty is not equally<br>
     distributed across age groups. In 1989, about 20% of children<br>
     younger than age 6 years were poor, and the corresponding rate of<br>
     poverty for 6- to 17-year-olds was about 17%. In turn, the rates<br>
     for Americans aged 18 to 64 years, or aged 65 years or older,<br>
     were about 11% and 13%, respectively (Children's Defense Fund,<br>
     1992).<br>
<p>
     The sequelae of poverty for children and adolescents are<br>
     devastating. Indeed, as Hamburg (1992, p. 48) notes:<br>
<p>
          . . . almost every form of childhood damage is far more<br>
          prevalent among the poor--from increased infant<br>
          mortality, gross malnutrition, recurrent and untreated<br>
          health problems, and child abuse in the early years, to<br>
          education disability, low achievement, delinquency,<br>
          early pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, and failure to<br>
          become economically self-sufficient.<br>
<p>
     Similarly, as Schorr (1988) stresses, poverty creates several<br>
     "rotten outcomes" of youth development. For example, poverty is<br>
     associated with early school failure, with unemployability, with<br>
     long-term welfare dependency, with violent crime, and with<br>
     feelings of hopelessness and despair (McLoyd &amp; Wilson, 1992;<br>
     Schorr, 1988, 1992). Furthermore, McLoyd and Wilson (1992) and<br>
     Klerman (1992) find that poor children live at high risk for low<br>
     self-confidence, conduct problems, depression, and peer conflict.<br>
     In addition, poor children are at risk for encountering severe<br>
     health problems, e.g., infant mortality, lack of immunization<br>
     against common childhood diseases, and physical abuse, neglect,<br>
     and unintended injury (Carnegie Corporation of New York, 1994;<br>
     McLoyd &amp; Wilson, 1992).<br>
<p>
     Moreover, as compared to their nonpoor age-mates, poor youth: Are<br>
     50% more likely to have physical or mental disability; are almost<br>
     twice as likely to have not visited a doctor or dentist in the<br>
     most recent two years of their lives; are 300% more likely to be<br>
     high school dropouts; and are significantly more likely to be<br>
     victims of violence (Simons, et al., 1991). In addition, several<br>
     familial risk factors are associated both with child poverty and<br>
     with a key covariate of poverty--poor school achievement.<br>
<p>
     To illustrate, there are three maternal risk factors associated<br>
     with a child's living in poverty and, as well, with him or her<br>
     being in the lower half of his or her school class. These risk<br>
     factors are: (1) The mother has fewer than 12 years of schooling;<br>
     (2) The mother is not married to the child's father; and (3) The<br>
     mother was less than 20 years old when she had her first child.<br>
     These risk factors affect family life and child development. This<br>
     linkage can be illustrated by reference to other 1993 Kids Count<br>
     Data Book information linking these three risk factors to child<br>
     poverty and to school achievement. Among all 7 to 12 year-old<br>
     children living in America, there was a probability of .79 that<br>
     the child would be poor if all three risk factors were present.<br>
     Similarly, the probability of being in the lower half of one's<br>
     school class was .58 if all these three factors were present. In<br>
     turn, when any two of these risk factors were present the<br>
     probability of being poor or of being in the bottom half of one's<br>
     school class was .48 and .53, respectively. The corresponding<br>
     probabilities involving the presence of only one risk factor were<br>
     .26 and .47 respectively. Finally, when none of these risk<br>
     factors were present the probability of 7- to 12-year old<br>
     children being poor or being in the lower half of their class was<br>
     .08 and .30, respectively.<br>
<p>
     Across the 1980s, the probability increased that there would be a<br>
     link between child poverty and the presence of maternal risk<br>
     factors. That is, as the poverty rates of America's children<br>
     worsen, exceeding now all other major industrialized nations<br>
     (Huston, 1992), the structure of the family is also changing in<br>
     ways that have placed poor children and parents at greater risk<br>
     of problems of family life and individual development. For<br>
     instance, during the 1980s there was a 13% increase in the number<br>
     of children living in single-parent families, a trend present in<br>
     44 states. Thus, during 1987-1991 period, 18.1%, 30% and 56.7% of<br>
     European-American, Latino, and African-American children,<br>
     respectively, lived in single-parent households (Center for the<br>
     Study of Social Policy, 1992). Overall, approximately 25% of<br>
     America's youth live in single parent (and, typically,<br>
     female-headed) families, and poverty rates among female-headed,<br>
     single parent or male-headed, single parent families are much<br>
     higher (46.8% and 23.2%, respectively) than among two-parent<br>
     families (9.0%) (Center for the Study of Social Policy, 1993;<br>
     Hernandez, 1993). Indeed, the poverty rates in singleparent<br>
     households were, by the beginning of the 1990s, 29.8% for<br>
     European American families, 50.6% for African American families,<br>
     and 53% for Latino families (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1991).<br>
     Since the income of female-headed, single-parent households is<br>
     often three or more times lower than two parent households, and<br>
     is also lower than single parent, male-headed households, the<br>
     fact that increasing numbers of children live in these family<br>
     structures means that the financial resources to support<br>
     parenting are less likely to be available (Center for the Study<br>
     of Social Policy, 1993).<br>
<p>
     Moreover, in 1990, 90.3% of children were living with their<br>
     parents, 7.3% were living with other relatives, and 2.3% were<br>
     living outside of the family (Center for the Study of Social<br>
     Policy, 1992). However, only 41.9% of African American children,<br>
     67.7% of Latino children, and 78.5% of European American children<br>
     between the ages of 10 and 14 lived with both their parents<br>
     (Simons, Finlay, &amp; Yang, 1991). In turn, between the ages of 15<br>
     and 17, only 41% , 63%, and 76% of African-American, Latino, and<br>
     European American children, respectively, lived in two-parent<br>
     households (Simons, et al., 1991).<br>
<p>
     As a means to summarize the costs--not only to youth but, as<br>
     well, to all of America--of pervasive child and adolescent<br>
     poverty, we may note Hamburg's (1992, p. 10) view that:<br>
<p>
          Not only are many more children growing up in poverty<br>
          than was the case a decade or two ago, but many more<br>
          are mired in persistent, intractable poverty with no<br>
          realistic hope of escape. They are profoundly lacking<br>
          in constructively oriented social-support networks to<br>
          promote their education and health. They have very few<br>
          models of competence. They are bereft of visible<br>
          economic opportunity. The fate of these young people is<br>
          not merely a tragedy for them, but for the entire<br>
          nation: A growing fraction of our potential work force<br>
          consists of seriously disadvantaged people who will<br>
          have little if any prospect of acquiring the necessary<br>
          competence to revitalize the economy. If we cannot<br>
          bring ourselves to feel compassion for these young<br>
          people on a personal level, we must at least recognize<br>
          that our economy and our society will suffer along with<br>
          them. Their loss is our loss.<br>

<p>
     Given the number of children and families that today are at such<br>
     profound levels of risk, we are faced as a society with a crisis<br>
     so broad that the entire fabric of American society is in serious<br>
     jeopardy (Simons, et al., 1991). With so many of our nation's<br>
     communities facing the likelihood of losing much of their next<br>
     generation to one or more of the several high risk behaviors<br>
     increasingly present among our nation's youth, all of our<br>
     children, whether or not they themselves engage in given risk<br>
     behaviors, nevertheless in effect live in risk--of experiencing<br>
     the adverse economic and employment conditions associated with<br>
     living in a nation that is increasingly globally uncompetitive,<br>
     has a diminished pool of future leaders, offers lowered standards<br>
     of living, requires lower expectations about life chances and, in<br>
     fact, provides fewer and fewer opportunities for healthy and<br>
     wholesome development (Lerner,1993a).<br>
<p>
     Simply, America is wasting its most precious resource: The human<br>
     capital represented by its children (Hamburg, 1992; Lerner,<br>
     1993a, 1993b; Lerner &amp; Miller, 1993). And this destruction of<br>
     human capital is a problem that cuts across race, ethnicity,<br>
     gender, and rural or urban environments (Center for the Study of<br>
     Social Policy, 1992, 1993; Simons, Finlay, &amp; Yang, 1991).<br>
     Accordingly, all of us, all Americans, and certainly all of our<br>
     children and adolescents, are now and for the foreseeable future<br>
     confronted by this crisis of youth development. Of course, the<br>
     pervasiveness of this crisis does not diminish the need to<br>
     prioritize our efforts, In fact, results of evaluation studies of<br>
     preventive interventions indicate that great success can occur<br>
     with programs directed to youth and families most in need<br>
     (Dryfoos, 1990, 1994, in press; Hamburg, 1992; Schorr, 1988).<br>
     Nevertheless, the breadth of the problems affecting our nation's<br>
     youth requires that we see the issues we face as pertaining to<br>
     all of us, and not to only a segment or a subgroup of America.<br>
<p>
     Unfortunately, however, current public policies, and the programs<br>
     associated with them, have proven insufficient to eradicate the<br>
     growth of behavioral risks and of poverty and its sequelae; as<br>
     such, unless effective policy innovations and new programs are<br>
     introduced American will lose both much of its current generation<br>
     of adults and an even larger proportion of the next generation.<br>
     Given the economic and social calamity that such loss will<br>
     engender, it is clear that public policies pertinent to poor<br>
     people must be reconceptualized and redesigned, and that<br>
     innovative and effective youth- and family-serving programs must<br>
     be coupled with these policy changes in order to create and<br>
     sustain the changes in youth and families that will be requisite<br>
     if America is not to fall over the precipice of generational<br>
     destruction.<br>
<p>
     Thus, welfare reform and creative programming must be seamlessly<br>
     combined to address this urgent national problem. As such, we now<br>
     discuss the key policy issues to which welfare reform must speak<br>
     and to delineate the ways in which Extension--with its existing<br>
     youth- and family-serving programs or with new programming<br>
     initiatives it will undertake--possesses the capacity to be the<br>
     outreach arm of reformed welfare policies focused on the diverse<br>
     needs of our nations children and families.<br>
