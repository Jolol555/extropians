Perry is somewhat disappointed that...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; many [...] extropian types don't seem to actively work</i><br>
<i>&gt;towards their long term financial self interest, or their long term</i><br>
<i>&gt;physical survival.</i><br>
<p>
If you mean *at all*, that doesn't include me, so I can't speak to it.<br>
If you mean *enough*, then define enough.<br>
Else you're being vague--no wonder we're all yawning.<br>
<p>
But I'll stay awake a little longer in case you'd like some hints:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Years ago, when Tim May gave me the "if you're so smart, why aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt;you rich" speech, I took him seriously, accepted without letting my</i><br>
<i>&gt;ego get in the way that I'd been screwing up my finances for some</i><br>
<i>&gt;time,</i><br>
<p>
Sounds like Tim pointed out something that was actually an issue for<br>
you in particular, at that particular time.<br>
<p>
Since most people think that ego is one of the main motivations that<br>
drives rich people, maybe you could explain how it can do the reverse.<br>
Do you think others might have similar problems involving ego?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;would not have made any had I not recognised that a problem existed.</i><br>
<p>
Perry, recognition like that that actually effects a person's life<br>
is rare.  Something made it possible for you to see your life differently.<br>
Probably, you already saw your life differently from the way any of us<br>
see our lives.  If you think you have clues that would change our<br>
lives, I'm all ears.  Maybe Tim's mere badgering did it for you but that<br>
isn't usually sufficient for most people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;...wake up calls like the one "Anonymous" posted...</i><br>
<p>
More like hickup calls.  C'mon, Perry, we don't have all day to<br>
spend on this crap either.<br>
<p>
 --Steve<br>
p.s.<br>
<i>&gt;However, I suppose I was expecting something more</i><br>
<i>&gt;spirited than the kind of reply that one could readily have expected</i><br>
<i>&gt;from Ayn Rand when defending her decision to keep chain smoking even</i><br>
<i>&gt;though it was obviously killing her.</i><br>
<p>
You mean she *wasn't* spirited about that!?  Jerome Tuccile said she<br>
called anyone who didn't approve of smoking "anti-life"!  Certainly<br>
that sort of absurdity gets credit for Rand-style spirit?<br>
Funny, trying to imagine Rand giving a disspirited response<br>
to a criticism ("Oh, well, I dunno..."?).<br>
