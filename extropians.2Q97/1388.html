nations<br>

<p>
I've been doing alot of reading on offshore entities lately. St.<br>
Kitts/Nevis is an excellent choice, especially if anonymity is the<br>
goal. Nevis corporations can be run by a Managing Director with all<br>
shares of ownership being Bearer Shares. Your name shows up nowhere.<br>
<p>
An offshore structure would probably include several countries,<br>
leveraging each for their unique tax benefits. My personal goal is to<br>
live on the Island of Anguilla. No income tax, low cost of living, and<br>
a true paradise, year round.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ALso, I recommend doing your banking in a country like the</i><br>
Seyschelles,<br>
<i>&gt; an archipelago nation in the Indian Ocean. Depositing at least $2</i><br>
<i>&gt; million in a Seychellian bank makes one eligible for diplomatic</i><br>
status<br>
<i>&gt; as well as citizenship in the Seychelles. This gets you diplomatic</i><br>
<i>&gt; immunity when traveling or living in any other nation with normal</i><br>
<i>&gt; relations with the Seychelles.</i><br>
<p>
Belize is another. I believe you can get Belizean citizenship (albeit<br>
no diplomatic status) for a much smaller fee. $50,000US comes to mind.<br>
<p>
This is a subject I've been wanting to bring up here for some time.<br>
The concept of PT or Perpetual Traveler is very Extropian to me. In<br>
essence, you are never in one country long enough to be under it's<br>
jurisdiction. This doesnt mean skulking from country to country every<br>
week, but essentially it involves a way to structure your life so that<br>
you have complete freedom to do what you please with your money.<br>
That's a terrible description, but you get the essence.<br>
<p>
Which brings me to an aside. Why do we need, as Extropians who embrace<br>
Intelligent Technology, a physical presence anywhere today? You can<br>
bank by Web (<a href="http://www.sfnb.com">http://www.sfnb.com</a>, 100% online, highly recommended),<br>
email by web (As you can see by my temporary rocketmail.com account)<br>
and even get Fax and Voicemail on the Web. <a href="http://www.jfax.com">http://www.jfax.com</a> is a<br>
service that for about $30/mo you get two phone numbers in a city of<br>
your choice (There's 22, ranging from New York and L.A., to Amsterdam,<br>
London, Paris, and Vancouver. Frankfurt, Miami, Washington, Hong Kong,<br>
Tel Aviv, Beirut, Bombay are on their way) These numbers accept fax<br>
and voicemail, which are then made availible on the Web. I can (and<br>
do) shop on the web, (www.amazon.com, www.isn.com, www.cdnow.com, ad<br>
nauseum, ad infinitum).<br>
<p>
So all I need, anywhere in the world, is a web browser. I've read (and<br>
sent) email standing in the middle of Circuit City playing on a demo<br>
WebTV through rocketmail or hotmail. The new WIRED magazine talks of<br>
Cyber Cafe's in Beijing, where you can web for about $2/hr US.<br>
<p>
With a proper structure of offshore companies and trusts, I can run<br>
most of my life from anywhere in the world.<br>
