Oh, I'd contact all three big long-distance companies.  But AT&amp;T has by far<br>
the most to lose, because they have the largest market share, so they'd<br>
probably pay the most to suppress it.  <br>

<p>
Well, I'm simplifying.  Actually the right business model is to sell it for<br>
$80 and then charge the customers half the money they save every month-- $6<br>
or so.  But even if we couldn't charge them by the month, it would still be<br>
the right thing to charge $80 for them.  Consumers don't buy money-saving<br>
devices unless they pay for themselves in six months or less.  It's crazy,<br>
but my business-savvy wife says this is a well-known fact of retailing.  I<br>
knocked another factor of two off that because at least at first, they will<br>
be unproven devices, and consumers will be wary of dropping $150 on them.<br>
<p>
The reason it makes sense for AT&amp;T to buy this invention is the irrational<br>
short-termism of consumers, and the high information cost of convincing<br>
consumers that it really worth, as you say, upwards of $500.  Unlike the<br>
consumers, AT&amp;T is long-term, and willing to be convinced by e.g. a<br>
prototype deployment with 100 customers, which would only cost $150,000 by<br>
our estimates.<br>
<p>
In a market meeting classical criteria of efficiency, this kind of<br>
suppression would not make sense: the customers would pay what the device<br>
was worth, and the former supplier (AT&amp;T) would be screwed, because they'd<br>
lose just as much money by  buying the patent as by losing customers to the<br>
competition.  <br>
