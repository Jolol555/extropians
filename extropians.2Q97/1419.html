A slightly outlandish thought just came to me: why not using the Extro 3<br>
convention as an opportunity to exchange PGP keys in a nonvirtual meet?<br>
(Face2face contacts being still the most reliable form of communication).<br>
(Mental note for the future: meetings in the flesh are obligatory, but<br>
certainly tedious, proper bandwidth and appropriate infrastructure at a<br>
central location provided, organized future virtual meetings (avatar,<br>
audio, and possibly video feed, area for document (text, gfx, VRML,<br>
whatever) presentation) in a VR environment appear both implementable and<br>
worthwhile. An "Invisible College", and a "Ye Olde Black Sun Lounge and<br>
Pool Club" might both provide a motivation focus, a means of socializing<br>
and might generate unfathomable future spinoffs (enhanced GUIs, &amp;c &amp;c). I<br>
am tight on time currently, but I sure would like to work on this<br>
nonprofit, starting sometime next year. Linux/Java seem the most obvious<br>
implementation platforms. Please offer your comments. <br>
<p>
I cannot really rationalize why particularly crypto (hey, just because you<br>
are paranoid it doesn't mean they are not really after you), but the PGP<br>
key swap party might possibly be of 1) future administrative use for the<br>
list 2) install a more or less secure bootstrap channel for unspecified<br>
future bricabrac transfer 3) current strong crypto ban possibly impending,<br>
be a non-negligeable libertarian attitude display 4) substitute this point<br>
for your favourite neoludd nightmare. <br>
<p>
It would seem to be a good thing if the Extropy Institute (EI) would<br>
generate and distribute among participant sone key for secure all-&gt;EI<br>
link. See no much use for the reverse direction, but still see no harm in<br>
doing this also. <br>
<p>
As I am really clueless about crypto, knowlegeable persons please step<br>
forth and comment. <br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
