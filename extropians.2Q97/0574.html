One problem I have noted is that many quite interesting threads on these<br>
lists develop new insights into various subjects, diverge and then die<br>
out. Although they are archived, often the real gems are hard to<br>
rediscover, and old questions reappear after a few months. <br>
<p>
What I would like to see if we could distill the results of some threads<br>
into a usable form, such as a web page or an article in Homo Excelsior. <br>
When a thread starts to get useful, somebody takes on the responsibility<br>
as an editor, bringing together the posts into a whole and then publishing<br>
it. <br>
<p>
The main problem to solve is how to get these editors: while I think just<br>
about everyone here will agree that the idea is good, actually *doing*<br>
something must overcome some mental inertia (especially when many <br>
participate; diffusion of responsibility is a problem here). Do we have <br>
any brilliant ideas on how to implement this? <br>
