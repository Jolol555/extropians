Perry complained at length about CALYK, and his inane hydrogen car, taking<br>
up space on the list.  Here's how I avoid being annoyed by such things.  <br>
<p>
I subscribe to the Filtered Extropians list, promulgated by The Low Golden<br>
Willow, phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu.  This list broadcasts a daily compilation<br>
of all the messages sent to the main list that are by authors that Mr.<br>
Willow likes.  I also subscribe to the main list.  My mail reading program<br>
(Eudora)  sorts the messages so I can look at the filtered version first.<br>
If I see an interesting thread in the filtered version, I can dip into the<br>
full list and read the entire thread.  I also read messages in the full list<br>
from people whose names I don't recognize, so I don't unfairly exclude<br>
people just because they're new.  Otherwise, I just delete the messages from<br>
the full list unread.  My tastes seem to be sufficiently similar to Mr.<br>
Willow's that just reading the filtered list means I don't miss much good stuff.<br>
<p>
In short: why read the National Enquirer when you can read the Economist and<br>
merely refer to the Enquirer?<br>
<p>
Here's a pre-emptive strike against those who will accuse me of elitism:<br>
Please come join the elite!  All you have to do is think well and write well!<br>
