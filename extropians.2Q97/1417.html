<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;many years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This basic idea makes sense, but it is important to base your belief</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;It sounds like you are making assumptions. I chose Coca Cola because I am</i><br>
<p>
 Of course. The reasons you initially gave for buying Coke were<br>
indistinguishable from those of a typical investor, so the simplest<br>
hypothesis that explained your reasons was that you were following the crowd.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;reasonably familiar with the management and the major changes they made</i><br>
<i>&gt;several years ago, and because I have discussed the company with those who</i><br>
<i>&gt;know much about it and have been convinced that it has long-term growth</i><br>
<i>&gt;still ahead of it.</i><br>
<p>
 This reasoning is better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The same (only more so) would have been true if I had bought Microsoft,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which I certainly would have done if its stock hadn't been at an all-time</i><br>
<i>&gt;high (though still a good value).</i><br>
<p>
 It's a mistake to avoid a stock because it's at an all-time high.<br>
This seems to be one of the circumstances the average investor is most<br>
likely to underestimate a company. I suspect that this results from something<br>
like a belief in the labor theory of value - if there was a consensus<br>
that a company's fair value was in a certain range, then there seems to<br>
be a clear presumption that it ought to be continue in that range.<br>

<p>
 This should reduce your confidence, as it indicates that there is little<br>
room for mainstream investors to improve their opinion of Coke.<br>
 Remember that unless your information is better than that of the<br>
people who are selling Coke, you have no reason to think you will<br>
outperform them.<br>
