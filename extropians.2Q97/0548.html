<i>&gt; &gt; twice as much</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  money is stolen from working families as is necessary for education,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So simplistic. Half truth.Somewhat valid comment made less valid by</i><br>
<i>&gt; oversimplifying relationships. Context dropped intentionally.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some families likely feel this is stealing - and the compulsary nature of</i><br>
<i>&gt; taxation does not work out for everyone. This is a valid point. Some find it</i><br>
<i>&gt; acceptable, others not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Qualified in that light it *could* be fairly called stealing. </i><br>
<i>&gt; But not if I agree to pay it willingly. And I would.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, among those who favor educational taxation, some agree that if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; was spent better,  we would willingly pay for social institutions like</i><br>
<i>&gt; schools, and would even spend *more* on education ( for the selfish reason of</i><br>
<i>&gt; wanting a better, more  advanced society) - even some who do not have school</i><br>
<i>&gt; aged children. The problem is far more complex, and in most debates,</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments abound as to where and how the money is misused and if private</i><br>
<i>&gt; sector schools not controlled by and involving less govt. money would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; better. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then we get into voluntary taxation, trusts, school bonds, vouchers, etc.</i><br>

Apparently your idea of "too simplistic" is "says something meaningful<br>
clearly enough to be understood."  The actual content of the statement,<br>
that public education costs twice as much as private education of better<br>
quality, you evade altogether so you can react to my choice of the<br>
word "stolen" to describe taxes.  Fine, substitute "taken"--a simple<br>
fact of reality you can't evade--and then deal with the actual content<br>
of the assertion, which I stand by.  I also happily stand my my use of<br>
the word "stolen", but if that gets in the way of your ability to apply<br>
ordinary reason to an assertion, then go ahead and pick a less loaded<br>
word for your own use.<br>
