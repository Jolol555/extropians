Thanks, although I must admit I wasn't interested (or even aware) of the <br>
difference in approach. I have probably been dealing with the biosciences <br>
too long :-)<br>
<p>
I actually think we need to learn how to build general purpose nanites<br>
that can work in complex environments, although it is a good idea to <br>
shelter the assemblers. I'm more and more coming to think of my system as <br>
an ant-colony: worker nanites dig our raw materials and extract energy to <br>
feed a pampered central assembler making new hives. It works in nature <br>
and ought to work well in regolith. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't want to restart the flame wars over whether 'positional </i><br>
<i>&gt; control' is practical for building macro-scale devices or not, and I </i><br>
<i>&gt; guess I'll just have to wait for Anders to finish his article, but I </i><br>

<i>&gt; chemical-signaling approach to nano-construction that he was </i><br>
<i>&gt; suggesting.</i><br>
<p>
Me too :-) I know some alife people are working on ant-like simulations of<br>
chemical signals, but I would like to do morphogenesis too. For example,<br>
once the colony has reached sufficient size it should react and change its<br>
behvior. This might be acheieved by having each nanite produce slight<br>
amounts of a signal substance, and when the concentration goes above a<br>
certain level the assembler begins to build nanites to build new hives, or<br>
parts for a macroscopic project. Almost exactly what happens in slime<br>
molds. Once the hives or parts are finished, a chemical signal would stop<br>
their production and a new phase could begin. If a hive was damaged, it<br>
would revert to the more basic rebuiilding level before working on the<br>
macro level. <br>
