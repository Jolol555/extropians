Yes, but how much should we pay them :-)<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Friday night I was listening to a Bio prof talk about the monkeys he</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  uses in his research.  They are rugged and damn smart, and are trained</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  to help run each new experiment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  If any brand of AI researcher had a computer that good, they'd</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  probably think they were very close to the holy grail.  But here we do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  have such computers, and we don't put them to much use besides</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  studying their brains.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  So why is it exactly that we haven't trained such monkeys to do real</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  jobs around in our society?  Couldn't they be trained to be security</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  guards, to sweep streets, to wash cars, or to run machines in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  factories?  Yes language is important for many jobs, but for all jobs?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Sure they like to be with each other, but couldn't teams of monkeys</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  work together? </i><br>
