Rats fed high-fat but low calorie diets do about as well as rats fed low-fat<br>
low-calorie diets.  So the conclusion is that the *primary* health<br>
disadvantage of fat is that it makes you eat more.  Fat may have other<br>
disadvantages wrt heart disease or reproductive cancers (research is<br>
inconclusive; I've seen studies both ways).  With humans there is little<br>
research on the effect of changing fat intake without changing calorie intake<br>
- over a lifetime, these are correlated and very hard to separate.<br>
