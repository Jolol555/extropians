The opportunities for women in society have opened up a lot in the last<br>
few decades.  Today we teach our kids that there are no differences in<br>
what boys and girls can expect as far as career opportunities open to<br>
them.  (Even if this is not completely true, it is what they are taught.)<br>
We try to encourage girls in particular to look past traditional roles<br>
and to seriously pursue professions and work roles that were closed to<br>
them in the past.  I believe it is a better society which allows women<br>
this kind of freedom.<br>
<p>
Suppose I knew that society was going to change, and that women were going<br>
to go back to being stuck in the home, called upon to greet their husbands'<br>
return from work with a fresly-cleaned house, a pair of slippers, and a<br>
delicious home-cooked meal.  I wouldn't change what I teach my daughter.<br>
I find those old limitations abhorrent.<br>
<p>
Maybe this makes me a bad parent.  I wouldn't be preparing my child for<br>
what society is going to expect of her.  She could face a hard time in a<br>
world where she wants to be an aerospace engineer but everyone else expects<br>
her to be Suzy Homemaker.<br>
<p>
My justification would be that, with enough determination, she could<br>
probably get past the kinds of sex role limitations which we have seen<br>
within the last hundred years or so.  So unless the social changes are<br>
extremely drastic and sudden, she can probably still expect considerable<br>
freedom in choosing her life's work.  Furthermore, her efforts to take on<br>
non-traditional roles will play some incremental part to retard whatever<br>
social changes are occuring, changes which I would oppose.<br>
<p>
Likewise the idea of encouraging my son to play team sports so that he'll<br>
be all set when he gets drafted into the army or when Party membership is<br>
a prerequisite for success is an equally unpleasant prospect.  I simply<br>
don't think in these terms.  I have an individualist philosophy, and I<br>
am raising my kids to pursue what interests them personally, without much<br>
regard to what society wants.<br>
<p>
While discussions of future sex roles may be interesting in their own<br>
right, they wouldn't have much effect on my child-rearing practices.<br>
