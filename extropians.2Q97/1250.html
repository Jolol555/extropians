***********************************************************************<br>
<p>
   JOURNAL OF MEMETICS - Evolutionary Models of Information <br>
               Transmission (JOM-EMIT)<br>
<p>
***********************************************************************<br>
<p>
JOM-EMIT is a new scientific journal published exclusively on the Web, <br>
at URL:<br>
<p>
     <a href="http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit">http://www.cpm.mmu.ac.uk/jom-emit</a><br>
<p>
The journal has no subscription fee.<br>
<p>
JOM-EMIT is the first peer-reviewed journal devoted to the development <br>
of the memetic perspective. This perspective looks at culture, <br>
communication and information transmission as evolutionary phenomena, <br>
governed by the mechanisms of variation, replication and selection. The <br>
concept of "meme" was proposed by Richard Dawkins as 'a unit of <br>
cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation'. The vagueness of this<br>
initial <br>
description may explain the present diversity of views on what a meme <br>
really is, and how the memetic model can be used. JOM-EMIT wishes to <br>
clarify these issues, by stimulating a constructive dialogue between the <br>
active researchers in the field. More specifically JOM-EMIT seeks to <br>
discuss the following topics related to memetics: <br>
<p>
- Comparisons of different mechanisms and models of evolutionary <br>
processes, possibly in distinct fields of inquiry. <br>
<p>
- Philosophical or theoretical issues concerning epistemology and <br>
evolution <br>
<p>
- Boundaries of the evolutionary approach <br>
<p>
- Empirical research on memetic processes <br>
<p>
- Models of meme generation and meme spread <br>
<p>
- Fundamental approaches aimed at structuring the field of memetics as a <br>
science <br>
<p>
Editorial Board: Gary Boyd, Bruce Edmonds (also publisher), Liane <br>
Gabora, Francis Heylighen, Mark Mills, Hans-Cees Speel (managing <br>
editor), and Mario Vaneechoutte.<br>
<p>
Advisory Board: Gary Cziko, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, David <br>
Hull, and Aaron Lynch.<br>
<p>
The JOM-EMIT site contains two mailing lists: an announcement list for <br>
the distribution of abstracts of new papers to all subscribers, and a <br>
discussion list for open debate on the submitted papers, and other <br>
memetics related issues. You can subscribe to these lists via the<br>
Journal's <br>
home page.<br>
<p>
                    CONTENTS<br>
<p>
The first issue (May-September) of JOM-EMIT is now online. It <br>
contains four papers and one book review:<br>
<p>
"The Six Essentials? Minimal Requirements for the Darwinian <br>
Bootstrapping of Quality" by William H. Calvin<br>
<p>
"Cultural R/K Selection" by Agner Fog<br>
<p>
"The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity" by Liane Gabora<br>
<p>
"Macromemetics and the Re-unification of Philosophy" by Derek <br>
Gatherer<br>
<p>
Book review: "Evolutionary Paradigms in the Social Sciences. Special <br>
Issue, International Studies Quarterly 40, (September, 1996)" by Francis <br>
A. Beer.<br>
<p>
New papers will appear continuously when they are accepted for <br>
publication.<br>
<p>
                 CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
<p>
We invite interested authors to submit papers for the journal, along<br>
with <br>
information on the author, his/her address and affiliations, at the<br>
journal's <br>
email address:<br>
<p>
     jom-emit@sepa.tudelft.nl<br>
<p>
All submitted papers will be anonymously reviewed. They will only be <br>
accepted for publication if approved by at least two referees.<br>
<p>
Controversial papers of high quality can be followed by commentaries by <br>
request of the author after they are published (similar to the<br>
commentary <br>
structure the "Brain and Behavioral Sciences" uses, although JOM-EMIT <br>
uses commentary only as an option after a paper is already published). <br>
This means that a number of peers write a short comment, to which the <br>
author can reply in a concluding short paper.<br>
<p>
We also wish to invite letters which criticize published papers, and<br>
book <br>
reviews relevant to the journal's aims.<br>
<p>
