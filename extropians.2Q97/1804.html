<i>&gt; 	You should look into the Turing test.  Exactly how do you</i><br>
<i>&gt; confirm your spiritual perception of colour as such and how do you</i><br>
<i>&gt; know that a simulation wouldn't as well?  Do you believe in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ghost in the machine idea or are you neuroncentric?</i><br>
<p>
	I am neuroncentic.  But, there must be a bit more to the<br>
neural process than we can now abstractly observe.  When we are<br>
consciously aware of something, like a tree that we are looking at,<br>
neurons are producing some kind of real phsycial phenomenon that is<br>
this conscious awareness.  This awarenes is something tangible and<br>
real in our subjective experience.<br>
<p>
	Any physical process that can assume various distinguishable<br>
states can abstractly represent or model informaion.  For an abstract<br>
machine the particular nature of the physical process isn't important.<br>
It can be magnetic flux in a hard disk or a voltage state of a<br>
transistor.  But, we use a very specific kind of physical phenomenon<br>
to represent conscious information.  A conscious qualia such as red<br>
can abstractly represent a one or a zero or light of a particular wave<br>
length.  And a pattern of voltages on a bus can abstractly represent<br>
the same thing.  An important thing is that a quale representing<br>
information is fundamentally very different than a pattern of voltages<br>
on a bus.  When talking about consciousness, the particular qualities<br>
of the particular phenomenal physical process being used (i.e. what it<br>
is like) to represent the information is important.  There is<br>
phenomenally more to the representation than just the abstract data.<br>
<p>
	Just as we can now look into a computer and see if it<br>
represents data in a big or little indian format since we have the<br>
proper tools and understanding, when we have the proper tools and<br>
understanding of this phenomenal process which neurons use to<br>
consciously represent informaiont, we will be able to objectively see<br>
the particular sets of qualia a brain uses to represent information.<br>
Hence, the Turing test will not be a problem once we understand or<br>
discover the physical process that neurons use to represent<br>
information in our consciousness.<br>
