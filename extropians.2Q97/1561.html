 I believe Sean has this right, I remember reading this also. The<br>
pigeons were working on an assembly line that manufactured gelatin<br>
capsules, they were being trained to recognize deformed capsules<br>
called "skags" as I recall and peck the appropriate button. The<br>
health concerns about the pigeons doomed the project.<br>
