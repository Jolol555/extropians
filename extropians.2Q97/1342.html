<i>&gt;     Greetings,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     There seems to be an abundance of interest in and information provided </i><br>
<i>&gt;     about how to invest in the market economy.  I've yet to thoroughly </i><br>
<i>&gt;     peruse some of the ideas and perspectives since the thread has </i><br>
<i>&gt;     dominated recent digests I receive (although the idea of investing in </i><br>
<i>&gt;     a company like Coca-cola, simply because of its yet untapped </i><br>
<i>&gt;     markets--presumably in developing nations--seems disconnected from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;     consequences both to health and environment that result from its mass </i><br>
<i>&gt;     consumption).  </i><br>
<p>
 I'm unsure about the environmental effects of Coke, but anyone who<br>
had read much Extropian writings about health would avoid drinking <br>
drinking high calorie, low vitamin foods such as regular Coke (the<br>
health effects of diet Coke are less clear).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Why do I keep equating this type of capitalist-get-ahead preoccupation </i><br>
<i>&gt;     with pure narcissism?  Could someone assist me in understanding how </i><br>
<p>
 I don't know why. I'd say Max's investment in Coca-cola is based on a<br>
prediction of consumer demand for Coke that is unrelated to Max's<br>
opinion of whether Coke is a good drink, and reflects a good deal of<br>
respect for the judgements of Coke drinkers whose values probably differ<br>
from Max's value. I'd say this is very far from narcissism. Maybe you<br>
meant greed instead?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     post-human potentialities tie in with reasoning that doesn't seem to </i><br>
<i>&gt;     link conscious choice with one's personal mission statement?  Perhaps </i><br>
<i>&gt;     I'm in the wrong realm.  I was under the impression that extropian </i><br>
<i>&gt;     principles had a more broad-sweeping implication, that they pushed the </i><br>
<i>&gt;     envelope of sociological, physiological, psychological paradigms.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;     That benevolence would be a natural result of evolved thinking.  I </i><br>
<p>
 If you expect Extropian investments to be motivated by altruism, you<br>
don't understand Extropianism very well.<br>
