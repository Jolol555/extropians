 Dear fellow extropians,<br>
<p>
Why is it that I am never amazed at the lengths people go to to<br>
rationalize the taking of another persons life?<br>
<p>
Those of us who have been in combat know far too well what taking a life<br>
is all about.<br>
<p>
Can we please end this absurd string right here?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
A.M. Genen<br>
