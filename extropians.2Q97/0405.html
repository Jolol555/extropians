Though this is X-Files, which exists in an even stranger universe than we<br>
do.  Notice that the grant they were trying for was from the NSA?  Heh,<br>
right.  Interstingly, they didn't talk about the horrors of a world where<br>
you could be frozen and revived.  The guy from the future ranted about how<br>
awful it was that people in his time could know all possible futures.  Very<br>
confused use of the many worlds hypothesis at the end.<br>
<p>
Ugh, I can't believe I'm talking about X-Files.  I hate being a Fan!<br>
