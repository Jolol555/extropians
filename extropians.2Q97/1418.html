<i>&gt;     Right now, the soft drink companies (as well as the tobacco) companies </i><br>

<i>&gt;     to have their products but are totally oblivious to the consequences, </i><br>
<p>
 I am a lot more cautious than you are about assuming that consumers<br>
who evaluate products differently than I do are ignorant. I don't want<br>
other people deciding what's best for me as a consumer, and I expect<br>
other people to not want me trying to make their decisions for them.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     health wise and environment wise as well (can you imagine all of China </i><br>
<i>&gt;     with Coke with dispensed ice in plastic/paper cups?)</i><br>
<p>
 Trying to fight trash by moving investment dollars out of companies<br>
whose environmental effects are as ordinary as Coke's is one of the<br>
least cost-effective strategies around, as you are fighting a very<br>
broad profit motive. If a company clearly stands out for doing things<br>
that neither I nor the people affected by those actions approve of,<br>
I will avoid them, but I don't expect this to accomplish much unless<br>
it is targetted against actions that offend a large fraction of the<br>
population.<br>
 A more effective strategy for environmentalism is to channel people's<br>
selfishness in the right direction, by improving legal systems so that<br>
the costs of environmental harm are born by people who have control<br>
over those costs. For example, taxpayer financed trash collection should<br>
be replaced by a system in which people who want their trash removed pay<br>
something related to the costs of disposing of that trash.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     So, no, altruism need not be the primary goal of an Extropian way of </i><br>
<i>&gt;     thinking but it certainly should be pressing on the minds of those </i><br>
<i>&gt;     that are claiming a post human destiny and it should show up in their </i><br>
<i>&gt;     lifestyle.  You don't evolve just one part of your existence, you </i><br>
<i>&gt;     evolve the whole thing: mind, body and spirit.</i><br>
<p>
 Of course I should try to evolve all aspects of my existence. I see<br>
no reason why altruism is the right direction to evolve towards.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If Extropians have no </i><br>
<i>&gt;     concern of the latter, it's an incomplete and imbalanced philosophy </i><br>
<i>&gt;     and I should continue my search for a more full-spectrumed approach to </i><br>
<i>&gt;     conscious, biological and social evolution.</i><br>
<p>
 I see no reason to expect any one philosophy to be complete.<br>
