Hmm, my bovo-sacrimeter gives clear indications that sacred cows are<br>
present in this debate. Please take the proper precautions and especially <br>
avoid rhetoric (it feeds them). <br>

I hope we will be able to remedy that in the near future. People are <br>
already doing alife simulations of simple societies (usually rather <br>
ant-like) and of course the evolution of cooperation. It would be <br>
interesting (and probably only a matter of time) to study a more <br>
realistic model where different social structures could be tested. <br>
Simulations support reason, at least when everyone is allowed to test <br>
them and their basic assumptions are known.<br>

Suggestion: why not explain this clearly and logically in a way (say) a <br>
ten-year old could understand, and then let your opponent put forth his <br>
model in the same simple way. Then we can start analyzing what reason <br>
tells us (but don't forget history; reason isn't always right). <br>
