<i>&gt; &gt;I think E-Prime fails to solve the problem, and even exacerbates it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;by making people think they can avoid fuzzy thinking by playing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;silly word-games with a broken language instead of doing actual work</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to think and communicate more clearly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; E-prime generally helps with clarity and honesty.  It bars passive voice</i><br>
<i>&gt; (mistakes were made) and unsubstantiated generalizations (people are dumb).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  You can certainly get around these obstacles, but at least e-prime makes you</i><br>
<i>&gt; think about actors, assertors, and evidence.  When I write in e-prime, I tend</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have to mention actors, assertors and evidence, and that makes my writing</i><br>
<i>&gt; easier to understand and harder to misunderstand.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you *want* to hide the actors, assertors, or evidence, you certainly can.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  You often have to use expressions even harder to understand than the passive</i><br>
<i>&gt; voice you avoided in the first place.  Still, using e-prime encourages zip</i><br>
<i>&gt; and clarity.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that using E-Prime or [shameless plug] Lojban can often enlighten.<br>
The message to which I replied suggested far more than merely using E-Prime<br>
as an interesting exercise, but actually proposed that we point out postings<br>
here that violated it.  I suggest we do something far more valuable: point<br>
out actual sloppy thought, however expressed, and applaud clear thought,<br>
however expressed.  "To be" and passive voice can be used quite properly<br>
and effectively (as in this sentence where omitting the actor is quite<br>
deliberate to imply a general rule), and I make no apologies for either.<br>
