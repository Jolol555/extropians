Here's a tip: in the header of your pages, put a paragraph of 0 size<br>
type that has multiple copies of all the key words and phrases. Since<br>
the header is what gets read first, even engines that read only the<br>
first 50 or 100 words will flag you as having multiple mentions of the<br>
key phrases you think people will use to search with, so your pages will<br>
come up first on the returns list as having the most relevancy to the<br>
query.<br>
<p>
I've used the private registry services, and they are a pain in the<br>
butt. Each still expects you to fill out all the info for each type of<br>
search engine. Just to register a corporate site I authored with 20<br>
engines via the Submit It site, it took a day and a half of work online<br>
to fill out all the forms and reply to their email replies for verifying<br>
the data, plus fixing the inevitable screwups their automated systems<br>
cause.<br>
<p>
I find that working with link exchanges is best, cause when someone else<br>
registers their pages, and they have links to you, the spiders follow<br>
the links to you. My "Mikey's Rail Nut Heaven" page wound up registered<br>
with a few search engines within a few days of me putting it up cause<br>
someone else found the page via my main page and liked it so  much they<br>
put up links to it.<br>
<p>
Keep in mind, despite their requests to only register one page on your<br>
site, everyone ignores it and registers all their pages, cause otherwise<br>
the spider takes 4-6 months to check out all of the pages, never mind<br>
what they say about 2-3 day service. SO if you've got time on your<br>
hands, register all of your pages, but edit your pages a head of time<br>
with the little keyword gimmick to make your pages have extra relevancy.<br>
