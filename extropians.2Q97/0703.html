Adaptation through DNA is looking fairly obsolete these days, if you<br>
haven't noticed.  Genetic alteration of children; construction of<br>
children to order; application of technology such that given a decent<br>
brain the natural body doesn't really matter.  One could have diverse<br>
children by mixing genes from more sources than sex could have<br>
accomodated (or accessed, with artificial genes) or by copying oneself<br>
and letting the clones claw out new niches in their desperation to be<br>
different from their siblings.<br>
<p>
Whether this 'asexual' reproduction matches what was being talked about<br>
in the papers, I don't know.  I haven't read the sex-connected papers<br>
yet, but Robin's comments made me think that the mechanisms were based<br>
on the children being genetically identical to the parent, rather than<br>
sharing half their genes.<br>
