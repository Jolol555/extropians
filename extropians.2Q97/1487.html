The only wearable I've seen (I didn't actually get to use it, just saw<br>
some graphics demonstrating what it was supposed to be like) projected<br>
incoming data onto the inside of a pair of 'sunglasses' which also<br>
incorporated a miniature video camera to broadcast video back over the Net<br>
to his home machine. I certainly wouldn't want to use a wearable display<br>
which wasn't at least semi-transparent. <br>

No, several, no... there was a 'mass-market' Forth machine for sale in the<br>
UK about fifteen years ago. Much better than those running BASIC, but<br>
sadly too late to compete. <br>

Heretic ;-). If past experience is anything to go by then in five hundred<br>
years time the Jupiter-sized brains will still be running Unix ;-). I do<br>
rather like the look of what I've seen of Plan 9 though. <br>

<i>&gt; Brittle?  Who _dares_ to say brittle? </i><br>
<p>
What's brittle about Unix? I regularly get 100+ days of uptime on Linux,<br>
so much so that I had trouble remembering my password last time I rebooted<br>
my machine at work and had to log in again. Insecure, perhaps, but hardly <br>
brittle.<br>

<i>&gt; holographic store.  What is 'save'? You mean your computer can drop state,</i><br>

<p>
One advantage of using 'vi' ;-). <br>

P.S. The web archive of the list seems to be stuck again... last time I<br>
checked it hadn't updated for a couple of days. <br>
