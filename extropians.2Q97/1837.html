Chris Thompson recently wrote that he believes that winning elections by<br>
influencing the media appears to be the sum total of expedient political<br>
experience.<br>
<p>
I suspect that -- like most people -- Chris has never been inside a<br>
political clubhouse or participated in a major political party caucus.<br>
<p>
The reality of politics substantially transcends the election of<br>
candidates. Organizational mechanics in professional political<br>
organizations such as the Democratic and Republican Partys in the US or<br>
the Labor and Conservative Partys in the UK are quite complex. This goes<br>
far beyond the usual focus on Presidential or PM selection by the media<br>
and the sometimes to easily influenced voter. <br>
Obviously, the media will continue to be a problem if it fails to<br>
provide substantive enlightenment and diversity of opinion and fact<br>
instead of its usual simplistic focus on the lowest common denominator. <br>
Realistically, I wish I knew of an easy way to get more people to think,<br>
and think primarily beyond the self. <br>
<p>
If a small group of intellectual activists would climb into the somewhat<br>
soiled seats in the political clubhouses of the US and the UK (among<br>
other democracys) and attempt to restructure their ideological fixations<br>
into a far greater degree of open-mindedness could we better promote<br>
some of the more currently applicable theories of the Extropians?<br>
