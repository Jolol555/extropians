Somebody mentioned that bit about yelling fire in a crowded theater, I said:<br>
    <br>
 That cliche originally came from the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes <br>
 (1841-1935), he used it in one of his decisions that upheld the conviction  <br>
 of a man imprisoned for saying America should not be in the First World War. <br>
 Years later Holmes said it was the worst decision he made in his entire <br>
 legal career and he cringed whenever he heard somebody quoting his famous <br>
 saying.<br>
  <br>
Several have written me asking for a source.  The decision was called  <br>
"Schenck vs United States" and came out in 1919, you can read about it on <br>
page 942 of "The Oxford Companion To The Supreme Court" edited by Kermit L  <br>
Hall. <br>
<p>
On page 422 of the book "Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes"  by G Edward White is  <br>
a letter Holmes wrote to a friend talking about this and several similar  <br>
decisions he wrote:<br>
<p>
 "I greatly regretted having to write them and, between ourselves, that the   <br>
  government pressed them".<br>
<p>
In another letter he expressed his sorrow, and I don't think guilt would be <br>
too strong a word, that Schenck was still in jail:<br>
<p>
 "I hope the president will pardon him and some other poor devils I have  <br>
  more sympathy"<br>
<p>
It's ironic that in his day Holmes was one of the leading advocates of free <br>
speech but today his most remembered saying is used by those who wish to  <br>
stifle it.                                      <br>
