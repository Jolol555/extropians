That seems like a reasonable assessment. Of course, people might<br>
contractually agree not to go nude within common areas of a private<br>
contractually based community, but that's of course not what you are<br>
talking about.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt; think it is "evil" to be nude.</i><br>
<p>
Of course it isn't "evil" except to supersitious people like certain<br>
religious sects.  On the other hand, I think it's frequently tasteless<br>
-- most people's bodies are not particularly appetizing, and look<br>
better when clothed to conceal the lack of care that has been taken to<br>
maintain them.  Tastelessness, of course, is not a crime -- if it<br>
were, wearing a loud hawaiian shirt would be just as "evil" as<br>
nudity. Neither should be legally sanctioned.<br>
