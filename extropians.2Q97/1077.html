This is, as others have pointed out, completely wrong. The digestive <br>
juices in the stomach are acidic, and the juices in the intestine alkaline. <br>
Even if some foods tend to push the balance in some directions, the <br>
gastrointestinal system has some pretty clever regulatory systems that <br>
notices if the pH is wrong and fix it (it should be noted that the <br>
intestine has a quite complex nervous system of its own, with very loose <br>
connections to the nervous system "proper").<br>

<p>
An amusing paragraph, and rather typical for what one will hear from many <br>
alternative health groups. Rot does not normally occur in the stomach, <br>
and if it did we would have much bigger problems than an unloving <br>
disposition (toxic megalocolon comes to mind). As for poisons and <br>
headaches, is this the reason bulls are so angry? After all, there is <br>
plenty of fermentation going on in bovine stomaches. <br>

Thanks for posting this text. While I disagree with it, it is good to go <br>
back to the sources and look at what they say. <br>
