Hmm, this might be relevant to my thoughts about the growth and <br>
differentiation of technospheres. Once a species starts spreading across <br>
space, it would tend to differentiate as different evolutionary <br>
pressures have different strengths in different parts of the growing <br>
technosphere. Near the edges, rapid growth and colonization would be <br>
preferable, perhaps creating a grey goo-ish form of the species bent on <br>
expanding quickly (why? because their ancestors were the most expansive). <br>
<p>
At the core matter is under control, resources limited but the amount of <br>
information (and presumably processing) maximal. This might be the land <br>
of the careful Bayesians. They grow mainly memetically rather than <br>
physically (although I would suspect they were very interested in <br>
technological growth to keep an edge against the "smart barbarians" <br>
at the fringes), and in the face of resource limitations are likely to <br>
favor megaengineering to ensure their long term future (Dyson spheres, <br>
stellar lifting and whatnot). <br>

I think you are interpreting Robin's idea in a slightly extreme way. <br>
Social conformity isn't likely to be enforced if you assume clone/xox <br>
reproduction, it would just be a natural consequence of the form of <br>
reproduction (although there would be a drift). Remember that there is <br>
likely also competition, and these rational beings would act to ensure <br>
their long-term results which means that they would be much more likely <br>
to do something about future ecological disasters or other dangers than <br>
less risk-aversive beings (like the sf males? "Yeah, I know the black <br>
hole in the reactor is unshielded, but I trust my ship, and besides, <br>
real men don't get radiation sickness..."). <br>
<p>
But I agree, we need to get off this rock. <br>
