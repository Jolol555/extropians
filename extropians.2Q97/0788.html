If 'the media' do not publish it when it DOES work, then it seems obvious<br>
that 'the media' could publish when it DOESN'T WORK.<br>
<p>
I know many people (mainly Discordians (hail Eris!)) who have got some<br>
great hoax articles published. Are you seriously saying you believe<br>
everything you read?<br>
<p>
Most journalists check their facts less vigorously than most scientists,<br>
the scientific literature is riddled with rubbish, imagine what crap us<br>
journos are feeding you. We have little peer reviewing, the public are the<br>
only ones who really check up on us, and most people on the street think<br>
"You think they'd publish that if it didn't work? I dunnOOooo......"<br>
