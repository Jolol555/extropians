<i>&gt; I think we all agree that genes are selfish and care about us only to</i><br>
<i>&gt; create more like them.</i><br>
<p>
It's a convenient device of language to think of it that way, but one<br>
must be careful not to take the idea too literally...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; One divergent opinion was weather a gene that codes for extra longevity</i><br>
<i>&gt; is good or evil? (in terms of reproductive success)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My opinion is that it is good. If one organism lives longer, it has a</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher chance to produce more offspring and therefore it is a good gene.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's as simple as that.</i><br>
<p>
...like that.  Good and bad only exist where there is an agent of<br>
conscious choice, and genes are not conscious.  Their "selfishness"<br>
is simply a way to describe the effect of replication in terms that<br>
make some phenomena easier to understand.  But the effect itself is<br>
merely an after-the-fact effect of whatever changes happen to occur.<br>
A gene can't judge ahead of time what would be good or bad; they<br>
simply are what they are, change when they change, and the ones left<br>
standing are here because they /were/ good for the environment in<br>
which they replicated.  In the case of most higher animals on Earth,<br>
the first ones probably had no use for death, but by chance, one<br>
happened to mutate into a form that died, and that one was more<br>
successful at reproducing than those who didn't /in the environment<br>
of that time/, because spending limited resources on older beings--<br>
perhaps with too many copying errors in their DNA or some other<br>
fitness problem--was more costly than simply killing them off and<br>
saving those resources for younger breeders.<br>
<p>
It is quite possible that a species similar to Homo Sapiens, but<br>
immortal, would be successful in today's environment.  But unless<br>
that mutation actually happens, and the two forms compete for<br>
a few millenia, there's no reason for it to happen.  "If it ain't<br>
broke, don't fix it" is a popular principle of evolution.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If, indeed, a gene that codes for extra longevity is an advantage, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't it present?</i><br>
<p>
Again, the point of view is backward.  The question is, since<br>
longevity isn't the current state of affairs, why was it selected<br>
against (if it ever existed in the first place)?<br>
