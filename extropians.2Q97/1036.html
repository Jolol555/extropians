Well, there's nothing showing it's harmful, to my knowledge, and I'd be a bit<br>
surprised if somebody did show it was harmful.  There have been a few animal<br>
studies showing that combining foods (protein and carbohydrate) doesn't<br>
affect digestion.  <br>
<p>
My take on this (and some similar issues, like ketotic diets) is that if<br>
people recommend major lifestyle changes without scientific backing, both<br>
past and planned, they are *dangerous*.  People like that are slaves to their<br>
memes, and uncontrolled memes can cause a lot of pain and suffering.  If you<br>
know somebody is seriously irrational about their life's work, why should you<br>
listen to *anything* they say?<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;food combining did have any merits, I think enzymes would make food combing</i><br>

<p>
Well, I swear by Beano, which is a fungal enzyme.  <br>
