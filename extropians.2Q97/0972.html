In a message dated 97-05-08 13:24:02 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt; &gt;The only thing better is a noncooked,, organic,</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;living foods diet.  I go for milk too though.  Proper food combining is a</i><br>
<i> &gt;&gt;must too, drink water before eating fruit before veggies before grains.</i><br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;You should check up on that.  I've yet to see any scientific references on</i><br>
<i> &gt;food combining.  </i><br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I did, in an excellent book called Fit for Life, written by a<br>
nutritionist/researcher.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;You know what the worst food combination is?  Meat and potatoes.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;chemicals in each cancel out the digestive chemicals in your stomach,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;becoming undigestibabl and rotting in your stomach and intestines for a day</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;like it was sitting in the hot sun.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is horsehockey.  The digestive chemicals in your stomach are</i><br>
<i>&gt;hydrochloric and butyric acid.  Neither meat nor potatoes (nor any other</i><br>
food<br>
<i>&gt;you'd eat) will cancel that.  </i><br>
<p>
Fit For Life explains how that process works, it has to do with acids and<br>
bases I believe.  All foods require a certain counterpart chemical in our<br>
bodies to complete the digestion, and some chemicals can cancel each other<br>
out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's a pity, really.  Calorie restriction is a great way to extend lifespan.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If all I had to do was to eat meat and potatoes together and nothing would</i><br>
<i>&gt;get digested, I'd be set.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, doing that would probably result in a hospital visit.  That<br>
combination releases tons of waste and harmful byproducts.<br>
