Sure, but its nearly impossible *not* to get enough fat from your<br>
diet. The amount of needed fat is a tiny fraction of the fat most<br>
people take in. Vegan diets do have fat in them -- plenty in fact --<br>
they just don't have it in the concentrated amounts found in meat or<br>
dairy products. This is not a bad thing, given how much fat most<br>
people overconsume.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Dairy fats are an example of this.  Calcium is poorly absorbed when</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is not mixed with small quantities of appropriate types of fat.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dairy fats are well-suited for this role (surprise!) which is one of</i><br>

<p>
Calcium is an interesting specific case. It turns out that most vegan<br>
diets contain much less calcium than non-vegan diets -- it also turns<br>
out that most vegans have substantially lower rates of osteoporosis<br>
than non-vegans. In fact, the highest levels of calcium intake in the<br>
world are among the Innuit, who consume an almost pure animal based<br>
diet -- and the Innuit are also notable for having the highest rates<br>
of osteoporosis in the world. Many Subsaharan African peoples have<br>
very low dietary calcium intake compared to westerners, and yet have<br>
very low rates of osteoporosis. In both cases, leaving one's<br>
traditional culture and consuming a different diet leads to a<br>
different rate of osteoporosis than among one's fellows living on the<br>
traditional ancestral diet. It therefore does not appear that this<br>
discrepancy is genetic in origin, but rather dietary.<br>
<p>
Why is this? The current best theory is that this is because<br>
metabolism of excess dietary protein requires calcium and ends up<br>
consuming it in the process. When you eat too much protein, it doesn't<br>
do your body any good -- the body does not store it beyond a certain<br>
point, and simply metabolizes it, turning into stored glycogen or<br>
fat. This metabolic process, as I mentioned, results in the use and<br>
excretion of calcium. Very high protein intake means a very high loss<br>
of calcium.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The "all fat is bad" meme is incorrect, or at least misleading.</i><br>
<p>
True enough, but as I said, you have no risk of consuming no fat in<br>
your diet -- you could not manage it without living on some<br>
synthetically constructed dietary program. Eating any normal vegan<br>
diet will cause you to encounter more than enough fat to live on. For<br>
the vast bulk of our country, the issue is consuming far too much fat<br>
-- not the almost unheard of case of consuming too little.<br>
