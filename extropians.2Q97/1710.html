Not quite.  The agent of evolution is the individual gene, not entire<br>
organism genomes.  Genes actually prefer to be in a bunch of different<br>
individuals so they don't have all their eggs in one basket, so to speak.<br>
 Too many copies, or even children, of the same individual can actually be<br>
bad in that they may all share some particular weakness.<br>
<p>
Probably, though, the primary reason for aging is that it's easier to make<br>
more copies than to make the copies last longer.<br>

No, nothing of the sort.  Technically, of course, genes don't "want" anything<br>
since they don't think.  However, since they have been very extensively<br>
selected for the ability to make copies of themselves, it's a useful<br>
shorthand to say they "want" to reproduce.  If the business of life<br>
eradicating itself had come up, genes would "want" to avoid it; but it never<br>
has, so there's been no selection on it, so the genes don't "care" about it. <br>
<p>
Many genes do encourage violent competition and do quite well by it.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The genes are really quite reasonable and want nothing more than to</i><br>
<i>&gt;see us thrive.  Really their main flaw is that they are a little</i><br>
<i>&gt;dense and they are from Missouri.  </i><br>
<p>
The genes "want" as many copies of themselves as possible, by whatever means<br>
possible.  And they are *incredibly* dense.  Insofar as they "think", it's<br>
over evolutionary timescales.<br>
<p>
Oh, and our genes are from Africa :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Once we show them that we are</i><br>
<i>&gt;what they have been working for all these many millions of years,</i><br>
<i>&gt;by eliminating aging, and not engaging in destructive competition</i><br>
<i>&gt;with other highly capable life forms when a constructive alternative </i><br>
<i>&gt;is available, I am sure they will be thrilled and trouble us only a </i><br>
<i>&gt;little. </i><br>
<p>
Actually if we get to that point, memes will be running the show and not<br>
genes.  The genes will just be tools at that point and considering them as<br>
self-interested agents won't give any useful information.  Genes can't be<br>
emotional, anyway, there's no sense in which they would be "thrilled".  They<br>
just act as if they had goals.<br>
