<p>
        I frequently hear complaints about Rand's apparent "inability" as a<br>
novelist and I can never understand quite why.  I can honestly say that I<br>
find "Atlas Shrugged" to be the best book that I have ever read (though "The<br>
Illuminatus! Trilogy," "Stranger in a Strange Land" and "Neverness" are<br>
quite close as well).  What exactly is it that people dislike about her<br>
writing style?  To me, the obvious passion she puts into the plot and<br>
character details is beautiful and very genuine --alright, I'll agree that<br>
there is a definate dichotomy between the "good guys" and the "bad guys,"<br>
but I think that that is only indicative of the strength of her philosophy.<br>
"TMIAHM" *is* a great book as well, but it is certainly focused a lot<br>
differently than "Atlas Shrugged."<br>
<p>
        A suggestion for anyone who is either repulsed or intimidated by<br>
"Atlas Shrugged" is to read "Anthem."  As well as being told beautifully<br>
(IMO of course) it is a tenth of the size of "Atlas Shrugged."  Probably<br>
some of the nicest words ever written (again, IMO) are in the book.<br>
<p>
        "I do not surrender my treasures, nor do I share them.  The fortune<br>
of my spirit is not to be blown into coins of brass and flung to<br>
the winds as alms for the pure of spirit.  I guard my treasures: my<br>
thought, my will, my freedom.  And the greatest of these is<br>
freedom."  (p. 95-96)<br>
<p>
        I don't know about others, but such words to me are the epitomy of<br>
beauty: the greatness of man's potential summed up in one hundred pages.<br>
It's worth a read.<br>
