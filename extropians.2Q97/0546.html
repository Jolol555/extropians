<p>
Heres how to unsubscribe:<br>
<p>
First, ask your Internet Provider to mail you an Unsubscribing Kit.<br>
Then follow these directions.<br>
<p>
The kit will most likely be the standard no-fault type. Depending on<br>
requirements, System A and/or System B can be used. When operating<br>
System A, depress lever and a plastic dalkron unsubscriber will be<br>
dispensed through the slot immediately underneath. When you have<br>
fastened the adhesive lip, attach connection marked by the large "X"<br>
outlet hose. Twist the silver- coloured ring one inch below the<br>
connection point until you feel it lock.<br>
<p>
The kit is now ready for use. The Cin-Eliminator is activated by the<br>
small switch on the lip. When securing, twist the ring back to its<br>
initial condition, so that the two orange lines meet. Disconnect.<br>
Place the dalkron unsubscriber in the vacuum receptacle to the rear.<br>
Activate by pressing the blue button.<br>
<p>
The controls for System B are located on the opposite side. The red<br>
release switch places the Cin-Eliminator into position; it can be<br>
adjusted manually up or down by pressing the blue manual release<br>
button. The opening is self- adjusting. To secure after use, press<br>
the green button, which simultaneously activates the evaporator and<br>
returns the Cin-Eliminator to its storage position.<br>
<p>
You may log off if the green exit light is on over the evaporator .<br>
If the red light is illuminated, one of the Cin-Eliminator<br>
requirements has not been properly implemented. Press the "List Guy"<br>
call button on the right of the evaporator . He will secure all<br>
facilities from his control panel.<br>
<p>
To use the Auto-Unsub, first undress and place all your clothes in<br>
the clothes rack. Put on the velcro slippers located in the cabinet<br>
immediately below. Enter the shower, taking the entire kit with you.<br>
On the control panel to your upper right upon entering you will see a<br>
"Shower seal" button. Press to activate. A green light will then be<br>
illuminated immediately below. On the intensity knob, select the<br>
desired setting. Now depress the Auto-Unsub activation lever. Bathe<br>
normally.<br>
<p>
The Auto-Unsub will automatically go off after three minutes unless<br>
you activate the "Manual off" override switch by flipping it up. When<br>
you are ready to leave, press the blue "Shower seal" release button.<br>
The door will open and you may leave. Please remove the velcro<br>
slippers and place them in their container.<br>
<p>
If you prefer the ultrasonic log-off mode, press the indicated blue<br>
button. When the twin panels open, pull forward by rings A &amp; B. The<br>
knob to the left, just below the blue light, has three settings, low,<br>
medium or high. For normal use, the medium setting is suggested.<br>
<p>
After these settings have been made, you can activate the device by<br>
switching to the "ON" position the clearly marked red switch. If<br>
during the unsubscribing operation, you wish to change the settings,<br>
place the "manual off" override switch in the "OFF" position. You may<br>
now make the change and repeat the cycle. When the green exit light<br>
goes on, you may log off and have lunch. Please close the door behind<br>
you.<br>
