Friday night I was listening to a Bio prof talk about the monkeys he<br>
uses in his research.  They are rugged and damn smart, and are trained<br>
to help run each new experiment.<br>
<p>
If any brand of AI researcher had a computer that good, they'd<br>
probably think they were very close to the holy grail.  But here we do<br>
have such computers, and we don't put them to much use besides<br>
studying their brains.<br>
<p>
So why is it exactly that we haven't trained such monkeys to do real<br>
jobs around in our society?  Couldn't they be trained to be security<br>
guards, to sweep streets, to wash cars, or to run machines in<br>
factories?  Yes language is important for many jobs, but for all jobs?<br>
Sure they like to be with each other, but couldn't teams of monkeys<br>
work together?<br>
<p>
I'm honestly puzzled here.<br>
