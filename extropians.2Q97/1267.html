The long term historical average for the major indices is 10% &lt; return &lt;<br>
11% depending on the index.  The indices are expected to perform very<br>
poorly in 5+/-2 years for a term of 5-10 years.  As I stated previously,<br>
the short-term growth of the indices is due in part to a demographic shift<br>
which is pumping a lot more money into the economy than would normally<br>
occur.  Index funds will probably be good investments for about two years<br>
or so.  After that I would consider investing in non-tracking funds.<br>
