Two, and it isn't entirely a question of "upgrading".  Even when the<br>
mailer I use on this cluster knows enough to recognize a MIME message<br>
there's generally no point.  Often I'm on a terminal, in which case I<br>
can't see anything special.  Sometimes I'm on an X console; then I'm<br>
asked permission to go into MIME mode.  If I say yes it spawns another<br>
xterm and displays the message in a small font.  Oh boy, the advance of<br>
technology.  Using bold or italics isn't exactly worth the effort.  And<br>
then I might want to save the text...<br>

Not that I'd call mush (ancestor of Zmail, I hear) a "browser".  Runs a<br>
lot faster, for one thing.<br>
<p>
This is a mailing list.  Use e-mail and e-mail programs.  HTML is nice,<br>
but more expensive.  Specifically running graphics programs is expensive<br>
in time and memory.  I prefer not to enter that realm unless there's<br>
reason to do so.  I will ignore people whose messages take more effort<br>
to read than they are worth.<br>

Holy Wood!...was that special sort of beautiful area which is only<br>
beautiful if you can leave after briefly admiring its beauty and go<br>
somewhere else where there are hot tubs and cold drinks.  Actually<br>
staying there for any length of time is a penance. -- _Moving Pictures_<br>
