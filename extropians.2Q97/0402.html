Children don't discount the future?  Children are aware there _is_ a<br>
future?  Ok, I'm exaggerating, but I haven't thought of them as having<br>
long lookahead.<br>

Hmm.  Are these asexuals in general, or immortal asexuals?  And does<br>
asexual meaning cloning oneself or designing your offspring?<br>
<p>
I find these papers very gratifying, since this result well matches my<br>
most common view of the future.  SF representation... at least partial<br>
matches are Culture Minds, the ship in Cherryh's _Voyager in Night_,<br>
Niven's Outsiders, the aliens of 2001, Babylon-5's First Ones, possibly<br>
DS9's changelings.  Patience and risk-aversion seem to be expected as<br>
consequences of immortality; asexuality comes because the writers shy<br>
away from attributing sexuality to such beings, and no one ever writes<br>
in terms of Bayesianism but low-emotion rationality seems to be the<br>
usual guess.  Curious survivalists.<br>
<p>
Hmm.  I wonder if I've gotten to the point where I think less of any<br>
extended-term SF which doesn't have such beings.<br>
<p>
I haven't been sure of the implications of "risk-averse": trying to wipe<br>
out all possible threats (Pak protector), hiding (Spathi), or preferring<br>
safe social conglomerations?<br>
<p>
I doubt humans will go extinct though.  Non-dominant yes.  Not extinct,<br>
not in a large and diverse universe.<br>
