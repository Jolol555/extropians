     Kudos to whoever was responsible/whatever took place for eliminating <br>
     the word static from the digest.  No more =20 and jagged formatting.  <br>
     It was very enjoyable to skim through the posts!  Was it on the <br>
     administrative end of this digest or is our IS person tinkering in the <br>
     wee hours accomplishing the little things that maybe no one would even <br>
     notice or appreciate?<br>
     <br>
     Happy Weekend all!  <br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
