Yes, it would be a good idea if such a list could be compiled, containing<br>
*reliable* information as opposed to all the anecdotal stuff, advertising and<br>
plain silliness out there in the infosphere; I want carefully tested<br>
information with references and good explanations. This is an entirely<br>
feasible project, although much of the information we really want is as yet<br>
unknown and untested. The nootropic testing project discussed a few weeks ago<br>
might be one way of getting slightly more information in an active way. <br>
<p>

<p>
I agree completely! Such a resource guide would be very useful, but <br>
requires some work to maintain and fill. We need somebody who could <br>
actually manage something like this, and a staff who edited and reviewed <br>
entries. A bit like the Omega database of Homo Excelsior, but directed <br>
towards actual tools. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sure, I want to be a cyborg, but right now, precisely what can science and technology </i><br>
<i>&gt; make me?</i><br>
<p>
I think the best tools so far are:<br>
	Mental techniques (improving intelligence, rationality, creativity, <br>
		emotion, memory etc)<br>
	Natural physical improvements (healthy food, exercise, martial arts)<br>
	Nootropics (some work in some ways)<br>
	Information management tools (wearable computers with cellular phone <br>
		modems, information agents, remembrance agents, decision support <br>
		programs, mindmap programs)<br>
	Life extension (calorie restriction, healthy food, cryonics)<br>
<p>
You don't want current implants, believe me (I'm studying implant technology<br>
for fun right now. BTW, as an exercise I will have to write an analysis/idea<br>
for a novel implant (ideally for medical use) based on today's capabilities:<br>
any ideas for an implant in need of development?).<br>
<p>
Being a cyborg is not a matter of having bionics or technology, it is a state<br>
of mind where you construct yourself, designing your life to fit your values. <br>
