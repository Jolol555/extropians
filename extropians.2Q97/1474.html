<i>&gt;Subject: Ideas Futures as a teaching aid</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I teach a high school economics class in a small independent school in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Southern California and I thought that you might be interested in how I</i><br>
<i>&gt;used the Ideas Future market in my economics class this spring. I had my</i><br>
<i>&gt;class compete in teams of four against each other for three months (they</i><br>
<i>&gt;already compete in a stock market game and a computer business game).</i><br>
<i>&gt;One player from each team registered and each team was required to make</i><br>
<i>&gt;a minimum amount of investments over the course of the game. The amount</i><br>
<i>&gt;required increased as the weeks went by. At the end each team had more</i><br>
<i>&gt;than $650. At first they seemed reluctant or intimidated by the game but</i><br>
<i>&gt;eventually all four teams were relatively active. On the day that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;designated for finishing the game, the winning team beat the second</i><br>
<i>&gt;place team by only 1 cent. It was incredibly close although they</i><br>
<i>&gt;invested in totally different things. Every one of the four teams</i><br>
<i>&gt;finished with a profit and a "score" of more than 1.000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I thought that it was a very valuable learning tool. The kids learned</i><br>
<i>&gt;something about trading in a futures market. They also explored many</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas about their own future. The were forced to consider and think</i><br>
<i>&gt;about how different their future will be. They now have the option of</i><br>
<i>&gt;continuing to trade in the game as they go off to college. I am sure</i><br>
<i>&gt;that some of them will do so. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For several years I have taught the fundamentals of both the futures</i><br>
<i>&gt;market and the options market and have spent some time attempting to</i><br>
<i>&gt;make these kids become "futurists" with mixed success. Your game did a</i><br>
<i>&gt;better job of accomplishing these tasks than I ever could. It is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;wonderful teaching tool. Our game was written up in our school</i><br>
<i>&gt;newsletter and created a lot of interest with parents and teachers</i><br>
<i>&gt;alike.</i><br>
