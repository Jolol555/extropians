Okay, but what about the scientists who find what they are looking for in<br>
nature? The ones who seem to actually 'create' the phenomenon?<br>
<p>
We are PART of nature, we grew out of it, we weren't placed here as<br>
objective observers by God. We grew out of that which we observe and we<br>
cannot separate the observer from the observed (except in thought and<br>
language).<br>
<p>
Proof of LSD causing chromozome damage has been both 'proved' and<br>
'disproved' by teams of researchers for and against the theraputic use of<br>
LSD.<br>
<p>
Also, light can be seen as particles or waves, depending on the observors<br>
assumptions, techniques, biases etc. etc.<br>
<p>
So which is the TRUE NATURE of light? Or is it true that there is no<br>
nature aside from the observed (and therefore created)?<br>
<p>
To paraphrase Heisenberg et al, to observe and study nature we need to<br>
isolate it, but to observe it we need to have interaction. The last link<br>
in the chain of observation will always be a human nervous system, which<br>
is not only full of quantum uncertainty but is also result forming in<br>
itself.<br>
<p>
<p>
just a few thoughts... I dunno.<br>
