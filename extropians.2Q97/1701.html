Pain and joy are also just variables in the uploader universe. In fact, <br>
careful management of one's emotional R&amp;P circuits should form a pretty <br>
formidable problem for the uploaders. Morphing knowledge into you can be <br>
arbitrarily slow, and can be associated with any kind of pleasure you like.<br>

Implanting designed knowledge modules (coco - common coding) into a messy<br>
GA-grown appears very very difficult. I guess a mature uploader will be a <br>
chimaeric, hybridic thing, made from brittleware logic blocks, and messy <br>
GA/ANN stuff. Capability of swapping blocks of experience/knowledge (memetic <br>
crossover/passing a piece of mind) more or less casually appears a <br>
worthwhile trait, intituitively. But obviously, us worrying about the <br>
properties of uploaders is mice talking about motivations and properties <br>
of the two-legged towering beings. Things will be vastly _different_ in <br>
uploader space. The longer I think about it, the more conservative <br>
pockets in the digital darwin universe appear nonviable. A fraction of <br>
uploaders will suddenly zoom off in a fast-forward development. As their <br>
activities, both in simulated, and physical space will appear <br>
incomprehensible to those left behind, they mind appear as random natural <br>
forces. <br>
<p>
I don't know how you feel about it, but I'd rather be a former, than the <br>
formed.<br>

Knowledge is a key factor of a future fitness function. The way you gain <br>
it are not really relevant.<br>

P.S. Concerning why death has not been optimized away by evolution: death <br>
is an integral part of darwinian evolution. Had it not been there right <br>
from the start, death would have emerged very soon. There will be lots of <br>
death in central zones of neomoravecian noosphere light cone.<br>
