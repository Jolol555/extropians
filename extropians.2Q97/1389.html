<i>&gt;   "If you expect Extropian investments to be motivated by</i><br>
altruism,you<br>
<i>&gt;      don't understand Extropianism very well."</i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      I could treat this statement as a "what's so" or as a personal </i><br>
<i>&gt;      judgment but I'll opt for the former, reminding you that in my </i><br>
<i>&gt;      original post, I was *asking* for understanding so, if the</i><br>
quote was a <br>
<i>&gt;      censure, it was redundant.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      I would expect no human concern to be completely altruistic. </i><br>
We've <br>
<i>&gt;      still got the survivalist trigger somewhere in our brain that</i><br>
keeps <br>
<i>&gt;      narcissism at the forefront of our consciousness.  However, if </i><br>
<i>&gt;      humanity were in a life raft adrift at sea, I'd hope that an</i><br>
Extropian <br>
<i>&gt;      would be the person most adept at navigating, protecting from</i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;      elements, and rationing the food and water.  S/he would be the</i><br>
leader <br>
<i>&gt;      that would better assure the survival of the group because of a </i><br>
<i>&gt;      natural tendency toward leadership, optimism and use of</i><br>
resources.  <br>
<p>
Leadership is not Altruism. Helping others is not Altruism. Charity is<br>
not Altruism. Altruism is self-sacrifice. Altruism would be if an<br>
Extropian were to stay on that sinking ship, to make room for humanity<br>
on that life raft. At the extreme, It is pressure to "Do the right<br>
thing for the good of society." Saving the world isnt any good to me<br>
if I'm not around to see it. Read "Atlas Shrugged". That's Altruism<br>
taken to the extreme.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      And yes, I think it's quite opportunistic to invest in</i><br>
something that <br>
<i>&gt;      makes money for you and is not benefiting and could be harmful</i><br>
to <br>
<i>&gt;      society.  I've drank gallons of it over my life probably, it</i><br>
goes <br>
<i>&gt;      great with pizza.  Now, I consider it a treat.  But many people</i><br>
guzzle <br>
<i>&gt;      it like water.  After the smoke has cleared and our society has</i><br>
agreed <br>
<i>&gt;      upon the scourge of smoking and it becomes the habit of only</i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;      weakest and feeble-minded, we will move our focus to the next</i><br>
and <br>
<i>&gt;      probably more important level in collective health</i><br>
consciousness: junk <br>
<i>&gt;      food.  There is a tie between what we eat as a culture and how</i><br>
we <br>
<i>&gt;      behave.  Garbage in, garbage out.</i><br>
<p>
Is coke bad? surely. Is diet coke bad? I feel so. Although I wont open<br>
the "Aspartame is bad" Jihad here. Does that make Coca-Cola a bad<br>
investment? I dont think so. Where does Social Responsibility become<br>
Altruism? Would I invest in "We sell crack to kids, Inc."? No way.<br>
R.J. Reynolds? Nope. Anheuser-Busch? Questionable, but maybe. From<br>
there it gets cloudy. How about McDonalds? They sell fat-laden burgers<br>
that are bad for you. Lamborghini? Their cars invite fast, unsafe<br>
driving. Mead? They cut down lots of trees to make paper. Maybelline?<br>
Animal testing. Viacom? They own MTV which plays Ganster Rap which is<br>
bad for kids. Wal-Mart? They sell firearms, and the aforementioned<br>
Coke, and beer, and cigarettes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Right now, the soft drink companies (as well as the tobacco)</i><br>
companies <br>
<i>&gt;      are establishing international markets with people who are</i><br>
delighted <br>
<i>&gt;      to have their products but are totally oblivious to the</i><br>
consequences, <br>
<i>&gt;      health wise and environment wise as well (can you imagine all</i><br>
of China <br>
<i>&gt;      with Coke with dispensed ice in plastic/paper cups?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      So, no, altruism need not be the primary goal of an Extropian</i><br>
way of <br>
<i>&gt;      thinking but it certainly should be pressing on the minds of</i><br>
those <br>
<i>&gt;      that are claiming a post human destiny and it should show up in</i><br>
their <br>
<i>&gt;      lifestyle.  You don't evolve just one part of your existence,</i><br>
you <br>
<i>&gt;      evolve the whole thing: mind, body and spirit.  If Extropians</i><br>
have no <br>
<i>&gt;      concern of the latter, it's an incomplete and imbalanced</i><br>
philosophy <br>
<i>&gt;      and I should continue my search for a more full-spectrumed</i><br>
approach to <br>
<i>&gt;      conscious, biological and social evolution.</i><br>
<p>
I wish you well in your search. I reject the concept of Spirit, if it<br>
was offered with a Religious or "Soul" or Karma definition. If, on the<br>
other hand, you use my definition of 'Spirit' which is the inherent<br>
inalienable power of a human being to choose and plot their own<br>
destiny, to make conscious and informed choices to seek out happiness,<br>
then I am more comfortable. Can I imagine China with coke in paper<br>
cups? Easier than I can tolerate a China being told, "We wont sell you<br>
this, we know what's good for you." You say altruism need not be a<br>
goal of extropianism. We must have different definitions. My<br>
definition, and I'd wager the definition used by most extropians, is<br>
the one offered up by Ayn Rand. Altruism is self-sacrifice. Altruism<br>
is bad. Charity? Social-conscious? perhaps. My comments above speak to<br>
this.<br>
<p>
The farthest I can distill the concept down, at least my<br>
interpretation of Extropianism and it's views on Objectivist<br>
philosophy, is that Man is his own end, and his own justification. I<br>
cannot and will not define myself against some altruistic, sociopathic<br>
ideal to which I cannot obtain.<br>
