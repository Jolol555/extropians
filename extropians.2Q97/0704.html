As is technology (aside from cellular telephones, which many of them seem<br>
to own; I've never seen such a concentration of cellphones as the time I<br>
visited a protest camp against one of the new roads here). Frankly, many<br>
of the Greens I've met just seem unable to operate in modern society and<br>
hence dream of a return to some kind of agrarian wonderland. Most of them<br>
are nice enough people but they're not very concerned with practicality,<br>
which is why I doubt that you can get them interested in libertarian<br>
ideas. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would very much appreciate getting a better understanding of how</i><br>

<p>
Easy; the public who want to 'protect' the land create a corporation which<br>
buys it and holds it for them. This already happens in some countries<br>
(e.g. the 'National Trust' in the UK which owns a lot of land and old<br>
buildings). Of course the Green objection to this would be that they're <br>
not into materialistic goals like making money, so they wouldn't be able <br>
to afford to buy it.<br>
<p>
However, some of the British Greens have used this tactic in the past to<br>
prevent development of woodlands; they bought the land and split it into<br>
thousands of plots which they sold off to individuals for a few pounds<br>
each. Then when the government wanted to buy the land to build on they had<br>
to at least try to hunt down every one of those people to buy up their<br>
little plot of land. AFAIK it delayed them for quite a while and was<br>
probably at least as effective as their more confrontational tactics. <br>
