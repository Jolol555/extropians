<i>&gt;      I've always thought a pretty good test of intelligence was to ask</i><br>

<i>&gt;      X until they can't think of anything else to do with it, except buy 50</i><br>

<i>&gt;      people on this list wouldn't have any trouble finding sensible ways to</i><br>
<i>&gt;      spend their first trillion dollars.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      My addition/clarification to that:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      First off, thanks Max for instilling a measure of vision and nobility</i><br>
<i>&gt;      into a topic and about which I started getting my ire up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      I would like to add that although the notion of "plenty" may be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;      non-issue for some extropians, it is not necessarily a measure of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;      person's worthiness or intellect that s/he settles for substantially</i><br>
<i>&gt;      less.  Rather, it is a limitation of his/her imagination and to that</i><br>
<i>&gt;      extent, those with loftier aspirations should graciously allow them to</i><br>
<i>&gt;      be or inspire them further.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Although I don't scrutinously follow Bill Gates' entrepreneurial or</i><br>
<i>&gt;      philanthropic efforts, it is hard not to regard him ultimately as</i><br>
<i>&gt;      short-sighted and somewhat facist, given the incredibly and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      precedent-setting resources he has amassed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Ah, another person angry that he's ahead in the game of dying with the<br>
most toys. I see it differently. It has taken his strict control of that<br>
much capital to make the impact Microsoft has had in our world, so<br>
anyone wanting to make a bigger dent in history, better get cracking.<br>
$35 billion still isn't much when you measure how much the government<br>
wastes every year. They've got a $2.5 trillion ANNUAL budget, while that<br>
$35 billion is his entire net worth, not his annual income. TO date,<br>
Bill Gates has had a greater positive impact on my life in the past 5<br>
years than the US gov't has had in the past 20. Who says capitalism<br>
doesn't do it better, cheaper?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      In Star Trek: First Contact, Picard and the 21st century character,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Lily have a discussion about the enormous cost of titanium to build a</i><br>
<i>&gt;      ship the size of the Enterprise.  It was so encouraging to hear Picard</i><br>
<i>&gt;      speak of a world to come that was not motivated by acquisition and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      self-centered pursuit, as if Gene Rodenberry (whom I regard as a late</i><br>
<i>&gt;      20th century H.G. Wells) continued to promote his philosophy beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the grave.  </i><br>
<p>
I always hated him for making the capitalist Ferrenghi such ugly<br>
dispicable characters, as if to purposely portray anyone with a profit<br>
motive as twisted and beneath contempt (at the time I was starting up my<br>
first business).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      If the definition of extropian includes continually pushing the limits</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of what it is to be human, where would considerations such as this</i><br>
<i>&gt;      factor in?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      I wonder if it would take a trillion dollars to make the Enterprise?</i><br>
<p>
Depends on whether Lockheed has made any progress on an Alcubierre type<br>
warp drive with the help of Haisch, Rueda, and Puthoff. Anyone heard<br>
anything?<br>
<p>
With the replicator technology, which transforms energy into matter and<br>
back in whatever complexity desired, cost of fabrication then would be<br>
much less than now. We couldn't do it today for $100 trillion. Being<br>
over 1000 feet long, we are talking about a spaceship at least twice the<br>
tonnage of our Enterprise class aircraft carriers, being built in space.<br>
We have yet to put even that much raw mass in orbit, never mind build a<br>
starship.<br>
