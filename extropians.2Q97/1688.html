Max More &lt;maxmore@primenet.com&gt; pursued:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How exactly do you think we will do that as uploads? It's not</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious that a change of platform will instantly make us totally</i><br>
<i>&gt; malleable or give us the ability easily to simply plug in new</i><br>
<i>&gt; abilities.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, I didn't mean to imply that our initial move to another<br>
platform would "instantly make us totally malleable".  Many have<br>
already brought up many important issues like the extreme complexity<br>
and integrated nature of our memories.  Of course complete<br>
understanding of all this would be required before we could start<br>
increasing our intelligence and finally being able to "plug in a PhD".<br>
<p>
	But, the only difference between someone before his PhD and<br>
after is only a material state change.  Currently we really have to<br>
struggle to make that amount of state change because of our inability<br>
to directly comprehend and directly manipulate the relevant brain<br>
matter.  Surely, some day, though admittedly likely a very difficult<br>
and complex process, we should be able to achieve such state changes<br>
much easier on a future platform.<br>
<p>
	I really like Anders comments:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What we will need to truly be able to transfer skills, memories and</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience is some kind of "neural lingua franca"; maybe add-on</i><br>
<i>&gt; lobes of our uploaded brains which are identical in all people and</i><br>
<i>&gt; information inside them hence can easily be transferred.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, I imagine an additional visual cortex, for example, being<br>
added.  Rather than receiving data from an additional set of eyes, the<br>
visual space being experienced in another visual cortex is simply<br>
being identically reproduced.  With such an enhancement we will<br>
probably discover that some people have inverted or different color<br>
qualia for representing various wavelengths of light.  I emagine<br>
generic lobes and cortexes being able to reproduce arbitrary<br>
sensations and ideas identically as others are experiencing them based<br>
on data from brain observers.  "wow, that isn't what salt tastes like<br>
to me!" some future enhanced person might say.<br>
<p>
	Evolution wired a very valuable joy to the chemical content of<br>
cheese cake.  But this particular pleasure is completely arbitrary.<br>
This is proved by synesthesia (miss wiring) where people taste things<br>
like shapes.  At first we may only be able to switch them off.  But<br>
surely, eventually, we will be able to completely rearchitect them at<br>
will.<br>
<p>
	Only when we can so choose and change what we want to want<br>
will we really be free.  Now, we are simply hard wired to want cheese<br>
cake by our creator.  Surely we will be able to eventually cut these<br>
puppet strings and become truly free.<br>
