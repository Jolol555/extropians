More to the point, belief in historical cycles may derive from<br>
apparent local patterns.  If you keep on fighting wars with Germans <br>
without one side thoroughly conquering the other, and every two<br>
generations or so, then hey, you've got an important cycle!  Ditto for<br>
the Germans fighting the French.  And the Russians, always being<br>
invaded, always freezing the invaders out eventually.<br>
<p>
Ooh, and China, always squabbling with those nomads.  Nomads come, get<br>
repelled or assimilated, and come again later.<br>
<p>
But the Roman legions wouldn't have seen any cycles.  They come, they<br>
conquer, they go conquer something else.  Then, much later, they <br>
collapse.  Britain doesn't have any interesting war cycles I can think<br>
of, and the US has been expanding and is young anyway.<br>
<p>
But these cycles aren't mystical.  For some reason the Germans and<br>
French never beat each other thoroughly, so could always face another<br>
around.  Russia's always in the way, but always too hard to subdue.<br>
Whatever China did with the current horse-riders didn't affect the stem<br>
population beyond China's borders, which could always send a new wave.<br>
So you could argue there are erratic cycles there, but you can also<br>
point to the mechanism, and why those mechanisms aren't functional now.<br>
<p>
And so with the _Fourth Turning_: you look at the evidence and the<br>
proposed mechanism, or vice versa, decide whether there's enough to<br>
argue about, and if so then argue about it.  Or you don't; my reading<br>
list is well stacked right now.<br>
<p>
Umm.  To recap my original point: belief by certain European historians<br>
in cycles may stem from perfectly explicable cyclical elements in local<br>
European history.  Observe local cycle, assume rest of the world behaves<br>
like Europe (or forget there is a world outside of Europe) and<br>
extrapolate that global behavior is cyclical.  Then convince silly<br>
American or Australian historians short on evidence and criticism.<br>

Of the Red Branch Knights and their ancient foe.<br>
In still of night the immortals fight<br>
But never the battle is won.<br>
