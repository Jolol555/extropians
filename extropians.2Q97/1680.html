It only sounds like a kludge if you have no wisdom. :)  "Primum non<br>
nocere" (first do no harm); don't fix it if it ain't broke; the 80-20<br>
rule; "if you don't understand it, don't rip it apart".<br>
<p>
Evo-bio is messy. Top-down design is hard. Leaving things out is risky<br>
(that is, there is identifiable risk associated with any editing process,<br>
especially *deletion*--and one of the big risks is deleting something you<br>
didn't understand).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Now I feel the main thing to be done is to understand the aging </i><br>
<i>&gt; brain, figure out how to keep it alive, and improve it's functioning.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a more conservative approach.  I see this as the number</i><br>
<i>&gt; one problem we face and until I really understand what is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; minimum requirement to solve the problem of brain aging I am not </i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to assume it will be easy or hard and I am not willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; skip ahead.</i><br>
<p>
My current emphasis is on trying to understand human group and power<br>
psychology, so I can make maximum impact on creating a world that<br>
1) I'd want to come back to and<br>
2) wouldn't mind bringing me back.<br>
<p>
I see that, not as the number one problem we face (there are a lot of<br>
number ones), but as the one where I can make the biggest difference. Our<br>
goals are parallel; a "rope" approach beats a "chain" approach if the path<br>
is uncertain.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; &gt; For me all of this is just conceptual for a while.  My</i><br>
own &gt; current idea is to do as much as I can to take advantage of the<br>
<i>&gt; technologies, skills, etc. currently available to keep me alive</i><br>
<i>&gt; and functioning at my best, and to help others do the same.</i><br>
<p>
Yeppers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think this makes sense for anyone who has not already done it</i><br>
<i>&gt; because I don't know how long the big stuff will take, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is comparatively easy (it lets me do something I can make</i><br>
<i>&gt; progress at in a time frame my mind can grasp), and it will help </i><br>
<i>&gt; me be more capable of progress on the big stuff when I get there.</i><br>
<p>
Double-plus affirmative. Do what you know how to do, then look at the<br>
problem again. :)<br>
