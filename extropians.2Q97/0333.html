No one's said much about what the stuff might be, or when, besides<br>
"soon", it might come out; and people are more likely to have other<br>
ideas if they've been thinking about the problem of list quality, which<br>
they would do less if some better solution to the perceived problem had<br>
been implemented.  There was a substantial delay between Robin's urging<br>
me to make my 'select' filter a public service and my doing so, partly<br>
because I was anticipating action from other channels.  Eventually I<br>
went ahead and did it.<br>
<p>
I'm not trying to cut anyone in all this, but it's been a while.<br>

What was the name you threw out, "NodeNet"?  I hope this isn't a<br>
Web-based thing, at least not for interaction.  I've worked with a<br>
complete Web-forum at Caltech, as well as things like Wired's Brain<br>
Tennis, and consider Web posting and retrieval to be completely<br>
inappropriate; it takes far too long and is too inconvenient when<br>
compared with e-mail, particularly for high volumes.<br>
<p>
Ah well, I can't really criticize something I don't know anything about,<br>
can I?<br>
