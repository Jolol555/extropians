 &lt;&lt; Wouldn't it be more extropian to not limit your interviews to those <br>

 ourselves to our current biological manifestations, so why require <br>
 their presence? &gt;&gt; <br>

Rather than impose any criticism onto this young lady regarding her <br>
methods of conducting her assignment, which probably have been <br>
established quite stringently by her undergraduate professor, I plan <br>
to use the opportunity to inspire a young writer to pursue subjects <br>
relating to science and technology in a positive manner.<br>

All of this may become moot, however, as my email message has been <br>
rejected by her ISP.<br>
