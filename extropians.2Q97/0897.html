Oh man, you did it. You made me laugh, which rarely occurs on this list.<br>
This is one of the funniest Libertarian explanations for inequality I've<br>
ever read.<br>
<p>
But to become serious again: Education _is_ a real problem. Not only<br>
education of the poor, but also education of those who are able to buy<br>
whole universities. Money means power, and in a world where some people<br>
are much richer than others, you will always have explicit power<br>
structures.<br>
<p>
Decisions of today are made by this power elite. This ain't the big bad<br>
government guys, it's those economic rulers, investment banks especially<br>
(Brown Brothers Harriman, Morgan Investment Trust). They own all the<br>
larger companies and, as if this wouldn't be enough, also manage them<br>
with their people sitting in the board of directors.<br>
<p>
They WANT government. Goverment is an easy way to get money (taxes) and<br>
to invest it the way they want. Government therefore doesn't only (or<br>
does hardly) do "clever" investments. Pushing weapons industry, for<br>
example, always helps big companies to grow bigger and to crush smaller<br>
companies, for it doesn't raise the life standard.<br>
<p>
Remove government and you get a dictatorship of banks / monopolies. Much<br>
worse than gov't could ever be. Freedom? You'll be so free, you'll want<br>
to buy a whole load of guns in order to defend yourself from street<br>
thugs. Equality? Raising life standard? Nope. But nobody who defends<br>
markets claims that -- that's natural selection. Eat or be eaten. Live<br>
and let die.<br>
<p>
Conclusion: Make those powerful guys cleverer, and they'll recognize<br>
that making the everone else cleverer, too, will be to their own benefit<br>
in the long term. That's all you need. No communism (any communist<br>
movement is crushed in its roots, whether by media propaganda or by<br>
weapons power), no free markets and no dictatorships (whereas these two<br>
are actually the same).<br>
<p>
I advocate efforts to help the poor. They'll never be enough to save the<br>
poor children, though. And anyone who puts this phrase in quotation<br>
marks should take a look. 12.5 million each year, have fun on your<br>
vacation. Poor, poor children -- they're just too stupid, or their<br>
parents are, or government is evil, or aliens have infiltrated them, or<br>
they've deserved it, or ...<br>
<p>
Anyway, I hope this isn't classified as "rant" again. I hope some of you<br>
think about what I say, or it is a waste of time. I don't want to insult<br>
anyone, I'm a peaceful guy. Maybe I just want the same thing you do:<br>
Make this world a better place. <br>
