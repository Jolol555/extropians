     Rick Knight commented:<br>
     <br>
     I wonder if the founding fathers in declaring the right of free<br>
     speech imagined multi-national companies with huge advertising<br>
     budgets<br>
     <br>
     John Clark replied:<br>
     Who cares, I don't usually listen to moral advice from slave owners.<br>
                  <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     I would be intrigued to hear how you maneuver through American society <br>
     without accepting their tenets, whether they originated with slave <br>
     owners, railroad tycoons, talk show hosts using sweat labor for their <br>
     K-mart clothing lines or poorly-dressed/coiffed facist CEOs impeding <br>
     the rapid expansion of information accessibility by buying up <br>
     electronic publishing rights and advocating a GUI operating system <br>
     that's not more than an elaborate virus &lt;G&gt;.  But I digress...<br>
          <br>
     John also outlined this impossible hoop for some altruistic and savvy <br>
     person to jump through (presumably in a rhetorical vein):        <br>
     <br>
     "I would be all in favor of government thought control to protect the <br>
     world from dangerous or erroneous ideas, provided you can prove to me <br>
     that this new ministry of truth would have the following 4 properties:<br>
       <br>
     1) A ministry of truth that can always tell truth from falsehood.<br>
      <br>
     2) A ministry of truth that can always tell when little people like me <br>
     and you can not handle the truth and so must be lied to.<br>
     <br>
     3) A ministry of truth staffed exclusively by saints so it always has <br>
     the moral courage to do the right thing and would never abuse its <br>
     awesome power.<br>
     <br>
     4) A ministry of truth that can magically enforce its edicts on <br>
     incorrect speech even in a world that contains strong encryption, <br>
     anonymous re-mailers, DC nets and a Internet that spans the globe.<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     Awful lot of pre-screening to assemble that group.  So, 100% accuracy <br>
     and assurance are necessary to invoke common sense legislation.  Well, <br>
     extroplate further, why stop evolution from impediment by ethical <br>
     considerations at all?  Of course, you'd have to put any humane <br>
     considerations aside when you began mass extermination of those who <br>
     aren't smart enough, willing enough or quick enough.  We could work <br>
     out the kinks as we go along though and save the questionably stupid <br>
     persons for last. &lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     I would concur with your consideration that it is a character flaw on <br>
     your part to speak erroneously and without compassion in such an <br>
     absolutist fashion about free speech. It's one of my big gripes about <br>
     the practice of libertarianism.  Taken to its extreme, there is just <br>
     efficiency and no feeling.  Don't go there.    <br>
                    <br>
     But I do like the fact that you know your history about the cliche of <br>
     yelling "fire" in a crowded theater (particularly providing the <br>
     lifespan of Mr. Holmes, relevant in that it gave me the context of a <br>
     seemingly intelligent man, myopically held back by the times in which <br>
     he lived).  In that context (see intriguing background in next <br>
     paragraph), it has a poignancy that would make one want to ongoingly <br>
     kick themselves in the ass.  Standing on it's own, it's still a dumb <br>
     thing to do it and a hazard to fellow citizens who would be likely to <br>
     reflexively respond for the sake of survival.  And I maintain that <br>
     free speech is not giving a multi-billion dollar liquor industry carte <br>
     blanche to advertise as they please.  Sorry, but I choose to devote <br>
     some measure of my effort to protecting the innocent AND the stupid, <br>
     whether it is regarded as wasted energy or not.      <br>
     <br>
     Intriguing background trivia:<br>
     <br>
     That cliche (yelling "fire" in a crowded theater) originally came from <br>
     the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes (1841-1935), he used it in <br>
     one of his decisions that upheld the conviction of a man imprisoned <br>
     for saying America should not be in the First World War. Years later <br>
     Holmes said it was the worst decision he made in his entire legal <br>
     career and he cringed whenever he heard somebody quoting his famous <br>
     saying.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     I'm a little bit fiesty because of a nasty commute this morning so <br>
     pardon the peppered and sardonic nature of this response.  I believe <br>
     John that you are likely a very intelligent person from the few posts <br>
     of yours I've read.  I'll continue to note signs of compassion however <br>
     practically applied.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
     Rick                                             <br>
