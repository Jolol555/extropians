<p>
No, but the newspapers are uncritical. The artificial brain (the "Soulsucker <br>
2000 Chip") was intended as a dramatic and humoristic ending of their <br>
talk, but some journalists thought it was reality, and then other <br>
journalists copied them, and so on. <br>

<i>&gt; 1999 : man-made blood and artificial pancreas will be available to</i><br>

<p>
The artificial pancreas is underway, and the email pager practically <br>
exists (it just has to become cheaper; think ubiquitious computing). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2007 : we will be carrying "personal health monitors" to warn us before we</i><br>
<i>&gt; become ill.</i><br>
<p>
Sounds hard to implement without direct access into the bloodstream - not<br>
entirely advisable but perhaps doable. I would implement it as a biosensor<br>
chip implanted beneath the skin on the left arm so that a combined<br>
clock/monitor could communicate with it and measure temperature, blood<br>
pressure and chemical balance. Not entirely reliable, but probably useful. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2010 : artificial cats and dogs will be introduced</i><br>
<i>&gt; The robot "cat" is already here and living in Pearson's kitchen.  "It would</i><br>
<i>&gt; not take much to add robotic legs and furry covering and replacing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; insides with a radio link to a pwerful computer.  The cat could then be</i><br>
<i>&gt; your personal butler, booking taxis, doing your home shopping and sorting</i><br>
<i>&gt; out your accounts."</i><br>
<p>
The household robot - it is always 20 years into the future, just like <br>
fusion. But agents are here, and seeing them as pets and animals rather <br>
than servants might be an useful metaphor. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2015 : a bionic man will artifical legs will be a reality</i><br>
<p>
Well, we can already make myoelectric legs. I assume that by 2015 they <br>
finally become useful if we can develop battery technology far enough <br>
(this is the current limiting factor - would you trust a leg that could <br>
give out after a few hours use?).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "because of advances in processing speed and memory storage, computers wil</i><br>
<i>&gt; be more intelligent and creative than man in 2015.  By 2025 we will be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to read what the brain is thinking and feed information into it to</i><br>
<i>&gt; supercede learning."</i><br>
<p>
Lot's of assumptions, but Hans Moravec agrees. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2020 : Property values become so high that complete underground cities are</i><br>
<i>&gt; constructed, serviced by computerised appliances that will recognise our</i><br>
<i>&gt; desires by body language.</i><br>
<p>
Underground cities are more expensive to build than skyscraper cities and <br>
arcologies. Devices reacting to body language are being researched today <br>
(affective computing, see the MIT Media Lab). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2030 : other artifical organs will be available such as lungs, kidneys,</i><br>
<i>&gt; liver and "senses"</i><br>
<p>
A conservative estimate. It is likely that at least the liver will be <br>
based on real cells, perhaps cloned or from animals. <br>
