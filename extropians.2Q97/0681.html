<i>&gt; won't run out of these metals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Remember, if it takes more searching and digging to get it, the recovery<br>
costs are going to be greater, thus the price will go up. However, two<br>
factors countered this basic rule:<br>
<p>
1) the Soviet Union collapsed. Now that communism is on the outs and<br>
Russia and its client republics are now nominally free markets, they've<br>
flooded the worlds markets with metals, gas and oil, commodities which<br>
are in greatest abundance and purity in ores only in that area<br>
previously off limits to western development and exploitation. So in<br>
effect, in 1990, the free worlds natural resources effectively doubled<br>
overnight, which would obviously lead to lower prices...<br>
<p>
2) Recycling. Once a commodity reaches a certain price level, and<br>
remaining natural sources become that much less pure, thus raising their<br>
cost of recovery, then recycling of those exiting supplies of<br>
commodities becomes an economically cost effective proposition. The big<br>
stubling block is that the cost of entry into a recycling supply engine<br>
is steep to begin with due to the political capital needed to be<br>
expended to change people's operating habits. Once this is attained<br>
however, the unitary cost of recycling drops as people's new habits make<br>
supplies of recycled commodities so abundant that demand for new<br>
commodity resources drops.<br>
<p>
Additional factors include all sorts of technological changes that<br>
reduce demands for various commodities. Fiber optics have reduced demand<br>
for copper, for example. The place to look for commodity price rises is<br>
in materials that have very little use today, but could become very<br>
useful with new technologies. Just look at the need for high purity<br>
silicon and gallium arsenide that the computer industry has spawned. 30<br>
years ago silicon, also known as sand, was among the most useless items<br>
around, except for nice beaches, traps on golf courses, and for use on<br>
winter roads...<br>
<i>&gt; The popular belief we ARE running out of basic minerals may spawn a new</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest in space travel/space engineering as we can get these from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; moon and/or asteroids, a good thing.</i><br>
