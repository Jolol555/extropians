<p>
But isn't it all a matter of where you decide to draw the boundary between<br>
mind and other?  What do you see the limbic system doing, processing input<br>
and turning it into emotion, or packaging input into a form that lets the<br>
brain turn it into emotion?  I don't really know much about the limbic<br>
system, so it may well be true that a lot of the necessary processing for<br>
emotion gets done there.<br>
<p>
I regect Gregory's arguement that emotion is non-cognitive, distinct from<br>
"thought".  I suspect that what Gregory is calling "cognition" is only the<br>
stuff that he is aware of, that sounds like language in his head, that<br>
seems coherent and algorithmic.  Cognition is really a matter of<br>
multitudinous processes acting on a wide variety data input, much of which<br>
never percolates up to what we call consciousness.  If vision is part of<br>
this process, there's no reason to think that emotion isn't.  Emotion is<br>
just one way the mind/brain chooses to represent and respond to some of the<br>
input it gets.  If we replicate the brain, I bet we replicate emotion.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I also bet that it's critical that an uploaded mind gets<br>
enough sensory input, and that it's of the right format.  If I were<br>
uploaded into something that replicated my brain, I wouldn't be worried<br>
that I couldn't feel emotions.  I would be more worried that I wouldn't<br>
have enough to "think" about to stay sane.  That's the nice thing all those<br>
nerves in the body and spinal column provides: lot's of information about<br>
the world.<br>
