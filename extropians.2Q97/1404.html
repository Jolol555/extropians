The Borg saga has taken a new twist with the season finale of the <br>
Star Trek Voyager series, in which the Borg encounter a species with <br>
extremely dense DNA that overwhelms their attempts at assimilation.  <br>
The Voyager crew is faced with making their way through Borg space <br>
and try to cut a deal with the Borg after they develop what they <br>
think is a method of fighting the biological hordes utilizing Borg <br>
technology.  There is an excellent explanation of Borg assimilation <br>
technique, as well.<br>
<p>
Of course, we won't find out what happens for several months, but it <br>
is interesting to see a storyline developed between two possible <br>
modes of projected evolution.<br>
<p>
