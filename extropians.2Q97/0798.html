"The Tao Is Silent" by Raymond Smullyan.  Smullyan is a mystic and <br>
<i>&gt; I don't agree with everything he says, but it's an absolutely wonderful</i><br>
and <br>
<i>&gt; brilliant book. Before I read Smullyan I thought that all mystics were</i><br>
fools,<br>
<i>&gt; now I know that is not true, only most of them. </i><br>

	John,  we have no idea how many mystics you have met, talked with, etc.<br>
and perhaps your statement about thinking "all mystics were fools,..." was<br>
made in light-hearted jest.  We have met many mystics and many people who<br>
claimed a belief in mysticism.  There is a great difference between both<br>
groups.  We found people from all walks of life, including scientists,<br>
doctors, lawyers, libertarians, Christians, Jews, Moslems, Hindi, Jains,<br>
Bhuddists, etc. who have had the mystical experience.  They share many of<br>
the values of Extros.  They see no need for the State or for organized<br>
religion and recognize that both are instruments of control of the<br>
individual.   Many mystics continue to go to their original place of<br>
worship and there they try to reach people using their own teachings as a<br>
springboard.   Lucifer, the well-known mystic, did the same thing in his<br>
travels through Persia, Afghanistan, Nepal and Kashmir; stopping to learn<br>
the "scriptures" of the natives and then teaching the mystical viewpoint<br>
which originated the religion.   He tried it with his own people but<br>
received a hostile response and returned to Kashmir. <br>
	Many people admired by Extros were mystics, including the father of the<br>
modern scientific method, Francis Bacon.  Michael Faraday, Isaac Newton,<br>
Thom. Jefferson, Thom. Paine, Benj. Franklin, Leonardo da Vinci, and Albert<br>
Einstein were also mystics.<br>
	Perhaps the problem lies with those who have a belief in mysticism, rather<br>
than a true mystic?<br>
	Believers, in mysticism or anything else, rarely stop to question their<br>
beliefs.<br>
Often we found believers who brought unconsidered ideas up and tried to<br>
attach them to mysticism.   Certainly we have found many books, claiming to<br>
be "mystical" or claiming to present "mystical" concepts, which were off<br>
the mark. <br>
	What do you say?<br>
