        Come now, Erik.  First of all, I must comment that you are speaking<br>
on the extropian list about a fundamental list ideal...a general faux pas.<br>
You are most certainly entitled to your own beliefs, but the tone in which<br>
you are conveying them appears to be one of condescension.<br>
<p>
        Second of all, if you are going to persist in ethical arguments,<br>
please back your posts up with some facts as well as opinion.  As the posts<br>
stand now, they seem to be more ranting and raving about personal thoughts<br>
than fact-based economical arguments.  Please consider what other people<br>
have to say, rather than charging ahead with set ethics.  Most of all, keep<br>
your mind open...no-one likes a cynic.<br>
