<i>        &gt;Where there exists a law, there must exist coercion, otherwise what         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is its point? And where there exists coercion, there exists something         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;doing the coercing. </i><br>
             <br>
<p>
A society without coercion is impossible, I would never be so foolish as to   <br>
say otherwise. After all, force is what private protection agencies (PPA's)  <br>
are all about, but it's in their own self interest to keep it at a minimum. <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why not just make an all encompassing contract (say, a Constitution)        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;which one may choose to sign or not. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
That would be fine, the trouble is I never signed it and have no desire to do <br>
so, yet they say I am bound by it and I am.  I don't have a death wish and <br>
the government has much bigger guns that I do so when they say give me your <br>
wallet, I do. <br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We can name an arbitrator (say, a Supreme Court) which will         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;interpret the terms of the contract. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you and I are in a conflict with each other and even if we both agree that <br>
we don't want the Supreme Court to be the final arbiter and we want somebody <br>
else, it doesn't matter, we're stuck with those bozos.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Anyone who signs the contract (we can call them "citizens") </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then I am not a citizen of any country, of course you will say that my heart <br>
is beating and that is my implicit signature.<br>
<p>
PPA's are not euphemisms for states because PPA's do not claim powers that <br>
individuals do not have. There are only 3 ways to get somebody to do something <br>
you want, love, trade, or force. I like to encourage the first two and keep <br>
force to a minimum. Everybody agrees that force is justified in self defense <br>
but government claims far more rights than that, more than any sane individual <br>
or corporation would dream of. If government needs money they take it, if I <br>
object to them stealing my property they will use force to get their booty, <br>
as much force as they need to, up to and including a bullet in my brain. <br>
They will NOT take "no" for an answer. If government needs labor to fight a<br>
war or be on a jury they feel justified in enslaving me until the task is <br>
accomplished. They'll make me an offer I can't refuse because I know that if <br>
I do armed men will come to my house and drag me away. I don't think <br>
government should not have more rights than individuals, but then of course, <br>
it wouldn't be a government.                                      <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;are also allowed to live in a certain geographical area </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You can join a PPA and live in any geographical area you want.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Anarchy in the traditional sense is an absence of government. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly, it is not the absence of law.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Just look at the world prior to WWI. Treat each country as an         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;individual person. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Treat horse manure as ice cream and you could have strawberries and ice cream, <br>
if you had some strawberries.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The history of international relations until WWI is a study in        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;anarchy. Accordingly, the history of humanity is the history of war         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;between nations in an anarchic  system. </i><br>
<p>
                                                               <br>
If there were no nations there would be no war between nations.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;While I see that it is anarchic, in some sense, to have all people        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;contracting singly with all others in order to protect themselves,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;how can this be desirable? You can't make a contract with every         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;single person you come into contact with. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Don't be foolish, nobody is saying make a separate contract with everybody on  <br>
earth, you just sign up with a PPA of your choice. The PPA makes contracts <br>
with other PPA's about what laws to follow and how arbitration is to be  <br>
handled. You won't have total freedom of choice about what laws you want to  <br>
live by and who you want to judge you, but you'd have a lot more choice than<br>
you have now.<br>
<p>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;What about fraud, duress, or unconscionability? </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Yes, those are problems unique to Anarchy, fraud and duress and <br>
unconscionability are impossible today. <br>
<p>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;It is similarly inane to attempt to treat each specifically. There         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;must some things that are just  "understood" as common to all and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;decent for all. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Obviously. If it was possible for law  to be completely spelled out like a  <br>
theorem in Geometry then there would be no need for courts or arbitrators, <br>
but it isn't so there is.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I point to the only example I can of true  anarchy -- the world at         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;any point before WWI. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
What about the Internet?<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the profit-motive is the final arbiter. In this situation, what does         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;one measure one's profit in? Not dollars or francs or rubles, because         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;a currency would require a large group contract which would "govern"         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;its value. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
"Money" is just something that is easy to transport, fungible, and a large <br>
number of people think is valuable. Exactly the same thing would be true in a <br>
world of Anarchy, except you would not be forced to use only the currency of <br>
the nation you were living in. If somebody tried to tax you by inflation, <br>
a great favorite among politicians today, you could just switch to a currency<br>
that was more stable.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What happens when a party declares his rubles to be worth more        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;than the contract stipulates? Send a PPA  after him? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I have no idea what that means.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;So then a weapons race among PPA's? Small tactical nukes built from         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the Anarchist's Cookbook? </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Today we don't have small tactical nukes, we have huge multi-megaton doomsday   <br>
H- bombs.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I foresee a very convoluted, and profitable weapons industry                </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
I don't know what you mean by "convoluted" but yes, I expect it would be about <br>
as profitable as the industry is now.        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;not exactly world peace, and a waste of valuable resources which </i><br>
<i>        &gt;might be used for more transhuman pursuits. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's true, a world without crime or war where everyone lived together in <br>
peace love and happiness would be better than anything I described, so would <br>
a world where the tooth fairy was real.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But in the U.S. republic, there's nothing one idiot can do in four         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;years that the next idiot can't undo in four  years. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It takes far less than 4 years to kill you dead as a door nail. Only about 25 <br>
years ago the U.S. republic forced millions of its citizens to leave their <br>
home and fight and often die in a idiotic war 12 thousand miles away that <br>
they didn't believe in. <br>
<p>
