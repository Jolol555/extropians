<p>
Very simple.  The atoms in the protein and the water attract and repel each<br>
other based on well-known calculations based on their distances, charges, and<br>
orbital arrangements from quantum mechanics.  Their movements are constrained<br>
by their covalent bonds, which are also well-understood.  The protein<br>
rearranges itself so the energy stored in all the various bonds and<br>
interactions is minimized.<br>

<p>
No, it won't.  The devil is in the details.  To simulate a protein in water,<br>
you need to simulate thousands of atoms in the protein and thousands more in<br>
the water.  The difficulty of the simulation goes up exponentially with the<br>
number of atoms.  The simulations could be programmed today, but the<br>
execution is still in our dreams.<br>
