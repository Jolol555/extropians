<i>&gt;If a beam of light is polarized at 0 degrees and you set your polarizer at</i><br>
<i>&gt;X degrees then the number of photons in the beam will be reduced by</i><br>
<i>&gt;[cos(X)]^2, for 45 degrees that is 50%. For an individual photon there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;50% chance it will make it through and a 50% chance it will not, if it does</i><br>
<i>&gt;make it through the amplitude has not been changed at all[...]</i><br>
<p>
Just want to point out that the 50% probability of the photon getting through<br>
is determined by something called a "probability amplitude," which (in<br>
this example) *is* (a complex number with an absolute value of) .707...<br>
<p>
I mean, the (okay, well, a) wierd thing to me is how the good old electrical<br>
ideas of amplitude and power are still there, with power being the square<br>
of the amplitude, only now power is likely number of (or chance of) photons<br>
and amplitude is this strange complex number that spreads out just like<br>
an electromagnetic wave, getting diffracted and reflected and refracted<br>
and interfering with itself...until it comes to some place where you *look*<br>
at it, at which point (and only at that point) you have to *square* it to<br>
get a probability.  Brr.<br>
<p>
I mean, like, power is the square of amplitude because voltage both<br>
pushes more electrons through a resistor and means each electron does<br>
more work.  But what's the equivalent of current and voltage for<br>
probability, you know what I'm sayin'?<br>
<p>
Of course it all makes "sense" if you look at it as a wavefunction within<br>
which (if you're so inclined) you can see a structure of branching universe<br>
histories, from within "most" of which life seems to obey rules of physics<br>
with some constrained chance thrown in...<br>
<p>
Anyhow, if reality is digital, how come it keeps splitting into branches<br>
at such an alarming rate, without getting any grainier-looking in the<br>
process?  I mean, with an infinite supply of bits you might as well be<br>
analog, if you know what I mean.<br>
