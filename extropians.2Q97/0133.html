Technically it poses little (well, uh... no unsurmountable ones) problems<br>
emplanting an bioinert electrode microgrid, juice either coming from a<br>
semiconductor laser, or a EM induction coil, hooking the output to an<br>
embedded, which in turn tunes into the datasphere via a cellular modem. <br>
While generating activity vectors at will should pose little problems (stuff<br>
is noisy, though), interpreting input will be darn hard, probably beyond<br>
the capacities of an average adult (albeit not of a small child). Imagine<br>
a headup video, accompanied with Earth magnetic field-, inertial<br>
navigation-/Earth gravitation-, and GPS input tracking, and a 3rd cursor <br>
you move around by simply willing it to move. Look, I just tweaked your nose <br>
virtually...<br>
 <br>
Augmented reality is fun. Can't wait till it hits the market.<br>

<i>&gt; the brain would become accustomed to nearly any form of communication</i><br>

<p>
In principle one could imagine an agglutinating, ideogram-based wireless<br>
cellular language, which directly invokes concepts/imagery (by poking the<br>
right representation systems, the Cyberlaputan). But even English is<br>
adequate for that. Otoh, i theory, one could activate representational<br>
systems upon reception of a token automagically, bypassing all protective<br>
filters. Say "bliss" and feel it (please don't try "agony". And never,<br>
never, never say "death", for it instantly triggers the cranial implant's<br>
lead azide charge (ack!!!)). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; voices, but rather impulses which are some language invennted ofr this</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose.</i><br>
<p>
You would still have to learn that language. CoCo, common code ("mo, didya<br>
grok that last _heavy_ syn-flood packet storm? -- Like wow, mo, me, I <br>
awoke in the gutter"). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; it is possible for people to "feel" fluctustions in energy fields around</i><br>
<i>&gt; other popele.  we interpret these as exhuded "moods" but they are not.  </i><br>
<p>
??? Not unless you are heavily augmented. Like SQUID arrays, to see EM <br>
activity, and nitrogen cooled imagers to pick up IR blackbody. ("Hey, your <br>
face suddenly shows much better circulation, it just turneed warmer by <br>
0.2 K... And the slomo replay shows that intersting twitching of the side <br>
of your mouth... Hmmm.").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; bees and seom animals are very clever at feeling these "moods".  Such</i><br>
<p>
Nothing but body chemistry, and interpreting subtle body language.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; signals can be pulsed at will as an alternative method of communication.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's not relaly light and not really magnetism, but something like it.</i><br>
<p>
Uh... I hope this "something" has any roots in measurable, physical reality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is too simple for us to notice, since we do not "need" it.</i><br>
<p>
Darwinian evolution has made us adept of tracking gaze direction, and<br>
interpreting subliminal body language and face mimics. Basic survial<br>
skills, in other words. It wouldn't have skipped a clue that crucial. So I<br>
gather it does not exist. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; One of the aspects of this which interests me most is its ramifications</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for the technomad and specifically for the technomad seeking an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; accreditated education. As universities begin to offer accreditated</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; degrees via the Web, students are no longer limited in where they exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The individual can participate from nearly any place in the world. With</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; direct neural access this is taken a step further. Nearly every</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; neurological stimulus could then be sent and retrieved, thus enabling a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; full spectrum of communication within the collective cybernetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consciousness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Bridging ethical boundaries for a moment. This technology might even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; enable an instructor to directly access a student's memory to ascertain</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; just what exactly the student has retained. Of course this is only a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; small part of education, and only one of many ways in which direct</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; neural interfacing could conceivably be used in education.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Explore and play! </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; -- </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; memory retention and education are different and a web-university could</i><br>
<i>&gt; frighteningly be sensitive to this.  The concept of "teachers" plugging</i><br>
<i>&gt; into student memory is too 1984-ish for me.  I think that such "education"</i><br>
<p>
It won't work anyway, relax. Microchanges in local synapse LTP are unique,<br>
and reading them remotely (ignoring the utterly trivial problem of their<br>
interpretation), is physically impossible (at least with that crude type<br>
of implant we are talking about). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; should foster nimbleness and differences of mind, and perhaps as</i><br>
<i>&gt; importantly it should facilitate communication not only among student and</i><br>
<i>&gt; teacher, but among students.  In a way, if communication were absolute,</i><br>
<i>&gt; there woudl be no class distinctions among teachers and students  Instead </i><br>
<i>&gt; there would be modal distinctions.</i><br>
