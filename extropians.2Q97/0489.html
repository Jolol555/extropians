I too can catch the mechanism. I was at the ballet recently and I was<br>
extremely tired. I kept falling half-asleep, and I closed my eyes as<br>
I prefer the music to the dancing (Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty).<br>
<p>
Everytime I came back to "normal" awareness I kept perceiving the stage as<br>
a movie screen and the dancers as merely 2 dimensional figures on that<br>
screen. I could almost feel my brain doing this and I could also gain some<br>
control over how I perceived it.<br>
<p>
I have only been to the ballet three times in my life, but I go to the<br>
cinema at least 4 times a month. It seems that in a confused hypnogogic<br>
(?) state my brain chose the most obvious (familiar) framework for the<br>
sensory stimulation it was receiving. If I were a ballet freak and only<br>
went to the cinema on a few occasions no doubt I would have seen Ralph<br>
Fiennes and Kirsten Scott Thomas doing a pas de deux, or maybe Woody Allen<br>
doing a few high kicks.<br>
<p>
<p>
I think these 'slips of the mind' are interesting because they can show us<br>
how our mind really works. Robert Anton Wilson was once walking in a well<br>
known gay district of SF. This fact was on his mind and he saw a sign for<br>
"All-Gay-Cleaners", the slip of the mind gave him an insight into what was<br>
on his mind at the time.<br>
<p>
Similarly, my ageing Grandmother only hears what she wants to hear and<br>
manages to ignore anything which might annoy of offend her.<br>
<p>
On a personal note my mind-slips have been very enlightening, I always try<br>
to find a cause for them and usually it is some deep-prejudice or anxiety.<br>
Perhaps 'mind-slip', like the Freudian-slip, is a good name after all.<br>
