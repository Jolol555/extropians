In a message dated 97-04-22 14:56:29 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; twice as much</i><br>
<i>&gt;  money is stolen from working families as is necessary for education,</i><br>
<p>
<p>
So simplistic. Half truth.Somewhat valid comment made less valid by<br>
oversimplifying relationships. Context dropped intentionally.<br>
 <br>
Some families likely feel this is stealing - and the compulsary nature of<br>
taxation does not work out for everyone. This is a valid point. Some find it<br>
acceptable, others not.<br>
Qualified in that light it *could* be fairly called stealing. <br>
But not if I agree to pay it willingly. And I would.<br>
<p>
However, among those who favor educational taxation, some agree that if it<br>
was spent better,  we would willingly pay for social institutions like<br>
schools, and would even spend *more* on education ( for the selfish reason of<br>
wanting a better, more  advanced society) - even some who do not have school<br>
aged children. The problem is far more complex, and in most debates,<br>
arguments abound as to where and how the money is misused and if private<br>
sector schools not controlled by and involving less govt. money would be<br>
better. <br>
Then we get into voluntary taxation, trusts, school bonds, vouchers, etc.<br>
