     Ken Wilber, in his book "A Brief History of Everything" has some <br>
     interesting notions.  Two of which I ran across last night that, <br>
     perhaps not so inadvertently, tie in with my posts on absolutes, <br>
     rationalism and new age folly from 6/5.<br>
     <br>
     "We can see the surface, but depth requires interpretation."  <br>
     <br>
     This is a suitable overlay for how we perceive reality.  There are <br>
     things we test and prove.  We cinch it and move on, having scaled <br>
     another "unknown" in our universe.  But it is the unknown that we must <br>
     struggle to apply meaning...and compelling meaning at that.  <br>
     Adjunctively to yesterday's observation to a flat earth, the horizon <br>
     was horizontal and ostensibly flat, so based on as much information as <br>
     was available, the world was flat.  (Cinched, now let's move on).<br>
     <br>
     "There is alas, a type of simple mind that believes only those things with <br>
     simple location actually exist, even though that belief itself does not <br>
     itself have simple location."<br>
     <br>
     I particularly like this quote because it identifies the paradox for those <br>
     who are sticklers for associating "valid" with "proven" and <br>
     "reality-based".<br>
     <br>
     Enjoyable book by the way.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
