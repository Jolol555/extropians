<i>&gt; Its interesting that the story implied that this new species are</i><br>
<i>&gt; ferocious fighters who live by an extremely Darwinian credo: "And the</i><br>
<i>&gt; weak shall perish." This would explain why their military technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt; have reached such a high level that they can take on and wipe out a Borg</i><br>
<i>&gt; Armada of 15 cubes with ease. That they originate from a thin stream of</i><br>
<i>&gt; space that is awash in "gravi-temporal disturbances" would imply the</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibility that they are an extremely advanced species from the far</i><br>
<i>&gt; future (which would explain the dense DNA, which would resist rediation</i><br>
<i>&gt; better than ours does) possibly near the opemga point. Their extreme</i><br>
<i>&gt; level of evolvement, and DNA radiation resistance together point to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this. </i><br>
<p>
	I was thinking parallel universe.  It would avoid a lot of paradoxes of<br>
time travel.  Both violate the laws of physic so either one is a valid<br>
choice.  They could be from an older parallel universe.  <br>
	The "gravi-temporal disturbances" could be there way of practicing<br>
intergalactic travel.  I seem to remember an episode of TNG were a crew<br>
member was made super smart by an alien probe.  He then proceeded to warp<br>
space-time, which caused gravitational distortions, to bring the ship<br>
instantly to the center of the galaxy to meet the senders of the probe<br>
(harmless, if non-corporeal, researchers).  <br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Working with the Borg serves a useful strategic interest, not only of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Voyager, but of the Federation. The Borg are apparently the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing impeding this new species advancement into Federation space. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; you help the Borg fight the new species, they will 1) be less likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; flee into Federation space, and 2)be more occupied with fighting the new</i><br>
<i>&gt; species than in fleeing, thus slowing the Borg expansion into Federation</i><br>
<i>&gt; space.</i><br>
<p>
I was wondering, is every single alien and alien ship going to be<br>
destroyed?  If even one was left the borg could assimilate it and they<br>
would be unstoppable.  Of course, the fact that the borg could not develop<br>
nanite warfare and a Federation computer (the holographic doctor) could<br>
shows a certain lack of ability to improvise.<br>
<p>
Also, in a previous voyager episode they documented (in a fashion) the<br>
evolution of the borg.  A borg ship became dysfunctional and the crew fled<br>
to a planet below.  They lost their connectivity and started to fight<br>
because they were species trained to hate each other.  One group (a<br>
commune) wanted to reestablish the collective because it would mean peace. <br>
They used coercive tactics to do so and succeeded.  They did not proceed to<br>
try and assimilate anyone but no one else was a threat.  The original<br>
commune thought that they were not only assuring their own existence but<br>
that they were also improving the condition of everyone on the planet. <br>
This mentality could easily be extended to all life forms.  <br>
<p>
I, like Anders, think the borg are a very interesting alien.  I also think<br>
they are a  great evolutionary step forward.  It may be that each and every<br>
individual in the collective thinks they are still an individual but with<br>
access to a great deal of resources and not residing in any one place. <br>
Therefore, the individual would be just as inclined to sacrifice himself as<br>
anyone else.  Of course, an individual with access to these resources might<br>
find himself gradually scrapping every part of him that was him before<br>
assimilation because it is no longer useful.  Bring on the borgs!<br>
