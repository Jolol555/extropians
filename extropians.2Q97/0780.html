      SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 29, 1997--Nanogen Inc. Tuesday<br>
announced that it has been awarded a U.S. patent covering key areas <br>
of its Automated Programmable Electronic Matrix (APEX) Technology.<br>
          U.S. Patent No. 5,605,662, titled ``Active Programmable <br>
Electronic Devices for Molecular Biological Analysis and Diagnostics,'' <br>
is the third U.S. patent issued to the company within the past 10 <br>
months.<br>
          ``This patent provides Nanogen with significant proprietary <br>
protection on our electronic microchip array technology,'' said <br>
Howard C. Birndorf, chairman and chief executive officer of Nanogen.<br>
          The patent, which expires on Feb. 25, 2017, was issued to <br>
co-inventors Michael J. Heller, Ph.D., chief technical officer and a<br>

applications on this invention have also been filed internationally.<br>
All rights to the patents have been assigned to Nanogen.<br>
          ``Our invention encompasses self-addressable microelectronic <br>
devices which can actively carry out and control multiplex reactions <br>
in microscopic formats,'' said Heller.<br>
          ``We are actively developing a series of products embodying this <br>
technology which will have applicability in a variety of areas, <br>
including the early detection and diagnosis of disease, genetic <br>
screening, molecular oncology, blood typing and screening, and <br>
biological research, as well as a number of other potential <br>
applications,'' added Tu.<br>
          Nanogen is a privately held company focused on the development of <br>
a broad-based diagnostic platform, which combines molecular genetics,<br>
microelectronics, lasers and nanotechnology.  The company currently <br>
employs 60 people at its corporate headquarters in San Diego.<br>
