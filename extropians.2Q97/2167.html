: &gt; As well informed about EVERYONE ELSE as about themselves?<br>
: &gt; Never mind rational ignorance, we've got a serious privacy problem here.<br>
:<br>
: Interesting how you placed my handle in quotes. A subtle dig -- or not<br>
: so?<br>
<p>
Just emphasizing that you are not the person of whom some of us think<br>
when we see the name.  (I've used various handles but I don't think I've<br>
ever adopted a famous name without change.)  Normally if I saw "Hagbard<br>
Celine writes..." I'd think I was reading something quoted in a certain<br>
work of fiction.<br>
<p>
: Ignorance, indeed.<br>
<p>
"Rational ignorance", for those who don't know, means a potential voter's<br>
choice not to become informed on a given issue, knowing that doing so<br>
will cost him more than his influence on the election is worth.<br>
<p>
: Privacy, Anton, is a thing of the past.<br>
:<br>
: [...]<br>
:<br>
: Anyway, about the issue of democracy. Can we agree that if everyone is<br>
: well-informed, the problems which Mark suggested dissipate?<br>
<p>
Sure, if by "well-informed" you mean:<br>
	. as informed of everyone else's activities, tastes and desires<br>
		as of their own;<br>
	. altruistic enough to spend most of the day remaining so;<br>
	. educated about Public Choice theory;<br>
(I may think of something else)<br>
