I am going to be travelling to the States in about a month and its a fairly<br>
long flight from Melbourne to LA (16.3 hours be precise) and wondering if<br>
any of you could recommend any recent good science books? The extropian<br>
reading list supplied when you join is good, but I've basically read all<br>
the books on the list and they are fairly old (though still good) and I am<br>
looking for something published in the last couple of years. If its out in<br>
paperback that would be a plus, hardbacks are particularly expensive here<br>
in Australia, but that's not essential. I saw Ed Regis's book<br>
Nanotechnology in the window the other day. Any opinions on that? Are there<br>
any good books that cover current work in genetics? I did a sub-major in<br>
genetics at university, but that was years ago and it would be good to get<br>
up to scratch a bit in this area.<br>
<p>
best,  patrick<br>
