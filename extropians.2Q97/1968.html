This little essay isn't finished yet, but some on these lists<br>
 may find it entertaining anyway.<br>

Me 'n' Joe and Those Crazy Little Cubes<br>

<p>
    It is often the case with inventions that two or more people come <br>
up with the <br>
same thing at the same time. This particular instance involves cubes <br>
that run <br>
around with each other.<br>
<p>
    In 1991 or so, I hit upon the idea of a nanoscale device made up of <br>
cubes or <br>
other kinds of space-filling polyhedra that are able to move with <br>
respect to one <br>
another. The initial design was a cube, one thousand atoms on a side. I <br>
thought up <br>
some of the devices and "Modes of Motion" these cells could execute at <br>
that time.<br>
    In 1992, when *Nanosystems* came out, I immediately snapped up a <br>
copy and <br>
did a preliminary skim. On page 416, Eric Drexler speaks of  assembling <br>
large <br>
objects out of building blocks, noting that "Blocks of sufficient size <br>
and <br>
complexity (e.g. containing a computer, motor, and actuators) could be <br>
made self-<br>
assembling, although at a substantial penalty in properties such as <br>
strength-to-<br>
density ratio." On the facing page (page 417), Figure 14.3 illustrates <br>
"Expansion <br>
of a eutatic environment....using sliding blocks..."<br>
   "So", I said to myself, "it appears this idea is already being <br>
pursued (as is the <br>
case with more than  90% of the stuff  I come up with), and I need not <br>
waste my <br>
time with it.", and went on to other things. I try not to 'get married' <br>
to my ideas.<br>
   The years passed, I conceived of other things nanotech, and in  <br>
November, 1995 <br>
decided to attend the Fourth Foresight Conference, specifically to <br>
determine <br>
which of these projects were dead issues, and which might be pursued <br>
further. I <br>
hadn't heard anything more about cubes or such in those years.<br>
   In the parking lot at the conference, I met and spoke with Jeff <br>
Soreff, and <br>
mentioned the little cubes. He told me he had recently heard of <br>
something similar, <br>
and promised to email a pointer, which he did. This put me in touch <br>
with Tihamer <br>
Toth-Fejel, editor of  *The Assembler*, whom had published an article <br>
on <br>
"Shape-Changing Robotic Cubes", by Joseph Michael [new website]. After <br>
some <br>
very encourging email exchanges with 'Tee', I decided that my ideas <br>
were still <br>
relevant, and significantly different from Michael's. I wrote up "The <br>
Construction <br>
and Utilization Space-Filling Polyhedra for Active Mesostructures" (Dec <br>
7, 1995), <br>
and posted it at my new website,<br>
<a href="http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb">http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb</a><br>
   Some central differences between the proposals involved the scale of <br>
the cubes, <br>
or "Active Cells", which I proposed be mesoscopic, atomically precise <br>
structures <br>
vs. Michael's macroscopic cubes, that they slide without detaching <br>
normally <br>
(Patent Pending), that the exterior surfaces have few or no moving <br>
parts, and that <br>
the faces be complimentary, rather than identical.<br>
   I was now in a polyhedral frame of mind again,  and also came up <br>
with a <br>
possible "Universal Assembler" based on the "Active Cell" concept in <br>
January, <br>
1996, and a type of interstellar space probe. <br>
