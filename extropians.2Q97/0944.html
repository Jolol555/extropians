<i>&gt; Even flaming would become useful - if everyone was really picky and</i><br>
<i>&gt; picked up on other people's E-Prime violations we would surely become</i><br>
<i>&gt; masters overnight.</i><br>
<p>
I think E-Prime fails to solve the problem, and even exacerbates it<br>
by making people think they can avoid fuzzy thinking by playing<br>
silly word-games with a broken language instead of doing actual work<br>
to think and communicate more clearly.<br>
<p>
The fact that our language evolved to give a central role to a<br>
certain device that makes muddy thinking easier is curious (note<br>
that "inspires curiosity" would be legal E-Prime but even more<br>
sloppy, and "is curious to me" is illegal but clearer).  Those<br>
that created English apparently /needed/ to think muddily, and<br>
it is /that/ which we should try to understand (I could reword<br>
that sentence without the "is", but it would have been less<br>
clear and no more meaningful).<br>
<p>
I'm all for language reform--I love Lojban, I created genderless<br>
pronouns for the Oceania Constitution, and I like to think I take<br>
some care to use my native tongue effectively.  I'm all for<br>
introducing people to ideas like E-Prime, but let's not rely on<br>
it as a substitute for actual rational thinking.<br>
