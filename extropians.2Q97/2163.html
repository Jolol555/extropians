     Scott Adams starts the chapter off with a seemingly random unsupported<br>
     slam against evolution, but then gets far wackier.  He starts talking <br>
     about psychic powers, luck as a commodity, and how repeating an <br>
     affirmation 15 times a day can alter the very nature of reality due to <br>
     new discoveries in quantum mechanics and multiple-universe theory.<br>
     <br>
     I think he should stick to lampooning corporations instead...<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     Why?  Did Scott hit a nerve by extolling something too etherial and <br>
     outlandish?  How dare the icon of the nerd community go out on such a <br>
     whacko limb as to envision the impossible or at least <br>
     yet-to-be-proven.  Bohm and Sheldrake have some very interesting <br>
     things to say about the effect of thought on reality, quantum <br>
     mechanics, morphogenic fields and the like.  It's not so easily <br>
     dismissable.  At least no more dismissable than Drexler if someone <br>
     wants to take a staunch pragmatic line.  Open up to possibility.  <br>
     Refer to Michael Lorrey's quotes on the absolutist statements made by <br>
     people in respected positions over the last century.  We live in <br>
     extraordinary times!<br>
