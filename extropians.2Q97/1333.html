<i>&gt;I wrote Friday that I thought it would be a bad idea to invest in a startup</i><br>
<i>&gt;doing R&amp;D towards Drexlerian nanotech.  At the time I was being completely</i><br>
<i>&gt;hypothetical.  However today I was browsing <a href="http://www.foresight.org">http://www.foresight.org</a>, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;I learned that exactly such a company started up last month!</i><br>
<p>
Actually, Jin von Ehr made an announcement last October<br>
at a Foresight meeting, and asked us to keep quiet for awhile.<br>
It was a thrilling thing to hear.<br>
What is new is an increased funding level. They intend to <br>
generate more publicity later this summer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Zyvex, at <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/">http://www.zyvex.com/</a>, is a Texas company whose mission is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;develop the first assembler.  They don't have a very clear timeline to when</i><br>
<i>&gt;they will achieve it, although I saw "5+ years" mentioned.</i><br>
<p>
They seem to be taking stock of possible routes and interim products.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;They aren't asking for funding on the page, but if anyone wants to ignore</i><br>
<i>&gt;my advice I'm sure you could contact the company and find out if there would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be any opportunities to participate in future funding rounds.</i><br>
<p>
This may be, perhaps an IPO sometime, although it is<br>
privately held at this time.<br>
