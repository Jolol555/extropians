Sure; you can define humans either as monkeys with very big and altered<br>
brains or as non-monkeys with a very long list of monkey-specific<br>
biochemistry, behaviour, and anatomy.  It's entirely up to you and both<br>
definitions are meaningful.  From a genetic point of view we're just another<br>
monkey, with no more genetic changes that any other monkey.  From a<br>
behavioral point of view we are very different, with most of the difference<br>
coming from the very slight genetic differences between us and chimpanzees.<br>
 If you look at our effects on the earth, at this point we virtually deserve<br>
our own kingdom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Well, perhaps not for the individual (depending on your definition).</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; sheep) the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ancestor species is nearly extinct.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I see... more is always better.  </i><br>
<p>
Not quite always.  But, as I said, from the *species* point of view more in<br>
this fashion is very good.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To anthropomorphize a bit, you would</i><br>
<i>&gt;rather be a chattel than a free being? </i><br>
<p>
Free, of course, but that's not the option here.  The "choice" for these<br>
species may well be extinction or domestication as pets/slaves (of course,<br>
insofar as a choice is being made, it's ours).  Mountain gorillas, for<br>
example, are down to about 500 individuals with a demanding habitat<br>
requirement.  In spite of being protected, if they aren't domesticated,<br>
between poachers, natural disasters, and the occaisional war they will<br>
probably soon be gone.<br>
<p>
Also, don't forget that monkeys and apes generally live in societies too.<br>
 From what I know about ape society, I think I'd rather be a pet in a human<br>
one.  Ape societies can be quite brutal.  I assume monkeys can as well.<br>
