<p>
Uh, so that you can see something on that movie you recorded? Yes, being<br>
able to squash my movies down to one byte per frame would be nice, but I'd<br>
rather have high quality pictures. In the last few weeks I've been copying<br>
a lot of the Hi8 footage I recorded while travelling and watching some of<br>
the VHS footage I recorded when I was a VIP at a couple of space shuttle<br>
launches years ago and wishing that we'd had a higher quality camera back<br>
then. The difference in detail is amazing (about twice the horizontal<br>
resolution and better color seperation). <br>

<i>&gt; Besides, IFS/ANN compression should beat MPEG (or wavelets, or...) by</i><br>

<i>&gt; expanding online. </i><br>
<p>
Which won't help video cameras much.<br>

<i>&gt; Personally, I think the "Amiga(tm)" is cursed. So don't buy it, ever.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Particularly, if approached in the street. Hey mo, Amiga Inc., just $50. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Deal?).</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, I have wondered why the Amiga nuts on the Net didn't just get<br>
together and buy the company. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Junk mail poses a sufficient problem on its own, it will be dealt with </i><br>
<i>&gt; by a mechanism, shortly. Authentication by crypto protocol, I guess. Nothing </i><br>
<i>&gt; less will serve.</i><br>
<p>
But as someone who's currently writing his own spambot to keep the crap<br>
out I don't see how this would work. I could easily block mail which<br>
wasn't signed by keys that I recognize, but then noone could mail me<br>
unless I already knew them. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Well, I tend to just ignore insane legislation. What, a law preventing me</i><br>
<i>&gt; from clicking on that link? Bull. I can click whatever thing I like. </i><br>
<p>
Sure, but when the Feds find you downloaded PGP from an American site, or<br>
the local cops come around and find 'child porn' or Neo-Nazi Holocaust<br>
Revisionist propaganda in your Netscape cache you'll be on your way to<br>
jail. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Fuck the law, then. Let that be problem of the Chinese (those behind the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Great China Firewall), or Arab countries.</i><br>
<p>
Am I wrong in thinking that Germany bans Holocaust Revisionist writings?<br>
What about Wolfenstein 3D? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Just now, yes. But a) not everybody is a pro b) CCD resolution will go up </i><br>
<i>&gt; in near future c) image processing and archival is a lot easier if no </i><br>
<i>&gt; scan necessary</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but image size also goes up with CCD resolution. I guess that a CD<br>
with full-size, high-quality JPEGs will be smaller than an equivalent<br>
number of 35mm films. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; I think the question is whether digital photography is suitable for the mass </i><br>
<i>&gt; market. What's "real"? </i><br>
<p>
'Real' is when I show some photos to a friend and they want to see more<br>
rather than get away as soon as possible ;-). <br>
