     I wonder if the founding fathers in declaring the right of free speech <br>
     imagined multi-national companies with huge advertising budgets, using <br>
     creative minds to find the most superficial yet entertaining methods <br>
     to make alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and eating junk food <br>
     glamorous, adult, familial, nutritious, etc..?  Somehow I doubt that <br>
     their vision stretched into our 20th century lifestyle.<br>
     <br>
     Free speech is not an oan all or nothing consideration in my book.  It <br>
     is leveraged by discernment and the discernment of the collective at <br>
     that.  And even then, if the decisions of the people are a result of a <br>
     smoke and mirrors deception by a charismatic leader (say...Hitler or <br>
     Kohmeni), is it true discernment?  (I've doubled back on myself...a <br>
     hazard of the overly-philosophical &lt;G&gt;).<br>
     <br>
     We tried prohibition in this country and that didn't work.  I wouldn't <br>
     vote to reinstate such government restriction and would in fact vote <br>
     for the legalization of marijuana.  BUT, I see why pot is not <br>
     legalized after what Corporate America has done with the liquor <br>
     industry.  Absolute Vodka ads are a stylized pop art form and cleverly <br>
     conceived at that.<br>
     <br>
     The only thing these ads are good for are their lampoon-ability.  <br>
     Recently, in California, the cowboy-like Marlboro men are now on a <br>
     billboard with one saying to the other, "Bob, I've got Emphysema."  <br>
     And there's plenty of suffering for the addicts to alcohol as well.  <br>
     <br>
     So, no, with alcohol consumption linked to so much dysfunction, death <br>
     and destruction, I don't really associate "free speech" with a <br>
     multi-billion dollar industry's ability to exercise it sensibly, with <br>
     conscience or any other motive than how much money they can make off <br>
     their product.<br>
     <br>
     Free speech to me is like freedom to walk in an urban area.  You're <br>
     safer from the large fast moving objects in the designated cross <br>
     walks, following a sense of order and cooperation.  And since most of <br>
     us are living in urban centers, perhaps we need to understand that <br>
     King George and monarchal threats no longer justify the absolutism we <br>
     apply, sometimes against the simplest common sense, to assure its <br>
     application.  Ostensibly, this is a trigger sentiment to some and I'm <br>
     willing to discuss ramifications I haven't considered in an <br>
     all/nothing application of the right to say what you want.  In most <br>
     things in a cooperative democracy, there are limits and not just <br>
     yelling "Fire" falsely in crowded theater.<br>
     <br>
     Cha-cha...er, ta-ta<br>
     <br>
