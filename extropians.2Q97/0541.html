Subject: DHEA, Alzheimer's Disease, and Depression<br>
<p>
<p>
In 1985, I predicted (copyrighted) that DHEA would be low in<br>
Alzheimer's disease and depression, and that it is the cause. The<br>
first report of low DHEA in AD was in 1989.  I just found the<br>
following report that further supports my hypotheses. <br>
<p>
Wolkowitz OM, et al., "Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatment of<br>
depression," Biol Psychiatry 41 (3): 311-318 (1997) <br>
<p>
"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate, DHEA-S, are plentiful<br>
adrenal steroid hormones that decrease with aging and may have<br>
significant neuropsychiatric effects. In this study, six middle-aged<br>
and elderly patients with major depression and low basal plasma DHEA<br>
and/or DHEA-S levels were openly administered DHEA (30-90 mg/d x 4<br>
weeks) in doses sufficient to achieve circulating plasma levels<br>
observed in younger healthy individuals. Depression ratings, as well<br>
as aspects of memory performance significantly improved. One<br>
treatment-resistant patient received extended treatment with DHEA for<br>
6 months: her depression ratings improved 48-72% and her semantic<br>
memory performance improved 63%. These measures returned to baseline<br>
after treatment ended. In both studies, improvements in depression<br>
ratings and memory performance were directly related to increases in<br>
plasma levels of DHEA and DHEA-S and to increases in their ratios with<br>
plasma cortisol levels. These preliminary data suggest DHEA may have<br>
antidepressant and promemory effects and should encourage double-blind<br>
trials in depressed patients." <br>
