<i>&gt;From time to time, efforts have been made to identify broad series of human</i><br>
behaviours and match them against climatic oscillations.  Between the world<br>
wars, two notable research efforts were undertaken by a geographer and a<br>
historian whose names are now altogether forgotten (unlike Spengler's, say,<br>
who is remembered even if nobody reads his books).  These studies<br>
emphasised the ethological impact of climatic variety on human groups<br>
living at distinctly different times and places.<br>
<p>
Ellsworth Huntington was an explorer, research associate at the Carnegie<br>
Institution, and Yale professor whose books ranged from Civilization and<br>
Climate (1915) to his magnum opus, Mainsprings of Civilization (1945),<br>
published two years before his death.  His thesis of strong climatic<br>
determinism strikes us today as crankily ethnocentric at best, for he<br>
sought to discover why `vigorous' peoples like wealthy Euro-Americans were<br>
so much more successful than the `indolent', `feminised' races nearer the<br>
equator or otherwise trapped and stultified by debilitating circumstances.<br>
In the era of the Asian Tigers on the Pacific Rim, not to mention the<br>
historic defeat of American military efforts by tropical Vietnamese, this<br>
claim is now obviously not just racist but ludicrous. =20<br>
<p>
We should not be entirely distracted, however, by our legitimate distaste<br>
for colonial premises and rhetoric.  A comprehensive current treatment of<br>
the coevolution of climate and life by Stephen H. Schneider and Randi<br>
Londer notes that `Huntington's views neglect the complex interactions<br>
among environmental and social factors influencing history.  They led to a<br>
backlash of social criticism, which perhaps overreacted by totally denying<br>
any significant component of climatic impact on human affairs.  In reality,<br>
though, most case studies reveal that climate and society are so<br>
intertwined that it is difficult to separate the societal impact from the<br>
climate factor.'<br>
<p>
Difficult, but perhaps not out of the question.  Huntington's comparative<br>
ethnography, usefully categorised, remains a rich trove of data on<br>
historical and environmental flows in the fortunes of nations. =20<br>
<p>
Raymond H. Wheeler, a former psychology professor at the University of<br>
Kansas, shared Huntington's interest in weather cycles, constructing his<br>
own grand theory of cultural recurrence.  Around the middle of the 20th<br>
century, Wheeler orchestrated a massive research project, drawing on up to<br>
two hundred co-workers, to reduce all of recorded history to coherent<br>
summary form.  As the data from 2500 years of records were tabulated, he<br>
discerned a number of recurrent patterns world-wide. =20<br>
<p>
The most notable was a roughly 100-year climatic cycle, varying between 70<br>
and 120 years, which seemed to fall into four predictable phases.  From<br>
this periodicity, and drawing on then-prevalent doctrines of cultural and<br>
ethnic character, he theorised a regular swing of mass psychological<br>
emphasis between `classical' or `centralist' and `romantic' or<br>
`individualist' styles of community and culture.<br>
<p>
Obviously these climate-driven distinctions cannot be found literally<br>
everywhere simultaneously, because a global shift like the El Ni=F1o<br>
vacillation will bring unusually abundant rain to one region while filching<br>
it from another.  Still, events like the Maunder sunspot Minimum during the<br>
17th century (coinciding with Europe's `Little Ice Age') suggest that at<br>
least some secular climatic variations on the order of a century can be due<br>
to changes in the sun's energy output.  And since available sunlight fuels<br>
all life on the planet, it also drives reproduction dynamics.<br>
<p>
Wheeler and his team found their data was usefully schematised by a<br>
four-fold sequence of roughly 25-year-long `seasons': Warm-Wet, Warm-Dry,<br>
Cold-Wet, and Cold-Dry.  Each contributed to a certain characteristic mode<br>
of collective behaviour, so that, according to cycle enthusiasts Edward<br>
Dewey and Og Mandino, `similar events have occurred throughout history<br>
during the same phases of the 100-year climate cycle'.=20<br>
<p>
As part of their project, Wheeler and his staff drew up comprehensive<br>
weighted lists of International War Battles and Civil War Battles.  These<br>
clustered according to climatic indices.  Drought and civil war recurred at<br>
approximately 170-year intervals, with a notable shorter cycle of<br>
approximately twenty-three years.=20<br>
<p>
Clearly, what's needed is a theoretical perspective able to bind together<br>
the empirical evidence for historical recurrences, and organise them into a<br>
schema of some robustness.  Although models of this kind have been<br>
academically unpopular for at least the last quarter century, or perhaps<br>
for the last fifty years, they are hardly new to historiography and social<br>
theory.  Aristotle's Politics posited six versions or perhaps phases of<br>
constitution: Monarchy (rule by the virtuous chieftain), Tyranny (its<br>
corrupt deviation), Aristocracy (the rule of `the best'), Oligarchy (its<br>
deviation, with the rich in command), Polity (representative democracy of<br>
the citizens), and Democracy (its deviation, mob rule). =20<br>
<p>
Polybius, in the second century BC, employed an `internalist' explanation<br>
for the decay of states: anacyclosis, the circular regime path from rule by<br>
kings, to aristocrats, to the citizenry, and back to kings.  Nearly two<br>
thousand years later, Giambattista Vico proposed a `New Science', or<br>
universal model for historical recurrence.  It followed a loop from an<br>
original bestial condition, through a rule of superstition (the age of the<br>
gods), to clan leadership and aristocracy (the age of heroes), and plebeian<br>
equality (the age of men) - perhaps culminating in a new regime of<br>
bestiality founded in new technologies.<br>
<p>
Perhaps the nearest non-Marxist contemporary scholarship comes to such<br>
templates is the `long cycle' advanced a decade ago by George Modelski and<br>
William R. Thompson, specialists in international relations.  This<br>
discipline is the theorised offspring of a somewhat exhausted older style,<br>
diplomatic history, formerly given over to an obsessional empiricism of<br>
daily events co-ordinated by doctrines such as Balance of Power.  Modelski,<br>
by refreshing contrast, merges the benefits of rich empirical research with<br>
a sociological account of group action, proposing a grand theory of<br>
political recurrences.  Its outcome proves to be not altogether unlike<br>
Wheeler's `externalist' climatic model, except that this schema is driven<br>
by `internal' motors: the fourfold systems-theory requirements of<br>
adaptation, goal attainment, integration, and latent pattern-maintenance. =<br>
=20<br>
<p>
Perhaps surprisingly, it yields a familiar portrait, only now on a global<br>
scale.  If Modelski is correct, since 1494 the world system has passed<br>
through five `long cycles', each with four generational phases.  The cycles<br>
run a little more than a century each, and climax in devastating contests<br>
for world leadership.  These global conflicts last between 23 and 31 years,<br>
with the same average as the cycle generation, 27 years.  We are now living<br>
through the exhausted stage of an American century, and, if no better and<br>
more humane means is devised for adjudicating leadership, the world is<br>
probably doomed to a new global war in perhaps 2030 (but not until then).<br>
<p>
Modelski's complex, tightly-argued claim for this parsing of the last<br>
half-millennium into repetitive centuries is by no means timid, and<br>
deserves to be cited at some length:<br>
<p>
	The long cycle of global politics is the major rhythm of the modern world;<br>
its mechanism is the regulatory process or negative feedback.  Other<br>
systems and sub-systems might have their own distinctive regularities and<br>
repetitions but the long cycle's is assuredly most visible, with its<br>
product, the succession of world powers, a glittering, if perhaps<br>
vainglorious, pageant.<br>
<p>
	As a rhythm the long cycle is not a merely mechanical process of<br>
regulation and control.  It is in fact more akin to a heartbeat, suggestive<br>
of the pulsations of a living, growing system, one capable of renewal, even<br>
self-correction, one that goes beyond the dimension of biological time into<br>
that of social time, the spacing of the social processes by the rites of<br>
passage of the world system.  The major event clusters of the cycle... make<br>
up the rituals of world politics.  They are the key markers of world time.<br>
(Long Cycles in World Politics) =20<br>
<p>
Modelski's narrative deals only with the global political system.<br>
Discursive regimes might well follow a more protracted pulse than the long<br>
cycle, but consistent with its punctuations.<br>
<p>
The regulation of world order, for Modelski, is a double feedback process<br>
blending stability and development.  While his version of grand theory<br>
inevitably stresses homeostasis - the systemic mechanism for keeping things<br>
on an even keel - it also makes learning a central theme.  Long cycles<br>
might track a common schema, but they do not return to the same place.<br>
Development and radical change are inevitable, especially technological<br>
change - the sheer accumulated amount of information and augmented human<br>
capacity to affect our world.<br>
<p>
The four phases of each long cycle switch between order and disorder.  In<br>
cycle phase 1, preference for order in the global system is high, but its<br>
availability is low; this generation wages global war.  In phase 2,<br>
preference for order remains high, and, due to the decisive close of the<br>
previous phase, available order is now high as well, leading to a regime of<br>
world order.  In phase 3, preference for order has fallen to low, despite<br>
its prevalent and perhaps oppressively high availability, so a regime of<br>
delegitimation sets in for a generation.  Finally, both preference for<br>
order and its availability are low, so deconcentration brings new hegemonic<br>
challenge to the boil -- preparing the way for a return to the start of the<br>
long cycle.  It is arresting to compare this schema with Wheeler's fourfold<br>
categorisation, where WARM/DRY matches Modelski's global war phase, and the<br>
remainder march in close agreement.<br>
<p>
Of course, the diplomatic long cycle schema was not developed to explain<br>
biological or even economic pacemakers such as climate. It emerges from<br>
study of the historical narrative, today usually regarded as radically<br>
contingent.  Yet while its roster of players is determined by sensitive<br>
dependence upon initial conditions - and hence to some considerable degree<br>
remains unpredictable - the general orbit envelope of the attractor (to<br>
borrow the terminology of chaos theory) is quite predictable. =20<br>
<p>
The major wars of these five great sequences are given as the Portuguese<br>
cycle, with its ceaseless Italian and Indian Ocean wars of 1494-1516; the<br>
Dutch cycle, with the Spanish-Dutch war of 1580-1609; the first British<br>
cycle, with the wars of Louis XIV, 1688-1713; the second British cycle,<br>
with the wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon, 1792-1815; and the<br>
American cycle, or wars with Germany, 1914-45. =20<br>
<p>
Interestingly, Modelski's late '80s attempt to forecast this pattern into<br>
the next millennium immediately went awry (along with almost everyone<br>
else's) by assuming that the principal challenger to American suzerainty in<br>
1973-2030 would be the Soviet Union.  Presumably the slot would be filled<br>
now by Japan, or perhaps Unified Europe, or the Asia-Pacific Tigers. =20<br>
<p>
Perhaps the most striking feature of this century-long process is the role<br>
played by massive conflict, or more exactly its successful conclusion, as a<br>
definitive time-marker.  Whether or not the long cycle is calibrated to<br>
more primitive pulses (physiologic, ecological, even solar), one can set<br>
its clock by the celebrations that mark global armistice. =20<br>
<p>
Arnold Toynbee famously found in this unhappy recurrence a key to<br>
alternations between war and peace: `the survivors of a generation that has<br>
been of military age during a bout of war will be shy, for the rest of<br>
their lives, of bringing a repetition of this tragic experience either upon<br>
themselves or their children' (A Study of History, Vol. IX). Perhaps the<br>
uniformity of experience shared by those children (in our own recent<br>
history, the `baby boomers') is at least as salient as that of their<br>
warrior parents.=20<br>
