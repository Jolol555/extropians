<p>
Real communities of people who regularly contract with each other have<br>
lots more mechanisms for coordinating expectations regarding<br>
unspecified contract details than just "learning to communicate openly<br>
and deal fairly".  Most such communities spend lots of effort to<br>
socialize new people into the shared community expectations, and often<br>
have lengthy discussions regarding proposed changes in common norms.<br>
<p>
It might help you to think in terms of multiple equilibria in a game<br>
in game theory.  In a game it is important to coordinate each player's<br>
expectations regarding what others will do with actual action choices.<br>
