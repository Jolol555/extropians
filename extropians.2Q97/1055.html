<i>&gt; So I would expect free areas which are subsidized like this to hew</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretty closely to average morality in what is allowed.  There would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; specialized places for people with particular interests, like nudists,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but that is no different from today's nudist camps and resorts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know whether nudism is becoming more popular.  </i><br>
<p>
	Our own experience with nudity, having a nude home, grounds and pool for<br>
our guests, is that as people get used to it, it becomes acceptable as<br>
"natural" and the connection with sex disappears.  In Europe, nudity is<br>
quite acceptable at the beaches, in ads on televison, etc.  Since most of<br>
the members of this list are living in that bastion of Puritan values, the<br>
Home of the Land, Free of the Brave, they are also plauged with the meme of<br>
"Nudity is bad, Nudity means sex."  In another 50 years, we expect that<br>
even this meme will die a "natural death".  Meanwhile, check out what<br>
attitudes you have about nudity and where did it come from?   Perhaps, with<br>
a little self-examination, you too will be free of this particular hang-up.<br>
