Who knows? it's probably just a natural phenomena of some sort, but I must <br>
admit when I first heard of it I thought of Robin Hanson's essay "The Great <br>
Filter". This is almost certainly bullshit, but suppose, just suppose nature <br>
was unkind, suppose in the technological history of any civilization there <br>
will come a time when it will find hints of a new force in nature, and suppose <br>
there was a very obvious experiment to investigate this possibility, and <br>
suppose they had not one scrap of information to think it was in any way <br>
dangerous. And then BOOM.<br>
<p>
It is of course difficult to predict how a newly discovered force in Physics <br>
will react, that's why it's new. Madam Curie was certainly not stupid, and <br>
she had not one scrap of information to think that the strange rays given off <br>
by Radium were in any way dangerous, but it killed her.<br>
<p>
If the Gamma Ray Bursters are the product of intelligence, it looks more like <br>
a horrible miscalculation than a energy project to me. I very much doubt that <br>
the signature of an advanced civilization would be anything super hot like <br>
Gamma Rays, because that would be very inefficient. I think that waste heat<br>
would probably be in the infra red, just a little above the 3 degree <br>
background black body radiation.<br>
