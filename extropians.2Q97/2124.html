[I accidentally sent this to the filtered list instead of the main list.  My<br>
apologies to those on the filtered list who are now seeing it twice.]<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; This has been posted to the technocracy list, as a reply to my request</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; regarding the goals of technocracy.  Could somebody please comment on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; these guys' approach validity? I know that the loss of jobs due to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; automation problem is real, probably forcing us to do some (discriminate!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wealth redistribution over long. However, I somehow fail to see how below</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; approach should solve any problems at all...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; |karpal|</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I get worried when someone tells me of a magic scheme to solve all of </i><br>
<i>&gt;our problems, that involves the citizenry rising up, and imposing it</i><br>
<i>&gt;on everyone.</i><br>
<p>
Technocracy was invented back in the '30s.  It was yet another mass movement<br>
to reform the society and economy along rational, centralized lines, just<br>
like Fascism and Communism.  Unfortunately, it never got very massive, which<br>
is fatal for a mass movement.  I'm amazed it's still around.  <br>
<p>
I had imagined it fading away in the '60s, chapter meetings in<br>
air-conditioned brand-new LA living rooms, each attracting fewer members<br>
than the one before, until the last Technocrat packs up all the handbills,<br>
manfestos and meeting minutes into an old Electrolux box and stashes them in<br>
the attic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I know I'm putting this in simple terms, but Technocracy's goal is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; help implement this DESIGN which was developed by 300 top researchers</i><br>
<i>&gt; who took INVENTORY of North America's resources and minerals to see if</i><br>
<i>&gt; we could support our INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION which tends to gobble up</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources much faster than the 19th century hand-tool pace.</i><br>
<p>
Once you realize Technocracy is an ideology of the 1930s, this paragraph<br>
makes sense (as rhetoric, anyway).  Of course they think natural resources<br>
are important.  Of course they trust teams of top researchers.  Of course<br>
they compare themselves to the 19th century.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact is that KWTS changed forever the way people and machines WORK --</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet we're still attempting to price everything as if we're all still on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the farms and making stuff by hand -- which we aren't.</i><br>
<p>
Now in the 1930s, this would have made some sense.  Back then, lots of<br>
people had moved off the farms and into factories, gone from hand tools to<br>
machine tools, within living memory.  But nowadays?  Most Americans have<br>
lived in the suburbs amd used power tools for two generations.  And<br>
electricity-- the magic KWT-- is no longer the glorious wave of the future,<br>
that will restructure society in its image.  Nowadays it's the magic MBAUD,<br>
but that's a rant for another day.<br>
<p>
I am struck by the melancholy image of the last Extropian, in 2060 or so,<br>
trying to get the point across to a world which has moved on.  Let's hope we<br>
do better than technocracy.  <br>

PS. The word 'technocrat' was reappropriated lately, primarily by the<br>
magazine Economist, to refer to a dispassionate and number-oriented style of<br>
economic/political management.  Suharto and Steven Forbes are both<br>
technocrats in this sense.<br>
