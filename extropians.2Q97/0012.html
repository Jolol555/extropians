The Dutch, Venetians, and Swiss all have had semi-republican governments<br>
for a long time, or at least had aberrant relations with feudalism.  The<br>
Netherlands and Venice are swamplands -- poor or even nonexistent land<br>
(dikes) and bad areas for heavy chivalry (glug glug).  Swiss mountain<br>
valleys are hard to attack as well.  The Appalachians are said to be<br>
somewhat reclusively independent, certainly from "revenooers", but are<br>
dirt poor, unlike the three afore-mentioned republics.<br>

Property tax.  Poll tax.  Visible wealth tax -- most people won't find<br>

Holy Wood!...was that special sort of beautiful area which is only<br>
beautiful if you can leave after briefly admiring its beauty and go<br>
somewhere else where there are hot tubs and cold drinks.  Actually<br>
staying there for any length of time is a penance. -- _Moving Pictures_<br>
