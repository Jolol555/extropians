While I would very much like to participate on this thread, I have a <br>
request/suggestion prior to doing so:  Could we drop the notion of <br>
ranking our research questions as more or less important?  I have <br>
seen far too many debates on both transhumanist lists over whose work <br>
will impact evolution more, and it tends to devolve into personal <br>
arguments.<br>
<p>
We each possess our own visions of the directions in which humanity <br>
will evolve, and I personally think that everyone's work is vitally <br>
important in the expansion of our abilities and endeavors.  I also <br>
project that, because choice has entered as a determining factor, humans <br>
will actually multi-track onto different paths of expansion and <br>
transformation, maybe even to the point of developing into different <br>
sets of species altogether.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
