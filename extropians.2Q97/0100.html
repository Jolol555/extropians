Yes.  Presumably the "price" of such activities will rise, inducing<br>
more "supply".  But which sex will supply first?  My guess is that men<br>
are more likely to realize how much they value these traits in women,<br>
inducing more women to supply these traits, than women are likely to<br>
value these traits in men, inducing men to supply them more.  I wish I<br>
were wrong though.<br>

Yes its complex, but the time to bring expectations and actions into<br>
equilibrium depends on the mechanisms of information transmission.  If<br>
each person just makes a private guess, and then waits a generation to<br>
see the results, it could take a while.  It should help to have more<br>
of a conversation about what we want and expect.  So I am dissapointed<br>
that there seems to be little conversation on these topics.  <br>
