John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; continued:<br>

<i>&gt; You're being much too serious, Dennett was just having some fun and</i><br>
<i>&gt; engaging in a little wordplay, like saying "you don't think, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; just think you think".</i><br>
<p>
	It seemed much more like a critical piece of his argument in<br>
his book Consciousness Explained to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The "moon theory" explains lots of things, things, like RADAR</i><br>
<i>&gt; reflected off its surface, the tides, the chemical analysis of</i><br>
<i>&gt; rocks, and photons entering our eye. The only thing the "conscious</i><br>
<i>&gt; minds other than me" theory explains is behavior, if as you say it</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't even do that then it's useless and logically I'd have to take</i><br>
<i>&gt; solipsism very seriously.</i><br>
<p>
	There are lots of things having phenomenal representations<br>
explains also.  And this, with our current lack of understanding and<br>
lack of ability to objectively manipulate and observe it.  When we can<br>
finally get our intelligence around observing much larger sub sets of<br>
neurons in our brain there will be lots more physical things it will<br>
explain.  When we can predict that YOU will feel what you feel when a<br>
certain set of brain, in a certain state, performs a particular way<br>
and so on it will explain all this also.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you keep asking a sequence of "why" questions, before very many</i><br>
<i>&gt; steps you will come to a ontological primitive that no theory can</i><br>
<i>&gt; answer, such as, "Why is there something rather than nothing?"</i><br>
<p>
	Precisely!  But there is something.  Without something to<br>
represent information there is no information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; or "Why does intelligence produce consciousness?". The only answer</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that's just the way the Universe is.</i><br>
<p>
	No, intelligence doesn't really produce consciousness.  Our<br>
brain uses conscious stuff to represent information with.  If such<br>
phenomenal physical stuff or phenomenon didn't exist or wasn't<br>
possible in our universe, our brain might have used something else to<br>
represent the information required to produce intelligence.  I'm sure<br>
some animals and insects aren't conscious like we are.  Nature uses<br>
some qualia for some intelligences and likely different qualia for<br>
different intelligences.  And maybe just abstract representations in<br>
very low, computer like, bug creatures.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I said INTELLIGENT zombies. I have to see an intelligent computer,</i><br>
<i>&gt; color sensing or not, when I do I will conclude it's conscious.</i><br>
<p>
	There are machines now that can pass, at least limited,<br>
Turring tests.  Soon they will be completely unlimited and<br>
indistinguishable.  What would you think of these computers when they<br>
try to answer the question: "What is blue like?"  A computer may have<br>
a pre prepaired script of abstract text to answer such a question but<br>
this is completely different to what we do when we try to answer such<br>
questions.  Imagine how you would act if you were trying to convince<br>
someone you used a red and blue qualia to represent 700 and 500 nm<br>
light inversely from me.  You could try it but you might be lying.  A<br>
machine trying to convince you it knew what blue was like would be<br>
absolutely lying.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My present consciousness was also influenced by the experiences I</i><br>
<i>&gt; had in my life up to now, and every bit of it came to me through my</i><br>
<i>&gt; senses and they can be represented digitally also.</i><br>
<p>
	No.  When you see light reflecting off of a red surface, this<br>
information about the wavelength of light is abstractly represented by<br>
firing neurons.  These firing neurons, in turn, produce a red<br>
sensation in your brain.  This red abstractly represents the way<br>
particular wavelengths of light reflect off of the particular surface.<br>
Though the two things are abstractly like each other or model each<br>
other they are fundamentally not like each other at all.  We know that<br>
neural firing is not physically anything like light reflecting off of<br>
a surface.  We simply abstractly know that if we feel a red sensation<br>
then 700 nm light is being reflected.  Knowing this doesn't imply that<br>
the two phenomenon are anything like each other.  The actual nature of<br>
the red quale, or what it is like, did not come to you through your<br>
senses.  Your brain simply used these phenomenal qualities to<br>
represent the abstract information it was getting about the world.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Science can find no difference between one atom and another,</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, and it is my bet that science will not be able to<br>
distinguish between me experiencing a red quali and you experience a<br>
red quale.  Although you may use one quale to represent 700 nm light<br>
and I may use that particular one to represent 500 nm light.  We may<br>
call these different representations red but they are not subjectively<br>
the same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The important thing is the way the matter is organized and the name</i><br>
<i>&gt; for that is information.</i><br>
<p>
	But there is more than just this!  Though 700 nm light and a<br>
red quale can represent the same information what they are<br>
fundamentally and phenomenally like is also important.  You can tell<br>
the difference between light and firing neurons.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If we have ever "looked" we must have used senses to do so.</i><br>
<p>
	I know that the sensation I get from looking at a fire red<br>
mustang is very different from what I experience when I try to<br>
remember that red.  With my eyes closed I can't normally experience<br>
this red sensation, unless I am dreaming.  I know the difference<br>
between these two representations and I did not find out this<br>
difference information from my senses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I did know what it's like to be you then I'd be you.</i><br>
<p>
	Some day you will be able to configure a part of your brain to<br>
reproduce the same conscious phenomenon that is going on in my brain<br>
because of our scientific physical understanding of the processes that<br>
we will discover.  You will then know precisely what it is like for me<br>
to experience something.  As I said earlier, you may discover that I<br>
represent salt with an entirely different quale than what you<br>
represent the taste of salt with.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is no point dancing around it, what we're talking about is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; soul.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes.  The soul is particular set of physical stuff that<br>
produces a particular set of conscious phenomenon to represent itself.<br>
The information describing which particular stuff and the organization<br>
of this stuff is us.  But, just as important is the fundamental and<br>
phenomenal natures of this stuff is the answer to the question: what<br>
is this stuff like?  You can abstractly represent a red sensation with<br>
700 nm light but this light tells you nothing about what red is really<br>
like.  You can abstractly represent any part of information about what<br>
this stuff is like with different stuff, but it will be just that:<br>
different fundamental physical stuff or phenomenon.  What is<br>
representing abstract information and what it is like is important also.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4) The soul is immortal and so, potentially, is information.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, if you take the proper fundamental physical stuff and<br>
phenomenon and put it in the same operating state, it will eternally<br>
be you or indistinguishable from you.  But, if you use different stuff<br>
to represent or model the same information or process, though it may<br>
abstractly model you, it will be fundamentally different and<br>
distinguishable from you.  The information is important but the nature<br>
of the particular stuff and what it is like is also important for<br>
consciousness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 1) The soul can't be duplicated but information can be.  </i><br>
<p>
	I would completely disagree with this.  What is there about<br>
the soul that can't be duplicated given the proper ability to<br>
manipulate physical stuff into the proper operating state?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) The soul is and will always remain unfathomable,</i><br>
<p>
	What a depressing thought.  Why would you think this?  I see<br>
no evidence that points to this.  Once we understand and predict the<br>
physics of conscious phenomenon we will fathom it all.  Once we do<br>
this the world will become a very different place in which uploading<br>
and immortality will not be the only differences.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;   but even if the soul exists it will never be proven.</i><br>
<p>
	Why would you say this?  If there is anything there of any<br>
importance, that has any influence at all in this universe, both<br>
consciously and physically, and in our lives, we will eventually<br>
completely understand it just like we know and understand traditional<br>
physics.  Why insist something like this so faithlessly and what<br>
evidence is there to support this assertion of eternal ignorance?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What evidence do you have that two entities can behave exactly the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same way yet have different consciousness?</i><br>
<p>
	You can put on colored glasses which will invert the qualia<br>
you use to represent particular wavelengths of light.  (Or you might<br>
invert the color wiring between your retina and the primary visual<br>
cortex) What you once called blue might become red and what was once<br>
red might become blue.  You will act the same, but you subjective<br>
experience or the way you represent the visual world will be very<br>
different.  And of course your answer two the question: what is red<br>
and blue like would become inverted.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can't prove it but the evidence is very good that what you say is</i><br>
<i>&gt; true.</i><br>
<p>
	No, you simply haven't yet discovered a way to demonstrate<br>
that a red sensation is not an unobservable characteristic.  A big<br>
difference.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The conclusion is clear, intelligence is impossible without</i><br>
<i>&gt; consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
	No.  Machines are intelligent.  They know things.  But this<br>
knowledge is only represented abstractly and not with the phenomenal<br>
stuff of consciousness which we use to represent what we know.  The<br>
two are very different and this difference is what is all important<br>
with consciousness.  A machine can represent joy/desire and behave as<br>
if it is experiencing joy/desire, but it can't, YET, really know what<br>
joy/desire is like.<br>
