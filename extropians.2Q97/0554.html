<i>&gt; Hmm, my bovo-sacrimeter gives clear indications that sacred cows are</i><br>
<i>&gt; present in this debate. Please take the proper precautions and especially </i><br>
<i>&gt; avoid rhetoric (it feeds them). </i><br>
<p>
Rhetoric is a wonderful art in its own right.  That many use it as a<br>
substitute for reason is unfortunate, but that doesn't imply that one<br>
can't use it in addition to reason.  Tools are just tools, neither<br>
good nor evil; it is the mind wielding them that determines that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Utopia might not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; possible, but since I can't run simulations of whole societies to find</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; out, I must rely on principle and reason.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I hope we will be able to remedy that in the near future. People are </i><br>
<i>&gt; already doing alife simulations of simple societies (usually rather </i><br>
<i>&gt; ant-like) and of course the evolution of cooperation. It would be </i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting (and probably only a matter of time) to study a more </i><br>
<i>&gt; realistic model where different social structures could be tested. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Simulations support reason, at least when everyone is allowed to test </i><br>
<i>&gt; them and their basic assumptions are known.</i><br>
<p>
That would be marvellous.  Axelrod's original result was quite stirring,<br>
and more complex ones would be a great accomplishment. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Reason tells me that a free</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; society would work, and would be less likely to commit the atrocities</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that every govenment in human history has committed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Suggestion: why not explain this clearly and logically in a way (say) a </i><br>
<i>&gt; ten-year old could understand, and then let your opponent put forth his </i><br>
<i>&gt; model in the same simple way. Then we can start analyzing what reason </i><br>
<i>&gt; tells us (but don't forget history; reason isn't always right). </i><br>
<p>
Many others have done a far better job of that than I, and I have<br>
little patience to debate what I consider "basics" of libertarian<br>
thought.  I'm more interested in the contentious fringes: intellectual<br>
property law, origination of rights, perpetuities and covenants,<br>
and so on.  Debating whether schools should be private or public is<br>
about as interesting to me as it would be for a physics professor to<br>
debating whether heavy things fall faster than light things. <br>
