I don't think the liver "decides" whether to turn food energy into glycogen<br>
or fat. It may be the liver that converts food energy to glycogen or fat. If<br>
your glycogen stores are depleted in your muscles or your liver, then the<br>
food energy goes to replenish them. But if they are not depleted, how can it<br>
store any more glycogen there? <br>
<p>
As i understand it, if you exercise and deplete your glycogen stores, then<br>
when you eat the food energy will be preferentially used to replenish them.<br>
If you have not been exercising and your glycogen stores are not depleted,<br>
then if you eat a bid meal (especially one with a lot of carbs) the food<br>
energy will be stored as fat. <br>
