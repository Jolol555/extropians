<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So simplistic. Half truth.Somewhat valid comment made less valid by</i><br>

<p>
True, its a half truth, because the multiplier effects of taxation at<br>
every level of the economy causes people to pay an average of 60% more<br>
than true market cost for anything they buy. THis means that not only is<br>
50% of your income being taken by government in direct taxes of various<br>
kinds, but 60% of the remainder is being taken indirectly. Essentially<br>
people live on 20% of their earnings, while the government lives on the<br>
other 80%. Makes me almost  yearn for the middle ages, when we mere<br>
peasants only expected 10% of their earnings to be taken each year.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some families likely feel this is stealing - and the compulsary nature of</i><br>
<i>&gt; taxation does not work out for everyone. This is a valid point. Some find it</i><br>
<i>&gt; acceptable, others not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Qualified in that light it *could* be fairly called stealing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But not if I agree to pay it willingly. And I would.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, many women voluntarily stay with the husbands and boyfreinds who<br>
beat them regularly too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, among those who favor educational taxation, some agree that if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; was spent better,  we would willingly pay for social institutions like</i><br>
<i>&gt; schools, and would even spend *more* on education ( for the selfish reason of</i><br>
<i>&gt; wanting a better, more  advanced society) - even some who do not have school</i><br>
<i>&gt; aged children. The problem is far more complex, and in most debates,</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments abound as to where and how the money is misused and if private</i><br>
<i>&gt; sector schools not controlled by and involving less govt. money would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; better.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Then we get into voluntary taxation, trusts, school bonds, vouchers, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; GC</i><br>
<p>
I think that the comparison between public and private education is an<br>
excellent example of where free society out performs compulsory society<br>
in every way. Taxation for education probably would be spent more<br>
efficiently if school systems had to compete with each other like<br>
private insitutions do. As a contrast to our monopolistic primary<br>
educational system, we can even look at publicly financed college<br>
education, where colleges do not have guarranteed student bodies, and<br>
have to compete with each other for customers. While our primary<br>
educational system is considered the laughing stock of the<br>
industrialized world, no one can say anything but praise for our college<br>
system. We have free markets and competition to thank for that.<br>
