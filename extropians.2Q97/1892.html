<i>&gt; The large MIME attachments are annoying as well.  I suppose if I had a</i><br>
<i>&gt; MIME compliant reader these would just clutter a directory somewhere.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular one, application/ms-tnef, is one I see a lot.  What is it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; I assume it is added by a Microsoft mail client.  Is it a rich-text</i><br>
<i>&gt; formatted version of the message?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, exactly.  MS Exchange for Win95 puts those in, but the software<br>
allows that feature to be turned off, as it should be.  Netscape mail<br>
is another MIME-clutter offender and sends 8-bit mail as well, which<br>
can confuse some readers.<br>
<p>
MIME in general is a good thing, but few mailers do it well; most<br>
use it to obscure more than to clarify.<br>
<p>
ASCII is one of the few standards in this industry that people<br>
generally took seriously and that has been stable for along time.<br>
One should generally stick with it unless you really /need/ the<br>
extra capabilities of mime (say for sending pictures).<br>
