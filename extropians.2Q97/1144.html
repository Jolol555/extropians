<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Media propaganda.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; WHose? The Cuban Government jams all US radio and television boradcasts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the point of occasionally interfering in the southern Florida</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; broadcast market area. Cubans get a banana version of the BBC: 3</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; channels of government propaganda.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not only see TV and radio as media, but also people. Trained</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; demagogues who are supposed to infiltrate Cuba.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, you know, trained demagogues are out in force all over the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; defending Cuba -- take you, for example. And yet, we don't see people</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fleeing the west for the socialist paradise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure. I get money from these evil communists dwelling everywhere for</i><br>
<i>&gt; correcting gross mistakes made by Libertarians like you. The communist</i><br>
<i>&gt; world conspiracy is coming your way. Time to defend your property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Such operations have always taken place, not only in Cuba, but in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; other countries, too. When you see big demonstrations in the Tv,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; like in Bosnia, Bulgaria etc., this can only be the effect of media</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; propaganda.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You know, its amazing how close that assessment is to the one that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Richard Nixon gave for anti-Vietnam war protests. "Outside</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Agitators". No one on their own could *possibly* dislike someone like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Slobodan Milosovich -- after all, he's the friend of the workers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; right?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes. The war in Bosnia was a product of western capitalist countries,</i><br>
<i>&gt; designed to change power structures in that region and to push arms</i><br>
<i>&gt; industry.</i><br>
<p>
Actually it was a tool to prop up production and sales of Russian arms<br>
in the face of lessening western aid to Russia for economic conversion.<br>
SInce the Russians were dragging their feet in conversion, we cut back<br>
aid, so they started pumping arms sales to Serbia.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I bet the wall fell in East Germany because of those darn trained</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "outside agitators" too, just like with the student protests in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; '60s in the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The wall in Germany fell because of massive media propaganda. Kohl</i><br>
<i>&gt; himself admitted this afterwards and said it would not have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible without western media. Of course hundreds of thousands of</i><br>
<i>&gt; unemployed people in East Germany would prefer socialism now.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, working for a living is just too darn much work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; This little Cuba is, besides North Korea, one of the last socialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; regimes which doesn't privatize itself too much. The effects on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; people living there are bad, and maybe free markets would make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; standard of living better for many of them (making Cuba what it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; under Batista, the brothel and casino of the US)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Yeah. Right now, its so much better with it being the brothel and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; casino of the European countries that send tourists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's simply not the case. Many tourists are disappointed after their</i><br>
<i>&gt; travel to Cuba because there was no single prostitute. Even in Havana</i><br>
<i>&gt; you will find hardly more prostitutes than in Berlin or Cologne.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; -- but if Cuba was a free market country and isolated the way it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; now, you can be sure that it would be much worse there than in North</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Korea.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Dunno. South Africa managed to do pretty well even when it was under</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sanctions. Of course, Cuba isn't *really* isolated -- the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is free to buy anything it likes from Canada, Europe, and South</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; America. Sanctions there are astoundingly porous -- Americans can even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; go there pretty freely if you travel through Mexico or Canada.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A good economy is not only characterized by its growth or size, but also</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the distribution of wealth and the inequality. That's what</i><br>
<i>&gt; Libertarians always forget. And that's why people like you might mean</i><br>
<i>&gt; the end of this planet.</i><br>
<p>
So the fact that resources in Cuba are reserved for Communist Party<br>
members first and foremost is the most egalatarian way to run things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; When you claim that they spread propaganda, you must prove it. It has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; been proven for US media millions of times (see media during Vietnam &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gulf War, presidential elections etc.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Walter Cronkite's painful declaration on the evening news that the war</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in Vietnam wasn't a good thing must be a collective hallucination of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the proletariat, eh?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't remember any politician who said that war is a good thing. Most</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them just said it was necessary. Words are just words, and deeds are</i><br>
<i>&gt; deeds. The US aggression against Vietnam and other communist countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; was simply wrong (although a war can never be justified).</i><br>
<p>
Yup, Saddam was in no way justified in invading Kuwait, was he. We still<br>
were'nt justified in kicking him back out.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; And the media in the US aren't owned by gov't. Why do they support</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Maybe they have this weird idea that its better to be in a free</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; country where they can print what they like?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;very big evil grin&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe you should ask the guys at a-albionic research how free western</i><br>
<i>&gt; media are.</i><br>
<p>
The media is free, but it is biased. I can say whatever I want here,<br>
publish it, even send a letter to the editor and expect it to be printed<br>
(just look at all the letters that creationists and even Tim McVeigh<br>
have had published). I can do all this here and not be afraid of being<br>
"dissapeared" for it. What is not guarranteed is that anyone will be<br>
interested enough to listen, or to believe what I say.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am no communist. I wouldn't want to live in Cuba, North Korea or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; China. I already said that my "dream-economy" is that of Japan,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; partially because of state intervention, partially because of a kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; "politics of consent".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I see you know at least as much about Japan as you do about most other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You bore me. Your mental abilities seem to be limited to insults and</i><br>
<i>&gt; rant.</i><br>
<p>
No comeback eh? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Big enterprise leaders there have realized that operating the way US</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; leaders do would lead their country back to the Middle Age.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Strange that the U.S. isn't back in the middle ages. I guess we just</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have a shortage of cathedrals and hand illuminated manuscripts</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; standing between us and economic chaos.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With 15 % poor people, low education standard, a rich power elite,</i><br>
<i>&gt; propaganda by TV religions and enterprise advertising, growing</i><br>
<i>&gt; inequality and a hardly existant welfare system, the US are one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; saddest examples for free markets ins world history and will remind</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone with a little bit of brain capacity of the Middle</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ages.</i><br>
<p>
Reminds me of a Dilbert cartoon. Gee, if you get rid of the poorest 15%,<br>
you will still have a poorest 15%, which you can do over and over until<br>
the richest people are part of the poorest 15%.<br>
<p>
The "growing inequality", whill accurate, is disingenuous. Just because<br>
the rich are getting richer does not mean that the poor are getting<br>
poorer. In our case, it means that the poor are not getting richer as<br>
fast as the rich are getting richer. Despite the propaganda you have<br>
been brainwashed with, most especially from liberal media sources, the<br>
poor are definitely NOT getting poorer here.<br>
