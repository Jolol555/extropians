<i>&gt; Both of these seem like reasonable statements, but neither of them </i><br>
<i>&gt; are what I claimed!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Again: A single game can have multiple equilibria, even if the "rules"</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the game are held constant.  The action you want to take given your</i><br>
<i>&gt; options and preferences typically depends on what actions you think</i><br>
<i>&gt; other people will take.  There can be more than one set of</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-consistent and mutually-reinforcing expectations.  So I advocate</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we discuss our expectations and desires regarding sex role</i><br>
<i>&gt; actions, so that we can reach *some* equilibria between them.</i><br>

OK, let me see if I can understand your point in my terms.  (1) A simple<br>
game can have multiple equilibria, at equal or different payoff levels.<br>
Agreed, from basic game theory. (2) We would prefer to find such a local<br>
maximum which is also one of the global maxima.  (3) There are legitimate<br>
reasons to suspect that the /actual/ behaviors and expectations of others,<br>
as distinguished from game theory's usual assumption of perfection, may<br>
have a great effect on one's ability to reach the desired equilibrium, and<br>
it is therefore advisable to learn about them.  (4) Especially where there<br>
are multiple global maxima, your perfectly rational choice to pursue a<br>
particular one may be a sub-optimal strategy if you have good reason to<br>
believe the majority of your opponents pursue a different one. (5) A<br>
society stuck at one of the sub-optimal local maxima may be highly<br>
resistant to the changes necessary to bring it to a better state, so it<br>
is a good idea to learn to recognize that situation.<br>
<p>
Is that better?  Even given that my children will be better able to<br>
reason their way to good solutions than I can, it might be worth the<br>
effort to study what we expect the actual behaviors of the society<br>
they grow up in might look like.  I don't think I could argue with that,<br>
but I still don't personally find it as interesting or fruitful as<br>
philosophy itself, so I don't understand your surprize at getting less<br>
response than you expected.  Each of us has different interests and<br>
different evaluations of worthy goals.<br>
