<i>&gt; I've just finished reading Dave Chalmer's book The Conscious Mind, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; left me wondering exactly *what* he *is* saying... but I think you've got</i><br>
<i>&gt; it turned around, Hal.  Chalmers' argument for the singular and unreductive</i><br>
<i>&gt; character of consciousness is based firmly on the feasibility of</i><br>
<i>&gt; counterfactual possible worlds which are replete with zombies.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt; critters are identical with us down the quantal level, but lack the</i><br>
<i>&gt; supervenience of consciousness and hence lack `experience' and `qualia' -</i><br>
<i>&gt; even though they claim to have them (being perfect behavioural emulations</i><br>
<i>&gt; of conscious people).  Certainly Dave argues against *us* being zombies -</i><br>
<i>&gt; he rejects the John Clark model, in other words - but his whole argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; hangs on the modal possibility that a zombie world *is* intelligible.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't think it is, in rather the way I don't think it's genuinely possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; to ask the hoary old question `why is there anything rather than nothing?'</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think we *can* conceive of the absence of literally *everything*,</i><br>
<i>&gt; just of the absence of certain structures.  The rest is just words,</i><br>
<i>&gt; free-floating and (in such cases) delusive signifiers.</i><br>
<p>
I have not read Chalmers' book, but I have read several of the papers on<br>
his web site and I've seen discussion on comp.ai.philosophy.<br>
<p>
I agree with you that Chalmers' notion that a zombie world is "logically"<br>
possible is questionable.  He eventually rejects the possibility, as you<br>
say.  But he is willing to entertain it as a hypothetical starting point.<br>
<p>
The question of whether zombies are logically impossible versus merely<br>
physically impossible is a bit too subtle for my grasp of philosophy.<br>
It seems to me that the kinds of arguments philosophers make are basically<br>
logical and don't really depend on the nature of the physical world.<br>
I suppose they are not logical in the strict sense of axiomatic deduction;<br>
even in the fading qualia example Chalmers admits that it is conceivable<br>
that consciousness would behave in that bizarre and counter-intuitive way,<br>
where people are unable to describe their fading consciousness.<br>
<p>
Is it this loophole in his argument that forces him to leave open the<br>
possibility of zombies?  In that case I would say that the problem<br>
is that his argument is not airtight, rather than that it is based on<br>
the nature of the physical world.  The conclusion I draw is that it is<br>
*very likely* that zombies are logically impossible, not that they are<br>
logically possible but physically impossible.<br>
