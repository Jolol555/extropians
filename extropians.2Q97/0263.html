<p>
Unfortunately the evidence is rather sparse and spotty, so it is hard to<br>
evaluate. I would say there are intriguing results out there that<br>
definitely merits further research, but hardly any proof. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; By good experimental evidence, I mean double-blind, controlled, cross-over</i><br>
<i>&gt; experiments. One of the newest discoveries--ampakines--having been found to</i><br>
<i>&gt; improve memory in older people, are being tested on young folks by</i><br>
<i>&gt; researchers like Gary Lynch at UC Irvine. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, this seems quite promising. I'm going to do some actual research now<br>
on a memory model, and the professor of my research group (Martin Ingvar<br>
of the Karolinska Institute) has been involved in testing the ampakines.<br>
I'll see if I can get some useful data from him.  (My memory model<br>
actually suggests one possibility for how cholinergic nootropics work, but<br>
it is just a hunch right now). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Do you discount *all* the studies cited in books like Smart Drugs and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nutrients by Dean and Morgenthaler. Certainly, the evidence is often in</i><br>
<i>&gt; terms of theoretical arguments that these substances ought to work and come</i><br>
<i>&gt; along with pretty useless personal stories. However, there *are* some</i><br>
<i>&gt; studies that apparently used good methodology. I'm wondering whether you</i><br>
<i>&gt; just haven't come across these, or whether you have reasons to dispute all</i><br>
<i>&gt; such cases.</i><br>
<p>
I haven't read SDaN yet, but my impression is that it may be convincing <br>
but not necessarily correct. Making sure a study has a good methodology <br>
is HARD, especially in a fuzzy area such as cognitive medicine, and it is <br>
easy to be fooled by one's convictions. A lot of arguments are built on <br>
animal experiments (one of my recurring nightmares: the rat hippcampus <br>
does something completely different from the human hippocampus) and <br>
individual studies, which is weak. The nootropics movement really needs <br>
some clear, careful research, but in the current situation that may be <br>
hard to implement. <br>
