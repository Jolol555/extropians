     Imagine searching though all that raw data for interesting stuff. Puts<br>
     home movies to shame. What about extra legal activities?? What about<br>
     stuff considered private, like excretion? As a cryonicist I might find<br>
     it useful though....<br>

     <br>
     This reminds me of the tremendous amount of documents from the tobacco <br>
     industry that had to be sifted through to determine the level of <br>
     accountability by the tobacco industry on their cover-up and <br>
     conversion.  Prior to scanning and locating technology, it would take <br>
     a team of individuals YEARS to pour through it all.  Now, they scanned <br>
     all the docs into Adobe Acrobat and did programmed searches for <br>
     keywords and found substantial amounts of evidence.  $368.5 billion <br>
     later (hopefully more...)...&lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     &lt;Just had to get a dig in against one of he most vile empires on the <br>
     planet but back to the original thread&gt;<br>
     <br>
     Presumably, by the time we can achieve virtual immortality through <br>
     mass storage of a life's experiences, we will have also developed <br>
     intelligent agents to bookmark, condense or otherwise streamline the <br>
     experiences so that we got the most relevant stuff.  <br>
     <br>
     Of course, this also leads to some pretty (presently, in my view) <br>
     strange fetish practices if you could indeed chain all one's "potty" <br>
     moments into a digest.<br>
     <br>
     The issue of privacy, the individual's decision as to what to and NOT <br>
     to include seems like it would factor in.  If it were a ubiquitious <br>
     thing, I'd likely just (like Data shutting off his emotion chip in the <br>
     last Star Trek movie) flick off the recording with an intention and/or <br>
     flick of my head during a private moment.  But boy would I love the <br>
     opportunity to observe my own boyhood and compare my perception with <br>
     the one I have today.  Particularly, re-experiencing some of my <br>
     "firsts" would be quite illuminating.<br>
