<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;I did, in an excellent book called Fit for Life, written by a</i><br>
<i>&gt;nutritionist/researcher.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
I know this will probably provoke a flameway, but FFL is a joke.  The writers<br>
don't even have the understanding necessary to pass a one-year college bio<br>
class (quite literally, example below).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;You know what the worst food combination is?  Meat and potatoes.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;chemicals in each cancel out the digestive chemicals in your stomach,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;becoming undigestibabl and rotting in your stomach and intestines for a</i><br>
day<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;like it was sitting in the hot sun.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;This is horsehockey.  The digestive chemicals in your stomach are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;hydrochloric and butyric acid.  Neither meat nor potatoes (nor any other</i><br>
<i>&gt;food</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you'd eat) will cancel that.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fit For Life explains how that process works, it has to do with acids and</i><br>
<i>&gt;bases I believe.  All foods require a certain counterpart chemical in our</i><br>
<i>&gt;bodies to complete the digestion, and some chemicals can cancel each other</i><br>
<i>&gt;out.</i><br>
<p>
Yes indeedy they "explain" it.  One needs acid, the other base, when the two<br>
are produced together in the digestive tract, they cancel and neither works.<br>
<p>
The problem with this "explaination" is that not one, but *both* of the<br>
primary premises are wrong.  *Both* starch and protein require *both* acid<br>
and base for normal digestion, but the acids and the bases are produced in<br>
different places and do not interfere with each other.  To be technical,<br>
digestion is primarily performed by *neither* acid nor bases, but by neutral<br>
enzymes.  <br>
<p>
Briefly, food is eaten, gets churned in the strongly acidic stomach for a few<br>
hours, is passed into the duodenum where the acids are neutralized, and then<br>
is passed to the slightly basic small intestines where digestive enzymes<br>
(amylase for starch, protease for protein) do their work.  Whether you eat<br>
starch, protein, or a mixture thereof, you get the same process.  The stomach<br>
is always acid and the intestines always basic.  This whole shebang is in any<br>
introductory biology course or text.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, the intestines are very mildly basic and the base there<br>
wouldn't digest anything.  Some people take drugs to suppress stomach acid<br>
production and digestion works just fine for them.  In other words, when the<br>
body produces neither digestive acids nor digestive bases, food gets digested<br>
anyway.  However, if you block the digestive enzymes (e.g. starch blockers)<br>
food doesn't get digested.  <br>
<p>
In spite of the terror the food combining folks display towards undigested<br>
food, it doesn't have many really bad effects.  Fiber is undigested food and<br>
the effects of eating lots of food you can't digest is just the same as that<br>
of eating too much fiber (beans, say) - gas, bloating, and sometimes mild<br>
diarrhea.  You don't need to go to the hospital, just to the bathroom and<br>
your underwear drawer.<br>
<p>
You would think that people writing books on nutrition would know that the<br>
stomach and the intestines are separate organs, that one is always acidic and<br>
the other always basic.  You'd think that people writing books on nutrition<br>
would now what happens to food not fully digested.  But you'd be wrong.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;It's a pity, really.  Calorie restriction is a great way to extend</i><br>
lifespan.<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; If all I had to do was to eat meat and potatoes together and nothing would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;get digested, I'd be set.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, doing that would probably result in a hospital visit.  That</i><br>
<i>&gt;combination releases tons of waste and harmful byproducts.</i><br>
<p>
Don't be silly.  People eat meat and potatoes all the time and the only time<br>
it makes them go to the hospital is if the meat is already spoiled.<br>
