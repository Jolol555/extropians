You're changing question in mid-stream.  Genome matching might be<br>
usefully feasible now, or in ten years; it hasn't exactly been around<br>
for anyone trying to domesticate nasty animals in the past.  Considering<br>
the 5-10 year generation time for apes, and their low utility and high<br>
danger to begin with, it seems very plausible to me that it was never<br>
economical to domesticate them.  "We don't know how long it takes"?<br>
Perhaps, but I think believing an agressive species could be noticeably<br>
domesticated in less than 10 generations is like John Clark's claim that<br>
godhood will be feasible seconds after the first nano-assembler.  And 10<br>
generations for an ape is the better part of a century.  And I suspect<br>
it would take more generations... you need to be improving docility and<br>
immunity and utility simultaneously.  You might be able to get a few<br>
docile animals quickly, but the gene pool will be small.  If you try to<br>
get a pool of animals who don't get sick too easily outside of their<br>
natural environment, you're spending a lot of time on agressive,<br>
non-useful (low-return) animals.  I don't buy it.<br>
<p>
The fact that 21st century gengineers could produce a domesticated zebra<br>
doesn't change the lack of success modern "scientific" breeders have had<br>
so far, or the lack of success anyone had in the past -- when it would<br>
have been rather more useful!<br>
<p>
} &gt;I see no reason to assume an AI, human-level or not, would be as<br>
} &gt;intractable as most animals.  (Apart from the non-existence problem<br>
} Possibly.  But this sounds a lot like wishful thinking.<br>
<p>
Why?  Why should an AI be hard to "domesticate"?  There are evolutionary<br>
reasons for lots of the factors behind an animal being too vicious or<br>
panicky or territorial; there'd be no reason for AIs to have these<br>
traits.  I think a major predator of chimps is other chimps, as with<br>
humans; AIs won't have evolved any defensive or offensive strategies.<br>
<p>
And about breeding you write<br>
<p>
} it stands to reason that great further improvements will be possible<br>
} when we can cheaply read out the entire genome of each individual in a<br>
} breeding program, match them with detailed behavioral data, and<br>
} even splice together desired trial genomes.<br>
<p>
It stands to reason that all of these abilities apply naturally to AIs with<br>
no less ease, and for some versions far more ease, than to animals.<br>
<p>
} I doubt if we've tried anywhere near as hard to domesticate smart primates<br>
} as we've spent on A.I. research. <br>
 <br>
Is it really rational to spend as much on primate domestication as on AI<br>
research?  Yes, they're farther along, but they're still rather not<br>
ideal, and they're hard to work with.  Not all that many to work with,<br>
for one thing.  AI has a long road, but seems able to move very quickly.<br>
At least once it finds the road.<br>
<p>
As for hypothetical primate compensation... you pay your labor force<br>
what it takes to get them to work, not what you think is fair.  Unless<br>
they get seriously uplifted they won't be taking greenbacks; they'd just<br>
try to eat them.  Bananas.  Access to females.  Not getting beaten.  Or<br>
being bred to a state where they just love to serve us, like dogs.<br>
<p>
Now, how about AI compensation?  Why should we treat an AI as a citizen<br>
if it doesn't ask to be treated as a citizen?  If it's perfectly happy to<br>
fulfill my every wish, to pilot its fighter-body in a kamikaze attack as<br>
enthusiastically as any glory-seeking adolescent male?<br>
<p>
Ethics of designing an AI that way are left up to other debatants.<br>

"Does it occur to you, the fallibility of CIT thinking?  Flux-thinking.<br>
You have prophetic dreams, remember?  You can dream about a man drinking<br>
a glass of milk.  A week later you can see Yanni drinking tea at lunch<br>
and if seeing him do that has a high shock-value, you'll super the<br>
dream-state right over him, you'll swear you dreamed about him doing<br>
that, exactly at that table, and even psychprobe can't sort it out after<br>
that." -- C.J. Cherryh, _Cyteen_, Grant ALX<br>
