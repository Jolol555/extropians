<p>
I know of no evidence that the stars we see are _not_ inside Dyson<br>
spheres.  Let's say we put an opaque sphere around a star.  The star<br>
is radiating away a certain energy per unit time, and your sphere<br>
has to deal with that power.  I suppose you could reflect that energy<br>
back toward the star, but soon you'd end up with a tremendous energy<br>
density inside the sphere.  A good designer would probably try to<br>
balance radiation and gas pressure with gravitational stress on the<br>
sphere (the exact ratio depending on how hot they like it), but once<br>
they reach an equilibrium they'd let all the incoming energy out.<br>
Remember that energy can't reduce entropy, you need a _flux_ of<br>
energy, a thermodynamic engine.  Therefore, a well-designed Dyson<br>
sphere would look just like a star from here.  A paranoid designer<br>
might even go to some length to ensure that the spectrum of the<br>
outgoing radiation looks "natural" to a casual observer.<br>
<p>
In fact, I can hardly see how else can a Dyson sphere be built.<br>
One would start from seeds that would "sail" near the star and<br>
expand themselves in such a way that the gravitational stress at<br>
any point during the construction is kept at an absolute minimum.<br>
Even the finished sphere is gravitationally unstable, it needs<br>
some sort of distributed propulsion mechanism or lots of<br>
controllable openings to keep the star in the middle and to<br>
dampen oscillations.  It's a two-dimensional bridge without<br>
endpoints of pylons---the mother of all engineering nightmares!<br>
