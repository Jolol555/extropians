 AS&gt; ...  So my guess is that combining foods is just a simple strategy to<br>
 AS&gt; be sure you have all nutrients you need by ingesting a bigger mixture,<br>
 AS&gt; nothing more, nothing less. <br>
 <br>
 AS&gt; ...  It should be noted that animalic food<br>
 AS&gt; contains all EAA, it is just vegans who need to worry (?) about them<br>
 AS&gt; and eat a somewhat more diverse diet. <br>
<p>
Yes.  In particular the essential amino acid Lysine is deficient<br>
in plant proteins.  Lysine can prevent glyco-sylation in ageing<br>
and (IIRC) is important for strong muscles and immune function.<br>
<p>
In talking with vegans I am always surprised that so frequently<br>
they are unaware of this possible deficiency.  If the vegan<br>
diet is restricted (perhaps to lose weight) lysine deficiency<br>
is almost inevitable.  Does anyone know of any (relatively rich)<br>
plant sources for lysine ?<br>
