This presumes that the upload does not have control of its clock rate.<br>
If I as an upload want to do something which involves real time delays,<br>
I can suspend myself until the delay is over, eliminating the subjective<br>
experience of everything "out there" being really really slow.<br>
<p>
If I want to use the resources instead of sitting in "wait states" I can<br>
always initiate or fork various versions of myself with can then wait<br>
for thousands of different real time projects. Of course there will be<br>
joins as well as the various tasks are completed.<br>
