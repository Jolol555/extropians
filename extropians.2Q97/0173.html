} However, to those who would automatically dismiss 'old' technologies as<br>

} But I love the sound of the old acoustics: make it sound like one of those."<br>
<p>
This reminds me that I've been wondering about the importance of<br>
self-transformation to reach goals vs. transformation of one's<br>
environment.  I answered some poll on this or the transhuman list once<br>
by saying "transhumanism means being like Della Lu"[1], and Guru George<br>
and I spent some messages discussing the Culture's feasibility with an <br>
agreement that it was a desirable transhuman society in of itself.<br>
<p>
But while both Della Lu-type high-techs and Culture hominids have access<br>
to and use various self-transformations -- mind-computer links, genetic<br>
engineering -- the intensity of use is fairly light.  High-intensity<br>
examples might be Freeman Dyson's comet colonizing ideas, somewhat<br>
realized in Brin/Benford's _Heart of the Comet_ or the symbionts in<br>
Varley's books.  People have modified themselves or been modified to fit<br>
into the cold, vacuumy environment.  Ditto for ideas about modifying<br>
humans to live on Mars.  The more typical alternatives, of course, are<br>
terraforming Mars and turning comets into O'Neill cans.<br>
<p>
So do people see transhumanism/extropy as about self-transformation per<br>
se or about being adaptive?  Means or goals, perhaps?  The examples<br>
above seem more like shifting weaknesses to me -- transhumanism going<br>
sideways, perhaps, rather than upward.  Plain techno-humanism is more<br>
upward in a way, as it remakes the universe ("paves") into forms we can<br>
fit into.  A bit shorter on diversity, though.<br>
<p>
The final "answer" of course, is the subjectivist usual: whatever you<br>
feel like.  But personally I agree with Anders' endgoal.  If I'm going<br>
to muck around with myself, I'd rather add capability rather than change<br>
it.  Not too become a Martian, but either to pave Mars or to become some<br>
super-flexible form that can live anywhere.  (Deep Space 9 changelings<br>
are pretty neat, not counting their violations of the First Law of<br>
Thermo.  They play god, too.)  Or some safe and slightly limited form<br>
that can get experiences from anywhere -- a la Culture Minds, which live<br>
in starships, but could send avatars anywhere they want and reabsorb the<br>
experiences.<br>
<p>
So if Tom saw electric guitars as being a species-change from acoustics,<br>
eww.  But if they can perfectly emulate acoustics as well as lots of<br>
other things, cool.<br>
<p>
Real extropians play really good synthesizers. :)<br>
