John K Clark and Rick Knight engaged in a dialogue which included the<br>
comments:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I concede that stupidity can be hazardous to your health, and perhaps it's a character flaw on my part but I just don't have a burning desire to make the world safe for fools, especially when it would mean less freedom for me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think of it as Evolution in action.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;In most things in a cooperative democracy, there are limits</i><br>
That's one reason most of us on this list do not believe in democracy, I<br>
certainly don't.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Dear fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
Could it be that there is some confusion between stupidity and<br>
ignorance?<br>
<p>
There is a difference between those who do are unenlightened and have<br>
not yet, but are willing to learn, and those who have been taught to<br>
fear knowledge and therefore will not learn beyond the limitations<br>
imposed upon them by their culture.  <br>
<p>
Is it possible that given the appropriate circumstances we call all<br>
learn far more than we have been taught?<br>
<p>
Is it possible that rather than reject democracy as a system we can<br>
learn to adapt the prevailing system to provide for full participation?<br>
<p>
Quo Vadis?<br>
<p>
