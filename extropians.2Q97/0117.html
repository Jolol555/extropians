<i>&gt; Real communities of people who regularly contract with each other have</i><br>
<i>&gt; lots more mechanisms for coordinating expectations regarding</i><br>
<i>&gt; unspecified contract details than just "learning to communicate openly</i><br>
<i>&gt; and deal fairly".  Most such communities spend lots of effort to</i><br>
<i>&gt; socialize new people into the shared community expectations, and often</i><br>
<i>&gt; have lengthy discussions regarding proposed changes in common norms.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that they do, but that's no indication that it's right.  Such<br>
social norms are probably a valuable shortcut to working out what's<br>
honest and fair, but it is the concepts of honesty and fairness that<br>
exist in reality; social norms are merely a matter of consensus, not<br>
reason.  If these shortcuts are valuable to everyday life, it might<br>
make some sense to find those that more closely accord with reason,<br>
and I have no reason to oppose such discussion, I just don't find it<br>
particularly interesting or as valuable as laying the foundations for<br>
solid reasoning on which to base it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It might help you to think in terms of multiple equilibria in a game</i><br>
<i>&gt; in game theory.  In a game it is important to coordinate each player's</i><br>
<i>&gt; expectations regarding what others will do with actual action choices.</i><br>
<p>
This is to sneak in the assumption that the rules of the game include<br>
the social norms.  In that case, certainly knowing your opponents<br>
available choices and likely coices and payoffs is necessary to win<br>
the game.  But the "rules" of the game of life are not constrained by<br>
society, only by the nature of reality.  To play a fair game unbound<br>
by the shackles of convention requires learning the rules of reality,<br>
not the rules of society.<br>
