Well, we'll soon know that David Brin isn't on the list, by his failure<br>
to erupt in response.  So I'll stand in.  World is going down the<br>
toilet?  The world is growing out of the toilet.  Maybe some things are<br>
worse than when you were growing up.  I'm only 22; what's changed in my<br>
life is the collapse of much of the Eastern bloc and a lot of advances<br>
in science and technology.  Along with more democracy in Latin America<br>
and somewhat better conditions in South Africa.  I live in a country<br>
with First and Second Amendments, even if they're not absolute; where<br>
anyone can make fun of any politician or anyone else without legal<br>
sanction; where social respect is largely correlated with wealth (a<br>
better proxy for respect for ability than respect for who your parents<br>
were, or what accent you have); where one can still get a cheap<br>
homestead and live on it in the middle of nowhere, if one wishes and can<br>
live away from the main economy.<br>
<p>
And most people accept that things should be getting better, even if<br>
they think that's not currently the case.  As Brin says, we're the first<br>
civilization to have our Golden Age in our future.  And we're making<br>
measurable progress toward it, even if extropians have somewhat less<br>
mainstream ideas of what the golden age should be.  We're on the top of<br>
the world.  Only some rulers of previous societies had more control over<br>
reality than we do; and except for the ability to boss around people's<br>
lives, most of them don't match up either.  I don't think Augustus had<br>
glass windows.  He sure didn't have kiwi fruit available year round.  Or<br>
printing presses.<br>
<p>
Prohibition: the Sequel, decrepit inner cities, the deficit, and the IRS<br>
aren't nice features of current reality.  They also are far from the end<br>
of the world.<br>
<p>
I know you, John, came to less pessimistic realizations.  But this is a<br>
general thing: for libertarians or transhumanists to not acknowledge<br>
that they are living in the best of all places and times *that have<br>
actually existed so far* is going to get them _justly_ dismissed as<br>
nutty dreamers.  Not visionary dreamers, just nuts.  <br>
