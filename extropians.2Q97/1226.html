This email discusses Managing mail and the Godsend of ADD and short<br>
attention spans. It features at least one shameless plug for the<br>
authors works but includes free tips on mail managing techniques.<br>
<p>
DO NOT DELETE ....IT _may_ BE IMPORTANT (or a waste of your time)  :)<br>

This problem reminds me of a CNN report on 'information overload', it<br>
detailed how we are all going to suffer stress in the future because of<br>
excess info from phone, videophone, fax, pagers, email, the internet, tv,<br>
radio and whatever the tech geeks decide to invent next.<br>
<p>
At the time I laughed. I had just finished "Playing the Future", an<br>
excellent work by Douglas Rushkoff (of "Cyberia" fame) and I had just met<br>
him in Toronto and discussed the same 'problem'.<br>
<p>
Basically there is no problem. There is a lot of data and info, sure, but<br>
you can still only use what you are capable of using.<br>
<p>
Don't moan about having too much - we are so lucky to be living in an age<br>
(nee country, cf. China) where such info is freely available - instead of<br>
whinging why not take a course in speed reading or look into 'intelligent<br>
agent' based email programs that will filter out the crap that you do not<br>
want, "Make Money Fast", "Have You Heard This One", "UnSubscribe ME!"<br>
etc.<br>
<p>
Speed reading and scanning techniques are excellent and you will find that<br>
the younger generation, our kids, already seem to have these<br>
'chaos-surviving' strategies 'built-in'.<br>
<p>
What looks like a short attention span to a parent, or attention<br>
deficiency disorder (ADD) to a child psychologist, is usually a child with<br>
a broader attention 'range'.<br>
<p>
My grandfather was subject to (and therefore could only cope with) maybe 5<br>
new realities/ideas a day (newspapers and books). My parents maybe 10-20<br>
(early television and radio). Me, I cannot comprehend the number I get<br>
thrown at me from mass advertising, cable television, radio, computer<br>
games, the internet etc. etc. etc.<br>
<p>
The average child can cope with 100 times more information than my <br>
grandfather ever could. My grandpop needed information in a linear<br>
single medium form, a book perhaps. Whereas when the Heaven's Gate cult<br>
news broke I was simultaneously watching CNN, reading the papers, flicking<br>
to NBC, then ABC, then to the internet, newsgroups and email. <br>
<p>
Sure, I lost some of the finer points and some of the minute details but I<br>
got a far greater range of opinion, news and comment. Most of the<br>
info I missed was the crap that I was intended to swallow hole,<br>
mainly adverts, agendas and the comment from the 'objective' news<br>
anchors.<br>
<p>
Boredom and anxiety are the two signs to look out for.... anxiety sells<br>
products and agendas... bordom signals that you are not really learning<br>
anything and that you are slowly slipping into a more programable<br>
agenda-susceptable couch-potato-trance mode.<br>
<p>
Such techniques are also more propaganda proof as no one dominant spin can<br>
dominate my knowledge - I make my own spin to suit my own needs.<br>
<p>
This all may be irrelevant to the original post and boring to you<br>
personally, if it is then I hope you deleted it a long time ago.<br>
<p>
If you are still reading then you are either interested in this topic and<br>
would be interested in my article on 'Screenagers - surving in the age of<br>
info-overload' or you are very bad at disregarding the info that you do<br>
not need.<br>
<p>
Take up speed reading or at least learn to 'cut the crap' quicker. Channel<br>
surfing isn't bad - it shows your childrens brains are still alive and<br>
active and not being mashed into a pulp by inane shows and mind-melting<br>
advertisments.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (At least) 95% of everything is trash.</i><br>
<p>
You were refering specificaly to email, as if you were expecting the<br>
medium to be so much cleaner than TV or the papers. You are right 95% of<br>
_*EVERYTHING*_ is crap. 95% of what your read/see/hear/believe is crap.<br>
<p>
Why should your email box be any better than the 80 channels you may, or<br>
may not, have piped into your home? I'm sure your regular mailbox gets <br>
more bills and junk mail than REAL "quality" mail.<br>
<p>
<p>
MY POLICY: If you care<br>
----------------------<br>
<p>
My policy is to scan my mailbox, which is sorted according to subject, and<br>
_immediatly_ tag for deletion anything which isn't _immediatly_<br>
recognisable as interesting, or anything not _instantly_ recognisable as<br>
coming from a trusted and reliable 'contact'.<br>
<p>
It is obviously that you will lose some vital and interesting information<br>
this way. But you cannot watch two good TV programmes at once (even a VCR<br>
means you will miss 1 out of three programmes) and the time saved<br>
outweighs the potential loses. You just have to trust you instincts.<br>
<p>
This method also provides a long time bonus. It will force writers who<br>
wish to be noticed to write clearly/concisely etc. etc. The subject lines<br>
will eventually become more pertinant and descriptive and the first<br>
paragraph, like a news story, will start to be written in a way which will<br>
grab the readers attention. Luckily I am studying communications theory<br>
and journalism and know many techniques of hypnotising my readers. This<br>
email is a bad example but I do urge you to read the aformentioned<br>
article.<br>
<p>
After rapid deletion on immediatly crap looking crap I go back to<br>
what is left and read/reply etc, leaving my best friends (longest mails)<br>
till last. If I still have time (which is rare) I then go back to the<br>
mails I wanted to delete.<br>
<p>
At the end of each session (approx. 1 hour) I usually delete around 200<br>
mails. Often I get hooked on one or two new threads and usually get bored<br>
of one-two. Once a thread is deemed to be 'going nowhere' it is easy to<br>
delete them ALL because they are clumped together (sorted by subject).<br>
<p>
I think email filters are good... but better is to develop a personal<br>
strategy, that way you stretch your limits and learn to cope with the<br>
expanding horizons before you. After a while you'll be surprised at how<br>
much more information you can digest.<br>
<p>
<p>
just a few thoughts..... I hope I didn't waste anyone's time. I was going<br>
to delete Eugene's mail but I had some time on my hands and found the bait<br>
far too tempting.<br>
