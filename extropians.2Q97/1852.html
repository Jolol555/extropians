<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  What can be done to forever kill off this evil, dangerous, and slanderous</i><br>
<i>&gt;  meme that scientific rigor isn't beautiful?  The idea that there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  conflict between rational thought and creativity is common in our</i><br>
<i>&gt;  culture, but anyone who is capable of both knows what hogwash it is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  This idea must be rooted out and exposed before it kills off the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  future of rational thought in future generations.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly!! Yes, absolutely true! THANK YOU for saying so! That false dichotomy<br>
is capable of killing us! And try and stretch around to the other side and<br>
think: What can be done to kill off the dangerous, slanderous meme, that<br>
non-critical thought isn't useful and crucial to the creative process?  That<br>
is brands one forever irrational to use that part of our wetware? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Are the stars less wonderous to me because I understand nuclear fusion?</i><br>
<p>
NO! The wonder remains and is even MORE awesome! <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Is a rose less beautiful because I understand how a high-phosphorous</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fertilizer and a good drip system made it that way? </i><br>
<p>
No, but it won't explain the essence of it's pleasure! And those items are<br>
not particularly appetizing to contemplate in metaphor, whilst the rose...<br>
 <br>
Is a Feynman<br>
<i>&gt;  lecture any less a great work of art than a Wagner opera?  </i><br>
<p>
Wagner to my mind IS one of those critical artists... boring...<br>
<p>
Who are you<br>
<i>&gt;  to ridicule the intense beauty I find in an argument as finely crafted</i><br>
<i>&gt;  as any Michaelangelo sculpture?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
I am so sorry you thought I ridiculed you, Lee, please! I meant no such<br>
thing! Hey - don't be so sensitive! In fact, I admire you, I applaud your<br>
intelligence and focus!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I /am/ an artist, dammit, and not because I have a few silly poems on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  my web page,</i><br>
<p>
Do you really? I must go see, immediately! <br>
<p>
<i> &gt;but because I see the beauty in a mathematical proof, </i><br>
<p>
Ahh, I long to understand that art! It is from what I hear a beauty of<br>
immense pleasure! My mind is having a very hard time with it and I have been<br>
trying...<br>
It is one hope of mine that in this lifetime I can grasp that ancient<br>
beauty...<br>
Thanks for reminding me...<br>
<p>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  inspiring integrity of a rigorous philosphical argument, the fine</i><br>
<i>&gt;  craftsmanship of a good statistical analysis, the impact of a carefully</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tuned paragraph.  I pity those who only see art in trinkets of shape</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and color </i><br>
<p>
Trinkets! Hey, finally someone sees the POINT! <br>
This is a touchstone.... a crux... <br>
You have hit upon the powerfully dangerous and slanderous meme of ART AS<br>
PURELY VISUAL OBJECTS! Thanks Lee, that says it beautifully! Creative<br>
thought, and all the ways to it, *are* art! I am sorry you totally<br>
misunderstood my post about the higher values of "Low- focus", imaginative (<br>
I am not as good at expressing myself as some writer types). I want to stress<br>
that as an Extropian,  I of course value rational thought. It is helpful for<br>
many tasks and Musings..! My point was that both are ultra valuable<br>
especially to creativity of new and unlimited types, <br>
but thanks for your searing and emotional reply, for it shows me how tender<br>
this area is!<br>
 ....thanks for being so passionate about your art(s)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;when the true miracles of the human mind are so much more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  powerful and further-reaching.</i><br>
<p>
I agree wholeheartedly!<br>
<p>
LOVE&lt; QM<br>
