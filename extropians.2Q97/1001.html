<i>&gt; I have heard that in Hebrew there is no form of the verb to be.  I'd be</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in hearing this from someone who speaks the language.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt; addition, are there any other natural languages without a form of to be?</i><br>
<p>
That question isn't meaningful.  The appropriate question is "In other<br>
languages, how are the various meanings that we express using 'to be'<br>
expressed, and in what ways are they better/worse than English?"<br>
<p>
"To be" is used for dozens of different purposes in English, most of<br>
them (but not all) less clear than alternatives.  For example, how does<br>
it express set membership ("I am a human"), inherent and transient<br>
properties ("I am tall, I am hungry"), metaphor (I am a quivering mass<br>
of Jello"), progressive tenses ("I am running"), etc.  "Passive voice"<br>
applies only to positional languages, but other forms of omission or<br>
elision of modals exists in most (even Lojban, only there every such<br>
elision is unambiguous as to what is elided and why).<br>
<p>
Progressive tenses are legal even in E-Prime, so it's the others that<br>
really matter; in particular set membership and elision of modals.<br>
That's where much of what general semanticists complain about resides,<br>
because set membership implies generalization without always saying so.<br>
Generlization is a completely worthwhile, valuable act of cognition,<br>
but it is often abused.  Elision is particularly abusable, and while<br>
it can be used to aid expressiveness, it is more often used to avoid<br>
it.  In English, one can often use passive voice with "to be" to elide<br>
modals, but the question is not whether other languages have "to be";<br>
the question is can they elide modals, and how common is it?<br>
<p>
Any theologist who has studied the Bible can tell you that Hebrew is<br>
every bit as capable of ambiguity and deception as English, whatever<br>
forms are used.<br>
