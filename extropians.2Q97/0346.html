I used to wonder why many nerds seemed to be so socially and emotionally<br>
inept. IMHO, for the usual factors, some of us are better at and more<br>
rewarded for social skills and others of us are better at technical<br>
skills. In many ways the technical skills are simpler in that it is<br>
easier to get replicable results with things than with people. I began<br>
as a very emotionally inept nerdic type, and over the years acquired<br>
some social skills, and a very much better appreciation and knowledge of<br>
emotion and the types of signals emotions indicate. I do often wonder<br>
if, say, a good mentor had appeared in my undergraduate days, I would be<br>
a physics nerd today.....<br>
<p>
And, just as a &gt;H thought, perhaps there are other signaling complexes<br>
yet to evolve as we become more able to manipulate our structures for<br>
experience... <br>
