<i>&gt; From: James Rogers &lt;jamesr@best.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is the question: is your performance truly out of line with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;markets? Absolute returns aren't very interesting -- returns relative</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to market, and the statistical likelyhood of getting there by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;accident, are far more interesting.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Also, remember -- higher return often is a sign of higher risk.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My returns are almost always significantly above the market.  To date I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have returned almost 50% on my stock investments this year.</i><br>
<p>
You take a five month return as being the least bit significant? Take<br>
ten or fifteen random small portfolios and one of them is going to do<br>
better than 15% in five months. Five month returns aren't even worth<br>
mentioning.<br>
<p>
I highly recommend that people read Victor Neiderhoffer's<br>
autobiography "The Education of a Speculator". Victor is one of the<br>
richest men I know. He got that way by futures trading. As he notes in<br>
his book, his performance is enough standard deviations away from the<br>
norm that it is spectacularly unlikely given the size of the<br>
population that he could have gotten where he has by chance.<br>
<p>
Victor is amazingly savage about all sorts of things -- he uses<br>
statistics as a vicious weapon. I think his conclusion is more or less<br>
the same as my far less informed opinion -- that smart, hard working<br>
people can earn more than the market, but that the vast majority of<br>
opinion about the market is spectacularly foolish, and that it isn't<br>
easy to earn above average returns. His lancing of most investment<br>
"advisors" is amazingly good reading.<br>
<p>
Now, James makes fun of earning the "mere" 10% or 12% or whatever that<br>
an index fund will get you. Well, I'd say that there is nothing wrong<br>
with earning less than the maximum you possibly could. The real key is<br>
to save and invest with a reasonable degree of confidence. Earning 50%<br>
a year is nice if you can manage it, but there is nothing wrong --<br>
nothing wrong -- with earning a "mere" 12%. 12% will turn even a<br>
modest savings rate into a spectacularly comfortable retirement. I see<br>
no reason for embarassment at such things.<br>
<p>
I also see no embarassment in a decision like Max made to buy Coca<br>
Cola. If it gets him a nice return over the long run, thats fine. If<br>
it doesn't do that spectacularly, thats fine too. THAT Max is<br>
investing is almost more important than in what -- provided we aren't<br>
talking about really stupid investments like savings bonds.<br>
<p>
