Subject: POLI: Hooray for the 10th Amendment<br>

Michael Lorrey stated in part:<br>
<p>
Concluding their 1997 term, the Supreme Court Justices ruled 5-4 in<br>
favor of states rights proponents and against the Federal Brady Law.<br>
They ruled that federal law cannot commandeer the resources and time of<br>
state officials without compensation to administer the requirements of<br>
federal regulation. It is a usurpation of states 10th Amendment rights.<br>
<p>
<p>
Dear Fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
It's usually a mistake to refer to any written decision of any appellate<br>
court (particularly the U.S. Supreme Court) without examining every nuance<br>
of the court's language.<br>
<p>
In this particular instance, the court ruled (only in part) that duties<br>
cannot be imposed upon the states without due and appropriate<br>
compensation. <br>
<p>
It is my understanding that the two or three rural sheriffs who brought<br>
this action were primarily funded in their initial litigation and appeals<br>
by the National Rifle Association. I think that most of us can understand<br>
that the leadership of the NRA  <br>
would be quite interested in supporting such an action.  <br>
<p>
The claim that many people are being improperly denied the right to bear<br>
arms seems more than slightly specious. The high court has ruled on this<br>
issue as well in great detail. They have concluded that the right to bear<br>
arms is not absolute and can be regulated by the Federal government, the<br>
States and and political subdivisions thereof.<br>
<p>
The need for firearms in our society seem questionable as well in many<br>
instances.<br>
The arguements as to the need for self-defense against predators in our<br>
society is best answered by having professionally trained law enforcement<br>
officials in each community.<br>
<p>
I'm a bit dubious as to the need of hunters for many of the rapid fire<br>
arms that are readily available as well as the need for handguns. The<br>
collected cumulitive evidence indicates that most people who claim they<br>
need a handgun for self defense are usually incapable of using one under<br>
siuations of stress. They frequently end up shooting other family members<br>
or themselves. <br>
<p>
It's possible that the issue of paranoia in our society is entering the<br>
minds of some of you, as well as the numerous psycho-sexual implications<br>
of gun collecting, so I'll let this issue ride while you digest and<br>
consider the bigger picture.  <br>
<p>
For those who are sceptical about my motives. Yes, I am an occasional<br>
casual hunter. Yes, I use a single shot shotgun or a compound bow when I<br>
hunt. Yes, I've had to use deadly weapons in the distant past. No, I did<br>
not enjoy having to use them. The circumstances under which I was required<br>
to use weapons I'll leave to your fertile imaginings.<br>
<p>
