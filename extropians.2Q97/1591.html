     that wonderful? This is the death wish most whimpish religions aspire<br>
     to rather than the rough and tumble, creative destruction of a truly<br>
     pluralistic extropian universe. (It's also why I sometimes hanker for<br>
     heroes and am eager to believe in boundaries for borganisms, and for<br>
     creepy nanofog clouds of grey-goo clones out to consume the <br>
     cosmos...)"<br>

     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     Not to make a pun, but playing the "devil's advocate" here, I can draw <br>
     a few parallels to regular old existence that render the whimpy <br>
     regression archetype fairly innocuous.  <br>
     <br>
     First of all, I maintain that order and novelty seem to ongoingly <br>
     emerge across the millions of years of cosmic time.  Or at least <br>
     that's how it seems.  First there was nothing (or something we call <br>
     nothing), then basic elements and gases, crude matter, hot stars, <br>
     cooling planets, water, vegetation and microscopic organisms, fishes, <br>
     etc.. all the way to hefty brain-stemed HOMO SAPIEN (this one, BTW, <br>
     takes issue with all the flap about training apes for their <br>
     rudimentary service potential and agree that it is probably their <br>
     level of intelligence and curiosity that renders them slave-exempt).<br>
     <br>
     Anyway, so the ongoing evolution that we have theorized has brought us <br>
     to the threshold of human transcendence may just be one long <br>
     inhalation in cosmic time.  There are so many metaphors for cycle, the <br>
     on and off, the to and fro of things.  Granted, some of these cycles <br>
     may be so vast as to not warrant our attention.  But then that begs <br>
     the question as to why it's even necessary to spend an ounce of energy <br>
     despising myths or religious doctrines.  <br>
     <br>
     The only reason I know of is unresolved stuff from an oppressed <br>
     upbringing (mine was Southern Baptist but not ANAL WHACKO Southern <br>
     Baptist, just quaint and inconsistent Southern Baptist).  It certainly <br>
     did a number on me determining where/how I fit in and took a number of <br>
     years to figure out that sexuality choices do not equal an eternity in <br>
     some corner of the universe where I'm destined to suffer in pain.  <br>
     Like I said, "quaint".<br>
     <br>
     Certainly, such cosmic cycles (if they exist at all) give extropian <br>
     thinking plenty of elbow room to expand into unimaginable creatures. <br>
     Still, I can't help but have some connection to the LILA myth since a <br>
     psychedlic trip I had several years ago.  In this dream state, I was <br>
     pulling away layers of space as if they were wallpaper.  I *knew* that <br>
     once I got to the last layer of space, all the answers would be on the <br>
     other side.  As I tore at what I were sure were the last layers of the <br>
     farthest regions of the known universe, I had tremendous anticipation. <br>
      I ripped away the final layer and whadaya know, ANOTHER UNIVERSE!  <br>
     This is going to take an exhaustively long time I thought and I was <br>
     very disappointed.  At that point I asked myself (or was it <br>
     communicated to me), "why would you want to know all the answers, what <br>
     point would there be then?"  <br>
     <br>
     Frankly, thinking too much and too often makes me rather tired and <br>
     despondent.  That's why I perceive it important to keep balance, <br>
     breathe in and exhale out.  Quest then rest.  If the Universe is just <br>
     a big organic (?) diaphragm of cycling energy, then I'm okay with <br>
     that.  But I still get a little annoyed with the fundie that thinks my <br>
     "lifestyle" is going to make eternity a hot and unpleasant prospect.<br>
     <br>
