<i>&gt; Evolution is a pretty simple mathematical phenomenon once you</i><br>

<i>&gt; clear that immoratility serves no purpose to a gene's survival,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and in fact is detrimental in many cases.  Once's you're done</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproducing, your body is no longer useful to your genes' further</i><br>
<i>&gt; replication, so no evolutionary pressure to continue is present.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Evolution serves the replicators (genes, roughly speaking),</i><br>
<i>&gt; not organisms.</i><br>
<p>
Even so it's not clear that discarding the body is a good strategy.<br>
In most cases only a couple of offspring are going to survive the<br>
rigors of infancy, with the challenges to their immune system and<br>
the difficulties due to their small size and inexperience.  In that<br>
case keeping the adult alive will mean that the gene will have three<br>
surviving instances rather than two, a considerable improvement.<br>
The adult has already proven its survival abilities and should be<br>
considered a valuable asset.<br>
<p>
Plus, in each child any given gene has only a 50% chance of being selected.<br>
In the adult it has a 100% chance.<br>
<p>
The real mystery then is why genes allow the reproductive period to stop<br>
rather than working harder to extend fertility.  Actually men are often<br>
fertile into their 60's and even beyond, so this discard-the-body theory<br>
doesn't explain why so many symptoms of aging show up before then.<br>
<p>
Is it just that the genes can't do any better, that despite their best<br>
efforts, errors and waste accumulate and the cells just don't work<br>
as well?  Why then are egg cells kept so fresh and clean generation<br>
after generation?  Think about it: every cell in your body is the direct<br>
offspring via fission of an earlier cell, and that line *literally* goes<br>
back billions of years.  Somehow it was able to keep itself clean and<br>
avoid accumulated junk, until the last couple of dozen cell generations,<br>
since it became part of your kidney or whatever.  All of a sudden it's<br>
just too difficult to prevent damage?  After millions and millions<br>
of generations?  That's hard to believe.<br>
<p>
Probably a better theory is that the genes could have kept people alive<br>
and fertile longer, but that it didn't help because death by misfortune<br>
was still so common.  The healthiest man (or ape) in the world might<br>
not have expected to live much beyond 50 due to the harsh and dangerous<br>
world he lived in.<br>
<p>
And actually, humans live pretty long compared to most mammals.  Many of<br>
us have experienced the sadness of a pet dog or cat dying after only 10<br>
or 20 years.  Maybe that was all they could expect in the wild even if<br>
they stayed healthy.  It could be that our own lifespan has increased in<br>
the last few million years, as our increased intelligence allowed us<br>
to avoid dangers.  70 years isn't that bad by this reasoning - it could<br>
have been a lot worse.<br>
