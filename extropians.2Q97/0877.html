<i>&gt;         Come now, Erik.  First of all, I must comment that you are speaking</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the extropian list about a fundamental list ideal...a general faux pas.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You are most certainly entitled to your own beliefs, but the tone in which</i><br>
<i>&gt; you are conveying them appears to be one of condescension.</i><br>
<p>
Not to mention that he is wholly inaccurate. While the differential<br>
between our richest citizens and poorest citizens is larger than<br>
anywhere else, we still have the richest poor people in the world (save<br>
countries like Luxembourg and Kuwait that have no poor citizens, the<br>
poor ones are non citizens). How many nations count a TV, VCR, and<br>
automobile as part of a poverty level existence?<br>
<p>
If you think its just my American bias, listen to Stalin's grandson who<br>
is on record as saying: "In my country, we struggle to make everyone<br>
equally poor, while in your country, you struggle to make everyone<br>
equally rich." That is the essential difference between socialist and<br>
free market economies.<br>

<i>&gt;         Second of all, if you are going to persist in ethical arguments,</i><br>
<i>&gt; please back your posts up with some facts as well as opinion.  As the posts</i><br>
<i>&gt; stand now, they seem to be more ranting and raving about personal thoughts</i><br>
<i>&gt; than fact-based economical arguments.  Please consider what other people</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to say, rather than charging ahead with set ethics.  Most of all, keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; your mind open...no-one likes a cynic.</i><br>
