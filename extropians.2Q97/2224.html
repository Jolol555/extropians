<p>
If it is known unequivocably that he did it (photographs, multiple<br>
witnesses, multiple DNA traces (in more than just flaked skin<br>
quantities)), then not only is he a mad dog, but he is a mad dog without<br>
integrity. With the level of fraud, dishonesty, rudeness, and<br>
callousness in this society today, it would take making killing someone<br>
for cutting in line homicide in the public interest a justified defense<br>
before people start to treat each other with respect for space, privacy,<br>
etc. Its all to do with the concept of mercy. If we now you did it, and<br>
admit to it, accept what ever punishment is deemed necessary, then you<br>
are worthy of redemption much more than the guy who continues to deny it<br>
in the face of overwhelming evidence.<br>

I've seen it. As I recall, the guy who escaped was innocent. If you<br>
remember his case, his tire tracks were found outside the house of the<br>
scene of the crime, he had no alibi, and was drinking. There was no<br>
enuequivocal evidence, only loose circumstantial evidence.<br>
