Let me see if I can get this right.  Start with a self replicating organism,<br>
the faster it replicates, the more accurately it replicates and the longer<br>
it is not destroyed the more copies of it there will be around at any given<br>
time.  The organism may mutate or be copied with differences.  The organism<br>
may compete with it's copies and/or mutated copies for resources.  At no<br>
time are the number of copies increased by removing the original and no<br>
unmutated copy is any more productive than the original but the original <br>
becomes a progressively smaller part of the number of organisms.<br>
<p>
Some types of mutated organisms survive, or replicate more often than <br>
others. They become more plentiful. These organisms can cooperate, gang-up <br>
or practice many other behaviors and the behaviors that most contribute <br>
to fast replication, accurate replication and individual survival will be <br>
the ones that are present in greatest numbers.<br>
<p>
These organisms can be classified into those that go for lots of <br>
copies and those that go for a few copies with more resources allotted <br>
to each.  It all gets more complicated when we introduce sexual <br>
reproduction, niches, and organisms that build bodies around themselves <br>
consisting of other organisms. None of this gets away from the concept <br>
that what last the longest and makes the greatest number of faithful <br>
copies of itself is that which will be most common.<br>
<p>
Of course as others have mentioned there are destructive genes that<br>
survive only because they happen to be near beneficial genes.  And<br>
there are genes that help an organism survive and reproduce when<br>
young, only to cause it trouble latter.  And yes a more slowly <br>
reproducing older organism can get in the way of it's more productive<br>
offspring.  Once an organism can no longer reproduce it’s contributes<br>
to genetic survival by it’s own existence and by assisting it’s offspring.<br>
Evolution increases individual survival and reproduction whenever<br>
it is economical to do so but reproduction is often the easier thing to<br>
enhance.<br>
<p>
Another interesting strategy involves organisms that do not replicate<br>
themselves but rather make mutated versions of themselves.  Organisms<br>
that create other mutated organisms have a chance to create something<br>
which is more likely to become common than their creator.  At this<br>
point a competition can develop between different lines of mutating<br>
processes with some processes becoming more common than others.  <br>
<p>
This introduces a concept that is new to me.  If I view evolution as a<br>
competition between systems of chemical reactions to produce as many<br>
other chemical reactions as possible I gain a different perspective.  <br>
Evolution becomes not a competition for survival but instead a <br>
competition for effect with survival and replication being<br>
part of the equation but not as important as keeping something going.<br>
This is very in line with my own goals with the difference being that<br>
I place a higher premium on being around to see what happens.<br>
<p>
Human genes look like the best things so far at producing long<br>
life with rapid adaptive change. Clearly intelligence is a win but <br>
the human species may be a bit to chaotic and start the whole process <br>
over or it may create a more efficent species to replace it.  Biology<br>
(like my post) often takes 7 right turns to go left.  <br>
<p>
I'll go back to personifying genes now.  What genes want is to create<br>
the most capable and durable things they can.  To do this of course<br>
they want intelligent beings capable of complex behavior.  They want<br>
beings that eventually reach a point where starting over is unlikely<br>
to yield anything better and instead evolve by making gradual<br>
modifications to themselves.  <br>
<p>
They want a universe full of capable beings that choose cooperation <br>
over violent competition because they are more likely to survive <br>
that way and want to avoid starting over with new beings when <br>
the odds of getting something better are remote.  The genes<br>
also feel it is important to get as much life energy out of the<br>
slowly cooling universe as possible by capturing highly energetic<br>
molecules and harnessing them to do useful work on relatively cold<br>
and lifeless matter.<br>
<p>
The genes are really quite reasonable and want nothing more than to<br>
see us thrive.  Really their main flaw is that they are a little<br>
dense and they are from Missouri.  Once we show them that we are<br>
what they have been working for all these many millions of years,<br>
by eliminating aging, and not engaging in destructive competition<br>
with other highly capable life forms when a constructive alternative <br>
is available, I am sure they will be thrilled and trouble us only a <br>
little.  <br>
<p>
Immortality does not short circuit evolution but rather completes<br>
one phase of it.  Immortality or at least extreme longevity is one <br>
of the things evolution tends to produce (gray goo is another <br>
possibility but I am an optimist).  <br>
<p>
Anyway, this topic is starting to remind me of some lectures on <br>
neural nets, how to avoid getting stuck in sub optimal minimums <br>
by introducing chaos, and the ways I might enhance the process <br>
by cycling the level of chaos and consolidation in a goal directed<br>
way, so I’ll go try to find something more useful to do.<br>
