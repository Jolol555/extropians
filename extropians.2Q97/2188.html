I don't see that it would have much effect, since the spammers don't pay<br>
for it... sure, they have to sort out the junk, but they can hire a few<br>
minimum wage workers for that. You'll pay far more to send them the<br>
snail-mail than they'll pay to sort it. <br>
<p>
Personally, as much as I dislike spam I'm no longer too concerned about<br>
it. I now have some pretty sophisticated mail-filtering software on my<br>
account which has at least a 90% success rate, and the few messages which<br>
get through *might* not be 'real' spam (i.e. they're sent directly to me<br>
and have at least *some* relation to the things I have on my Web site). <br>
<p>
So from my point of view it's merely forced me to develop some software<br>
which I really should have done ages ago, and which in future I can<br>
probably extend to delete mailing list messages which I'm probably not<br>
going to be interested in. As more and more people start to use this kind<br>
of software spam will slowly disappear, or they'll have to give us an<br>
incentive to read it, such as including an ecash payment with the message. <br>
That's the only way to really stop the spammers; develop technology so<br>
that spamming simply doesn't work. <br>
<p>
In case anyone's interested, I'm basically using the following procedure: <br>
<p>
	Always pass PGP-encrypted or PGP-signed mail (since I can <br>
		eventually update that to pass or block based on PGP <br>
		keys)<br>
	Always pass mail from my friends and mailing lists (of course<br>
		the header could be faked, but few spammers would go<br>
		that far; and I haven't seen enough spam posted to the <br>
		lists to worry about scanning for it)<br>
	Autodelete anything sent from known spam sites<br>
	Autodelete anything with some magic words in the header<br>
		(e.g. known spammers IP addresses)<br>
	Count the number of magic words (e.g. 'MLM', 'Make Money') in the <br>
		message subject and body, and increase the count if the <br>
		message isn't sent directly to me or in various other <br>
		circumstances. If the count is over one limit then it's <br>
		saved to a spam folder which I clear out every few weeks, <br>
		and if it's over a higher limit the message is just deleted.<br>
<p>
So far I've had no false positives for deletion and &lt;1% false positives<br>
for the spam folder, and the extra overhead is only a fraction of a second<br>
per message; since the processing is all done on the ISP I also don't have<br>
to worry about the cost of downloading the extra mail to process it<br>
locally (e.g. last year most of my Net access was through Internet Cafes).<br>
I'd really like to make the content analysis more sophisticated, but I'm<br>
not sure where to look for information on text analysis. Any suggestions? <br>
