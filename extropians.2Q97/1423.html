<i>&gt; It is not certain the optimal state is total unity, that might cause</i><br>
<i>&gt; undue waste of bandwidth. If bandwidth is limited there is no point</i><br>
<i>&gt; in broadcasting all mental activity, so keeping some of it internal</i><br>
<i>&gt; is reasonable. The topology of the network is also important, since</i><br>
<i>&gt; it might cause differentiation: a group of units somewhat isolated</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the Collective would form a small borganism relatively loosely</i><br>
<i>&gt; connected with the Collective, and if the units were stringed out we</i><br>
<i>&gt; would get a "linear mind" (like the tine sentries in AFUTD).</i><br>
<p>
An interesting organism that I have speculated on is one that takes up the<br>
entire universe.  If the speed of light was a barrier for such a creature<br>
its thought processes would be interesting indeed.  Perhaps this is what is<br>
meant by "linear mind" but I have yet to read AFUTD.<br>
