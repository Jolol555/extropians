Interesting how you placed my handle in quotes. A subtle dig -- or not<br>
so?<br>
<p>
Ignorance, indeed. <br>
<p>
Privacy, Anton, is a thing of the past. <br>
<p>
Without splitting hairs, to cling to the idea that what we do is in any<br>
way private, or even should be, is IMO worthless. Technology will see to<br>
that. When the first hot-air ballooner lifted himself over a wall and<br>
saw what the neighbors were really doing, what did the neighbors scream?<br>
Probably something to do with privacy. So then we should've scrapped the<br>
idea of flight? I can't wait until someone figures out a way to read a<br>
person's mind. What will be the first thing the Philistines will scream?<br>
It will probably have something to do with privacy.<br>
<p>
I hope I don't sound like I'm flaming, but I must admit, my guard is up.<br>
<p>
Nonetheless, my identity does not depend upon what people know about me.<br>
<p>
Anyway, about the issue of democracy. Can we agree that if everyone is<br>
well-informed, the problems which Mark suggested dissipate?<br>
