<i>&gt; &gt; Since most people think that ego is one of the main motivations that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; drives rich people, maybe you could explain how it can do the reverse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Do you think others might have similar problems involving ego?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Ego" in the colloquial sense doesn't usually drive people</i><br>
<i>&gt; forward. Generally, I think it holds them back.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
	When you boil all the bullshit out of it, is not ego simply the notion of<br>
being an individual?<br>
<p>
<p>
 Something made it possible for you to see your life differently.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Probably, you already saw your life differently from the way any of us</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; see our lives.</i><br>
<p>
	Is it possible for an individual to see their life the same way any other<br>
individual sees their own life?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; On many occasions I've had a sudden internal "snap" as I've realized</i><br>
<i>&gt; "you know, that viewpoint that I've held is not just incorrect but</i><br>
<i>&gt; actively damaging to my self interest -- I had better revise my</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking".</i><br>
<p>
	Is this "snap" a euphemism for "insight"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;    If I ever get a chance to reprogram myself, I would put emotions</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  under complete control, so that, when I want, I could turn off the bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  ones, and feel the selected good ones.  </i><br>
<p>
	What prevents you from "reprograming" yourself now?<br>
	Would you consider having a self-activated joy-button connected to your<br>
"feels good" section of the brain?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If everything turns to shit, you're in jail or broke, or whatever, just</i><br>
<i>&gt; amplify the good feelings and what's the difference?</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, what is the difference?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;This is what I would call the "fluidity problem" - you could in</i><br>
principle <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;become or feel anything, so how to avoid getting trapped in an</i><br>
attracting <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;but useless motivational state (100% bliss or a fundamental belief that </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you present state is the ideal state and should never be changed, no </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;matter what)? </i><br>
<p>
	Have you ever experienced 100% Bliss?  Can people experience this state at<br>
will?  Can they go from Bliss to rationality at will?<br>
<p>
In real life many aborigines<br>
<i>&gt; have adapted well to Wester culture, I hear. </i><br>
<p>
	Did you hear that some doctors tell Aborigines to eat only that which they<br>
can hunt and gather and within a few months they regain their health?<br>
<p>
I don't like May's Milieu because it<br>
<i>&gt; seems too pacifistic to survive against more "primitive" societies</i><br>
<i>&gt; without locking them up.  </i><br>
<p>
	Is it possible that one becomes violent when they have run out of ideas?<br>
