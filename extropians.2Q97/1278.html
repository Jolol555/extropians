Perhaps it is because there is an attitude amongst some Extros,<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;much like religious-freaks, that one must believe in the whole package</i><br>
or<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be rejected as a heretic.  Many people embrace parts of the Extro view</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;could embrace more, if they were invited in a non-threatening way.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Certainly they are open to discussion, we have found.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I thought the grounds of extropian belief where an open-mind and the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt; that beliefs aren't forced upon you.  Extro thinking (to me) seems to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; basic, a platform for which to build your own personal concepts of</i><br>
yourself<br>
<i>&gt; and the world around you.  Surely anyone with the attitude that you speak</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; is not extropic at all!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

We must agree with you.  Most of those on this list do have an<br>
"open-questioning mind", like most of the Mystics we have known.  We have<br>
also found what we refer to as the "New-Age Space-Cadets" trying to pass<br>
themselves off as Mystics, but they are generally tolerated at best,<br>
however we usually try to keep a certain distance as they have a tendency<br>
to bring unwarranted scorn about those who embrace Mysticism.<br>
	Many Mystics believe that the human race is evolving, rather rapidly<br>
lately, towards what Extros call transhuman.  They also embrace all that<br>
man does as being "natural" as we come from and are part of nature.  We<br>
have yet to find a good Luddite amongst them. :-)<br>
	We are reading the last of the Mars trilogy "Blue Mars" by Kim Stanley<br>
Robinson.  He obviously favours the Swiss model of Democracy to some<br>
extent.  Have you, or anyone on this list, read these books?  If so, what<br>
do you think about some of the ideas he puts forth as regards<br>
terra-forming, politics...self-government,  and future colonization?<br>
	Is his science sound?  We do not have enough background to know if he is<br>
just making this stuff up or if he actually knows what he is talking<br>
(writing) about.  He seems to have a wealth of information which he shares<br>
in the books though.<br>
