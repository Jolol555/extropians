As far as anyone can tell, the stock market averages move in a random walk.<br>
So they don't alternate up and down decades (as you suggest) nor are they<br>
going to keep going up because of 'momentum' (as the zillions of people<br>
currently putting their life savings into mutual funds seem to believe).<br>
<p>
Technically speaking, the values of the S&amp;P500 (or any other broad market<br>
average) move in a pattern statistically indistinguishable from a biased<br>
Levy flight (which is a particular type of random walk more vulnerable to<br>
massive sudden ups and downs than the usual Gaussian random walk).  The bias<br>
is, fortunately, upward.  This makes stocks a good investment if you're<br>
willing to not get your money back for fifteen or twenty years.  I just<br>
moved $30,000 from real estate into a mutual fund this morning.  Assuming<br>
nothing too drastic happens, I plan to spend that money sometime in the<br>
second quarter of the twenty-first century.<br>
