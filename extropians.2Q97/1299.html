For those who are still skeptical, this from Entomology 133 at U.C. Riverside.<br>
Beware of believing a story entirely false because it has a fantastic<br>
headline.  I practice with National Enquirer, which actually often has quite<br>
mundane stories behind its outrageous cover, occasionally.<br>

follicle mite, Demodex folliculorum (Simon) (Demodicidae)<br>
<p>
Demodicids are mites that live in the sebaceous pores and hair<br>
follicles, usually on the nose, forehead, cheek, and chin. However,<br>
they may inhabit follicles, with or without hair, anywhere on the<br>
body. When "blackheads" are squeezed out of the skin and<br>
examined under the microscope, demodicids are sometimes found,<br>
but there is apparently no evidence that the mites cause the<br>
blackheads. Demodicids have a curious body form the long, striate<br>
abdomen giving them a somewhat wormlike appearance (figure<br>
323). Their legs are mere stumps. They have been found on as many<br>
as 97% and 100% of adults examined in different surveys. Children<br>
and adolescents are seldom infested. Among adults, those with oily<br>
skin or who use cosmetics such as lubricating creams extravagantly<br>
and fail to cleanse the skin properly are the ones particularly subject<br>
to infestation (Ayres and Anderson, 1932; Ayres, 1963; Ayres and<br>
Mihan, 1967; Morgan and Coston, 1964; Coston, 1967). Demodex<br>
folliculorum infests hair follicles and D. brevis Akbulatova infests<br>
sebaceous glands (Desch and Nutting, 1972). Both may be present<br>
on the same individual, but D. folliculorum is the species that has<br>
received the most attention.<br>
<p>
Description and Habits. The mite is less than 0.4 mm long, and<br>
usually escapes notice. Its developmental period is about 14.5 days<br>
(Coston, 1967). Inflammation and secondary infection often result<br>
when a large number of mites congregate in a single follicle. A<br>
Demodex type of acne rosacea or "rosacea-like demodicidosis"<br>
affecting the medial portion of the face is believed to result from<br>
excessive numbers of follicle mites; it disappears rapidly following<br>
the topical application of a suitable antiparasitic medication (Ayres,<br>
1963; Ayres and Mihan, 1967; Morgan and Coston, 1964).<br>
<p>
Bacteria have been located on the bodies of D. folliculorum,<br>
suggesting the potential of this mite as a mechanical transmitter of<br>
disease germs (English et al., 1970).<br>
<p>
The follicle mite can cause an inflammatory condition of the eyelids<br>
called demodex blepharitis. Many mites can be found clinging to or<br>
migrating about on extracted eyelashes. As many as 25 mites have<br>
been seen clinging near the root end of a single eyelash, "packed<br>
together like sardines" (Coston, 1967). The infested eyelashes may<br>
be soggy or waterlogged, and sometimes can be pulled out with<br>
virtually no resistance (English,1971).<br>
