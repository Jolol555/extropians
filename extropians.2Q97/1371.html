Hi there<br>
Lots of talk about index funds.<br>
The S&amp;P 500 will crash through the floor in a nano-replicator world.<br>
Other than land, rare art work etc, what will hold relative value and<br>
probably skyrocket?<br>
I suggest platinum.<br>
Page 433 of Nanosystems says that Platinum(Palladium is even harder to <br>
buy) group metals will be used as catalysts in mechanochemical processes.<br>
1 kilo of Pt will process 10^10 kg but that is at 10^4 cycles/sec, mature <br>
 nano might operate at 10^6 or faster.<br>
There are only 3.3 million oz mined each yr, 2.7 mil from South Africa.<br>
<p>
(Don't buy the South African platinum mining ADRs, they will bail on<br>
them in a nano-world, national wealth at stake, diamonds worthless,<br>
gold useless - if you are an extropian who owns gold coins instead<br>
of platinum, dump em.)<br>
<p>
NYMEX platinum contracts are relatively illiquid.<br>
TOKOM contracts in Japan are more liquid, however, they may block <br>
delivery to foreigners, again for national interests.<br>
I suggest Canadian Maple Leaf or Australian Koala coins. Possibly 1-10 oz<br>
wafers, check the premium.<br>
Email me if you want to know where to buy them.<br>
Even if an nano-replicator needs only 1/100 of an oz, (I don't know<br>
how much is needed, it might take an oz or more), no one will sell it to <br>
you.<br>
I can foresee a nano-world where transactions are paid for by<br>
platinum coated diamondoid cards.<br>
<p>
I know Eugene, Anders and others will say:<br>
There is a cubic kilometer of platinum in the asteroid belt(wild guess).<br>
<p>
But it is there, not here. And who owns that, btw? Is it the first one to<br>
attach a probe to an asteroid owns it? What are the laws? Is it companies <br>
or nations or individuals who can claim asteroid ownership?<br>
Or are the asteroids the property of all Terran citizens, pro-rata?<br>
Experts, please.<br>
<p>
Wars could easily erupt as South Africa and Russia completely forbid<br>
platinum or palladium sales. Invading nano mining probes could scoop<br>
the metal out of the mines, then full-scale nano war erupts plus maybe <br>
nukes.<br>
<p>
The S&amp;P500 or Russell 5000 will probably average 12% (dividends <br>
reinvested) over the next 24 yrs. That will give you $16 for each $1<br>
invested, ignoring taxes.<br>
It is now 2021. You can buy a nano food replicator, the design may<br>
be free if you trade some platinum. Stick a Coke in, disassemble,<br>
reassemble, Coke is free. Coke stock value near zero.<br>
Analyze the Dow stocks. Who is going to eat at Mcdonalds for $10<br>
(3% inflation) when you can eat filet mignon, lobster etc for free? Stock <br>
price near zero.<br>
(Some Big Mac diehards, who, of course, will stick the food in their<br>
replicators)<br>
<p>
Restaurants will charge for service, ambience etc.<br>
<p>
Boeing will be very worried about maglev, above and below ground.<br>
Price of planes manufactured from diamondoid, etc, should crash. Stock <br>
way down.<br>
<p>
You can do the rest yourself.<br>
<p>
Wealthy Extropians buy a couple ozs, it won't break you, and you can<br>
thank me later.<br>
Eugene and other currently financially deprived extropians like me, 1 oz<br>
should be ok for now.<br>
<p>
