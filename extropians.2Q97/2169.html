Hagbard so-called Celine cautions us against anarchy:<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Just look at the world prior to WWI. Treat each country as an</i><br>
<i>	&gt;individual person.</i><br>
<p>
A person with the power to tax, to conscript armies, and generally<br>
to shift the consequences of his actions onto innocent peasants --<br>
okay, got it.  I'm not convinced that this analogy fits my neighbors<br>
well enough to model how they'd behave in anarchy.<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;The history of international relations until WWI is a study in</i><br>
<i>	&gt;anarchy. Accordingly, the history of humanity is the history of war</i><br>
<i>	&gt;between nations in an anarchic  system.</i><br>
<p>
(What has changed since 1914?)<br>
<p>
The history of humanity is a tale of wars because statists write the<br>
history books, and to statists, activity other than war is ignoble.<br>
I prefer to see the history of humanity as a tale of trade and invention.<br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;While I see that it is anarchic, in some sense, to have all people</i><br>
<i>	&gt;contracting singly with all others in order to protect themselves,</i><br>
<i>	&gt;how can this be desirable? You can't make a contract with every</i><br>
<i>	&gt;single person you come into contact with.</i><br>
<p>
Are you acquainted with PGP and the "web of trust" idea?<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
<i>	&gt;But in the U.S. republic, there's nothing one idiot can do in four</i><br>
<i>	&gt;years that the next idiot can't undo in four  years.</i><br>
<p>
When was the last time an official wrong on that level got righted <br>
in only four years?<br>
<p>
Example: It's more than four years since one idiot ordered an invasion <br>
of Panama (killing a couple of thousand Panamenhos) because Pineapple Face <br>
had outlived his usefulness.  Has the new idiot given any sign of repudiating <br>
such adventures?<br>
