<i> &gt; When I say it is "the information processed that counts" I don't mean</i><br>

<p>
Very convenient to hinge everything on differences you cannot<br>
define.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Communicating with others is not actually necessary in the sense that</i><br>
<i> &gt; THEY have to hear YOU. It's enough if you listen.</i><br>
<p>
I wasn't using the word "communication" in such a one-sided sense.<br>
I intended the word to cover both receptive and transmittive<br>
communication. Something you might have picked up on if you had<br>
your receivers pumped up as high as your transmitters are.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Posthuman entities, if there are several ones and no collective (whereas</i><br>
<i> &gt; I consider the latter possibility as more likely) will need to talk to</i><br>
<i> &gt; each other to get results. But they will not demand money for them,</i><br>
<i> &gt; because whenever they give knowledge, they don't lose it.</i><br>
<p>
This would be very nice if it were possible to carry out computation<br>
without any energy and without any physical substrate. Unfortunately,<br>
it is not, so information is not the *only* scarce resource. I do<br>
understand that pretending it is simplifies your worldview vastly,<br>
but I try to keep my weltanschauung as simple as possible, and no<br>
simpler.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; When I give you an apple, I don't have the apple anymore. But when I</i><br>
<i> &gt; tell you about the principles of quantum mechanics (for instance) I</i><br>
<i> &gt; don't lose anything but I can only win (from a universal viewpoint: the</i><br>
<i> &gt; more people know about it, the more probable it is that new discoveries</i><br>
<i> &gt; will be made soon). That's why trade in the sense of "give and take"</i><br>
<i> &gt; loses its value.</i><br>
<p>
When you give me an apple and I give you an orange, and this happens<br>
voluntarily, then you have an orange (which you prefer to an apple)<br>
and I have an apple (which I prefer to an orange).  We both benefit,<br>
positive sum game, and furthermore because our act (a transaction)<br>
has infinitesimally affected the market price of apples and oranges,<br>
we have anonymously transmitted some information to the world about<br>
our relative preferences for apples and oranges. There's an<br>
information-communication feat very difficult to pull off reliably<br>
in an engineered system.<br>
<p>
As for the rest, it sounds like an argument against institutions<br>
of intellectual property such as copyrights, patents, and trademarks,<br>
and I've already expressed my doubts about such restrictions on<br>
information exchange in this forum previously. I can't think of<br>
any good way to refute Lee Daniel Crocker's arguments on this point.<br>
Right now, I think it's a bit theoretical, since gummints are still<br>
running around shooting, bombing, and kidnapping people for even<br>
more obviously innocent actions than giving someone a "free" copy<br>
of some Microsoft product.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; &gt;  &gt; Not infinite power, but infinite knowledge is probably the</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt;  &gt; purpose of any such entity.</i><br>
<p>
<i> &gt; &gt; Can you explain to us what the difference between these two</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; things is? Or are you engaging in empty rhetoric?</i><br>
<p>
<i> &gt; It's not just rhetorics. When I want to achieve power, I usually measure</i><br>
<i> &gt; my goal with what I know _now_. For example, "I want to rule the world".</i><br>
<i> &gt; And when I want to achieve power I usually don't want to possess it, but</i><br>
<i> &gt; to USE it -- against other people, other entities or whatever. This</i><br>
<i> &gt; seems entirely unlikely to me for a posthuman behaviour, for it destroys</i><br>
<i> &gt; valuable information sources.</i><br>
<p>
<i> &gt; When I want to achieve knowledge, I want to know things I don't already</i><br>
<i> &gt; know. I want to find NEW things. And I want to possess knowledge, not</i><br>
<i> &gt; for the use against others, just for the possession in itself.</i><br>
<p>
You claim that you have no interest whatsoever in making any use<br>
of knowledge?<br>
<p>
Don't you want to use your knowledge to help all the poor and<br>
suffering people on this planet?<br>
<p>
I hope that the above two questions have made it clear that you<br>
have yet to adequately explain the difference between knowledge<br>
and power, and that you have yet to adequately defend yourself<br>
from the charge of using empty rhetoric. If you expect me to<br>
believe that you do not seek to ever use any of the knowledge<br>
you obtain (for instance, you will not use your knowledge in<br>
order to obtain more knowledge), I'll hope you'll pardon me in<br>
saying that I'm just not that gullible.<br>
<p>
What you want is power to help the poor and suffering: stop<br>
pretending otherwise. You mean to rule wisely and well, but you<br>
mean to rule.<br>
