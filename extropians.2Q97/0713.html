No, the photons are unchanged, the filter just reduces their number.<br>

You can't change the amplitude (color) of a photon, the energy of a photon  <br>
in a vacuum is determined by its wavelength and nothing else.<br>
               <br>
If a beam of light is polarized at 0 degrees and you set your polarizer at <br>
X degrees then the number of photons in the beam will be reduced by  <br>
[cos(X)]^2, for 45 degrees that is 50%. For an individual photon there is a <br>
50% chance it will make it through and a 50% chance it will not, if it does <br>
make it through the amplitude has not been changed at all, if fact nothing at<br>
all about the photon has been changed because it has ALWAYS been polarized at <br>
exactly  45%. I don't claim this is a sensible way to run a universe, but it <br>
has been conformed experimentally, some call it "Quantum Weirdness".<br>
               <br>
Some atoms produce 2 photons of the same polarization but traveling in <br>
opposite directions, so if you measure the polarization of one you know the <br>
polarization of the other. A billion years before I was born somebody in the <br>
Virgo Cluster started making pairs of such photons that have identical but<br>
unknown polarization. He sent one stream of photons to the earth, a billion <br>
light years away, he sent another stream of photons to the Coma cluster in <br>
the opposite direction from the earth a billion and one light years away. <br>
A billion years later on Earth I spin my polarizer to a random direction,  <br>
record the position, observe if the photon made it through the detector or not <br>
(a 50, 50 chance) then record that too. Now I spin the polarizer again and do <br>
the same thing for the next photon (again a 50, 50 chance) and then for the  <br>
next several thousand photons. I know that a year from now a friend of mine <br>
in the Coma Cluster will perform the exact same experiment on his stream of <br>
photons and I decide to visit him. I get in a space ship with my records and <br>
blast off for the Coma Cluster at 99% of the speed of light.<br>
               <br>
After 2 billion years I arrive in the Coma Cluster and compare notes with my   <br>
friend. I notice that the direction I had my polarizer turned to and the <br>
direction my friend had his turned to were different, not very surprising  <br>
since both were picked at random, but then I find something astounding,   <br>
the square of the cosign of the angle between the 2 detectors for each photon  <br>
is proportional to the probability that a photon will make it through my   <br>
friend's detector.<br>
<p>
I have instantly changed something that is 2 billion light years away and was   <br>
made long before dinosaurs walked the earth. Pretty weird. Unfortunately this   <br>
effect can not be used for faster than light communication because before I   <br>
arrived with my records the results of my friends experiment looked random  <br>
to him, it's only when he compared his results with my records, and that can  <br>
only be done at the speed of light or less, did it become obvious that <br>
turning my polarizer and observing the results instantly changed his photons <br>
far away. Nevertheless this does have a practical benefit, you can use it to <br>
make a communication link that is absolutely secure, it's already been done <br>
and not just in the lab. Recently two banks in Switzerland used Quantum <br>
Cryptography to send secure financial data to each other.<br>
