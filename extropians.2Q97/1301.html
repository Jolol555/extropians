Well, if you have an object that is emitting a jet of radiation from one<br>
or both of its poles, or say, a pulsar with a rotating beam. THe object<br>
explodes or implodes for some reason. Say a neutron star hits another<br>
neutron star. At least one of these neutron stars is just below the<br>
threshold to be a black hole. When they hit, the combined mass tips over<br>
the limit to become a singularity, and they implode in a huge gush of<br>
radiation. THere are bound to be some wild warping and tearing of<br>
spacetime as these two rotating bodies merge. Additionally, a neutron<br>
star is not pure neutronium. It usually has a decently thick crust of<br>
material, typically denser than iron, as such elements have a negative<br>
fusion energy balance. A huge rush of radiation from the implosion would<br>
instantly fission, fuse, and possibly totally annihilate a large portion<br>
of the crust material, creating even more radiation, while the remainder<br>
would expand in a hugely flourescent cloud which will form a nebula,<br>
slowly dimming over time as it expands.<br>
