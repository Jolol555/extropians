<i>&gt; I believe the distinction between science fiction and science fantasy </i><br>
<i>&gt; may have begun with George Lucas.</i><br>
<p>
  I suspect it is more of an historical coincidence that for a long<br>
time, most fantasy was either set in low-tech worlds, or in settings<br>
in which technology played little overt part in development of the<br>
story, while most science fiction had no fantasy element.  One major<br>
detail seems to be that many of the major early shapers of the field<br>
were science and technology enthusiasts (Verne, Wells, Gernsback).<br>
Once that restriction is lifted, many alternatives become possible:<br>
Lucas-style science fantasy is one of them, but there are a number of<br>
stories which more nearly resemble traditional magical fantasy which<br>
have substantial hard-science underpinnings.  I remember a<br>
conversation with Katherine Kurtz, for example, in which she described<br>
what the genes were that controlled the ability to acquire magical<br>
power in her "Deryni" series, and how they were inherited, and how<br>
that affected the plot development of her first several books.<br>
