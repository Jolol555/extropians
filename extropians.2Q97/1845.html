<i>&gt; Anders, you are not so disarmingly critical as many of our male list members,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but Anders, you are also an artist, as I am, and the realm of play and</i><br>
<i>&gt; creativity is COMFORTABLE to us...  not so for many of our more critical,</i><br>
<i>&gt; high focus friends...</i><br>
<p>
What can be done to forever kill off this evil, dangerous, and slanderous<br>
meme that scientific rigor isn't beautiful?  The idea that there is a<br>
conflict between rational thought and creativity is common in our<br>
culture, but anyone who is capable of both knows what hogwash it is.<br>
This idea must be rooted out and exposed before it kills off the<br>
future of rational thought in future generations.<br>
<p>
Are the stars less wonderous to me because I understand nuclear fusion?<br>
Is a rose less beautiful because I understand how a high-phosphorous<br>
fertilizer and a good drip system made it that way?  Is a Feynman<br>
lecture any less a great work of art than a Wagner opera?  Who are you<br>
to ridicule the intense beauty I find in an argument as finely crafted<br>
as any Michaelangelo sculpture?<br>
<p>
I /am/ an artist, dammit, and not because I have a few silly poems on<br>
my web page, but because I see the beauty in a mathematical proof, the<br>
inspiring integrity of a rigorous philosphical argument, the fine<br>
craftsmanship of a good statistical analysis, the impact of a carefully<br>
tuned paragraph.  I pity those who only see art in trinkets of shape<br>
and color when the true miracles of the human mind are so much more<br>
powerful and further-reaching.<br>
