<p>
I'm personally quite fond of good rhetoric, and agree that it is an <br>
useful tool. In a way it is a way of enhancing one's communication with a <br>
person (not just for persuasion). But this is also its main danger: it is <br>
the perfect tool for memes too, since they thrive on powerful <br>
communication and persuasion between people. So sacred cows (memes that <br>
secretly link to strong emotions for selfish reasons) of course thrive on <br>
and use rhetoric a lot. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I hope we will be able to remedy that in the near future. People are </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; ant-like) and of course the evolution of cooperation. It would be </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interesting (and probably only a matter of time) to study a more </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; realistic model where different social structures could be tested. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Simulations support reason, at least when everyone is allowed to test </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; them and their basic assumptions are known.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That would be marvellous.  Axelrod's original result was quite stirring,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and more complex ones would be a great accomplishment. </i><br>
<p>
I found one interesting article in Technology Review about current <br>
research in this direction, with applications in sociology and economics. <br>
See <br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Suggestion: why not explain this clearly and logically in a way (say) a </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ten-year old could understand, and then let your opponent put forth his </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; model in the same simple way. Then we can start analyzing what reason </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tells us (but don't forget history; reason isn't always right). </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Many others have done a far better job of that than I, and I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; little patience to debate what I consider "basics" of libertarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought.  I'm more interested in the contentious fringes: intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt; property law, origination of rights, perpetuities and covenants,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and so on.  Debating whether schools should be private or public is</i><br>
<i>&gt; about as interesting to me as it would be for a physics professor to</i><br>
<i>&gt; debating whether heavy things fall faster than light things. </i><br>
<p>
I see your point. But if no physics professors show people that heavy and<br>
light things fall at the same acceleration, then misunderstandings will<br>
flourish and the gulf between the people who know and the people who<br>
doesn't know will widen. I have the feeling this occurs a lot when it<br>
comes to libertarian politics: the people who understand it take it for<br>
granted, and can't understand why so many other people regard it as<br>
lunatic fringe. <br>
<p>
Of course, this list is not intended for discussions of the basics <br>
either, but I really think it would be helpful if somebody could create <br>
clear and logical explanations of the basics (say as a website). <br>
