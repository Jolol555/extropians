I'm not trying to shirk responsibility here; if I don't take charge<br>
of my own world, how will I get what I want?  However, your statement<br>
seems to suggest that I have a lot more control over who gets elected<br>
than I think I do.  Keeping in mind that there are many important things<br>
to deal with in the scientific and social realms, do you have any insights<br>
about how I might increase my influence over who is elected to a meaningful<br>
level?<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Will<br>
