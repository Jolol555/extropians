Today I spent most of my time reading front to back Damien Broderick's<br>
new novel _The_White_Abacus_. For those of you on the list who have not<br>
read it, I recommend that you do so as one of your leisure priorities.<br>
Here are my impressions.<br>
<p>
I stopped into the Dartmouth Bookstore in Hanover today, and was<br>
browsing the SF shelves when I spotted _The_White_Abacus_, a title I had<br>
just read about from Damien's past posts to the list. Hey! A book by<br>
someone I "know". For $12.95, it was pricey for a paperback, but hell,<br>
what are freinds for. ;)<br>
<p>
After purchasing the book along with this quarter's issue of 2600<br>
magazine, _Time_Station_Paris_ by David Evans, and<br>
_Partisan:_Hostile_Takeover_#2_ by S. Andrew Swann, I strolled up the<br>
street to The Dirt Cowboy for a double latte, and sat down to read TWA. <br>
<p>
The first several pages went a bit slow as I shifted my perspective to<br>
grow comfortable with the lingusitic conventions and slang of the<br>
milieu. I didn't catch on to the parallels to Hamlet until the death of<br>
the protagonists father, following which, the various character's<br>
allegorical names helped me sort out the story based on the Shakespeare.<br>
The one part I found I most enjoyed was that while Hamlet was a true<br>
anti-hero, snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory, Damiens<br>
protagonist, Telmah, is Hamlet's mirror more than in name.<br>
<p>
At the same time, Damien weaves a future universe of very extropic<br>
transhuman means, equal to that of Dan Simmon's Hyperion novels, though<br>
in a thousand pages less. The pace more closely resembles that of<br>
_Fall_of Hyperion_ in its suspense, rather than the plodding sloth of<br>
_Hyperion_ that parallels _The_Canterbury_Tales. Brodericks<br>
understanding of both physics and philosophy, their DMZ, and the facets<br>
of the archetypal oedipal conflict make for  a seamless dialogue with<br>
the reader.<br>
<p>
One plot hole which was evident in my mind seems to be a false construct<br>
to justify the existence of the authoritarian belter culture. The<br>
belters still hang onto belief in the immortal soul (and base some<br>
technology on the same) and refuse to use the hex teleportation gates<br>
due to a beleif that their souls become separated from their bodies<br>
through use of such technology. THus they are stuck using plain old<br>
reaction propulsion technology, which limits them to the solar system,<br>
while the hex civilization has spread across the galaxy. WHile this is a<br>
necessary construct, it seems to me that the very physics that enable<br>
hex technology also enable development of Alcubierre Warp technology, a<br>
means of traveling at hyper-relativistic rates relative to non-local<br>
space while remaining within the bounds of relativity. As such a<br>
technology would not require a dissociation of body from "soul", as the<br>
body remains corporate within the local frame of reference, the belter<br>
society would thus not become insular and stunted as it is in TWA.<br>
<p>
Beyond this, which I imagine would not be evident to any but a few<br>
readers, I found the book so gripping and fun that I only stopped once,<br>
in the middle, to travel back to Lebanon, where I finished the book over<br>
lunch.<br>
<p>
My only question left answered/unanswered is: Where are the<br>
extraterrestrials in this galaxy?<br>
