I would like some ideas,discussion, and advice from fellow Extropians.  <br>
<p>
I'm unemployed (whee!) and casually looking around for the next job.  I'd<br>
like to get back into information retrieval, which was my guiding passion a<br>
couple years ago, and I'd like to do something that has the biggest<br>
possible impact.  What I don't know is what would be the coolest and most<br>
extropy-enhancing form of information access to get involved with.<br>
<p>
Let me give a few examples that I've thought of:<br>
	* Help people finding the right product or service to buy.<br>
	* Improve access to scientific information/studies<br>
	* Combine information access with decision support tools<br>
	* Improve tools for argumentation<br>
	* Idea markets<br>
	* Improve interfaces for today's consumer search services (conveniently,<br>
I'm interviewing for a position at one of them)<br>
	* Improve interfaces for high-end search engines (like Verity or Inktomi)<br>
<p>
What else is out there that I haven't heard about?  Which of them is the<br>
most leveraged way to increase the effectiveness of information?  What<br>
problem is out there that just needs a bit of a push for a huge benefit?<br>
<p>
Now, my skills are information and user interface design, design<br>
management, and Web technologies.  I'm not much of a programmer, so going<br>
for pure algorithm or engine design probably won't work for me.  But if you<br>
tell me about any cool ideas or technologies, I'll try to figure out a way<br>
to get involved.<br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>
