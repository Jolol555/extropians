<i>&gt;I like the idea of required community service.</i><br>

<p>
!! Which is pretty bad!<br>
<p>
However, there is a difference: school is at least ostensibly for the<br>
benefit of the student.  "Service" is for the benefit of others.  So<br>
its message is that one has a duty to serve others as *they* see fit,<br>
and that's even worse than the message of compulsory schooling (that<br>
one should let others decide what one should learn).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I believe the Extropians, on the whole, seriously lack an appreciation</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the importance of an individual's obligation to the community.</i><br>
<p>
Those libertarians among us (probably the ones you're thinking of)<br>
have a *very* serious idea of an individual's obligation to the community,<br>
and where that obligation ends.  I'm obliged to peacefully coexist with<br>
others, and that is it, period.  I think you who fail to appreciate<br>
everyone's obligation *not* to impose (whether individually or as groups)<br>
on others.  By approving compusory service, you are being a bad citizen.<br>
You are failing to treat your community with the respect you owe it.<br>
<p>
Each person deserves respect as an individual, and has the right<br>
to *choose* his or her connections--or disconnections-- with others.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No man is an island.</i><br>
<p>
That's a reminder, a piece of advice, to each person.<br>
It's *not* a compusion to follow someone else's idea of service.<br>
I wonder whether the author [Bartlett's fails me] would approve<br>
your use of that line.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Anyone who calls community service "servitude" doesn't know what the</i><br>
<i>&gt;word means.</i><br>
<p>
And vice versa.  Let's not confuse slavery with true service.<br>
The main question is whether one's service is voluntary or not.  An<br>
additional question is, who is being served?  The actual community or<br>
an organization that happens to claim to represent the community?<br>
Who is deciding what form "service" should take?<br>
<p>
I believe compulsory associations make people into enemies and<br>
destroy true community.  I can't thank you for promoting that.<br>
