<p>
The idea of all things having cause and effect is flawed, of course.  You're<br>
always going to end up with a first cause, and who knows what caused it!?<br>
 But nothing you could observe after that initial cause is random.  I would<br>
also argue that the initial cause was not random, because I don't believe<br>
that random events exist.<br>

the  <br>

<i>&gt;          </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Yes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;Why should this be information? </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Why should data on the position and velocity of an atom be information? </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I must not understand the question.</i><br>
<p>
Information can exist on it, but it does not exist until we create that<br>
information, until we percieve it.  As you said "...according to many of the<br>
most popular interpretations of Quantum Mechanics nothing is anything until<br>
it is perceived".  Information only exists on something once we percieve it,<br>
but it exists 'physically'.  Our consciousness is the processor of<br>
information, our soul is the infomation we process, as you said this is the<br>
only important thing to you.<br>
<p>
As you said in earlier post:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The soul as I understand it is something important, the only important thing</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;about me, the only important thing in the universe, is consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
I believe there are two important things about you (and every conscious<br>
being):<br>
<p>
Your physical structure, as created by your genes, which shapes your logic.<br>
 The way you process information (your logic circuits).  We could call this<br>
your consciousness.<br>
<p>
The information you have processed.  Which changes the way you process<br>
information and shapes yourself.  The information you have processed and who<br>
you are can be considered the same thing.  So i'm going to say this is the<br>
soul.<br>
<p>
I believe both of these concepts fall into what you describe as a soul and<br>
consciousness, but in a more direct way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          &gt;If the computer reacts the same as a brain, it is a brain.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I agree.</i><br>
<p>
If a computer processes information, which is an abstract representation of<br>
something physical and alters it's logic according to this information, would<br>
it not be conscious?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If you smother one brain or blow one up with a H Bomb then obviously they </i><br>
<i>&gt;  are no longer the same. My point is that if the information on how my mind</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  operates is put into a computer and then my body is destroyed my </i><br>
<i>&gt;  consciousness does not stop, if two phonographs are synchronized and</i><br>
playing <br>
<i>&gt;  the same symphony and you destroy one machine, the music does not stop.</i><br>
     <br>
<p>
I was just trying to point out that, even if we do not percieve the universe<br>
it can still have effect on us.  If you uploaded your consciouness you would<br>
no longer be conscious because you would no longer have a physical world on<br>
which to accumilate information.  As you said, a brain is nothing without<br>
senses, it is also nothing without something to sense.<br>
<p>
Peoples perceptions of the universe can be very different.  I remember<br>
hearing about a disorder (I forget the name) that makes people 'see' sound.<br>
 For instance, when a dog barks, these people can see triangles coming out of<br>
the dogs mouth.  I wonder what it would be like to hear what you see? or<br>
smell what you touch?<br>
