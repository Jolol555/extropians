The problem is that in many fields it is extremely easy to influence an<br>
experiment with one's preconceptions, and even easier to interpret the<br>
results in the way that fits them (psychology is a wonderful example). <br>
Especially if you have a firm emotional belief about the subject (imagine<br>
that you are a scientist looking at the dangers of a illegal drug or a<br>
scientist looking at the possible side-effects of a vitamin - guess which<br>
scientist is most likely to find chromosome damage?). This is one reason<br>
scientific methodology has to be so strict and conservative: to weed out<br>
observer biases in the long run and retain the facts that remain true<br>
regardless of who sees them. <br>

<i>&gt; We are PART of nature, we grew out of it, we weren't placed here as</i><br>

<i>&gt; language).</i><br>
<p>
Well, in many cases it is convenient and in some cases it is quite <br>
reasonable. Ideally, you should be keenly aware of how you as an observer <br>
influence things and take them into account (if possible), but it doesn't <br>
mean the observer is always significant for the experiment. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, light can be seen as particles or waves, depending on the observors</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumptions, techniques, biases etc. etc.</i><br>
<p>
No, your assumptions won't change light: a photoelectric experiment won't<br>
cease to work just because you don't believe in photons, just as a<br>
two-slit experiment won't work when die hard particle-believers are<br>
present. Both reveal objective facts about reality which shows that both<br>
groups obviously are wrong (the truth is of course simple: light isn't<br>
particles or waves, it is something else that can behave like both). <br>
