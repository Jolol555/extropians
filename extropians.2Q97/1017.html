<i>&gt; From: CALYK@aol.com</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In a message dated 97-05-08 13:24:02 EDT, you write:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; &gt;The only thing better is a noncooked,, organic,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt;living foods diet.  I go for milk too though.  Proper food combining is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt;must too, drink water before eating fruit before veggies before grains.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;You should check up on that.  I've yet to see any scientific references on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;food combining.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;   &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I did, in an excellent book called Fit for Life, written by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; nutritionist/researcher.</i><br>
<p>
Ah yes, the Diamonds (thats the name of the husband and wife team that<br>
wrote that book).<br>
<p>
I've read part of the book in question (my mother had a copy), and<br>
I've also read a bunch of stuff about what they wrote. Suffice it to<br>
say, it doesn't appear that they have any real solid evidence for<br>
their claims, which tend to be somewhat bizarre. Refering to them as<br>
"researchers" would be a stretch -- they did no real original<br>
research, except on their own bodies.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, one could do far worse than following part of their<br>
advice and becoming vegetarian, even if they don't advise doing so for<br>
anything like the correct reasons. Just as you can be cured by<br>
antibiotics even if you believe they are magic that drives out evil<br>
spirits, you can gain advantage from a proper diet even if you do it<br>
for the wrong reasons. The food combining nonsense they spout is<br>
silly, but ultimately harmless even if followed -- at worst, it would<br>
force you to inconveniently juggle what you eat and when.<br>
