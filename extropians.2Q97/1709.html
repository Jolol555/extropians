Hagbard Celine &lt;hagbard@ix.netcom.com&gt; asked in a personal letter,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; (I prefer to call it spiritual stuff)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why do you prefer this?</i><br>
<p>
	Thank you for asking.  I hope you don't mind if I reply to<br>
this publicly since I would love to have much more discussion about<br>
this topic.<br>
<p>
	There are many reason.  First and foremost it seems to me to<br>
be the most natural.  This is a vast "cartoon world" inside our mind<br>
that is everything we know.  At the center of this "cartoon world" is<br>
a representation of ourselves.  It is isomorphically very identical to<br>
our real physical selves and mirrors our physical selves via data<br>
collected by our senses.  Calling this our spiritual selves certainly<br>
sounds much better than calling it a "cartoon" rendition of ourselves.<br>
I've always had troubles with words like "qualia" and such.  People<br>
have no idea what you are talking about when you use those kinds of<br>
words.  A quality is something that is not real, but ideas are very<br>
real and have qualities.  Green is something real that has qualities.<br>
It is these real qualities that give us our ability to consciously<br>
represent information.<br>
<p>
	"Idea" is another word that is used a lot but people confuse<br>
this with more cognitive representations and thoughts or memories than<br>
with something more tangible like color itself.  Too many people<br>
mistakenly think the color green is something beyond your eye on the<br>
surface of a tree and an idea is something in your mind.  They are<br>
both spiritual stuff and everything we consciously know is constructed<br>
of various forms of this stuff inside our heads.<br>
<p>
	Calling it a virtual reality world is also incorrect.  A<br>
virtual reality world is abstract.  It doesn't matter what is doing<br>
the representation.  But in our spirit world red abstractly represents<br>
other things but it itself is not abstract.  It most definitely<br>
matters how it is represented.  In a virtual reality world you can<br>
swap the meaning of one's and zeros (or whatever is doing the actual<br>
physical representation of such) and everything will still act the<br>
same.  But if you swap red and blue you have a very different<br>
conscious spirit world.<br>
<p>
	Further, scientists and philosophers have been avoiding this<br>
"S" word for years now.  I ask why?  This is what has caused the great<br>
divide between scientific thinking and religious thinking.  To me, the<br>
most important goal of science today is to discover what this<br>
substance of ideas is.  What is consciousness made of?  I believe we<br>
are about to discover precisely what this mirracusouls phenomenal<br>
stuff is as Crick argues in his book: "The Astonishing Hypothesis".<br>
This will be the most significant discovery made to date by man.  This<br>
discovery is what will make uploading possible.  For me, it is<br>
precisely the discovery of the spiritual.<br>
<p>
	Realizing that this spirit world exists inside our mind<br>
rationally explains all the "spiritual" phenomenon religious people<br>
claim proves we have a spirit.  Of course it is possible for our<br>
spiritual selves to have an out of body experience in this cartoon<br>
world.  Of course there is phantom limb pain after an amputation.  It<br>
is the spiritual self in our brain which hasn't had it's spirit limb<br>
amputated feeling the phantom pain.  This is real stuff that really<br>
exists just as our physical body exists.  We must call it something.<br>
What is more natural than calling it the spiritual self inside the<br>
spiritual world inside our brain?<br>
<p>
	Anything is possible in this dream world and that is why so<br>
many people have so many experiences that they think are "spiritually<br>
supper natural".  They are spiritual but they are not supper natural.<br>
If people realized that all this was simply occuring in the natural<br>
fantasy spirit world inside our brain and not beyond our brain people<br>
could more rationally think about and understand the significance of<br>
all such occurrences.<br>
<p>
	Also, most people reject the notion of abstract uploading<br>
because deep down they know there is something spiritual inside of us.<br>
What an abstract machine uses to represent red is very different than<br>
what we use to represent red.  True, we will be able to make an<br>
abstract copy of ourselves that has no spirit at all, but this is not<br>
uploading.  It is only abstract simulation.  There is no feeling<br>
involved.  Such would be a zombie that would be lying when it was<br>
trying to describe what the color blue is really like since none of<br>
what it knew would be represented with real blue.  Blue is not some<br>
abstract representation of a particular wavelength of light.  It is<br>
something very phenomenal and real.  It is like something and not<br>
merely abstract.  We must accept the fact that an upload must be to a<br>
similar spiritual platform which uses the same emotional or phenomenal<br>
stuff to consciously represent this particular wavelength of light not<br>
merely any old abstract representation.<br>
<p>
	These are my thoughs on this subject, what do you think?  Do<br>
you fear or wince at the idea of calling it "spiritual" stuff?  If so<br>
then why?<br>
