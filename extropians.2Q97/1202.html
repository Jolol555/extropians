Subject: You are now subscribed to the HTECH-L list<br>
<p>
Sun, 12 Jan 1997 10:16:11<br>
<p>
Your subscription  to the HTECH-L  list (History of Technology  Discussion) has<br>
been accepted.<br>
<p>
Please  save this  message  for future  reference, especially  if  you are  not<br>
familiar with LISTSERV. This might look like  a waste of disk space now, but in<br>
6 months you will be glad you  saved this information when you realize that you<br>
cannot  remember what  are the  lists you  are subscribed  to, or  what is  the<br>
command to  leave the list to  avoid filling up  your mailbox while you  are on<br>
vacations.  In fact,  you  should create  a new  mail  folder for  subscription<br>
confirmation messages  like this one, and  for the "welcome messages"  from the<br>
list owners that  you are will occasionally receive after  subscribing to a new<br>
list.<br>
<p>
To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list, just send<br>
mail to HTECH-L@SIVM.SI.EDU. This is called "sending mail to the list", because<br>
you send mail to a single address  and LISTSERV makes copies for all the people<br>
who  have subscribed.  This address  (HTECH-L@SIVM.SI.EDU) is  also called  the<br>
"list address". You must  never try to send any command to  that address, as it<br>
would be distributed  to all the people who have  subscribed. All commands must<br>
be    sent    to    the   "LISTSERV    address",    LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET    (or<br>
LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU).  It  is  very  important to  understand  the  difference<br>
between the two, but fortunately it is not complicated. The LISTSERV address is<br>
like a  FAX number, and the  list address is like  a normal phone line.  If you<br>
make your  FAX call someone's  regular phone number by  mistake, it will  be an<br>
unpleasant experience for him but you  will probably be excused the first time.<br>
If you  do it regularly,  however, he  will probably get  upset and send  you a<br>
nasty complaint.  It is the same  with mailing lists, with  the difference that<br>
you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time, so a lot more<br>
people get annoyed if you use the wrong number.<br>
<p>
You may leave  the list at any  time by sending a "SIGNOFF  HTECH-L" command to<br>
LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET (or LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU). You  can also tell LISTSERV how<br>
you want it to confirm the receipt of  messages you send to the list. If you do<br>
not trust the system, send a "SET HTECH-L REPRO" command and LISTSERV will send<br>
you a  copy of  your own messages,  so that  you can see  that the  message was<br>
distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a while you may find that<br>
this is  getting annoying, especially  if your mail  program does not  tell you<br>
that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from<br>
HTECH-L. If  you send a "SET  HTECH-L ACK NOREPRO" command,  LISTSERV will mail<br>
you a short acknowledgement instead, which  will look different in your mailbox<br>
directory. With  most mail programs you  will know immediately that  this is an<br>
acknowledgement you can read later.  Finally, you can turn off acknowledgements<br>
completely with "SET HTECH-L NOACK NOREPRO".<br>
<p>
Following instructions from the list owner, your subscription options have been<br>
set  to "REPRO  NOFILES"  rather than  the usual  LISTSERV  defaults. For  more<br>
information  about subscription  options,  send a  "QUERY  HTECH-L" command  to<br>
LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET (or LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU).<br>
<p>
Contributions sent to this list are  automatically archived. You can get a list<br>
of  the available  archive  files  by sending  an  "INDEX  HTECH-L" command  to<br>
LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET (or LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU). You  can then order these files<br>
with  a "GET  HTECH-L LOGxxxx"  command,  or using  LISTSERV's database  search<br>
facilities. Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for more information on the latter.<br>
<p>
Please note  that it is presently  possible for other people  to determine that<br>
you are signed  up to the list  through the use of the  "REVIEW" command, which<br>
returns the e-mail address and name of  all the subscribers. If you do not want<br>
your name to be visible, just issue a "SET HTECH-L CONCEAL" command.<br>
<p>
More information  on LISTSERV commands can  be found in the  LISTSERV reference<br>
card,  which  you  can  retrieve  by  sending  an  "INFO  REFCARD"  command  to<br>
LISTSERV@SIVM.BITNET (or LISTSERV@SIVM.SI.EDU).<br>
