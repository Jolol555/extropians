<i>&gt;I always hear about upcoming movies but with books it seems like</i><br>
<i>&gt;a surprise when I walk into the store.  Is there a more centralized</i><br>
<i>&gt;source for this kind of information?</i><br>
<p>
I strongly suggest building a friendship with the person who actually <br>
orders the science fiction books for your favorite bookstore.  That <br>
person is usually a source of knowledge and opinion on what is <br>
being published, and will usually enjoy the opportunity to share it.  <br>
While many magazines will publish lists or previews of upcoming books <br>
from major authors, what gets in there often depends on who has a <br>
good press agent.  I myself tend to be a bit cynical about the <br>
publishing biz, but it's hard to maintain that when someone I <br>
consider a friend waxes eloquent about the latest Gibson coming <br>
out this year (yes, a new book on the way).  Enthusiasm is <br>
contagious, and I'm keeping a book file of all the recommendations <br>
from this thread (and don't forget Sarah's web site book <br>
recommendation list).<br>
