<i>&gt;From what I have read, most of the larger primates are much stronger</i><br>
than typical human beings.  This makes them difficult to control once<br>
they reach adulthood, and they may not be safe to be around.<br>
<p>
However, small monkeys should be relatively safe as long as they don't<br>
bite.  I saw a TV show last year showing monkeys who were trained to<br>
harvest coconuts from palm trees.  They climb the tree and twist the<br>
nuts around and around until the stem breaks and they fall.  This is<br>
apparently a common harvesting method in some parts of the world.<br>
