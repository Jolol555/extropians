My experience was that I was already sympathetic to many extropian ideas<br>
upon my first exposure.  I was floored by the similarities between myself and<br>
the weirdos in Cali as I flipped though the 10/94 Wired in a grocery<br>
store.  The notion of furthering and accelarating human evolution had been<br>
brewing in me for a few years.  In '93 I wrote a screen play<br>
about a man and his wife who had themselves placed in cryonic supspension.<br>
When they were revived, the plot centered around the man's decision to<br>
have himself up-loaded, and thus evolve into another species (his wife<br>
suffered water damage and had to be uploaded immediately after thawing).<br>
Had I considered that I may make the same journey as my protagonist, as I<br>
do now, the story would have been much better.<br>
<p>
Another important factor in my exposure to extropian memes, was the<br>
industriousness and optimism of the people that Regis wrote about in that <br>
article.  At the time I was at psychological/emotional global minimum.  It<br>
was inspiring to read of people with whom I shared many ideas (though not<br>
totally-- I was an uninformed collectivist at the time, but Ayn Rand took<br>
care of that silliness), and who were producive and happy, two<br>
crucial things I was not at the time.  I'm Much better now ;-).<br>
<p>
Yet another drawing factor was my inclination towards the extraordianry<br>
and weird. Such things very often lead me away from the masses.  Its a<br>
natural tendency I have that I can trace back to the<br>
first grade.  As now I count myself among their ranks, Extropians no longer<br>
seem strange, but we're definately extraordinary!<br>
<p>
So my generic profile would be someone who was already sympathetic to &gt;H<br>
memes, an inclination to leave the pack, and has the desire to be productive. <br>
At least in this stereotype, a potential &gt;H already has the neural<br>
architecture that such memes thrive in.  <br>
<p>
On a side note, I wonder if a healthy human gene pool contains a handful<br>
of alleles that incline their bodies/brains toward novelty.  Such<br>
individuals may have just enough reproductive success to keep novelty<br>
seeking alleles in a populations genome, and just enough creativity to<br>
introduce new technologies/memes (at the risk of ostracism (sp?)) that<br>
would increase their fitness either directly, or indirectly by helping the<br>
group. Considering how long hominids used the same tools, such a novelty gene <br>
would probably be a relative newcomer (past 100K yrs?).  Just a thought.<br>
<p>
Exovivo!<br>
