						Or both.<br>
<p>
	The Sovereign would use the "we".  Any who must answer to the Sovereign<br>
would use the personal pronoun "I".  Heads of State, while representing the<br>
sovereign territory, would use the "we".  The Pope would use the "we". <br>
When one recognizes their own Sovereignty, they would use the "we".  When<br>
you are a Master in fact and not just in empty title (Mr.) you answer only<br>
to yourself.  For such a one, to intervene in the willful acts of another<br>
would be an act of war, as would the intervention by another entity.<br>
	Multi personality describes all human beings.  Those with Multi<br>
Personality Disorder, are believed to have too few personalities.  What is<br>
commonly called our personality is but a collage of masks (L. persona) <br>
When one recognizes they operate behind various persona, they begin to<br>
examine them, and they begin to live more consciously.  They begin to act,<br>
rather than react.  They act with, and are masters of their emotions.	They<br>
act with, and are masters of their passion, They act with, and are masters<br>
of their personalities.<br>
	The third possibility.....+Oh dear, don't tell him!+....§Shut up!  Why<br>
must you aways "INTERVENE?"§....*"ALWAYS ?*.....çWhy can't we just live in<br>
peace and joy?ç....&amp;Get real, for god's sake?&amp;....#1Could you all just keep<br>
it down to a low roar.   We are attempting to communicate with the humans,<br>
and you know how much we have to lower our energy to facilitate the<br>
operation.  We would appreciate your cooperation, okay + ?....+Okay, but<br>
don't tell him everything.+....<br>
#1 And you §, can we expect you to not react for a few more<br>
minutes?#1....§No problem, I didn't start it, you know?§...#1Of course. <br>
And *, ç, and &amp;, can we also count on you?#1....*Yeah.*....çCount me<br>
in.ç....&amp;Okay.&amp;....#1Thank you, thank you so much.#1............hmmmmm<br>
where were we?....oh,...yes!<br>
	The third possibility is a desire by the writer to provoke the<br>
convention-oriented, like moths to a flame....reaction.<br>
<p>
	On a personal note (peeking around the masks)....Isn't T.A.N.S.T.A.A.F.L.<br>
a chapter title in the "Moon is a Harsh Mistress" ?  On the moon that might<br>
be true.  It certainly has not proven true in our own experiences...unless<br>
one gets real picky about "free".  If picking the food up and eating it is<br>
considered "free", making dumpster raids behind Pizza Hut would be an<br>
example of a free lunch.<br>
	In the town (40,000) next to our village (1,000) they are having their<br>
annual Spring-Cleaning-Bring-and-Take event (Roughly translated).  The<br>
stadium is used and people bring all their uneeded stuff.  It is put on the<br>
benches and on the ground and on tables for three days.   (Wed., Thu.,<br>
Fri.)  On Saturday, everybody can come and take away whatever they want,<br>
gratis.  It is promoted by the city, sponsored by local businesses, and<br>
supported enthusiastically by the community.  It is like a giant swap meet<br>
where everything is free.  Those in need CAN be served in an honorable way.<br>
 Coercive taking and proof-of-need play no part in this event, thus<br>
avoiding dishonor to any one.<br>

*Can someone figure out how many calories are burnt with different types of<br>
thoughts; i.e. sexual, problem solving, kind, angry, fearful, etc.?<br>
