<i>&gt;The brilliance of these people lies not in their product (what</i><br>

<i>&gt;ultimate end of all human societal interaction. I see us here every day</i><br>
<i>&gt;debating how mankind may finally have power over his fate. The notion of</i><br>
<i>&gt;extropy is a power-hungry invention. Dammit, we *CAN* be what we want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be! This is arrogance, this is claiming power, and this I love.</i><br>

"... seen as the result of human endeavour, of human dreams, hopes, pass-<br>
ions, and most of all, as the result of the most admirable union of creative<br>
imagination and rational critical thought, I should like to write 'Science'<br>
with the biggest capital 'S' to be found in the printer's upper case.<br>
<p>
  "Science is not only like art and literature, an adventure of the human<br>
spirit, but it is among the creative arts perhaps the most human: full of<br>
human failings and shortsightedness, it shows those flashes of insight<br>
which open our eyes to the wonders of the world and of the human spirit.<br>
But this is not all. Science is the direct result of that most human of all<br>
human endeavours - to liberate ourselves. It is part of our endeavour to see<br>
more clearly, to understand the world and ourselves, and to act as adult,<br>
responsible and enlightened beings. 'Enlightenment', Kant wrote, 'is the<br>
emancipation of man from self-imposed tutelage . . . from a state of in-<br>
capacity to use his own intelligence without external guidance.  Such a<br>
state of tutelage I call "self-imposed" if it is due not to any lack of<br>
intelligence but the lack of courage or determination to use one's own<br>
intelligence instead of relying upon a leader.  *Sapere Aude!*  Dare to use<br>
your own intelligence! This is the maxim of the enlightenment.' [ref. 6, <br>
'Was ist Aufklarung?']<br>
<p>
<p>
  "Kant challenges us to use our intelligence instead of relying upon a<br>
leader, upon an authority. This should be taken as a challenge to<br>
reject even the scientific expert as a leader, or even *science itself*<br>
Science has no authority. It is not the magical product of the given,<br>
the data, the observations. It is not a gospel of truth. It is the result<br>
of our own endeavours and mistakes. It is you and I who make science,<br>
as well as we can. It is you and I who are responsible for it...<br>
<p>
<p>
  "The nuclear bomb (and possibly also the so-called 'peaceful use of<br>
atomic [fission - TH] energy' whose consequences may be even worse in the<br>
long run) have, I think, shown us the shallowness of the worship of science<br>
as an 'instrument' of our 'command over nature' or the 'control of our <br>
physical environment': it has shown us that this command, this control, is <br>
apt to be self-defeating, and apt to enslave us rather than to make us <br>
free - if it does not do away with us altogether. And while knowledge is <br>
worth dying for, power is not. (Knowledge is one of the few things that <br>
are worth dying for, together with liberty, love, kindness, and helping <br>
those who are in need of help)."<br>
