Hmm.  Your comment provokes several reactions.<br>
<p>
The first is due to the fact that my wife and I are expecting a boy in <br>
mid-September.  This obviously places both of us in the category of <br>
moron, at least according to you.  So I'd like to think that my example <br>
disproves your blanket statement right off the bat ;-)<br>
<p>
Digging beyond the gut-level response, I'll admit that I had reservations <br>
for many years about bringing a child into the world.  Look around - the <br>
forces of big government seem to be entrenched around the world, children <br>
are being shot on the streets and in schools, couples are having to work <br>
harder to make ends meet, etc.  I could go on and on.  It seems like the <br>
world is going down the toilet, and that things just aren't as good as <br>
they were when I was growing up.<br>
<p>
At some point, though, I began to suspect that these views were primarily <br>
due to my getting older, that the big bad world was making me cynical, <br>
and that maybe the world wasn't actually getting measurably worse.  I <br>
also began to suspect that perhaps most parents of most generations, for <br>
as far back as mankind has been living in civilized society, have felt <br>
that things wouldn't be as good for their children as they were when they <br>
themselves were growing up.<br>
<p>
So now I try to invoke my Extropian dynamic optimism.  Yes, things are <br>
bad in many ways in many places, but there are also many good <br>
developments being made at a seemingly increasing pace.  Yes, I'm <br>
throwing myself and my child into a bit of a crapshoot, but I have hope <br>
that the forces of freedom and scientific advancement will prevail.<br>
<p>
Here's a counter-argument for you.  If forward-thinking types like us <br>
don't counter the reproductive forces of the moronic masses, at least to <br>
some degree, aren't we just making it more certain that those forces will <br>
prevail?  Who knows, my kid could be the next Max More!<br>
<p>
There's the other line of discussion about whether or not one can best <br>
achieve immortality through one's genes or one's memes.  In other words, <br>
how much is one limiting one's advancement and personal development by <br>
settling down into family life?  I struggled with this one too, and have <br>
come to the conclusion that I want to have, and think I can accomodate, <br>
both.  I know that I have developed quite a bit by being married, and I <br>
expect that being a father will offer many new opportunities to grow.  So <br>
I'll hopefully end up being a better, more effective person, and will be <br>
bringing a potential new Extropian into the world to boot.<br>
<p>
Along those lines, does anyone have any suggestions for how to raise a <br>
successful, Extropian child?  Are there any particularly good books, web <br>
sites, etc. out there?<br>
