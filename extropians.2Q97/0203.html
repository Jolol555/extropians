<i>&gt;&gt;From:ahale@nmsu.edu (Alan Hale)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Subject: an open letter from Alan Hale</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Organization: NMSU Astronomy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Newsgroups: sci.astro.amateur</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;An open letter to the scientists of my generation:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I am Alan Hale, the co-discoverer of Comet Hale-Bopp which, as I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sure you're aware, is getting a tremendous amount of media attention</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;at this time. Like I'm sure is true for many of you, I was inspired</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by the scientific discoveries and events taking place during my childhood</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to pursue a career in science only to find, after completing the rigors</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of undergraduate and graduate school, that the opportunities for us</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to have a career in science are limited at best and are which I usually</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;describe as "abysmal." Based upon my own experiences, and those of you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;with whom I have discussed this issue, my personal feeling is that,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;unless there are some pretty drastic changes in the way that our society</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;approaches science and treats those of us who have devoted our lives to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;making some of our own contributions, there is no way that I can, with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a clear conscience, encourage present-day students to pursue a career</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in science. It really pains me a great deal to say something like that,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;but I feel so strongly about this that I have publicly made this</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;statement at almost every opportunity I have been given.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I am trying to use the media attention that is currently being focused</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;upon me to raise awareness of this state of affairs, and perhaps start</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to effect those changes that will allow me to convey a more positive</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;message to the next generation. So far, I'm sensing a certain reluctance</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;among the media to discuss this issue, as they seem far more interested</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in items which I consider to be irrelevant and unimportant. But I intend</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to keep hammering away at this, and I'd like to believe that eventually</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;some are going to sit up and take notice. I am also attempting to schedule</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;meetings with some of our government leaders, to see if I can at least</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;get some acknowledgement from Washington that this is a problem that needs</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to be dealt with.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;My reason for writing to you is to ask your help. I know that I'm not alone</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in being frustrated about the current prospects for pursuing any kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;decent career within science, and I'm quite sure that many of you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"horror stories" about your searches for decent employment that are quite</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;similar to my own. I'd like to hear them. I'd especially like to hear from</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;those of you who are on your second or third or fourth post-doc, or who</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;have left the field as a result of the employment situation, or who have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;experienced severe personal difficulties (e.g., break-up of a marriage,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;etc.). I realize that some of these might be painful to discuss, but I'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;like to show that we are not a bunch of impersonal statistics, but that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;we're human beings trying to make an honest living and perhaps make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;contribution or two to society while we're at it. Speaking of statistics,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;though, if you received any information about the numbers of applicants to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;some of the positions you applied to -- which was often a 3-digit number</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in my case -- I'd like to hear that, too.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Please e-mail your stories to me at ahale@nmsu.edu, with a subject line of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;"horror stories" or something like that. Please let me know if you would</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;prefer to remain anonymous when I share these stories with the press and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the government. Also, please pass this message on to any of your friends</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and colleagues who might be interested in sharing their stories with me, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;keep in mind that I would like to receive stories from as many scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;disciplines as possible. (Because of the amount of e-mail traffic I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;receiving these days, along with everything else that's going on, I probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;won't be able to acknowledge each message individually.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you. Perhaps, with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;opportunity we have before us right now, we have the chance to make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;difference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Sincerely,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Alan Hale</i><br>
