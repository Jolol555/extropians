} Here's an interesting question:<br>
} What happens when your star technical witness tells others she's no longer <br>
} your witness at all?<br>
} Denning now says she has doubts...<br>
} <br>
} (Responses? I'm no longer on cypherpunks, so mail me directly.<br>

} Administration Supporter Having Second Thoughts On Encryption Plan<br>
} <br>
} By Will Rodger 1:30 PM EDT<br>
} <br>
} Nixon went to China. Constantine converted to Christianity. Napoleon crowned <br>
} himself emperor.<br>
} <br>
} So why can't Dorothy Denning be a cypherpunk?<br>
} <br>
} That's the question encryption mavens ask as the Georgetown University <br>
} computer scientist slowly lets the word out: She won't back government plans <br>
} for key recovery, key escrow or anything else alleged to increase national <br>
} security until backers show that the benefits of controls on encryption <br>
} outweighs those of letting free market forces govern its use.<br>
} <br>
} That's a far cry from the way she once talked about encryption technology. As <br>
} recently as this year Denning was pegged as a strong backer of keeping <br>
} controls on a wide range of computer-security products.<br>
} <br>
} "Maybe export controls should be lifted," Denning said. "But I'm not saying <br>
} that all controls should be lifted. I've gotten into a state where I don't <br>
} know and I'm not sure that I ever knew."<br>
} <br>
} Denning may be the only prominent cryptographer to support government control <br>
} of encryption technology, the underlying technology behind nearly all <br>
} Internet security devices that scramble information so even the wiliest <br>
} hacker is powerless to decode it. As the author of the first widely read <br>
} textbook on the subject, her opinion carries weight with at least some in the <br>
} encryption community.<br>
} <br>
} Since encryption can be used to defeat lawful wiretaps and other electronic <br>
} searches and seizures, Denning backed law enforcement as it tried to fight <br>
} encryption's spread abroad.<br>
} <br>
} But now a host of objections to the Clinton administration's plan have turned <br>
} the argument on its head. As the Internet becomes more popular for business <br>
} use, encryption is more important than ever to keep hackers out. And a recent <br>
} cryptographer's report suggesting that it would be far riskier to give <br>
} governments spare keys to decode messages in a few places than not to have <br>
} third party access at all has clearly shaken Denning's confidence.<br>
} <br>
} Policy specialists in Washington and elsewhere have speculated that Denning <br>
} would announce something soon, but none wants to push her for fear of <br>
} alienating someone who could end up a potent ally.<br>
} <br>
} "I don't think any close scientific observer of this debate can deny that <br>
} there are real technical concerns raised by the Administration's position," <br>
} said Alan Davidson, counsel with the Center for Democracy and Technology.<br>
} <br>
} "I think its just best for us to sit back and not say anything at this <br>
} point," added another prominent activist. "We don't want to force her hand."<br>
} <br>
} Will Denning go over to the other side?<br>
} <br>
} "I'm not advocating anything anymore," Denning said. "I support what the <br>
} administration is doing because I really see them struggling with these <br>
} things."<br>
