Thanks for these references.  I'll hunt them up.  Wish I'd known about them<br>
earlier.  :(<br>

<p>
Not really.  Communication is usually dialogical, as in this list (as in<br>
this reply).  Even novelists and poets who write in their silent rooms and<br>
fling out messages in bottles get responses back, however mediated, and<br>
those responses help shape their further utterance.  The point I was trying<br>
to make is that communication is reciprocal, even when the reciprocity is<br>
masked or suppressed, and this to-and-fro is lost in the standard<br>
Shannon-style models which have an active Sender uttering a statement meant<br>
to be received with maximum fidelity by a passive (if noise-reducing)<br>
Receiver.  Obviously no receiver is truly passive, because meaning is<br>
(re)constructed out of bits and bytes and context - which is why Reilly<br>
says `What the reader does with it is up to the reader, not the writer'.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Individuals make history and</i><br>
<i>&gt;individuals never recur, so why should history recur?</i><br>
<p>
My reference to Toynbee's punctuations by war is a hint, surely?  My book<br>
elaborates a model by historian Jim Penman, not mentioned in the essay,<br>
based on a blend of observation of apparent historical chunkings and a<br>
theory of behavioral pre-adaptation to food availability cycles.  (I hold<br>
no special brief for this theory, however.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Damien: &lt;We are now living through the exhausted stage of an American</i><br>
<i>&gt;century</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Exhausted stage"?  Is this an empirical statement of fact, or might it be</i><br>
<i>&gt;a bit of chafing over Australia being off the radar screen when it comes to</i><br>
<i>&gt;current superpower status?</i><br>
<p>
Ah, the gratuitous ad hominem surfaces.  I don't much like superpowers, as<br>
it happens, so I'm not chafing.  More to the point, the cited passage is<br>
not me speaking as such but me summarizing the Modelskian theory of long<br>
cycles under discussion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Keith Windschuttle, in his essay "The Real Stuff of History" published in</i><br>
"The<br>
<i>&gt;New Criterion" March 1997.  Windschuttle correctly pointed out that</i><br>
<i>&gt;anthropology and sociology have long lost their intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt;respectability.  He also delivered a devastatingly accurate indictment of</i><br>
<i>&gt;why academia has waged war on the individual.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, Keith read my manuscript and made nice comments about it.  The first<br>
half of the book is precisely about the pathologies of fashionable academic<br>
silliness.  It might be that my own diffidently presented discursive model<br>
is just as silly.  But I don't think it's *obviously* so.<br>
<p>
Thanks to Reilly for a detailed and thought-provoking response.  Writers<br>
*live* for this kind of reaction...<br>
