I asked Vinge about this a few years ago, and he confirmed that it had been<br>
his intention that the zones were artificial, created by something that is<br>
to the Powers as the Powers are to us.  He added that there is nothing in<br>
the book that depends on this assumption-- it was just one of those<br>
background things writers come up with that don't make it into the book.<br>
