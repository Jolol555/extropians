as I already said, here's a nice mid-term investment.<br>

LONDON, April 15 (Reuter) - Precious metals refiner Johnson Matthey<br>
Plc said prospects for higher platinum demand were raised by plans in<br>
the automotive sector to develop fuel cell engines.<br>
<p>
"For automobile fuel cell engines the requirement (for catalysts) will<br>
be approximately 10 grams of platinum per vehicle. This is three to<br>
four times as much platinum as in the catalytic converter fitted to an<br>
internal combustion engine," the company said in a statement.<br>
<p>
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG on Monday announced plans with Ballard Power<br>
Systems Inc. of Canada to bring a new electric car to market in eight<br>
years. The two companies signed a $333 million deal to invest in<br>
developing so-called "fuel-cell" technology.<br>
<p>
Fuel-cell engines, which are already powering prototype buses and<br>
cars, produce no emissions and are said to achieve 30 percent greater<br>
efficiency over gas cells. The "cells" are devices that convert fuels<br>
such as methanols or hydrogen into electricity without combustion.<br>
<p>
Daimler is targetting initial output of fuel cell car engines at<br>
100,000 units. As well as developing its own model, it will also try<br>
to market the technology to other car companies around the world.<br>
<p>
"The objective is really to concentrate on the mass production," said<br>
Ferdinand Panik, head of the project for Daimler.<br>
<p>
Johnson Matthew, which also manufactures platinum catalysts for fuel<br>
cells, said the new investment potentially advanced the date for<br>
commercialisation of fuel cell powered cars by five years.<br>
<p>
"The announcement significantly improves the prospects for fuel cells<br>
as a major new application for platinum in the next decade," said<br>
Jeremy Coombes, general manager marketing at JM's precious metals<br>
division.<br>
<p>
But automotive industry experts said it may take longer to build<br>
consumer demand for the new vehicles.  22:34 04-15-97<br>
