Would this be the MysteryWare hinted at some months ago by Max and Greg?<br>
This is what happens when secret projects get worked on slowly in<br>
private; people start having other ideas.<br>

Insofar as 'exi-paid' would be a separate list, I think Kathryn's<br>
objections are beside the immediate point; we can try the idea and see<br>
what happens.  I agree with her that user-side filtering doesn't seem to<br>
be used as much as it could be.<br>

My own filtering is currently serving all of 6 people, but I realized<br>
later that the service would probably be most useful to people who've<br>
already unsubscribed from the list, a population I can't reach easily,<br>
although I do have a few.  So tell your missing friends.<br>

4-5 of the people receiving my list are ones who would be auto-selected<br>
by my filter.  I'm not sure what that says.<br>
