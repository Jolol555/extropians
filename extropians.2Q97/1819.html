Interesting point. It calls to mind what my mother used to tell me as<br>
a child. "Dont do that," she would say, "or you become no better than<br>
them." (Where 'that' was getting in a fight, tattling, etc.)<br>
<p>
It also reminds me of Rearden's defense in "Atlas Shrugged." That by<br>
refusing to be part of the system, you refuse to be ruled by it, and<br>
deny its right to control you. A defense which hasnt served American<br>
militia and separatist groups well.<br>
<p>
The real point here is that you, as an Extropian, have two choices.<br>
You can be a Hank Rearden, living life your way, but still being<br>
affected by governmental pressures. (Taxes, local ordinances, etc.)<br>
There are things which are difficult to shrug off. (Although, that<br>
does lead us back into the Perpetual Traveler discussion of two weeks<br>
ago.)<br>
<p>
Or, you can use the system as a tool. As an American, I dont have alot<br>
of say in my government. All I can do is use the structure as it is.<br>
And if I see the structure of government as a tool to be used for<br>
change, a very extropian view IMO, I will learn to play the game of<br>
politics. I may not always win, but in my book, it beats doing nothing.<br>
<p>
The two extropian stances on Politics, as I see it, are Becoming a<br>
Perpetual Traveler and dropping out entirely (and legally), or playing<br>
the political game to it's fullest, using it as one uses a hammer or a<br>
crowbar.<br>

P.S.- My recent posts on political issues have a decidedly American<br>
slant because that is all I know. The true GEP (Grand Extropian party)<br>
would be multinational. I realize that politics in, say, Russia are<br>
vastly different than here. But I know that I will be looking for a<br>
political party in 2004 when, finally at age 35, I run for the<br>
Senatorial seat in Ohio. Perhaps I'll be part of the Max More/Robin<br>
Hanson Presidential bandwagon of the Extro Party.<br>
