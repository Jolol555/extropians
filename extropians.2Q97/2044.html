It still came across as HTML.<br>
<p>
<p>
He's not the only one.  Contrary to popular opinion, there are still a<br>
significant number of people who access their mail and news from Unix<br>
terminals, shell accounts, and other related character-based modes.  I<br>
travel frequently; I prefer to Telnet into a server and read my mail<br>
remotely than to download it to someone elses machine, or via someone<br>
else's account.  I would also like to add that HTML is (as you noted) a<br>
*browser* standard, which has little or nothing to do with email.  Email<br>
has been around for a very long time and implements universally recognized<br>
standards that predate the Web by many years.  HTML is merely eye candy,<br>
adding little or no value to text-based forum of size limited messages.  It<br>
might also be noted that mail "enhancement" standards already exist<br>
(although I don't think the Microsoft cartel supports them).<br>
<p>
BEGIN RANT<br>
<p>
The e-mail/news experience would be far better if people spent less time<br>
choosing fonts and more time contemplating the content of their messages.<br>
The sad level of discourse on most Internet newsgroups is a window into the<br>
soul of human race.  Things I have learned on Usenet:  People prefer<br>
fantasy to reality.  Most people have immutable and narrow world views.<br>
There is no bliss greater than ignorance. Fact is a purely subjective term.<br>
 Fundamental rules of evidence and logic are arbitrary and can be redefined<br>
at will.  Ad nauseum...<br>
<p>
Of the 10s of millions of people on the Internet, I would be willing to<br>
state that less than 10,000 add value of any type (e.g. "This webpage is<br>
about my dog, Spot" or "you (suck|are stupid|are unqualified) because you<br>
are critically analyzing my scientifically impossible and logically absurd<br>
hypothesis").  I had a friend a long time ago who once stated that "9 out<br>
of 10 people are functional idiots" and liked to refer to people as "chimps<br>
in pants".  I would like to disagree, but there is an apparent validity to<br>
his comments.  There is a non-trivial segment of the population which<br>
appears to have unsalvageable minds.  <br>
<p>
I don't normally mix or interact with "normal" minded people.  By nature I<br>
tend to associate with people, who if not very similar in mind, are at<br>
least intelligent and open-minded.  Many years back, I joined the Army and<br>
was promptly stuck in South Carolina for many months.  The "up close and<br>
personal" exposure to the type of people I met and worked with in South<br>
Carolina was a major culture shock for me.  A lot of the people I met there<br>
were not only aware of their ignorance and profoundly irrational world<br>
views, they *enjoyed* it.  Their beliefs in modern social and cultural<br>
myths could not be swayed by the most irrefutable evidence.  And some of<br>
the myths were incredible, both in their magnitude and absurdity.  Where<br>
does one start?    <br>
<p>
The one thing I like most about the extropian list is the amount of<br>
rational thought that goes into the content.  I appreciate the fact that<br>
most of the people on this list are clear-thinking, open-minded<br>
individuals.  Even if I disagree with someone's opinion, I enjoy the<br>
exposure to a well thought out paragraph that supports the opposing opinion<br>
in a constructive manner.  I have even changed one or two closely held<br>
viewpoints based on posts made to this list.  In my experience this is<br>
outside the capabilities of the majority of people.<br>
<p>
As much as I would like to "help" everyone else, I am increasingly coming<br>
to the conclusion that most individuals have devised their own demise, and<br>
should suffer by it.  In the long run, everyone is responsible for their<br>
own destiny.  <br>
<p>
<p>
Is it possible that at the current pace of technology and human<br>
development, the gene pool is simply incapable of purging itself in a<br>
timely manner?  Or maybe it is the meme pool?  The only pervasive new memes<br>
seem to be somewhat non-significant and superficial in comparison to the<br>
core "bad" memes we are so concerned about.<br>
