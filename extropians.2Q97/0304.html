AFAIR around 1% of those who apply for astronaut posts are selected. A<br>
large fraction of those who are bounced are bounced on medical grounds, so<br>
if you can pass the medical your odds are probably closer to one in<br>
thirty, and even better if you've also followed the advice in the Usenet<br>
'how to become an astronaut' FAQ (e.g. get a pilot's license, practice<br>
public speaking, work for NASA or a contractor, have a squeaky clean<br>
lifestyle). You can also reapply every couple of years; most of the<br>
astronauts I've met were selected on their second or third try. <br>
<p>
Actually the FAQ brings up an interesting point; the best way to get one<br>
of these glamorous and unusual jobs would seem to involve finding out what<br>
your potential employers are looking for and ensuring that you meet their<br>
requirements. I think a lot of people who wouldn't, say, expect to be<br>
hired as a programmer without no demonstrable programming ability think<br>
that they can be hired as an astronaut without demonstrable astronaut<br>
ability (not in the sense of having flown in space but, say, being able to<br>
give pep talks to halls full of science students).<br>
