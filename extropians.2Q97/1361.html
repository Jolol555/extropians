     my inner geek wrote:<br>
     <br>
     "It's interesting how many companies in the medical device industries <br>
     a quite content selling their products at a very high price, since <br>
     the insurance carriers pick up the bills.<br>
     <br>
     "Consumer PC technologies are driven prices down, but many of these <br>
     companies are reluctant to incorporate these less expensive <br>
     technologies into their products because it would decrease their <br>
     profits.<br>
     <br>
     "One possible GENERAL strategy would be to examine the whole industry <br>
     of medical electronics.  Then, instrument by instrument, create <br>
     competing designs based on the latest microprocessors, PCs, &amp; DSPs.<br>
     <br>
     I imagine that many developing nations would appreciate having <br>
     alternatives when shopping for the hardware for new hospitals."<br>
     <br>
     Bravo Ken!  This is the type of neuron firing I would like to see more <br>
     of in this forum.  For me, you informed me of an exciting new <br>
     technology which I was hoping someone would invent (personally I'm <br>
     looking forward to downloadable music and video as an alternative to <br>
     videos/CDs).  You also pointed out a sedentary characteristic of the <br>
     medical establishment and its dysfunctional connection with insurance <br>
     which likely causes health care to be less affordable and accessible <br>
     to all citizens.  You then underscored the benefit of a retooling (a <br>
     favorite Extropian pursuit I dare say) this industry for not only our <br>
     own culture's benefit but for the developing nations who may yet <br>
     benefit from us blazing the industrial trail and possibly saving them <br>
     a few steps/pitfalls.  <br>
     <br>
     This was my expectation of Extropian thinking, here evidenced in Ken's <br>
     e-mail.  It contributes, it is inquiring and innovative, it is not <br>
     self-serving, and expresses benevolent vision.  What else would be the <br>
     agenda of the wizened visionary?<br>
     <br>
     Thanks for the URL reference to the Firewire home page.  Exciting <br>
     stuff!  As we approach critical mass connectivity, think of what may <br>
     be accomplished.  Our world is becoming a fully developed brain and <br>
     each of us are its synapses.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
