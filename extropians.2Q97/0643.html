<i>&gt; I'm not satisfied with how well the Extropy Institute web site shows up on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the search engines, especially now that we're about to get the word out</i><br>
<i>&gt; about EXTRO 3.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I welcome suggestions for registration services. I have information from</i><br>
<i>&gt; Central Registry which looks good, though it costs $249. For that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; register you with 550 indexes and directories. They claim to be the oldest</i><br>
<i>&gt; registry and the most comprehensive. Does anyone know if they are good? Are</i><br>
<i>&gt; there others services practically as good but less expensive?</i><br>
<p>
Quanitity of listing is useless.  What counts is consumer attention,<br>
which is dominated by the top dozen or so indexes (Yahoo, AltaVista,<br>
Excite, ...), which are all free.  Who care's if some podunk index<br>
lists you or not if nobody looks there?<br>
<p>
Seems to me, the best strategy is a little simple elbow grease.  Sit<br>
down at each of the big indexes, look for subjects related to you,<br>
and send mail to whatever lists you find.  If you can't find them on<br>
the first pass, they don't matter; and if those 500 lists aren't the<br>
ones found on a related-subject search, they don't matter either.<br>
<p>
Also--and this is an important underappreciated matter--keep your<br>
HTML clean and searchable.  Make sure your headers are actually<br>
in header tags, that you include appropriate keyword METAs, that all<br>
text is entered as actual text and not just graphics, that all the<br>
graphics have ALT tags, that you don't play tricks like capitalizing<br>
words like "&lt;font size=+1&gt;E&lt;font size=-1&gt;xtropy", etc.  Things like<br>
that make it harder for search engines to find keywords and index you<br>
appropriately.  In other words, write to the medium: HTML is a language<br>
of content and structure, not appearance and style.  You need style as<br>
well, of course, and that's what style sheets are for.  Unfortunately<br>
the big two browsers don't yet correctly support style sheets (IE 3.0<br>
supports most of it, Netscape not at all), so you'll have to do some<br>
embedded style work until Netscape gets off their ass and does it<br>
right, but you can still be kind to the robots without sacrificing too<br>
much style.<br>
