The problem with that thesus is that the state does not actually<br>
interfere in economic development. As anyone with a degree or two and<br>
meaningful experience in public administration and public policy can<br>
tell you (if they're honest), economic policy is usually developed by<br>
the special interest groups and lobbys that have the financial ability<br>
and desire to get those members of congress elected who they can then<br>
influence via funds (see bribes?)for their re-election. As a quid pro<br>
quo the special interests get what they pay for. <br>
<p>
To a great extent democracy is an illusion under our present campaign<br>
financing system.<br>
The disillusionment of many members of the public toward indirect<br>
representation as it has evolved is possibly one of the reasons for the<br>
advance of the libertarian as well as the right wing "conservative"<br>
movement. Both seem to want to reject the status quo. Their approaches<br>
to the problems in our evolving system seem quite different but I<br>
believe that they are more similar than they would like to acknowledge.<br>
<p>
Ultimately, as our minds, cultures, societies and other other tangable<br>
and intangable systems continue to evolve, I suspect that we will<br>
eventually develop the wherewithall to engage in some form of<br>
participatory democracy based on our individual and combined knowledge,<br>
skills and abilities. In such a scheme the criteria for public<br>
representation will (hopefully) be competency based. <br>
