In a message dated 97-05-05 16:09:26 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Remove government and you get a dictatorship of banks / monopolies. Much<br>
 worse than gov't could ever be. Freedom? You'll be so free, you'll want<br>
 to buy a whole load of guns in order to defend yourself from street<br>
 thugs. Equality? Raising life standard? Nope. But nobody who defends<br>
 markets claims that -- that's natural selection. Eat or be eaten. Live<br>
 and let die. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
Oh, come now, Erik.  Think about it.  If you remove government, you also<br>
remove all the rules and regulations, not to mention subsidies, which are<br>
allowing these monopolies, banks, and such to exist in the first place.  If<br>
government were completely eliminated, so would be the source(s) of power<br>
which monopolies and banks now hold.  Almost immediately, alternative sources<br>
of everything would pop up all over by free marketers who would like to earn<br>
a profit.  New banks, not held to stupid "Federal Reserve" standards would<br>
open.  MONOPOLIES CAN NOT EXIST IN AN ANARCHO-CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY!<br>
<p>
As for your comment on what you think would be an apparent rise in crime,<br>
that's also rediculous, but the part about us all buying guns is true.  We<br>
should all have them anyway, to protect ourselves from others who may use<br>
force against us, to rob us or harm us.  But these "rebels" would soon<br>
discover that using force against people in an anarcho-capitalistic society<br>
is about the fastest way to "check out" of this life.  Anyone I catch robbing<br>
me or trying to harm me, once we have an anarcho-capitalistic society, will<br>
find themselves dead quite quickly.  Force may be used only when someone else<br>
is using force against you or your property.  That's my opinon.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,  Shawn Johnson<br>
