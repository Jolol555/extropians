<p>
 SOME IMPORTANT THEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED IF WE THINK OF GOD AS A<br>
COMPUTER PROGRAMMER.<br>
<p>
Q: Does God control everything that happens in my life?<br>
A: He could, if he used the debugger, but it's tedious to step through all<br>
those variables.<br>
<p>
Q: Why does God allow evil to happen?<br>
A: God thought he eliminated evil in one of the earlier revs.<br>
<p>
Q: Does God know everything?<br>
A: He likes to think so, but he is often amazed to find out what goes on in<br>
the overnight job.<br>
<p>
Q: What causes God to intervene in earthly affairs?<br>
A: If a critical error occurs, the system pages him automatically and he<br>
logs on from home to try to bring it up. Otherwise things can wait until<br>
tomorrow.<br>
<p>
Q: Did God really create the world in seven days?<br>
A: He did it in six days and nights while living on cola and candy bars.<br>
On the seventh day he went home and found out his girlfriend had left him.<br>
<p>
Q: How come the Age of Miracles Ended?<br>
A: That was the development phase of the project, now we are in the<br>
maintenance phase.<br>
<p>
Q: Will there be another Universe after the Big Bang?<br>
A: A lot of people are drawing things on the white board, but<br>
doubt that it will ever be implemented.<br>
<p>
Q: Who is Satan?<br>
A: Satan is an MIS director who takes credit for more powers than he<br>
actually possesses, so people who aren't programmers are scared of him. God<br>
thinks<br>
of him as irritating but irrelevant.<br>
<p>
Q: What is the role of sinners?<br>
A: Sinners are the people who find new and imaginative ways to mess up the<br>
system when God has made it idiot-proof.<br>
<p>
Q: Where will I go after I die?<br>
A: Onto a backup tape.<br>
<p>
Q: Will I be reincarnated?<br>
A: Not unless there is a special need to recreate you. And searching<br>
backup files is a major hassle, so if there is a request for you, God will<br>
just<br>
say that the tape has been lost.<br>
<p>
Q: Am I unique and special in the universe?<br>
A: There are over 10,000 major university and corporate sites running<br>
exact duplicates of you in the present release version.<br>
<p>
Q: What is the purpose of the universe?<br>
A: God created it because he values elegance and simplicity, but then the<br>
users and managers demanded he tack senseless features onto it and now<br>
everything is more complicated and expensive than ever.<br>
<p>
Q: If I pray to God, will he listen?<br>
A: You can waste his time telling him what to do, or you can just get off<br>
his back and let him program.<br>
<p>
Q: What is the one true religion?<br>
A: All systems have their advantages and disadvantages, so just pick the<br>
one that best suits your needs and don't let anyone put you down.<br>
<p>
Q: How can I protect myself from evil?<br>
A: Change your password every month and don't make it a name, a common<br>
word, or a date like your birthday.<br>
<p>
Q: Some people claim they hear the voice of God. Is this true?<br>
A: They are much more likely to receive e-mail.<br>
<p>
Q: Some people say God is Love.<br>
A: That is not a question. Please restate your query in the form of a<br>
question. Abort, Retry, Fail?<br>
