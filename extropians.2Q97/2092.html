Once in a while there appears a new technology that promises<br>
dramatic social changes. It often comes unexpectedly, from some<br>
modest-looking area of science and engineering, and I always<br>
wonder what is going to appear next.<br>
<p>
  One candidate for such new technology may be aerial robotics.<br>
People have been working on mobile robots for a while now.<br>
The most difficult issue with walking robots seems to be<br>
orientation in the environment.<br>
Image recognition is a very costly and difficult task, and it<br>
is essential for moving around on land. Not that much in other<br>
environments though - like air or water.  There are additional<br>
difficulties of aerial robotics: the craft must have efficient<br>
and light-weight equipment for position identification and<br>
communication - but these problems are now resolved with<br>
cellular modems and GPS.<br>
  So now you can build little blimps, planes and helicopters<br>
that can fly around and do things.  Aerial robots may free people<br>
from many tasks that are "dull, dirty, or dangerous" (D3) - or<br>
costly: a pigeon-sized flying robot may quickly accomplish missions<br>
- like deliver your pills from the farmacy, or take a picture of<br>
a corn field from the air - that now require a car or a helicopter.<br>
<p>
 You don't have to own an aerial robot.  They may be available for<br>
hire at a very low price (a few dollars an hour or less), and you could<br>
rent one for a 5-minute mission for a quarter.  The robots could also<br>
refuel themselves at automated gas stations, paying with digital cash<br>
there - so they will require minimal maintenance from an owner.<br>
<p>
Now, let me list some interesting things that aerial robots could do:<br>
<p>
- collect information: a flying robot can visit places, or follow objects,<br>
and record and/or transmit everything it can observe.  That allows you<br>
to fly a little craft with a camera around the Great Canyon, or above the<br>
Eiffel tower (you can control it via Internet, and get images and<br>
sounds back), "virtually visiting" a real museum by flying a WebCam-<br>
equipped blimp through its halls, following wild animals and cute<br>
girls, spying after [potential?] criminals or anybody else, etc.<br>
<p>
[  An interesting issue here is that it may be very difficult to identify<br>
   who the robot is serving at any particular moment.  So physical tasks<br>
   can be as anonymous as Internet communications. ]<br>
<p>
- deliver small physical objects. Getting pills or apples is one example.<br>
  There are more fun things to do though.  You can drop a dead frog<br>
  on your neighbor's head.  Or spray some foul substance over a crowd.<br>
  Or deliver drugs - quickly and anonymously.  Or shoot somebody from<br>
  the air.  You can also steal small things by driving robots remotely,<br>
  or teaching them to pick up rings, dollar bills, etc.<br>
<p>
 It seems that the features of small aerial robots - being aiborne,<br>
cheap and anonymous - allow to do lots of things from which the society<br>
doesn't have much protection.  Introduction of aerial robots that is<br>
likely to happen on a large scale within the next 5 to 10 years, may<br>
deliver multiple benefits, and at the same time create quite a turmoil.<br>
- And wait until we have lots of swimming and running little robots.<br>
<p>
