 <br>
Um... no.  I've just read _Consider Phlebas_ ("a minor spoiler consists<br>
of knowing that it _is_ a 'Culture book'") and that's not how I'd<br>
describe the conflict.  Unless you consider the Idiran religious drive to<br>
expansion and domination of weaker races, including nuking their cities,<br>
a "hold-out-for-individualism" culture.  The protagonist is a mercenary<br>
of principle who doesn't so much agree with the Idirans as he opposes<br>
the Culture as a machine-worshipping cancer in the galaxy.  The Culture<br>
seems to be rather high on ability to realize individual potential,<br>
frankly; that's the whole point of the utopia.  The question is the<br>
productive underpinnings.<br>
<p>
True, you might not be able to realize your potential as dictator of<br>
some Third World planet.  This is partly because the members of Contact<br>
will be realizing their individual potential to interfere with you.<br>
<p>
Banks seems to consider money just "an inefficient form of rationing".<br>
As I understand it money can be considered a form of rationing, but one<br>
mathematically proven to be efficient under ideal circumstances.  Not<br>
that Earth has any ideal governments to outcompete the real markets.  In<br>
the Culture production mostly is automated, supervised by people who<br>
want to as a hobby.  I've never seen the distribution system; I'd guess<br>
you ask for something, and a robot is sent by the Hub or ship Mind to<br>
deliver it.  Rationing doesn't seem to be necessary for any "reasonable"<br>
need; anyone can have what they want.<br>
<p>
No one seems to ask for a mole of widgets.  Possibly because everyone in<br>
the Culture is supposed to be sane.  I'm not sure what happens if you<br>
demand a mole of widgets.  Presumably the local Mind says "no."  But the<br>
Mind would give you a ship (no AI) and factory stuff, so you could go<br>
out and make your widgets out of junk no one claimed.  Unless your<br>
widgets were thrall-AI warships, in which case someone might stop you in<br>
self-defense.  For which I can hardly blame them.<br>
<p>
Thing is, there's no reason there couldn't be money in the Culture.  But<br>
money facilitates trade, and there isn't enough regular trade to support<br>
money.  Stuff gets grabbed and turned into things.  This isn't a<br>
socialist economy; it's a slowly-growing frontier economy.<br>
<p>
Also, if the Culture was run (or admitted being run) by the Minds, it<br>
might be able to claim having an ideal government.  The number of<br>
components of the Mind in _Consider Phlebas_ seems to imply that single<br>
Minds can outthink the population of Earth.  And his numbers are<br>
probably conservative, given the technology he's playing with.<br>
<p>
} Certainly, the key point about the Culture, its tremendous technological<br>
} ability, its power beyond measure, couldn't be *arrived at* by a<br>
} socialist path, since technological *progress* is a function of the kind<br>
} of utility testing that only capitalist cultures allow.  But perhaps<br>
<p>
I don't know what that means.  Just about nothing is actually forbidden<br>
in the Culture, certainly not experimentation.  Competition for<br>
scarce resources gives an incentive for improvement, and competition<br>
allows diversity.  Progress would happen in the Culture via play; no one<br>
has to work for a living, but people want to explore and try new things<br>
to keep boredom away.  And the Minds have an efficiency fetish and<br>
curiosity built in.  Such viewpoints certainly shouldn't seem odd to<br>
anyone on this list.<br>
<p>
} I suppose if we're going to get machines to look after us and drop the *<br>
} necessity* of work, the Culture's as good a vision of that as you could<br>
} hope for.  But Banks is always wrestling with the inherent boringness of<br>
} such a situation.<br>
<p>
Boring to write about, yes.  That's why all his books deal with abnormal<br>
circumstances.  Boring to live in?  Hah.  Only for those who don't know<br>
what to do with their lives, but never have time to worry about it<br>
because they're too caught up in or exhausted by working for their<br>
livelihood.<br>
