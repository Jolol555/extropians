<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Using hydrogen as an energy source for ground transportation, despite<br>
being the pipe dream of Greens everywhere, has not made an entry into<br>
the market because it is technolgically and economically unfeasible<br>
until the price of oil reaches at least $60 per barrel, i.e. not in the<br>
forseeable future. Remember, you need to make that hydrogen at power<br>
plants, and without nuclear plants, we are talking about fossil fuels<br>
(if all of the wind and water power in the world were harnessed with no<br>
consideration for environmental effects, it would add up to less than<br>
15% of current demand; with automobile power demands on the grid, expect<br>
this to be less than 3% of demand). While the concept of producing all<br>
power at power plants where generators run at maximum efficiency<br>
(75-95%) on a constant basis is an optimum one, using hydrogen as a<br>
medium of transporting that power is not. <br>
<p>
WHile hydrogen is light, it is also very bulky, and has a very lower<br>
power density, as bad or worse than current electric batteries. It is<br>
also extremely corrosive, making storeage, pumping, and engine parts<br>
very expensive to build and maintain. Use of this fuel is also not 100%<br>
efficient either, contrary to the prior writers statement. The most<br>
efficient hydrolysis of water attains 98-99% efficiency, while the<br>
motors in cars that would burn the hydrogen have the same levels of<br>
inefficiency as current motors, as that is what they are. An internal<br>
combustion motor is at shaft typically 45% efficient, while the<br>
efficiencies of the power train and surface and atmospheric drag cause<br>
this rate to be degraded to around 18-24% or less, no matter what fuel<br>
is burned. Hydrogen also burns very hot, requiring materials of higher<br>
temperature endurance than normal engines.<br>
<p>
Until fuel cells become compact enough to be really usefull, which I<br>
think will happen in 5-10 years at most, the optimum power system for a<br>
car is a small 15kW gas turbine generator running electric drive motors<br>
and maintaining an electric charge in a battery system 1/10th the size<br>
of that currently used in electric cars, which is only needed for on<br>
demand power needs (acceleration). The turbine runs at constant max<br>
efficiency, like a large power plant, is compact, with a high power<br>
density.<br>
