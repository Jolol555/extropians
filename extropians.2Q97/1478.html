Yes, it is tiring. The problem is that they usually can't construct<br>
rational arguments and don't care to because they never have to. In<br>
the same way they don't understand why a rational argument is better <br>
than an irrational argument (OK, honest introspection time: can you <br>
explain why?). I pity them.<br>
<p>
Usually I try to ask them if their mumbo-jumbo have any bearing on<br>
reality. If they say it has, I then point out that in that case they<br>
can be proved or disproved through rational methods; if they<br>
sincerely believe in their views they should be ready to analyze them<br>
critically, since a true view would be able to withstand critique. I<br>
also point out to relativists that their relativistic views are<br>
contradict themselves: if everyone is right, then I as a<br>
non-relativist is right and there are absolutes. <br>
<p>
But of course, few understand this kind of attack. So often when I<br>
feel irritated I play along and see how bizarre their ideas can get<br>
with some help from me. Since many new age people are utterly<br>
uncritical it is not hard to lead their ideas into the strangest<br>
directions (this works fine on fundamentalists too, as long as you<br>
play along). <br>

Vic Stenger named it "cosmythology", using scientific terms to<br>
"prove" that magick, psi or God exists without understanding<br>
anything. <br>
<p>
We need to teach ourselves and others rational thinking, and we<br>
better start now. <br>
