I think this is overoptimistic. Some things may be possible, but<br>
nearly impossible to find out how to do. <br>

It is likely part of our skills; the neural networks which correspond<br>
to different abilities overlap, and have no sharp edges. Our habits,<br>
personalities and quirks are integrated into them. Hunches might be<br>
the result of subconscious processing "bubbling up to the surface" so<br>
to say. <br>

Very true. This is my vision of paradise. <br>
<p>

You will likely still need to study, in order to make use of the<br>
information. Merely having the sum of human knowledge at your<br>
fingertips won't help you much. You will need skills to search though<br>
it (how would you do to find out what rheology is about?), critical<br>
thinking (is the physics of Jack Sarfatti reasonable?) and the<br>
ability to integrate it to a whole (what does evolutionary theory,<br>
memetics and western history say about the future of postmodernism?).<br>
