Yes, I can't imagine having "enough" money. Bill Gates is now worth over<br>
$30 billion. If I had that much (and even if it were all liquid instead of<br>
mostly tied up in stock) I certainly wouldn't think it was enough. Bill<br>
just gave $200 million (that's not at typo!) to help libraries buy<br>
computers and get more people on the Net. A worthy project, but with that<br>
much money I'd also be funding major amounts of life extension research,<br>
among other things. $30 billions really isn't much at to promote some of my<br>
goals, including getting control of aging in a hurry, bringing about<br>
nanotech, creating good neural-computer interfaces, setting up many good<br>
private schools, influencing third world governments (actually *all*<br>
governments) to move to free markets, researching more efficient space<br>
transportation systems, understanding the brain, etc. <br>
<p>
I've always thought a pretty good test of intelligence was to ask someone<br>
what they would do with $X, and keeping increasing the value of X until<br>
they can't think of anything else to do with it, except buy 50 Rolls<br>
Royce's (as a certain guru did not long ago). I suspect most people on this<br>
list wouldn't have any trouble finding sensible ways to spend their first<br>
trillion dollars.<br>
