&lt;&lt; &gt;To the Victorians, who rarely saw a naked ankle, even the sight of an<br>

<i> &gt;societal norms on body modesty as fewer and fewer people noticed or</i><br>
<i> &gt;eroticized nudity qua nudity.</i><br>

Then Robin's response is:<br>

<i> &gt;prudish and the routinely nude cultures are self-consistent equilibria</i><br>
<i> &gt;in certain contexts.  But most of human history has been between these</i><br>
<i> &gt;extremes, and so absent a reason to expect some fundamentally new</i><br>

I'm the originator of this line, and I'd like to say, one major reason I<br>
think the world will go nude is due to the fact that almost all the current<br>
reasons people wear clothing is due to religious beliefs, or just plain being<br>
accustomed to it.  Once the "average" person has eliminated mysticisms, as<br>
would be expected in a highly advanced society of the future, the very reason<br>
people wear clothes will be gone.  The "averageo" person will also be more<br>
inclined not to do forceful things, like rape, or else they would have been<br>
"taken care of" at some point in time be private athorities.  As for the need<br>
to prevent "overexposure" to the sun, or to the extreme cold, clothing will<br>
still be optional.  I just think that one comes to a mental point of<br>
realizing that at times, there is no need for clothes, and thus, a "rational"<br>
person would choose to save his/her/its resources, not wear something<br>
unneccessarily, and have no hangups about his physical body, which at some<br>
point in time will itself be considered "clothing" to the mind (after<br>
uploading, or at least once we have sufficient data transfer techniques to<br>
change bodies).  Any comments?<br>
