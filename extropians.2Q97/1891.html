This is precisely a point which Abraham Maslow refers to in _Toward A<br>
Psychology Of Being_.  He states, and I'll paraphrase here, that if we<br>
squelch our ideas for fear of seeming foolish or dumb, we could be<br>
inhibiting a very important ingredient of our thinking process.  This<br>
ingredient I'll refer to as "raw creativity."  It stems from the unconscious<br>
mind and can be pretty creepy.  It can be alarming, it can be scary.  Yet,<br>
if we inhibit ourselves, we just might be inhibiting an idea, once<br>
developed, could help us in the future obtain far-reached inventions.<br>
<p>
And, this is where wisdom of experience comes in. Smart people do say what's<br>
on their mind because the developed sense of self-trust that the thinking<br>
processes has become finely tuned.  And, even if a slur of speech is<br>
extracted that raises an eye-brow or two, so what!  Many geniuses have<br>
laughed at themselves for a foolish though.  And, in doing so have gained<br>
the respect from their associates.<br>
<p>
You are correct in accessing that people who don't care what others think<br>
are less troubled by reverberations. Yet, I tend to think that individuals<br>
who don't care what other people think are defensive, and have a lot of<br>
maturing to do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In areas where ideas are likely to be accepted, I tend to look to</i><br>

<i>&gt;creative ideas are likely to get people into trouble, I look more</i><br>

<i>&gt;clueless.</i><br>
<p>
I look for established voices also.  I also look for less known voices that<br>
have wisdom. The "fringe" is not really a fringe by the people who are<br>
sitting on the edge of the cliff.  It's quite cosy there and plenty of room<br>
to mingle about.  It looks like the fringe 'cause it might be unfamiliar,<br>
but its really quite ordinary.<br>
