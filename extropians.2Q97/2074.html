<p>
Have you posted your reasons for believing this and I've just<br>
missed them? If not, I'd be interested to hear your reasons.<br>
Several people of my acquaintance have devoted a large portion<br>
of their working time over the last few years to creating<br>
software that people can use to protect their privacy, and<br>
distributing it in a way that will make it difficult for<br>
law-enforcement types to stamp out. Try a web search on<br>
"cypherpunks" for further information.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; The technologies that we are pushing on this list are just as easily</i><br>
<i> &gt; used against us as they are by us and for us. Since these technologies</i><br>
<i> &gt; *will* someday exist, I feel also that the last remnants of what we call</i><br>
<i> &gt; privacy will dissipate into a vestigial anachronism. I have resigned</i><br>
<i> &gt; myself to this, and that attitude has infiltrated my post. </i><br>
<p>
Defense has the advantage over offense in cryptography issues.<br>
In the Information Era, most privacy issues reduce to<br>
cryptography issues. The attempts by legislators to force people<br>
to use weak cryptography will never be effective against those<br>
who have the time and inclination to educate themselves about<br>
the technologies involved. Cultural transformation could easily<br>
lead to a society in which arrest and imprisonment of those who<br>
use secure privacy software is socially accepted, but that's<br>
hardly inevitable, at least in North America. And even if that<br>
comes about, most hacker scofflaws go unpunished, and the more<br>
hacker scofflaws get thrown in solitary confinement for eight<br>
months (Kevin Mitnick is currently being abused this way, for<br>
instance), the more hacker scofflaws will be motivated to work<br>
on nasty little tricks, and to evade apprehension. <br>
<p>
<i> &gt; Words are being put into my mouth as far as I can figure.</i><br>
<p>
This is a problem that often afflicts those who draw their<br>
handles from works of literature that are famous among the<br>
audiences they are addressing. I myself put no words in your<br>
mouth: I simply quoted the words of the person whose name you<br>
are wearing.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt; I am really unsure of what you are assuming about me. If thought Big</i><br>
<i> &gt; Brother was inevitable, would this also mean I wanted it to happen? </i><br>
<p>
No, but I haven't seen you present any reasons why you really<br>
think Big Brother is inevitable, and I really would like to hear<br>
more about what they are.<br>
