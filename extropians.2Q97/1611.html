<i>&gt; I would like to know your opinion about why are we allowed to age? Why,</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Following the darwinist concept of evolution, surely a trait that would</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow one individual to live longer than the others would be favoured.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Indiduals with these trait would produce more offspring and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; the trait would soon be present in the general population. This,</i><br>
<i>&gt; however, doesn't happen with humans neither (as far as I know) other</i><br>
<i>&gt; mammals. If, there are species capable of such intellectual skills (such</i><br>
<i>&gt; as us) and many other species with amazing skills, why hasn't a</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-aging process evolved in many more species that it did?</i><br>
<p>
If it weren't for modern medicine, evolution would be a bit more<br>
effective. Since we no longer let the "bad genes" die off, they don't go<br>
away.<br>
<p>
Just a guess,<br>
