Hello Extropians,<br>
<p>
I listened to a NPR radio show today about a survey of scientists as to<br>
whether they believe in the existence of a God.   60% don't have any<br>
belief in a God and 40% have varying degrees of belief including one who<br>
called Jesus Christ the most knowledgeable scientist to walk the earth.<br>
<p>
The monitor quoted Albert Einstein as referring to a God, indicating<br>
that he had a belief in God but detested the Judeo-Christian God.  I<br>
hear the quote that Einstein said that God did not throw dice in the<br>
creation of the universe.<br>
<p>
Heisenberg was referred to as having a belief in a unifying principle.<br>
<p>
Could someone comment on the above and give the scientific viewpoint on<br>
God, a metaphysical soul etc.<br>
<p>
I found the comments of Anders Sandberg in reference to NDE to be very<br>
informative.  I have a co-worker who had an alleged NDE experience 20<br>
years ago which changed her life.  It seems to have the reprogramming<br>
aspects that Anders referred to.<br>
