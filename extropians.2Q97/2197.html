<i>&gt; I would love to hear the history of how various people on the list came</i><br>
<i>&gt; to hold some of their extropic ideas.  </i><br>
<p>
	I stumbled across an Extropian website while looking for information on<br>
getting a clock to run from a potato (never did find it...).  I was trying<br>
to at least develop some ideas on how a watch could be installed in<br>
someone's arm but a better idea for that has already been discussed on the<br>
list.<br>
	I've been interested in science fiction for a while, cyborgs especially. <br>
Libertarian ideas never really interested me much (I did have dreams of<br>
conquering the world...) until I checked out David Friedman's website.  I<br>
then read Machinery of Freedom and I was hooked.  Now I dream of conquering<br>
solar systems, but of ruling nobody.<br>
