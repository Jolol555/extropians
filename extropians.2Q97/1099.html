A good rebuttal against creationists is something like : " Creation is the<br>
ultimate bad theory because it can neither be reproduced nor disproven."*<br>
It doesn't apply quite so well to spiritualism, though, but if you think<br>
along these lines I'm sure you can come up with something. Good luck.<br>

*(This is contingent on the event that they actually understand what you<br>
are saying, of course)<br>

<i>&gt;Last night I found myself in a futile conversation.  I couldn't tell at</i><br>
<i>&gt;first if this woman was on a mystic-trip or actually in touch with</i><br>
<i>&gt;reality, but I new it was over when she said, "Have you read _The</i><br>
<i>&gt;Celestine Prophesy_?"  I'm sure many of you have been there...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The woman I conversed with exhibited a pattern of thought that I've noticed in</i><br>
<i>&gt;numerous conversations with New Agers:  They can rebuke any attempt at</i><br>
<i>&gt;rational thought b/c their belief system allows them to say anything,</i><br>
<i>&gt;making up mind-fodder as they go along.  Now, many of you who are far more</i><br>
<i>&gt;leathal at intellectual sparring than I are surely more successful at arguing</i><br>
<i>&gt;with mystics than I.  My arguing skills are need of developement (hence</i><br>
<i>&gt;this post).  As I struggle to put together rational replies to their</i><br>
<i>&gt;fanciful ramblings, these mystics run circles around my logic.  How do</i><br>
<i>&gt;experienced rational thinkers deal with people who can say anything (that</i><br>
<i>&gt;is to the extent that they can be dealt with)?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also, these people think they are quantum mechanics, rigging their</i><br>
<i>&gt;silliness with quatum "stuff."  These people don't even have a clue about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;concept of a quantized energy packet, yet they think that watching _Quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt;Leap_ or reading books by quacks who give no references gives them</i><br>
<i>&gt;understanding enough to invoke quantum physics as "proof" of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;madness.  I know just enough about quantum mechanics to know not to f***</i><br>
<i>&gt;with it, yet they don't notice that the people who do know what they're</i><br>
<i>&gt;talking about spend years, if not decades, understanding quantum mechanics</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the extent that is understood.  These fruit-loops are a sad lot.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Enough angst.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Exovivo!</i><br>
