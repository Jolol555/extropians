<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Media propaganda.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; WHose? The Cuban Government jams all US radio and television boradcasts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; to the point of occasionally interfering in the southern Florida</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; broadcast market area. Cubans get a banana version of the BBC: 3</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; channels of government propaganda.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I do not only see TV and radio as media, but also people. Trained</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; demagogues who are supposed to infiltrate Cuba.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Well, you know, trained demagogues are out in force all over the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; defending Cuba -- take you, for example. And yet, we don't see people</i><br>
<i>&gt; fleeing the west for the socialist paradise.</i><br>
<p>
Sure. I get money from these evil communists dwelling everywhere for<br>
correcting gross mistakes made by Libertarians like you. The communist<br>
world conspiracy is coming your way. Time to defend your property.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Such operations have always taken place, not only in Cuba, but in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other countries, too. When you see big demonstrations in the Tv,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; like in Bosnia, Bulgaria etc., this can only be the effect of media</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; propaganda.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; You know, its amazing how close that assessment is to the one that</i><br>
<i>&gt; Richard Nixon gave for anti-Vietnam war protests. "Outside</i><br>
<i>&gt; Agitators". No one on their own could *possibly* dislike someone like</i><br>
<i>&gt; Slobodan Milosovich -- after all, he's the friend of the workers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; right?</i><br>
<p>
Yes. The war in Bosnia was a product of western capitalist countries,<br>
designed to change power structures in that region and to push arms<br>
industry.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I bet the wall fell in East Germany because of those darn trained</i><br>
<i>&gt; "outside agitators" too, just like with the student protests in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; '60s in the U.S.</i><br>
<p>
The wall in Germany fell because of massive media propaganda. Kohl<br>
himself admitted this afterwards and said it would not have been<br>
possible without western media. Of course hundreds of thousands of<br>
unemployed people in East Germany would prefer socialism now.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This little Cuba is, besides North Korea, one of the last socialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; regimes which doesn't privatize itself too much. The effects on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; people living there are bad, and maybe free markets would make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; standard of living better for many of them (making Cuba what it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; under Batista, the brothel and casino of the US)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yeah. Right now, its so much better with it being the brothel and</i><br>
<i>&gt; casino of the European countries that send tourists.</i><br>
<p>
That's simply not the case. Many tourists are disappointed after their<br>
travel to Cuba because there was no single prostitute. Even in Havana<br>
you will find hardly more prostitutes than in Berlin or Cologne.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; -- but if Cuba was a free market country and isolated the way it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; now, you can be sure that it would be much worse there than in North</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Korea.</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Dunno. South Africa managed to do pretty well even when it was under</i><br>
<i>&gt; sanctions. Of course, Cuba isn't *really* isolated -- the government</i><br>
<i>&gt; is free to buy anything it likes from Canada, Europe, and South</i><br>
<i>&gt; America. Sanctions there are astoundingly porous -- Americans can even</i><br>
<i>&gt; go there pretty freely if you travel through Mexico or Canada.</i><br>
<p>
A good economy is not only characterized by its growth or size, but also<br>
by the distribution of wealth and the inequality. That's what<br>
Libertarians always forget. And that's why people like you might mean<br>
the end of this planet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; When you claim that they spread propaganda, you must prove it. It has</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; been proven for US media millions of times (see media during Vietnam &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Gulf War, presidential elections etc.)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Walter Cronkite's painful declaration on the evening news that the war</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Vietnam wasn't a good thing must be a collective hallucination of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the proletariat, eh?</i><br>
<p>
I can't remember any politician who said that war is a good thing. Most<br>
of them just said it was necessary. Words are just words, and deeds are<br>
deeds. The US aggression against Vietnam and other communist countries<br>
was simply wrong (although a war can never be justified).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And the media in the US aren't owned by gov't. Why do they support</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe they have this weird idea that its better to be in a free</i><br>
<i>&gt; country where they can print what they like?</i><br>
<p>
&lt;very big evil grin&gt;<br>
<p>
Maybe you should ask the guys at a-albionic research how free western<br>
media are.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I am no communist. I wouldn't want to live in Cuba, North Korea or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; China. I already said that my "dream-economy" is that of Japan,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; partially because of state intervention, partially because of a kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "politics of consent".</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see you know at least as much about Japan as you do about most other</i><br>
<i>&gt; things.</i><br>
<p>
You bore me. Your mental abilities seem to be limited to insults and<br>
rant.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Big enterprise leaders there have realized that operating the way US</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; leaders do would lead their country back to the Middle Age.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Strange that the U.S. isn't back in the middle ages. I guess we just</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a shortage of cathedrals and hand illuminated manuscripts</i><br>
<i>&gt; standing between us and economic chaos.</i><br>
<p>
With 15 % poor people, low education standard, a rich power elite,<br>
propaganda by TV religions and enterprise advertising, growing<br>
inequality and a hardly existant welfare system, the US are one of the<br>
saddest examples for free markets ins world history and will remind<br>
anyone with a little bit of brain capacity of the Middle <br>
Ages.<br>
