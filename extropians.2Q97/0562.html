<i>&gt;You are speaking from theory.  In reality, I don't think anyone has yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;shown that a society without compulsion can compete with other societies</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the real world.</i><br>
<p>
Looked at scientifically, what Phil is saying is, we don't have any data<br>
points for *exactly zero* compulsion.<br>
<p>
However, we do have lots of data about *different levels* of compulsion,<br>
and guess how it correllates with quality of life?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am aware that there are some good ideas floating</i><br>
<i>&gt;around about [defense, education, money supply].  But</i><br>
<i>&gt;until they have been proven to work, it's silly to get indignant about it.</i><br>
<p>
Let's separate some issues:<br>
1) Would anarchy be better if we could make it work?<br>
2) How can we get rid of the hard-to-get-rid-of kinds of compulsion?<br>
3) Is it silly to get indignant in the mean time?<br>
4) What are people getting indignant about in this particular letter case?<br>
<p>
1) If you prefer data to theory, freedom seems to correllate with quality<br>
   of life in vast amounts of practical experience across the world and<br>
   through history.<br>
2) As Phil says, freedom has to be actually *achieved* by ideas and work.<br>
3) "Don't get indignant" is like the "Stifle your feelings and<br>
   discuss in logical, emotion-neutral terms" nerd meme I've discussed<br>
   here before.  How nerds convince themselves to conform.  I believe in<br>
   at least trying to be polite, but in the privacy of my own heart I'm<br>
   pissed at jerks trying to tighten the screws and bring the world a<br>
   little closer to a concentration camp, whether out of evil or out of<br>
   daisy-eyed-foolishness--but fool-Nazis make me the more pissed...In<br>
   case you want to talk about how I feel.  But leaving that aside,<br>
4) The particular case is the idea of *adding* a new compulsion that is<br>
   not one of the hard-to-get-rid-of cases like defense against war.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Maybe you have a "right" to absolute freedom from the interference of</i><br>
<i>&gt;others.  So what?  It's irrelevant if it's impractical.  It's childish</i><br>
<i>&gt;to get upset because you don't have something that you can't have.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe we can build these Utopias, but only with a complete restructuring</i><br>
<i>&gt;of our society and culture.  Just grabbing at "rights" willy-nilly will</i><br>
<i>&gt;probably not do it.</i><br>
<p>
Besides the *general* "oh shucks it's no use hoping" message here, Phil<br>
seems to be saying specifically that incrementally improving things is no<br>
use.  I can't disagree with you more, Phil.  Every little bit of freedom<br>
counts, as does every bit of compulsion.  Your pessimism about anarchy<br>
doesn't justify more government intrusion.  We don't have to wait to make<br>
things better.  We don't have to make things worse while we wait.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And it seems to me you should allow, in your broad formulation of rights,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that people have the right to build communities as they see fit, including</i><br>
<i>&gt;ones that use compulsion, as long as they allow people to leave those</i><br>
<i>&gt;communities.  If there are no non-compulsory communities out there for you</i><br>
<i>&gt;to go to, well, that's too bad, but maybe it's evolution in action.</i><br>
<p>
Well, no.  No one has a right to come into a place and build their<br>
"community" by violating the (narrow?) rights of the residents.<br>
Once again, your idea of "broadening" verges on passively accepting<br>
whatever happens to be going on politically.  But the steamroller of the<br>
state doesn't need a broadened idea of "rights" to justify what it does.<br>
That's not what the idea of "rights" was invented for.  Rights were<br>
invented to defend the individual *against* "the community".<br>
<p>
Phil, you seem to imagine this positive thing called "the community" that<br>
is not raw state power--yet uses it.  I say there's no such nice thing.<br>
There is people getting along like neighbors, doing things as neighbors--<br>
that's true community--and there's the state, a social corrosive.  In<br>
between are people who confuse the two and do bad things with good<br>
intentions.  All of us who don't know how to achieve perfect anarchy<br>
right away can be considered in that middle category.  We are cooperating<br>
with evil because we haven't yet learned how to stop.  But we can at least<br>
refrain from the things we know are wrong.<br>
