&lt; The current evidence seems to support the notion that economic <br>

the  case?  It is not inconcievable that advances in complex adaptive<br>
systems theory, or some other discipline, may lead to the discovery of<br>
"lever points" within economies that would allow articulate control of<br>
economic rescources without the fear of collapse.  Economists and<br>
scientists (evil ones, no doubt) could provide policy makers with<br>
indefinately sustainable socialist economic policies.&gt;<br>
<p>
As someone pointed out recently (actually Eugene forwarding a Miller<br>
post from the Hayek list), Mark Miller addressed this notion of being<br>
able to find useful leverage points for the economy in his 9612<br>
_Reason_ magazine critique of John Holland’s _Hidden Order_ (see<br>
<a href="http://www.reasonmag.com/9612/bk.miller.html">http://www.reasonmag.com/9612/bk.miller.html</a> )<br>
<p>
&lt; Surprisingly, what Holland presents as the chief contribution his<br>
work can make in economics is to help us identify "lever points" for<br>
fixing economic problems. [SNIP] <br>
<p>
This is the familiar central-planning fantasy, and everything the book<br>
says on the matter has already been well answered by Hayek. [SNIP] <br>
<p>
In the market, the intervener is of no greater intelligence than the<br>
creatures populating the system, and of substantially lesser<br>
intelligence than the system as a whole. Worse, the information within<br>
the system cannot be gathered together. This is the Hayekian<br>
"knowledge problem," and it cannot be sufficiently emphasized. No one<br>
can ever succeed, no matter how totalitarian their control, at<br>
bringing together in one place the dispersed information that<br>
individuals and market structures are locally adapting to but are<br>
mostly unaware of. Holland endows his learning systems with a large<br>
population so the resulting system can learn more, and can behave in<br>
ways that take more knowledge into account. If a smaller population of<br>
creatures were given levers for controlling a larger population, this<br>
would simply reduce the aggregate intelligence of the system toward<br>
that of the smaller population. &gt;<br>
<p>
So, even well-meaning attempts to pry at these 'leverage points'<br>
should only show the futility and increase the scatter of adaptations<br>
and work-arounds that thwart the central plan.<br>
