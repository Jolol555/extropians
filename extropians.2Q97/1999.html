<i>&gt; In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to </i><br>
<i>&gt; kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. </i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately,  I don't believe this is true.  There have evolved <br>
systems of memes whose *sole* purpose is to get you to value killing <br>
the other guy *more than your own life* (let alone net worth).  <br>
Examples include certain muslim beliefs about jihad and paradise,  <br>
the christian Crusades, Maoist revolutionary theory, and the <br>
extremely sophisticated psychological manipulation in Army and Marine <br>
basic training.  "A rational army *would* run".<br>
<p>
I think this severely undercuts the economic arguments for PPL's.  I <br>
do have hope that a society of long living individuals will make PPLs <br>
possible, though.  Its no accident that historically, war and <br>
revolution have relied on teenagers who have little concept of their <br>
own mortality.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Jews  would be willing to pay as </i><br>
<i>&gt; much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%. </i><br>
<p>
Ah, but what if you can con someone else into paying the price for <br>
you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As a result the PPA protecting Jews  would be much stronger than the one that </i><br>
<i>&gt; wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you </i><br>
<i>&gt; (like not getting  killed) you have much more influence than just one man </i><br>
<i>&gt; one vote.   </i><br>
<p>
Well, that's not saying much.  Any 14 year old with dreams of glory <br>
and an AK-47 has much more influence than "one man, one vote".<br>
