<i>&gt; I have not slipped into solipsism but...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For operation of my bio-computer in the 'real' world I have to choose a</i><br>
<i>&gt; game/ritual/theory (which deep down I know to be a lie). Progress has</i><br>
<i>&gt; become hard as I refuse to stick to any one emic reality for any length of</i><br>
<i>&gt; time. This is good, I am less intolerant of other people and their reality</i><br>
<i>&gt; tunnels, but bad as progress is slowed almost to a stop.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I was wondering if any other extropians had similar difficulties in</i><br>
<i>&gt; finding a framework of solid beliefs. At the moment my only solid belief</i><br>
<i>&gt; is that all my beliefs are constantly in flux.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Just wondering...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; M.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "It is my firm belief that it is a mistake to hold firm beliefs"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I ask myself, 'how can we move forward if we have no firm beliefs to</i><br>
<i>&gt; spring from?'</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

I think anyone who puts any thought at all into the nature of reality and<br>
epistemology will go through some dark nihilistic stage... angst, I<br>
guess.  I know I did.  Realizing the fact that this is an angst suffered<br>
by basically anyone who has thought about life is not so commonplace.  I<br>
would have appreciated a teacher telling me that philisophical angst was<br>
normal back in high school.  I don't think getting over this angst<br>
necessarily means forming some new philosophy that claims to find the<br>
"truth", it simply requires that you except that no knowledge is sacred or<br>
a foundation except for the existence of self.  It can be a comforting<br>
thought when you think of how much bullshit there is in the memes sent to<br>
you every day by the media.  It's nice to know that everyone could be<br>
"wrong," that it all could be a big dream... I find that more comforting<br>
than the "truth" some religions will sell me. <br>

Re: progress....  <br>
<p>
	I think you are measuring progress using the religious sense of<br>
the word, that we are finding more and more "truth" and this will somehow<br>
allow us to understand the universe in some divine way.  I see progress as<br>
the increase of *useable* information, and I don't see why there needs to<br>
be truth except for those who don't have the strength to exist with<br>
criticizable, temporary beliefs.  In science, there are models to explain<br>
phenomena, but no one claims that those models are a direct<br>
representation of reality, they are simply a tool that we find useful in<br>
analyzing and using the workings of the universe.  They are an<br>
approximation, and sometimes a very bad one.  I see no problem with this,<br>
science is not a religion, it is not about beliefs, science is simply a<br>
tool.<br>
