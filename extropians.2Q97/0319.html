 1) Formal complaints and administrative requests should be sent to:<br>
<p>
	postmaster@extropy.org<br>
<p>
 2a) Mail to the list should be sent to:<br>
<p>
	extropians@extropy.org<br>
<p>
 2b) The software that processes traffic on the list alters the mail headers<br>
 so that all correctly working mail readers will automatically address<br>
 replies BACK to the LIST. [reply-to: extropians@extropy.org]<br>
<p>
 2c) If you want to reply to an individual poster you should manually address<br>
 a reply. If the post does not have a signature line, viewing the message<br>
 in a text editor should help you determine the sender's address.<br>
<p>
 2d) It is strongly recommend but not required that all list members use a<br>
 signature file containing their e-mail address.<br>
<p>
 3) Due to the volume of list traffic please restrain yourself from over-<br>
 quoting  previous posts -- just a couple of lines to re-cap for those  who <br>
 weren't paying attention is usually sufficient.<br>
<p>
 4) The list is conceived as a forum for the exchange of new information<br>
 and techniques, and not as a forum for debating the  basics. We do have<br>
 our disagreements -- often quite lively ones -- but rarely about really<br>
 basic issues. Arguments in favor of socialized medicine or dying a <br>
 natural death at age sixty are, judging by past experience, likely to be<br>
 refuted, and finally ignored.<br>
<p>
 5) Traffic on this mailing list can run quite high. We like to keep the <br>
 signal- to-noise ratio as high as we can, so please restrain the impulse<br>
 to post "me-too" messages or ad hominem flames to the list at large.<br>
 If you cannot resist engaging in such discourse, please do so<br>
 in private e-mail.<br>
<p>
 5b) Posts about the list, or its rules, should have the pre-fix "META:"<br>
  We encourage the use of other prefixes indicating the content of a post.<br>
 Examples include, PHIL:, MATH:, SCI:, CHAT:, etc.<br>
<p>
 5c) Polls being submitted to list members will have the "POLL:"<br>
 prefix.<br>
<p>
 5d) Rules about fighting and insulting; fighting and insulting <br>
 are not allowed!<br>
<p>
 5e) If someone starts a fight with you what should you do?; we have a<br>
 private legal code set-up to handle such disputes which includes a<br>
 judge (the List Administrator) and an adjudicator to handle appeals.<br>
<p>
 If someone really annoys you, you can do any of the following:<br>
 1) Nothing - give no response<br>
 2) Respond OFF the list<br>
 5) Make a formal complaint to me asking for a judgment against Person X<br>
<p>
 5f) What if you just have to respond to "up hold your honor" or to set <br>
 the "facts/record straight," or to tell the entire list why you<br>
 will not be speaking or reading posts or messages from the person who<br>
 offended you?<br>
<p>
 D O N ' T!<br>
<p>
 we consider such responses flames in their own right and you would<br>
 be taking the law into your own hands; you might also be censured or<br>
 removed from the list.<br>
<p>
Remember:<br>
 Don't contribute to or continue a fight once one has started.<br>
 doing so places you in violation of the list rules. That includes <br>
 meta communication, which includes posts with an angry tone, or voice.<br>
