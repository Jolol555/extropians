<i>&gt; minimal time-discount (i.e. maximal patience), and Bayesian beliefs</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the smallest relative entropy to the truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The Hansson &amp; Stuart paper tries to infer the gender and age specific</i><br>
<i>&gt; time discount values that were an equilibrium in our tribal past.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They note that on average sexual reproduction in a stable population</i><br>
<i>&gt; should prefer a discount rate of a factor of 2 per generation (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; fits with historic interest rates), but find that for tribal humans it</i><br>
<i>&gt; varies with age and gender.  Young males, for example, discount the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future heavily, in contrast to children and men over 35.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't have a cite, but I think there are also good reasons to think</i><br>
<i>&gt; that young males should be risk-takers rather than risk-averse.  On</i><br>
<i>&gt; average though one would expect only slight risk-aversion from sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduction, except for small genetic populations.</i><br>
<p>
While I would say that family concerns make males much more risk averse<br>
than without such responsibility. It is an evolutionary goal of males to<br>
pile up as big a pile of stuff, as pretty a nest as possible, in order<br>
to attract the closest to optimal mate. This factor does vary in<br>
relation to the males short term libidinous drives, as well as to what a<br>
particular male considers his "optimal" mate and what his preexisting<br>
assets physically and charismatically are (shades of your BS ability<br>
theory below)<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I also have a theory that young males should be more optimistic than</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bayesians; the better they think of their prospects the more likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are to fool young women into thinking highly of their prospects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
So liars have an evolutionary advantage over Bayesians?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As we become better at exchanging information in ways other than via</i><br>
<i>&gt; sexual reproduction, it seems the longer time-horizon of asexual</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduction should win out.  This suggests a future of very patient</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk-averse asexual Bayesians, in contrast to the impatient optimistic</i><br>
<i>&gt; risk-taking young males who dominate science fiction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
So you are saying that the future portends being boringly stable, with<br>
high social pressures for conformity (if you reproduce asexually, you<br>
are producing identical clones) with low growth, low interest, long term<br>
investments being the norm. I predict that such a society will not<br>
survive long in the face of possible world ecological disasters, threats<br>
from within or without. Its stability and conformity will not make it<br>
suitable to adapt to radical changes. The machine will stop. Get me off<br>
this rock ASAP.<br>
