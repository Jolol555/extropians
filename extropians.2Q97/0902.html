Max,<br>
<p>
You make the rules, and I'm not going to try and break them just for the<br>
sake of it, but I disagree that there are certain topics that should not be<br>
discussed on this list. Even the basics should be questioned from time to<br>
time. Since you defined extropy, and outlined most of the principles, it is<br>
your job to vigorously defend them in debate, rather than outlawing<br>
discussions. If you take the standpoint that there are certain principles<br>
that cannot be questioned, you are no different to the Spanish Inquisition.<br>
Extropy is going to come under a huge attack from certain section of the<br>
community in the future, once the meme really starts to propagate, so you<br>
had better get used to it.<br>
<p>
I wish to point out that I respect you and your creative/analytical mind<br>
and I agree with most of the extropian principles. Furthermore this post<br>
does not in any way constitute a personal attack.<br>

<i>&gt;This discussion does not belong on the Extropians mailing list. If Erik and</i><br>
<i>&gt;others want to argue about whether free markets or state control are best</i><br>
<i>&gt;for poor children, take it to the Transhuman list, or some other place.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The list rules are very clear about this. Eric broke the rules. I ask</i><br>
<i>&gt;others not to respond to his posts on this topic here. Let's keep this list</i><br>
<i>&gt;for its intended purpose.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Erik, your comment about religious cults was asinine and uncalled for. Do</i><br>
<i>&gt;you publish articles on totally irrelevant topics in Homo Excelsior? Would</i><br>
<i>&gt;you publish an article comparing two makes of automobile, or a how-to guide</i><br>
<i>&gt;on brick-laying? Didn't think. So please respect the founding principles of</i><br>
<i>&gt;our list. Extropians love to debate economic issues, but this list is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;the place for this discussion.</i><br>
