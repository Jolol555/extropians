The higher the velocity with which a rocket pushes out its exhaust, the more<br>
oomph it gets for a given amount of fuel.  Ion rockets push out their fuel<br>
very fast, much faster than chemical rockets, so they are much more sparing<br>
of fuel than chemical rockets.  Unfortunately, they cannot produce nearly as<br>
much thrust for the same size rocket engine.  So whereas the typical<br>
chemical rocket runs through tons of fuel in a few minutes, blasting to the<br>
stars on a collosal column of flame, the typical ion engine slurps up a tiny<br>
amount of fuel over hours or days, and produces an invisible wisp of very<br>
hot exhaust that provides almost no force.  But a tiny force accumulated<br>
over a long period can result in a higher final velocity than a mighty blast<br>
that doesn't last very long.<br>
<p>
An ion rocket is typically about the size of a coffee cup (they range from<br>
demitasse to commuter mug sizes).  At the bottom of the cup is a little oven<br>
or electric arc that heats a liquid metal propellant.  This vaporizes the<br>
propellant and knocks off one or more electrons of the metal atoms,<br>
producing  positively charged ions.  Across the top of the cup is a grid,<br>
like a window screen, that is negatively charged relative to the oven.  The<br>
positive ions are attracted to the negative grid, so they whiz towards it<br>
very fast.  Most of them miss the wires in the grid and pass through the<br>
holes, whereupon they shoot off into space, bewildered.<br>
<p>
Ion engines need a source of electric power, like solar cells or a nuclear<br>
generator.  They use high voltages, on the order of 1000V, so they need a<br>
gizmo to convert low-voltage to high-voltage electricity.  All this adds<br>
weight, complexity and unreliability to the spacecraft.   On the other hand,<br>
when they fail, they don't blow up, as chemical rockets are prone to. <br>
<p>
Ion rockets have been commercially available for about 30 years.  They are<br>
mostly used for satellite stationkeeping, i.e. making small adjustments in<br>
orbit to keep satellites where they should be.  In theory they shoud be good<br>
for interplanetary missions, but nobody wants to risk their mission with a<br>
new technology, so it hasn't been tried.<br>
<p>
There is reason to believe that, like most electrostatic gizmos, ion engines<br>
get better as they get smaller.  Eric Drexler came up with a (vague) design<br>
for a teeny-tiny solar powered ion engine, a few microns across.  They would<br>
be deployed in vast arrays that would look and act like cloth.  You'd make a<br>
parachute-shape out of this cloth, on the order of a kilometer across, hang<br>
your payload and fuel tanks from the parachute strings, and off you'd go.<br>
Such a device would have incredible oomph.  It would make travel to other<br>
planets quick and easy.  He alluded to such a design in an article in the<br>
Journal of The British Interplanetary Society, but I guess the design didn't<br>
meet his standards of impeccably detailed feasibility studies, because he<br>
hasn't published anything about it since.  I did some analysis on this idea,<br>
and it seem feasible provided you can suppress arcing between the grid and<br>
the ion emitter, which gets into areas of plasma physics I don't understand.<br>
