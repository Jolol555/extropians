I will rephrase my questions since the answers I am getting<br>
are more abstract than I had in mind.<br>
<p>
If you could make 100K per year at a job of your choosing<br>
(MI, aging, writing, whatever) or double that income every<br>
six months (200k, 400k, 800k, etc.) selling cars 10 hours <br>
per day, which would you pick?  If you picked the car job <br>
at what point would you stop or cut back on your hours?<br>
<p>
I don't mean this to be an abstract question I am curious<br>
about people's strategies regarding the place of money<br>
in their longevity plans. At some point the cost of <br>
acquiring dollars exceeds their value.<br>
<p>
Every now and then someone waves a job in my face that pays<br>
large amounts of money and takes a lot of time.  I keep saying<br>
no, because I think my time is more important and that I <br>
can make money at something that also has a lot of other <br>
fringe benefits related to living longer.  I'm just<br>
doing a reality check here by asking other people's outlooks.<br>
Obviously these are individual decisions but I might learn<br>
something from other people's experiences with money and<br>
work.<br>
<p>
Work in the field of life extension is clearly valuable<br>
and I am much better suited for it than other sorts of<br>
work but it is quicker and simpler to make money in<br>
more mundane ways.  Given my values and logic this does<br>
not make any sense but the market does not have my values<br>
and does not seem as rational.  <br>
<p>
I am looking at is the value of dollars in hand verses<br>
the value of time to do other things.  I have thought<br>
enough about this to realize that for me it graphs as<br>
a exponential curve with plateaus at various places.<br>
<p>
There is little I can think of that benefits my day to day<br>
life which cost more than about 150K per year.  Sure more<br>
would be nice but not compared to the hours it takes to<br>
get it.  The relatively expensive things I can think of to<br>
do are no more interesting than the relatively inexpensive<br>
ones so until I change my brain I can have all the fun and<br>
learning and skill development I have time for without a<br>
lot of money.<br>
<p>
Beyond personal spending I can think of many things I can do<br>
with money but I am less clear how much it cost to get a<br>
given benefit that would be meaningful to me.  I don't know<br>
a lot about who I might hire to do what work that would help<br>
my longevity more than my own efforts could.<br>
<p>
Of course there isn't a limit to how much money is enough<br>
if you are talking about free money but there are tradeoffs <br>
between making money and doing other things with your<br>
time.  Not everything can be bought with money some things <br>
take direct effort (physical fitness, health, knowledge).  <br>
I don't know that Einstein could have hired someone to figure <br>
out relativity or that Ralph Merkle would be better off as <br>
the CEO of Coca-Cola.<br>
<p>
I can assign a dollar value to almost anything but that does<br>
not mean that all of the value I receive is in dollars or<br>
can be bought for dollars.  I have had more money in the<br>
past but I have never been better off, there are other things<br>
in life.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Will<br>
