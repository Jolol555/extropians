Uh, I don't think that means what you think it means... or at least that's<br>
not my dictionary's definition. It's certainly not what I think it means. <br>

<p>
Um, I still don't understand the question 8-(. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The point being, that when</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans began making and using machines extensively, they had a mechanistic</i><br>

<i>&gt; very complex item.</i><br>
<p>
But if it's not just a machine, then what is it? I've met many people who<br>
tell me 'But the brain isn't a computer', or 'But the body isn't a<br>
machine', but none of them have ever been able to tell me what they are.<br>
I'll accept that we might have 'souls' who sneak into our bodies through<br>
quantum mechanical effects, but that seems to be the only other option. <br>

<p>
Why? You mean that if I climbed 99% of the way up Mt Everest I'd have no<br>
idea of how to get to the top or what it would be like up there? <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 	It also sounds like Joseph Campbells' "follow your bliss".</i><br>
<p>
Or Bach's comments on 'selfishness' in 'Illusions', or Leary's, or a lot<br>
of existentialist writing. They're all looking at the same problems and<br>
finding the same solution. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; We have seen this too.  Perhaps if they first understood themselves, they</i><br>
<i>&gt; would also understand their habits.</i><br>
<p>
Which rather fits into the other threads about ambitions and gender roles.<br>
Most of my friends from school seem to have wandered into random roles<br>
outside of their choosing, because they simply didn't have a clue as to<br>
what they really wanted from life. This seems to be a much greater danger<br>
than setting out to do great things against all the odds. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; "...chagrin..."   disappointment....comes from expectation....this</i><br>

<p>
Hmm... I'm not sure of what you're saying. Crowley knew an awful lot and<br>
did an awful lot. His problem was expecting that people would admire him<br>
for it. Well, that and wanting to be the Anti-Christ when he wasn't. Now<br>
that's one ambition which probably should be stopped early on ;-). <br>
