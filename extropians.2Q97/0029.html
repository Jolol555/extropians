I'm somewhat disappointed by the sorts of responses that were sent to<br>
Anonymous' original message about extropians who "talk the talk but<br>
don't walk the walk", and my subsequent message on the same topic.<br>
<p>
There were a couple of what I term knee-jerk objectivist responses<br>
(which I was not entirely shocked to see), and a couple of platitudes<br>
like "selfishness isn't measured in dollars".<br>
<p>
However, it doesn't appear that many people have been able to<br>
contradict the fundamental premise, which is that many (though<br>
certainly not all!) extropian types don't seem to actively work<br>
towards their long term financial self interest, or their long term<br>
physical survival.<br>
<p>
I suppose that since I "knew" the correctness of my position (who<br>
doesn't believe their own ideas?) I was not expecting to learn that in<br>
fact virtually all extropians are taking care of their health and<br>
finances and such. However, I suppose I was expecting something more<br>
spirited than the kind of reply that one could readily have expected<br>
from Ayn Rand when defending her decision to keep chain smoking even<br>
though it was obviously killing her.<br>
<p>
I personally try to maintain a very flexible outlook on<br>
life. Dogmatically clinging to one's views because they are one's own<br>
has a great deal of psychological appeal but it isn't very survival<br>
oriented -- one has to be skeptical of one's own views as well as<br>
those of others.<br>
<p>
Years ago, when Tim May gave me the "if you're so smart, why aren't<br>
you rich" speech, I took him seriously, accepted without letting my<br>
ego get in the way that I'd been screwing up my finances for some<br>
time, and decided to work on that problem instead of wasting time<br>
posting messages to the net all day. I have not yet entirely succeeded<br>
in my goals in this area, but I've made substantial progress, and<br>
would not have made any had I not recognised that a problem existed.<br>
<p>
I would suggest that many people here would be better off consciously<br>
applying Popperian pan-critical rationalism to their own lives rather<br>
than treating wake up calls like the one "Anonymous" posted as foreign<br>
concepts to be rejected by the ego's immune system without<br>
consideration.<br>
<p>
Doubtless, the knowledge that one might harbor behaviors antithetical<br>
to one's self interest is painful -- but are not the consequences of<br>
persisting in such behaviors far worse?<br>
<p>
