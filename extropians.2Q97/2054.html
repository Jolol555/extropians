<i>&gt; I know of no evidence that the stars we see are _not_ inside Dyson</i><br>
<i>&gt; spheres ... [snip]</i><br>
<p>
  A paranoid designer might indeed fake the appearance of a star, but<br>
a straightforward approach results in the star's energy being<br>
re-emitted from a solid surface (possibly one in many small pieces)<br>
whose total area is vastly larger than that of the star.  Thus the<br>
energy flux emitted per unit area is much smaller than for the star,<br>
the temperature of the emitter is vastly lower, and the spectrum is<br>
substantially different.  Thus a Dyson sphere whose diameter was 100<br>
times its star's, would have surface area 10000 times its star's, and<br>
temperature (via the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law) ten times less.<br>
<p>
  Those stars for which we have been able to measure diameters<br>
(either directly, with interferometers, or indirectly, by watching<br>
eclipsing binaries or measuring spectral broadening and rotational<br>
period, or by other means), have diameters in essence consistent<br>
with just plain stars.<br>
<p>
  Furthermore, unless the energy is ultimately radiated at a lower<br>
temperature than that of the original emitter, one cannot get much<br>
useful work out of it as it goes by.<br>
<p>
  Of course, a Dyson-sphere designer might have designed a small<br>
sphere, and have raised the temperature of the star inside it enough<br>
to allow extraction of lots of work from the energy on the way out, or<br>
merely faked a slightly cooler star than was actually present.  But I<br>
think present-day astronomy pretty well rules out the hypothesis that<br>
a substantial fraction of stars are surrounded by large, "unstealthed"<br>
Dyson spheres of the kind Dyson originally discussed (which more<br>
nearly resembled dense swarms of asteroids than solid spheres, I<br>
recall...).  And if there are lots of spheres that are stealthed, I am<br>
not sure I want to know what they are hiding from.<br>
