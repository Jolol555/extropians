In the morning paper here in San Diego where the cult suicides are still<br>
for some reason considered newsworthy, there was a passing reference to <br>
extropians.  Evidently one of the suicides had a copy of 'The Extropian'<br>
in his possesions ( at his parent's home - not at the scene ).  It was<br>
referred to as the writings of a "Santa Monica based internet cult",<br>
which advocated, among other things, "Cryogenics, smart drugs, and <br>
upgrading".<br>
<p>
A few other tidbits:<br>
<p>
In the words of a cult 'expert' who was interviewed, "...the 'singularity'<br>
prophesied by extropians is a example of the 'Impending Doom' technique<br>
frequently used by cult leaders..." <br>
<p>
"Extropian literature names no date for the event, and Los Angeles county <br>
and Santa Monica city authorities reported no group suicides recently, <br>
but sources in the L.A. County Sherriff's office confirmed that the group<br>
was being investigated."<br>
