I tried a food-combining diet by a Frenchman called Michel Montignac,<br>
which is quite well known in Europe.  Subjectively I felt great and<br>
slimmed down quite a lot - although that might be mainly because he<br>
recommended cutting out anything with sugar altogether.  His idea is to<br>
cut out stuff like potatoes and rice and refined flour breads altogether<br>
; occasionally eat wholemeal bread on its own with almost nothing else;<br>
for main meals eat vegetables + a bit of meat; and lots of fruit, but<br>
separately from anything else.  The diet was very much a gourmet sort of<br>
diet (it allowed oddities like nibbling cheese whenever you like, and a<br>
bit of red wine and pure chocolate every now and then - very French!).<br>
<p>
I drifted out of it because it was just too difficult to sustain around<br>
the kind of work I was doing (temping), where sandwiches and junk food are<br>
the norm.<br>
<p>
It seems to me that the main plausibility about food combining is that<br>
our ancestors wouldn't have been likely to have had combinations of food<br>
at all - they would probably have gorged themselves on one kind of food<br>
at a time, as they found it.  Right or wrong?<br>
