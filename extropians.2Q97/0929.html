<i>&gt; I've had extropian ideas for a long time and when I found out that</i><br>
<i>&gt; there was an extropian movement, I thought "Great!  There are people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who think like me!  Perhaps are they going to help me grow faster."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But all I see on web pages and all I read in this mailing list's</i><br>
<i>&gt; messages are theories or general ideas.</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, a bit of a problem isn't it?<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, there are only a few reasonable places to apply one's<br>
efforts as things stand: life extension, self improvement (mental,<br>
physical and resource improvement all come to mind) and political<br>
efforts.<br>
<p>
Life Extension is actually one of the easy places to attack -- simply<br>
switching to a very low fat diet (vegan is easiest), quitting smoking,<br>
and exercising will get you a long, long way. I also take antioxidants<br>
(including vitamin E), a general ironless multivitamin supplement<br>
(excess iron is linked to heart disease), and chromium picolinate. I<br>
may start taking more things as I age.<br>
<p>
I also am signed up for cryonics, which is a bit of an insurance<br>
policy. I hope never to have to be frozen, but if something happens to<br>
me, I'd prefer not to be dead.<br>
<p>
I also contribute heavily to libertarian political causes, although I<br>
am much less personally active than I used to be. I think at this<br>
point, I do better specializing in my field and contributing a couple<br>
of hours of earnings to Cato than spending tens of hours on amateur<br>
politics.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think it would be good to be a bit more practical about</i><br>
<i>&gt; extropianism.  I'd really like to read information on where to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; drugs that can make you think faster or feel a certain way.  Such</i><br>
<i>&gt; drugs are sometimes legal and available to the public, but we just</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know about them.  Putting an end to this kind of ignorance would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be beneficial to us.  Understanding how the drugs work on us could</i><br>
<i>&gt; further our knowledge of ourselves and truly make us grow.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not particularly sanguine about the current generation of "smart<br>
drugs" -- thus far, most of the reports people have put out on the<br>
subject have been of the form "well, it might have made a slight<br>
difference, but..."<br>
<p>
On the other hand, drugs like Deprinyl (sp?) probably make a long term<br>
difference in preserving mental acuity as we age.<br>
<p>
As for other sorts of drugs, well, most people are reluctant to talk<br>
about them, the political and legal situation being what it is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What I'm saying is that it may be nice to dream about things, but it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; better to do things, to apply theories, to build upon what's already</i><br>
<i>&gt; built.  What I'd like to see is an "extropian resource guide" of some</i><br>
<i>&gt; sort in which one could find information that could be immediately</i><br>
<i>&gt; used to expand one's physical and intellectual capacities.</i><br>
<p>
Well... perhaps you have a project for yourself. The rest of us might<br>
not be sufficiently motivated, but as long as you are willing to<br>
contribute such a section to the FAQ, please do!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sure, I want to be a cyborg, but right now, precisely what can science</i><br>
<i>&gt; and technology make me?</i><br>
<p>
It can help you extend your life so that you'll be around to enjoy the<br>
benefits of mid 21st century technology.<br>
<p>
It can help you get a "safety net" in the form of cryonics in case<br>
nothing else works and you deanimate anyway.<br>
<p>
It can help you, if you are clever enough, to grow wealthy and thus<br>
gain resources with which to achieve your dreams.<br>
<p>
Unfortunately, it can't do a lot else for you -- yet. We are just<br>
starting to peer into the future -- we haven't gotten there yet.<br>
