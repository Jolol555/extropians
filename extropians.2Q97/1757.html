When I say aging is the number one problem what I mean is that of all<br>
the things that might kill me it is the most certain given current<br>
technology and may be the easiest major problem to fix.  It is the one<br>
thing that is not just a gamble but a deadline.  If I get to the point<br>
that I can make a really good argument that aging will be solved before<br>
it gets in my way then I will cease to focus on it.  For a while I<br>
assumed it would be but then I realize that I was just making an<br>
educated guess not a rigorous argument.<br>
<p>
Your current emphasis, rephrased as "what do we do about all the unfriendly<br>
natives," is certainly a candidate for my number two long term concern and<br>
understanding said natives is one of the better steps towards a solution.<br>
I have been studying these natives a little bit each day and I do<br>
feel I am starting to understand them better but not enough to make a<br>
major impact.  <br>
<p>
If you have a talent in that area I think it's a very good thing to be<br>
doing.  I don't seem to have any particular talent and seem to do best at<br>
whatever I spend the most hours on, so I try to prioritize things (and have<br>
logged an unconscionable number of hours doing so). When I do get a chance<br>
to influence others I'll suggest they avoid bickering and focus on taking <br>
care of basics and eliminating aging, unless they have a particular talent <br>
in some other productive area which I would hate to waste.<br>
 <br>
Other candidates for number two are: accidents (not so bad if you are<br>
careful and optimal solutions require social changes and reengineered<br>
bodies), diseases (this one actually gets lots of attention from<br>
science already), personal violence (not to bad if you live in a good <br>
neighborhood), and environmental and resource issues (which I don't<br>
know a lot about).  There are also lots of things that are not problems<br>
to be solved but rather generally useful tools or opportunities.<br>
<p>
Wait a minute.  Michael Butler, are you the fellow who is working on<br>
increasing cryonics memberships?  If so that's great, keep it up.<br>
If you sell people on cryonics (in addition to the fringe benefit of<br>
having them maybe not die) they might actually start thinking about<br>
living a long time and that could get them to start behaving more<br>
reasonably.<br>
