<p>
 I see your point now, and it is a reasonable goal for the average<br>
investor, but index funds as they exist today aren't trying to track<br>
an average person's investments. They're trying to track the average<br>
stock and/or bond portfolio. It isn't as easy for the average person<br>
to emulate an average investment in a home.<br>
