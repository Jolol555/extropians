All ideas should not get equal attention for some are more logical than <br>
others.  Those with more probability of success or truth should be mulled <br>
over more than those of lesser probability.  The expression of an idea at <br>
least denotes thought process and should be applauded...if it is illogical <br>
or lacking in substance then those who have a more mature level of <br>
reasoning should point out the flaws, NOT dismiss the individuals effort <br>
off-hand.  My argument about 'stupid' ideas may come down to semantics.  I <br>
define 'stupid' as doing something you know is wrong (smoking, driving <br>
aggressively, not pulling in front of a large truck rig and slamming on the <br>
brakes, etc) or not doing something you know is correct (being responsible, <br>
having manners,  etc).  'Dumb' is just not knowing.<br>
<p>
A child putting its hand into a candle flame is dumb (the first time <br>
anyway).  Me putting my hand into a candle flame would be stupid.<br>
<p>
I remember having my idea of putting video with audio on laser disks called <br>
stupid by my roommate in 1975.  A few years later my idea for moving this <br>
video/audio fantasy to a cable TV channel was stupid.  The early-80's I had <br>
this 'stupid' idea of yet another cable channel...this one catering to my <br>
science-fiction addiction.  The late 80's found my stupidity <br>
overwhelming....ideas of using computers to enhance movies (fantasy about <br>
having Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade character disgusted with Columbo over <br>
Marilyn Monroe as the murderess).  My friends and relatives thought all my <br>
ideas unworthy but someone else had friends and family who didn't, and they <br>
are now in far better financial means.<br>
<p>
Many ideas cannot be classed 'stupid' until after their implementation. <br>
 Let me ask a question.  Was the idea of nuclear power stupid or dumb?<br>

quoth David Laws<br>
: An idea must be expressed and debated before it can be finally classed<br>
: 'stupid'.  A 'doctor' in the 18th century would have considered the idea <br>
of<br>
: NOT bleeding an ailing individual 'stupid'.<br>
<p>
Fine.  Is it okay if I make an initial estimate of an idea's stupidity,<br>
and concentrate on the least-stupid-appearing first, or do you insist that<br>
all ideas get equal attention until PROVEN stupid?<br>
