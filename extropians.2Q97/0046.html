<i>&gt;</i><br>
The title story of Banks' recent collection of Culture short stories,<br>
'State of the Art', and a few of the other stories in there, are all<br>
about this.  (There's also a great anticapitalist rant in State of the<br>
Art itself!) <br>
<p>
It's not so much that there's a lack of things to do in the Culture,<br>
it's that there's a lack of any *reason* to do *anything*. Everything's<br>
too easy, or has already been done; while  part of the fun of life is<br>
overcoming the world's 'resistance', having something to*push against* -<br>
a cliche, I know, but nevertheless true. (Have you come across the work<br>
of a psychologist called Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi?)<br>
<p>
As we are now, struggle and all, we might say it's a fair trade: give up<br>
the dubious Daoistic blessings of life's troublesomeness for the<br>
tangible benefits of the Culture.  But, as Banks toys with in State of<br>
the Art, people who have lived in the Culture might see it the other way.<br>
<p>
(Interestingly reminiscent of theological arguments about evil, this!)<br>
<p>
At any rate, I stand by saying that the Culture, while a possible peak<br>
in cultural design space, isn't a peak we could get to by a socialist<br>
(planned/skyhooks) path, but only by a capitalist (Darwinian/cranes)<br>
path. Actually I think that's Banks' only delusion, and that the Culture<br>
is, pretty much as you say, a possible Beyond type of cultural form, and<br>
on the whole an attractive one.  In my criticism of it, I was mixing up<br>
a critique of Banks' fervent anticapitalism with a critique of the<br>
Culture as a possible social design.<br>
