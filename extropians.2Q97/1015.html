<i>&gt;Rats fed high-fat but low calorie diets do about as well as rats fed low-fat</i><br>
<i>&gt;low-calorie diets.  So the conclusion is that the *primary* health</i><br>
<i>&gt;disadvantage of fat is that it makes you eat more.</i><br>
<p>
I don't see how you come to this conclusion based on facts you give. I used<br>
to have a diet relatively high in fat and I found that fat satisfied my<br>
hunger rather than stimulated it. Wouldn't it be simpler to say that these<br>
studies show that there is a health advantage gained by having a low<br>
*quantity* of fat in your diet: you can achieve this either by having a low<br>
proportion of fat in a high calorie diet, or a large (or low) amount of fat<br>
in a low-calorie diet.<br>
<p>
I also thought that studies showed that the life-extension properties of a<br>
low calorie diet went we beyond just having a low quantity of fat in your<br>
diet; say the difference b/w living to 90 on a low-fat diet and 130 on a<br>
low-calorie diet (i.e. low-fat helps you reach your max. life span,<br>
low-calorie actually slows the aging process and thus extend your life span<br>
significantly).<br>
<p>
Can anyone clarify this?<br>
<p>
best,   patrick<br>
