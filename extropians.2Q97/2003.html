     Eric Watt Forste responds:<br>
     Yeah, the motives of legislators and bureaucrats are so much nobler <br>
     and purer than the motives of businessmen, we'd better make sure they <br>
     have veto power over what gets said. I'd much rather be brainwashed by <br>
     Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich than by Hugh Hefner or Bill Gates, <br>
     wouldn't you?<br>
     <br>
     (Hint: I'm being sardonic.)<br>
     <br>
     Rick replies:<br>
     <br>
     Really?  I couldn't detect! &lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     But, seriously, your point is...?  Actually, I see your point but it <br>
     doesn't sway my opinion.  Business and Politics are made of an <br>
     amalgamation of types of people, not all self-serving/interest-serving <br>
     a**holes, and certainly not all trusted altruistic saints.  <br>
     <br>
     Interesting stats in the LA Times this weekend after the announcement <br>
     about the coffin nail industry deal ($368 billion).  Number of deaths <br>
     related to tobacco yearly, 400,000+.  Alcohol?  100,000+.  Sexually <br>
     transmitted diseases and motor vehicles were down in the 20s and 30s <br>
     (and who knows how much alcohol factors into those numbers).  The <br>
     chasm is profound between addiction-related substances and other <br>
     mundane human endeavors with the typical cursory amount of risk.<br>
     <br>
     As far as trusting Bill Gates, Hugh Hefner, Clinton, Newt, or Captain <br>
     Kangaroo, we each choose the story by the best spin doctor and decide <br>
     on our comfort level.  It could possibly be all smoke and mirrors for <br>
     the working class to keep us distracted and/or entertained. So what'll <br>
     it be, sh*t or chocolate-covered sh*t?<br>
     <br>
     Jaded but not hopeless in S.F. and the weather's decent.  Today life <br>
     is good.<br>
     <br>
