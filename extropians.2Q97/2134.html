Eivind Berge &lt;eivber@online.no&gt; writes of the term<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;neo-Luddites</i><br>
<i>&gt; ^^^</i><br>
<p>
to whit:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I am getting tired of seeing this pleonasm on this list. All dictionaries</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have checked list "any opponent of new technologies" as the second</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense of "Luddite"; the "neo-" is completely redundant.</i><br>
<p>
I love etymology.<br>
<p>
Luddites were the friends of Ned Ludd, right?<br>
So, after that, "neo-Luddites" *might* have been used to mean,<br>
"anybody who hates tech like the Luddites did," right?<br>
And then the "neo" got dropped because "Luddite" by itself meant<br>
was sufficient?<br>
<p>
Only I don't think that's how it went.  People didn't used to love adding<br>
"neo" to words.<br>
<p>
So it was more like, there were the original Luddites, then people<br>
stretched the term to mean tech-haters in general.<br>
<p>
And for generations that's what "Luddites" has meant.<br>
<p>
But recently, (say since 1990? 1985?)  there has been A NEW CROP.<br>
Or, a crop middle-aged writers have given anti-tech a new push.<br>
<p>
I forget these esteemed ones' names at the moment, but the term<br>
"Neo-Luddites" refers to this recent crop, not tech-haters in general.<br>
What they're doing that's considered fresh or new I'm not sure,<br>
maybe it's just having the audacity to write screeds against tech on<br>
Ms. Word 6 instead of the electric typewriters the previous generation<br>
used.<br>
<p>
Or maybe this coinage is older than I thought, but always having that<br>
implication of "oh no, *more* of them!?"  Dope springs eternal, especially<br>
around both sides of binary-choice "issues".<br>
<p>
As I understand it (*yawn* mmm, a nap would be *nice* right now),<br>
