Primarily things like winning the lottery or the Heisman trophy.  People<br>
today spend a lot of time and effort on things they have very slim chances of<br>
succeeding at.<br>
<p>

<p>
According to one major theory, yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also,</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution does take time; scientific reasoning is mostly new to the past</i><br>
<i>&gt;few centuries, and its large growth wouldn't be eating into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;'parasites' you mention yet.</i><br>
<p>
Indeed.  I was asking whether the papers took into account the co-evolution<br>
of these agents, which could potentially interfere with the development of<br>
the wise agents these analyses predict.  Robin's answer was basically no,<br>
they didn't take this into account.  <br>
<p>
I would tend to suspect the existence of such parasitic memes would<br>
accelerate this evolution of these characteristics.  However, the same memes<br>
might organize society against such agents, too.  Educated, thrifty, and<br>
practical minorities, such as Jews, overseas Chinese, or Parsees, are often<br>
persecuted by society at large.  Of course things are complicated in that two<br>
of the above minorities are carrying significant religious baggage of their<br>
own.<br>
