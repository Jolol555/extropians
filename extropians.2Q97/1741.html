The typical time-span, or window of opportunity, for such cultural<br>
modulations is the generation of perhaps 27 or 25 years (hence the 12.5 /25<br>
/50 year chunking in my developmental sketch).  This is akin to Fernand<br>
Braudel's famous conjonctures and Modelski's global phases.  A child of<br>
1890 is a member of the effectual generation 1915-40, and a `baby boomer'<br>
of 1945 will be crucially positioned for consequential collective action<br>
(or opposition) from about 1970 onward - although active opposition to<br>
racism or the Vietnam War, for example, brought this date forward for a<br>
large minority of boomers.<br>
<p>
Postulate, then, that each of my six discursive nodes corresponds to a<br>
period of 50 years.  Very roughly, the first of two coupled generations<br>
will see a Dominant rise, while the successor will see it at first<br>
consolidated, and then in decline.  This procession, if nothing intervenes<br>
to compress or stretch it out, would yield a historical cycle (for the West<br>
in the previous millennium, at least) some 300 years long.=20<br>
<p>
Consider a sequence of six `cultural dominants' in the West from, say, 1700<br>
through the zero year 1850 to 2000, then starting again (and for the 300<br>
years prior to 1700, at least).  They alternate in the manner of Modelskian<br>
double phases, thus:<br>
<p>
	1700-1724-1749: Phatic/aristocracy/local loyalties/poor schooling<br>
	1750-1774-1799: `We'/absolutism/Classicism (Augustan literature)<br>
	1800-1824-1849: `I'/anticlerical/Romanticism ([Michelangelo], Byron)<br>
	1850-1874-1899: `IT'/scientific empiricism/empire ([Shakespeare])<br>
	1900-1924-1949: Text/unstable absolutism ([30 Years War], WWs I&amp;II)<br>
	1950-1974-1999: Code/oligarchical representative democracies<br>
	{2000-2024-2049: Phatic/Postmodern and post-industrial fragmentation}<br>
<p>
This narrative is not to be taken as describing anything so lawful and<br>
regular as the gravitational orbits of planets about their sun.  It<br>
resembles more the apparent modulation of climate as the sun's energy<br>
output waxes and wanes through its 22-year-long sunspot cycle, or over<br>
millennia as the earth tilts and wobbles on its axis. =20<br>
<p>
The proposed clock, or cyclical calendar, notates the transition from one<br>
Dominant to another, and perhaps incorporates an alternation in styles of<br>
informational regimes from `top-down' to `bottom-up' and back again.<br>
Forerunners may unconsciously anticipate its urgings by a decade or more,<br>
while the collectivity tends to lag another decade behind the cultural<br>
standard-bearers.  This communal sluggishness might be dubbed `Zeitgeist<br>
inertia'.=20<br>
<p>
The birth-dates of a given dominant's first generation cluster within the<br>
second or consolidatory generation of its predecessor.  Thus its early<br>
exemplars will reach vigorous maturity at around age 25, their entrained<br>
children 25 years after that; they will be preparing for death in their<br>
mid-seventies (and perhaps disseminating their old-fashioned wisdom to<br>
whomever will listen) as the next dominant surges toward hegemony.<br>
<p>
Consider more precise cases.  On my suggested Jakobson schema, the children<br>
cyclically entrained to articulate and exhibit the most recent `I' or<br>
`ADDRESSER' dominant were born around 1774, and first acted decisively (as<br>
their peer Napoleon did) around the turn of the nineteenth century, the<br>
birth of Romanticism. =20<br>
<p>
The second generation of the `IT' or `WORLD' modality were young adults<br>
from around 1874, and children born at that time might be expected to<br>
cultivate a new modality centring on `TEXT' or `THEORY'.  Notable (male)<br>
births of that era were Albert Einstein (b.1879), Pablo Picasso (b.1881),<br>
James Joyce (b.1882), who came of age in the phase doomed to global war.=20<br>
<p>
Children born around 1924 were raised - if the model is correct - by<br>
parents steeped in that previous theoretical practice, and might be<br>
expected to re-shape the world according to the dominance of `CODE': James<br>
Watson of DNA double-helix fame was b.1928; Murray Gell-Mann, who uncovered<br>
the nuclear structure coded as quarks and leptons, was b.1929. =20<br>
<p>
Similarly, the first generation of culture-bearers governed by the `CODE'<br>
dominant was active between, roughly, 1949 and 1974 - the period of<br>
structuralism, the civil rights and anti-war revolts in the USA - and we<br>
are now drawing toward the close of its second generation.  Those children<br>
from around 1949, the `baby boomers', are predicted by the model as peaking<br>
in this second `CODE' generation: Chris Langton, inventor of `artificial<br>
life' literally coded in computer programs, was b.1948; Kathy Acker and<br>
Martin Amis, whose postmodern novels scarifyingly deploy semiotic<br>
transforms of their fin de si=E8cle urban landscapes, were b.1948 and 1949. =<br>
 =20<br>
<p>
Nor is it surprising that the stirrings of the next, or `PHATIC/<br>
ALGORITHMIC', dominant have been pervasive in avant-garde postmodern and<br>
infobahn textuality of every kind.  It is a prediction of this model that<br>
the channel-oriented, the algorithmic, the generic will command the first<br>
25 or 50 years of the new millennium.  Such emphases on rule, rote and<br>
formulae work both for good and ill, creatively expressed as computerised<br>
virtual realities and stultifyingly as media pap.  There will be resurgent<br>
local loyalties (something we are seeing already, often marked by blood),<br>
with routinised work or none at all.<br>
<p>
Is the theory strictly testable?  One can run the model backwards in an<br>
attempt to retrodict the science and arts of the last two great cycles, as<br>
well as forward.  It is intriguing that Immanuel Kant was b.1724, near the<br>
second peak of the most recent `PHATIC' or `ALGORITHMIC' dominant, and<br>
matured during the first peak of the `WE' or `ADDRESSEE' generation,<br>
suitably enough for the great philosopher of the categorical imperative.<br>
The first generation of the `I' or `ADDRESSER' generation peaked in 1800:<br>
they include William Wordsworth (b.1770), engineer Isambard Brunel<br>
(b.1769).  Mary Shelley (b.1797) represents the second generation<br>
emphasising the `ADDRESSER' node; Frankenstein epitomises both Gothic<br>
exultation and unease at Promethean subjectivity, and a dread of the<br>
forceful new empiricism (`IT' phase) beyond the next generational horizon. =<br>
=20<br>
<p>
Such `generations' are hardly so tidy, of course.  Darwin (b.1809) and Marx<br>
(b.1818) matured during the early Romantic phase of the `ADDRESSER' but<br>
were influential on the emerging first generation devoted to the `WORLD' or<br>
`IT' dominant. Physicist Lord Kelvin and brain surgeon Paul Broca,<br>
impeccable explorers of the empirical world, were both b.1824, on the<br>
rising trajectory into imperial vigour.  Composer Edward Elgar (b.1857)<br>
appeared at an appropriate time to be `programmed' as the pre-eminent<br>
British laureate of empirical empire's second or melancholy phase.  But no<br>
list of confirming instances can `prove' the utility or validity of such a<br>
schema, of course, as any Popperian will remind us, and evaluation is<br>
perhaps finally a matter of aesthetic choice.<br>
<p>
Stipulating for argument's sake that this schema is broadly valid, how<br>
would any given cultural Dominant impact on the `internalist' dynamics of<br>
various scientific and artistic practice?  These are themselves parsed by<br>
their different emphases on the six Jakobson nodes. =20<br>
<p>
One might speculate that something akin to harmonic reinforcement and<br>
extinction might apply: in a Code-driven cycle-phase like the second half<br>
of the twentieth century, versions of practice dependent upon coding and a<br>
co-ordinated community of practitioners will tend to attract attention,<br>
gain political support, feel `in tune' with the mood of the age.  Varieties<br>
less consistent with the pre-eminence of Code and Addressee - specifically,<br>
those accenting the romantic Addresser, and repudiating genre and algorithm<br>
while turning aside somewhat from the urgencies of the given world - will<br>
fail to flourish.  Presumably similar effects will be generated by<br>
reinforcement and interference with recurrent global political and economic<br>
power struggles mapped by Modelski's long cycles of a century's duration.<br>
<p>
What the cyclical Jakobson schema predicts for our own global culture is<br>
consistent with a balkanised western/post-soviet world early next century,<br>
followed by two generations of imposed `imperial' stability after a new and<br>
terrible global contest for leadership.  A restless upsurge of utopian New<br>
Romanticism might be expected in the early 22nd century. =20<br>
<p>
Of course, discontinuous advances in technology might change all this in a<br>
stroke, or by a series of utterly unpredictable ruptures.  Self-replicating<br>
nanotechnology, and human-level (or superhuman!) artificial intelligence,<br>
will have a profound influence on almost everything human culture has<br>
accepted as givens to this point.  Major advances in genetic engineering,<br>
including such singularities as optional abolition of death, might be even<br>
more unsettling.  At worst, global ecological collapse or uncontrolled<br>
warfare based on ethno-specific or age-specific designer viruses would<br>
interrupt the ticking of the most ancient and embedded clocks.  (I explore<br>
these disruptive possibilities in my forthcoming book The Spike:<br>
Accelerating into the Unimaginable Future.)<br>
<p>
Despite the much-vaunted re-discovery of `the body' by some poststructural<br>
thinkers, current Francophile theory is still reluctant to take seriously<br>
the fact that humans are animals evolved through millions of years at the<br>
edge of starvation.  It is not impossible that our proudest cultural<br>
efflorescences are fractal foam on the rushing and retreating edges of the<br>
combers of deep evolutionary tides, especially the genetic drives for<br>
sustenance and procreation inflected by local circumstances.<br>
<p>
For Walter Benjamin, in a lovely and glacial epigram, history was an angel<br>
flying backward into the future.  I propose (if less beautifully, less<br>
terribly) that culture - our engaged histories - is a squabbling group of<br>
humans making our way steadily forward in a riverrun ascent, a path with no<br>
single destination, a re-entrant spiral at once concealed and hauntingly<br>
familiar, known to us in the discursive and somatic memories of five or ten<br>
thousand generations of voyagers, sceptics, storytellers.<br>
