One quasi-mystical model I particularly dislike &amp; wanted to mention in<br>
my  earlier Extropians post about New Age myths of the mind (but<br>
didn't have the reference at hand) is the LILA model of Doug Seeley &amp;<br>
Michael Baker at the South Australia Institute of Technology (couldn't<br>
find anything on the Web), mentioned in the final section of Nick<br>
Herbert's _Elemental Mind_: <br>
<p>
&lt;In the LILA story, before time, space, and matter came into<br>
existence, One Mind is. The physical universe began with an<br>
unprecedented event called the 'blanket denial' in which 'parts' of<br>
the Timeless Mental Unity unaccountably refused to recognize their<br>
connection with other 'parts'. ... The inner history of the post-Big<br>
Bang universe, according to LILA is the story of certain entities<br>
'wising up', renouncing the illusion of separateness, and accepting<br>
their deep connection with certain other entities as fact. ... When<br>
all entities connect (in a terminal event the authors call 'the<br>
Restoration'), the physical universe simply vanishes like the mistake<br>
it was in the first place.&gt;<br>
<p>
This sounds no different to me from the Christian Apocalypse &amp;<br>
Resurrection. We're supposed to regress back into the womb, the void,<br>
from everything back to nothing, renouncing our worldly 'sins'! Isn't<br>
that wonderful? This is the death wish most whimpish religions aspire<br>
to rather than the rough and tumble, creative destruction of a truly<br>
pluralistic extropian universe. (It's also why I sometimes hanker for<br>
heroes and am eager to believe in boundaries for borganisms, and for<br>
creepy nanofog clouds of grey-goo clones out to consume the cosmos...)<br>
