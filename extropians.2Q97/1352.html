Myself and a few others have been looking at offshore company formation for<br>
a while now.  What type of company are you thinking of starting?  Lesser<br>
developed nations will often waive tariffs and give large tax breaks to<br>
high-tech companies that want to operate in their country.  I have stacks<br>
of papers from the State Department as well as a couple overseas<br>
governments regarding the issue of overseas company formation.  You don't<br>
realize how easy it is to start a company in the U.S. until you try and do<br>
it in another country.<br>
<p>
I am hoping to get an overseas venture going within a couple years.<br>
