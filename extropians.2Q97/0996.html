<i>&gt; Quite simple.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Media propaganda.</i><br>
<p>
WHose? The Cuban Government jams all US radio and television boradcasts,<br>
to the point of occasionally interfering in the southern Florida<br>
broadcast market area. Cubans get a banana version of the BBC: 3<br>
channels of government propaganda.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Financial support by US secret services -- many exile Cubans indeed</i><br>

<i>&gt; become poor.</i><br>
<p>
Hah, thats a funny one. We just finished a big operation to stop Cubans<br>
from coming into the country, to the point of holding them in a<br>
concentration camp at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station. Those people<br>
preferred living in a concentration camp to going back to Cuba.<br>
<p>
They are the least likely to become poor compared to who? Asian<br>
immigrants far outstrip all other immigrants in terms of educational<br>
attainment and per capita income. Cubans fare better than their Mexican<br>
ethnic cousins for one reason: Cuban refugees are fleeing a government<br>
that supresses their ability to succeed, while Mexicans are attracted to<br>
a welfare system that is much better than their own. Tell me, which type<br>
of immigrant is going to succeed more often?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not for economic isolation. Nor is communism (see COMECON). And Cuba</i><br>
<i>&gt; is practically isolated today. Yet it has a child mortality of a level</i><br>
<i>&gt; comparable to that of industrialized free market economies (8, if I</i><br>
<i>&gt; remember correctly, and the US got about 7).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
That is the publicized rate. Never trust the propaganda of communist<br>
governments.<br>
<p>
Nor is Cuba practically isolated today. This just goes to show how much<br>
you really know about current events. While the US, its largest and<br>
nearest neigbor has shut off trade, they have rebuilt trade with Mexico,<br>
most of South AMerica, as well as many European and African countries<br>
that don't need or want to kow tow to US gov't demands. Canada is a HUGE<br>
partner with Cuba, and is the biggest propagandizer of the campaign<br>
against Helms Burton, because Canadian companies are making major bank<br>
in the Cuban fire sales of seized properties. Canada is the big hypocrit<br>
here. People wonder why we dont pursue the same policies with regard to<br>
China, N. Korea, and Cuba. Its obvious that China and N Korea never<br>
seized anywhere near the same level of assets as the Cubans did.<br>
