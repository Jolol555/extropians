Well, the list seems to be working again now so I'll try sending this <br>
again...<br>

centrophenoxine or of DMAE?&gt;<br>

In case you're unable to do a Web search here are some summaries:<br>

&lt;DMAE  The memory stimulant ... Choline is the usual precursor of <br>
acetylcholine, but it does not cross the blood-brain barrier very <br>
well. The body makes acetylcholine from choline as it is needed. DMAE <br>
is basically a choline molecule with one methyl group missing from the <br>
nitrogen. DMAE is more able to cross the blood-brain barrier than <br>
choline. Once inside the brain, an enzyme performs a methylation that <br>
converts DMAE into choline. So, taking DMAE increases the brain's <br>
potential to make neurotransmitters.  Dean and Morgenthaler's book <br>
reports the following effects for DMAE: mood elevation, improvement of <br>
memory and learning, intelligence increases, and increases in the life <br>
span of laboratory animals.&gt;<br>

&lt;Lipofuscin is the material centrophenoxine is said to remove or scour <br>
from the glial cells or neurons. It is the waste or residue of <br>
digestion by lysosomes of effete organelles and bacteria.... The data <br>
demonstrate that centrophenoxine-induced inhibition of lipofuscin <br>
accumulation has a positive influence on the cell metabolism and the <br>
mitotic division capacity and causes a delay of the cellular aging of <br>
the human glia cells in vitro. (Rodemann and Bayreuther, 1979) <br>
Concomitant with the reduction of the accumulated lipofuscin, <br>
centrophenoxine- treated glia cells show enhanced rates of RNA <br>
synthesis, protein synthesis and glucose uptake. Most likely the <br>
utilization of glucose is shifted from glycolysis to the pentose <br>
phosphate pathway. Data suggest reduction of lipofuscin by <br>
centrophenoxine has a positive effect on cell metabolic functions and <br>
causes a delay of the cellular aging of the human glia cells in vitro. <br>
(1983)&gt;<br>
<p>
As for what Morris Johnson was referring to (BTW, I didn't see any <br>
reference by Max More to centrophenoxine) when saying<br>
&lt;I was astonished at the similarity between the combination of DMAE <br>
plus the common herbicide 2,4-D and centrophenoxine.  The only <br>
difference is the 2, chloro of the 2,4-D.  Would people exposed to <br>
minimal amounts of 2,4-d while also consuming DMAE have similar <br>
effects to those of centrophenoxine?&gt;<br>
I haven't a clue - interaction of neurochemicals in the brain is an <br>
EXTREMELY complex subject.<br>
