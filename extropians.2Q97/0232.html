<p>
Let's take some simple "smart drug", for example.  How hard would it <br>
be to find a dozen people, give them some simple cognitive skill <br>
tests, then give half the drug and half a placebo, give the tests <br>
again, and print all the numbers?  We could do it in a few hours at a <br>
party, and repeat the ones that showed promise to get better sample <br>
size.   The fact that numbers like these are never printed makes me <br>
suspicious of the whole supplement industry.&gt;<br>
<p>
There are several problems with this:<br>
<p>
First, most supplements (according to the claims) take time to produce <br>
an effect.  It's not like you can take a capsule and immediately see a <br>
result.<br>
<p>
I have found that most 'nootropics' appear to act more as 'mood <br>
enhancers' or stimulants rather than improving some simple and <br>
measurable cognitive skill. But, then, that's something that's <br>
subjectively observable and I'm some objective measurement like how <br>
fast I can read or how well I might score on some coordination test.<br>
<p>
How do you measure a 'rapture effect' without doing something <br>
impractical like measuring the level of endorphins in the brain? <br>
 There's also an issue of tolerances.  Some of these substances have a <br>
very apparent effect the first few times they are used, but then as <br>
the body (or mind) becomes used to them the effect is either <br>
attenuated or taken for granted and not as consciously noticeable.<br>
<p>
There are some ways to experiment on your own, maintaining a healthy <br>
level of skepticism until you see some noticeable effect that is new <br>
in your experience and 'appears' to be causally associated with the <br>
substance being used.<br>
<p>
For example, I tried ginkgo billoba (reputed to be a powerful <br>
antioxidant herb) never expecting to notice any effect from it - I <br>
just assumed that if it worked it might improve 'brain circulation', <br>
whatever that meant.  Usually I just took a capsule in the morning <br>
along with my other vitamins.  On occasion though, I would take one <br>
before bed time.  I was surprised to notice that my dreams, on these <br>
occasions, would be alot more 'narrative', that is, rather than a <br>
'typical' impressionist dream of people and places and feelings, it <br>
seemed like someone was reading a story to me.  Even when I noticed <br>
this and 'said to myself' (still asleep), that this story was <br>
ridiculous, the narrattion continued as if it were a TV program that I <br>
could not turn off.  This was something that I had rarely noticed <br>
before even though I make an attempt to remember my dreams every <br>
night.  As a 'control' I would then try to observe this effect on <br>
other nights with and without the ginkgo.  Also as a control, this was <br>
before I had read any details or annecdotes about ginkgo billoba other <br>
that it was supposed to be an antioxidant.<br>
<p>
Also, it's hard to distinguish the primary mental changes of a <br>
biochemical effect from the secondary changes produced by increased <br>
mental exercise or concentration.  For example, an athlete might take <br>
some sort of stimulant that inspires them to do more exercise but it <br>
is most likely the exercise itself that results in measurable <br>
increases in muscle mass or coordination.<br>
<p>
How would you measure the improvements in your life from zen <br>
meditations?<br>
