Has he come out? What about the recent mandatory key-surrender bill and<br>
the new one to ban 'bomb-making information' on the Net (which means that<br>
the Congressional Record would have to be withdrawn). Will he veto those<br>

now that the CDA's failure is clear.<br>

I still think you put too much faith in the Chinese government. The <br>
situation there seems to be going the opposite way to Russia; instead of <br>
a government collapse followed by a change-over to a more free-market <br>
system we're seeing a change-over to a more free-market system followed <br>
(probably) by a government collapse.<br>
