<i>&gt;I'd like to start a PICS bureau that labelled sites for "cluefulness",</i><br>
<i>&gt;so that users could filter out various levels of idiocy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
It seems we have a misunderstanding.  I know that the intent of PICS is <br>
to give the user freedom to filter whatever they want.  And that is not <br>
my concern.  My point is that I have heard that PICS can be used to <br>
censor OTHER people!  The idea for PICS came from the concern of parents <br>
as to what they want their children to view on the net.  Since PICS is <br>
intended to be built into the infrastructure, it could also be used by <br>
any third party (such as the chineese government), to censor other <br>
people from what they can and cannot see.  At least this is what I've <br>
heard - and thats why I made this post in the first place.<br>
