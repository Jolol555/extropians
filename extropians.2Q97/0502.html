<i>&gt; With all due respect ard, please do not quote the entire digest in one</i><br>

<p>
	With all due respect Michael, we quoted not a single word from the digest.<br>
 We did quote six words from Mr. and Mrs. Dylans little boy Bobbie.  <br>
	A little observation would have prevented this error....very little<br>
observation.<br>
So what was your point?   Do you want to explore this topic or just tell us<br>
what a great place you live in?  Most contributors to this list over-quotes<br>
and usually doesn't bother removing most of what was previously written.   <br>
We usually send pretty clean copy and usually pretty short.   So, what was<br>
your real point?   We don't need your answer as much as you do.<br>
	We did receive some good information privately  from some on this list. <br>
We understood that was the purpose of the list, sharing. 							ard<br>
