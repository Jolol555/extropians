The subjective life of borganisms is a fascinating field to speculate<br>
on. The "classic" view is of course that there is just one big<br>
consciousness, the Collective. But it might be possible that each<br>
unit is an individual, able to think for itself but still a part of<br>
the Collective. Note that these two possibilities form a continuum: <br>
on one hand fully independent individuals and on the other hand a<br>
single distributed mind, with mixtures in between. As the bandwidth<br>
between their minds increase, they become more and more a single unit<br>
(the Collective is simply the metaindividual which forms). There is<br>
no reason to think all units of a borganism needs to be identical,<br>
instead it might be useful to have many different kinds (both<br>
physically and mentally).<br>
<p>
It is not certain the optimal state is total unity, that might cause<br>
undue waste of bandwidth. If bandwidth is limited there is no point<br>
in broadcasting all mental activity, so keeping some of it internal<br>
is reasonable. The topology of the network is also important, since<br>
it might cause differentiation: a group of units somewhat isolated<br>
from the Collective would form a small borganism relatively loosely<br>
connected with the Collective, and if the units were stringed out we<br>
would get a "linear mind" (like the tine sentries in AFUTD).<br>
<p>
This might be a reason for the borgs standing in their niches as seen<br>
in Star Trek: when not on duty, they take advantage of the high<br>
bandwidth of the intranet of the borg ship to truly become one, while<br>
as mobile workers they are less integrated (this may post hoc explain<br>
their inefficiency).<br>
<p>
As I mentioned earlier, the typical borg emotionlessness and<br>
callousness can be explained by their form of thinking: a borganism<br>
can have intense emotions, but they are not displayed since it is<br>
unnecessary (why smile when everybody else in the Collective also is<br>
amused? ), and to a borganism individuals are just as uninteresting<br>
as single cells; although I could imagine a friendly borganism which<br>
for one reason or another took interest in their lives; however, to<br>
the borganism the easiest way of communication would be to assimilate<br>
a few individuals - that way it would also get a lot more information<br>
about the individuals - but there is little need to make the<br>
assimilation permanent. <br>
<p>
Note that even individual units of a borganism doesn't need to fear<br>
death; it would probably be a trivial matter to do regular backups of<br>
their minds (like the Culture warships do in Iain Bank's<br>
_Excession_), and if they are simply copies of each other there is no<br>
reason to worry about the end of individual existence.<br>
