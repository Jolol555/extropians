Actually, I doubt I can feel the difference from what you've done.  <br>
I think your data is biased, even ignoring the small sample size.  Of<br>
course, proper digestion of food always helps, I think you mean "proper"<br>
food combining.  The problem is that you knew that you were supposed to<br>
feel better following the more rigid diet.  This allows psychological<br>
effects to alter the results.  <br>
To get better results, the person being studied would have to be ignorant<br>
of whatever supposed benefits food combining gives.  In addition, it would<br>
be useful if the same foods were eaten but only the order was changed.  I<br>
find it likely that you ate different foods (or at least different<br>
quantities) in each diet.<br>
Of course, if you think it works for you, go for it.  I would just<br>
recommend that you be hesitant suggesting the diet to others.  Food combing<br>
may seem too complex to someone who might normally accept a vegan diet for<br>
health reasons.<br>
