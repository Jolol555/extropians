No I have not posted any reasons for this at all. What I thought might<br>
lead to a discussion sort of deteriorated into something else. Anyway,<br>
those of you who have read Asimov's Foundation Trilogy will probably see<br>
the parallel coming up.<br>
<p>
Does any regime desire revolution? <br>
<p>
IMO, no government wishes to see itself supplanted by another, for<br>
whatever reason. In this sense, a government is by nature<br>
self-interested. Oh, it seems to be quite altruistic, even benevolent at<br>
times, giving "free" lunches and whatnot. But of course, if you toss any<br>
dog a bone he shuts up for a while. Indeed, toss any pack of dogs a bone<br>
and they might not shut up, but at least they'll squabble amongst<br>
themselves (the CIA said, "Let's send crack to the ghetto. That'll keep<br>
their guns pointed at each other -- not us.) <br>
<p>
So given a self-interested government, what does that government do when<br>
discontent reaches a critical mass? To avoid revolution, that government<br>
must crack down (pun intended) on the mischief-makers.<br>
<p>
Let's see some current events from the point-of-view of the Fed:<br>
<p>
Wacko, TX: Alarming show of conviction (i.e., mass suicide). Americans<br>
may be beginning to believe in things other than God and the<br>
Constitution.<br>
<p>
Ruby Ridge: Mass brainwashing can explain Waco, but Randy Weaver was<br>
rational -- which his Congressional hearing appearance proved. A lone<br>
American can actually face off against the might of the Federal<br>
Government without being crazy? <br>
<p>
Unabomber: One man makes it his life work to kill people in order to,<br>
inter alia, send the government a message. But, hey, if at least one<br>
member of every person's family is a rat, we might still be safe.<br>
<p>
Militias: Rednecks with ideals. Uttering such blasphemous terms as<br>
liberty, civil rights, the Constitution, etc. Uh-oh. They've got a<br>
shitload of guns, to boot. <br>
 <br>
Oklahoma City: That does it. These militias are not just ex-vets with<br>
grand Soldier of Fortune delusions. These guys are meaning what they<br>
say, to the tune of hundreds dead from one big old bomb.<br>
<p>
Secessionists: Rational people who really don't want to live here<br>
anymore. (See <a href="http://www.wavefront.com/~homelands/">http://www.wavefront.com/~homelands/</a> ) <br>
<p>
It seems to me that a certain subversive element of the American<br>
psychology has come out of hiding. This country was birthed in the<br>
violence of revolution against tyranny, and revisionism has made us<br>
forget that tyranny is not necessarily relegated to history or modern<br>
third world countries. <br>
<p>
Don't bet the government hasn't noticed.<br>
<p>
IMO, it is not difficult to imagine that the machinery in Washington is<br>
slowly grinding out a strategy to deal with this "problem." These<br>
strategists are not the idiots we see on TV. I'll bet they're damn smart<br>
and idealistic as well. They believe in what they're doing, and like<br>
automata they do it relentlessly. Of course, their first target is the<br>
Internet, a bastion of subversive ideas. Sure PGP, SFS and other of the<br>
encryption programs are quite good. But notice the governmental reaction<br>
to their distribution. I'm sure most of us realize it is much less than<br>
positive.<br>
<p>
It is this reaction that I must sieze upon. Why would a government care<br>
that its own citizens, and maybe some others from elsewhere, are making<br>
it more difficult for prying eyes to get at their data? The answer is<br>
pretty clear, because some people might, just might have a legitimate<br>
reason for getting at that data. Of course, the government believes that<br>
its legitimate reason is law enforcement. <br>
<p>
There has not quite been a concerted assualt on privacy as of yet. Okay,<br>
certain anti-privacy initiatives have been put into place (I won't run<br>
through them all here -- go to <a href="http://www.epic.org">http://www.epic.org</a> <br>
for details -- but suffice it to say, there have been just as many<br>
setbacks for the government as gains. However, I rue the day my fears<br>
become reality when the first bulletin hits the wires about the new<br>
"wave of terrorism" that is imminent across the United States. This is<br>
all that is needed. I envision legislators arguing beautifully before a<br>
packed Congress that privacy must bow before the "safety" of our<br>
children. Who would dare risk political death by "killing children." The<br>
worst thing ever to happen to civil liberty was the invention of the<br>
"balancing test." As if one's right to freely associate may be curtailed<br>
due to "compelling governmental interest." The tools are all in place.<br>
One smart propagandist need only invent the compelling governmental<br>
interest and the house of cards can be picked apart one card at a time. <br>
<p>
See <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism">http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism</a> for starters.<br>
<p>
So, when the compelling governmental interest is actualized, and your<br>
tax dollars are finally diverted into thwarting your privacy, you will<br>
be not be able to do a thing -- especially when it becomes a felony for<br>
you to even try. <br>
