I just got a couple Fall 1969 copies of the Whole Earth Catalog.  I think<br>
the following statement by Stuart Brand was in there from the first edition:<br>
<p>
   PURPOSE<br>
<p>
   We *are* as gods and might as well get good at it.  So far, remotely done<br>
   power and glory--as via government, big business, formal education,<br>
   church--has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual<br>
   gains.  In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate,<br>
   personal power is developing--power of the individual to conduct his own<br>
   education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and<br>
   share his adventure with whoever is interested.  Tools that aid this<br>
   process are sought and promoted by the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG.<br>
<p>
The back cover has the word "FURTHER" in giant letters, streaking up and<br>
away from the little photo of the Earth, and underneath the Earth in tiny<br>
letters: "closer."<br>
