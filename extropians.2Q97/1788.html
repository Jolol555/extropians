On Sun, 15 Jun Anders Sandberg responds to my question:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Am I talking about about DNA computing? ... equivalent to</i><br>
Turing-computability.  It might not look like bits/bytes and machines, but it<br>
is the same thing....<br>
<p>
Anders, Yes, DNA computing sounds correct...  I'm a lay person on this<br>
subject so I don't know what Turing-computability is either...  I will<br>
research the Web page you referred to-- thanks.  What I'm really wondering is<br>
if there is a way for the Extropian user community to upload their ACTUAL<br>
brain DNA to a "DNA computer network" (or Chemical computer), where their<br>
brains would be networked through say actual DNA "axons" as to provide a<br>
"collective brain bank"-- where the whole is greater than the sum of the<br>
parts?<br>
<p>
And if so,  would such a system have the same theoretical advantages of<br>
"small scale and massive parallelism" and limitation by "diffusion speeds,<br>
the amount of mass you can handle (combinatorial explosions)", that you spoke<br>
of, or are AI and bit/byte based machines/neuronets a better solution for<br>
bringing into fruition the "Extropian Brain Uploading"  theory, that everyone<br>
has been discussing the past several days?<br>
