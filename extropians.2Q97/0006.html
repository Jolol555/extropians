In a message dated 97-04-01 16:29:43 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  It just does</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; it. There is no way I could scare my computer, there is no way I could</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; anger my computer, there is no way I could embarass my computer, there</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; is no way I can give my computer pleasure or pain, no matter what data I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; send it or in what fashion I handle it. How is this so difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; understand?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Only because you are only existing in the now. You automatically assume</i><br>
<i>&gt;  because your computer is not programmed to do these things now, that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will never be programmed to do these things. There is your error.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I do not see where he says this. Sounds like he is saying it isn't happening<br>
now, and he sees no evidence that you or anyone else has  found a way to make<br>
a computer have emotions. It is not a matter of saying it if is POSSIBLE, it<br>
is how is it to be implemented. And whether our own cognitive brain functions<br>
are understood well enough to speculate or build upon this knowledge.<br>
<p>
I am still waiting to hear how the installation of emotion into computers<br>
will occur.<br>
I see it 100% desirable if we are to have cognitively functional machines. <br>
