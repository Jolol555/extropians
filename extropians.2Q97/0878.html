<i>&gt; Making a Gamma ray burster in your back yard would not be a good idea, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; what would be a reasonable energy source for an super advanced civilization?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Solar power may be old fashioned but I still like it. I certainly would not</i><br>
<i>&gt; recommend building breeder reactors, there is already a glut of plutonium in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the world. All reactors produce plutonium, a big power plant reactor will</i><br>
<i>&gt; invariable produce many tons of it in its lifetime. A breeder reactor is</i><br>
<i>&gt; designed to maximize the production of plutonium. I'm not even a great fan of</i><br>
<i>&gt; conventional reactors, and call me a wimp if you want to, but breeders really</i><br>
<i>&gt; give me the creeps.</i><br>
<p>
A bit inaccurate. A breeder can be set to produce excess plutonium,<br>
produce no excess, or to burn up excess plutonium. This is why there<br>
have been proposals to restart the Hanford breeder as a means of helping<br>
Russia and Byellorus (sp?) dispose of their weapons grade plutonium.<br>
most people automatically get the creeps from the name Breeder because<br>
it brings up images of all those 50's nuclear monster movies.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) A breeder is at a much higher energy density than a regular reactor and</i><br>
<i>&gt;    that means it's inherently more dangerous.</i><br>
<p>
No it just means it produces more energy per pound of reactor than a<br>
light water reactor. If you use that as a measure of danger, since solar<br>
panels have a energy desity ten times higher than a breeder reactor, is<br>
solar power ten times more dangerous? I didn't think so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) A conventional reactor uses Uranium as fuel in which the U235 has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;    enriched from the naturally occurring .7% concentration to about 4%,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    you need about 85% to make a bomb.  A breeder uses weapons grade plutonium</i><br>
<i>&gt;    as a fuel, and lots of it. </i><br>
<p>
it uses plutonium at an enrichment level of about 40%, half that of<br>
weapons grade.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 3) A conventional reactor uses water as a coolant and to slow down the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    neutrons, a breeder uses molten sodium that burns in the air and explodes</i><br>
<i>&gt;    in the presents of water. After a short time in operation this hot liquid</i><br>
<i>&gt;    sodium becomes intensely radioactive. Just last year a leak in a sodium</i><br>
<i>&gt;    pump destroyed the newest and largest breeder reactor in Japan,  if it</i><br>
<i>&gt;    wasn't in a containment building it could have been a human disaster.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    It's already an economic disaster of several hundred million dollars.</i><br>
<p>
Thats why they make containment buildings. Funny though, people don't<br>
realize that the ash emitted by coal plants has highly radioactive<br>
isotopes in it, as well as the fly ash that coal plants sell to contrete<br>
plants to make concrete with. One coal plant puts out more radioactivity<br>
into the environment every year than all the nuclear plants in the<br>
country combined.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The thing I really don't like about fission reactors is that they produce all</i><br>
<i>&gt; that damn plutonium. There is so much of it in existence, thousands of tons,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it's very hard to keep track of it all. You only need slightly over</i><br>
<i>&gt; 9 pounds to make a crude nuclear bomb, less if you're clever.</i><br>
<p>
Getting the plutonium is one thing, but knowing how to build a bomb that<br>
will actually explode using only  9 pounds is another level of<br>
accomplishment entirely. BUilding a bomb of the simplicity of the<br>
Nagasaki weapon requires a minimum of 35 pounds of plutonium, as well as<br>
requiring the use of 48 Klystron switches, which are even more highly<br>
controlled items than plutonium itself.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is another type of Nuclear power, but there are 2 things I don't like</i><br>
<i>&gt; about fusion reactors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) They don't exist, yet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 2) Most reactions would make things near the reactor radioactive because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;    produce high speed neutrons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The fusion reaction I like best is between non radioactive deuterium</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Hydrogen 2) and non radioactive Helium 3, this produces non radioactive</i><br>
<i>&gt; Helium 4, an easily controlled proton, 18.3 mev of energy, and most important</i><br>
<i>&gt; of all, no neutron. Unfortunately you need a higher temperature to achieve it</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the deuterium tritium reaction most are talking about.</i><br>
<p>
True this is the most elegant solution, but getting a commercially<br>
viable supply of Helium III will require that we set up a mining colony<br>
on the moon, though I'm not sure but wouldn't a breeder reactor be ideal<br>
for making Helium III?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There is a type of cold fusion that definitely works, even as cold as 13</i><br>
<i>&gt; degrees Kelvin but, as Eugene mentioned recently, there hasn't been much</i><br>
<i>&gt; happening in muon-catalyzed cold fusion lately, and it's a shame because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea seems so elegant. A negative muon is almost identical to an electron</i><br>
<i>&gt; except it's 207 times as massive, you can even substitute them for electrons</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Hydrogen and the result is atoms and molecules 207 times smaller than</i><br>
<i>&gt; normal. In all fusion reactions you need to get the nucleus of 2 atoms so</i><br>
<i>&gt; close that the short range nuclear forces can take over, this is not easy to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do because the nucleus of both atoms have a positive charge and so repel each</i><br>
<i>&gt; other. In normal fusion you use brute force to do this, things get very hot</i><br>
<i>&gt; and so the two slam together, if you use muons instead of electrons in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hydrogen molecule the two nuclei are already 207 times closer together even</i><br>
<i>&gt; when ice cold.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are problems of course, it takes energy to make a muon, to break even</i><br>
<i>&gt; each muon would have to catalyze between 100 and 500 fusion reactions, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; muons are not stable, their half life is 2*10^-6 seconds, but a lot can happen</i><br>
<i>&gt; in two microseconds, that's a very long time by particle physics standards.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I know of no fundamental reason it couldn't be made to work.</i><br>
<p>
WHat is a cheap and easy way to make muons?<br>
