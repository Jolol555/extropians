First off I should say that Robin's point about humans holding onto the<br>
niche for generality for long enough, is interesting and I have nothing<br>
to say but hmm.<br>

Interesting scenario: a mass-produced personality.  Everyone would get<br>
to know it intimately (unlike the way everyone knows public personalities<br>
superficially).  They'd know its flaws, share tricks for dealing with it...<br>
and meanwhile each of the instances would have the same blind spots to<br>
the same faults.  In fact you could get a mass version of that two-person<br>
dynamic where character traits and conflicts get exaggerated.<br>
<p>
But you could also have copies that broke the mold in one way or another,<br>
which would provide an interesting kind of example of the potential of<br>
individuality and transcending limitations.<br>
