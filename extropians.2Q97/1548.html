I would bet we can do it, quite easily.  Easily, that is, if you have<br>
the energy to break apart every single molecular bond.  It's a fine idea<br>
if you have fusion torches or large solar mirrors already at hand;<br>
vaporize or melt asteroid material and fractionally separate it or<br>
something.  But if you can extract the water or plastics through other<br>
means this will take less energy than blasting your garbage and<br>
recombining the atoms.<br>
<p>
True, that energy would come back from recombination.  But that's at a<br>
later stage in the process, we can't store random energy at will without<br>
cost, and in reality blasting and recombination would probably lose lots<br>
of heat.<br>
<p>
Self-reliability check: I know we can make plasmas, which are<br>
dissociated, by heating anything enough, not to mention melts.  I don't<br>
know for sure that we could reliably sort out the elements.  If we can I<br>
doubt we can close the energy loop as you'd need.  Any engineers able to<br>
correct me?<br>
