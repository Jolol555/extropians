If you accept that God created us (in his own image, no less), and you <br>
accept that God is omniscient, then you must accept that God knew full <br>
well what he was doing when he created us with consciousness, curiosity, <br>
and the ability to develop technology to assist us in our growth.  <br>
Therefore, the philosophy of transhuman development not only _doesn't_ <br>
defy evolution, but is, rather, part of our evolution, and is also part <br>
of God's plan for us.<br>

Put that in your Bible and smoke it!<br>
