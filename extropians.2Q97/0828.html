NASA EXPLAINS HOW MOLECULAR-SIZED GEARS MIGHT WORK<br>
<p>
A technical paper sponsored by NASA and recently accepted by<br>
the journal "Nanotechnology" explains how molecular-sized gears<br>
might work.<br>
<p>
"Thanks to simulation of molecular-sized gears by a NASA<br>
supercomputer, hope is growing that products made of thousands of<br>
tiny machines that could self-repair or adapt to the environment<br>
can ultimately be constructed," said Al Globus, a co-author of the paper.<br>
<p>
Authors are Jie Han, Al Globus, Richard Jaffe and Glenn<br>
Deardorff of NASA's Ames Research Center, Mountain View, CA.<br>
<p>
Researchers have simulated attaching benzyne molecules to the<br>
outside of a nanotube to form gear teeth, explained Globus.<br>
Nanotubes are molecular-sized pipes made of carbon atoms.  "You<br>
also need a cooling system for gears.  We used a supercomputer to<br>
simulate successful cooling of molecular-sized gears with helium<br>
and neon gases," he explained.<br>
<p>
To "drive" the gears, the computer simulated a laser that<br>
served as a motor.  "The laser creates an electric field around<br>
the nanotube.  We put a positively charged atom on one side of the<br>
nanotube, and a negatively charged atom on the other side.  The<br>
electric field drags the nanotube around like a shaft turning," he said.<br>
<p>
"These gears would rotate best at about 100 billion turns per<br>
second or six trillion rotations per minute (rpm)," he added.  The<br>
gears that Globus and others have simulated with computers would<br>
be about a nanometer across.  A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter.<br>
<p>
One practical use of nanotechnology would be to build a<br>
"matter compiler," said Creon Levit, a Globus colleague at Ames.<br>
"We would give this machine, made of nano parts, some raw<br>
materials, like natural gas, for example.  A computer program<br>
would specify an arrangement of atoms, and the matter compiler<br>
would arrange the atoms from the raw materials to make a macro-<br>
scale machine or parts," Levit added.<br>
<p>
"A matter compiler is not just science fiction.  In the<br>
biotechnology industry, there are already 'peptide synthesizers'<br>
in use.  You give them a sequence of amino acids you want<br>
produced, and the machine will create those peptides.  But you<br>
can't make rockets out of peptides," he said.  A peptide is a<br>
sequence of amino acids.<br>
<p>
"A step along the way to make an aerospace matter compiler is<br>
an even smaller hypothetical machine, the 'assembler/replicator,'"<br>
said Globus.  "The replicator can make a copy of itself, just as a<br>
living cell can duplicate itself.<br>
<p>
"We would like to write computer programs that would enable<br>
assembler/replicators to make aerospace materials, parts and<br>
machines in atomic detail," he said.  "Such materials should have<br>
tremendous strength and thermal properties."  Further information<br>
on these materials can be obtained on the researchers' Internet<br>

An image of the nanogear from a computer simulation is<br>
available at the following URL:<br>

<p>
A long range goal, according to Globus, is to make materials<br>
that have radically superior strength-to-weight ratio.  Diamond,<br>
for example, has 69 times the strength-to-weight ratio of<br>
titanium.  A second goal is to make "active" or "smart" materials.<br>
<p>
"There is absolutely no question that active materials can be<br>
made," Globus explained.  "Look at your skin.  It repairs itself.<br>
It sweats to cool itself.  It stretches as it grows.  It's an<br>
active material," he said.<br>
<p>
Globus strongly emphasized that making real nanomachines may<br>
be decades away, but he said that computer simulations suggest the<br>
tiny machines are possible after engineers learn to build<br>
nanoparts and to assemble nanomachines.<br>
<p>
The nanogear and other related Ames research is a<br>
collaboration between the Ames Numerical Aerospace Simulation<br>
Systems Division and the Ames Computational Chemistry Branch.<br>
