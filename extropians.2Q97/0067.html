EXpedition 97 is just three months away.  This is probably a good time to<br>
remind folks that a group of us will be taking a backpacking trip in northern<br>
New Mexico from July 3 to 7, 1997.  Rendezvous is at the Albuquerque airport<br>
as early as possible on July 3 and we will be getting out of the back country<br>
in time for departing flights from Albuquerque during the afternoon of July<br>
7.  We will probably make the trip in a way that people could depart earlier<br>
than that, if necessary.<br>
<p>
Right now, the plan is to try to gather the party by no later than noon or 1<br>
pm on July 3 for departure by car from the Albuquerque airport.  We'll be<br>
picking up consumables that can't travel by air in Albuquerque (fuel and<br>
last-minute "I forgots") and then heading to our trailhead campsite in the<br>
Pecos Wilderness Area outside Santa Fe.  We'll hike into a base camp along<br>
the Pecos River on July 4.  Activity on the 5th and 6th will depend on<br>
whether group members need to leave earlier than the 7th, but will most<br>
probably either consist of day hikes up the Pecos and to other destinations<br>
or a very mild overnight peak-bagging expedition.  We'll break our base camp<br>
early on the 7th and make it out to the cars and back to Albuquerque that<br>
day.<br>
<p>
I'm an experienced backpacking guide and there will be others on the trip<br>
with backcountry experience.  This will be a very mild trip, so novices are<br>
welcome.  I've created a web page for the trip, with itinerary details, a<br>
list of folks who have expressed an interest in going, and tips for novices:<br>
<p>
       <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch2/exp97.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch2/exp97.html</a><br>
<p>
Everyone is invited to stop by the web page and everyone is invited to come<br>
along on what promises to be a great trip!  If you're interested, please drop<br>
me a line privately.  Please put the term "EXpedition 97" at the beginning of<br>
the subject line so I'll be sure to spot your message.<br>
<p>
I'm sending a separate e-mail to everyone I can identify who has already<br>
expressed an interest.  As some of you know, I've had some hardware problems<br>
in recent weeks that caused me to lose some e-mail archives so, if you get<br>
this message from the List and don't get a private e-mail, PLEASE send me a<br>
note to confirm your continuing interest.<br>
<p>
I look forward to seeing you on EXpedition 97!<br>
