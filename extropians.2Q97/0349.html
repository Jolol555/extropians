I recently pulled out some of my personal notebooks from years gone by.<br>
I am surprised to find my 'religious' views have changed little over the<br>
years.  The only caveat to this is that I am now (almost) certain God<br>
doesn't exist as I was brainwashed to believe 'He' did.<br>
<p>
I suddenly realise that throughout my life I have never equated religion<br>
with a concept of god(s).  Religion is a system of beliefs.  The concept<br>
of god is a power ploy for control over the believers.  I do not suppose<br>
we will ever know for sure but the 'god' concept is probably the origin<br>
of government.<br>
<p>
This idea brings up whether the concept of 'democracy' or 'communism' is<br>
a religion.  It seems ALL religions involving 'supreme beings' attempt<br>
to convert by intimidation (Believe THIS or you are WRONG!).  These<br>
practices always seem to slowly develop more and more control over the<br>
organization.  I'll pick on the christian religion for starters:<br>
<p>
Originally started as a splinter group breaking away from the prevailing<br>
power elite.<br>
Simple 'rules' (the Ten Commandments)<br>
Open to everyone<br>
Just 'believe' and you're in<br>
<p>
Then<br>
<p>
You can't do that and be a true believer!<br>
Ceremonies and rituals developed (to distinguish the true followers?)<br>
Power struggles, rewriting of it's history and bylaws.<br>
The church at Rome became the universal (catholic) voice of truth for<br>
ALL.<br>
Persecution of non-believers.<br>
<p>
Then it got worse.<br>
<p>
You HAD to be 'blessed' by the leaders to even be involved in<br>
non-religious activities (such as running your own slice of the world)<br>
You couldn't explore new areas of endeavor (spiritual or otherwise)<br>
unless in doing so you advanced the religion.<br>
You got killed for not believing, whether you were guilty or not<br>
(Inquisition)<br>
Turn emotions against logic, if you make it illegal to question, all the<br>
masses have left is emotion.<br>
<p>
Then...<br>
<p>
A splinter group broke away from the power elite, refuting many of the<br>
demands of the established organization.  Unfortunately, the above<br>
scenario happened all over again.<br>
<p>
Government has many parallels.<br>
<p>
Break away from the existing power with fewer laws and more freedom.<br>
Everyone has a voice.<br>
Powerstruggle ensues.<br>
Vote for an accepted 'believer' who will then 'have your voice'.<br>
You can't do THAT and be a good citizen!<br>
Persecution of those who speak out against the state.<br>
Appealing to emotion.<br>
Ad infinitum.<br>
<p>
"A rose by any name would smell as sweet."<br>
"Religion is the opiate of the masses."<br>
"When the state does something 'for your own good', be frightened."<br>
<p>
My questions are:  Will we ever be rid of 'religion'?  Should even try?<br>
Is the cycle unbreakable?<br>
<p>
