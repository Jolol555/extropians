<i>&gt;  icon and retain a small cult following. In a little while Max gets bored </i><br>
<i>&gt;  and decides to leave earth for a large party at a distant location.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (There a happy ending for Max without saddling him with all that easy</i><br>

<p>
On the way Max is hit by some space debry, he loses all powers of rational<br>
thought and joins a band of New Age Uploaded Luddites who refuse to accept<br>
any technology that wasn't made before the year 2076.  Because of this he is<br>
not subject to the slightly-smaller-than-last-time technology revolution and<br>
is eaten by hungry a pack of hungry AI's.<br>
