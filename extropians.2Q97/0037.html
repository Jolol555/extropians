In a message dated 97-04-02 15:56:44 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; There were a couple of what I term knee-jerk objectivist responses</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (which I was not entirely shocked to see), and a couple of platitudes</i><br>
<i>&gt;  like "selfishness isn't measured in dollars".</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
Hmmm, I saw deeper into the posts I read. Seemed like some people agreed that<br>
everyone can do "better" at something, and some people thought that they were<br>
doing pretty well in most of the areas "anonymous" picked on. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I would suggest that many people here would be better off consciously</i><br>
<i>&gt;  applying Popperian pan-critical rationalism to their own lives rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;  than treating wake up calls like the one "Anonymous" posted as foreign</i><br>
<i>&gt;  concepts to be rejected by the ego's immune system without</i><br>
<i>&gt;  consideration.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
I thought it was obvious that 'anonymous' had an axe to grind regarding<br>
certain individuals, and also found it odd that she/he thought we needed to<br>
veganize.  If you find merit in critiques of such a broad sweeping nature,<br>
 than great! I find fingerpointing useless.<br>
Prefer not to preach. Too busy doing life! <br>
Liked Robins post re: assumptions. Here's to each person finding their own<br>
measure....<br>
