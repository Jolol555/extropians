:-) I actually saw that I have failed almost directly just as I pressed <br>
the 'send' command. Just goes to show how good memory I have...<br>

<p>
Several ideas were quite interesting, such as the descriptions of the <br>
paper computers, tuple processing (quite natural in a nanotech world) and <br>
CryptNet. <br>

<p>
I think it is a hard balance for a creative author to avoid getting lost <br>
in all the interesting ideas and still provide a rich world. After all, <br>
every single thing in the world is a potential story in itself. I think <br>
Greg Egan's _Distress_ is a fine example of a story that doesn't get too <br>
lost in its complex world; not all threads need to get neatly (or <br>
worse, hurriedly) tied up.<br>
