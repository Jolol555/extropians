Brain-to-body is a good way of estimating intelligence; but it probably isn't<br>
the whole story.  I'd think that if dolphins were smarter than us they'd<br>
evade fishing nets better.  I could be wrong.  It could well be that dolphins<br>
are (and Neanderthals were) smarter than us but we do better because we're<br>
better platforms for memetic replication.<br>
<p>
To quibble, I said human were the smartest *primate* and dolphins aren't a<br>
counterexample to that.  However, I believe Neanderthals also had a higher<br>
brain-to-body than we do.<br>
