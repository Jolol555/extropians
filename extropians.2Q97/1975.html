Please don't post HMTL to the list; it's annoying, wastes bandwidth and<br>
very hard to read. It's particularly annoying when you also quote the<br>
entire post you're replying to for no obvious reason. <br>
<p>
To get back to what I think is your point from what I can decipher of the<br>
HTML: <br>
<p>
I was probably wrong about economics; Friedman argues for a system of<br>
fines as Perry was discussing earlier, since execution only loses you<br>
money whereas fines recover the costs. <br>
<p>
There's a big difference between combat and capital punishment, at least<br>
in an anarchist society. In combat you probably don't really want to be<br>
there and you're shooting at someone else who'd much rather be at home<br>
watching TV. In an anarcho-capitalist society if you voluntarily sign up<br>
with a legal system which allows capital punishment and then commit a<br>
capital crime, you have little to complain about when they kill you. Of<br>
course if a crime is committed on such a person by someone from another<br>
legal system the arbitrator might decide to allow a death penalty, but<br>
that's only likely to happen in extreme cases. Unlike the current monopoly<br>
law an anarchistic arbitrator requires a reputation for fairness and<br>
honesty in order to operate. <br>
<p>
While claiming that all killing is bad is very noble, at some stage you<br>
have to accept that some people are so badly programmed that you have the<br>
choice of either destroying their personality or destroying their body as<br>
well (personally I don't see a great deal of difference between the two).<br>
To give a topical example; what else can you do with someone like Pol Pot,<br>
who's clearly demonstrated their desire and ability to kill millions of <br>
people?<br>
