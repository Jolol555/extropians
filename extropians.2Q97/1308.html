In a message dated 23/05/97  12:57:33, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; 	Many Mystics believe that the human race is evolving, rather rapidly<br>
 lately, towards what Extros call transhuman.  They also embrace all that<br>
 man does as being "natural" as we come from and are part of nature. &gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I only discovered Extropy about a year ago.  The reason I consider myself<br>
'Extro' is because my personal beliefs (which I developed early in life) are<br>
very Extro.  The one thing about Extro and transhuman belief I have noticed,<br>
is that it's naturally accouring, it does not have to be forced.  I would<br>
even say, from my personal experience, that it is the 'natural' state.  Most<br>
Extro and transhumanist beliefs revolve around survival and evolution.  The<br>
two most natural things we do.<br>
<p>
I have heard many people say that our evolution should be away from 'animal<br>
behaviour', that we should rise above our natural instincts.  But evolution<br>
itself is a natural instinct, and what is life extention if not survival<br>
(very animalistic)!  <br>
<p>
These Mystics you talk of sound more Extro than a lot of self-confessed<br>
Extro's.  Hey, maybe I can call my self a Mystic now :)<br>
