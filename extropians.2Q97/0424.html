<i>&gt;So the big difference comes from sexuality, mortality, or both?</i><br>
<p>
The diff is sexuality, which makes each child only half you, so you<br>
have only half the interest in promoting its welfare over your own.<br>
Evolution has no problems with your dying in order to make room for<br>
another entity with your essential (i.e., selected-for)<br>
characteristics.<br>

<p>
The optimal risk aversion implies a certain risk premium.  If the<br>
market risk premium is less than this, you buy risky stuff.  Otherwise<br>
you don't.  What you should buy depends on the price, and your<br>
estimate of the actual risk.<br>

<p>
If these regions could effectively contract with each other, then both<br>
should grow at the same rate in terms of wealth.  Central memetic<br>
investments would compete with edge physical investments, and if there<br>
were more good ones of the later type, then edges would be funded by<br>
central investors, with payoffs flowing from the outside in.<br>
<p>
If these regions were cut off from one another, then the evolutionary<br>
arguments would apply to each one seperately.  The arguments I cited<br>
did not depend on the actual local growth rate available, so they<br>
imply that both places would have careful Bayesians.  And evolution<br>
should also select for agents which choose to be on the inside or<br>
outside based on expected growth rates in each place.  In a population<br>
dominated by such creatures, it wouldn't be obvious whether to head on<br>
out against great odds and competition, or to be one of the few who<br>
stay home.<br>
