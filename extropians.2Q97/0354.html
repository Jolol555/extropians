Well, the goal is cramming movies (while still recognizable as such) in<br>
smallest store possible. (Hint: compression ratio rules). Quality? What<br>
for? Besides, IFS/ANN compression should beat MPEG (or wavelets, or...) by<br>
orders over orders. Asymmetrical, of course. Crunching offline, <br>
expanding online. <br>

  <br>
Personally, I think the "Amiga(tm)" is cursed. So don't buy it, ever.<br>
(Particularly, if approached in the street. Hey mo, Amiga Inc., just $50. <br>
Deal?).<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why not? Sounds like a good price to me; just delete NT and install Linux </i><br>

<p>
Linux/AXP sucks still (as does any nonIneptlian Linux, according to last <br>
tests). And gcc takes eternities to run on the Alpha, and produces pure-d <br>
bagbiter code. You care for Alpha assembler? (It's sure smooth and mellow, <br>
but it's assembler still).<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Bad, bad, bad. I don't want my browser downloading pages which I didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; choose to look at, because I don't want to end up in access logs unless I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to. I get more than enough junk mail as it is. And just think of the</i><br>
<p>
Junk mail poses a sufficient problem on its own, it will be dealt with <br>
by a mechanism, shortly. Authentication by crypto protocol, I guess. Nothing <br>
less will serve. No more regurgitated spam, no, thanks. (Boy, I am <br>
looking forward to these times).<br>

<i>&gt; problems if someone links from a popular page to a legal Dutch porn site</i><br>

<i>&gt; American crypto ftp site. People looking at those pages would be breaking</i><br>
<p>
Well, I tend to just ignore insane legislation. What, a law preventing me<br>
from clicking on that link? Bull. I can click whatever thing I like. And<br>
the day they outlaw PGP will be the day I'll have my key certified. I<br>
won't even bother with steganography. Waaay too sublime. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; the law purely by accident as their browsers go off and download the </i><br>
<i>&gt; illegal data for them. </i><br>
<p>
Fuck the law, then. Let that be problem of the Chinese (those behind the <br>
Great China Firewall), or Arab countries.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; from skies seems a better choice, though. Speaking of that,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; when (compressed) video-bandwidth cellular links?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; From what I was reading last week British Rail have been testing video by </i><br>
<i>&gt; GSM. AFAIR it uses four GSM channels and only gives two or three frames </i><br>
<i>&gt; per second, but that's good enough for the security cameras they want to </i><br>
<p>
I was thinking of something way beyond GSM. Smaller cells, shorter<br>
wavelengths, higher bandwidth. Let's say, 10 MBit/s celllink. SF?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; install on trains. Presumably if you could afford to use 40 GSM channels </i><br>
<i>&gt; at once you could send 25fps.</i><br>
<p>
Ludicrous. Just 40 channels, eh?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Digital photography has taken wing, silver stock will definitely not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be a good future investment.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do color films use silver? Anyway, we have a long way to go before film</i><br>
<p>
Yes. I guess Ag (current price trend extrapolated) might find a niche in<br>
AC motor windings, though. Kinda better than copper (slightly). Ah, and <br>
silverware cutlery. It's traditional.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; becomes obsolete; my $700 35mm camera gives about five times the linear</i><br>
<i>&gt; resolution (twenty-five times as many 'pixels') of any similar priced</i><br>
<i>&gt; digital camera. So digital is great for snapshots and advertising photos</i><br>
<p>
Just now, yes. But a) not everybody is a pro b) CCD resolution will go up <br>
in near future c) image processing and archival is a lot easier if no <br>
scan necessary<br>
<p>
Personally, I don't care for high quality. I'd like the stuff I pictured<br>
to be recognizable, and dbaseable. Being able to send the pic over<br>
celllink is quite valuable for certain clientele. Silver hog photography<br>
will still have its niche in the high-end, for a long time, sure. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; with a short turnaround time (e.g. real estate agents, used car ads), but</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the moment it's lousy for real photography. </i><br>
<p>
I think the question is whether digital photography is suitable for the mass <br>
market. What's "real"? Picturing babies, animals, landscapes, and cars. I <br>
guess it qualifies, already. (Lookit! That's Marge on ole TV!).<br>
