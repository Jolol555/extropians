"Astronauts on  way to Mars in microwave plasma oven; expected to be done <br>
on arrival".<br>

Aargh. Will this never stop? Men to LEO, men to the moon, men to Mars. <br>
Trained monkeys in space. Instead of focusing on sustainability, like <br>
developing autoreplicating industry designed to work in space, we <br>
continue to be fatally attracted by pointless bottoms of the gravity wells.<br>
Don't they see that it is prohibitively expensive to drag up resources <br>
from below all the time? If indeed we should have monkeys in space, then <br>
they should send out machines to build an appropriate vivarium, first.<br>
<p>
Whatever happened to solar sails? Of course solar sails are pretty useless<br>
in the outskirts of the solar system, but what, please, have we lost there<br>
yet? Before we have fusion, Kuiper and Oort are out of question. It will<br>
be hard enough to use solar radiation in the asteroid belt -- the best<br>
investment would see to deccelerate the material into lower orbit by solar<br>
sails, into the high-luminance areas. But the best bootstrap investment<br>
would see to tap near-Earth resources, first. Heck, we've got even<br>
multiton ice debris out there. Water, silicates, tar, metal ore, hard<br>
vacuum, lots of sun and microgravitation conditions next door -- what else <br>
do we need? <br>
<p>
Oh yes, plasma drives. I remember seeing several plasma powered probes as<br>
kid in a russian space exhibition. Back then the idea was taking something<br>
easily ionizable, like cesium, ionize it, accelerate the ions, then<br>
ejecting the electrons back to create neutral plasma (orelse the probe<br>
acquires charge until it ceases to function). Monkeys ridiing a 10 MW <br>
nuclear reactor to Mars.... I dunno.<br>
