	i am currently of the opinion -- and please play devils advocate <br>
	here, if any of you has any ideas -- that new ideas more often<br>
	than not ARE scary and frightening to the established order.<br>
	evolution seems to take place among the young.  transhumanist<br>
	ideas are nothing more than a radical (not violent, but swift and<br>
	sure) shift of the human way of life.  max, if you were to offer<br>
	your ideas to the populace in a way that is truthful to your<br>
	philosophy you are going to frighten and confuse middle america,<br>
	whether you like it or not.<br>
<p>
	i'm afraid that if you have something truly revolutionary to say,<br>
	something as exciting and vibrant and transforming as<br>
	TRANSHUMANISM, you WILL create enemies, you will scare people,<br>
	you will get people accusing you of satan worship, forming a cult,<br>
	or whatever else is fashionable in Tabloid TV.  You will either<br>
	have to shut up, stop publicizing your ideas, or soften your<br>
	ideas if you want to avoid this.<br>
<p>
	NOTA BENE:  I can understand and appreciate your concern, i am<br>
	not saying that you should move forward with caution, you are <br>
	definitely being responsible and rational in looking into ways<br>
	to soften the impact of your ideas (especially in light of the<br>
	"C" word) -- i just wanted to bring some more thoughts into the<br>
	discussion.<br>
