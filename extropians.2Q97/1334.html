Ya!!<br>

<i>&gt; So it impossible to get gamma rays out of an object as small as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;burster in times as fast as a burster.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How to solve this problem?  Well, if whathever makes the burst is moving</i><br>
<i>&gt;towards us at close to the speed of light, it will be running just behind</i><br>
<i>&gt;the light that we see it with, so we will see things on it happening faster</i><br>
<i>&gt;than they actually occur.  It turns out that it is possible to get the</i><br>
<i>&gt;energy release of a burster if the source is moving toward us at 0.9995 c or</i><br>
<i>&gt;faster.  Moreover, it turns out that pretty much anything moving at that</i><br>
<i>&gt;speed through the interstellar medium will make a gamma ray burst when it</i><br>
<i>&gt;plows into interstellar hydrogen atoms.  The plowing process takes many</i><br>
<i>&gt;hours before the projectile slows down, but we see it compressed into a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;seconds because the projectile is traveling only a smidgen behind the gamma</i><br>
<i>&gt;rays it produces.  So *something* is throwing around chunks of stuff at</i><br>
<i>&gt;unheard-of speeds, by mechanisms unknown.  </i><br>
<p>
Yeah, like a big relativistic bomb phalanx.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Well, nobody understands these things.  At least now that we know they come</i><br>
<i>&gt;from cosmic distances, we can throw out *half* of the theories that people</i><br>
<i>&gt;have come up with.</i><br>
<p>
Binary neutron stars also exist in the Milky Way, perhaps as many as two<br>
hundred pairs at any given time (after the initial star formation).<br>
 Three such systems are tentatively identified.<br>
<p>
  A few years, there were 100 theories and less than 100<br>
<i>&gt;known bursts.  Now there are 1000 bursts and only about two dozen theories.</i><br>
<p>
Is the 'low profile' scenario considered one of them?<br>
