Eastern Europe reform leaves children behind<br>
<p>
Monday, 21 April 1997: Social reform in Central<br>
and Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of<br>
Independent States and the Baltic States has been<br>
piecemeal and uncertain in its aims, strategies<br>
and funding, says a UNICEF report issued today,<br>
which adds that economic reform planners have<br>
overlooked the welfare needs of millions of<br>
vulnerable children.<br>
<p>
Launching the report entitled Children at risk in<br>
Central and Eastern Europe: Perils and promises,<br>
in Bonn today, John Donohue, Director of the<br>
UNICEF Regional Office for Central and Eastern<br>
Europe, Commonwealth of Independent States and<br>
Baltic States, points in particular to the fate of<br>
the one million children in public care, trapped<br>
in the gulf between economic progress and social<br>
impoverishment.<br>
<p>
"At the beginning of the transition to market<br>
economies," Mr. Donohue said, "hopes ran high that<br>
the sub-human conditions prevailing in some<br>
children's homes would soon disappear. But<br>
numerous difficulties have stood in the way of<br>
major improvements in institutional care or a<br>
shift to more humane options for children without<br>
parental care. Even more worrying, there has been<br>
little change in attitudes and too many children<br>
are still being abandoned to state care. In some<br>
countries, like Moldova, Georgia and Armenia, the<br>
public child protection system has virtually<br>
collapsed. In most of the countries in transition<br>
-- not only in Romania, which has received most<br>
publicity -- the rates of children in public care<br>
have increased."<br>
<p>
This increase, beyond being a serious problem in<br>
its own right, is also an indicator of the higher<br>
risks many children have been facing during the<br>
transition years. Many families have had to cope<br>
with a devastating deterioration in their material<br>
conditions. Skills, social values and coping<br>
strategies developed in earlier decades have<br>
proved vastly inadequate. Poverty and social<br>
dislocation have put enormous burdens on families<br>
who often have limited capacity or experience in<br>
taking responsibility for their children's<br>
welfare, traditionally the task of state<br>
authorities. Since child monitoring and checking<br>
mechanisms, including those normally to be<br>
expected in school and health systems, have been<br>
eroded and are in need of reform, children are<br>
suffering.<br>
<p>
The answer, the report says, lies in political<br>
will to put the needs of children high on the<br>
reform agenda. New and humane social welfare<br>
networks would benefit all children in Central and<br>
Eastern Europe. Fears that only the poor,<br>
marginalised and excluded would be helped are<br>
misplaced.<br>
<p>
The publication, covering 18 countries in the<br>
region, is the fourth in a series of monitoring<br>
reports that have grown in coverage and impact.<br>
Since the first report was released in November<br>
1993 covering nine countries of the region, the<br>
scope of the research has expanded to take in 18<br>
countries: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,<br>
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia,<br>
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Slovakia,<br>
Slovenia, Poland, Romania, Russia and the Ukraine.<br>
The reports are prepared by the UNICEF-funded<br>
International Child Development Centre in<br>
Florence, Italy, and are intended as a "tool to<br>
alert public opinion and public authorities to the<br>
problems of children and other vulnerable groups<br>
in transitional economies, and to forge<br>
international cooperation to improve the situation<br>
for children in these countries."<br>
<p>
The latest report chronicles the substantial<br>
income drops families have experienced, rampant<br>
unemployment and family benefit losses in many<br>
Central and Eastern European states and, in<br>
countries of the former Soviet Union,<br>
sky-rocketing wage inequality. It analyses the<br>
welfare impact of increasing trends in<br>
single-parent households, falling birth rates and<br>
growing divorce rates. Additionally, it documents<br>
children's exposure to conflict and displacement<br>
in the region, and the hardships that result.<br>
<p>
Poor nutrition, alcoholism, smoking, stress in the<br>
workplace and at home, increasing violence and<br>
premature death are also taking their toll. In the<br>
former Soviet Union especially, there has been an<br>
unprecedented increase in the deaths of<br>
working-age men. Across the region as a whole,<br>
hundreds of thousands of children have experienced<br>
the premature death of parents (mostly fathers but<br>
also mothers) in their prime child-rearing ages.<br>
The most obvious risk children face from these<br>
traumas is orphanhood. The report estimates the<br>
increase in the number of children and teenagers<br>
who have lost a parent over 1990-1995 at about<br>
700,000, three-quarters of them in Russia.<br>
<p>
However, the underlying potential risks are<br>
multi-dimensional and go well beyond the numbers<br>
of premature parental deaths. The pressures of the<br>
transition appear to be splitting families apart<br>
and eroding parental responsibility. In addition<br>
to higher divorce rates, fewer divorced fathers<br>
provide regular support to their family now; the<br>
number of criminal cases for non-payment of<br>
alimony, for example, is rising in several<br>
countries.<br>
<p>
Health and education risks have also increased.<br>
Today parents can no longer count on universal<br>
public health and education systems nor on the<br>
same levels of efficiency in these systems to<br>
screen and check for risks their children are<br>
facing. Parents are having to take greater<br>
responsibility for the development of their<br>
children at a time when they are less able to do<br>
so and when child health and education needs are<br>
rising.<br>
<p>
Former full enrolment in primary schools has<br>
ceased to exist and the growing use of fees means<br>
that it is children form poorer households who<br>
face problems of access to pre-primary education,<br>
extracurricular activities and remedial help. In<br>
Russia, for example, some 5 per cent of primary<br>
school students -- about 100,000 in each grade --<br>
appear to be out of school. In Romania, secondary<br>
school enrolment rates were down 14 per cent in<br>
1995.<br>
<p>
Deprived of society-level protection mechanisms,<br>
children and adolescents in particular are falling<br>
prey to drug abuse, alcohol and tobacco addiction,<br>
violence, child prostitution, sexually transmitted<br>
diseases including HIV/AIDS, and crime. A rapid<br>
assessment survey of drug abuse in the Czech<br>
Republic completed in 1996 found that drug abuse<br>
is no longer only a problem of homeless and street<br>
children, but is gradually becoming "normal" in<br>
secondary schools. Among students surveyed, 14 per<br>
cent were regular drug users and 37 per cent<br>
reported having tried drugs at least once. Teenage<br>
suicide is also on the increase in many countries<br>
of the region, including all Central European<br>
countries (except Hungary), the Baltic and many<br>
countries of the CIS.<br>
<p>
Finally there are also indications of increasing<br>
child morbidity rates. The transition has seen a<br>
marked growth in the incidence of infectious<br>
diseases such as diphtheria and tuberculosis,<br>
particularly in countries of the CIS. The<br>
reappearance of these "diseases of poverty" is<br>
especially troubling, as they had been nearly<br>
eradicated.<br>
<p>
"In short," Mr. Donohue warns, summing up the<br>
conclusions of the report, "it may prove much more<br>
difficult to address adequately the risk<br>
situations than was anticipated at the close of<br>
the 1980s.<br>
<p>
"Traditional family support systems offering cash<br>
benefits and in-kind services in many cases do not<br>
reach the needy or provide appropriate help. There<br>
is an acute need in the whole region to encourage<br>
and bolster the development of a full new<br>
infrastructure of family support, focusing on<br>
providing a flexible range of community-based<br>
social services for parents and children in need.<br>
These could be provided by local and national<br>
governments as well as, with public encouragement,<br>
the voluntary and private sector. Health,<br>
education and social welfare agencies need to work<br>
together to provide such services. All the<br>
governments of this region have signed the<br>
Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is time<br>
to turn the promises of the Convention into<br>
reality and put the needs of children first."<br>
