I had much the same thought that Annette would probably get a more <br>
comprehensive and broad-based spectrum of opinion by posting a set of <br>
questions to the main Extropians list, but nonetheless I have volunteered <br>
to try to answer Annette's questions in person if necessary (or <br>
preferably, to arrange a meeting for her with myself and some of the <br>
other DC Extropians).  I did suggest that email would be easiest for me, <br>
so if that's amenable to her I may forward her questions to the list.<br>
