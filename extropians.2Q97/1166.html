I did not contribute to the origianl discussion, but have this bit to add.<br>
Many people like to appeal to "God's Will" as reason to oppose cloning.<br>
You could note in your article that even if there is a god, it is no<br>
longer in control.  Humans are reinventing themselves on their own terms,<br>
and we don't need permission. <br>
People who can not reason in human terms are ill equiped to deal with<br>
challenges such as cloning, and the breakthroughs that will follow.<br>
