<p>
I agree that many people are often risk-averse. However this is still a<br>
function of imperfect information. Why does one choose not to invest in<br>
a new software firm? Because he doesn't know that the firm will<br>
eventually be Microsoft. In the same way, a person who decides not to<br>
risk a drive to the beach because it may rain, only wishes he knew more<br>
about weather systems when it turns out to be a beautiful day. IMO,<br>
people are inherently self-aggrandizing (as I have offered before on<br>
this list), and if they *KNOW* they will be increased by a certain<br>
change in situation, skill, or whatever, they *WILL* accept the change,<br>
and quite often, pursue it for themselves.<br>
<p>

<p>
I don't know if this is true, but if it is, that means that the people<br>
on this list probably have, or firmly believe they have, more<br>
information than the rest of humanity.  <br>
