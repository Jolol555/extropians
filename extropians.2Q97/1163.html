I have done my very best to answer every single question my 3 1/2 year old<br>
daughter asks.  This is surprisingly difficult, espescially since she enjoys<br>
questioning every answer with a "why?".  It runs something like this:<br>
<p>
"Papa, what's this?"<br>
"It's an ice cream maker."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Because it was built to make ice cream."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Because people want ice cream makers, so other people build them."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Money.  People who want ice-cream makers will pay money to other people to<br>
build them."<br>
"Oh.  Let's make ice cream!"<br>
"Not now, sweetie."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"It's almost dinnertime, and I don't want you to spoil your appetite."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Because if you ate sweet ice cream before dinner, you wouldn't eat the<br>
non-sweet dinner food, and you wouldn't grow up big and strong."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Because we grow better when we eat things that aren't sweet."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Evolution.  Cave people didn't eat sweets."<br>
"Oh.  I want dinner now, so we can make ice cream right away soon!"<br>
"Okay.  Let's wash hands first."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"We always wash hands before dinner.  It's a rule."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Because if there's dirt or poo-poo on your hands, and it gets in your food,<br>
you might get sick."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Because there are tiny animals in dirt that sometimes grow inside people<br>
and make them sick."<br>
"Eeuw-yuck-pooie. Why?"<br>
"Evolution."<br>
"Oh."<br>
<p>
I find that these why-chains always end up at one of the following ultimate<br>
answers:<br>
<p>
"Money."<br>
"Evolution."<br>
"It's a law of physics."<br>
"Chance."<br>
"Nobody knows."<br>
"I don't know, but &lt;insert name&gt; does."<br>
<p>
Rachel doesn't really know how money, evolution, or physics work, but she's<br>
used to the notion that they are the underlying causes of things, so later<br>
when she learns about them, she'll have the right attitude.<br>
<p>
I suppose what makes me an Extropian child-rearer is that I never use any of<br>
these old standbys:<br>
<p>
"God made it that way."<br>
"Because I say so."<br>
"It just is."<br>
"You wouldn't understand."<br>
"Good little girls don't ask so many questions."<br>
<p>
I am willing to go over her head, if I have to, rather than leave a question<br>
unanswered.  But I've always found stuff that was over my head very<br>
educational, so why should I deny that to her?  It's amazing how she retains<br>
stuff that must seem like random gibberish to her, only to connect it later<br>
to something else.<br>
<p>

PS.  The why-chains last between three and six steps before grounding out in<br>
one of the root causes.  Does this tell us something about ontology,<br>
something about epistemology, or nothing important?<br>
