In a message dated 5/10/97 2:09:48 PM, mich_ros@alcor.concordia.ca (MikeRose)<br>
quotes Viktoras Kulvinkas, M.S as writing:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Protein requires acid digestive juices, while starch and sweet food</i><br>
<i>&gt;requirte alkaline. You cannot digest both at the same time. Dairy products</i><br>
<i>&gt;are highly alkaline, so they interfere with meat digestion. Fat interferes</i><br>
<i>&gt;with protein digestion.</i><br>
<p>
Here is that acid/base nonsense again.  I've already posted how this is flat<br>
wrong and betrays a basic lack of understanding of biology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"Vegetables take longer to digest than fruit; combining them in a single</i><br>
<i>&gt;meal can cause fermentation."</i><br>
<p>
Oh, here's another one.  No matter what you do, unless you're on serious<br>
antibiotics or lots of Beano, if you eat fiber, when it hits your colon, it<br>
*will* ferment.  <br>
<p>
Technically, this statement is correct. Vegetables have fiber, so combining<br>
them with fruit will cause fermentation.  What he doesn't say is that *not*<br>
combining them causes fermentation too!  Wonder if Kulvinkas knows that.<br>
<p>
(Mike writes as himself)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is the only book on nutrition that I possess, can anyone recomend any</i><br>
<i>&gt;other/better sources?</i><br>
<p>
Ooh, throw that one away.<br>
<p>
Walford's books are good, although geared to calorie restriction.  Pritikin<br>
is reasonable as well, if stringent.  Most of the "heart-healthy" (AMA style)<br>
diet books are OK.  Laurel's Kitchen Cookbook is a pleasant read and has good<br>
(vegetarian) recipes and common sense.<br>
