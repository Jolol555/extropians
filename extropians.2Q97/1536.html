<i>&gt; I remember having my idea of putting video with audio on laser disks called</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  stupid by my roommate in 1975.  A few years later my idea for moving this </i><br>
<i>&gt;  video/audio fantasy to a cable TV channel was stupid.  The early-80's I</i><br>
had <br>
<i>&gt;  this 'stupid' idea of yet another cable channel...this one catering to my </i><br>
<i>&gt;  science-fiction addiction.  The late 80's found my stupidity </i><br>
<i>&gt;  overwhelming....ideas of using computers to enhance movies (fantasy about </i><br>
<i>&gt;  having Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade character disgusted with Columbo over </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Marilyn Monroe as the murderess).  My friends and relatives thought all my</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  ideas unworthy but someone else had friends and family who didn't, and</i><br>
they <br>
<i>&gt;  are now in far better financial means.</i><br>
<p>
I also have this problem.  I come up with a great idea, everyone thinks it's<br>
'stupid'.  Then other people come along and make it into a product, I claim<br>
to have "had that idea years ago" and they all say "well why aren't you<br>
rich?".  Good question.<br>
