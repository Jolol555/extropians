&lt;There seem to be some controversy about antioxidants since the<br>
negative results reported in NEJM last year, and some positive results<br>
published later. At present it is uncertain if (say) vitamin C or E<br>
does some good or not (beside their obvious uses), but it is clear<br>
that eating a lot of fruits and vegetables promotes a longer and<br>
healthier life, possible due to antioxidants or other substances.&gt;<br>

The following URL <br>
<a href="http://pio06.urel.berkeley.edu/documentation/Packer.html">http://pio06.urel.berkeley.edu/documentation/Packer.html</a><br>
provides information on the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid and it’s<br>
role in the body’s anitoxidant recycling process:<br>
<p>
&lt;What [Lester] Packer has fleshed out in recent years is how<br>
alpha-lipoic acid and other antioxidants interact in a complex<br>
recycling process in the body. He showed several years ago, for<br>
example, that vitamin E "recycles" vitamin C in the body; that is,<br>
after vitamin E has disarmed or oxidized a free radical, vitamin C can<br>
come along and return vitamin E to fighting form. The two vitamins<br>
thus work together to prevent free radical damage in the body, Packer<br>
says. Since then he and his colleagues have shown that, in turn,<br>
vitamin C can be recycled by glutathione, an antioxidant produced only<br>
in the body. The cycle continues with another antioxidant, NADPH -- a<br>
coenzyme, or chemical essential to the action of other enzymes --<br>
recycling glutathione. <br>
<p>
Despite this detailed understanding of the antioxidant cycle, when<br>
Packer and other researchers tried to boost antioxidant levels to<br>
determine whether they can protect against disease, they were unable<br>
to find a way to increase glutathione levels. Glutathione cannot be<br>
taken by mouth like vitamins C and E because it is broken down in the<br>
stomach before it reaches the bloodstream. Alpha-lipoic acid proved to<br>
be the missing link, Packer says. Not only does it act as an<br>
antioxidant itself, it also stimulates production of glutathione,<br>
giving cells a double dose of antioxidant. It also is easily absorbed<br>
when taken orally, and once inside cells is quickly converted to its<br>
most potent form, dihydrolipoic acid.<br>
<p>
Because both alpha-lipoic acid and dihydrolipoic acid are<br>
antioxidants, their combined actions give them greater antioxidant<br>
potency than any natural antioxidant now known, Packer says. He notes<br>
another property of alpha-lipoic acid that makes it a great<br>
antioxidant. Since it is soluble in both water and fat, it can move<br>
into all parts of the cell to neutralize free radicals. Vitamin C, on<br>
the other hand, is limited to the watery parts of cells because it is<br>
soluble only in water; while vitamin E is soluble only in fat and<br>
sticks to the fatty parts of cells.<br>
<p>
Packer says alpha-lipoic acid also is important in cell metabolism, or<br>
the production of energy inside the cell. Without alpha-lipoic acid,<br>
cells cannot utilize sugar to produce energy and they shut down. This<br>
makes alpha-lipoic acid a metabolic antioxidant, able to draw on the<br>
cell's own metabolism to magnify its protective effects and that of<br>
other antioxidants.&gt;<br>
