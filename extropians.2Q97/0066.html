  It appears that at this point nobody has a decent representation<br>
of the taste space.  Purchase data and bestseller lists are generic<br>
and do not tell you what books are bought by different kinds of<br>
people; also, they reflect current trends, but not the books that<br>
people could have read 10 or 20 years ago. Reading lists are usually<br>
specialized.  Also, tastes and purchases are quite different things.<br>
<p>
(Besides, nobody has a database representing extropian tastes -<br>
which is one of the reasons I asked for advice on this list).<br>
<p>
It would be very interesting to do some real-time analysis of<br>
taste trends - this would allow, among all other things, to predict<br>
sales data for various products, and the market value of the<br>
companies that produce them...<br>
