A quibble, but hopefully a useful one to remember:  It probably isn't<br>
exactly "idle" to speculate that strife and conflict will persist in the<br>
aftermath of "the" singularity.  Gerald Feinberg's Promethian chestnut,<br>
namely that "[e]verything will be accomplished that does not violate known<br>
fundamental laws of science, as well as many things that do violate those<br>
laws," has to be false, strictly speaking, to the extent that there are<br>
indefinitely many outcomes that are at once logically possible but<br>
mutually exclusive.  Any development toward a technological elimination of<br>
the distinction between the "real" and the "discretionary" will be<br>
asymptotic at best because the obstacles to instrumental success are not<br>
exclusively problems of engineering, but are (ever more conspicuously with<br>
the maturation of the sciences and the expansion of the instrumental power<br>
of our knowledge-claims) problems of reconciling the competing visions,<br>
demands, expectations, and enterprises of posthuman peers.  Nevertheless,<br>
btw, I still adore Feinberg's declaration.  Best, Dale <br>
PS: FWIW, I think capital punishment quite as stomach-churningly icky a<br>
practice as are the atrocities in retribution for which we set it motion<br>
in the first place, and it seems a terrible idea to feel complacent or,<br>
gods forfend, morally righteous about a State apparatus of all things that<br>
takes up the task of extermination with any kind of regularity.  Surely?<br>
