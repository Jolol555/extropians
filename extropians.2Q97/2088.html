<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Personal incorporation creates a second legal entity, and is<br>
distinguishable from your person.<br>
<p>
Corporations legally protect its agents (i.e. employees) from most forms of<br>
civil prosecution and some cases of criminal prosecution.  However, certain<br>
individuals with executive powers do not enjoy the same level of exemption.<br>
 Executive officers can be held criminally responsible for the behavior of<br>
the corporation in certain instances.  In the case of a one person<br>
corporation, this would more or less always be the case.  Legally this<br>
would do little to protect your assets.  Also, unless you have *a lot* of<br>
money, capital gains taxes for the corporation are probably higher than<br>
your personal taxes on the same assets (although a subchapter S corp would<br>
fix that aspect).<br>
<p>
For example, in a criminal case against your personal corporation, the<br>
individual as sole executive officer and employee would be directly liable<br>
in virtually all cases, just as though you were an individual.  The rules<br>
regarding this vary little from state to state.  Personal incorporation<br>
produces no net benefit in terms of protecting your assets in a civil<br>
trial.  Your 100% stock ownership is a personal asset that can be taken<br>
away from the individual, and all corporate assets (i.e. 100% of your stock<br>
value) can be taken away from the corporation.  <br>
<p>
There is a possible viable alternative.  This is an idea that I have that<br>
might work, although a little complex.  The details in a couple parts are<br>
sketchy.<br>
<p>
The above scenarios are based on Corporate laws found in the U.S.  Since<br>
corporations are internationally recognized entities, an alternative would<br>
be to incorporate in a foreign tax shelter.  Anguilla is a well-known<br>
example.  <br>
<p>
You set up a corporation in Anguilla ( no corporate income tax ) of which<br>
you are the sole shareholder.  You then become an employee of your own<br>
foreign corporation living in the U.S.  This will require filing foreign<br>
franchise paperwork in the state you live in and usually involves paying a<br>
fee in most states ($800 in California).  You give yourself a minimal<br>
paycheck and have the corporation own your car, house, etc.  The<br>
corporation pays for the taxes that are still incurred on assets.  You are<br>
now *personally* responsible only for paying income taxes on your measly<br>
paycheck.  The corporation is then responsible only for property taxes and<br>
various employment taxes.  A large chunk of your earnings is retained by<br>
the corporation, which is never taxed at a corporate level.  Corporations<br>
generally only pay income taxes in their locale of incorporation.  Because<br>
you are a 100% shareholder, you still own your assets, but they are never<br>
taxable.  The value of your company's stock is subject to long-term capital<br>
gains taxes, so you would never have to pay capital appreciation if you<br>
never sell it.  As long as you aren't stupid about it(***see below), you<br>
could spend the corporation's money any way you like.<br>
<p>
The limitation is that your job would be limited to working under the<br>
auspices of your dummy foreign corporation.  For contractors, like many<br>
software developers, this should not be much of a problem.  Many<br>
contractors incorporate themselves locally.<br>
<p>
This is just an idea, and not fully researched, but may be workable.<br>
<p>
<p>
*** The IRS has something called a lifestyle audit, although rarely<br>
initiated, it allows them to arbitrarily set your taxable income based on<br>
their estimation of the cost of your lifestyle.  These are usually<br>
initiated against individuals who live flagrantly wealthy lifestyles yet<br>
claim a very modest taxable income.  It was originally designed to be used<br>
against drug dealers and organized crime figures, but has been used<br>
recently in more general cases.  However, initiation of this type of audit<br>
does require "probable cause".  In the words of a CPA and tax consultant,<br>
if a lifestyle audit is initiated against you, "you're f**ked, pure and<br>
simple".<br>
