I think that a major problem with the emotional and very much the<br>
sensual side of programs is lost by the way that computer programming is<br>
set up.  It is set up into organized structures,  they don't always have<br>
to be elegant.  And Anders I agree with you that it has been lost to<br>
scientists and computer scientists the more emotional and sensuous<br>
aspects of life.  Times are changing and more Artistic people are<br>
getting on the computers and learning to programs.<br>
<p>
Things are becoming more free form.  I can't wait to see what will<br>
happen with the new merger of science and artistic creativity that has<br>
begun on the computers!<br>
