<i>&gt; I doubt it needs to be said, but the results of a few studies is not very</i><br>
<i>&gt; convincing. </i><br>
<p>
 <br>
	We have no intention of "convincing" anyone.  We have run across<br>
information which coincides with our own experience. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Who conducted the study? </i><br>
<p>
	These studies were reported in a book by a doctor ( a real scientist<br>
type). <br>
 <br>
 Are these few studies just the ones that show some benefit for prayer<br>
while ignoring the ones that show no effect?<br>
<p>
	The doctor did not appear to be biased to the degree that he would stoop<br>
to such deception.<br>
	<br>
  Were the people praying for the sick person friends of this person? <br>
<p>
	They did not even know the person they were praying for.   Also the<br>
persons being prayed for did not know they were being prayed for.  It was a<br>
double-blind study.  Even the doctors did not know which patients were<br>
being prayed for.<br>
 <br>
<p>
If the study has any validity, I suspect it most probably shows the value<br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; friendship and knowing that there are people who care about you, even if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you don't know that they are praying.</i><br>
<p>
	Your suspicions are unfounded, however well intended.<br>
