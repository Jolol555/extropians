Having just flamed Erik Moeller, I should be fair and chew out bad<br>
supporting arguments.<br>

It takes a fair bit of chutzpah to call all of history ludicrous.  And<br>
most people accept the right to tell their children what to do, at<br>
least, and usually the right of a majority, especially when they feel<br>
they are part of the majority.  The real bottom line is which society<br>
makes people who can do something about being unhappy happier.<br>
Anarchist theory looks very nice but is rather short on solid evidence.<br>
Freer societies, good; no government, never been tried.  Why not?<br>

War --&gt; organized military activity.  If gov't is needed, anarchy can't<br>
defend itself.  If gov't isn't, organizations in an anarchy can wage<br>
war.  Unless effective defense can be broken up and individualized --<br>
like runaway space colonies, a la the Culture.  But that doesn't look<br>
like Earth.<br>
<p>
And this list may not be the place for such debates, but once you have<br>
picked up this debate, baldly asserting that "politicians are scum" will<br>
convince no one of anything.  Showing how politicians have hurt people<br>
more than they have helped might do something.  Name-calling won't.<br>

<p>
"They are very regulated"?  By their private owners, perhaps.  You know,<br>
the same institutions of private property extropians claim to support?<br>
Or do you think the owners and reporters of the LA Times are chafing to<br>
cover Extropy, but hindered by FBI agents?  Hah.  Most of them (owners<br>
and reporters) haven't heard of us, and probably think we're kooky if<br>
they have.  Especially if they'd ever seen a statement like yours.<br>
