The key to electrolysis is, as many with a passing familiarity with the<br>
English language may deduce, electricity.  Sure, you could split the water<br>
molecule with an on board battery and then combust the hydrogen, but that<br>
would be like running a sail boat with a fan when you could just as easily<br>
get a boat with an engine.  Use the electricity directly.  It would be<br>
considerably more efficient that way.<br>
Also, an incredibly efficient power source would not ruin the economy.  If<br>
the oil companies owned it, they could simply sell it for an enormous price<br>
and invest the proceeds in some business that would turn a profit.  If<br>
someone else owned it, the ICE would go the way of the horse and buggy. <br>
That did not ruin the economy.<br>
<p>
Apologies to all those who have actually taken chemistry and know something<br>
about price theory.<br>

<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; Remember, you need to make that hydrogen at power</i><br>
<i>&gt;  plants &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; actually, the author states the electrolysis can be done in the car, and</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt; reason it's not in use is because the federal government told him that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would ruin the economy.  Also, the media wont air the info because of</i><br>
fear,<br>
<i>&gt; which is also why i believe many people wont go for it, even though its</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible (he gave instructions for it).</i><br>
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>
Why not post them?  They have to be at least as entertaining as<br>
fundamentalist dogma.<br>
