The art of the impossible, if a true art, is merely waiting for the<br>
right artist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is it possible for any individual or small group to influence a large</i><br>

<p>
No.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The answer is yes. You cannot expect change to occur overnight in most</i><br>
<i>&gt; instances, however. The object in a political organization is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; influence prevailing opinion by presenting logical, viable alternatives</i><br>
<i>&gt; to existing policy and ideology.</i><br>
<p>
An entrenched incumbent is buttressed by thousands of dollars of donated<br>
money, money that has his next four (or six) years locked up. This means<br>
that *ANY* ideology represented in government by the tyranny of a<br>
majority (democratic or, at the very worst, despotic) will be conserved<br>
(i.e., will "die hard"). I mean to say that given a system of patronage<br>
and privilege (the control of monetary resources), the pace of change<br>
will be too slow to even call it "change." Whether logical or viable,<br>
new ideas (especially those that are, dare I say, "revolutionary") are<br>
the bane of those people in power. The only way to effect meaningful<br>
change in an established hierarchical system is to usurp the chain of<br>
command, and grab the reins yourself. <br>
<p>
EXTROPIANS OF THE WORLD UNITE!       <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Frequently, this is an evolutionary activity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's not that easy to change the minds of the people whose primary</i><br>
<i>&gt; activity is political involvement as an outlet of their daily</i><br>
<i>&gt; frustrations.</i><br>
<p>
That is, with genuine respect, profound.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We are not dealing with great intellectuals or academiticians, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather with people who are simply trying to survive in a world they did</i><br>
<i>&gt; not make.</i><br>
<p>
The brilliance of these people lies not in their product (what<br>
product?), but in their initial choice to "be in control." Power is the<br>
ultimate end of all human societal interaction. I see us here every day<br>
debating how mankind may finally have power over his fate. The notion of<br>
extropy is a power-hungry invention. Dammit, we *CAN* be what we want to<br>
be! This is arrogance, this is claiming power, and this I love.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Most people are willing to accept change if they understand how it will</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit them.</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely and entirely, 110% correct! Information has always been the<br>
key to human societal evolution. But, unfortunately, the more<br>
information one has, the more work one must do to sift out the crap.<br>
(Just do a search with the keyword "government" someday.) I think that<br>
paranoia is a more likely outcome than paradise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If all of society re enlightened through continuous education and</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge accumulates, change occurs that much faster.</i><br>
<p>
Education by whose standards and into what ideology? What kind of<br>
knowledge will eventually accumulate? And will it all be crap? IMO, fast<br>
change is revolution. And in the end, there's always someone who winds<br>
up holding the reins. I hope it's you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe we can consider the move to Mars next year.</i><br>
<p>
We will consider it. Whether it happens, depends on where the money<br>
goes.<br>
