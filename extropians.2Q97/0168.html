<i>&gt;  I reckon there's a lot of room for a modern, scientific, rational form of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mysticism that gets the experiences without the hypno-hype and extra</i><br>
<i>&gt;  cosmological baggage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Dennett's work makes a great foundation for this, IMHO.  Seeing the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  self as a 'virtual captain of the crew' is almost half way there!</i><br>

Oops! sorry to give you the wrong impression.The exact opposite of what I<br>
meant, mysticism.<br>
I was talking about a form of thinking that explans "spiritualism" in human's<br>
mind. A sustained low focus type, often mistaken for mysticism, exploited by<br>
religions of the world, but nothing mysterious, just under-researched. <br>
I suggested it was a part of our natural cognitive state.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  (Why bother?  Believe me, there is *nothing* like that experience; even</i><br>
<i>&gt;  psychedelics give merely a weedy little echo of the 'cosmicness' of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  And I think that sentient beings who *lived* from that perspective could</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be immensely powerful and joyful creatures.  Easily able to re-program</i><br>
<i>&gt;  themselves, to morph, etc. - in fact, Transhuman!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
Drug experiences may have some effect on this process by shutting down high<br>
focus thought ( sometimes permanently ; - ), but your so called 'mystics'<br>
have found meditation does it also. Also exercise seems to help and mindless<br>
simple things like shaving... driving....<br>
This process helps with creativity also. <br>
