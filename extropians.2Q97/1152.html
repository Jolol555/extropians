A quite Extropian take on cloning appears in the most recent issue of Wired,<br>
from the pen of none other than Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Nathan<br>
Myhrvold.  See Nathan Myhrvold, In Vitro Veritas, Wired at 109-10 (June<br>
1997). <br>
<p>
The powerful and at points quite innovative argument proceeds thusly:<br>
<p>
1) Many people object to cloning--but why?<br>
<p>
2) We already reproduce with technology, and nearly clone via it.<br>
<p>
3) Cloning already happens via happenstance.<br>
<p>
4) "Fear of clones is just another form of racism."  [Interesting point, eh?]<br>
<p>
5) "The most upsetting possibility in human cloning isn't superwarriors or<br>
dictators.  It's that rich people with big egos will clone themselves. . . .<br>
So what?  Rich and egoistic folks do all sorts of annoying things . . . ."<br>
 [Ha, ha!]<br>
<p>
6) "The 'deep ethical issues' about cloning mainly boil down to jealousy."<br>
 [In fact, they boil down to *envy*--a related but distinctly different<br>
emotion, and one that NM in fact means to cite.]<br>
<p>
7) Science good; ignorance bad.  [The actual language nicely mixes poetry and<br>
irony.]<br>
<p>
NM's Idee Forte ought to appear online eventually, if it has not already, at<br>
www.wired.com.  The magazine notes that a fuller version of the piece appears<br>
at www.slate.com/CriticalMass/97-03-13/CriticalMass.asp.<br>
