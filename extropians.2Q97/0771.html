        A week or so ago I was having a discussion with my physics teacher<br>
about  creating geological capacitors for storing lightning as a cheap power<br>
source.  A trivial and fun conversation, but near its end he started talking<br>
about how some revisionist  tech-hostorians believe that ancient monoliths<br>
like the pyramids and ancient mexican monuments were in essence the<br>
capacitors we were talking about.  A few simple tricks of electricity would<br>
give a great deal of power to the theocracy that ordered the building of<br>
these monuments. For example if an egyptian priest were able to fry a<br>
heritic to a cinder using the restrained power of ligntning or even simply<br>
make lightning dance from his fingers or his hair stand up on end while in a<br>
religious trance then this might create a certain deification of priests<br>
even though they could be killed easily by common men and mobs.  <br>
        However, when writing a paper recently I was struck by a quirk of<br>
the practice of cryonics, that the ancients may have already tried it.<br>
Ancients were placed in waiting chambers (tombs as we like to call them)<br>
after having their bodily fluids drained and then stored.  Kind of like full<br>
body cryo-preservation with out the cryo bit, which is a little hard to come<br>
up with in the middle of the desert.  But they did know that the hot dry air<br>
helped prevent decay so they built their preservation centers inthe desert<br>
and filled them with all the prized objects and even preserved the loved<br>
ones along side the important officals (it wans't just for pharohs) as if<br>
they might someday be revived and have a need for gold and companionship<br>
when their medical sciences, they had them to be sure could help the expired<br>
pharoh or general or administrator.<br>
                <br>
                                Another fun trivial fun line of though like<br>
the pyramid-capacitors but it is interesting and I am wondering what<br>
everybody thinks on the subject.<br>
