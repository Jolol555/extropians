<i>&gt; Quite simple.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Media propaganda.</i><br>
<p>
In Cuba? [Peals of laughter are heard].<br>
<p>
Yeah, there is plenty of government propaganda in Cuba. Very little of<br>
it that I am aware of claims the U.S. is a better place to live.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Financial support by US secret services -- many exile Cubans indeed</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a better life in the US today. Cubans are among the least likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; become poor.</i><br>
<p>
So, you are claiming that most Cuban exiles are being paid by the CIA?<br>
All of the millions of them? [Peals of laughter].<br>
<p>
Lets see. To support just one million Cubans, one needs only, lets be<br>
conservative and say we'll only give each $10,000 a year in secret<br>
checks. (Never mind how hard it would be to try to hide that a million<br>
people were getting secret checks, and never mind that you need more<br>
money than that to live well in the U.S.) That is about ten BILLION a<br>
year -- a lot more than the entire CIA budget.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yet it has a child mortality of a level comparable to that of</i><br>
<i>&gt; industrialized free market economies (8, if I remember correctly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the US got about 7).</i><br>
<p>
Get real.<br>
<p>
Cuba is so badly off today that animals and in some cases people are<br>
being used to plow the fields. (One article I read derisively noted<br>
that the Cubans don't even have proper yokes for their oxen.) Half of<br>
the young women in the country are out trying to prostitute themselves<br>
to tourists to try to make enough money to survive. (That isn't a joke<br>
-- I'm being literal.)  People living in a country where food<br>
practically grows on trees have trouble getting enough to eat<br>
well. One of the few things relieving the crushing poverty is the<br>
constant inflow of dollars from tourists and overseas Cubans. Doctors<br>
fight for the chance to become bellhops at tourist hotels, because it<br>
pays so much better.<br>
<p>
Maybe you can fool yourself, but its very hard to fool us.<br>
