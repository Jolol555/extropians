<i>&gt;&lt;&lt; Wouldn't it be more extropian to not limit your interviews to those </i><br>
<i>&gt; who happen to be physically nearby?  We do not wish to constrain </i><br>
<i>&gt; ourselves to our current biological manifestations, so why require </i><br>
<i>&gt; their presence? &gt;&gt; </i><br>
<p>
It might still be a little more comforting for this person to see<br>
someone in person.  I think that someone should try to see her if at all<br>
possible.<br>
But she should also get on the internet and we could all give her some<br>
help.<br>
<p>
I think both avenues should be persued!<br>
