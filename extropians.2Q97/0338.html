Necessary, because none of us can continue to stay alive without help.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Transhumans, extropians, metamorphosists, and cryonicists unite!</i><br>
<p>
You could also have included the CRSociety, and Longevity-digest lists<br>
and the sci.cryonics and sci.life-extension newsgroups.<br>
 <br>
While they all want indefinitely extended life-span (although I am not<br>
sure this is true of all transhumanists), the different lists are<br>
appropriate because of differences in emphasis and personal priorities.<br>
Often, those dedicated to one list (and consequent activities) will be<br>
quite determined that those dedicated to the other list (and its<br>
activities) are sadly misguided, at best, in their piorities. Usually,<br>
those active on the lists are very inactive about actually *doing*<br>
something which will increase the chance of the list's ostensible<br>
purpose being fulfilled. ie. the *real and effective* purpose of the<br>
list is to *talk* about (and therefore *appear* active) and to *evade*<br>
the fact that one is not actually *doing* anything *effective* about<br>
that which one is professing to devoutly desire.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I place my faith in life.</i><br>
<p>
I place any faith that I allow myself, in *myself and others* who are<br>
*doing* all that we reasonably can to give everyone a reasonable chance<br>
to stay alive.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Any who place faith in same belief and practice as</i><br>
<i>&gt;I support my cause and I should treat with respect and friendship.</i><br>
<p>
Not if their similarities in personal philosophy are restricted to just<br>
wanting to continue to stay alive indefinitely. Respect for that desire,<br>
yes, but unfortunately, some with that desire may be so antithetical to<br>
ones other major philsophical viewpoints that one cannot possibly call<br>
them friends.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;I do not want to be unknown person posting messages!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let us know who we are!</i><br>
<i>&gt;We probably do not know each other; that does not help us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tell me who you are; I want to know you.</i><br>
<p>
First, it is doubtful that one person can ever truly *know* another. We<br>
have enough trouble knowing *ourselves*.<br>
<p>
Second, message correspondence *is* a reasonably effective first step in<br>
getting to know someone. Live and dynamic phone conversations would be<br>
next. In person discussions and *doing* things together are best of all.<br>
<p>
Finally, getting to know someone better can actually have a negative<br>
effect. I may be much more able to be respectful and cooperative with<br>
someone, it I *don't* know that their personal philosophy is in such<br>
conflict with mine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let us know what you think should be done, what need be done.</i><br>
<i>&gt;What are your problems?.</i><br>
<p>
I think that most people *are* doing this in the messages that they<br>
post. For me, it means giving all your time and money that is not<br>
absolutely necessary for your current life extension program towards<br>
research to perfect suspended animation. This is my first priority<br>
simply because I believe that it has a better time-to-achievement vs<br>
cost relationship than any other potentially life-span extending<br>
research (including, anti-aging/rejuvenation, nanotechnology, uploading,<br>
etc). It should be the fail-safe/backup (to avoid *death* - the end of<br>
any possible life) to these other methods which will be needed to allow<br>
*continued* life. *After* the fail-safe/backup is *effectively*<br>
in-place, it will be time to put all ones efforts toward solving the<br>
fundamental problems of continued life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Tell me what you want;</i><br>
<i>&gt;if I were your slave for life what would I do?</i><br>
<p>
I have no need or desire for slaves. As a slave, you would not be fully<br>
*alive*. I desire *life* in myself and others. Therefore, I would rebuke<br>
your efforts and ask you to set yourself *free*.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Help me help you.</i><br>
<p>
You can help me best, by becoming convinced of my priorities and doing,<br>
in your own best way, whatever you can to further them as a free person<br>
and an associate.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let us get organized to do more than talk, to control our lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let us work together and cooperate.</i><br>
<p>
In the ways described above, I totally agree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What are we doing?</i><br>
<i>&gt;I learn and teach; I want to learn what you want me to teach you.</i><br>
<p>
Sorry, but most of the knowledge I desire cannot be *taught*. It can<br>
only be *learned*. It will not help *me* much if *you* learn it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What can we do?</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can be filled with doubt and not be able to answer this question, </i><br>
<p>
It is sincere and inspiring that you admit it. Many do not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;though there is no thing I can not do if I try hard enough.</i><br>
<p>
I used to think the same thing. Unfortunately, will-power and<br>
determination are not enough. If a large number of us couple "try hard<br>
enough" with all our other positive attributes, we may yet succeed in<br>
vastly extending our lives. Anything less is likely to fail.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;What can we not do?</i><br>
<i>&gt;I can not be immortal yet and it makes me sad, afraid, and angry.</i><br>
<p>
Well spoken! Just don't get so "sad, afraid, and angry" that these<br>
negative emotions cause you to be impotent about finding a solution as<br>
is the case for so many.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let us learn how we could do it, then do it.</i><br>
<p>
By all means, yes!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We need a plan;</i><br>
<i>&gt;if you listen to me I will give you one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Follow me, </i><br>
<i>&gt;you will be led;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sit on your ass,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you will be dead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You choose and you choose now!</i><br>
<p>
This sounds too much like the "come-on" of a guru/cult-leader for my<br>
taste.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If I get one person motivated and bring their brain to life </i><br>
<i>&gt;we will be one step closer to our goals.</i><br>
<p>
True if their brain is not already alive. However, this might be taken<br>
as an insult to many of us whose brains *are* alive and who have been<br>
"trying hard" for many more years than you have.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;WAKE up!</i><br>
<i>&gt;We are DYING!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Our DNA is being TORN APART by free radicals!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Bacteria, virus, and fungus are DEVOURING our cells!</i><br>
<i>&gt;We are eating TOXINS!</i><br>
<i>&gt;People are STARVING!</i><br>
<i>&gt;People are KILLING each other and themselves!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Natural DISASTER is known world-wide!</i><br>
<p>
All very true and very sad. And something that every one on these lists<br>
knows.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;How much time is wasted? </i><br>
<i>&gt;...too much; </i><br>
<i>&gt;stop playing games and get serious;</i><br>
<i>&gt;this is our life we are talking about!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Am I ALONE trying to stop this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;HELP ME HELP YOU!</i><br>
<p>
No, you are not alone. I and a few others are "trying our hardest" and<br>
being as effective as we can. In my view, your exhortation is<br>
appropriate and reasonable, although, when I did less than this at the<br>
beginning of the Prometheus Project, I was roundly criticised for<br>
insulting people and questioning their motives and priorities. <br>
