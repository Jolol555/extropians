<i>&gt;Its our society and the scarcity and cost of chimps, virtually all</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the great apes are at some point between endangered and extinct. </i><br>
<p>
But we seem to have large numbers of fast breeding monkeys for lab<br>
experiments.  Couldn't we breed more of these fast if we had<br>
substantial other uses for them? <br>

<i>&gt;It's difficult and expensive to program a monkey to perform a task, and when</i><br>
<i>&gt;you're finished all you have is one trained monkey. It might be just as </i><br>
<i>&gt;difficult to train a primitive AI to do the task, but when you're finished </i><br>
<i>&gt;you have millions of trained AIs.                  </i><br>
<p>
This applies if the limiting step is training them for each task.  But<br>
from the discussion here it seems that the problem is really<br>
domesticating them enough so they choose to do the tasks given them.<br>
So the puzzle is why we haven't been able to domesticate them yet.<br>
<p>
CurtAdams@aol.com<br>
<i>&gt;While aggression, dominance games, and shirking work would probably</i><br>
<i>&gt;help a monkey's reproduction, it's going to be counterproductive for</i><br>
<i>&gt;an AI, at least as long as AIs depend on humans for reproduction.</i><br>
<p>
This behavior may have helped monkeys in the past, but it is counter<br>
productive now.  So will it take AIs a similarly long time to figure<br>
out what behavior is in their interest?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Long domestication tends to make animals more docile (e.g. dogs vs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;wolves) and AIs will presumably start out docile, from both design</i><br>
<i>&gt;goals and (presumably) little need for self-motivation in the early</i><br>
<i>&gt;stages.</i><br>
<p>
I think you're arguing that docility is irrelevant to increasing<br>
intelligence.  But maybe self-motivation is important to the process.<br>

Anders Sandberg writes:<br>
<i>&gt;The main problem with using other lifeforms for various tasks is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;they are usually evolved for something completely different. It is</i><br>
<i>&gt;better to evolve life that fits the task or change the task so it</i><br>
<i>&gt;fits the life than forcing life to adapt to the task. </i><br>
<p>
This seems to go against the idea of general intelligent agents, able<br>
to quickly adapt themselves to different tasks.  <br>
<p>
OK, given all this intelligent comment, I can reframe the puzzle.  Why<br>
is it that it seems to most people more promising to build up smart<br>
cooperative agents from scratch, as in an AI approach, than to<br>
domesticate existing very smart but not cooperative-enough agents?  Is<br>
domestication really that hard compared to learning how to organize<br>
intelligence and acquiring all that common sense knowledge?<br>
<p>
Sure some tasks have physical environments and timescales requiring<br>
human-made computers.  But this doesn't apply to most tasks now doen<br>
by humans.<br>
