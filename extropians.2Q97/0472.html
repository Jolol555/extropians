Army's anti-terrorist drills frighten, anger city dwellers<br>
<p>
BY DANA PRIEST<br>
Washington Post<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON -- A dozen U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters, their lights<br>
out, descended from the night sky March 4 on a corner of Charlotte, N.C.<br>
They swooped among the high-rise apartment buildings, then dropped<br>
dozens of special operations troops, some with their weapons blasting,<br>
into an abandoned warehouse to capture a group of ``terrorists.''<br>
<p>
Some terrified residents grabbed their guns. Others ducked into<br>
doorways. The 911 line went crazy, as did Mayor Pat McCrory's telephone<br>
line.<br>
<p>
``I could barely hear the callers because of the helicopter noise and<br>
the gunfire in the background,'' McCrory recalled.<br>
<p>
Neither McCrory nor his police chief was sure what was going on. But<br>
they had a clue: Three months earlier, two men in jeans and T-shirts<br>
from the secretive U.S. Army Special Operations Command had visited<br>
McCrory's office to ask permission to conduct urban counterterrorism<br>
exercises they said would go unnoticed. McCrory signed a confidentiality<br>
statement agreeing not to disclose the event beforehand for national<br>
security's sake.<br>
<p>
``We were misled,'' said McCrory, who was forced by the public outcry to<br>
kick the Army out of Charlotte after the first of what was to have been<br>
three days of urban anti-terrorism training.<br>
<p>
``How they thought you could come in and out without any disturbance is<br>
beyond me. It was almost like a blitzkrieg operation. People went and<br>
got their guns. I feel fortunate no one was hurt.''<br>
<p>
Over the last three years, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command has<br>
conducted at least 21 such exercises in 21 U.S. cities, including<br>
Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, New Orleans,<br>
Miami, Pittsburgh and Seattle.<br>
<p>
In city after city, the exercises have drawn fire from frightened<br>
residents who are not told beforehand that the several roaring<br>
helicopters flying in circles several hundred feet overhead late at<br>
night -- blacked out except for a tiny red taillight for safety -- are<br>
trying to get as close as possible to the buildings they appear about to<br>
crash into.<br>
<p>
The confusion and fear caused by their invasion is compounded when<br>
residents see dark-suited figures slide down ropes dangling from the<br>
choppers and then begin firing loud blanks from their assault weapons.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Real explosives<br>
<p>
The simulated sound of grenades and incoming artillery often follows, as<br>
does, in some cases, the sound of real, small breaching explosives used<br>
to blast open doors.<br>
<p>
To top it off, local police are on hand to keep traffic away from the<br>
exercise site -- typically an abandoned warehouse, jail or apartment<br>
building -- but often refuse to tell motorists what the commotion is all<br>
about.<br>
<p>
News media offices and 911 operators, who are not alerted to the<br>
exercises beforehand, also cannot provide information. Several callers<br>
to state law enforcement agencies have been told to call the Defense<br>
Department in Washington.<br>
<p>
Last June, troops were forced to leave Pittsburgh early because of the<br>
uproar. In Houston, a night's exercise was cut short when a helicopter<br>
landed hard, rolled over and its two occupants were hospitalized.<br>
Thousands of callers to local media there demanded that the troops leave<br>
town. ``Who invited them?'' demanded one caller.<br>
<p>
Lt. Col. Pete Pierce of Special Operations Command said the Army<br>
retreated early from Charlotte because the operations were more<br>
disruptive than anticipated. He said people on the streets closest to<br>
the exercises were notified just before the maneuvers but, he added,<br>
``in the process of notification, people are going to get missed.''<br>
<p>
Army officials argue that only cities give troops the chance to work on<br>
real-life challenges, such as using night-vision equipment in partially<br>
lit areas, avoiding power lines and dropping troops quickly enough to go<br>
virtually unnoticed by the citizenry.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Safety in secrecy<br>
<p>
It is safer for the troops to descend in secret than to alert residents<br>
and risk the sightseeing crowds that would gather, said one Army<br>
official, who added: ``And they don't want their equipment photographed.<br>
They don't want their tactics, operations and procedures known.''<br>
<p>
As the threat of urban terrorism abroad has increased, Army officials<br>
say it has become all the more important that their troops be skilled at<br>
flying into an urban obstacle course of skyscrapers and towers and<br>
inserting teams of special operations troops: Green Berets, Rangers, the<br>
160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment and the super-secret Delta<br>
Force. Such troops would likely be deployed abroad to rescue hostages,<br>
capture enemies and kill terrorists.<br>
<p>
``I can't imagine there isn't an American around who wouldn't want these<br>
guys to be as good as they can be,'' said Army Lt. Col. Ray Whitehead.<br>
``This is real serious stuff.''<br>
<p>
The exercises also draw criticism from citizens worried that the Army<br>
may be secretly training local police and SWAT teams, which is forbidden<br>
by U.S. law under most circumstances.<br>
<p>
The possible participation of U.S. troops in the 1993 Branch Davidian<br>
debacle near Waco, Texas, in which more than 80 people died, is still<br>
hotly debated within some circles.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Alliances restricted<br>
<p>
U.S. law greatly restricts the type of training the military may conduct<br>
with domestic law enforcement agencies. Pierce said local law<br>
enforcement agencies only provide support by blocking off roads, for<br>
example. Never, he said, did they train with special operations troops.<br>
<p>
But some local police believe that joint training is part of the<br>
exercise.<br>
<p>
Such was the case in Pittsburgh, where the Army brought in 14<br>
helicopters and 200 special forces troops last June.<br>
<p>
Craig Edwards, assistant superintendent of the Allegheny County Police<br>
Department, said the Army exercise was ``a big joint effort'' that<br>
trained city and county SWAT police. ``We thought it went extremely<br>
well. Naturally, being police officers, we thought it was extremely<br>
necessary.''<br>
<p>
But asked for a further description of the training, Lt. Bert Cifrulak,<br>
Pittsburgh's SWAT team leader, said Edwards was mistaken. ``We conducted<br>
no training with them and we provided no training,'' he said. ``We sort<br>
of acted like tour guides'' by identifying sites, he said.<br>
