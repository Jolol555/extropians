<i>        &gt;Trained demagogues who are supposed to infiltrate Cuba. [...] When</i><br>
<i>        &gt;you see big demonstrations in the Tv, like in Bosnia, Bulgaria etc.,</i><br>
<i>        &gt;this can only be the effect of media propaganda. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, it must be outside agitators, I certainly can't think of any other<br>
explanation why people would be unhappy to live in a totalitarian country. <br>
The western agents are not just demagogues, they're also skillful actors, <br>
they can scream just as if they were being tortured, make themselves look <br>
thin like they were starving and even play dead so well they start to rot. <br>
Very talented fellows, but evil of course.          <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Castro isn't a bum, he will keep this [western] influence as low as</i><br>
<i>        &gt;possible, not because he wants to keep his power but because he</i><br>
<i>        &gt;knows that many people would suffer otherwise.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Absolutely. The idea that Castro could be interested in power for its own<br>
sake is pure libel, a lie concocted by those nasty media people and financed<br>
by big business and aliens in the spaceship following comet Hale Bopp.<br>
<p>
Everybody knows that that you'll never find a nicer bunch of people than <br>
dictators, I can't think of even one example from History where they've been <br>
anything but true humanitarians, kind, gentle, nurturing and brilliant <br>
economists. They only want to help people, power is not important to a tyrant. <br>
A day without Castro is like a day without sunshine.<br>
                       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Cuba is, besides North Korea, one of the last socialist regimes</i><br>
<i>        &gt;which doesn't privatize itself too much.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
North Korea? NORTH KOREA!!! Erik, I know you consider individual freedom to<br>
be a great evil and certainly North Korea doesn't have a bit of it, but do<br>
you think that virtue totally compensates for it also being one of the poorest <br>
most backward places on Earth? Do you really want to hold up this hellhole as <br>
an example deserving of special merit because it "doesn't privatize itself <br>
too much", is this the direction you want us to go?<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Cuba doesn't supress any abilities, it just prevents people from</i><br>
<i>        &gt;becoming richer than necessary.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly, socialism can't make poor people rich but it can do something just<br>
as good, it can make rich people poor.<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;With the US, a main trade partner is gone. Economic impoverishment</i><br>
<i>        &gt;is a direct consequence of this.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Some might say that if you want to be prosperous then treat your main<br>
customer well, and if you don't then don't expect him to want to continue<br>
trading with you, but of course these unenlightened people don't understand<br>
the glories of socialism and dictatorship.<br>
                                  <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The war in Bosnia was a product of western capitalist countries,</i><br>
<i>        &gt;designed to change power structures in that region and to push arms</i><br>
<i>        &gt;industry.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
And to think, the dupes of the western media thought the war was<br>
caused by centuries of religious and ethnic strife. I'm sure big business<br>
started the war somehow, I just don't know how, and lots of companies <br>
made a fortune off it, I just can't think of one.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The wall in Germany fell because of massive media propaganda. Kohl</i><br>
<i>        &gt;himself admitted this afterwards and said it would not have been</i><br>
<i>        &gt;possible without western media. </i><br>
                          <br>
<p>
Do you think a wall and a policy of shooting people in the back if they<br>
try to climb it when they attempt to escape a workers paradise is appropriate <br>
behavior, or would this sort of thing be better suited for a prison?<br>
Assuming for the sake of argument that what you say is true, Is the fall of<br>
the wall supposed to make us think that the western media did a bad thing? <br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Many tourists are disappointed after their travel to Cuba because </i><br>
<i>        &gt;there was no single prostitute. Even in Havana you will find hardly </i><br>
<i>        &gt;more prostitutes than in Berlin or Cologne.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I wish you told me that yesterday, anybody want to buy my airplane ticket to<br>
Havana?  I wonder what the weather is like in Berlin or Cologne this time<br>
of year.<br>
                     <br>
<i>        &gt;A good economy is not only characterized by its growth or size, but</i><br>
<i>        &gt;also by the distribution of wealth and the inequality. That's what</i><br>
<i>        &gt;Libertarians always forget. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
This Libertarian has not forgotten it, in fact I think redistribution of<br>
wealth is a fine idea, provided of course I get to do it. I'd be real good <br>
at determining who has too much money and who doesn't have enough,<br>
I'd be real good. I promise I'll never use my power for personal gain, <br>
heaven forbid, I only want to do good. You can trust me, I never lie,<br>
I'll be just as fair as Castro or Stalin.<br>
