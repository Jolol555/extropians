On Monday, April 21, 1997, Eugene Leitl forwarded a post that Anders <br>
Sandberg made to sci.nanotech about nanodevices in regolith and how <br>
these might be used to construct macro-scale devices such as <br>
communication antennas.  As Anders put it:<br>
&lt;Making the nanodevices build something macroscopic can probably be <br>
done using chemical signals.  A simple example could be that <br>
assemblers are sensitive to the presence of waste products from other <br>
assemblers, and tend to move away from them (increasing the spread <br>
along the surface). One could implement many different chemical <br>
signals such as "Assembler this way" (to make mining devices find the <br>
assemblers) or "Build communications link" (produced by nanocomputers <br>
with no links). This is the fun part, essentially what we need is a <br>
system of chemical signals not unlike in an anthill combined with the <br>
morphogenic chemicals used in early development to design the <br>
macro-level structures. Any good ideas for suitable chemicals and <br>
organisations of this system? &gt;<br>
<p>
Eugene subsequently forwarded a message from Ralph Merkle to the <br>
Nanotechnology Study Group &lt;NSG-d@world.std.com&gt;, that suggested a few <br>
URLs that might have been relevant to Anders' query.<br>
<p>
However, a quick scan of Merkle's pages at Xerox didn't show anything <br>
along the lines Anders was suggesting, just the orthodox <br>
command-and-control nanotech approaches of 'positional control' and <br>
'self-replication'.  In fact, Merkle suggests (at <br>
<a href="http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/selfRep.html">http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/selfRep.html</a>):<br>
&lt;The mechanical designs proposed for nanotechnology are more <br>
reminiscent of a factory than of a living system. Molecular scale <br>
robotic arms able to move and position molecular parts would assemble <br>
rather rigid molecular products using methods more familiar to a <br>
machine shop than the complex brew of chemicals found in a cell. <br>
Although we are inspired by living systems, the actual designs are <br>
likely to owe more to design constraints and our human objectives than <br>
to living systems.&gt;<br>
<p>
In the same essay, Merkle later says:<br>
&lt;If artificial self replicating systems will only function in <br>
carefully controlled artificial environments, how can we develop <br>
applications of nanotechnology that function in complex environments, <br>
such as the inside of the human body or a (rather messy) factory <br>
floor? While self replicating systems are the key to low cost, there <br>
is no need (and little desire) to have such systems function in the <br>
outside world. Instead, in an artificial and controlled environment <br>
they can manufacture simpler and more rugged systems that can then be <br>
transferred to their final destination.&gt;<br>
<p>
Congratulations to Anders for coming up with a scenario that <br>
challenges this approach.<br>
<p>
More recently, Eugene posted &gt;H FYI: NASA Explains How Molecular-Sized <br>
Gears Might Work, a post by Bruce Mackenzie to the NSG forwarding a <br>
NASA press release from those responsible for the NASA URL Merkle <br>
mentioned:<br>
&lt;One practical use of nanotechnology would be to build a "matter <br>
compiler," said Creon Levit, a Globus colleague at Ames. "We would <br>
give this machine, made of nano parts, some raw materials, like <br>
natural gas, for example.  A computer program would specify an <br>
arrangement of atoms, and the matter compiler would arrange the atoms <br>
from the raw materials to make a macro-scale machine or parts," Levit <br>
added.&gt;<br>
<p>
Later in this NASA press release, Globus is cited saying:<br>
&lt;"We would like to write computer programs that would enable <br>
assembler/replicators to make aerospace materials, parts and machines <br>
in atomic detail," he said.  "Such materials should have tremendous <br>
strength and thermal properties."  Further information on these <br>
materials can be obtained on the researchers' Internet page at URL:<br>
               <a href="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/nanotechnology">http://www.nas.nasa.gov/nanotechnology</a>.  &gt;<br>
<p>
Well, I have to admit that I didn't take the time to look at these <br>
NASA pages in any detail; but, somehow I doubt, from what the NASA <br>
people have said above, that they have looked at the type of <br>
approaches Anders was suggesting.<br>
<p>
I don't want to restart the flame wars over whether 'positional <br>
control' is practical for building macro-scale devices or not, and I <br>
guess I'll just have to wait for Anders to finish his article, but I <br>
would be very interested to know if he has found anyone working on the <br>
chemical-signaling approach to nano-construction that he was <br>
suggesting.<br>
