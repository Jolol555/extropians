This is a limited view.  The Beyond allows a limited standard of living<br>
to its inhabitants, from the POV of a Power.  Complex, sub-Power<br>
civilizations can evolve in the Beyond; intelligent species evolve in<br>
the Slow Zone.  The Nyjoran pattern of Slow races stumbling out of the<br>
Slowness was mentioned to be a common one.  Races won't evolve in the<br>
Beyond; it's overrun.  It'd be like leaving a zone of methane pools on<br>
Earth so that new forms of life could evolve, whereas they have no<br>
chance now.<br>

And the Depths could protect gas clouds from Slow Zone ramjets.<br>

<p>
You mean Beyond to the outside of the Core, and Slowness within?  Small<br>
volume for evolution of new races.<br>

Hmm.  Is _Fire_ the first synthesis of extropianism and intense<br>
conservationism?<br>

And even priests were coming to spend some time in it, because of the<br>
collection of religious books.  There were one thousand, two hundred and<br>
eighty-three religious books in there now, each one--according to<br>
itself--the only one any man need ever read.  It was sort of nice to see<br>
them all together. -- Terry Pratchett, _Small Gods_<br>
