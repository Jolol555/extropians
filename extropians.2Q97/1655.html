It might be a tad overzealous to ask "how exactly?"<br>

Agreed.<br>
<p>

<p>
If ability is a matter of information, then as an upload, no known<br>
ability is out of reach. However, it seems unlikely to me (stick neck<br>
out) that an ability arises out of a mere confluence of data. Skills<br>
like playing the piano don't seem to arise out of your knowledge of<br>
music since an eye-hand motor skill is involved. Similarly, while a<br>
doctorate degree may be conferred along with the corresponding<br>
informational foundation, the ability to synthesize the data is a<br>
product of training in the particular field. I wonder if<br>
"hunch-tendency" is even a separate and correspndingly programmable<br>
trait?<br>
<p>
At the very least, despite the fact that mere information may not confer<br>
actual ability, a database of all human kowledge accessible by an upload<br>
at speeds beyond any we might fathom is definitely an advantage -- all<br>
with perfect recall, and all at the burst of a thought. <br>
<p>
It sure beats studying.           <br>
