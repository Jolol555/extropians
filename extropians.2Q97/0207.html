<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Most people care more than you about what other people will respect in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  them and desire from them, but perhaps your children will be like you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  here.  Even so, you surely want your children to have realistic</i><br>
<i>&gt;  expectations about what sort of things are possible for them.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;  don't want them to think they can fly by jumping off the roof and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  flapping their arms.  And if, for example, they announce their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  interest in being a movie star, princess, professional basketball</i><br>
<i>&gt;  player, or astronaut, you probably want to make it clear these are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  long shots.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
I dare to think that Extropians have gone beyond this kind of limit teaching.<br>
This very meme is what I encounter expicitly when i speak of Extropy. <br>
<p>
I was really surprised to see it on this list. Dynamic Optimism does indeed<br>
 mean getting a REALISTIC view, so astronaut or athlete or artist  would not<br>
be an easy task, I need to tell a child it entail lots of work; a true<br>
talent; perserverence of great magnitude... but to call it a 'long shot' is<br>
to *discourage* them from ever trying! ...dynamic pessimism?? Its a kindly<br>
meme parents often use to protect their kids from failing -and terrifying to<br>
me, yikes!<br>
