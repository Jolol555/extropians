I will try evaluate the possible terms of morphological and gradual<br>
uploadings.<br>
<p>
In 1946 one MIPS cost about 150 M$, in 1981 - 10 k$, in 1995 - 10 $. After<br>
simple calculations I have got, that mean annual coefficient of computational<br>
power growth was:<br>
1.32 times/year  - during 1946 - 1981 years period,<br>
1.64 times/year  - during 1981 - 1995 years priod.<br>
<p>
I believe, we can affirm that brain power is between 10^13 and 10^18 sinapses<br>
per second. Let us assume, that 1 sinapse processing require 10-1000 floating<br>
operations. So, the necessary computation power will be 10^14 - 10^21 FLOPS.<br>
<p>
If we would take 1981 - 1995 coefficient (1.64) and most powerful current<br>
computer (2*10^12 FLOPS) we will got that brain power computer will arose<br>
between 2005 and 2039 years.<br>
<p>
The brain power computer is not sufficient condition for morphological uploading,<br>
of course. Scaning, decoding and ethical problems can very postpone these<br>
possibilities. But for humanoid AI (according to Carl Feynman classification)<br>
these problems will not so bigs. In this case, we can expect, that human<br>
power AI would arose earlier than uploading possibilities. I have some doubts<br>
about slow evolution human and fast evolution AI co-existence possibility.<br>
I think that during 10 - 20 years such co-existence the human society would<br>
have a big danger of degradation.<br>
<p>
So, I think, the full human uploading should be possible during 2005 - 2060<br>
years. In other case we have a chance, that it will not be possible never.<br>
<p>
More optimistic I see the gradual uploading perspectives. We have a good chance,<br>
that sufficiently brain - computer interface will be created during 0 - 10<br>
years (if even one current project will be successful). The necessary computer<br>
power would be lessen than in the morphological uploading case. In any case,<br>
I think, the gradual uploading will not be implemented later that humanoid AI.<br>
It can be implemented almost at once after necessary computers creation (I<br>
believe about 2015).<br>
<p>
Still more, already now we can expect some seriously results concerning<br>
gradual uploading to the other brains. Let the brain-brain interface is<br>
incomplite, let these experiments would be with animals only, some urgent<br>
results is possible in the nearest future.<br>
<p>
Best regards,<br>
