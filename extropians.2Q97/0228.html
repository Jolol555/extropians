While I am intrigued by the possibilities of many new drugs for<br>
enhancement of the human experience, I still take none, because I<br>
am distressed by the complete lack of real information about them<br>
available to me, and I wonder what might be done to fix that.<br>
<p>
I have spent hours scouring web pages, magazines, in search of<br>
some morsel of fact; but I find only speculation and anecdotes.<br>
I really /want/ there to be something real in them, but I cannot<br>
bet my life and my health on anything I've seen so far.  Is it<br>
so hard to do a few simple controlled experiments?  Is there some<br>
law that "information" can't have actual numbers in it, but has to<br>
be written like ad copy?  Don't these writers know that by writing<br>
anecdote after anecdote, implication after implication, that they<br>
are undermining their own credibility?  A single table full of<br>
real numbers is worth more than 1000 pages of glowing endorsements<br>
and bullshit hype like "natural", "safe", "well-known", "increased<br>
vitality", "antitoxins", "dramatic effects".<br>
<p>
I'm not even looking for fancy university-funded doctor-performed<br>
research, just some basic honesty.  Informal experiments among<br>
friends--but with placebo controls, measured effects, and complete,<br>
honest disclosure of results and methods sufficient to allow any<br>
reader to compute statistical significance and judge its value.<br>
<p>
Let's take some simple "smart drug", for example.  How hard would<br>
it be to find a dozen people, give them some simple cognitive skill<br>
tests, then give half the drug and half a placebo, give the tests<br>
again, and print all the numbers?  We could do it in a few hours<br>
at a party, and repeat the ones that showed promise to get better<br>
sample size.   The fact that numbers like these are never printed<br>
makes me suspicious of the whole supplement industry.<br>
<p>
[P.S. In an earlier thread here, I accused alternative medical<br>
practitioners and supplement sellers of being generally charlatans,<br>
which I still do.  In particular, though, I was asked to go look at<br>
the actual labels of supplement bottles to verify that they had no<br>
specific health claims.  I did, and they don't.  They do, however,<br>
still contain reams of meaningless ad copy, and the magazines and<br>
books on the next shelf over have actual health claims, and have<br>
lots of supplement ads, so I am no less of the opinion that these<br>
people are generally charlatans.  I would honestly like to think<br>
otherwise, but I have no evidence to base that belief on.]<br>
