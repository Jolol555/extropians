            MIT PHYSICS OF COMPUTATION SEMINAR<br>
<p>
            Date: Tuesday, May 20 1997<br>
            Time: 3:30 pm  (Refreshments after the talk)<br>
            Room: MIT NE43, 8th floor AI Playroom (545 Tech Sq)<br>

    "Imperfect Computers"<br>

<p>
    Abstract:<br>
<p>
    We have built a reconfigurable computer with 0.22 square meters of<br>
    CMOS silicon in 864 chips, three quarters of which have known<br>
    defects. The Teramac custom computer can be thought of as a giant<br>
    programmable gate array with half a billion configuration bits.<br>
    The large number of configuration bits and the two million wires<br>
    available for routing make it very easy to place and route logic<br>
    designs onto the physical network without depending on an unbroken<br>
    symmetry in the physical network.<br>
    <br>
    Teramac is big enough to let us begin to explore some of the<br>
    issues which will be faced by architects of the first nanoscale<br>
    computers. How do we make a computer with nanometer scale<br>
    components?  To make a computer we need not only small components<br>
    but a method of connecting them in a reasonably arbitrary way,<br>
    chosen by the computer designer.  Most self assembling strategies<br>
    at the molecular scale create very regular structures which lack<br>
    the complexity required of a computer.  More elaborate assembly<br>
    strategies are likely to be very imperfect.  The topology of the<br>
    Teramac interconnect is regular only in its fractal<br>
    dimensionality. The place and route software does not depend on<br>
    significant symmetry.  If you have enough wires and switches you<br>
    can first build an imperfect machine and then design a perfect<br>
    one.<br>

This talk is part of a seminar series on adapting computers and<br>
computations to the constraints of, and opportunities afforded by,<br>
microphysics; and on the development and application of the physical<br>
theory of computation and information.  This seminar series is<br>
supported by the MIT AI Laboratory's Reversible Computing Project.<br>
