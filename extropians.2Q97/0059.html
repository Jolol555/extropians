        How do you come to that conclusion?<br>

        [Bring out my age-old generic response here.] You forget that this<br>
is merely a list that deals with the arguments and information provided by<br>
like-minded people...a list exclusively made for such discourse.  Most (if<br>
not all) on this list do more for extropy than check their mail every hour<br>
and subscribe to a few magazines.  Extropy's something that I cannot even<br>
comprehend being idle and wishy-washy about.  I would wager that most people<br>
on this list were extropians before they even heard the term spoken.<br>
However, your argument appears similar to arguing whether a whisper is more<br>
effective than a shout...they both have their place.  What *is*<br>
disappointing is the SIGNAL:NOISE ratio.  Currently we have a lot of NOISE<br>
going on this list (my post included) as opposed to the desired SIGNAL.  It<br>
isn't hard to get SIGNAL happening, but first you must relinquish the NOISE.<br>
Nothing's stopping any of us from generating SIGNAL and complaining about it<br>
isn't doing anything.  So who is going to aim their stone?  <br>
