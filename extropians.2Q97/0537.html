It survives by people fiddling with it by adding new fields, new types of<br>
dark matter, or a nonzero vacuum density (AKA cosmological constant). These<br>
effects  change the acceleration of the expansion so that the universe is<br>
comfortably older than the objects in it.<br>
<p>
All the fiddles I understand (i.e. from two years ago) seem to have been<br>
ruled out observationally, but there's plenty of room for new fiddles, or<br>
combinations of two or more old  fiddles.  I can no longer keep track of<br>
which combination of fiddles is the current front-runner.  It remains to be<br>
seen whether the fiddling will suceed, or whether the Big Bang theory will<br>
be replaced by something totally new.  I'd bet on the fiddling succeeding,<br>
but I'm hoping for total replacement.  Either way, progress is being made<br>
very rapidly, and we should know lots more soon.  Science usually doesn't<br>
stay this confused for long.<br>
