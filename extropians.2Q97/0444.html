<i>&gt;his human powered airplanes in the 80's to win such prizes put up by</i><br>
<i>&gt;private organizations, doing a mile loop, then spanning the English</i><br>
<i>&gt;Channel, and then the course from Crete to Greece that was mythically</i><br>

I have a paper "Patterns of Patronage: Why Grants Won Over Prizes in<br>
Science" (<a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/whygrants.ps">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/whygrants.ps</a>), with an<br>
empirical study that suggests that the reason the once common prize<br>
was replaced by grants was that governments became the dominant<br>
research patron.  So the current infrequency of prizes relative to<br>
grants should not overly discourage private patrons from using prizes.<br>
Prizes can be an excellent mechanism.<br>
