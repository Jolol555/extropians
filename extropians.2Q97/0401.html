I see no reason for the production of clones to translate into social<br>
pressure to conform.  One could easily argue just the opposite, that<br>
large populations of clones would desperately search out ways to<br>

Growth rates should be largely controlled by room to grow in.  Such<br>
beings might be unwilling to grow rapidly if this involved much personal<br>
risk, but there are ways around that, especially in an SF future.  And I<br>
don't see the problem with long term investments being normal.  In fact,<br>
such a mentality would indicate that they would spend a lot of time<br>
trying to foresee, forestall, and hedge against ecological disasters<br>
and threats of many kinds.  Redundancy and flexibility.<br>
