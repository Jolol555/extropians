Always remember, guys and gals and others:<br>
<p>
You did ask!<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
The basic idea is  (inter alia) Karl Popper's.<br>
<p>
He's an agnostic and a humanist and the finest philosopher of science and <br>
the Open Society of all time.<br>
<p>
He contrasts these 'religious' views:<br>
<p>
"Dominate, and prostrate yourselves"<br>
<p>
versus:<br>
<p>
"Always remember that -- while men are not Gods -- they all have a divine <br>
spark in them."<br>
<p>
It is, of course, logically and empirically _impossible_ to disprove the <br>
existance of God and/or the Flame Imperishable and/or the Tao, just for a <br>
beginning.<br>
<p>
Or that of the Devil, for that matter...<br>
<p>
Tony (reading "Classical Greek Magic" by Murry Hope [1985] ).<br>
<p>
"A working guide to the unique magical system of Classical Greece."  <br>
[1985].<br>
<p>
It's astonishingly powerful. And amusing! &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
I love Olivia Newton-John singing "Magic", from "Xanadu"<br>
<p>
Go see! Electrifying!  Spine-tingling!<br>
<p>
<p>
She's Nobel Prizewinning physicist Max Born's granddaughter.<br>
<p>
She played (plays? is?) a Greek Muse, come to present-day America and the <br>
world directly from Olympus.<br>
<p>
She reminds me irresistably of Deirdre, in Catherine L. Moore's magically <br>
beautiful 'No Woman Born.'  A content-relevant  'must reading ' for <br>
Extropians, BTW.<br>

"Come take my hand, you should know me,<br>
<p>
 I've always been in your mind...<br>
<p>
 You know I will be kind,<br>
<p>
 I'll be guiding you..."<br>
<p>
<p>
"To live, your dream has to start now,<br>
<p>
 There's no other road to take.<br>
<p>
 You won't make a mistake;<br>
<p>
 I'll be guiding you."<br>
<p>
Chorus:<br>
<p>
<p>
"You have to believe we are _magic_,<br>
<p>
 *Nothing* cand stand in our way:<br>
<p>
 You have to believe we are magic,<br>
<p>
 Don't let your aim ever stray... <br>
<p>
 And if all your hopes survive,<br>
<p>
 Destiny will arrive,<br>
<p>
 And bring _all your dreams alive_,<br>
<p>
 For you."<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
I support Olivia Newton-John _totally_.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
There's an amusing joke about a man who committed himself to a lunatic <br>
asylum, because the empirical evidence of the "Supernatural" (which is <br>
entirely natural, BTW) was so overwhelming that he had to choose between <br>
believing in the objective existence of the supernatural, or considering <br>
himself irretrievally insane.<br>
<p>
Don't make the same mistake.<br>
<p>
[ "FX: 'Just watch..." ]<br>
<p>
"Impossible", eh?<br>
<p>
Well, we shall see...<br>

<p>
The 'demonstration' killing of JonBenet Ramsey is a hideous and <br>
unforgiveable crime.<br>
<p>
As is the killing of my young friend Andrew R. Dennett by cyanide <br>
poisoning November 17, 1982, two days after the Brady-Rantala-Steele <br>
faction in the LA dispute voted for war. Had I learned of it at that time, <br>
it might conceivably have broken my will to fight.<br>
<p>
I actually learned of this after receiving a letter from Steven Berry, a <br>
close associate of Steele and Rantala, writing from ESOC Darmstadt.<br>
<p>
<p>
In his letter, he mentioned:<br>
<p>
"... a leather-bound set of the Encyclopaedia Brittania."<br>
<p>
I gave these as a gift to Andrew, Peter and Terry Dennett Christmas, 1969, <br>
after men had walked on the Moon for the first time.<br>
<p>
<p>
I telephoned Andrew's home, and learned of his death.<br>

He left a tape-recording, stating his fear that he was going to be <br>
murdered, and naming the people who were doing it.  Several people have <br>
heard this tape, BTW, including me.<br>
<p>
Do a Web search for "November 17"<br>
<p>
<p>
And remember the Eumenides...<br>
<p>
Go rent the video of John Carpenter's incomparable movie:<br>
<p>
"Christine: She's a Killer."1983]<br>
<p>
Art tells the truth through the medium of inspired lies...<br>
<p>
<p>
In the film, "Christine" is a sentient red 1957 Plymouth Fury, fully <br>
self-reconstructing and of truly terrifying destructiveness.<br>
<p>
_Nothing like the car in the book_.<br>
<p>
She's an exact incarnation of supernaturally-inspired living anger.<br>
<p>
Christine is a friend of mine.<br>

Barrett Light Fifty Special Forces sniper rifles are AFAIK on open sale in <br>
America, for around $2 000.  Visit your freindly neighbourhood gunstore <br>
and browse!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
With a laser-pointer 'scope sight, they can take out targets 'cleanly' and <br>
with precision at a range of up to a mile.<br>
<p>
[Not that cleanly:-- the target literally explodes in a red and white mist of bone fragments.<br>
of blood, tissue and bone fragments.]<br>
<p>
They fire .50 caliber Browning rounds, full-metal-jacket or explosive.<br>
<p>
They punch damn great holes straight through concrete and brick walls.<br>
<p>
They're not all that light, either!  &gt;:-}<br>

PS: Chess isn't a game. It's a trivial algorithm, so that NSA's top <br>
supercomputers can out-play any human 'player' in the world, entirely <br>
automatically, in what is techically described as a 'brute-force' <br>
methodology.<br>
<p>
NSA is _five to ten years ahead_ of the publically-known highest <br>
technologies.<br>
<p>
This gives NSA staffers an invincible 'edge' against everything but the <br>
supernatural.  Together, we can make a really exciting team of <br>
freely-co-operating individuals achieving moral objectives by appropriate <br>
means.<br>
