John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; described some of the problems with fast<br>
breeders, but missed my pet peeve: the time constant is milliseconds (vs.<br>
minutes or hours for more sensible reactors). That's about enough time for<br>
the control system to tell the operator, "oops." As fond as I am of nuclear<br>
power, I wouldn't want to live downwind of a fast breeder. It does not rely<br>
on a moderator in the same way as a enriched uranium/water (American), or<br>
natural uranium/heavy water (Canadian) reactor: instead of slowing down the<br>
neutrons to meet a resonance point in the nucleus of the fuel, they let the<br>
neutrons slam into the fuel at full power which is the process atomic bombs<br>
use. Whereas a North American reactor can't explode like an atomic bomb,<br>
fast breeders can as I understand it.<br>
<p>
Of course it doesn't take a fast breeder to make plutonium. India got its<br>
atomic bomb from a Canadian reactor. Inefficient, but it worked.<br>
