<p>
Couldn't we talk more  about *habits* -  bad habits, good habits,<br>
micro-habits, macro-habits?  It seems to me that re-programming oneself<br>
is simply (!) a matter of changing one's habits, that's the way of<br>
talking and thinking that gives one 'access' to that level of programming.<br>
In my experience, a new habit, good or bad, can be learnt more easily<br>
than an old habit can be got rid of: a figure I have heard is that it<br>
takes on average 3 months to make a proper dent in destroying an old<br>
habit.  *Very* difficult, but not impossible.<br>

<i>&gt;Regarding ego ( Ego) and bliss... the so called 'spiritual ( which I beleive</i><br>

<i>&gt;the ego ( awareness of the separation between self and reality) is well</i><br>
<i>&gt;known. An interesting topic. It seems to be hardwired into many humans. Some</i><br>

<p>
I agree.  This is a subject that has fascinated me enormously since I<br>
had 'mystical experiences' as a child.  Several times I remember thinking<br>
"Who am I?" so intensely and concentratedly, that my sense of 'self'<br>
suddenly disappeared, and in its place was ... (what?  I could say<br>
something like 'God' consciousness, because that's what it felt like in<br>
a sense, but really I suppose it was just 'pure' consciousness without a<br>
reflexive component).  You could say that 'I' didn't experience it at<br>
all, or you could say 'I' wasn't even there; yet the experience was<br>
perfectly lucid and normal, nothing *looked* any different, but the *<br>
meaning* of it all had undergone a revolution.<br>
<p>
Looking back at that paragraph, I should note that my sense of self<br>
didn't disappear exactly, but was, so to speak, *seen through*.  I still<br>
knew who was who, and what was what in relative terms, but I wasn't*identified<br>
* with anything less than existence, the universe itself.<br>
<p>
I've never had it since then (last time about 12 years old, I think),<br>
although I've tried, and through study I know it's exactly what<br>
Buddhists have spoken of as 'emptiness' of self. I think the reason why<br>
it's been so hard to get as an adult is because when you are a child it's<br>
relatively easy to see the transparency of the 'self'- after all, there<br>
hasn't been that much of it! As you get older, the sense of self has more<br>
history, becomes tougher, more encrusted and more complex, and it becomes<br>
extremely difficult to hold it all together in one thought that could be<br>
'seen through'.<br>
<p>
I reckon there's a lot of room for a modern, scientific, rational form of<br>
mysticism that gets the experiences without the hypno-hype and extra<br>
cosmological baggage.<br>
<p>
Dennett's work makes a great foundation for this, IMHO.  Seeing the<br>
self as a 'virtual captain of the crew' is almost half way there!<br>
<p>
(Why bother?  Believe me, there is *nothing* like that experience; even<br>
psychedelics give merely a weedy little echo of the 'cosmicness' of it.<br>
And I think that sentient beings who *lived* from that perspective could<br>
be immensely powerful and joyful creatures.  Easily able to re-program<br>
themselves, to morph, etc. - in fact, Transhuman!)<br>
