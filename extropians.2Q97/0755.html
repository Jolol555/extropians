<i>&gt;Proof of LSD causing chromozome damage has been both 'proved' and</i><br>
<i>&gt;'disproved' by teams of researchers for and against the theraputic use of</i><br>
<i>&gt;LSD.</i><br>
<p>
I think the example of the charge of LSD causing choromosomal damage is<br>
really much more an example that people will believe what they want no<br>
matter what reason, logic or good scientific proceedures suggest - rather<br>
than that truth is in some way relative. I hope people forgive the long<br>
quote. I think its remarkable how long this meme - LSD causes chromosome<br>
damage - has lasted given that it was basically caused by two bad papers<br>
published in the late 60s and disproved comprehensively also in the late<br>
60s.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the "Psychedelics Encyclopedia" by Peter Stafford (1983, pp 60-61):</i><br>
<p>
"In 1967, Dr. Maimon Cohen, a geneticist from Buffalo, NY, made an<br>
announcement that significantly prejudiced the public's view of LSD.<br>
Returning from a visit to the Haight-Ashbury area, Cohen decided to examine<br>
chromosomes from a 57 year old man who had been given LSD on four occasions<br>
during a 15 year hospitalization. The patient was found to have more<br>
chromosomal breaks than usual. Dr. Cohen also spilled LSD into a test tube<br>
containging human cells and observed damage to the chromosomes. Later it<br>
was pointed out that similar results cold be achived with the same amount<br>
of milk and that Cohen's patient had recieved regular treatments of Librium<br>
and Thorazine, now proven chromosome-breakers. Nonetheless, on the basis of<br>
his examination of the single patient and his cell-spilling experiment,<br>
Cohen published his conclusions in Science. By evening the charge that LSD<br>
could break chromosomes was in all the nation's media.<br>
<p>
Shortly thereafter, two doctors in Portland, Oregon reported that they had<br>
found an excess of choromosomal breaks in users of street acid. The chart<br>
they provided revealed that extra breakage occured only among users of acid<br>
who were also users of amphetamine, which as since been established a<br>
chromosome-breaker. Once again the papers had a field day. A full-page ad<br>
for a McCall's article on LSD featured a baby broken into parts. Ironically<br>
the article itself cast doubts on the charge of chromosomal damage.<br>
<p>
Retractions on mistaken opinions and findings about the use and effects of<br>
LSD are quiet and very rare, and so it was in regard to the chromosome<br>
charge. Even though studies conducted by the National Institute of Mental<br>
Health and others disproved the allegation, even though Timothy Leary's<br>
chromosomes were examined and showed no abnormal breakage, even though<br>
other drugs have now clearly been established to be choromosome-breakers<br>
while LSD has not, the media took little if any notice of the new<br>
evidence."<br>
