        This list has been a great help in finding and hopefully tomorrow<br>
being able to acquire my first helpings of so called "smart drugs".  Also i<br>
think that the reliabilty of these drugs really isnt in question. <br>
        For DMAE the one I choose to start on there was a simple biological<br>
explaniaton for its effects and simple biological reasons for its<br>
side-effects.  Along the line these supplements and nootropics have to be<br>
passed by the FDA for approval as OTC, supplemental, and prescription<br>
availability and they must establish necessary guidelines for dosing and<br>
prescribing and probably even establish its LD50 dosage.  so these<br>
supplements and drugs aren't totally unresearched. <br>
        as for their claimed effects to the mental process, it doesnt really<br>
matter to me. If my body can be fooled into a higher ability to concentrate,<br>
better mood and extends my life span then i dont really care if more<br>
acetlycholine has penetrated the blood-brain barrier, its not really the<br>
issue, the results are.<br>
