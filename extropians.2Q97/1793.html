     Damien Broderick wrote about Jim Penman:<br>
     <br>
     "My own weirdness indicators started flashing when I learned, <br>
     elsewhere, that Penman is an evangelical Christian who believes that <br>
     God intervenes on your behalf if you pray.  On the other hand, he's a <br>
     self-made millionaire with a franchise business, so maybe he's right <br>
     about God's help.  And on the other other hand, he claims that his <br>
     historical models are derived from refutable aggregations of data and <br>
     theory."<br>
     <br>
     My response:<br>
     <br>
     Hmmmm.  Might want to look at that.  Perhaps it's appropriate to <br>
     "believe" in God when the return on investment is viable. &lt;G&gt;<br>
     <br>
     I get occasionally tweaked by the credulity of someone who calls <br>
     themselves "born again" "evangelical" and particularly <br>
     "fundamentalist" as an adjective to describe their Christian beliefs.  <br>
     It's probably a trigger effect from being raised in the South around <br>
     all the B.S.  I finally decided that most of the people espousing <br>
     eternal life were not people I'd want to spend it with (given the <br>
     little kid perspective that "heaven" is small enough where you'd often <br>
     bump into people you didn't care for).<br>
     <br>
     That person who regularly prays, whether to God, the Universe, Mother <br>
     Earth, Buddha, who/whatever is focusing their intention which is the <br>
     first step towards bringing something tangible out of the <br>
     imagination/mind.  Many Christians don't even get this because they <br>
     are still behaving like programmed peasants of the Middle Ages (your <br>
     reward is in heaven not here, suffering is good, poverty is noble, <br>
     etc.)<br>
     <br>
     I recently read on the effect of benevolent/positive thinking/feeling <br>
     vs. malevolent/negative thinking/feeling on one's genetic structure.  <br>
     Manifesting a loving energy, exercising compassion, discernment, less <br>
     likely to judge and deride may be a determining factor in activating <br>
     more of the 64 potential DNA combinations (of which we use about 1/3) <br>
     in our genetic makeup.  The oscillating effect of higher benevolent <br>
     energy intersects our DNA more frequently and increasing the <br>
     likelihood of activating more of the currently inactive amino acid <br>
     chains.<br>
     <br>
     I'm intrigued.  <br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
