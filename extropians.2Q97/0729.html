<i>        &gt;&gt; Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;If a beam of light is polarized at 0 degrees and you set your         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;polarizer at X degrees then the number of photons in the beam will         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;be reduced by [cos(X)]^2, for 45 degrees that is 50%. For an       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;individual photon there is a 50% chance it will make it through and         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;a 50% chance it will not, if it does make it through the amplitude         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;has not been changed at all</i><br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;Steve Witham &lt;sw@tiac.net&gt;         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Just want to point out that the 50% probability of the photon getting        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;through is determined by something called a "probability amplitude,"         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;which (in this example) *is* (a complex number with an absolute value         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of) .707...</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
But the probability of the photon making it through a second polarizer set <br>
the same way as the first is 100%, the probability of it making it through a <br>
second polarizer set 90 degrees from the first is 0%. The same thing is true <br>
of a correlated photon and it doesn't matter how far away it is from me or <br>
even if the two photons were made long before I was born, somehow the photon<br>
"knew" its mate would someday interact with my polarizer and it "knew" what <br>
direction I would set it to. I'm not saying this makes any sense, but it has <br>
been confirmed experimentally.   <br>
            <br>

<p>
That is indeed a very important question because the reference point actually  <br>
determine some of the physical properties of the photon, the really weird <br>
part is that you get to decide what reference point to use yourself, even for <br>
photons made 10 billion years ago. A photon is heading toward you that you <br>
wish to measure. Pick a direction at random, any direction at all, and give <br>
it a name, "horizontal" sounds nice, draw a line perpendicular to it and give <br>
it a name too, I like  "vertical". Turn your polarizer to the horizontal <br>
position. If the photon makes it through the polarizer (and there is a 50% <br>
chance that it will) then the photon is polarized 100% in the horizontal<br>
position and always has been, even if it started it's journey from a distant <br>
galaxy to your detector ten billion years before you decided in what <br>
direction to turn it. If the photon doesn't make it through the detector then <br>
the photon was always in the vertical position. The same ridiculous situation <br>
is true for the correlated photon, even though it never came anywhere near <br>
your polarizer. Pretty weird.                <br>
