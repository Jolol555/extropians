Is this about the U.S. or the world?  If about the U.S., it might be a<br>
good time to invest abroad.  <br>
<p>
Its worth pointing out that if the value of your future wages is tied<br>
to the U.S., because of your knowledge and contacts in the U.S., and<br>
if U.S. wages correlate with U.S. stock returns, as they seem to, then<br>
diversification would argue for putting more of your money abroad,<br>
perhaps to the point of holding no U.S. investments.  <br>
<p>
See:  Baxter &amp; Jermann, "The international diversification puzzle is<br>
worse than you think", American Economic Review, March '97, p. 170.<br>
<p>
Of course if you're betting instead of investing, then you may prefer<br>
to bet on things you know best.<br>
