Perhaps they have a more evolved aesthetic sense than you. Perhaps they<br>
value the diversity of variously independently evolve intelligences more<br>
than some eventual cosmic dissolution. Given that the stars in our sky<br>
have been probably the most inspirational thing in history, taking that<br>
sight away from millions of possible intelligent races is in my opinion<br>
a huge crime, not only that, but those races caught on a planet inside a<br>
dyson sphere would eventually be baked to death, so not only does this<br>
mean the death of inspiration, but the death of innumerable<br>
intelligences. Perhaps they know of a way out of this universe for<br>
advanced races to follow to avoid the end of this one. Perhaps they<br>
value the pace of evolution races will take from matter based to energy<br>
based organisms. There are many possible answers to Fermi's Paradox that<br>
still leave open the possibility for other intelligent species.<br>
<p>
Givne that we as a race are nowhere near as rapaciously expansive as we<br>
once were, I would expect that by the time we are expanding out into the<br>
universe in large numbers, we will have achieved a rather Buddha-like<br>
peacefulness and respect for potential.<br>
