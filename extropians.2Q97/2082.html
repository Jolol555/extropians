This seems to me to be a very possible future, not one that I necessarily<br>
welcome, but I tend to view its approach with a "who care's" attitude.<br>
Obviously some people here do, and I'd be interseted to hear more on why<br>
they do.  I can deffinitely see a problem if the state is the one looking<br>
over my shoulder, but what of the hoped for voluntary societies?  I'm not<br>
terribly concerned now if people know my business, and maybe that's just<br>
naivete or my virtual lack of anything to hide, but if I'm living in a<br>
community with standards of behavior that reflect my own, namely "crimes"<br>
not comitted against property are not crimes, then I can't see why it<br>
would make much difference if people can watch me go about my "private<br>
life" at home, or elsewhere.  (pardon my long sentence, no time to <br>
revise ;-&gt;)<br>
