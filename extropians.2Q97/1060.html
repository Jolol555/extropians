I heard that animals and young humans will naturally choose a good diet. I<br>
think it was Douglas Rushkoff who told me about a study in which a<br>
young child was given unlimited candy, chocolate, sugar based foods,<br>
vegetables, fruit etc. etc.<br>
<p>
Naturally the kid choose the candy, the biscuits, the junk and sugary<br>
foods - immediate gratification. But apparently the baby got tired of<br>
eating too much crap and then spent a whole day gorgeing on broccoli and<br>
cabbage and less immediatly satisfying food. Accordingly he got a balanced<br>
diet naturally.<br>
<p>
I do not know which study which he was refering too, does anyone have any<br>
idea? Or is it an urban myth?<br>
