I have heard several on this list talk positively about Robert Anton Wilson,  <br>
I confess I've never read anything by him and always considered that a lack <br>
in my education. Recent events have made me feel less guilty about it.<br>
 <br>
Even by junk science standards the work of Immanuel Velikousky is really <br>
stupid. He says that in historic times the planet Jupiter spit out a "comet" <br>
that collided with Earth and bounced off and then, through various <br>
gravitational gymnastics, parted the Red Sea and somehow caused all the  <br>
miracles in the old testament. This "comet" then went into a circular orbit <br>
around the sun and became the planet Venus! To call this idea idiotic would <br>
be a unjust insult to all the fine self respecting idiots the world over. <br>
The late great Carl Sagan had great fun pocking holes in this ignorant theory, <br>
not that that's what made him great, it was too easy, like shooting fish in <br>
a barrel.<br>
<p>
While poking around in the Science section of my local bookstore today I ran <br>
across a misfiled book that belonged in the "new age" section next to the UFO <br>
and Bigfoot books, it was called "Carl Sagan and Immanuel Velikousky" by <br>
Charles Ginenthal. I didn't read it, but after thumbing through it for <br>
5 minutes I could see it was a revolting attack on the life of Sagan and a<br>
deification of Velikousky. On the back of the book was a blurb by Robert <br>
Anton Wilson, he said this trash was  "an excellent and erudite destruction <br>
of Saganism".  I don't want to destroy "Saganism" and reading something by <br>
Wilson has just dropped about 164 places on my "to do" list.<br>
                                                    <br>
