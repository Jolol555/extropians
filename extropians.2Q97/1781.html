John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; responded:<br>

<i>&gt; I'm sure we will have lots and lots of them, but the trouble is</i><br>
<i>&gt; unlike theories of intelligence, consciousness theories are very</i><br>
<i>&gt; easy to dream up, far, far too easy. These theories have no</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective facts they must explain so there is no limit to the number</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them you can crank out. How could we ever know which theory is</i><br>
<i>&gt; correct?</i><br>
<p>
	We'll we can't know that anyone really went to the moon<br>
either.  Maybe as soon as they left earth orbit they really<br>
disappeared.  Maybe just prerecorded information was being feed to<br>
earth.  Then a copy of them re-appeared upon return with complete<br>
memories of the experience installed even though there is no real<br>
moon.<br>
<p>
	But this is what matters.  What matters is people can go to<br>
the moon, do things like ger rocks and resources and everything else<br>
as if it really existed.  Of course, even though it isn't correct, we<br>
must take the simplest theory.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In any other area this would be sufficient proof that your theory</i><br>
<i>&gt; was correct but in this one area, for reasons I don't understand,</i><br>
<i>&gt; people demand a level of rigor not seen in any other human endeavor,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not even pure mathematics.</i><br>
<p>
	Just as we don't kneed to know absolutely that there is a moon<br>
out there, when we can do things like merge conscious spaces, eff<br>
feelings, migrate between other upload hosts, and do all this fun<br>
stuff, who cares if there is some more complex theory that explains<br>
reality.  I just want to know the simplest theory that explains<br>
everything and allows me to do all this kind of immortal stuff.  I<br>
don't care if I really didn't go to the moon as long as I will never<br>
be able to tell that I didn't.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The differences could be crucial, you really felt sad but it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; different with me,</i><br>
<p>
	While are understanding is so limited we should stick to<br>
simple sensations like the taste of salt.  I don't think I've ever had<br>
precisely the same "sad" feeling.  But eventually there must be an<br>
entire set of physics developed to describe all our spiritual, or<br>
phenomenal sensations down to the most precise possible experiential<br>
detail.  When put together in complex ways these laws will be able to<br>
perfectly predict all our feelings just as simple physical laws<br>
explain other complex physical processes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Actions are not a perfect instrument for studying consciousness but</i><br>
<i>&gt; it will just have to do because we will never find anything better.</i><br>
<p>
	We will be able to do infinitely more than simple actions.  As<br>
I said before, we will be able to eff feelings, we will be able to<br>
experience all the experiences of a sexual experience, not just half,<br>
we will be able to merge minds into a unified spiritual space and so<br>
on.  Effing isn't merely "actions" though it may not be absolute<br>
proof.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think the idea of intelligent zombies is crazy</i><br>
<p>
<p>
	No!  We have zombies today.  A color sensing computer can tell<br>
us what color something is far better than we can!  But their<br>
representation of color is nothing like the experience of red or any<br>
of the color sensations we use to represent color.<br>
<p>
1) The Genetic Code,<br>
<p>
	Yes, Any type of physical diversity or distinguishability can<br>
be used to represent abstract information.  But this still does not<br>
tell us precisely the nature of our conscious representations and what<br>
they are fundamentally like.<br>
<p>
2) Nobody has ever seen even a hint of fundamental new physics in the matter <br>
   of the brain,<br>
<p>
	That is simply because we filter all information through the<br>
abstracting filter of our senses.  We have never looked for or even<br>
had the tools to look for actual phenomenal qualities.  We know,<br>
abstractly, how an atom interacts with other matter but we have no<br>
idea what it is like to be that atom.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and all that takes is information.</i><br>
<p>
	But information is nothing unless it is represented by<br>
something physically real.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) There is no scientific reason that information processing can't</i><br>
<i>&gt;    duplicate the behavior of an intelligent person,</i><br>
<p>
	Precisely!  But just because abstract binary representations<br>
can represent color as good as our sensations can doesn't mean they<br>
are the same fundamental representations.  They are not consciously<br>
like each other though they can both simulate or represent each other<br>
in an abstract way.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4) I don't see how the essence of a person, consciousness, could be</i><br>
<i>&gt;    an unobservable characteristic, because if it was we would never</i><br>
<i>&gt;    have evolved it,</i><br>
<p>
	A red sensation is not an unobservable characteristic.  We<br>
just don't yet have the tools to eff such feelings.<br>
