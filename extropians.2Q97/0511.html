Subject: psychoceramics: Moravec's Mind Age<br>
<p>
Nikolai et al.:<br>
<p>
A couple of years ago, Moravec sent me (as the Analog book columnist) the<br>
Mind Age manuscript for timely review.  I read it, wrote the review, and<br>
when Bantam canceled the project shelved the review.  Now that you're saying<br>
the book is about to be published elsewhere, I can expect to use the review<br>
after all.  Meanwhile, FYI, here's what I had to say:<br>
<p>
        In his 1988 Mind Children (Harvard University Press), Hans Moravec<br>
sketched the future development of robots, proposed that within about 50<br>
years it would be possible to transfer human minds into computers, and<br>
speculated on the replacement of biological intelligence by machine<br>
intelligence.  To him, robots would be the creations of our minds just as<br>
our children are the creations of our bodies, and since it is our minds that<br>
make us most distinctively human, our "mind children" would be our children<br>
in the more important sense. At the same time, mind transfer would offer us<br>
true immortality.<br>
        In Mind Age: Transcendence Through Robots, Moravec tells us that<br>
"Among many nice reviews of [the earlier book] an angry few brandished words<br>
like 'horrific,' 'nightmare' and 'immoral,' and at least one was too irate<br>
to publish."  I find that curious, for to a mind steeped in science and<br>
science fiction since adolescence, Moravec's ideas are not terribly strange<br>
even if they do push the envelope of what even a visionary scientist might say.<br>
        Yet Mind Children was very much a part of a discussion of the<br>
potentials of artificial intelligence and robotics that began almost as soon<br>
as the first digital computers began chewing their bytes.  Norbert Wiener<br>
invented cybernetics to "study brainlike activity in animals and machines."<br>
And in 1950, Alan Turing proposed that if one could not tell the<br>
intellectual difference between a computer and a human conversationalist,<br>
there was no such difference. The computer would be intelligent in the only<br>
way that matters.<br>
        Since then a great deal of effort has gone into meeting the demands<br>
of the "Turing test."  So far success has been only partial, but there has<br>
been enough success to justify immense optimism in the minds of some, such<br>
as Moravec.  On the other hand, others still resist the notion that a<br>
machine, a mere thing, could ever possibly really think. After all, it's too<br>
deterministic, quantum uncertainty is obviously essential to true thought,<br>
and it<br>
couldn't possibly have a soul, a mind, emotions, a sense of beauty, a...<br>
The list of deficits is<br>
endless; it also tends to be revised every time clever programmers figure<br>
out how to give a<br>
computer a new capability.<br>
        To some extent, Mind Age: Transcendence Through Robots is a<br>
recapitulation and updating of the earlier book, reviewing the development<br>
of robots up to the point where they can take control of their own<br>
continuing improvement or evolution.  Moravec devotes considerable space to<br>
what a civilization dominated by autonomous machines must<br>
mean for human economies and does not shrink from the thought that most<br>
humans will be<br>
content to eat the lotus in idle bliss, the few adventurous souls will move<br>
into robotic bodies or cyberspace and go forth into the universe, and<br>
eventually even the robotic superminds will be made obsolete by what can<br>
only be described as an intelligent universe, a universe converted to<br>
computational apparatus and sheer mind in which all reality is virtual.<br>
        Science fiction readers, who have seen many of these ideas before,<br>
find them enchanting. Others find them terrifying, which explains some of<br>
the reactions Moravec receives, even from such scientific luminaries as<br>
Roger Penrose, who has spent a good deal of effort arguing against the idea<br>
of machine intelligence.  Moravec is too polite to call Penrose out in<br>
person, but in his last chapter, he does borrow the form of Turing's seminal<br>
1950 paper to attempt--like Turing--to lay to rest the various objections to<br>
the notion of machine intelligence.  These objections he phrases like so:<br>
machines have no souls, so cannot think; thinking machines cannot be<br>
possible, because the consequences would be too dreadful; mechanical<br>
reasoning is too limited; machines can have no inner experience to give<br>
meaning to their "thoughts" or actions; machines will never be kind, moral,<br>
joyous, perceptive, original, etc.; computers do only what we can program<br>
them to do; computers don't have nerve cells; it is not possible to specify<br>
for a machine what to do in every possible circumstance a human can<br>
encounter; computers can't have ESP (Moravec considers this a genuine<br>
nonissue but deals with it because Turing did).<br>
        Moravec is not always convincing, but I do not think it is possible<br>
to be more so.  The immense leaps in the development of robots and<br>
artificial intelligence that he discusses cannot be predicted confidently<br>
given the present infantile state of the art.  However, it is just as<br>
unreasonable for the opposition to say those leaps cannot be made.  Both<br>
sides display an almost religious adherence to their beliefs.  Certainly<br>
Moravec has faith in his dreams.  His<br>
opponents have faith in tradition. <br>
        I'm inclined to side with Moravec, and I recommend Mind Age as a<br>
stimulating, provocative treat for your own mind.<br>
<p>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Tom Easton<br>
