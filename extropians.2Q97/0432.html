I was just looking at life insurance and a thought came to me.  Would it be<br>
in the best interests of life insurance companies to pledge support of life<br>
extension?  There are numerous variables to take into account like how many<br>
people die in accidents and such things that are not related to aging.  As<br>
I am not an actuary I would not want to attempt taking all of these factors<br>
into account.  If anyone has any less data intensive ideas that might shed<br>
some light on this possibility I would love to hear them.<br>

<i>&gt; That's a rather interesting idea, but it should be able to work in the</i><br>
free<br>
<i>&gt; market as well.  Get a lot of people to pledge a certain amount of money</i><br>
<i>&gt; for significant life extension.  For twenty years I'd be willing to put</i><br>
up<br>
<i>&gt; $10,000.  Now, just get 100,000 people to do this as well and you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have a prize worth one billion.  How many immortalists are there?</i><br>
