 Dear Mark and fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
Apparently, at least one member of this select circle has not upgraded to a<br>
browser that can read HTML. In an attempt to please a possible minority of<br>
one (at least until he upgrades) I'll write in plain script.<br>
<p>
Apparently there has been a misunderstanding about my aversion to a<br>
dialogue about any form of death that involves members of our species<br>
eliminating another for whatever reason -- or rationale -- might be put<br>
forth. <br>
<p>
My aversion to argumentums academica et philisophica where it involves<br>
killing is, as you might imagine, quite personal. It probably comes from<br>
more than a few intimate experiences in which I was directly involved in<br>
various forms of death several  means.  <br>
<p>
To be as direct as possible, I find discussions of this sort repugnant. I<br>
suspect that rather being concerned with improving the human condition by<br>
education and other means, his is little more than an exercise in<br>
sublimating ones own hostilities or sexual drives by intellectualizing<br>
them.<br>
<p>
Kindly alow this dialogue to end here.<br>
<p>
Thank you,<br>
<p>
A.M. Genen  <br>
