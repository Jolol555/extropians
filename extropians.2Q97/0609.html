<i>&gt; Recently I requested from the participants of  this  list, any and all</i><br>
<i>&gt; information  available here on the net  which  members could provided </i><br>
<i>&gt; to me in assisting  in my recuperation from my recent heart attack. To</i><br>
<i>&gt; those of you who responded, Thank You, but I must admit I was surprised</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the  list’s  general indifference to my plight. I should have known</i><br>
<i>&gt; that  discourse on God, the lack of God, the existent of God, requires</i><br>
<i>&gt; the total commitment of all the available neurons of the  members of</i><br>
<i>&gt; this list.  Let me help you in your discourse, first you must have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; heart  attack,  then go to any major hospital’s  ER, and  lastly  you </i><br>
<i>&gt; must believe that death is only 5 feet behind you, and gaining with each</i><br>
<i>&gt; second that passes.  After that, you might reprogram  your discussions</i><br>
<i>&gt; concerning God. </i><br>
<p>
Why do you interpret lack of response to indifference?  I assume that<br>
most of us, like me, simply had nothing to offer you.  Recovery from<br>
heart conditions just isn't a very extropian topic (to be fair, neither<br>
is God, but I don't much bother with those discussions either), and<br>
there is no reason to suspect that anyone here has any expertise in<br>
the field, or any reason to benefit from discussing it.  You have a<br>
serious medical condition.  See a doctor.  What do you need us for?<br>
<p>
If you had asked a more specifically extropian question, like "My<br>
doctor prescribed drug X; how would that interfere with my taking of<br>
nootropics?", then we might have been of some value, but even then I<br>
suspect that most of us simply don't know, and are unwilling to guess<br>
in public.<br>
