        But what is to hold them to it?  What keeps a murderer from<br>
murdering the family of the victims in the time that he is supposedly making<br>
restitution?  I think that for violent crimes like rape, battery, assault,<br>
murder etc., the best way to take care of it is with (as Eric Watt Forste<br>
said) handcuffs and leg irons.  However, should the judgment not be wholly<br>
circumstantial?  I, personally, see that in some instances murder should not<br>
be a crime (rape and battery etc. are another story).  So the question turns<br>
from "What should be done?" into "Who gets to decide?"  I am reminded of<br>
Heinlein's "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress" in which a witness to a crime<br>
assembles some passer-bys to bring forth a judgment.  Both sides present a<br>
case, and a decision is made in a short amount of time.  This way, a person<br>
who is declared "innocent" does not have to suffer through many months of<br>
invasive incarceration as frequently happens in our legal system today.<br>
<p>
        As for the future, I would imagine that a drug would be found that<br>
could provoke the truth from a suspect.  BTW, I am all for capital<br>
punishment as long as it is based on circumstance and situation, and as long<br>
as it is implemented honestly.<br>
