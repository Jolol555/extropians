Yes.  A while back, I started a thread "Extropians Investing in the Future."<br>
The responses were quite informed.  Over the months, I have been meeting<br>
with a couple of friends to discuss stock and investments portfolios.  Since<br>
this time, I have begun taking charge of my own investments.  By using the<br>
services of a discount broker, I am more apt to pay attention to the<br>
direction of my investments,  rather than relying on brokerage firms.<br>
<p>
One aspect of taking charge of one's investments is to learn from another's<br>
mistakes.  I would gladly share some of my blunders as well as success and<br>
insights with  investments, especially real estate.<br>
<p>
If anyone is interested in furthering either local or virtual meetings,<br>
please keep me advised.<br>
<p>
Also, a delightful book to read is _The Richest Man In Babylon_.<br>
