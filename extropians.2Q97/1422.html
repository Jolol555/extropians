Their extremely fast rate of adaption might be because millions of<br>
borgs are developing countermeasures in the background. Or perhaps<br>
they are lost in "Infinite Fun Space" as the Minds in _Excession_<br>
call it? <br>

<p>
But suppose you let a few units and scout ships get attacked, and<br>
then the rest of the Collective can safely learn from the attack and<br>
figure out how to replicate it? As long as they doesn't encounter a<br>
vastly superior foe they can sacrifice a few units and learn a lot<br>
from it. <br>
