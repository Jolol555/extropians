Net censorship, access cost increase, and Intellectual Property alert!<br>
<p>
Every netizen or organization that wants low cost net access, net <br>
free speech, and uncensored e-mail has a high stake in a court <br>
case soon to be decided in the litigation war involving Scientology,<br>
the Internet, and a nonprofit electronic library and historic archive <br>
called FactNet.<br>
<p>
An emergency Internet and legal issues briefing has been prepared for <br>
you and/or your organization at (www.factnet.org).  Factnet’s Board of <br>
Directors urgently asks your help to  promote both media coverage and <br>
a vigorous dialogue among netizens on the immediate and substantial <br>
threat this briefing discloses to the future of the Internet. <br>
<p>
To help understand the importance of this briefing to Internet costs, <br>
Internet slowdowns, Internet intellectual property and Internet free <br>
speech please find the following media quotes.<br>
<p>
"If the church's (Scientology’s) lawsuits prevail...future providers <br>
of bulletin boards and newsgroups on the World Wide Web, as well as <br>
the companies running such subscriber services as Prodigy, Compuserve, <br>
and America Online might be forced to monitor or restrict information<br>
simply because they fear being sued...If system operators are liable for<br>
the content of the postings, it will lead to censorship...It would change<br>
the whole idea of how the Internet develops -- it's that important." <br>
--Shari Steele, attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, as<br>
quoted in "The Net: Copyright or 'Free Press'?" Newsday, 10/10/95<br>
<p>
"Besides the technological curtailment of free speech, a skirmish like<br>
this one has the potential to completely disrupt the online operation not<br>
only of individual users, but also of entire networks overloaded by<br>
traffic their circuits were never designed to handle."  <br>
--Colman Jones, "Freedom Flames Out on the 'Net: Who Launched the <br>
largest-ever Sabotage of the Internet?" <br>
www.now.com/issues/15/44/News/feature.html <br>
<p>
"Other [Internet] users have reported mysterious incidents: investigators<br>
 visiting their neighbors, strangers attempting to get into their telephone<br>
records, e-mail sent to their sysadmins asking that their accounts be<br>
closed down. How did we get to this, in a free country?...<br>
<p>
"It turns out that a belief in free speech and an interest in <br>
Scientology may involve you in the bitterest battle fought across <br>
the Internet to date. A fight that has burst the banks of the Net <br>
and into the real world of police,lawyers, and armed search and <br>
seizure. Ultimately, however, the drama doesn't matter: the real <br>
issues here are the boundaries of free speech and the future of <br>
copyright and intellectual property in the face of a<br>
technology that can scatter copies across the world in seconds...<br>
"Whatever the motives, when computers are seized because they<br>
contain allegedly purloined intellectual property, messages are<br>
intercepted as they traverse the network, or the security of anonymous<br>
remailers is pierced by police, the days of the Internet as a cozy,<br>
private, intellectual cocktail party are over. .." <br>
--Wendy M. Grossman, "alt.scientology.war," Wired, 8/95<br>
<p>
Lest anyone doubt Scientology's intentions, an article in the most <br>
recent issue of an internal Scientology magazine called "High Winds" <br>
proudly trumpets "groundbreaking lawsuits against both copyright <br>
infringers and the computer service companies that served as <br>
electronic conduits" for them. It goes on to predict "landmark <br>
decisions" in which, "for the first time, Internet access providers <br>
will be held responsible for any copyright infringements posted <br>
through their facilities."  <br>
<p>
"The Internet is an information age tool that empowers individuals and<br>
reduces the need for a large, authoritarian government. It empowers the<br>
poor with an unregulated world of entrepreneurial opportunity... <br>
Information and the new frontier could create a more fair, peaceful <br>
society The free flow of information is central to America's foundation, <br>
and '90s technology only enhances it. Unfortunately, it's all big threat<br>
to those in power who rely on the control of information to secure <br>
their lofty positions. No matter what they call it, free speech is the <br>
issue." --Wayne Langsen, "Raiding Free Speech," Boulder Weekly editorial. <br>

PLEASE help protect our mutual Internet freedoms by appropriately <br>
forwarding this briefing to your personal or organizational network <br>
of individuals, newsgroups, listservs, net media, and net watch <br>
organizations where it hasn’t appeared yet.<br>
<p>
Your timely attention to this critical briefing is appreciated,<br>
<p>
The Directors of Factnet<br>
Boulder Colorado USA<br>
<p>
P.S. Factnet has been reconstructing its electronic files since they <br>
were sabotaged and returned to us by court order after the Scientology <br>
raid. Our original mailing lists consisted of individuals and organizations <br>
who had viewed materials or had an interest in Scientology’s Internet <br>
abuses and other human rights abuses. Because of the raid we are not <br>
fully certain that our reconstructed mailing lists contain what they <br>
originally contained or have been reassembled back into the proper lists. <br>
These reconstructed mailing lists are far to important to the battle for <br>
Internet free speech not to begin using again just because they were in <br>
Scientology's possession.<br>
<p>
If you have received this alert and you have not previously reviewed or <br>
been interested in any information on these issues let us know and we <br>
will immediately correct the situation. We ask your understanding if <br>
there has been an error or duplicate mailing. Try to imagine someone <br>
illegally seizing all of your computers and computer files then searching <br>
and altering and destroying parts of them. Finally you get it all back <br>
to you in boxes and pieces. That's what happened to Factnet. Over the <br>
last 12 months with minimal resources it has had to reconstruct 6 <br>
gigabits of its deliberately disordered returned libraries and files.  <br>
