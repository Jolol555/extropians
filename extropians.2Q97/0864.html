<i>&gt; Once again, you are confusing copyrights and patents. However, any</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual property can be recreated by an individual for individual</i><br>
<i>&gt; use only. If the individual gains commercially in any way it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; violation of the creators property rights...</i><br>
<p>
I suggest that you start getting legal advice from real lawyers.<br>
Whether or not one makes money is /completely irrelevant/ to IP law.<br>
"Personal use" is no defense to infringement.  "Fair use" is, and there<br>
are precedents for what is and is not fair use, but whether the use is<br>
private or commercial is not a deciding factor (for example, quoting<br>
a small piece of a copyrighted work for review is fair use--whether or<br>
not the review is done for profit).  Patents and copyrights are the<br>
same in this regard.  Building a patented device in your garage for<br>
your own private use /is/ infringement.<br>
<p>
Note that I am describing the current state of US law as of 1997.  I<br>
make no arguments here as to whether or not such laws are just, or to<br>
the state of any foreign laws.  The archives here have much discussion<br>
on the propriety of these laws; I suggest you find a more reliable source<br>
for information on their present state.<br>
