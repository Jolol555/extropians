<p>
I have the impression that many NDEs are rather extreme brain-states, the <br>
brain is very active and far from the normal attractors. When the neurons <br>
start getting into trouble due to ischemia, hypoxia or poisons they don't <br>
go quietly, they start firing and releasing neurotransmittors like mad; I <br>
have seen some microdialysis curves from dying brains, and they are a <br>
chemical circus (interesting enough they suggests that glutamate may not <br>
be the main culprit of brain death, or that it is just a local factor). <br>
So there is definitely enough noise in such states to trigger interesting <br>
experiences (especially if the temporal lobe is involved).<br>
<p>
OOBE's are different, at least in the beginning "looking down on my body" <br>
stage (after that they can move towards the NDE stage). My personal theory<br>
is that they are a form of dissociative reaction that we subconsciously<br>
create to avoid pain or confusion, a kind of temporary MPD where the ego<br>
is cut loose from the rest of the mind which is very busy.  They can be<br>
triggered through training and suggestion, although I suspect that there<br>
is no firm border between them and hypnosis, visualisation and (lucid)<br>
dreaming. A wild guess would be that they involve the parietal lobe. <br>
