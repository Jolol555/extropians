<i>&gt;&gt;As we become better at exchanging information in ways other than via</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sexual reproduction, it seems the longer time-horizon of asexual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;reproduction should win out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If we skip details about *how* genes (that is, the information that</i><br>
<i>&gt;is used to produce an offspring) get from here to there, the distinction</i><br>
<i>&gt;between asexual and sexual reproduction boils down to *where* the</i><br>
<i>&gt;information comes from.  Does it all descend from the information that</i><br>
<i>&gt;originally went into the parent, with no other input, *or does it come</i><br>
<i>&gt;from more than one source*?  If the latter, that's sex in my book.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Robin, you are clearly using a different definition of "sexual </i><br>
<i>&gt;reproduction" since you are talking about different ways of</i><br>
<i>&gt;exchanging information (the essence of sex as I see it)--what is your</i><br>
<i>&gt;distinction and why is it interesting? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, your definition of "sexual" is vastly more liberal than mine.<br>
My use of the term comes from precise mathematical models of evolution<br>
of genes, while your use seems more metaphorical.   The interest in<br>
these precise models comes, as usual, from the fact that one can work<br>
out concrete conclusions from them.<br>
<p>
Let me suggest that it is useful to distinguish the evolution of<br>
values from the evolution of "facts", or beliefs about facts.  The<br>
space of possible basic values is much smaller than the space of<br>
possible fact beliefs; so I think it is plausible to think in terms of<br>
an evolutionary equilibrium of values even when fact discovery is<br>
still going strong.  I started this discussion citing papers on basic<br>
value evolution, and my conclusions are mainly regarding that: asexual<br>
reproduction of values has strong advantages when investment matters.<br>
<p>
Reproduction/dissemination/etc. of facts/beliefs is another matter.<br>
Here I agree that organisms will not want to limit themselves to<br>
beliefs inherited from a single parent, and while inheriting beliefs<br>
from two parents is better, humans and their descendants can do much<br>
better than this.  Here I find it more valuable to look at genetic<br>
selection of general policies for evaluating and sharing beliefs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;1) Until recently, organisms have had very little occasion to make</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;long-term investments other than children.  So the investment benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of asexual reproduction has been moot.  But now humans do have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;choose between "consuming" their own ability to have more children</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;now, and investing toward their children's ability to have more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;children later.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think this just means, reproduce now (with current methods) vs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;invest, then reproduce more wisely later?  The sexual/asexual question</i><br>
<i>&gt;seems independent here, even with your definition.  For instance, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;could become rich and marry a carefully selected mate who was</i><br>
<i>&gt;capable of bearing large litters, and fund the raising of all these</i><br>
<i>&gt;kids.</i><br>
<p>
Yes you could, but the question is whether you would.  Sexual vs.<br>
asexual models have differing implications regarding selection of such<br>
investment policies.<br>
