Mark Grant said my argument about the genetic basis of senescence<br>
sounds circular, but then presents "Dawkins' explanation", which<br>
Dawkins himself credits to Sir Peter Medawar, G. C. Williams, and<br>
W. D. Hamilton. This is exactly the explanation that I was trying<br>
to present, but I guess I did a poor job of it.<br>
<p>
Rather than repeat my mistakes, I'll give a bibliographic cite to<br>
a widely available book (by Dawkins), written at a popular level:<br>
RIVER OUT OF EDEN, ISBN 0-465-01606-5, pp 128-133. Interestingly<br>
enough, Dawkins chooses to present this explanation at the end of<br>
the last chapter of the book.<br>
