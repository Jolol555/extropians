Carl Feynman wrote 6/16/97: &lt;Here's a cyclical theory that is suffciently=<br>
<p>
precise to be disproved: the rate of growth of the French population has<br>
oscillated from psotive to negative with a 47-year period since the twelf=<br>
th<br>
century.  I just made this theory up, and it's probably false.  But it's<br>
hardly vacuous.&gt;<br>
<p>
Who cares if it can be disproven?  Can it be proven?  That is, what will<br>
really happen next?  Why start in the twelth century?  Will the<br>
twenty-first century be exactly like the twelfth through twentieth<br>
centuries, or will it be like the centuries before the twelfth, or will i=<br>
t<br>
be novel?  What does such a theory say about the causal factors?  Will<br>
these causal factors continue to be present in the future?  A theory abse=<br>
nt<br>
the actual causal factors is, for epistemological purposes,<br>
indistinguishable from magical incantations.<br>
<p>
Carl's analogy: &lt;But geography is continuous, one kilometer after another=<br>
,<br>
no one kilometer any different than any other kilometer, every kilometer =<br>
of<br>
equal length.  No kilometer is to be given a privileged position when<br>
starting a cyclical analysis.  There is no "basin/range alternation"<br>
identifiable anywhere except in relation to yourself and yourself alone. =<br>
<p>
To arbitrarily assert otherwise is to commit a category error in analysis=<br>
=2E&gt;<br>
<p>
Personally, I try to avoid making spatial analogies of temporal events. =<br>
<p>
Space and time are essentially separate concepts and crossover analogies<br>
generally don't work very well.  Geography is essentially fixed in time,<br>
very discrete when it is used in historical studies.  You can find "Franc=<br>
e"<br>
on a map, you can't find a "French generation" anywhere.  Perhaps geology=<br>
<p>
would be a better analogy, but then it falls apart, because where do you<br>
start in geology looking for historical cycles?  Even if you can find<br>
geological cycles, geologists tend not to bother about rocks' properties =<br>
of<br>
intentionality, creativity, free will and the like, such as humans who ma=<br>
ke<br>
history are endowed with.  The idea of human creativity being historicall=<br>
y<br>
cyclical is a self-refuting concept.<br>
<p>
Carl: &lt;A generation is a theoretical concept used by people who try to<br>
explain<br>
history.    I don't see why it's a category error to construct such a<br>
concept, and then argue that it provides a correct theory.  What two<br>
categories are you claiming to have been confused in this case?&gt;<br>
<p>
There's nothing wrong with the concept of a generation, since it's been<br>
around since at least the first set of siblings.  But when you try to<br>
explain history, errors creep in because picking what year any given<br>
generation starts is utterly arbitrary, unless you are discussing one<br>
single family, in which case you can be fairly specific.  This is what<br>
Damien Sullivan is getting at when he says "belief in historical cycles m=<br>
ay<br>
derive from apparent local patterns."  The local pattern is always yourse=<br>
lf<br>
and your family, but as you spread out from there, across cultures and<br>
geography to encompass the whole world, any explanatory power of past<br>
events or prediction abilities for future events become diluted to<br>
insignificance.  I am in no way denigrating the proven ability of<br>
demographics to predict certain local tendencies, but demographics used t=<br>
o<br>
forecast world historical events using some variety of recurrent cycles i=<br>
s<br>
exceptionally dicey.<br>
