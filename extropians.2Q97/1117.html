In response to Erik Moeller's statements:<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;The wall in Germany fell because of massive media propaganda. Kohl </i><br>
<i> &gt;himself admitted this afterwards and said it would not have been</i><br>
<i> &gt;possible without western media. Of course hundreds of thousands of</i><br>
<i> &gt;unemployed people in East Germany would prefer socialism now.</i><br>
<p>
These people had a sudden change of government.  Give it time, and eventually<br>
the economy will grow.  People who were raised for decades with "guaranteed<br>
jobs and food" are going to have to adapt to capitalism.  I think the world<br>
economies speak for themselves.  The real bottom line is a matter of rights -<br>
Who's right is it to tell anyone else how to live?  The answer is - noone's.<br>
 Having any form on government is ludicrous, especially a communist one.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;A good economy is not only characterized by its growth or size, but also</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the distribution of wealth and the inequality. That's what</i><br>
<i>&gt;Libertarians always forget. And that's why people like you might mean</i><br>
<i>&gt;the end of this planet.</i><br>
<p>
Who cares if there is an unequal distribution of wealth.  Show me a large<br>
group of people in which all people are equal in intelligence, creativity,<br>
knowlege, experiance, and strength, and then I may agree with you.  People<br>
are different, and will always have different amounts of money.  If you wish<br>
to become a billionaire, shall we tell you that you can't because most people<br>
aren't?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I can't remember any politician who said that war is a good thing. Most</i><br>
<i>&gt;of them just said it was necessary. Words are just words, and deeds are</i><br>
<i>&gt;deeds. The US aggression against Vietnam and other communist countries</i><br>
<i>&gt;was simply wrong (although a war can never be justified).</i><br>
<p>
Thieves are the lower scum, while politicians are the higher scum.  They are<br>
still scum.  Without governments, war cannot happen.  Case solved.  (I know<br>
getting to that point will take a while, to say the least.  I'm just talking<br>
pure theory, to be applied over the next few centuries, until we're there at<br>
a pure state of anarcho-capitalism.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; And the media in the US aren't owned by gov't. Why do they support</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe they have this weird idea that its better to be in a free</i><br>
<i>&gt; country where they can print what they like?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&lt;very big evil grin&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe you should ask the guys at a-albionic research how free western</i><br>
<i>&gt;media are.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not familiar with a-albionic, but I do agree with you that the media<br>
isn't free to print just anything.  They are very regulated.  Try to put<br>
Extropian ideas sincerely reviewed on the first 5 pages of the LA Times.<br>
 Good luck.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;With 15 % poor people, low education standard, a rich power elite,</i><br>
<i>&gt;propaganda by TV religions and enterprise advertising, growing</i><br>
<i>&gt;inequality and a hardly existant welfare system, the US are one of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;saddest examples for free markets ins world history and will remind</i><br>
<i>&gt;anyone with a little bit of brain capacity of the Middle </i><br>
<i>&gt;Ages.</i><br>
<p>
I agree completely, but let's look at CAUSE.  The cause of these problems is<br>
not capitalism.  The cause is too much communism (PUBLIC schools, TAXES to<br>
have PUBLIC SERVICES, etc.).  America is no ideal place to live, I agree.<br>
 Just be sure to analyse the cause of its demise.<br>
