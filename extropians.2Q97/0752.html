To which ard saw fit to reply sarcastically:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;	Huh?  Could you please repeat that?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
With the result that the whole list was treated to<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I SAID</i><br>
<i>&gt;LEAVE ME ALONE  LEAVE ME ALONELEAVE ME ALONE  LEAVE ME ALONELEAVE ME ALONE</i><br>
<i>&gt;...</i><br>
for his trouble.<br>
<p>
This is an excellent example of why I almost never use sarcasm.  I've<br>
virtually never seen it work as well as honesty, especially on people who<br>
are already pissed off.  In cases such as this one, either ignoring the<br>
emotional outburst, or posting (or better yet emailing privately) a message<br>
such as "Please don't spam the readers for the sins of the writers.", or<br>
even posting to the list a genuine expression of frustration that people<br>
make such outbursts in public, would likely have been preferable.<br>
<p>
There is little or nothing to be gained by venting frustration or annoyance<br>
with such barbs (people have been shot for even less; fortunately that's<br>
unlikely here).  I'm not sure there's much to be gained from my posting<br>
this message, either, but I feel like I have to try because I'd rather<br>
live in a world where people didn't resort to such heavyhanded (in the<br>
one case) or backhanded (in the other) rhetorical devices.  I can only<br>
hope that because I wrote this, one or more people will think twice, go<br>
get a drink of water or whatever, and decide to make a more constructive<br>
post than they otherwise would the next time they are provoked or upset.<br>
<p>
Now off to go do what people pay me for, which somehow doesn't seem as<br>
important as this....<br>
