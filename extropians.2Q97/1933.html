It's quite unsavory indeed.<br>
<p>
An estate tax is levied on a person's right to transmit property. The<br>
rationale seems to be that government protects this right with its laws,<br>
and maintains also the infrastructure which facilitates it (probate<br>
court, public records, etc.) This would perhaps warrant (according to<br>
TINSTAAFL) a surcharge on the transaction itself regardless of the<br>
amount being transmitted. Certainly not a percentage tax on the property<br>
itself (unless it varied in accordance with the complexity of the<br>
transaction.) Regardless, most probate courts do charge a small fee and<br>
the other transactional costs are borne entirely by the decedent's<br>
estate or the inheritor's wallet. It's usury plain and simple. <br>
