Rethinking the Welfare State -- A New CEPR Network<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.econ.bbk.ac.uk/welfaresociety">http://www.econ.bbk.ac.uk/welfaresociety</a><br>
<p>
Rethinking the Welfare Society is a new CEPR network which will analyze the<br>
provision and finance of social insurance, lifecycle transfers,<br>
redistribution,<br>
and welfare services -  such as health care, education, and training - in<br>
advanced market economies. The network seeks to address the challenge of<br>
exploring how the above activities are to be divided between the government,<br>
business enterprises, households, and other economic and political<br>
institutions. Since the government is viewed as just one source of welfare<br>
activities, the network deals with the "welfare society" rather than just the<br>
"welfare state." The network is concerned not only with the sources of<br>
welfare<br>
problems - such as poverty, social exclusion, unemployment, and economic<br>
insecurity - but also with strategies for reforming the incentives and<br>
institutions associated with welfare activities.<br>
<p>
We encourage you to join our mailing list which you can do at our website. We<br>
will use this to provide news of upcoming conferences and activities as well<br>
as<br>
for research news. If you are a specialist in one of the areas covered by the<br>
network, you are also encouraged to enter your name in our directory of<br>
specialists <a href="http://www.econ.bbk.ac.uk/wsndir">http://www.econ.bbk.ac.uk/wsndir</a>. This can also be done at our<br>
website<br>
<a href="http://www.econ.bbk.ac.uk/welfaresociety">http://www.econ.bbk.ac.uk/welfaresociety</a>. The searchable directory is<br>
intended<br>
as a compendium of information of researchers working in the area. We<br>
particularly welcome your ideas on how to foster on-line communication,<br>
networking in this area.<br>
<p>
We look forward to your contributions.<br>
