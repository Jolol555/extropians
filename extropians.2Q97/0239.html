I asked: <br>
<i>&gt;  Are you claiming that these are not in fact long shots, or that one</i><br>
<i>&gt;  should hide such facts from children for fear of discouraging them?  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have no problem with people taking long shots, if they know that's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  what they are doing.</i><br>
<p>
GeoffCobb@aol.com answered:<br>
<i>&gt;You missed my point. Are we talking statistics or are we discussing</i><br>
<i>&gt;how I am to raise my child?  Perhaps pursuit of a glorious career is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;long shot for someone , who has not the talent or perserverence.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;seem to claim it is a long shot for ANYONE to become a movie star.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;must point out, that for those who are already there, this a natural</i><br>
<i>&gt;state.  I know a two "movie stars". ( No astronauts sorry). They are</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply people who put one foot in front of the other every day, like</i><br>
<i>&gt;you and I, but aimed in a certain direction</i><br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey also responded:<br>
<i>&gt;With respect to personal achievement, Robin, you should know that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;chances one has of making it to the goal are mostly affected by</i><br>
<i>&gt;preparation and perseverance. While going for it may be a long shot for</i><br>
<i>&gt;those who only try, those who follow Yoda and live by "There is no try,</i><br>
<i>&gt;do or do not." have good chances. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, of course one should condition estimates of career chances on<br>
estimates of talent and willingness to persist relative to others.<br>
But even conditioning on these, there are many people for whom many<br>
careers are "long shots".  I know very persistent people who tried and<br>
failed to become movie stars.<br>
<p>
Moving back to the topic of sex roles, I would claim that current sex<br>
roles make many goals "long shots" for most males.  To my previous list:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;a son who would like to be a fulltime house-husband, or who is hoping</i><br>
<i>&gt;he'll never have to deal with violence from bullies at school, or who</i><br>
<i>&gt;is hoping to deal with his shyness by waiting for girls to ask him out</i><br>
<i>&gt;socially. </i><br>
<p>
I would add fathers who hope to gain custody of their children in a<br>
divorce.  The responses above sound like the standard response to male<br>
complaints: "If you were a real man, you'd try harder and succeed."<br>
