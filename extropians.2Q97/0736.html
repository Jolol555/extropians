<i>&gt;&gt; Sometimes art can be quite subtle. One of my favorite "artworks" was when</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Condition" a few years back: he stole two benches from the exhibition hall</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and sold them.  In the ensuing uproar he got quite many swedes to argue</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; big question is IMHO if his theft was the artwork, or the ensuing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; controversy which he had clearly anticipated. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I wonder if one could extend this form of ideas of provoking thinking to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; other areas, such as science. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A Warhol original is something touched and manipulated by Mr. A Warhol</i><br>

<i>&gt;they could own a Warhol original. A squiggle on a can of tomato soup was</i><br>
<i>&gt;worth thousands of dollars overnight..... why? .... because the High</i><br>
<i>&gt;Priests of art, the critics of the time, said that anything that Andy</i><br>
<i>&gt;touched was gold dust.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Warhol was a magician who created a currency and laughed all the way to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the bank</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would like to ask, 'what is the differnce between this artist sorcerer</i><br>
<i>&gt;and any scientist who has a particular 'theory'?'</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Surely both are playing the currency game and neither represent any</i><br>
<i>&gt;objetive truth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
In the one case, the 'cognoscenti' collude with Warhol, and the value<br>
could be totally a human creation (although some of the cognoscenti<br>
might claim to see something objectively valuable, some 'statement'<br>
perhaps, in Warhol's magic trick); in the other case, nature 'colludes<br>
with the scientists - or rather, it either colludes or it doesn't.<br>
