Eric Moeller and Perry Metzger continue their discussion:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I bet the wall fell in East Germany because of those darn trained</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "outside agitators" too, just like with the student protests in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; '60s in the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The wall in Germany fell because of massive media propaganda. Kohl</i><br>
<i>&gt;himself admitted this afterwards and said it would not have been</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible without western media. Of course hundreds of thousands of</i><br>
<i>&gt;unemployed people in East Germany would prefer socialism now.</i><br>
<p>
The problems in Eastern Germany and other recently communist countries is <br>
a legacy of COMMUNISM, not capitalism. I don't understand why people <br>
can't get this. Look, people under the rule of a communist regime have it <br>
beaten into them for their entire lives that they are dependant upon the <br>
state. And since communist states control every aspect of the economy, <br>
they pretty much enforce a situation in which all their citizens must <br>
turn to the state for all their needs. These poor people have had most of <br>
their personal initiative driven by a systematized destruction of their <br>
individuality.<br>
<p>
Is it any surprise, then, that the economies of these countries would <br>
suffer? The system of capitalism provides no over-arching power <br>
structures to tell people what to do. Productive companies are the result <br>
of people having ideas and goals and accomplishing them to benefit <br>
themselves. The communists chased these ideas of selfishness and personal <br>
initiative out of their citizens by force and propaganda. All production <br>
of essential goods and services was regulated by the state. Any property <br>
of any value whatsoever (like all apartment buildings, factories, etc.) <br>
was owned by the state. The state set all production and consumtion rates <br>
- again by force and propaganda. Personal initiative was rewarded by the <br>
nationalization of productive companies.<br>
<p>
Capitalism is a very complex idea that we take for granted. Ideas don't <br>
just spring fully developed into the minds of people. Freedom, and the <br>
attitudes and ideals that the state of freedom brings also just do not <br>
materialize into people's heads. The ideas the one can work to benefit <br>
oneself, that in individual has the right to the fruits of his labor, and <br>
that the state is there to protect the people against force and fraud - <br>
these have to be taught. The citizens of formerly communist countries <br>
have to learn. It will take time.<br>
 <br>
It is unbelievable to me that anyone is still advocating variants of <br>
socialism. If one is interested in the results of socialist systems, one <br>
need merely look at history - it's one grand controlled experiment. Let's <br>
start now, and work our way backwards. Look at the socialist experiments <br>
of most of the European contries - they are crumling. The medical, <br>
welfare, and worker's benefits packages are strangling most of the bugets <br>
of these countries. Most European countries are rapidly privatizing many <br>
functions formerly performed by the public sectore.<br>
<p>
Fidel Castro has reluctantly allowed the creation of 'free enterprise <br>
zones' in many areas of Cuba to help lower unemployment. Hmmmm.... Seems <br>
like capitalism is OK if it generates wealth that the communist <br>
goverments can then steal.<br>
<p>
OK - now back a bit further. Remember Pol Pot and Ieng Sary? They both <br>
ran a controlled experiment. They wanted to see what happened if they <br>
forced a system of agrarian Maoism upon the people of Cambodia. They did <br>
it in a matter of months. What happened? Within weeks, upwards of 30% of <br>
the people in the experiment were dead from torture, disease, starvation, <br>
and exhaustion from forced labor. Ooops - looks like the controlled <br>
distribution of food farmed at the point of a gun doesn't work very well! <br>
 (The Cambodian Genocide project at <a href="http://www-cgp.silas.unsw.edu.au/">http://www-cgp.silas.unsw.edu.au/</a> is <br>
doing a thourough of cataloging the atrocities of and the reasons for <br>
this experiement).<br>
<p>
I could go on. Perry has talked about the interesting North-South Korean <br>
experiement that was begun several years ago. It's now showing very <br>
predicatable results. And China - I don't buy anything made in China <br>
beacuse chances are 50/50 that it was produced in a forced labor camp. <br>
Just look at history, Eric. It's one grand social experiment.<br>
