Personally I think this is the logical step, although I would not<br>
call it a "lighter energy form" (that term in my opinion reeks of<br>
cheap new age). I think information is the future. Information is of<br>
course always implemented in matter or energy, but the point is that<br>
it can be abstracted and copied into new matrices (this shows me to<br>
be a believer in the Strong AI Hypothesis); information is the<br>
"light energy" which can be easily transferred, stored, mutated and<br>
evolved. <br>

As somebody put it: "the best way of not making a mind is not to give<br>
it a body". We need to be embodied in some sense to have experiences,<br>
to be able to grow. Of course, this embodiment may be quite different<br>
from our current form (digital signals in a computer, quantum<br>
fluctuations, cards in Searle's chinese room). <br>
<p>
I think it is very useful to experience "being" different kinds of<br>
systems, although I don't see how you could experience being a<br>
thundercloud. Maybe you could map its dynamics into your sensory<br>
input, possibly even emotional signals?<br>

<i>&gt;      billion years) a blooming and fertile universe?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think anybody here disputes this view much. What may be more<br>
interesting to discuss is how to practically make this transition.<br>
