Rick Knight and Anders Sandberg:<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; It does occur for me that amongst the many contributors to this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; list, there is a preference for those things most proveable,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; tangible and material rather than anything etherial, supposed, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; otherwise imagined.  I think there is validity in both arenas and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; one should be neither entirely material and pragmatic or lost in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; the clouds and a naive nudnick for any slick story/meaning of life</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; that comes along.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I agree with you. But one has to play on the safe side, especially</i><br>
<i>&gt;  when dealing with subjects which have a huge potential for flakiness</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (uploading, nanotechnology, transcending the human condition, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  singularity, life extension etc). There is mountains of imagined,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  supposed and ethereal stuff out there, but very little practically</i><br>
<i>&gt;  useful stuff in the areas this list deals with. So we need to keep an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  eye on what can and cannot be done, and avoid being swept away by our</i><br>
<i>&gt;  hopes. </i><br>
<p>
Clearly, it depends on what it is one wants to achieve! Mountains of<br>
imagination, unproved suppositions and dreamy etherial musings may not help<br>
you when the cargo door is stuck, but  - they make for wonderful music, VR<br>
worlds and new recipes for visual confections... even for a better day...<br>
<p>
Anders, you are not so disarmingly critical as many of our male list members,<br>
but Anders, you are also an artist, as I am, and the realm of play and<br>
creativity is COMFORTABLE to us...  not so for many of our more critical,<br>
high focus friends...<br>
<p>
I understand the concern above.<br>
 For myself ... it leaves me feeling that I am being told I have nothing to<br>
contribute to "extroping"...unless I can "prove" a  value to art and<br>
creativity, in some objective way. Bluntly ignored by many, or subjected to<br>
dogmatic stodginess of our more technical list members- who critically  ( oh<br>
yes, critical thinking is a gift in itself, and I aspire to it) react when<br>
our thoughts turn from technical data and mathmatical theorum to<br>
brainstorming futuristic delights of imagination, artstuff and mind... it<br>
makes me fear for a dreary grey matter world...<br>
<p>
I scoff heartily at most so called spiritual people, and find New Age<br>
downright dangerous...because it is one thing to imagine and muse on things<br>
we know aren't real, in hopes of awakening new ideas... and another :<br>
stubbornly pretending the imagined is real... <br>

[everyone knows De Bono's Lateral Thinking, or a great new book: The Muse in<br>
the Machine (Gerlenter MIT), which talks about low focus thought as a<br>
valuable tool....<br>
Carl Sagan's Demon Haunted World also gives good insights]<br>
