<i>&gt; I really don't see that.  I simply them both as completely disjoint</i><br>
<i>&gt;  capabilities--among hundreds of different things the mind is capable</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of, none of which bears any relation to any other, and that are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;  on any "scale". </i><br>
<p>
Thanks Lee... again a great post.<br>
This, to me is like saying brain and mind are different. Thoughts, all of<br>
them, are a part of mind. I do not mean to say that they all come from the<br>
same PART of the mind. When you daydream, you are using the same mind that<br>
uses logic, you are merely using it for a different thing. If you have<br>
trained that mind to logic, it will respond better in those areas. <br>
<p>
I was not thinking in terms of inherent  thought "capabilities", because I am<br>
convinced that, unlike our present physical limits,  we have a LOT of control<br>
of our thoughts, and can choose our thoughts. Also that we can train them.<br>
I would choose 'thought skills', and give the owner his/her free will in the<br>
matter.<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;As you say, some people are better at or more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  comfortable with certain mental talents, just as some people are</i><br>
<i>&gt;  better at specific physical skills.</i><br>
<p>
I think that is a bit different, yet still I prefer skill to talent, which<br>
implies that we were born with it, rather than developed it.  think the<br>
discomfort I used to feel in logical, numb, pure focus thought was due to<br>
lack of using it, not a capability I lacked...<br>
If there is a physiological predisposition toward rational thought, it has<br>
not ever come to my attention. I have heard rumblings that women lack the<br>
logical skills of mathematics, but have not wanted to let that stop me from<br>
trying...<br>
<p>
<p>
  I think it is good that you<br>
<i>&gt;  encourage people to develop all of those abilities.   But when you</i><br>
<i>&gt;  explicitly compare two of them and place them on a scale, you make</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the mistake of implying that they interfere somehow. </i><br>
<p>
I see, and I will think about that. You have a point. Conversely  I have<br>
become convinced that this perceived "sliding scale" model frees one to more<br>
creative thoughts ( To visualize this: compare it to the slide from the<br>
dreamlike highly illogical state of sleep, into the clear alert morning<br>
thoughts of scheduling, and back to musing, say in a shower, to the creative<br>
"AHAA" state, where a sudden burst of inspiration hits you) you strengthen<br>
those skills... whereas seeing them as different and separate,  keeps one<br>
thinking you are good at ONE and not the other. Where they may just be<br>
different functions of the same thing....<br>
<p>
Anyway, if you want to reply, do so off list,  I am going to go away again -<br>
clearly I am better at images and avatars than at words about art or muses~<br>
apaolgies to any who i offended<br>
Love and Rockets, <br>
