<i>&gt; I merely seek to point out that *both* have their own role to play in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; creative act, IN FACT, neither one is separate from the other - it is more of</i><br>
<i>&gt; a sliding scale, with logic and critical/rational linear thought on one end,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and dreaming/emotional/imagination based thought on the other...</i><br>
<p>
I really don't see that.  I simply them both as completely disjoint<br>
capabilities--among hundreds of different things the mind is capable<br>
of, none of which bears any relation to any other, and that are not<br>
on any "scale".  As you say, some people are better at or more<br>
comfortable with certain mental talents, just as some people are<br>
better at specific physical skills.  I think it is good that you<br>
encourage people to develop all of those abilities.   But when you<br>
explicitly compare two of them and place them on a scale, you make<br>
the mistake of implying that they interfere somehow. <br>
<p>
I do not learn to juggle at the expense of learning to shoot a<br>
basketball (though it might appear that way considering my talents<br>
in those areas :).  Each is completely individual, as are the<br>
talents of rational thought and creative imagination.  They have<br>
nothing to do with each other, and discussing them together and<br>
calling them a continuum of sorts just feeds our prejudices that<br>
they are somehow at odds, and that perception can cause genuine<br>
harm by perpetuating stereotypes like "artist" and "nerd" based<br>
on that mistake.<br>
<p>
Perhaps I am deficient in non-logical talents; if so, I might learn<br>
from the musings of other creative minds who are not, but I don't<br>
plan on abandoning those rational facilities I do have, and I will<br>
vigorously defend their value.  Sorry if I occasionally catch an<br>
artist in the crossfire.<br>
