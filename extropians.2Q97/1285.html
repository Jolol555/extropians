<i>&gt;&gt; My returns are almost always significantly above the market.  To date I</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You take a five month return as being the least bit significant? Take</i><br>

<i>&gt;mentioning.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Except that I got an 86% return last year and 113% the year before.<br>
My returns so far this year are slightly higher than I expected, but still<br>
more or less in line with my usual return rate.  You are right, there is no<br>
significance in 5 months worth of performance.  But I have been trading a<br>
lot longer than 5 months.  <br>
<p>

<i>&gt;to save and invest with a reasonable degree of confidence. Earning 50%</i><br>
<i>&gt;a year is nice if you can manage it, but there is nothing wrong --</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing wrong -- with earning a "mere" 12%. 12% will turn even a</i><br>
<i>&gt;modest savings rate into a spectacularly comfortable retirement. I see</i><br>

<p>
<p>
I don't "make fun" of 10-12% returns.  For most people it is adequate,<br>
especially if you don't want the hassle of watching your investments.<br>
However, I don't agree with investing in index funds to get that 10-12%,<br>
for reasons already stated.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also see no embarassment in a decision like Max made to buy Coca</i><br>
<i>&gt;Cola. If it gets him a nice return over the long run, thats fine. If</i><br>
<i>&gt;it doesn't do that spectacularly, thats fine too. THAT Max is</i><br>
<i>&gt;investing is almost more important than in what -- provided we aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt;talking about really stupid investments like savings bonds.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
There never was any embarassment in buying Coca Cola.  It is a proven<br>
performer and a very safe investment for the long term.<br>
<p>
<p>
I am not saying that active investing is for everyone.  It costs time and<br>
promotes headaches.  But if you are willing to take the time and put forth<br>
the effort, the returns can be substantially and consistently higher.<br>
