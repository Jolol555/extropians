Data: pollution, poverty, and crime are found in the same areas.<br>
<p>
Old idea: poverty caused crime.<br>
Discovery: pollution is there too.<br>
New idea: pollution causes crime.<br>
Missing: what causes the poverty?<br>
Possible extension: the crime!  Or the brain damage from the pollution.<br>
<p>
Extension of old idea: poverty causes crime.  Poverty also "causes"<br>
pollution, in that the rich make sure pollution says away from them, so<br>
it ends up being dumped on the poor.  (Not because anyone hates the<br>
poor, but because no one cares.)  So crime and pollution are correlated,<br>
but separately traceable to pre-existing poverty.<br>
<p>
Proposal for observational discrimination: compare pollution and crime<br>
rates of American inner cities to Eastern bloc cities.  South-central LA<br>
to downtown Prague.  My hypothesis is that one will find more pollution<br>
in Prague but less crime (obviously to be serious you'd compare many<br>
cities, or the average of each set.)  My general prediction is that<br>
if typical pollution does increase crime it is at best a high-order[1]<br>
effect, and should not distract from the lower-order effects such as<br>
poverty and lack of education.<br>
<p>
[1] I'm using low-order to mean significant, high-order insignificant,<br>
from the terminology of infinite series where you hope the first term is<br>
dominant and that later terms slink off to zero.  Is that the meaning<br>
people think of, or do people, or lay people, assumie "high-order" means<br>
more important than "low-order"?<br>

"The problem with Danny was that he felt the entire human race was so<br>
peculiar that no single peculiarity, unless it was harmful, made any<br>
more impression on him than any other.  He knew, mostly from painful<br>
experience, that other people had different reactions, and he could make<br>
you feel like a creep or a bigot in ten seconds." -- Pamela Dean,_Tam Lin_<br>
