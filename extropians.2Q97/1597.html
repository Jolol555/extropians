&lt;I'm not so sure that this [renouncing the illusion of separateness]<br>
is incorrect. If we're right that the human brain can be uploaded to a<br>
computer, then what we see as consciousness is merely a state in the<br>
machine; an emergent property of the network. If we don't have souls<br>
then in some sense all consciousness *is* linked because it's all the<br>
same process.&gt;<br>
<p>
"In some sense", yes.  But I think, like you say, it’s an emergent<br>
process; IOW: "Out of many, One".<br>

<p>
Like I quoted from Peat in the first post: "the animating power of the<br>
world arises within movement of dualities."  And I think it was<br>
Gregory Bateson who said: "it takes two somethings to make a<br>
difference."  So, I prefer trinities (the Hegelian type, not the<br>
Christian type ;-) to simple dualisms (see Rucker’s _Mind Tools_), as<br>
in there being three levels to reality: content, context and contest,<br>
each of which is distinct from, but relies on, the others.  Put<br>
another way, we have agents, environments and interactions (contests<br>
between them); and, you can’t have any one of these pieces without the<br>
other.  So, everything is certainly linked as Mark says; but, that<br>
doesn’t mean it’s not necessary to distinguish between them.<br>
<p>
Funny, I was just reading Mark Miller &amp; Eric Drexler’s (1988) "Markets<br>
and Computation: Agoric Open Systems"<br>
(<a href="http://www.agorics.com/agorics/agoricsPapers/aos/AOS0.html">http://www.agorics.com/agorics/agoricsPapers/aos/AOS0.html</a>) this<br>
morning, and what they say about objects seems relevant to the point<br>
I’m trying to make: <br>
<p>
&lt;Encapsulation of information ensures that one object cannot directly<br>
read or tamper with the contents of another; communication enables<br>
objects to exchange information by mutual consent. The encapsulation<br>
and communication of access ensures that communication rights are<br>
similarly controlled and transferable only by mutual consent.  [SNIP] <br>
<p>
The command model has frequently been considered more "rational",<br>
since it involves the visible application of reason to the economic<br>
problem as a whole. Alternatives have frequently been considered<br>
irrational and an invitation to chaos. This viewpoint, however, smacks<br>
of the creationist fallacy - it assumes that a coherent result<br>
requires a guiding plan. In actuality, decentralized planning is<br>
potentially more rational, since it involves more minds taking into<br>
account more total information. [SNIP]<br>
<p>
To combat this problem, modern object-oriented programming (to<br>
paraphrase [Hayek]) "secures to each object a known space within which<br>
it can decide on its actions, enabling the programmer to make the<br>
fullest use of his knowledge. Encapsulation tells him what facts he<br>
may count on and thereby extends the range within which he can predict<br>
the consequences of his actions". In short, motivated by the need for<br>
decentralized planning and division of labor, computer science has<br>
reinvented the notion of property rights.&gt;<br>
<p>
This is why I think we need many individuals and selves, rather than<br>
some Great Borganism, in order to create an extropian multiverse<br>
rather than an entropian universe headed for collapse.<br>
<p>
I said: This [LILA model] sounds no different to me from the Christian<br>
Apocalypse &amp; Resurrection.<br>
<p>
And Michael noted:<br>
&lt;As G. Spencer Brown said, the symbol = may be taken to mean "is<br>
confused with".&gt;<br>
<p>
I mistakenly posted an earlier version of what I wrote (working on<br>
multiple systems can be confusing ;-).  My final version of that<br>
statement said: This sounds to me too much like the Christian Original<br>
Sin, Apocalypse and Resurrection.<br>
<p>
My point about these "New Age" notions of unity (particularly LILA) is<br>
that, instead of "Out of Many, One", they want to say, "Out of One,<br>
Many; SO, back to One".  This is a Big Bang to Big Crunch scenario<br>
and, IMHO, it is Creationist; and, this yearning to "return to the<br>
One" is a desire to dissolve into the primal soup, an abdication of<br>
individual responsibility for carrying on the creation.<br>
<p>
I haven’t read G. Spenser-Brown, but I did take these notes from F.<br>
David Peat’s discussion of him in _Synchronicity_:<br>
<p>
&lt; Next, Peat's explores "the work of the logician and mathematician<br>
G.Spenser-Brown ... a rather enigmatic figure who first came to the<br>
attention of the aging Bertrand Russell in 1965.... 'Laws of Form'<br>
takes as its origin a basic act of distinction ... once an active<br>
observer or a creative act of perception, is admitted into this void,<br>
then it becomes possible to draw the first distinction ... [which]<br>
allows a movement to begin ... A particularly interesting feature of<br>
this logic is that it is capable of generating expressions that begin<br>
to refer to themselves ... Spenser-Brown's re-entrant forms are in<br>
fact self-generating expressions that are capable of perpetuating<br>
themselves indefinitely." Peat goes on to explain the importance of<br>
context to this Hegelian dialectic; but, he imparts too much<br>
significance to the initial creative 'big bang' and not enough to the<br>
ongoing adaptive process that is thus generated.<br>
<p>
02/11/96. And so, as "Synchronicity" wraps up, Peat curls himself into<br>
a sort of fetal position, seeking to return to the womb in a sense, by<br>
emphasizing the origin, "the pure, unconditioned perception," what he<br>
and the mystics call "the stillness", rather than the 'noisy', ongoing<br>
"creative unfolding ... able to respond to an ever-changing context." &gt;<br>
<p>
Mark Crosby<br>
<p>
P.S. re Rick Knight's latest response (read after writing the above):<br>
<p>
&lt;Frankly, thinking too much and too often makes me rather tired and <br>
despondent.  That's why I perceive it important to keep balance,<br>
breathe in and exhale out.  Quest then rest.&gt;<br>
<p>
Nothing wrong with that! That's just balance between Being and<br>
Becoming.  (I don't mean to be a "rigid fundie" about any of this ;-)<br>
<p>
I can't resist one more excerpt from my notes that addresses this:<br>
<p>
&lt;[Peat] confuses Being and Becoming: "The major barriers to a creative<br>
transformation of consciousness are the attachments of the self, which<br>
give rise to the mechanical order of becoming in which the more subtle<br>
and faster movements of nature are lost." This is backwards! Being is<br>
mechanical and static [or, at least, restful and neutral ;-] .<br>
Becoming is creative and dynamic. [snip] In lamenting the<br>
fragmentation of science, the alienation of the individual and the<br>
decay of civility, he sets up myths that are only true from a limited<br>
perspective that is preoccupied with the present. His "better notion<br>
of an intense and vibrant stillness" is little different from the<br>
fashionable notion of "holism" he decries which "suggests a self that<br>
becomes immersed in a warm bath of mindless gravy."  <br>
<p>
In the end though, it is merely a matter of semantics and taste that<br>
distinguishes my view from Peat's because he concludes: "Eternity does<br>
not exist outside the self ... to die to the self does not mean to<br>
sacrifice all identity or freedom of action in the explicate world.<br>
Rather it suggests a dying of attachments to rigid, fixed forms and an<br>
unfolding of sequential time into its wider [fractal] order.... So the<br>
dissolution of fragmentation does not imply the abandonment of all<br>
distinctions and categories; rather, it suggests that distinctions are<br>
constantly being created, modified and ended in harmony with the<br>
general movement of reality." If that is not a description of eternal<br>
Becoming rather than the static Being of the mystic then I must have<br>
my meanings plugged in wrong!&gt;<br>
