	In some cases, things that help the individual in early life hurt the<br>
individual in later life.  For instance, there is some evidence that cells<br>
are limited to a certain number of replications.  This could be a safe<br>
guard against cancer.  Of course, once we have aged and reached that number<br>
of replications naturally we may have problems.  But by that time we have<br>
probably had children and, in most of human history and maybe today, we<br>
have died of something else.<br>
