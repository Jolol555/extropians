quoth Hal Finney--<br>
: One problem with this is that the Zones are said to be shrinking at<br>
: 710 m/s.  This is about 2000 ly per billion years.  So if the Slow Zone<br>
: was pushed out beyond the Transcend, it would need to shrink more like<br>
: 10,000 ly to be back to where it is today, requiring 5 billion years.<br>
: But this is much longer than their history seems to go back.  Possibly the<br>
: surge is more temporary, shrinking back at a much faster rate initially,<br>
: then slowing down as the Zones approach their "natural" states.  In that<br>
: case the previous incarnation of the Blight might have happened only a<br>
: billion or two years ago.<br>
<p>
Didn't the Zones contract around Tines World just before the<br>
Countermeasure's final surge, so that Tines World was briefly<br>
in Transcend?<br>
<p>
One thing we do know (from "The Blabber") is that Ravna is destined<br>
to return to the Beyond, somehow.<br>
