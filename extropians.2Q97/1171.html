     Greetings all,<br>
     <br>
     As I've noticed one extropian aspiration is physical life extension <br>
     which I'm all for (actually quality of life over quantity of years <br>
     seems preferable but if we shaped up our act as a society, I might be <br>
     persuaded to stay on the planet longer &lt;G&gt;).  I've been recently taken <br>
     with the notion that it would be quite ironic that right about the <br>
     time we cinch the mortality issues and can extend physical human life <br>
     indefinitely through our technology, we will also have discovered a <br>
     spectrum of energy that could/will be defined as consciousness or, <br>
     more classically, the soul.  <br>
     <br>
     I've rather casually associated a metaphor of a laser with a <br>
     "self-aware discarnate entity".  The laser, being a concentrated beam <br>
     of photon energy, the uses of which continue to revolutionize our way <br>
     of life and our "self", also seemingly a concentration of thought and <br>
     potent awareness.  Though lasers they have been found to exist in <br>
     nature, our discovery and harnessing of them and how they work has <br>
     given us another tool in our ongoing discovery of "fire".  One step up <br>
     the ladder, monkey boys! (think Lithgow in Buckaroo Bonzai).  Perhaps <br>
     a discovery that self is not just an contrivance of our desperate <br>
     ego-based, and physically bound existence but more an instinctual <br>
     knowing that we have been and always will be (maybe it's something <br>
     that is a "Known" right down to the quantum level but that we can't <br>
     yet prove).<br>
     <br>
     I'm presently not very well read on the myths of all cultures but in <br>
     the Judeo-Christian motif out of which many people in Western Civ have <br>
     emerged, self-awareness is the first energy mentioned in Genesis, that <br>
     self-awareness being "God" (not compelling religious discussion here) <br>
     who then spoke (vibrated) light.  Archetypes, regardless of the <br>
     validity one might attach to them, are fascinating in how they take on <br>
     an iconic position in culture.  Could self-awareness, of what was <br>
     primitively regarded as Godhood be just around the corner in our <br>
     scientific understanding?  <br>
     <br>
     My latest reading project is "A Brief History of Everything" by Ken <br>
     Wilber and his theory of holarchy (every "thing" has the <br>
     characteristics of being a part and a whole) is quite fascinating.  <br>
     I'm quite busy and I read slowly (it's because I'm a writer/editor I <br>
     imagine...can't quickly gulp up concept because the structure of words <br>
     is so preoccupying my thought process) so it'll be a while before I'm <br>
     done with the book but I wouldn't mind anyone who has read the book <br>
     piping up with some of their thoughts on it.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
