<i>&gt;  According to the definition of "cult" in one popular internet book I</i><br>

As far as this mailing list goes we're just a common interests group, no<br>
different from a mailing list on cars, for instance.  We don't have a leader,<br>
we don't have a god, we don't all hang out in some weird church (and if we<br>
do, I haven't been invited).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I don't see it here. Of course, we could then market ourselves as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Un-Cult or Anti-Cult. Considering that most ignoramuses see philosophy</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (Max's pidgin) as religion for intellectuals or pretentious theology,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  perhaps it would behoove us to angle ExI on a more political line in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  order to make plain our strictly non-religious focus.</i><br>
<p>
Having said that, the ExI logo and the extropy.org website do look a bit<br>
'cultish'.<br>
