<i>&gt; From: Max More &lt;maxmore@primenet.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A few of us in So Cal have been meeting to discuss investments. I am very</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in helping the development and communication of investment</i><br>
<i>&gt; wisdom among Extropians. You know the expression: "If you're so smart, how</i><br>
<i>&gt; come you're not rich?" We should all have a compelling answer... "Just take</i><br>
<i>&gt; a look at my portfolio, buddy!"</i><br>
<p>
Here are my thoughts.<br>
<p>
1) The markets are not perfectly efficient -- perfect efficiency<br>
   requires perfect information transfer. The fact that markets are<br>
   ever shifting, products ever changing, information always taking<br>
   time to diffuse, means they can never be perfectly<br>
   efficient. However, the markets are pretty damn close to efficient<br>
   these days -- efficient enough that things like day trading are a<br>
   risky way to make a living.<br>
2) It is possible to exploit market inefficiencies to make money. I've<br>
   seen people who are just too far out of the statistical spectrum to<br>
   be accidents -- traders like Paul Tudor Jones and Louis<br>
   Bacon. These people are, however, unusual. I've seen far, far more<br>
   people who can't manage to trade their way out of a paper<br>
   bag.<br>
3) The people who are guaranteed a place at the banquet are the casino<br>
   owners. Brokers always get their vig. Traders -- especially<br>
   amateurs -- don't always do so well. In the futures market, friends<br>
   of mine at Refco tell me the average time between opening a futures<br>
   trading account and losing *ALL* your stake is about a year.<br>
4) The people who do manage to make money "trading" rather than<br>
   "investing" are almost inevitably full time professionals who are<br>
   very, very smart -- and even they sometimes "blow up". The author<br>
   of the famous "Memoirs of a Stock Operator", Larry Livingston,<br>
   killed himself a few years after writing his book after losing<br>
   every penny he had.<br>
<p>
My advice is therefore this: if you feel like you are drawn to the<br>
securities markets and are young when you start and a risk taker, much<br>
money is to be made from trading. However, you won't find that most of<br>
the people in the Forbes 400 got there this way, and its a dangerous<br>
way to make a living. For every guy that turns out to have the right<br>
combination of tallent and luck, hundreds or thousands lose their<br>
shirts.<br>
<p>
On the other hand....<br>
<p>
1) Over the long term, the stock market DOES outperform almost all<br>
   other investments -- and outperforms it handsomely.<br>
2) You don't even have to think much to make money in the markets:<br>
   passive investments like buying into an S&amp;P 500 following mutual<br>
   fund do bring their investors excellent returns.<br>
3) Even random portfolios of sufficient size do pretty well in<br>
   general.<br>
4) People who have a slight information edge -- like understanding<br>
   what a high tech company does -- can sometimes get an advantage<br>
   even if they aren't full time investors.<br>
<p>
My advice is therefore simple.<br>
<p>
If you want to be rich, you have two options:<br>
<p>
Option one: get a good job, save as much of your money has you can<br>
bear to starting when you are young, and invest it in mutual funds or<br>
in a diversified porfolio. If you wait long enough, the returns will<br>
be good. The higher paying the job, the more you can afford to<br>
save. Almost everyone can do this and be assured of living comfortably<br>
if you have enough patience. No, it isn't glamorous, and it won't make<br>
you "filthy rich". However, as the toroise and the hare found out,<br>
slow and steady often wins. If you can save 20% or more of your income<br>
and you invest all of it, in ten or twenty years you'll find yourself<br>
with a nice amount of cash.<br>
<p>
Option two: start a high growth business. This is the most practical<br>
way to become "filthy rich". It is, however, stressful and not for<br>
everyone -- and not everyone has good ideas.<br>
<p>
Combining these strategies is, of course, perfectly reasonable.<br>
