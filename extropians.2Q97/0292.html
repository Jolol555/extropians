In a message dated 97-04-11 08:53:58 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Geoff </i><br>
<i>&gt;   but your so called 'mystics' have found meditation does it also. Also</i><br>
<i>&gt;  exercise seems to help and mindless simple things like shaving...</i><br>
<i>&gt;  driving....</i><br>
<i>&gt;  This process helps with creativity also. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
ard:<br>
<i>&gt;  	It appears that creativity can be accessed when one gets out of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  critical, judgemental state of mind.  This is referred to as "being in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  space".  This can be accomplished by remaining focused on "the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  concentration".  The mindless activities, you mention, are ways of</i><br>
dropping<br>
<i>&gt;  the critical, judgemental state of mind.and leaving oneself open to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  creative process.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
You have made good observation about the creative process. Nevertheless, <br>
I see no evidence  that these activities are specifically good for letting go<br>
of critical thinking, which is another part of the creative process, and an<br>
important one.<br>
But they do occupy a portion of the mind's focus, and perhaps conversely<br>
allow the mind to "unfocus" a little. This could cause the mind to relax,<br>
slip into reverie and intuition ( a state where the mind can unconsciously<br>
choose from stacks of memories which are relevant to the problem, and bring<br>
up the most appealing solution excatly *without* apparent thought on "the<br>
point of concentration" or focus).<br>
