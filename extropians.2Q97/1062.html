Um......okay.<br>
<p>
I don't want to seem completely paranoid, but..... <br>
<p>
How can the Times know EXACTLY how much the budget is. Fair enough, you<br>
said it was an estimate but their figures may still only scratch the<br>
surface - there may actually be an Illuminati, a Hagbard Celine, etc. etc.<br>
<p>
The Times could take a look at my garbage/bank account and tell the<br>
world exactly what I consumed last year, but it would hardly be accurate<br>
considering how much I recycle/spend and how much I don't throw <br>
away/channel into other areas.<br>
<p>
<p>
I am not a conspiracy freak but neither do I believe that we can fully<br>
know the budget of certain government agencies.<br>
