	I would not worry about it.  Most of the cult activities that people worry<br>
about are illegal anyway (like psychedelic drug use, hey wait a second...<br>
:&gt;).  Others are quite stupid and rather opposed to Extropian ideas.  Of<br>
course, the word "cult" most likely would inspire some people to suspend<br>
all rational judgment, so they might not realize that uploading is a means,<br>
not an end, never mind more subtle things (anarcho-capatilism for one).  <br>
	We have a long way to go before we reach the level of cult that the<br>
Catholic church has reached.  Of course, we have a long way to go before we<br>
reach their level of political pull as well (at which point everyone would<br>
start losing political pull, anarcho-capatilism forever!).<br>

<i>&gt; Are there any laws banning "cult" activities?  Should Extropians beware,</i><br>
