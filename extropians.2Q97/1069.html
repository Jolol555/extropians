<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Quite simple.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1) Media propaganda.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; WHose? The Cuban Government jams all US radio and television boradcasts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the point of occasionally interfering in the southern Florida</i><br>
<i>&gt; broadcast market area. Cubans get a banana version of the BBC: 3</i><br>
<i>&gt; channels of government propaganda.</i><br>
<p>
I do not only see TV and radio as media, but also people. Trained<br>
demagogues who are supposed to infiltrate Cuba. Such operations have<br>
always taken place, not only in Cuba, but in other countries, too. When<br>
you see big demonstrations in the Tv, like in Bosnia, Bulgaria etc.,<br>
this can only be the effect of media propaganda. The fact that such<br>
demonstrations haven't taken place in Cuba shows that the US influence<br>
is not strong enough to do this. Castro isn't a bum, he will keep this<br>
influence as low as possible, not because he wants to keep his power but<br>
because he knows that many people would suffer otherwise.<br>
<p>
The US have always done everything possible to get rid of communist<br>
countries. This little Cuba is, besides North Korea, one of<br>
the last socialist regimes which doesn't privatize itself too much. The<br>
effects on the people living there are bad, and maybe free markets would<br>
make the standard of living better for many of them (making Cuba what it<br>
was under Batista, the brothel and casino of the US) -- but if Cuba was<br>
a free market country and isolated the way it is now, you can be sure<br>
that it would be much worse there than in North Korea.<br>
<p>
One can be sure: For a country under these conditions, Cuba is doing as<br>
good as possible. If I would live there, I might try to get to the US,<br>
too -- in the hope that things are better there. But it isn't very<br>
likely that they'd be for me, with about 20 % poor children.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 2) Financial support by US secret services -- many exile Cubans indeed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have a better life in the US today. Cubans are among the least likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; become poor.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They are the least likely to become poor compared to who? Asian</i><br>
<i>&gt; immigrants far outstrip all other immigrants in terms of educational</i><br>
<i>&gt; attainment and per capita income. Cubans fare better than their Mexican</i><br>
<i>&gt; ethnic cousins for one reason: Cuban refugees are fleeing a government</i><br>
<i>&gt; that supresses their ability to succeed, while Mexicans are attracted to</i><br>
<i>&gt; a welfare system that is much better than their own. </i><br>
<p>
Compared to other Latin Americans. About 19.7 % of Cuban children in the<br>
US are poor (Puerto Rican: 40.4 %).<br>
<p>
Cuba doesn't supress any abilities, it just prevents people from<br>
becoming richer than necessary.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; I'm not for economic isolation. Nor is communism (see COMECON). And Cuba</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is practically isolated today. Yet it has a child mortality of a level</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; comparable to that of industrialized free market economies (8, if I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; remember correctly, and the US got about 7).</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That is the publicized rate. Never trust the propaganda of communist</i><br>
<i>&gt; governments.</i><br>
<p>
When you claim that they spread propaganda, you must prove it. It has<br>
been proven for US media millions of times (see media during Vietnam &amp;<br>
Gulf War, presidential elections etc.). And the media in the US aren't<br>
owned by gov't. Why do they support it? Because all big enterprises want<br>
a *strong* gov't helping them to stay big and to collect money. They<br>
could do without it, too -- and many of the big ones therefore try to<br>
privatize the state.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nor is Cuba practically isolated today. This just goes to show how much</i><br>
<i>&gt; you really know about current events. While the US, its largest and</i><br>
<i>&gt; nearest neigbor has shut off trade, they have rebuilt trade with Mexico,</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of South AMerica, as well as many European and African countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; that don't need or want to kow tow to US gov't demands. Canada is a HUGE</i><br>
<i>&gt; partner with Cuba, and is the biggest propagandizer of the campaign</i><br>
<i>&gt; against Helms Burton, because Canadian companies are making major bank</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the Cuban fire sales of seized properties. Canada is the big hypocrit</i><br>
<i>&gt; here. People wonder why we dont pursue the same policies with regard to</i><br>
<i>&gt; China, N. Korea, and Cuba. Its obvious that China and N Korea never</i><br>
<i>&gt; seized anywhere near the same level of assets as the Cubans did.</i><br>
<p>
Nonsense. With the US, a main trade partner is gone. Economic<br>
impoverishment is a direct consequence of this.<br>
<p>
I am no communist. I wouldn't want to live in Cuba, North Korea or even<br>
China. I already said that my "dream-economy" is that of Japan,<br>
partially because of state intervention, partially because of a kind of<br>
"politics of consent". Big enterprise leaders there have realized that<br>
operating the way US leaders do would lead their country back to the<br>
Middle Age.<br>
