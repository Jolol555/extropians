Well, what can I say except.., you're right. I believe the iterated Prisoner's <br>
Dilemma is one of the most complex situations conceivable, so no matter what I <br>
say about it I'm opening myself up to the charge of gross oversimplification.  <br>
If everybody adopted a tit-for-tat strategy most people and the world in <br>
general would be better off, however a mutant that always defected would do <br>
better than anybody else in such a population. A defector would produce more <br>
descendants,  until a sizable fraction of the population were defectors, and <br>
then they would be worse off  than their honest contemporaries and their<br>
numbers decline. If things were simple and tit-for-tat was always the best <br>
strategy then by now, after 4 billion years of Evolution, everybody would be <br>
genetically determined to be scrupulously honest. <br>
That has not been my experience.<br>

                        <br>
<p>
You have to know your in the game, that your counterpart exists, but you <br>
don't have to identify him.<br>
<p>
                  <br>
<i>        &gt;and rough parity has to exist         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by this but I'll add one, your counterpart can't  <br>
be too clever. If your opponent's strategy is too complex it will look random <br>
to you and you won't be able to play along. One good thing about tit-for-tat <br>
is that it's simple.<br>
          <br>

True. I don't have a very high opinion of US Senators but they almost always <br>
keep their promises, those made to other Senators that is. Having a reputation <br>
for honesty among fellow Senators is to your advantage so you work at it,   <br>
developing such a reputation with Mr. Joe Average would be no great benefit <br>
so the hell with it.<br>
<p>
In the First World War the same solders sometimes fought each other from <br>
their trenches for months at a time, they started to get polite, no artillery <br>
attacks at dinner time or when bathing, they let the wounded be evacuated and <br>
the mail truck get through. The  Generals thought things were getting a <br>
little too comfy so they started to rotate the troops around more often and<br>
the cooperation ended.<br>
