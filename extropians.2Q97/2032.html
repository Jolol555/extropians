Interesting, I read these books at about 14 and I don't even remember<br>
the term Libertarian.  I had forgotten all about the cryonics story<br>
until you mentioned it.  I do remember lots of weird stuff and it all<br>
got lumped in together.  I also read Prolongevity at about the same time.<br>
I already wanted to live forever but I had not yet shaken off lots of<br>
religious beliefs so pyramid power was about as appealing as cryonics.<br>
<p>
I would love to hear the history of how various people on the list came<br>
to hold some of their extropic ideas.  <br>
