<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Thank you for your motivating message.</i><br>
<p>
Dankon for being motivated Don.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would like help in promoting legislative support for anti-aging </i><br>
<i>&gt;research. We are learning grass roots techniques in influencing </i><br>
<i>&gt;legislation. We need realistic goals that would be accepted by decision </i><br>
<i>&gt;makers.  Letters and phone calls to legislators get results if we know </i><br>
<i>&gt;what issues to promote and have credible information to educate them.</i><br>
<p>
 Know people intimately;<br>
know their thoughts before suggesting ideas.<br>
Know all by name, policy, and hobbies;<br>
know who they are, what is happing to them.<br>
Let conversation be fun, and to the point.<br>
Do NOT send a novel unless they ask,<br>
offer to explain more.<br>
Decorate letters for attention; <br>
be noticed.<br>
Relate suggestions to their past ideas.<br>
Let them know you share views.<br>
Be their new best friend; <br>
do NOT seem obsessive.<br>
Send Inexpensive gift they like: flower, candy, cigar, <br>
donation in their name to charity, thing for child/loved one.<br>
Let them feel love,<br>
remember they are people.<br>
