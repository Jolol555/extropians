Last night I found myself in a futile conversation.  I couldn't tell at<br>
first if this woman was on a mystic-trip or actually in touch with<br>
reality, but I new it was over when she said, "Have you read _The<br>
Celestine Prophesy_?"  I'm sure many of you have been there...<br>
<p>
The woman I conversed with exhibited a pattern of thought that I've noticed in<br>
numerous conversations with New Agers:  They can rebuke any attempt at<br>
rational thought b/c their belief system allows them to say anything,<br>
making up mind-fodder as they go along.  Now, many of you who are far more<br>
leathal at intellectual sparring than I are surely more successful at arguing<br>
with mystics than I.  My arguing skills are need of developement (hence<br>
this post).  As I struggle to put together rational replies to their<br>
fanciful ramblings, these mystics run circles around my logic.  How do<br>
experienced rational thinkers deal with people who can say anything (that<br>
is to the extent that they can be dealt with)?<br>
<p>
Also, these people think they are quantum mechanics, rigging their<br>
silliness with quatum "stuff."  These people don't even have a clue about the<br>
concept of a quantized energy packet, yet they think that watching _Quantum<br>
Leap_ or reading books by quacks who give no references gives them<br>
understanding enough to invoke quantum physics as "proof" of their<br>
madness.  I know just enough about quantum mechanics to know not to f***<br>
with it, yet they don't notice that the people who do know what they're<br>
talking about spend years, if not decades, understanding quantum mechanics<br>
to the extent that is understood.  These fruit-loops are a sad lot.  <br>
<p>
Enough angst.  <br>
<p>
Exovivo!<br>
