Hmm, only a few hours ago I was reading a book while walking to my dance<br>
class (finally decided I had to read all the Vernor Vinge books I've<br>
missed), and didn't crash into anything. Just a matter of good situational<br>
awareness... <br>
<p>
Steve Roberts (the original Technomad) used to read and write email while<br>
cycling, so doing so while walking can't be any harder or more dangerous. <br>

<i>&gt; Why, exactly, do you need a head-up and a head tracker to replace paper ?</i><br>
<p>
Because I can't carry 1 GB of data around on paper. I also can't create<br>
Web sites on paper, or play Duke Nukem on paper... of course walking and<br>
playing Duke Nukem could get a little more dangerous than reading ;-). <br>

<p>
Because Microsoft didn't write the operating system? <br>

<i>&gt; It's a lot to ask from an industry seems to spend more time making colorful</i><br>

<i>&gt; applications that don't just decide to 'loose all unsaved information'.  </i><br>
<p>
Well, I run Linux so I don't have these problems (I don't really miss the<br>
colorful icons). Worst that ever happens is losing the last bookmark or<br>
two when buggy old Netscape blows away every couple of weeks. <br>
