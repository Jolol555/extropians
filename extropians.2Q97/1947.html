<i>&gt;That's one of the few issues upon which libertarians, and even</i><br>
<i>&gt;Objectivists, have no specific stance.  I've seen Friedman make</i><br>
<i>&gt;economic arguments against it, but I think in general libertarians</i><br>
<i>&gt;are split just as the public is.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Unilaterally killing someone is an irretrievable act of aggression -- <br>
murder, all the worse for being carried out against a captive person with <br>
no means of self-defence, and who may -- it may transpire -- be _innocent <br>
of the crime for which they are executed_.<br>
<p>
The liberal (word used in its widest sense here) argument against is that <br>
the laws protecting rightsd should be upheld _with only the absolute <br>
minimum of violence which may be necessary.<br>
<p>
<p>
It is quite extraordinary that anarchists or libertarians -- of all people <br>
-- should endorse the death 'penalty.' All this can lead to in practice is <br>
assassinations and coldly calculated judicial murders by the State.  Or <br>
lynch mobs.<br>
<p>
That anyone can imagine that this can possibly lead to a more liberal, or <br>
libertartian, or more anarchist society is *entirely risible*.<br>
<p>
<p>
[1] Execution itself is _morally indefensdible_.  Ity degrades everyone <br>
associated with its practice.  That can only serve to degrade the justice <br>
system itself.  It also in itself violates fundamental laws.<br>
<p>
CIA prohibited assassinations for moral and prudential reasons which <br>
Richard Bissell gives in his autobiography, "Reflections of a Cold <br>
Warrior"  [Yasle, 1996]. Not least, because it degrades policymaking with <br>
an 'Off with their head' modality of thought. He was chief economist to <br>
the Marshall Plan, Deputy Director, Plans at cIA, and President of the <br>
Institute for Defense analyses at princeton. He studied economics under <br>
hayek for a year, at LSE, and found him incomprehensible (Hayek's English <br>
was noe too intelligible back then &gt;:-} ].<br>
<p>
<p>
[2] It's _unnecessary_: check the murder rates country by country and <br>
compare them with the execution rates.  Supporters would predict an iverse <br>
correlation:  but there is none.  In fact, countries with execution are <br>
frequently _more_ murder-prone.  Every country in Europe is safer than any <br>
state in the US, AFAIK.<br>
<p>
<p>
[3] In fully rights based libertarian terms, it's *impossible.*<br>
<p>
Reasons:<br>
<p>
[a] The accused is tried in court.  The prosecution team, the jury and the <br>
trial judge(s) must accept personal responsibility for the outcome.  They <br>
are all subject to execution if they turn out to have got it wrong, and <br>
have in fact convicted (and thus caused to be executed) an innocent man,<br>
<p>
<p>
[b] An executioner must be found.  He must be liable to execution should <br>
his executing the accused should prove factually unwarranted.  You won't <br>
find one.  The jailers are accessories to murder, too.  Their belief that <br>
they were somehow 'justified' in conspiring to kill is hardly relevant as <br>
a defence.<br>
<p>
[c] All of the above-mentioned people must also be able to provide full <br>
and prompt restitution to all the friends, relatives, business associates <br>
etc., who are themselves gravely damaged by the execution _even though <br>
they've done nothing wrong_.<br>
<p>
[d] Not many candidates for the above-mentioned roles is likely to have <br>
that sort of money, and no insurance company would carry the risk on their <br>
behalf.<br>
<p>
[e] If it's a statutory death penalty, _all the people who voted for it_ <br>
are also liable and subject to criminal and civil proceedings.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
Thought-experiment:<br>
<p>
You get to vote on the matter, try the case, or execute the person, if -- <br>
-- and only if -- you agree to  this procedure.<br>
<p>
If the man is convicted and sentenced, you must spend a month getting to <br>
know the accused, and get to know them, their friends, family and <br>
colleagues. Their unique and irreplaceable selves.<br>
<p>
You must then try to learn what really happened, and why.<br>
<p>
At the completion of the month, you _have_ to execute the accused _even if <br>
you believe they're innocent, and you'll destroy the hasppiness of others, <br>
perhaps deprive the world of irreplaceable talents, and be executed <br>
yourself into the bargain.<br>
<p>
Would _you_ accept these terms?  If not, why not?<br>
<p>
Would you ask _anyone else_ to?  Seriously?  How do you think they would <br>
reply to you?<br>
<p>
