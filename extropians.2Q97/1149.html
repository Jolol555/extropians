In a message dated 97-05-14 11:30:35 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  don't you recall that little</i><br>
<i>&gt;  incident about attempting to install Soviet ICBM's 90 mile from our</i><br>
<i>&gt;  shores?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
Actually, the Soviets were installing SS-4s, which are ballistic missiles,<br>
but not ICBMs.  They did have a throw-weight substantial enough to deliver 1<br>
MT warheads, though.  <br>
Of course, in reality, the entire affair may not have had anything to do with<br>
basing missiles.  The incident was more likely about keeping the United<br>
States out of the Soviet's new "forward deployment base" than about keeping<br>
the missiles there.<br>
