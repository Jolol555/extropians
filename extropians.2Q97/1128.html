&lt;snipped Cuban rant&gt;<br>
<p>
Sure, heard it all before.  Used to listen to Radio Moscow late at <br>
night while on tower duty on the East German border when I was is the <br>
U.S. Army in the early eighties.  I remember specifically that we <br>
were using chemical and biological weapons in Afganistan,  sabotaging <br>
Aeroflot airliners, building an earthquake machine to destroy the <br>
Motherland, runnning Nazi style deathcamps in Arizona, and kidnaping <br>
and murdering border guards late at night on infiltration missions.  <br>
I can only speak from personal knowledge on the later:  we hardly <br>
ever kidnapped them, and the only torture I personally witnessed was <br>
when the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders went to OP Alpha on a USO tour, <br>
and those poor East German conscripts were stuck on the other side <br>
going out of their minds trying to get a look.<br>
<p>
Several years later I  knew the Soviet Union was truely dead when I <br>
was again listening to shortwave and was totally shocked when what I <br>
thought was the BBC identified itself as Radio Moscow.  Used to be <br>
you could tell the difference in second.  Sometimes I almost miss the <br>
old one.  Almost.<br>
