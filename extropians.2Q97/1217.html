	John,<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; "In a study published in February in the journal Neurological Research, </i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists report how spatial-temporal reasoning in 3- and 4-year-olds </i><br>
<i>&gt; was affected by weekly piano lessons</i><br>
<p>
 What <br>
<i>&gt; explains the effect?  Physicist Gordon Shaw of the University of </i><br>
<i>&gt; California, Irvine, suspects that in playing the piano, "you are seeing </i><br>
<i>&gt; tho patterns work in space and time."  When sequential finger and key </i><br>
<i>&gt; patterns make melodies, neural circuits that connect positions (keys) to </i><br>
<i>&gt; sounds in space and time (the melody) are strengthened.  "Music training </i><br>
<i>&gt; produces long-term modifications in neural circuitry," says Shaw.  What </i><br>
<i>&gt; scientists do not know is whether the effects of early music training </i><br>
<i>&gt; endure - whether the preschoolers will be math wizards in high school."</i><br>
<p>
	Thanks for the memory jog.  It was Mr. Shaw in an interview on an American<br>
station that we had watched.    By the by...our 8-year-old grandaughter has<br>
been giving recitals for two years, and she IS a math wizard....so is her<br>
mother and our youngest son, both of whom play the piano.   We definitely<br>
live in interesting times.<br>
