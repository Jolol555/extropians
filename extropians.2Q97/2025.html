<i>&gt; would have private protection agencies (PPA's) to back them up. Disputes</i><br>
<i>&gt; among PPA's would be settled by an independent arbitrator agreed to by both</i><br>
<i>&gt; parties BEFORE the disagreement happened. Something like that can happen</i><br>
<i>&gt; today. When companies sign complicated contracts they sometimes also agree on</i><br>
<i>&gt; who will arbitrate it if differences in interpretation happen. Nobody wants</i><br>
<i>&gt; to get caught up in the slow, expensive court system run by governments. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; arbitrator would be paid by the case, and because he is picked by both sides,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's in his interest to be as just as possible. If he favored one side over</i><br>
<i>&gt; another or made brutal or stupid decisions he would not be picked again and</i><br>
<i>&gt; would need to look for a new line of work. Unlike present day judges and</i><br>
<i>&gt; juries, justice would have a positive survival value for the arbitrator.</i><br>
<p>
My question concerns what we are really advocating here. I see only an<br>
ounce of anarchism in all of it. Where there exists a law, there must<br>
exist coercion, otherwise what is its point? And where there exists<br>
coercion, there exists something doing the coercing. Whether or not it's<br>
a person or a piece of paper, it's government pure and simple. The<br>
profit-motive basis is extremely interesting to me, but<br>
democro-capitalism seems to me just as worthwhile. <br>
<p>
Why not just make an all encompassing contract (say, a Constitution)<br>
which one may choose to sign or not. We can name an arbitrator (say, a<br>
Supreme Court) which will interpret the terms of the contract. Anyone<br>
who signs the contract (we can call them "citizens") are also allowed to<br>
live in a certain geographical area (let's call this the U.S.) which is<br>
protected by a large PPA (say, an Army). Those who have signed the<br>
contract and then breach (let's call these guys "criminals") are<br>
correspondingly punished according to the terms of the contract they<br>
have signed (let's call this "expatriation"). Correspondingly, lets also<br>
make an even bigger contract (called the United Nations) to make sure<br>
the U.S. doesn't just decide to enslave the world. Or even better, let's<br>
make a worldwide contract (called Gaia)...<br>
<p>
Et cetera.<br>
<p>
What is anarchy? Anarchy in the traditional sense is an absence of<br>
government. Just look at the world prior to WWI. Treat each country as<br>
an individual person. There is no world government to speak of, no<br>
international law, merely treaties between nations. War has always<br>
happened, even in the presence of treaties. A treaty (or contract) is<br>
often a sly way of throwing the other party off. The history of<br>
international relations until WWI is a study in anarchy. Accordingly,<br>
the history of humanity is the history of war between nations in an<br>
anarchic system. Regardless, can we make it work? <br>
<p>
While I see that it is anarchic, in some sense, to have all people<br>
contracting singly with all others in order to protect themselves, how<br>
can this be desirable? You can't make a contract with every single<br>
person you come into contact with. And if every possible term of the<br>
contract is open to debate (such as whether I may kill you for XYZ<br>
reasons; or if your first-born son will be interest for a three million<br>
monetary unit loan) then people will be required to spend all their time<br>
making contracts. IMO, this is ridiculous. The only real option is a<br>
contract among groups of people. So we're back again to a government.<br>
<p>
Contracts is a sticky business. Without an established law of contracts,<br>
this idea won't even work. Offer, acceptance, consideration? That's only<br>
the beginning. What happens when the named arbitrator dies? Or is killed<br>
by my hired thugs? What happens if I forge your signature on a contract<br>
and you forge my name on another? What about a contract of adhesion?<br>
What about unequal bargaining power? What about fraud, duress, or<br>
unconscionability? <br>
<p>
Et cetera.<br>
<p>
It is no solution to pretend that we can include all permutations of<br>
eventualities in a blanket term of the contract. It is similarly inane<br>
to attempt to treat each specifically. There must some things that are<br>
just "understood" as common to all and decent for all. <br>
<p>
I sense that what is really desired here is actually a very *LIMITED*<br>
meta-contract for everyone. This would cover the bare essentials (let's<br>
call these life, liberty, and property) and leave everything else open<br>
for debate. But then again, this is not anarachy. So I must be wrong. <br>
<p>
IMO, the only certainty in a world where every human relationship is<br>
codified, signed in triplicate, registered, notarized, and vaulted is<br>
total war.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing</i><br>
<i>&gt; parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence</i><br>
<i>&gt; is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in</i><br>
<i>&gt; making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect</i><br>
<i>&gt; the total level of violence to be less than what we have now, but I'm not</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. Even when force is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; used the implicit threat is always there, another good reason to be civilized.</i><br>
<p>
Ugh. This is Mutually Assured Destruction all over again. This is saying<br>
that total war would not occur, indeed violence would occur with less<br>
frequency. I am quite optomistic about humanity, but this is too much<br>
for even me to say. Again I point to the only example I can of true<br>
anarchy -- the world at any point before WWI. War between nations is our<br>
history.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, to me, the preceding quotation suggests that the<br>
profit-motive is the final arbiter. In this situation, what does one<br>
measure one's profit in? Not dollars or francs or rubles, because a<br>
currency would require a large group contract which would "govern" its<br>
value. What happens when a party declares his rubles to be worth more<br>
than the contract stipulates? Send a PPA after him? This is coercion;<br>
this is government; this is not anarchy. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a rich man's PPA</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on my</i><br>
<i>&gt; mother being the judge if I get into trouble)  it's going to need</i><br>
<i>&gt; one hell of a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is</i><br>
<i>&gt; expensive because of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages</i><br>
<i>&gt; it will need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. To pay for</i><br>
<i>&gt; all this they will need to charge their clients enormous fees severely</i><br>
<i>&gt; limiting their customer base and that means even higher charges. They could</i><br>
<i>&gt; never get the upper hand, because the common man's PPA would be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; outspend a PPA that had outrageous demands and was just for the super rich.</i><br>
<i>&gt; A yacht cost a lot more than a car, yet the Ford motor Company is far richer</i><br>
<i>&gt; than all the yacht builders on the planet combined.</i><br>
<p>
So then a weapons race among PPA's? Small tactical nukes built from the<br>
Anarchist's Cookbook? I foresee a very convoluted, and profitable<br>
weapons industry -- not exactly world peace, and a waste of valuable<br>
resources which might be used for more transhuman pursuits. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the</i><br>
<i>&gt; greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. In a dictatorship one</i><br>
<i>&gt; man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans</i><br>
<i>&gt; could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically .</i><br>
<p>
But in the U.S. republic, there's nothing one idiot can do in four years<br>
that the next idiot can't undo in four years. So eventually the 49%<br>
become 51% and kill the other 49%. We don't really get anywhere, but we<br>
sure as hell bounce back and forth like mad. I like this system because<br>
it keeps the idiots occupied, leaving us free to go about our business<br>
of ascension.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to</i><br>
<i>&gt; kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. Jews  would be willing to pay as</i><br>
<i>&gt; much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%.</i><br>
<i>&gt; As a result the PPA protecting Jews  would be much stronger than the one that</i><br>
<i>&gt; wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you</i><br>
<i>&gt; (like not getting  killed) you have much more influence than just one man</i><br>
<i>&gt; one vote.</i><br>
<p>
So I should spend everything I have to avoid being killed? How is this<br>
better than a 100% income tax?<br>
<p>
