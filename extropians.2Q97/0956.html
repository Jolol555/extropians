I got the following digest from TheeDataBase, an e-zine. The mag used to<br>
be great but now I am not so sure. Any comments on the predictions that<br>
follow?<br>
<p>
I personally doubt an 'artificial brain' will be possible in 2037. Have<br>
British Telecom gone absolutely mad?<br>

Forward: POSSIBLE FUTURES<br>
<p>
<p>
British Telecom's last set of technological predictions prepared us for<br>
data chips stored in our heads that were downloadable upon death.  Last<br>
week, BT's Applied Research and Technologies department presented us with<br>
the sci-fi scenario of a cat that would book taxis on our behalf.  Not<br>
quite as essential as life after death, but for the couch-conscious of the<br>
world, it may be seen as the best step forward.<br>
<p>
The predictions can be chronologically listed as follows (commentary by<br>
BT's Head of department, Ian Pearson) :<br>
<p>
1999 : man-made blood and artificial pancreas will be available to<br>
patients.  We will also be "talking to our fridges" by introducing an email<br>
pager that you talk to, with a magnet on the back to attatch to<br>
aforementioned refridgerator.<br>
2007 : we will be carrying "personal health monitors" to warn us before we<br>
become ill.<br>
2010 : artificial cats and dogs will be introduced<br>
The robot "cat" is already here and living in Pearson's kitchen.  "It would<br>
not take much to add robotic legs and furry covering and replacing the<br>
insides with a radio link to a pwerful computer.  The cat could then be<br>
your personal butler, booking taxis, doing your home shopping and sorting<br>
out your accounts."<br>
2015 : a bionic man will artifical legs will be a reality<br>
"because of advances in processing speed and memory storage, computers wil<br>
be more intelligent and creative than man in 2015.  By 2025 we will be able<br>
to read what the brain is thinking and feed information into it to<br>
supercede learning."<br>
2020 : Property values become so high that complete underground cities are<br>
constructed, serviced by computerised appliances that will recognise our<br>
desires by body language.<br>
2030 : other artifical organs will be available such as lungs, kidneys,<br>
liver and "senses"<br>
2037 : artifical brain invented<br>
"we will have minimised all technologies so that a computer the size of the<br>
brain, but more powerful and able to control the human body, could be used<br>
in brain transplants."<br>
