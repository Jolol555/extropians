Business is the tail that wags the government's dog in Japan. The level<br>

economy than a centrally controlled one.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; About 50 years ago, on the Korean peninsula, a controlled experiment</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which half doesn't have any mentionable economic relationships to other</i><br>

<i>&gt; Imagine an isolated Japan.</i><br>
<p>
North Korea was a hell hole even at the peak of Soviet and or Chinese<br>
support. Me thinks you've swallowed a bit too much propaganda to remain<br>
objective.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Countries like Cuba are isolated by politicians (lobbied by big</i><br>
<i>&gt; enterprises). The Helms-Burton law is the best example. Send enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; planes over there and wait 'til they shoot one. The Helms-Burton law is</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of the strongest economic restrictions world-wide, passed by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "free" country.</i><br>
<p>
All Helms-Burton does is pursue the enforcement of property rights of<br>
former Cuban citizens. The seizure of their property was and still is<br>
unjust and is a major violation of many people's Constitutional and UN<br>
Human Rights. Non-Americans are hypocritically opposed merely for their<br>
own self interest, as they are buying up formerly private property at<br>
firesale prices from the tyrants who confiscated them. Property owners<br>
have an internationally recognized right to be compensated by the new<br>
owners for the property or to have that property returned.<br>
<p>
Helms BUrton is also rather mild, as all it does is not allow executives<br>
and executives' families of corporations that purchase illegally seized<br>
property without copmensating the rightful owners to enter the US. Wah,<br>
wah, you can't go skiing at Vail or visit Disney World, too damn bad.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; They even gave Castro the direct choice to cancel any sanctionations if</i><br>
<i>&gt; he would give up socialism. Of course he didn't. Still Cuba has a low</i><br>
<i>&gt; rate of child mortality and is quite healthy. Compare it to other</i><br>
<i>&gt; non-socialist countries in Latin America and draw your conclusions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Around the world, pure idiots think that they know "better" than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; market, that they can redirect resources better than a pareto optimal</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; free exchange of goods between free people could. Over and over again,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the experiment is done, the people suffer, but the idiots, being pure</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in their lack of mentation, never seem to draw the obvious conclusion</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the facts lead to -- which is that the freer the economy, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; wealthier the people -- even the poorest 10% of the U.S. population</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; look rich compared to the average North Korean, the average Albanian</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; or the average Cuban.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course they don't. Poor US citizens suffer from diseases, hunger and</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminality, much worse than anywhere in Cuba. Albania is another</i><br>
<i>&gt; "reform" country.</i><br>

<i>&gt;                           CHILD AND YOUTH POVERTY</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Child and youth poverty exacerbates the risk behaviors of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      adolescents, and poverty is a growing problem for America's youth</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (Huston, 1992; Lerner, 1993a). By the end of the 1980s</i><br>
<i>&gt;      approximately 20% of America's children and adolescents were poor</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1991; Davidson, 1994; Hernandez, 1993; Huston, 1992; Huston, et</i><br>
<i>&gt;      al., in press; Simons, Finlay, &amp; Yang, 1991). Moreover, data in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the 1992 Kids Count Data Book indicate that across the 1980s the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      percentage of children living in poverty in the United States</i><br>
<i>&gt;      increased by 22%. Indeed, this national trend was present in 40</i><br>
<i>&gt;      states, and continues to increase across the nation (Huston,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1992). Furthermore, of the 12 million American children under the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      age of three years, 25% live in poor families (Carnegie</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Corporation of New York, 1994). In addition, whereas the number</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of children under age six years decreased by 10% between 1971 and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1991, the number of poor children in this age group increased by</i><br>
<i>&gt;      60% (Carnegie Corporation of New York, 1994).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Child poverty occurs in all geographic regions of America. In</i><br>
<i>&gt;      fact, the rates of poverty in rural areas of the Unites States</i><br>
<i>&gt;      are as high as those in the inner cities (Huston, 1992; Jensen,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1988). Furthermore, the poverty rates were higher in 1989 in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      rural areas than metropolitan areas for every race</i><br>
<i>&gt;      classification, and poverty rates for rural blacks and Hispanics</i><br>
<i>&gt;      exceeded rates for their central city counterparts. The higher</i><br>
<i>&gt;      rural poverty rate exists despite the fact that the rural poor</i><br>
<i>&gt;      tend to be comprised of two-parent families (slightly more than</i><br>
<i>&gt;      half) where at least one of the parents works (67%), as compared</i><br>
<i>&gt;      to metropolitan poor families (25% twoparent families; 56% with</i><br>
<i>&gt;      at least one parent employed; Committee on Ways and Means,1991);</i><br>
<i>&gt;      moreover, poor families in rural areas receive fewer welfare</i><br>
<i>&gt;      benefits and are less likely to live in states that provide Aid</i><br>
<i>&gt;      to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) (Huston, 1992; Jensen,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1988).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      However, it must be stressed that the probability of being a poor</i><br>
<i>&gt;      child is not equal across racial or ethnic groups. According to</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the 1993 Kids Count Data Book, across the 1987-1991 period the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      average percentage of European American, African American, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Latino children who were poor was 11.4%, 44.1%, and 37.9%,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      respectively. Moreover, among Latino groups, Puerto Rican</i><br>
<i>&gt;      children experienced the highest rate of poverty (40.4%) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Cuban children experienced the lowest rate (19.7%) (U. S. Bureau</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of the Census, 1991). In addition, it should be noted that, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;      reported in 1991 by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Asian children</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and Native American children experienced rates of poverty of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      16.7% and 24.9%, respectively.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      The percentages of children in poverty across the 1987-1991</i><br>
<i>&gt;      period represent increases in the rates of poverty over the last</i><br>
<i>&gt;      10 years for all racial/ethnic groups. For example, from 19791989</i><br>
<i>&gt;      child poverty grew worse by 9% for European Americans, by 5% for</i><br>
<i>&gt;      African Americans, and by 25% for Latinos, respectively (Center</i><br>
<i>&gt;      for the Study of Social Policy, 1993). In terms of absolute</i><br>
<i>&gt;      numbers, data from the 1990 Census indicate that 5.9 million</i><br>
<i>&gt;      European-American children lived in poverty, whereas the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      corresponding numbers of AfricanAmericans, Asian-Americans,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Native-Americans, and Latinos were 3.7 million, 346,000, 260,000,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and 2.4 million, respectively (Children's Defense Fund, 1992).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Given the differential probability that different racial/ethnic</i><br>
<i>&gt;      groups will be poor, it seems clear that policies and programs</i><br>
<i>&gt;      must be culturally sensitive in order to effect change. In other</i><br>
<i>&gt;      words, both policies and the programs associated with them must</i><br>
<i>&gt;      be culturally competent (Lerner, 1995); they must be able to deal</i><br>
<i>&gt;      effectively with the specific history, culture, values, mores,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and meaning systems of the youth and families embedded in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      poverty.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Indeed, the focus on diversity is crucial because, as noted by</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Huston (1992), race is the most striking and disturbing</i><br>
<i>&gt;      distinction between children whose poverty is chronic and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      children for whom poverty is transitory. For instance, Duncan</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (1992) reports data from the Panel Study on Income Dynamics</i><br>
<i>&gt;      indicating that the average African American child in the study</i><br>
<i>&gt;      spent 5.5 years in poverty; in turn, the average non-African</i><br>
<i>&gt;      American child in the study spent only 0.9 years in poverty.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Furthermore, as with race and ethnicity, poverty is not equally</i><br>
<i>&gt;      distributed across age groups. In 1989, about 20% of children</i><br>
<i>&gt;      younger than age 6 years were poor, and the corresponding rate of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      poverty for 6- to 17-year-olds was about 17%. In turn, the rates</i><br>
<i>&gt;      for Americans aged 18 to 64 years, or aged 65 years or older,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      were about 11% and 13%, respectively (Children's Defense Fund,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1992).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      The sequelae of poverty for children and adolescents are</i><br>
<i>&gt;      devastating. Indeed, as Hamburg (1992, p. 48) notes:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;           . . . almost every form of childhood damage is far more</i><br>
<i>&gt;           prevalent among the poor--from increased infant</i><br>
<i>&gt;           mortality, gross malnutrition, recurrent and untreated</i><br>
<i>&gt;           health problems, and child abuse in the early years, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;           education disability, low achievement, delinquency,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           early pregnancy, alcohol and drug abuse, and failure to</i><br>
<i>&gt;           become economically self-sufficient.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Similarly, as Schorr (1988) stresses, poverty creates several</i><br>
<i>&gt;      "rotten outcomes" of youth development. For example, poverty is</i><br>
<i>&gt;      associated with early school failure, with unemployability, with</i><br>
<i>&gt;      long-term welfare dependency, with violent crime, and with</i><br>
<i>&gt;      feelings of hopelessness and despair (McLoyd &amp; Wilson, 1992;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Schorr, 1988, 1992). Furthermore, McLoyd and Wilson (1992) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Klerman (1992) find that poor children live at high risk for low</i><br>
<i>&gt;      self-confidence, conduct problems, depression, and peer conflict.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      In addition, poor children are at risk for encountering severe</i><br>
<i>&gt;      health problems, e.g., infant mortality, lack of immunization</i><br>
<i>&gt;      against common childhood diseases, and physical abuse, neglect,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and unintended injury (Carnegie Corporation of New York, 1994;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      McLoyd &amp; Wilson, 1992).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Moreover, as compared to their nonpoor age-mates, poor youth: Are</i><br>
<i>&gt;      50% more likely to have physical or mental disability; are almost</i><br>
<i>&gt;      twice as likely to have not visited a doctor or dentist in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      most recent two years of their lives; are 300% more likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;      high school dropouts; and are significantly more likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;      victims of violence (Simons, et al., 1991). In addition, several</i><br>
<i>&gt;      familial risk factors are associated both with child poverty and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      with a key covariate of poverty--poor school achievement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      To illustrate, there are three maternal risk factors associated</i><br>
<i>&gt;      with a child's living in poverty and, as well, with him or her</i><br>
<i>&gt;      being in the lower half of his or her school class. These risk</i><br>
<i>&gt;      factors are: (1) The mother has fewer than 12 years of schooling;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (2) The mother is not married to the child's father; and (3) The</i><br>
<i>&gt;      mother was less than 20 years old when she had her first child.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      These risk factors affect family life and child development. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;      linkage can be illustrated by reference to other 1993 Kids Count</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Data Book information linking these three risk factors to child</i><br>
<i>&gt;      poverty and to school achievement. Among all 7 to 12 year-old</i><br>
<i>&gt;      children living in America, there was a probability of .79 that</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the child would be poor if all three risk factors were present.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Similarly, the probability of being in the lower half of one's</i><br>
<i>&gt;      school class was .58 if all these three factors were present. In</i><br>
<i>&gt;      turn, when any two of these risk factors were present the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      probability of being poor or of being in the bottom half of one's</i><br>
<i>&gt;      school class was .48 and .53, respectively. The corresponding</i><br>
<i>&gt;      probabilities involving the presence of only one risk factor were</i><br>
<i>&gt;      .26 and .47 respectively. Finally, when none of these risk</i><br>
<i>&gt;      factors were present the probability of 7- to 12-year old</i><br>
<i>&gt;      children being poor or being in the lower half of their class was</i><br>
<i>&gt;      .08 and .30, respectively.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Across the 1980s, the probability increased that there would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;      link between child poverty and the presence of maternal risk</i><br>
<i>&gt;      factors. That is, as the poverty rates of America's children</i><br>
<i>&gt;      worsen, exceeding now all other major industrialized nations</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (Huston, 1992), the structure of the family is also changing in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      ways that have placed poor children and parents at greater risk</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of problems of family life and individual development. For</i><br>
<i>&gt;      instance, during the 1980s there was a 13% increase in the number</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of children living in single-parent families, a trend present in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      44 states. Thus, during 1987-1991 period, 18.1%, 30% and 56.7% of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      European-American, Latino, and African-American children,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      respectively, lived in single-parent households (Center for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Study of Social Policy, 1992). Overall, approximately 25% of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      America's youth live in single parent (and, typically,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      female-headed) families, and poverty rates among female-headed,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      single parent or male-headed, single parent families are much</i><br>
<i>&gt;      higher (46.8% and 23.2%, respectively) than among two-parent</i><br>
<i>&gt;      families (9.0%) (Center for the Study of Social Policy, 1993;</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Hernandez, 1993). Indeed, the poverty rates in singleparent</i><br>
<i>&gt;      households were, by the beginning of the 1990s, 29.8% for</i><br>
<i>&gt;      European American families, 50.6% for African American families,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and 53% for Latino families (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1991).</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Since the income of female-headed, single-parent households is</i><br>
<i>&gt;      often three or more times lower than two parent households, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      is also lower than single parent, male-headed households, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      fact that increasing numbers of children live in these family</i><br>
<i>&gt;      structures means that the financial resources to support</i><br>
<i>&gt;      parenting are less likely to be available (Center for the Study</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of Social Policy, 1993).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Moreover, in 1990, 90.3% of children were living with their</i><br>
<i>&gt;      parents, 7.3% were living with other relatives, and 2.3% were</i><br>
<i>&gt;      living outside of the family (Center for the Study of Social</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Policy, 1992). However, only 41.9% of African American children,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      67.7% of Latino children, and 78.5% of European American children</i><br>
<i>&gt;      between the ages of 10 and 14 lived with both their parents</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (Simons, Finlay, &amp; Yang, 1991). In turn, between the ages of 15</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and 17, only 41% , 63%, and 76% of African-American, Latino, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      European American children, respectively, lived in two-parent</i><br>
<i>&gt;      households (Simons, et al., 1991).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      As a means to summarize the costs--not only to youth but, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;      well, to all of America--of pervasive child and adolescent</i><br>
<i>&gt;      poverty, we may note Hamburg's (1992, p. 10) view that:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;           Not only are many more children growing up in poverty</i><br>
<i>&gt;           than was the case a decade or two ago, but many more</i><br>
<i>&gt;           are mired in persistent, intractable poverty with no</i><br>
<i>&gt;           realistic hope of escape. They are profoundly lacking</i><br>
<i>&gt;           in constructively oriented social-support networks to</i><br>
<i>&gt;           promote their education and health. They have very few</i><br>
<i>&gt;           models of competence. They are bereft of visible</i><br>
<i>&gt;           economic opportunity. The fate of these young people is</i><br>
<i>&gt;           not merely a tragedy for them, but for the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt;           nation: A growing fraction of our potential work force</i><br>
<i>&gt;           consists of seriously disadvantaged people who will</i><br>
<i>&gt;           have little if any prospect of acquiring the necessary</i><br>
<i>&gt;           competence to revitalize the economy. If we cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt;           bring ourselves to feel compassion for these young</i><br>
<i>&gt;           people on a personal level, we must at least recognize</i><br>
<i>&gt;           that our economy and our society will suffer along with</i><br>
<i>&gt;           them. Their loss is our loss.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Reform Coupled with Creative and Integrative Programming</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [Image]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Given the number of children and families that today are at such</i><br>
<i>&gt;      profound levels of risk, we are faced as a society with a crisis</i><br>
<i>&gt;      so broad that the entire fabric of American society is in serious</i><br>
<i>&gt;      jeopardy (Simons, et al., 1991). With so many of our nation's</i><br>
<i>&gt;      communities facing the likelihood of losing much of their next</i><br>
<i>&gt;      generation to one or more of the several high risk behaviors</i><br>
<i>&gt;      increasingly present among our nation's youth, all of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;      children, whether or not they themselves engage in given risk</i><br>
<i>&gt;      behaviors, nevertheless in effect live in risk--of experiencing</i><br>
<i>&gt;      the adverse economic and employment conditions associated with</i><br>
<i>&gt;      living in a nation that is increasingly globally uncompetitive,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      has a diminished pool of future leaders, offers lowered standards</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of living, requires lower expectations about life chances and, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;      fact, provides fewer and fewer opportunities for healthy and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      wholesome development (Lerner,1993a).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Simply, America is wasting its most precious resource: The human</i><br>
<i>&gt;      capital represented by its children (Hamburg, 1992; Lerner,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      1993a, 1993b; Lerner &amp; Miller, 1993). And this destruction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      human capital is a problem that cuts across race, ethnicity,</i><br>
<i>&gt;      gender, and rural or urban environments (Center for the Study of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Social Policy, 1992, 1993; Simons, Finlay, &amp; Yang, 1991).</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Accordingly, all of us, all Americans, and certainly all of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;      children and adolescents, are now and for the foreseeable future</i><br>
<i>&gt;      confronted by this crisis of youth development. Of course, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      pervasiveness of this crisis does not diminish the need to</i><br>
<i>&gt;      prioritize our efforts, In fact, results of evaluation studies of</i><br>
<i>&gt;      preventive interventions indicate that great success can occur</i><br>
<i>&gt;      with programs directed to youth and families most in need</i><br>
<i>&gt;      (Dryfoos, 1990, 1994, in press; Hamburg, 1992; Schorr, 1988).</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Nevertheless, the breadth of the problems affecting our nation's</i><br>
<i>&gt;      youth requires that we see the issues we face as pertaining to</i><br>
<i>&gt;      all of us, and not to only a segment or a subgroup of America.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Unfortunately, however, current public policies, and the programs</i><br>
<i>&gt;      associated with them, have proven insufficient to eradicate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      growth of behavioral risks and of poverty and its sequelae; as</i><br>
<i>&gt;      such, unless effective policy innovations and new programs are</i><br>
<i>&gt;      introduced American will lose both much of its current generation</i><br>
<i>&gt;      of adults and an even larger proportion of the next generation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      Given the economic and social calamity that such loss will</i><br>
<i>&gt;      engender, it is clear that public policies pertinent to poor</i><br>
<i>&gt;      people must be reconceptualized and redesigned, and that</i><br>
<i>&gt;      innovative and effective youth- and family-serving programs must</i><br>
<i>&gt;      be coupled with these policy changes in order to create and</i><br>
<i>&gt;      sustain the changes in youth and families that will be requisite</i><br>
<i>&gt;      if America is not to fall over the precipice of generational</i><br>
<i>&gt;      destruction.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Thus, welfare reform and creative programming must be seamlessly</i><br>
<i>&gt;      combined to address this urgent national problem. As such, we now</i><br>
<i>&gt;      discuss the key policy issues to which welfare reform must speak</i><br>
<i>&gt;      and to delineate the ways in which Extension--with its existing</i><br>
<i>&gt;      youth- and family-serving programs or with new programming</i><br>
<i>&gt;      initiatives it will undertake--possesses the capacity to be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;      outreach arm of reformed welfare policies focused on the diverse</i><br>
<i>&gt;      needs of our nations children and families.</i><br>
