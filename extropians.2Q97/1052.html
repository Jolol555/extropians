<i>&gt;&gt; I have read that chewable vitamin C (plain ascorbic acid) tablets can etch</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the enamel of your teeth. There are buffered forms of vitamin C out there,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; but I haven't seen chewable tablets that use them.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Oops! Should I use powder mixed with water instead?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;MikeRose</i><br>
<p>
Powder mixed with water or juice is very well absorbed. Loose packed<br>
capsules are also well absorbed, and are obviously more portable. You can<br>
get the buffered vit C in both of these. Neither, of course, are going to do<br>
much for oral cravings. Ester C is the name brand, and there are generics as<br>
well. This form of vit C (calcium polyascorbate) is also claimed to be<br>
bettter absorbed and retained in the body than regular vit C (ascorbic acid).<br>
<p>
I have bought most of my supplements for the past 2 years through The<br>
Vitamin Shoppe. Very good prices and prompt service. I don't have their<br>
phone number handy, but you can order a catalog through their website at<br>
www.vitaminshoppe.com<br>
