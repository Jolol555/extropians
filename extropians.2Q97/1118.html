This is too fascinating; I just can't stop.<br>

Well, "we" (the US and West Germany?) did exacerbate things by quickly<br>
recognizing the freedom of the Croats and Bosnians to secede from<br>
Yugoslavia, a right not granted by most gov'ts to their own people<br>
(officially granted by the Soviet constitution, I think, but do we<br>
believe them?)  "To push arms industry" seems like an odd goal to<br>
allege, however, considering the nice arms embargoes we imposed.<br>

<p>
Doesn't prove much.  A lack of prostitutes could mean that there are no<br>
desperate women.  It could also mean that Cuba's police is much nastier<br>
than our own, and thus more effective at getting rid of public<br>
prostitution.<br>

Is this supposed to address Perry's refutation of your claim that Cuba<br>

  <br>
And the Soviet agression against Afghanistan?  The North Korean or<br>
Vietnamese agressions against their southern halves?  China's agression<br>
against Tibet, and soon probably-nasty-things done to Hong Kong?  The UK<br>
started being nice to Hong Kong rather late, yes; this hardly lets China<br>
off the hook.<br>

War can never be justified?  Hitler should have been allowed to run<br>
Europe?<br>
<p>
Never answered my note about Communist pollution being far worse than<br>
Western, in most places.  Not that we don't have toxic dumps, but they<br>
are localized dumps, not all of Prague, or Poland.  And do you really<br>
think the US has a more concentrated power elite than the Soviet Union<br>
did?  Or North Korea?  That Kohl has as much power as Gorbachev had?<br>
<p>
And if we did, so what?  Life's still happier, freer, and cleaner here<br>
than over there, for ye average person.  But perhaps I've just been<br>
brainwashed by the media, along with all the Cubans risking drowning and<br>
Vietnamese boat people and high-level Soviet defectors (the West doesn't<br>
get to have defectors.  The West has emigrants.)  You of course are<br>
immune to anyone's influence or brainwashing, the noble intellectural<br>
defender of the mindless hoi polloi...<br>

Ok, I can stop.  Ugh.<br>

And even priests were coming to spend some time in it, because of the<br>
collection of religious books.  There were one thousand, two hundred and<br>
eighty-three religious books in there now, each one--according to<br>
itself--the only one any man need ever read.  It was sort of nice to see<br>
them all together. -- Terry Pratchett, _Small Gods_<br>
