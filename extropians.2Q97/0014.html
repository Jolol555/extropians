Let me endorse these responses of Damien's to Zylof.<br>
<i>&gt;May never be an option on Earth.  Banks' Culture was born this way: in</i><br>

<p>
We had a long discussion about this many months ago; certain<br>
activities may no longer be taxed, but taxes in general are quite feasible into<br>
the indefinite future. <br>

I have no idea what you mean here.  Prop 13 in Calif did it by putting<br>
a big taxes on moves.  But the mortgage deduction in general?<br>
