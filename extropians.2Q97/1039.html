In a message dated 97-05-10 00:42:39 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt;Aren't you happy at least for the effect on your brother and parents?&gt;&gt;<br>
<p>
I am neither happy nor sad.  I have too many things in my own life to be<br>
concerned with, to be concerned, or even care, about my brother's situation.<br>
 If I'm not personally involved in any situation, it's really of no concern<br>
to me.  I only have so much attention to go around, and currently, it's<br>
pretty much all on me and my projects.  Besides, my family (every member of<br>
it, practically) are about as different from me as I could imagine.  To me,<br>
mental similarity is more important than genetic similarity.<br>
