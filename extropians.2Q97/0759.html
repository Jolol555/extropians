In a message dated 97-04-29 07:34:27 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; a) Mike Rose, me, did not post the original 'water-car' mail<br>
 2) he dosn't believe the car works<br>
 c) nor does he believe is doen't/couldn't<br>
 iv) he was just interested in the fact that some guy had managed to get<br>
    his 'theory' published, and that the guy must be lying if his opponents<br>
    are correct. The article seemed to say that he rides this car <br>
    regularly.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 I just wanted to know if it was an outright lie, the product of delusion<br>
 or something some people may have missed. Seeing as none of the opponents<br>
 seemed to have read the offending article I am still uncomfortable with<br>
 picking any one of the above.<br>
 <br>
 Thanks....<br>

Yes, he claims that it works, drives the car regularly, even showed it to the<br>
news media (who refused to air it).  He researched hydrogen generators<br>
extensively (not fusion plants, or maybe he did(did not say)), and perfected<br>
a way of making a car run on water.  The article he wrote is actually the<br>
directions on how to make it.  You think they'd publish that if it didnt<br>
work? I dunnOOooo......<br>
