<i>&gt; &gt;This is to sneak in the assumption that the rules of the game include</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the social norms.  In that case, certainly knowing your opponents</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;available choices and likely coices and payoffs is necessary to win</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the game.  But the "rules" of the game of life are not constrained by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;society, only by the nature of reality.  To play a fair game unbound</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;by the shackles of convention requires learning the rules of reality,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;not the rules of society.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're setting a false dichotomy here.  Society is quite "real" and unless</i><br>
<i>&gt; you think you can single-handedly change the rules of society, they are part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of reality.  </i><br>
<p>
The original question posed was along the lines of "What social norms<br>
should we teach our children to prepare them for the coming transhuman<br>
world?", and my answer is "None; teach them how to create their own<br>
norms by giving them the principles from which they derive, and letting<br>
them reason for themselves."<br>
<p>
I recognize that these norms and assumptions are real--all too real,<br>
having just written a check to the IRS.  But that doesn't mean I'm<br>
going to teach my son "pay your taxes", I'm going to teach him "I pay<br>
taxes because the government has a gun to my head, but they are evil,<br>
and I hope you will be able to abolish them in the future and deal<br>
with other people by voluntary exchange instead."  The reason I teach<br>
him this is that I believe it represents reality, even though it may<br>
not be what most people believe.  He will learn the principle, and<br>
then work toward creating norms that reflect it, and maybe work<br>
around the existing ones as I do in the meantime.<br>
<p>
I'm sure there were parents during the time when such social norms<br>
as slavery and enforced gender roles were common who taught their<br>
children that slavery was wrong, and that women had rights.  I admire<br>
them, but I admire even more those who explained /why/ they were wrong,<br>
and gave their children the tools to not only abandon the morally<br>
repulsive norms of their parents, but their own as well.<br>
<p>
I will teach my child that yes, you /can/ single-handedly change the<br>
rules of society, because you have that most marvelous of all tools,<br>
the human mind.  Every advance in society was first imagined by some<br>
individual, communicated to others, validated, championed, and put in<br>
place by the work of individuals.  Your mind has the same abilities<br>
as Francis Bacon's or Thomas Paine's, and you have more information<br>
and experience to draw from, so your decisions can be better than<br>
theirs--and better than mine.  I won't just teach you my ideas, I<br>
will teach you how to find even better ones.<br>
