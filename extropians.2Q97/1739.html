I've just finished reading Dave Chalmer's book The Conscious Mind, which<br>
left me wondering exactly *what* he *is* saying... but I think you've got<br>
it turned around, Hal.  Chalmers' argument for the singular and unreductive<br>
character of consciousness is based firmly on the feasibility of<br>
counterfactual possible worlds which are replete with zombies.  These<br>
critters are identical with us down the quantal level, but lack the<br>
supervenience of consciousness and hence lack `experience' and `qualia' -<br>
even though they claim to have them (being perfect behavioural emulations<br>
of conscious people).  Certainly Dave argues against *us* being zombies -<br>
he rejects the John Clark model, in other words - but his whole argument<br>
hangs on the modal possibility that a zombie world *is* intelligible.  I<br>
don't think it is, in rather the way I don't think it's genuinely possible<br>
to ask the hoary old question `why is there anything rather than nothing?'<br>
I don't think we *can* conceive of the absence of literally *everything*,<br>
just of the absence of certain structures.  The rest is just words,<br>
free-floating and (in such cases) delusive signifiers.<br>
