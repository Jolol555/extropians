	Succinctly put.  All power to the replicators!  Actually that<br>
brings up an interesting point.  Extropianism is in many ways us versus<br>
the current set of replicators.  Human nature often battles DNA and<br>
transhumans will do so even more.  In fact Graham Cairns-Smith proposes<br>
that DNA is in fact a replicator that defeated an earlier more primitive<br>
replicator and that all those arguments about how unlikely it is for life<br>
to have started are unneccessary as a more simple form than now exists<br>
existed before.<br>
