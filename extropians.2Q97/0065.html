<i>&gt; I am currently writing a paper for a sociology class about the ethics</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Transhumanism.  It deals with the ethics of defying evolution to</i><br>
<i>&gt; raise ourselves.  In essence its about Whether we can play god with</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology.</i><br>
<p>
Ethics /is/ a technology, just like language, society, education, and<br>
the paper on which you write about them.  And the very language of the<br>
question is absurd: one can no more "defy evolution" than one can defy<br>
gravity.  Evolution isn't a purpose, it's an effect. <br>
<p>
Evolution (or for that matter whatever other process you postulate<br>
led to the development of species) led to a vast array of creatures<br>
with different abilities and mechanisms for survival.  Our species<br>
has been equipped with a capable mind, and a natural desire to use<br>
it.  Beavers make dams; humans make fire, the wheel, hunting weapons,<br>
clothing, agriculture, government, family structure.<br>
<p>
These things are just as much a part of nature as birds' nests and<br>
anthills.  As we evolve further, each generation learns from the<br>
last about its struggles, its mistakes, its crimes, and creates ways<br>
to overcome them.  The next generation learns from /those/ mistakes<br>
and creates new marvels--and new mistakes.  That continuous struggle<br>
is what we are--what nature itself is.  To choose some single point<br>
in our history and say that the Earth as it existed then is "natural"<br>
and everything since is "artificial" is arbitrary and meaningless.<br>
Was Neanderthal man "natural", with his particular set of tools and<br>
tribal structure?  Were the American Indians "natural" with their<br>
larger nations and religious rituals?  Are the Amish "natural" with<br>
their barn raisings and head cheese?<br>
<p>
The obvious conclusion is that all of them were, as are we, and as<br>
our cybernetic grandkids will be next century.  We're not "playing<br>
God", we're playing human, just as we always have.<br>
