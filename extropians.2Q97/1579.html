Partly it's that we've tried and failed to replace humans with animals in the<br>
routine but abstract purposes we're discussing here (cleaning, caretaking,<br>
machine operation, etc.)  We have a new possibility so we're giving it a go.<br>
 It's worth a try.<br>
<p>
The other advantage to building the agents is that they might be far more<br>
easily duplicated.  Monkeys are cheaper than people, but a well-trained<br>
monkey still requires a lot of investment and upkeep.  Further, animals are<br>
more variable than machines and that doesn't sit well with industrial design<br>
theory, which works hard to minimize nonessential variability.<br>
