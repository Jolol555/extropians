Seconded. Friedman's book is surely the best single source. My own<br>
introduction back in 1981 was Murray Rothbard's For a New Liberty. I'd<br>
still recommend Rothbard as a secondary source. Where he goes wrong is in<br>
expecting all agencies to enforce his libertarian constitution. Friedman<br>
instead applies economic analysis to argue that the agencies would have<br>
incentive leading them to a highly (but not 100%) libertarian result.<br>

I was surprised at Hagbard's unfamiliarity with anarcho-capitalism. I took<br>
it that the original Hagbard Celine (my favorite character in Shea and<br>
Wilson's Illuminatus!) was an anarcho-capitalist. That book has a special<br>
place with me, since it's the first place I ever heard of libertarian<br>
ideas. I thought, to my frustration, that they were only fictional until I<br>
came across an ad for The Alternative Bookshop in London. In 1981 I sent an<br>
inquiry to them and received a bunch of leaflets with titles like "Taxation<br>
is Theft". I bought For a New Liberty, then Nozick's Anarchy, State, and<br>
Utopia and was hooked! (At that time the number of libertarians in England<br>
probably didn't exceed 300.)<br>
<p>
Apart from introducing me to anarcho-capitalism through the fictional<br>
Hagbard, I have to thank Robert Anton Wilson for first showing me that<br>
cryonics was done for real, through the sad story of his daughter Luna's<br>
suspension in Cosmic Trigger. Anyone else find their way to these ideas<br>
through Wilson?<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
