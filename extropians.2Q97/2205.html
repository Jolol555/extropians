<i>&gt; From: Michael Lorrey &lt;retroman@tpk.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps they have a more evolved aesthetic sense than you. Perhaps they</i><br>
<i>&gt; value the diversity of variously independently evolve intelligences more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than some eventual cosmic dissolution. Given that the stars in our sky</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been probably the most inspirational thing in history, taking that</i><br>
<i>&gt; sight away from millions of possible intelligent races is in my opinion</i><br>
<i>&gt; a huge crime, not only that, but those races caught on a planet inside a</i><br>
<i>&gt; dyson sphere would eventually be baked to death, so not only does this</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean the death of inspiration, but the death of innumerable</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligences. Perhaps they know of a way out of this universe for</i><br>
<i>&gt; advanced races to follow to avoid the end of this one. Perhaps they</i><br>
<i>&gt; value the pace of evolution races will take from matter based to energy</i><br>
<i>&gt; based organisms. There are many possible answers to Fermi's Paradox that</i><br>
<i>&gt; still leave open the possibility for other intelligent species.</i><br>
<p>
	It could be that stars are simply not an efficient energy source.  Already<br>
humans have hypothesized about energy sources that require new physics. <br>
Zero point energy comes to mind.  Why would anyone bother surrounding a sun<br>
with a sphere when they could get more energy out of the space contained in<br>
a light bulb?  There could be many more sources of energy in the universe,<br>
and they could be found in a billion years, than stars and if matter is<br>
scarce it would not be economical to surround a star.  If matter is not<br>
scarce, as the state of the universe would show, even the general outlines<br>
of the advanced race defy comprehension.<br>
