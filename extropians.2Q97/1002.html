I'm also not sure it is valid.  It is a common fallacy in thinking about<br>
evolution to suggest that it can produce anything.  There are two<br>
limitations to those things that evolution can produce. One is that<br>
everything has to come about through step by step changes, each step<br>
providing an advantage for survival.  The second is really a more specific<br>
form of the first.  Development has to permit the change. I'll use the eye<br>
again.  <br>
	The photo receptors in the eye are wired backwards.  The part of the cell<br>
that receives light is located behind the nucleus and the mitochondria and<br>
the dendrite(?) the sends the data to the optic nerve.  This results in<br>
(most likely very slight) reduction in vision.  The current eye that we<br>
have now is so ingrained in the genome that there could be no change of<br>
this magnitude because it would conflict with other developmental<br>
processes.<br>
