Hi.<br>
<p>
In response to the investment thread of a month or so back, I have been<br>
working on an investment &amp; business website.  Due to my very busy schedule,<br>
it probably won't be finished until sometime around Extro3.  <br>
<p>
The site will have sections on Investing, Entrepreneurship, Tax Shelters<br>
and Asset Protection, <br>
Economics (Trends, Forecasts, &amp; Theoretical), and Business.  The site isn't<br>
intended as a static resource and will have forms and tools that directly<br>
support the different sections. <br>
<p>
I just wanted to let the large number of interested people know that<br>
something is underway, although it may take me a bit to finish it.  I will<br>
post previews with the URL when it is closer to completion.<br>
<p>
<p>
