I read an article (in Fortune, I think) that warned investors to be careful<br>
with index funds based on the Dow or the S&amp;P 500. The writer noted that<br>
these stocks may be overvalued because index investing has become so<br>
incredibly popular that these stocks just keep getting pushed up. The<br>
writer suggested broader index funds, such as those based on the Wilshire<br>
5000. I'd be very interested to hear comments on this.<br>

Yes, if only I'd known more about Dell a year ago...<br>
<p>
Warren Buffett's approach makes a lot of sense to me. It's too bad that he<br>
doesn't know much about high tech and so won't invest in that area. My one<br>
and only investment so far (Coca Cola) was inspired by Buffett, though I<br>
think I should have gone with Microsoft, as I almost did but it's price was<br>
relatively high at the time. I'm happy so far though: I bought my few<br>
shares of stock a month ago. It's up 13%, so I can boast -- for now! -- of<br>
an annualized return of 156%.<br>
<p>
Given a Buffett approach, perhaps an investment club could serve as a way<br>
of spreading expert knowledge on particular companies among people in the<br>
group. Of course there is no guarantee that someone who claims to be an<br>
expert on Company ! really is an expert, but this might be a reasonably way<br>
of figuring out which stocks to pick, when you're not satisfied with boring<br>
but sensible index funds.<br>
<p>
For those who haven't come across it, I recommend Microsoft Investor as a<br>
fine way to keep track of investments. Unfortunately, while expanding its<br>
features, Microsoft are about to start charging $9.95 per month for it.<br>
