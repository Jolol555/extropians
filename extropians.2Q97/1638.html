<p>
<i>&gt; Looking into the future as a follow up to Mark's interesting point, which</i><br>
is<br>
<i>&gt;  also discussed in Wired October 1994 issue, how and through what medium </i><br>
<i>&gt; would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the Extropians go about uploading our human brains to say a Web site on</i><br>
the<br>
<i>&gt;  Internet-- in mere bit/byte PET Scans mappings, or actual cryonic DNA </i><br>
<i>&gt; through</i><br>
<i>&gt;  molecular computing or nanotechnology as some Extropians propose?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  For sake of argument, if Mark is corrrect that "...consciousness is a</i><br>
state<br>
<i>&gt;  in the machine; an emergent property of the network...", and assuming that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  every Internet user uploaded their brain's DNA, would that result in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  "Collective Extrophic Consciousness" or "Collective cyber/molecular brain</i><br>
<i>&gt;  mass"  as such, beyond our mere brains per se?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Or, is it possible that our "Collective Consciousness" is beyond something</i><br>
<i>&gt;  material and genetic-- the spiritual, the eternal, yes the soul--</i><br>
<i>&gt;  apocryphally speaking?  Would that mean there may be the after-life beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt;  this physical world?</i><br>
<p>
Surely simulating DNA would not have any advantage over real DNA (would the<br>
system used to simulate it be smaller than the DNA itself?)  This is one of<br>
the things that I never understand about uploading, what advantage does it<br>
offer?<br>
<p>
If I wanted to simulate myself, how much of me would I need to simulate?<br>
 Just the brain paterns? or would I have to simulate everything?  Surely if I<br>
simulate something in every possible detail, the simulation would be larger<br>
and slower than the original.  Would my uploaded self be free from the<br>
effects of time, or does information have to represented by something<br>
physical? (and could we represent it by something more efficient than the<br>
original?)<br>
<p>
All information describes something physical, therefore the physical object<br>
takes less space than the description (when the description is of<br>
*everything* concerning the physical object, and the information has to be<br>
represented by something physical).  Existing as pure information would be<br>
less efficient than existing as the thing we create information about.<br>
