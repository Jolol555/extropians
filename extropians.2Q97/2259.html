John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; responded:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I agree, except my intelligence has always concluded that all</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence is abstract.  What on earth would non abstract</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence be like?</i><br>
<p>
	Most "representations" are abstract.  Any physical phenomenon<br>
that can assume a distinguishable state can model or represent other<br>
phenomenon or represent information.  But, though a representation can<br>
"abstractly" model or represent other physical phenomenon if the two<br>
are not the same fundamental physical phenomenon that is all they are<br>
is abstract representations of each other.  They are not fundamentally<br>
precisely the same.  Only identical physical phenomenon can perfectly<br>
model every single quality and attribute of another.  The identical<br>
physical phenomenon is more than an abstract representation, it is the<br>
phenomenon.  There is nothing else precisely like it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see nothing different in the slightest. You will treat this post</i><br>
<i>&gt; much the same if you read it off a cathode ray tube, a liquid</i><br>
<i>&gt; crystal screen, listen to it with a voice synthesizer or print it on</i><br>
<i>&gt; a dead tree.</i><br>
<p>
	The cognitive content or meaning, yes.  But the sensations<br>
representing color text on a cathode ray tube are drastically<br>
different than the sensations of hearing a voice synthesizer read it.<br>
I'm not talking about the cognitive meaning, I'm talking about the<br>
differences between the conscious physical sensations themselves.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Yes, but why wouldn't the same thing be true of a machine, after</i><br>
<i>&gt; all, a machine can have a favorite color too.</i><br>
<p>
	A future machine, endowed with the ability to feel differing<br>
sensations of differing intrinsic value like we can, yes, but a<br>
current abstract machine no.  An abstract machine's "favorite" color<br>
would simply be an arbitrary abstract representation or a setting of a<br>
bit, not having anything to do with the fundamental value of any<br>
actual feeling or the actual nature of the way the bit is represented.<br>
When we try to figure out our favorite color we don't consult the<br>
setting of some abstract bit like an abstract machine must, we try to<br>
emotionally feel the various color sensations and see which is of most<br>
value to us.  Then we set an abstract bit of information representing<br>
our discovery and communicate this as our favorite color.<br>
<p>
	A red sensation has much more intrinsic value than a pain<br>
sensation produced by a burnt finger.  The drastic difference between<br>
the value of these two representations would have to be abstractly<br>
programmed into an abstract machine.  This is a much more difficult,<br>
less reliable, and less meaningful proposition than the powerfully<br>
intrinsic value our subjective representations we naturally have<br>
without requiring such additional brittle programming and abstract<br>
specification.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A red quale in isolation is meaningless if all light produced a red</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensation then color would signify nothing. The red color only has</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaning if there is contrast, if there are other colors that are not</i><br>
<i>&gt; red to compare it to.</i><br>
<p>
	No!  I would much rather only be able to feel a single red<br>
sensation (and no other color sensation) than to have all my<br>
representations be completely abstract and valueless.  True, there<br>
must be distinguishable physical diversity before it can abstractly<br>
represent information, but red, all by itself is intrinsically very<br>
emotionally wonderful and valuable. It is fundamentally like something<br>
and this something is of great value.  Have you never heard of the<br>
blind person that could only remember a patch of blue and how they<br>
cherished that memory even though they could no longer really<br>
experience or remember any other seeing experience?  Are you denying<br>
the existence of such "isolated" meaning and/or value?<br>
<p>
	Also, we know there is much more in the electromagnetic<br>
spectrum than just the visible slice.  Yet we know what our<br>
representations of this visible spectrum are like without having<br>
anything to represent the majority of wavelengths outside of this very<br>
narrow spectrum.  Some day we may discover other as yet unexperienced<br>
quale and be able to use these to represent other than the visible<br>
spectrum just like we use our current color qualia to abstractly<br>
represent the visible spectrum.  We do not require such additional<br>
contrasting qualia to know what red is like.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you also changed my memory of those colors or made the switch the</i><br>
<i>&gt; day I was born then my behavior today would be no different, just</i><br>
<i>&gt; like the machine.</i><br>
<p>
	Your behavior would be no different but your representation of<br>
red would still be different and not like what it would have been<br>
otherwise.  Once we objectively know what red is we will be able to<br>
observe which of us have different phenomenal representations for 700<br>
nm light.  At least some of us (color blind people) use different<br>
qualia to represent different wavelengths of light.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You say my subjective experience would be different but give no</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence to support your claim.</i><br>
<p>
	Are you claiming that your subjective experience would be<br>
identical since your behavior could be identical whether you wear<br>
color inverting glasses or not?  If such an absurd notion is what you<br>
are claiming this is where the burden of proof should lie I would<br>
think.  You should try putting on some colored glasses some day and<br>
see how different things feel even though you can still walk and so<br>
forth.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You'll have to take my word for it but I am not a machine, I am a</i><br>
<i>&gt; human, but I can not answer what the sensations of red and blue are</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I'm quite sure you can do no better.</i><br>
<p>
	Precisely!  we can't YET eff.  We don't yet objectively know<br>
what color is.  We only know subjectively within our own subjective<br>
world what it is and is not like.  The only information we can now<br>
know about things outside our subjective spirit world is only abstract<br>
information gathered by our senses and represented by our sensations.<br>
We don't yet have the scientific understanding nor technical ability<br>
to eff.  But this is coming.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Knowledge is an abstract quantity. Knowledge of anything is abstract.</i><br>
<p>
	As I said before, an identical duplicate of a physical<br>
phenomenon is more than just "knowledge of" or a "model of" a physical<br>
behavior, it is the same physical phenomenon.  This kind of real, non<br>
abstract, knowledge is the best kind of knowledge and the only real or<br>
non abstract knowledge.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You don't really think the debate on this issue will EVER come to an</i><br>
<i>&gt; end do you?</i><br>
<p>
	Why would you ever lack the faith that we can figure it out?<br>
What evidence is there that says it is any more difficult than any<br>
other physical phenomenon we now finally understand?  It's just a bit<br>
more complex, and we have this troubling misperception that green is<br>
either something that doesn't exist or that it is something, not in<br>
our brain, but something on the surface of a leaf of a tree.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; OK, it's the year 2525 and you have just thought up a bright shiny</i><br>
<i>&gt; new theory explaining exactly what subjective experience is all</i><br>
<i>&gt; about.  How do I know if it's even approximately correct?</i><br>
<p>
	Just like any other law of physics: it accurately predicts<br>
what is occuring and enables us to control it.  If we objectively and<br>
reliably know that a particular neural corelate (as Crick likes to<br>
call it) corresponds to a salty sensation then we will know if two<br>
people use the same sensation to represent the taste of salt by<br>
whether or not there is the identical neural corelate.  If someone<br>
uses a different than normal neural corelate to represent the taste of<br>
salt with a different corresponding subjective quale, then we will<br>
also be able to alter their neural wiring, give the proper stimulus,<br>
and according to the newly discovered physical laws of consciousness<br>
reliably tell or predict to them: "This sensation you are about to<br>
feel is what most people use to represent a salty taste."  "Boy,<br>
that's not what salt tastes like to me!" they would likely feel after<br>
the experience.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; No you're incorrect, that's not what salt tastes like to me at all,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's not even close. Prove I'm right. Prove I'm wrong.</i><br>
<p>
	Once we have the proper physical understanding such - proof,<br>
or at least reliable demonstration, will be the results.  That is all<br>
I'm saying.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Brent Allsop is an intelligent fellow but he is not conscious, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact, all human beings are conscious, except Brent Allsop. Brent has</i><br>
<i>&gt; some pitiful little thing he calls consciousness, but compared to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the glorious subjective experience every other human has it's the</i><br>
<i>&gt; difference between a firefly and a supernova.  Prove I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt; right. Prove I'm wrong.</i><br>
<p>
	Solipsism and anything like this can't yet be proved wrong,<br>
given our current understanding and technical ability, there is only<br>
evidence or occam's razor.  But I'm betting all this stuff will be<br>
proved wrong (or right) shortly when we finally discover what, why,<br>
and how all this phenomenal stuff that is so full of value and meaning<br>
in our mind is.  We could achieve such understanding much faster if we<br>
would stop claiming it is nothing or looking for it in the wrong place<br>
beyond our senses or giving up in despair thinking it can't be done.<br>
It's not that difficult if you just think about it in the proper<br>
representational way.<br>
<p>
	As Crick Argues in his book, we are about to discover all<br>
this.  This will be the most significant immortalizing and world<br>
changing discovery made by mankind to date.  We will finally be able<br>
to understand the answer to the question: "What am I?"; to answer your<br>
questions; to eff; to be able to disprove solipsism..., and to finally<br>
understand that we will be able to escape from this isolated and<br>
lonely spirit prison inside our mortal skull and what will be required<br>
and what it will really mean and feel like to do such.<br>
