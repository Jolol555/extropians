This has been posted to the technocracy list, as a reply to my request<br>
regarding the goals of technocracy.  Could somebody please comment on<br>
these guys' approach validity? I know that the loss of jobs due to<br>
automation problem is real, probably forcing us to do some (discriminate!)<br>
wealth redistribution over long. However, I somehow fail to see how below<br>
approach should solve any problems at all...<br>

<p>
Hello Karpal -- or Eugene Leitl -- or whoever.  Do you know zero about<br>
Technocracy???  I know you can access their website at<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/technocracy">http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/technocracy</a> if you haven't read any of this<br>
for all their official statements, but putting it my own words, what<br>
Technocracy would be about is THE ANSWER to North America's [and<br>
eventually our planet's] financial fiscal crises -- which have grown<br>
worse with fifty years on Red Ink-o-nomics of WW II.<br>
<p>
Technocracy's goal is to aid in the GREAT SWITCHOVER from fiscal<br>
accounting of GNP to energy accounting system of ECO*nomics --<br>
calculating everything in actual quantity produced by the amount of<br>
energy [KWTS, ergs, BTU's instead of IOU's] on a total and a per capita<br>
so that everyone in a geographic area would be supplied plenty of the<br>
Earth's natural resources as well as those manufactured.<br>
<p>
The BIG DIFFERENCE in today's manufacture, as well as agriculture, from<br>
a century ago is the use of sophisticated technology instead of muscle<br>
power -- especially with the 20th century's advent of KWTS -- and yet<br>
we're still trying to price people when they perform only 2% of the<br>
labor of today's world of push buttons and automation.<br>
<p>
To sum it up -- The Summit of Eight are meeting in Denver to try a<br>
fiscal fix when our real problem is perpetuating the PRICE/PROFIT SYSTEM<br>
which perpetuates pollution and poverty -- while Wall Street and<br>
Washington are going crazy on IOU's, the rest of are trying to survive<br>
alive on the WAGE GUAGE which actually rations food/ housing/ medical<br>
care / education instead of equitably calculating HOW MUCH STUFF VS HOW<br>
MUCH POPULATION.<br>
<p>
I know I'm putting this in simple terms, but Technocracy's goal is to<br>
help implement this DESIGN which was developed by 300 top researchers<br>
who took INVENTORY of North America's resources and minerals to see if<br>
we could support our INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION which tends to gobble up<br>
resources much faster than the 19th century hand-tool pace.<br>
<p>
THE PROBLEM IS -- in Six Decades of publications, lectures and meetings,<br>
not many Americans seem to understand what Technocracy is all about.<br>
<p>
Just last week President Clinton in San Diego was talking about equality<br>
of races -- whereas the DESIGN of a Technate of The Americas would<br>
assure more equality than any money system ever has or could -- for<br>
everyone would be assured their share [by choice not price] of whatever<br>
our GNP would be in consumables and housing would no longer be by<br>
mortgage -- so everyone would enjoy the best quality and most<br>
sustainable.<br>
<p>
You refer to Hayek and I've, for many years, received THE FREEMAN<br>
economics journal [which is not about economics but financial] and Hayek<br>
is discussing ways to make the dollarsign system work -- when the actual<br>
fact is that KWTS changed forever the way people and machines WORK --<br>
yet we're still attempting to price everything as if we're all still on<br>
the farms and making stuff by hand -- which we aren't.<br>
<p>
Did you just recently come into the Technocrat/Technocracy loop?  <br>
<p>
In simple terms, Technocracy proposes MEASUREMENT by quantity instead of<br>
PRICE -- I just spoke with a man this morning about how many KWTS his<br>
household consumes and he couldn't tell me except in dollarsigns.  It's<br>
awfully hard to get folks to think in terms of quantity instead of<br>
price.<br>
<p>
Entirely different from politics [which takes money and lots of it] the<br>
physical lines of production crossed in 1913 [Chart on Brief No. 28]<br>
going upward while the number of hours to produce unit of product went<br>
downward from 14 hours a day to what we promote now -- and had zero to<br>
do with who was President or banking -- these are physical facts.<br>
<p>
There are INFLECTION POINTS in pig iron or automobiles where things take<br>
an S-curve -- CEO Andrew Grove of INTEL Corp. told Commonwealth Club<br>
several years ago that when INTEL hit the Inflection Point he had to lay<br>
off not the usual 10% but a third of their workers and close down a<br>
third of their plant.  [and IBM was hoping Intel would take over some of<br>
their closed factories...no way.]<br>
<p>
His message to the Commonwealth Club and to AMERICA, was that AMEERICA<br>
has now reached its inflection point.<br>
<p>
I'd like to see the Citizens rise up peacefully with a CITIZENS' BALLOT<br>
for a new accounting system based on Technocracy's Energy Accounting<br>
which has all been researched before we were born -- based on a DESIGN<br>
which would prove ecologically sustainable -- for we all recognize that<br>
our present M.O.N.E.Y. SYSTEM of Man-ipulating Of Nation's Economic<br>
Yield as if there is not enough to go around, is not equitable and<br>
doesn't consider some people as human beings deserving of even a roof<br>
over their heads or appropriate food let alone education unless you can<br>
afford $25,000 and cerdtainly health care becomes prohibitive for 40<br>
millions.<br>
<p>
What do YOU see as a better way to IMPLEMENT the best of what has<br>
already been designed for North Americans to live well, but not as<br>
wastefully?<br>
<p>
Where do you fit into all this?  JQS<br>
