The problem with gas turbines, even if you buffer the energy like you<br>
describe above, is that they are inefficient in city driving environments.<br>
A car driving on surface streets or rush hour traffic spends most of its<br>
time at idle or near idle.  If your commute is anything like mine, your<br>
small battery buffer would become full quite quickly, forcing you to idle<br>
the turbine.  Since idling turbines are horribly inefficient, I suspect the<br>
actual savings from this configuration would minimal.  If we applied<br>
turbine technology to highway driving, then you would see significant gains<br>
in efficiency, but in this instance you don't really need the electrical<br>
conversion anyway.<br>
<p>
I've driven a turbine powered car before, and they are very nice.  Lots of<br>
power and very smooth acceleration.  Supposedly some company is working on<br>
a prototype turbine that can idle nearly as efficiently as a vanilla<br>
internal combustion engine.  Turbines actually make a lot of sense if you<br>
are looking for a lot of power in a compact package.  The turbine car that<br>
I drove put out in excess of 600 horsepower, but was as fuel efficient as<br>
most sports cars in the 400 horsepower range.<br>
