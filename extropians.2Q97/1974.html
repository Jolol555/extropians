<i>&gt;  Nothing caused the first cause, otherwise it wouldn't be the first cause.</i><br>

..or the first cause was nothing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  	&gt;But nothing you could observe after that initial cause is random.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  	     </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Why not? If event B has no cause it just means that there does not exist</i><br>
an <br>
<i>&gt;  event A such that if I see  A I am certain to see B. There is nothing </i><br>
<i>&gt;  obviously illogical about that and modern experimental results seem to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  confirm the possibility.</i><br>
<p>
Describe to me a random event, any event that you (or anyone else) believes<br>
to be completely random..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  	&gt;I would also argue that the initial cause was not random, because I</i><br>
       <br>
<i>&gt;  	&gt;don't believe that random events exist.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  		   </i><br>
<i>&gt;  If it was not random that means it had a cause so it can't be the initial</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  cause. Either some things are random or, if you want to preserve</i><br>
determinism,<br>
<i>&gt;  there in an infinite chain of cause and effect and no initial cause.</i><br>
<p>
An infinite chain of cause and effect would do nicely.  I doubt it is exactly<br>
this, but it's the closest we can percieve, being a part of the universe<br>
means we can never be an outside observer and thus never understand it fully.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  If the Copenhagen interpretation is correct then information can not exist</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  without consciousness and consciousness can not exist without information,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  this certainly doesn't lead to your conclusion that only meat can be </i><br>
<i>&gt;  conscious.</i><br>
<p>
I believe that any machine, meat or otherwise, that is adaptive has some form<br>
of consciousness.  Adaptive meaning that it processes information and alters<br>
itself to it's surroundings accordingly.  That includes people, dogs, apes,<br>
plants and even some computers.  The only problems I can see are with<br>
consciousness as software, i'm unsure as to the level of abstraction possible<br>
(can we save consciousness as a set of rules or do we need to simulate every<br>
last atom).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  	&gt;If you uploaded your consciouness you would no longer be conscious</i><br>
        <br>
<i>&gt;  	&gt;because you would no longer have a physical world on which to         </i><br>
<i>&gt;  	&gt;accumilate information.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  	   </i><br>
<i>&gt;  We accumulate information from our senses, process it with our brain and  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  store in into memory, we also take old data from memory, reprocess it, and</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  return it to memory, an Upload would do exactly the same thing.</i><br>
<p>
I withdraw that comment, even if we do not simulate a physical world, we can<br>
adapt ourselves to percieve computer data, information, etc. in much the same<br>
way as we percieve physical things now.<br>
