The recent thread about wearable devices brought to mind something I'd<br>
thought about before: it has already been shown that when blind people<br>
are fitted with a head-mounted camera that reproduces its image onto a<br>
grid of tactors on the subject's belly or back, the subject adapts to<br>
his new "vision" easily, and the brain relocates the subjective image<br>
to the camera, regardless of where the tactor array is placed (for<br>
example, when an object is thrown at the subject, he reflexively ducks<br>
in the right direction, even if the tactors are on his back).<br>
<p>
It seems obvious to me that the next thing to try is a normally sighted<br>
subject.  Mount a small camera--say infrared--on a pair of glasses,<br>
feeding to a tactor grid.  Wouldn't the subject then be likely to adapt<br>
his subjective vision experience to include the new infrared data?  We<br>
could call them "LaForge Glasses" :-)<br>
