1) Legislators and their staffs are paid from funds which are coerced by <br>
the taxpayers.  So the very act of legislating, as it is currently <br>
practiced in most locations, has everything to do with coercion and would <br>
be impossible _without_ coercion.  (Obviously this does does not include <br>
legislators who work for free, or who are funded [legally] from other <br>
non-coercive sources, but I'm not aware that such people exist.)<br>
<p>
2) In the United States, the Executive branch is prohibited  by the <br>
Constitution from making laws.  Therefore, if legislators didn't write <br>
laws, bureaucrats wouldn't have regulations to enforce.  So again, <br>
legislators play a crucial role in the coercive cycle of politics.<br>

Dear John and other fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
There is a substantial doubt in my mind as to whether our tax system is a<br>
legitimate form of coercion and whether it follows that all forms of<br>
governmental action are therefore based on coercion.<br>
<p>
The concept as stated seems far to simplistic to dignify except through<br>
sophistry, and ignores the numerous -- and real -- contingency factors that<br>
exist in the formulating policy and applying these contingencies to the<br>
legislative process. <br>
<p>
The contingency factors I refer to are the inputs involved in formulating<br>
policy from the various interest groups. In many instances these interest<br>
groups have legitimate needs. <br>
<p>
Obviously, some interest groups are wholly self serving and have no<br>
interests beyond their own selfish needs. In these instances a<br>
counteractive filtering process takes place to take as many non-considered<br>
factors under advisement in order to provide greater equity in the<br>
formulation of a policy. Indeed, this does not always work the way we would<br>
like. <br>
<p>
No system is perfect. The object is to keep as open a mind as is possible<br>
and encourage the development of an ever greater paradigm that can be<br>
applied to the betterment of the human condition. Within such a framework<br>
all things can be considered and integrated to the extent that they have a<br>
constructive effect on an increasingly literate and slowly evolving<br>
society.<br>
<p>
