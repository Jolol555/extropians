<p>
Some facts are so simple and obvious that somehow they get <br>
overlooked.<br>
<p>
Free markets and economies don't make poor children.  Parents do.<br>
<p>
If you'd like to educate the future parents in these economies so that<br>
they don't make even *more* poor children, you might consider<br>
designing some educational materials designed specifically for the<br>
villages you have in mind.<br>
<p>
Then, when Teledesic goes on line, set up a school in the third-world<br>
village of your choice.  Then, instead of experiencing all this<br>
frustration and heartache from afar, you'll be able to make a direct<br>
contribution.<br>
<p>
As you learn the language and lessons, keep an on-line journal on the<br>
web.  If you find your experience to be rewarding, perhaps your<br>
strategies can be replicated by others that have similar goals.<br>
<p>
Who knows, maybe all the armchair saviors will play the third-world<br>
like a video game, providing enlightenment and relief with all the<br>
pinpoint accuracy of smart bombs and cruise missiles.<br>
<p>
(You've probably already looked at it, but just in case, see <br>
www.teledesic.com - start planning and organizing now, and in 5 years<br>
perhaps you'll be ready launch your humanitarian campaign.  P.S., I<br>
too have been programmed with values that encourage pro-social<br>
efforts.  The Extropians simply insist that you not FINANCE these<br>
efforts by involuntary taxation.  Do what you need to do, just make<br>
sure you raise your money in a way that is entirely voluntary.)<br>
