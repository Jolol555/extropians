<i>&gt;  If you keep asking a sequence of "why" questions, before very many steps</i><br>
you <br>

<i>&gt;  produce  consciousness?". The only answer is that's just the way the</i><br>
Universe is.<br>
<p>
Because we exist in the universe we will never be able to completely<br>
understand it. However, in theory, using the resources of the universe we<br>
should be able to accelerate ourselves to a point where we can make an<br>
educated guess.  As for the question "Why is there something rather than<br>
nothing?" there isn't, what we percieve as something is nothing.  The<br>
question "Why does intelligence produce consciousness?" the dictionary<br>
defines consciousness as "aware, knowing" - The question answers itself.<br>
 There is always a lot of confusion about what consciousness is, this is<br>
because the word is used to discribe some sort of mythical magical thing,<br>
which can obviously not be explained for the same reason you can't explain<br>
why there are invisible pixies at the bottom of my garden.<br>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;No!  We have zombies today.  A color sensing computer can tell us</i><br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;what color something is far better than we can!  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I said INTELLIGENT zombies. I have to see an intelligent computer, color  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  sensing or not, when I do I will conclude it's conscious.</i><br>
<p>
We are conscious, we are aware, therefore we react.  You are not in control<br>
of it, the only way you could change what has happened and what is going to<br>
happen (the same thing) is to change the first glimmer of movement in the<br>
universe (obviously impossible because you are the result of that movement).<br>
 Everything ever since is a chain reaction, the only reason you're reading<br>
this is because you have no choice (you made a decision to read - but that<br>
decsion was not your own, it was based on the trillions of things that went<br>
before it).<br>

<i>&gt;  There is no point dancing around it, what we're talking about is the soul.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Information is as close as you can get to the traditional concept of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; soul and still remain within the scientific method.  Consider the</i><br>
similarities:<br>
<p>
I have no idea why you would consider the soul and consciousness as the same<br>
thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  1) The soul is non material and so is information.  </i><br>
<p>
Information is 'about' physical things.  It must be representing something<br>
physical and it must be represented by something physical.<br>
<p>
How are you defining the soul exactly ?  If the soul is like information,<br>
what is the information on ?<br>

<i>&gt;          &gt;just because abstract binary representations can represent color</i><br>
as <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;good as our sensations can doesn't mean they are the same</i><br>
        <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;fundamental representations.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Why not? In Science if two things react in exactly the same way then</i><br>
they're <br>
<i>&gt;  the same.</i><br>
<p>
An abstraction would only seem the same, on a physical level it would not be<br>
identical and nor would it react the same.  Science would not look at the<br>
software representing your brain on a computer, it would look at the physical<br>
reactions of the computer (at a level deeper than the fact it sounds the<br>
same).<br>
       <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;They are not consciously like each other though they can both</i><br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;simulate or represent each other in an abstract way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I strongly disagree. In daily life we use behavior to determine what other</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  people are thinking and are likely to do next, it seems to work pretty</i><br>
well. <br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  What evidence do you have that two entities can behave exactly the same</i><br>
way <br>
<i>&gt;  yet have different consciousness?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  It seems to me that the mind is what the brain does, if two brains are</i><br>
doing <br>
<i>&gt;  the same thing then there is only one mind.</i><br>
<p>
Only if they occupy the exact same space, otherwise they are seperate.  All<br>
of the differences between seperate objects are due to position and movement.<br>
