Indeed.  THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF SCIENCE FICTION  has been running sorrowful<br>
editorials and discussions about the `death of science fiction' - and this<br>
is a very insiderly source, run by cutting-edge editors.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, there are some wonderful books still appearing, in many<br>
ways deeper and richer and with far more literary density than has ever<br>
appeared in the genre (or adjacent to it) before.  I've just read, and<br>
strongly recommend, Richard Powers' 1995 novel GALATEA 2.2 [hope I'm not<br>
repeating myself here; with e-lists one tends to forget what one posted<br>
last week, or even last night].  It's a novel about a fucked-up and blocked<br>
writer (yawn) who returns home to Urbana-Champaign and visits the AI labs<br>
(where HAL was activated, you'll recall).  There he gets dragged into a bet<br>
between contending AI factions, and spends many months teaching a massive<br>
neural net, through various instantiations, to use English As She Is Spoke.<br>
 Does the machine come alive?  Is it a Stanislaw Lem-style Golem by the<br>
end, or Heinlein's Mike?   It's amazing stuff, beautifully written, and as<br>
far as I can see pretty well informed with up-to-date AI theory.<br>
