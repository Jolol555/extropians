I'm interested in human/machine interface technologies for the <br>
disabled.  One category of input devices is based on tracking eye <br>
movements (point of gaze).  This allows "people who cannot use their <br>
hands to "push buttons" with their eyes, like a visual mouse."<br>
<p>
See THE EYEGAZE SYSTEM at <a href="http://www.lctinc.com/doc/optic.htm">http://www.lctinc.com/doc/optic.htm</a>.<br>
<p>
This is an interesting product, but it's a few years old, and the <br>
system is pricey. <br>
<p>
With recent advances in computing power and the new all digital <br>
1394 (Firewire) interface, significant cost reductions could be <br>
achieved, resulting in a less expensive and more accurate system <br>
affordable enough for mainstream use.  <br>
<p>
It's interesting to me is that most of the design work has <br>
already been done.  Perhaps existing products could be licensed <br>
and adapted for OEM use?<br>
 <br>
See <a href="http://www.firewire.org/aboutta/products/sony.html">http://www.firewire.org/aboutta/products/sony.html</a>.<br>
<p>
It's interesting how many companies in the medical device industries <br>
a quite content selling their products at a very high price, since <br>
the insurance carriers pick up the bills.<br>
<p>
Consumer PC technologies are driven prices down, but many of these <br>
companies are reluctant to incorporate these less expensive <br>
technologies into their products because it would decrease their <br>
profits.<br>
<p>
One possible GENERAL strategy would be to examine the whole industry <br>
of medical electronics.  Then, instrument by instrument, create <br>
competing designs based on the latest microprocessors, PCs, &amp; DSPs.<br>
<p>
I imagine that many developing nations would appreciate having <br>
alternatives when shopping for the hardware for new hospitals.<br>
