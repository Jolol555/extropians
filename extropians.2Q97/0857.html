According to a news story in the April 25 Science [276:529-530] there is<br>
now some debate as to the source of the GRBs.  The initial analysis of the<br>
Hubble data 26 and 38 days after the burst confirmed the reported fading<br>
point source. However, Caraveo, et al of the IFC in Milan analyzed the<br>
data separately using what they claim to be "superior software" and<br>
concluded that the apparent source was moving across the sky.  Based on<br>
their analysis, the object may be only a few hundred lightyears away,<br>
closer than even the galactic source proponents had previously imagined.<br>
They could be seeing "anything from a transient cloud of gas associated<br>
with the burst to a background galaxy, aligned by chance with the<br>
pointlike object."  Astronomers hope to resolve this in a few months when<br>
the point source emerges from behind the glow of the sun - if it's still<br>
visible. <br>
<p>
In a related story, the recent claim of a cosmic axis by researchers at<br>
Rochester and Kansas has been met with considerable skepticism.  They<br>
supposedly used old data, ignoring 99% of recent radio galaxy observations<br>
and their conclusions are based on an outdated theory of radio wave<br>
polarization.  The two researchers are still confident that future<br>
studies will support their theory.<br>
