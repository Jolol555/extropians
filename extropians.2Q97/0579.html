&lt;Recently, last week suffered a heart attack, product of smoking two <br>
packs a day for forty years. Have survided both the attack and the <br>
medical system.  Would ask your help in where do I go from here, all <br>
suggestions and I mean all will be greatlyand humbly accepted.&gt;<br>
<p>
You haven't said whether you've quit smoking or not! For this post <br>
I'll assume that your heart problem is entirely due to smoking and not <br>
to other dietary, genetic or lifestyle factors...<br>
<p>
Until recently I smoked a pipe, inhaling massive doses of tar and <br>
nicotine. This had been a 30-year habit.<br>
<p>
I was able to easily quit by switching to Nicorette gum which is <br>
available without prescription.  I'm down to about four 2-mg pieces a <br>
day.<br>
<p>
In my opinion the gum is better than patches because you have to learn <br>
to control it and it provides relief for the oral-gratification <br>
cravings.<br>
<p>
I still don't like this oral-gratification habit but it's certainly <br>
better than polluting lungs and heart.<br>
