<p>
I completely agree with your first statement I quoted above. Part<br>
of the reason for my current enthusiasm about nanotech is its<br>
potential in creating new scientific instruments. So much of the<br>
nanotech horse-and-pony show ("popularization") focuses on benefits<br>
that ordinary consumers, voters, and taxpayers can understand that<br>
this is sometimes glossed over.<br>
<p>
What would be the best possible data-collection instruments for<br>
deciphering the mechanisms of gene expression and ontogenesis? What<br>
would be the best possible data-collection instruments for exploring<br>
the fine structure of (and the patterns of decay and degradation<br>
in) the brain? In either case, I think that if molecular nanotech<br>
is possible, then molecular nanotech will probably produce the most<br>
valuable scientific instruments for this research.<br>
<p>
So I'm not just looking for a technological quick-fix that will<br>
give us uploading and cheap transportation to LEO. I'm looking for<br>
a technological quick-fix that will give us vastly greater ability<br>
to explore and understand the functioning (and possible repair) of<br>
our own brains/bodies. ;)<br>
<p>
But you know, one of the nice things about a market economy is how<br>
it inoffensively promotes division of labor (well, inoffensively<br>
when it's working at its best, that is). If for some reason nanotech<br>
becomes a major fad (and that certainly hasn't happened yet), then<br>
perhaps I'll be satisfied that that ground is being well covered,<br>
and go back to trying to figure out how recursive/feedback<br>
unsupervised-learning neural net technology works.<br>
