<i>&gt; I propose an experiment with ourselves as the subjects:</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) We collectively choose a smart drug to try.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, that should be done by a trusted anonymous person<br>
as well, so that neither the experimenters nor the subjects<br>
have any expectation of what it's supposed to do.  The subjects<br>
should ideally be those with no previous experience.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 2) Someone slightly skeptical establishes a testing protocol.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       ( Lee, want to volunteer? )</i><br>
<p>
I don't qualify as only "slightly" skeptical, but I'll certainly<br>
lay out some rules.  RULE #1: anyone who regularly takes them<br>
now is out. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 3) Someone distributes a test ( could be a standard IQ test, or an </i><br>
<i>&gt;      attached program that will test hand-eye coordination, or</i><br>
<i>&gt;      whatever is appropriate to the drug of choice ) This establishes</i><br>
<i>&gt;      a baseline.</i><br>
<p>
A Java applet, of course.  It should have multiple tests, including<br>
linguistic ones, visual ones, etc., and the subjects should not know<br>
what they are expected to be good or bad at.  A web form can be used<br>
for reporting as well, but the test has to be an applet for timing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 4) Have a trusted person blindly distribute it and placebos by snail mail.</i><br>
<i>&gt;       ( Max, want to volunteer? )</i><br>
<p>
I'll kick in some bucks for postage; no need to burden ExI.<br>
