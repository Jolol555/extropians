On Sunday, April 13th, Jon Buratti, Douglas Houts, and I attended a <br>
seminar at the Life Extension Society in Rockville, MD.  The speaker was <br>
Tom Pafford, who hopes to release his new book, "The Super Young," this <br>
year.<br>
<p>
Tom describes himself as a layman who, after retiring several years ago, <br>
decided to try to find out why some people, like himself, seem to age <br>
less rapidly than their peers (and Tom does look good for someone in his <br>
early 50's).  After 4 years of research, and collaboration with Dr. <br>
Walter Smith (who I believe is a member of the American Academy of <br>
Anti-Aging Medicine), he has concluded that aging can be postponed and <br>
lifespan extended by reducing the rate of cell turnover (i.e. the rate at <br>
which cells die and are replaced), and that free radicals, telomere <br>
shortening, and blood glycolization may all shorten lifespan.  My <br>
impression is that his book and program don't really break any new <br>
ground, but instead represent more of a comprehensive snapshot of the <br>
current thinking in life extension.<br>
<p>
Of perhaps greater interest to those of us in the DC area is his plan to <br>
open a clinic in Northern Virginia which will feature a program of <br>
hormone replacement therapy, as well as lifestyle, exercise, and diet <br>
recommendations.  Tom estimates that he will need approximately $350,000 <br>
to $500,000 to open the clinic.  To that end he is currently focusing on <br>
securing a loan from the Small Business Administration, but depending on <br>
how things go with the SBA he may turn to individual investors.  Those <br>
interested in becoming investors, or in getting additional information on <br>
the book or clinic, are invited to contact Tom at paffor9@idt.net.<br>
<p>
Below is some additional information on the LES from their web page <br>
(<a href="http://www.clark.net/pub/kfl/les/">http://www.clark.net/pub/kfl/les/</a>).  DC-area Extropians may definitely <br>
want to consider membership.<br>
<p>
"The mission of the Life Extension Society (LES) is to support research <br>
and public<br>
education in human life extension. LES published the Life Extension <br>
Society News<br>
and sponsors speakers and seminars on life extension topics such as <br>
nutrition and<br>
nutritional supplementation, anti-aging medicine, cryobiology, and<br>
nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
LES is a membership organization, with most members being from the <br>
mid-Atlantic<br>
region. LES membership dues currently are $20.00 per calendar year. New <br>
members<br>
are always welcome...<br>
<p>
The first two phases of cryogenic preservation occur at the site of a <br>
donor's<br>
deanimation and together are called cryonic stabilization. LES is <br>
acquiring<br>
cryonic stabilization equipment and supplies and providing them to <br>
cryonics<br>
organizations for stabilizations in the mid-Atlantic region."<br>
