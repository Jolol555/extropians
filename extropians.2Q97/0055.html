03/28/97. Ch.6 of Robert Rosen's _Life Itself_ discusses 'Analytic and<br>
Synthetic Models': "Modeling ... is the art of bringing entailment<br>
structures into congruence.... the essence of art is that, at root, it<br>
rests on the unentailed, on the intuitive leap. I have stressed<br>
repeatedly that the encodings and decodings on which modeling relations<br>
depend are themselves unentailed. Thus, theoretical scientists must be<br>
more artists than craftsmen; Natural Law assures them only that their<br>
art is not in vain, but it in itself provides not the slightest clue =<br>
how<br>
to go about it".<br>
<p>
6A. 'Modeling Relations': "An examination of modeling within =<br>
mathematics<br>
reveals two quite different approaches to modeling. One of them, which =<br>
I<br>
shall call /analytic/, is intimately tied to the idea of direct<br>
(Cartesian) product ... the notion of efficient cause. The other, which<br>
I shall call /synthetic/, is tied rather to the idea of /direct sum/ =<br>
and<br>
to the notion of material cause.... Only in very special situations do<br>
they happen to be equivalent in any sense, and these special situations<br>
all inherently involve some kind of linearity.... In fact, the<br>
difference between direct sum and direct product, between synthetic and<br>
analytic models, is also closely allied to the difference between<br>
/syntactic/ and /semantic/.... from this viewpoint, Godel's<br>
Incompleteness Theorem is an assertion that direct product [does not<br>
equal] direct sum (more specifically, direct product is 'bigger' ... we<br>
shall see further that an assumption of coincidence between analysis =<br>
and<br>
synthesis leads directly to the concept of /mechanism/ ... In a sense,<br>
it is the thrust of this entire work that this hypothesis of analysis =<br>
=3D<br>
synthesis must be dropped.... By dropping it, we enter a new realm of<br>
system, which I call /complex/ ... The distinction between relational<br>
and Newtonian models of natural systems will become crucial here,<br>
because as we shall see, the former extend to the realm of complex<br>
systems, while the latter cannot."<br>
<p>
6B. 'Some Preliminaries: Equivalence Relations': "At one level,<br>
equivalence relations can be looked upon as a vehicle for constructing<br>
new sets (quotient sets) from given ones.... the relation R ... allows<br>
us to ... first, find in S/R the equivalence class to which s belongs,<br>
and then, locate s within this class. A property of s that depends only<br>
on its class ... will be called a /general property/ of s, relative to<br>
R. On the other hand, a property of s that depends on where it is =<br>
within<br>
its class ... will be called a special property.... We can think of the<br>
set S/R of equivalence classes as a /base space/. Over each point in<br>
this space, there is an equivalence class, the /fiber/ consisting of =<br>
all<br>
elements of S that project onto this point.... the base space here is<br>
the habitat of the general properties under R; the fibers embody the<br>
special properties.... I will henceforth call the mapping f: S -&gt; X an<br>
/observable/ of S; the totality of values f(S) of f will be called its<br>
/spectrum/.... When we write the expression 'f(s)', we get the<br>
impression that f, the mapping, is fixed, and s, its argument, is<br>
variable in S. But the role of argument and mapping are formally<br>
interchangeable.... given S, the set R(S) of all equivalence relations<br>
on S is determined. It is in fact a certain set of subsets of 2^SxS. =<br>
The<br>
usual operations of union, intersection, and complementation are<br>
available in R(S) ... R(S) has an enormous amount of internal =<br>
structure;<br>
it is a /lattice/.... The symbol R here ... is in fact an example of a<br>
functor, which at this level operates, not on individual systems, but =<br>
on<br>
whole collections (categories) of them... we know that there is a close<br>
relation between H(S,*R*), the set of all observables, and R(S), the =<br>
set<br>
of all equivalence relations on S. In fact, if f is any observable, we<br>
know we can associate with it a definite equivalence relation Rf in =<br>
R(S)<br>
... if one observable f tells us something about the elements of S, =<br>
then<br>
two observables (f,g) should tell us more.... two elements s, s' are<br>
equivalent under Rfg if neither f nor g can tell them apart. The<br>
equivalence classes of Rfg are thus the intersections of all the<br>
equivalence classes of Rf with all the equivalence classes of Rg. In<br>
other words, Rfg has /more classes/ than either Rf or Rg alone.... In<br>
formal terms, it is said that Rfg is a /refinement/ of Rf and of Rg."<br>
<p>
In case, like me, that wasn't all immediately intuitive to you, you can<br>
take it as providing a mathematical argument for the notion that 'the<br>
whole is greater than the sum of its parts'. Or, if that phrase seems<br>
simplistic or bothers you, that different functions can be observed =<br>
from<br>
different 'angles' or levels of the same physical system.<br>
<p>
03/28/97. (The next few chapters of _Life Itself_ describe simulation,<br>
mechanisms (Turing machines) and a relational theory of machines,<br>
rounding out Rosen's mathematical case for a ontological distinction<br>
between mechanisms and organisms. 03/28/97.)<br>
<p>
03/30/97. 6C &amp; D discuss the set-theoretic details of analytic vs<br>
synthetic models: "The whole purpose of [synthetic] direct sums is<br>
precisely to create a situation in which encoding is itself =<br>
entailed....<br>
For in this situation, and in it alone, we may replace art by craft."<br>
These models are equipped with a natural order, but it is one which the<br>
model builder provides through his own indexing.<br>
<p>
The remainder of ch.6 is very mathematical but basically claims that:<br>
"synthetic models are an embodiment of pure syntactics, whereas =<br>
analytic<br>
models are inherently semantic." Rosen concludes: "Every synthetic =<br>
model<br>
is an analytic model ... but, there generally exist analytic models =<br>
that<br>
are not synthetic models." The reductionist approach, says Rosen,<br>
mandates that analytic and synthetic models coincide; but, he claims,<br>
this situation is limited only to mechanisms and is totally inadequate<br>
for the explanation of organisms.<br>
