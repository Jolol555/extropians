First you teach them how to think like a transhumanist.  Discussion of more<br>
radical ideas should be just that, discussion of ideas.  Don't say "this is<br>
how it's going to be" but "it's going to be how you want it to be", then put<br>
them all in a discussion forum and let them decide how they want it to be.<br>

When I read Engines of Creation the first time the thing that had the<br>
greatest effect on me was not the possibilities of nano-technology, but how<br>
it is already used within us.  Making people take a look around them to see<br>
how amazing the world is already will often soften the blow of radical<br>
concepts.<br>
