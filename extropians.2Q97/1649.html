	I had heard of an attempt to domesticate a certain type of fox (silver?)<br>
because its fur was so highly prized.  The process used was to breed the<br>
animals that tolerated the shortest distance between them and a human being<br>
before running.  They were domesticated, in that they were friendly to<br>
people.  The problem is domesticity and coat color were linked so the<br>
project turned out a useless result.  I would guess that this is a result<br>
of keeping the fox in a semi-juvenile stage.  The same was done in the<br>
domestication of wolves.<br>

<i>&gt; modern farms has improved greatly over older intuitive breeding.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; it stands to reason that great further improvements will be possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; when we can cheaply read out the entire genome of each individual in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; breeding program, match them with detailed behavioral data, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; even splice together desired trial genomes.</i><br>
