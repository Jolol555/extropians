What did you think I was saying? <br>
<p>
I feel that you have entirely missed my point. Any law/statute -- no<br>
matter how it was achieved -- is not a law unless it is enforced. You<br>
need not be in law school to know that law enforcement is by definition<br>
coercion. Or more simply, "Follow this rule or else!"<br>

Dear Hagbard and other fellow Extropians,
<p>
Unfortunately, voluntary compliance to most ethical and moral principals is
noted
primarily by its breach.
<p>
Can anyone provide me with a viable social alternative to "coercion"???
