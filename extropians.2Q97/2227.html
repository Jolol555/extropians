        I'm much the same way.  I've been a latent extropian for all of my<br>
rational life...before I had ever discovered the definition.  After my<br>
encounters with objectivism a few years back (which, I must add, totally<br>
changed my life's focus etc.) my mind was broadened.  When I heard the<br>
philosophy of extropy, it was sort of a dream come true: a group of people<br>
who desire future progress --technologically, politically and ethically--<br>
and effectively kineticize their potentials.  I'm sure that there are<br>
thousands of others who agree with the fundamentals of extropy but just<br>
haven't been introduced to the philosophy in the right way.  The "right<br>
way" to convey extropian ideals is probably the biggest obstacle standing<br>
in the way of our progress.  As it is now, extropy is quite small --albeit<br>
in a nice way--  and fairly unknown to the world...hence we get littered<br>
with the quick-to-judge tag of "cult" from time to time.  When we find a<br>
way to conquer those quick-to-judge taggers, then we'll be able to<br>
demonstrate our credibility; as always, getting there is the hard part.<br>
