The DEAD MEDIA Project:  A Modest Proposal and a Public Appeal<br>
<p>
by Bruce Sterling<br>
<p>
	Ever notice how many books there are about the Internet these days?  <br>
About 13,493 so far, right?  And how about "multimedia?"  There are <br>
8,784 books on this topic,  even though no one has ever successfully <br>
defined the term.  CD-ROM -- is there a single marketable topic left that <br>
hasn't been shovelwared into the vast digital mire that is CD-ROM?  And <br>
how about the "Information Superhighway" and "Virtual Reality"?  Every <br>
magazine on the planet has done awestruck vaporware cover stories on <br>
these two consensus-hallucinations.  <br>
<p>
	Our culture is experiencing a profound radiation of new species of <br>
media.  The centralized, dinosaurian one-to-many media that roared and <br>
trampled through the 20th century are poorly adapted to the postmodern <br>
technological environment.  The new media environment is aswarm with <br>
lumbering toothy digital mammals.  It's all lynxes here, and gophers there, <br>
plus big fat venomous webcrawlers, appearing in Pleistocene profusion.  <br>
<p>
	This is all well and good, and it's lovely that so many people are <br>
paying attention to this.  Nothing gives me greater pleasure as a <br>
professional garage futurist than to ponder some weird new mutant <br>
medium and wonder how this squawking little monster is going to wriggle <br>
its way into the interstices between human beings.  Still, there's a <br>
difference between this pleasurable contemplation of the technological <br>
sublime and an actual coherent understanding of the life and death of <br>
media.   We have no idea in hell what we are doing to ourselves with these <br>
new media technologies, and no consistent way even to discuss the <br>
subject.   Something constructive ought to be done about this situation. <br>
<p>
	I can't do much about it,  personally, because I'm booked up to the <br>
eyeballs until the end of the millennium.  So is my good friend Richard <br>
Kadrey, author of the COVERT CULTURE SOURCEBOOK.  Both Kadrey and <br>
myself, however, recently came to a joint understanding that what we'd <br>
really like to see at this cultural conjunction is an entirely new kind of <br>
book on media.  A media book of the dead.   <br>
<p>
	Plenty of wild wired promises are already being made for all the <br>
infant media.  What we need is a somber, thoughtful, thorough, hype-free, <br>
even lugubrious book that honors the dead and resuscitates the spiritual <br>
ancestors of today's mediated frenzy.  A book to give its readership a <br>
deeper, paleontological perspective right in the dizzy midst of the digital <br>
revolution.  We need a book about the failures of media, the collapses of <br>
media, the supercessions of media, the strangulations of media, a book <br>
detailing all the freakish and hideous media mistakes that we should know <br>
enough now not to repeat, a book about media that have died on the barbed <br>
wire of technological advance, media that didn't make it, martyred media, <br>
dead media.  THE HANDBOOK OF DEAD MEDIA.  A naturalist's field guide for <br>
the communications paleontologist.<br>
<p>
	Neither Richard Kadrey nor myself are currently in any position to <br>
write this proposed handbook.  However, we both feel that our culture <br>
truly requires this book:   this rich, witty, insightful, profusely <br>
illustrated, perfectbound, acid-free-paper coffee-table book, which is to <br>
be brought out, theoretically, eventually, by some really with-it, cutting-<br>
edge early-21st century publisher.  The kind of book that will appear in <br>
seventeen different sections of your local chainstore:  Political Affairs, <br>
Postmodern Theory, Computer Science, Popular Mechanics, Design Studies, <br>
the coffeetable artbook section, the remainder table -- you know, <br>
whatever.   <br>
<p>
	It's a rather rare phenomenon for an established medium to die.  If <br>
media make it past their Golden Vaporware stage, they usually expand <br>
wildly in their early days and then shrink back to some protective niche as <br>
they are challenged by later and more highly evolved competitors.  Radio <br>
didn't kill newspapers, TV didn't kill radio or movies, video and cable <br>
didn't kill broadcast network TV; they just all jostled around seeking a <br>
more perfect app.  <br>
<p>
	But some media do, in fact, perish.  Such as:  the phenakistoscope.  <br>
The teleharmonium.  The Edison wax cylinder.  The stereopticon.  The <br>
Panorama.  Early 20th century electric searchlight spectacles.  Morton <br>
Heilig's early virtual reality.  Telefon Hirmondo.  The various species of  <br>
magic lantern.   The pneumatic transfer tubes that once riddled the <br>
underground of Chicago.  Was the Antikythera Device a medium?  How <br>
about the Big Character Poster Democracy Wall in Peking in the early 80s?  <br>
<p>
	Never heard of any of these?  Well, that's the problem.   Both Kadrey <br>
and I happen to be vague aficionados of this field of study, and yet we both <br>
suspect that there must be hundreds of dead media, known to few if any.  <br>
It would take the combined and formidable scholarly talents of, say, <br>
Carolyn "When Old Technologies Were New" Marvin and Ricky "Learned Pigs <br>
and Fireproof Women" Jay to do this ambitious project genuine justice.  <br>
Though we haven't asked, we kinda suspect that these two distinguished <br>
scholars are even busier than me and Kadrey, who, after all, are just <br>
science fiction writers who spend most of our time watching Chinese <br>
videos, reading fanzines and making up weird crap.<br>
<p>
	However.  We do have one, possibly crucial, advantage.  We have <br>
Internet access.  If we can somehow convince the current digital media <br>
community-at-large that DEAD MEDIA is a worthwhile project, we believe <br>
that we may be able to compile a useful public-access net archive on this <br>
subject.  We plan to begin with the DEAD MEDIA World Wide Web Page, on a <br>
site to-be-announced.  Move on, perhaps, to alt.dead.media.  Compile the <br>
Dead Media FAQ.  We hope to exploit the considerable strengths of today's <br>
cutting-edge media to create a general public-domain homage to the media <br>
pioneers of the past.<br>
<p>
	Here's the deal.  Kadrey and I are going to start pooling our notes.  <br>
We're gonna make those notes freely available to anybody on the Net.  If <br>
we can get enough net.parties to express interest and pitch in reports,  <br>
stories, and documentation about dead media, we're willing to take on the <br>
hideous burdens of editing and system administration -- no small deal <br>
when it comes to this supposedly "free" information.   <br>
<p>
	We both know that authors are supposed to jealously guard really <br>
swell ideas like this, but we strongly feel that that just ain't the way to <br>
do a project of this sort.  A project of this sort is a spiritual quest and<br>
an <br>
act in the general community interest.  Our net heritage belongs to all <br>
netkind.  If you yourself want to exploit these notes to write the DEAD <br>
MEDIA HANDBOOK -- sure, it's our "idea," our "intellectual property," but <br>
hey, we're cyberpunks, we write for magazines like BOING BOING, we can't <br>
be bothered with that crap in this situation.  Write the book.  Use our <br>
notes and everybody's else's.  We won't sue you, we promise.  Do it.  Knock <br>
yourself out.   <br>
<p>
	I'll go farther, ladies and gentlemen.  To prove the profound <br>
commercial potential of this tilt at the windmill, I'll personally offer a <br>
CRISP FIFTY-DOLLAR BILL for the first guy, gal, or combination thereof to <br>
write and publish THE DEAD MEDIA HANDBOOK.  You can even have the title <br>
if you want it.  Just keep in mind that me and Kadrey (or any combination <br>
thereof) reserve the right to do a book of our own on the same topic if you <br>
fail to sufficiently scratch our itch.   The prospect of "competition" <br>
frightens us not at all.  It never has, frankly.  If there's room for 19,785  <br>
"Guide to the Internet" books, there has got to be room for a few useful <br>
tomes on dead media.<br>
<p>
	Think of it this way.  How long will it be before the much-touted <br>
World Wide Web interface is itself a dead medium?  And what will become <br>
of all those billions of thoughts, words, images and expressions poured <br>
onto the Internet?  Won't they vanish just like the vile lacquered smoke <br>
from a burning pile of junked Victrolas?  As a net.person, doesn't this <br>
stark realization fill you with a certain deep misgiving, a peculiarly <br>
postmodern remorse, an almost Heian Japanese sense of the pathos of lost <br>
things?   If it doesn't, why doesn't it?  It ought to. <br>
<p>
	Speaking of dead media and mono no aware  -- what about those <br>
little poems that Lady Murasaki used to write and stick inside cleft <br>
sticks?  To be carried by foot-messager to the bamboo-shrouded estate of <br>
some lucky admirer after a night's erotic tryst?  That was a medium.  That <br>
medium was very alive once, a mainstay of one of the most artistically <br>
advanced cultures on earth.  And isn't it dead?   What are we doing today <br>
that is the functional equivalent of the cleft sticks of Murasaki Shikibu, <br>
the world's first novelist?  If we ignore her historical experience, how <br>
will we learn from our own?<br>
<p>
	Listen to the following, all you digital hipsters.  This is Jaqueline <br>
Goddard speaking in January 1995.  Jacqueline was born in 1911, and she <br>
was one of the 20th century's great icons of bohemian femininity.  Man Ray <br>
photographed her in Paris in 1930, and if we can manage it without being <br>
sued by the Juliet Man Ray Trust, we're gonna put brother Man Ray's knock-<br>
you-down-and-stomp-you-gorgeous image of Jacqueline up on our <br>
vaporware Website someday.    She may be the patron saint of this effort. <br>
<p>
	Jacqueline testifies:  "After a day of work, the artists wanted to get <br>
away from their studios, and get away from what they were creating.  <br>
They all met in the cafes to argue about this and that, to discuss their <br>
work, politics and philosophy....  We went to the bar of La Coupole.  Bob, <br>
the barman, was a terrible nice chap...  As there was no telephone in those <br>
days everybody used him to leave messages.  At the Dome we also had a <br>
little place behind the door for messages.  The telephone was the death of <br>
Montparnasse."<br>
<p>
	"*The telephone was the death of Montparnasse.*"  Mull that <br>
Surrealist testimony over a little while, all you cafe-society modemites.  <br>
Jacqueline may not grok TCP/IP, but she has been there and done that.   I <br>
haven't stopped thinking about that remark since I first read it.   For whom <br>
does the telephone bell toll?  It tolls for me and thee -- sooner or later.  <br>
<p>
	Can you help us?  We wish you would, and think you ought to.<br>
