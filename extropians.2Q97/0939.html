<i>        &gt;originally at 45 degrees, it will always be blocked by the second         </i><br>

        <br>
<p>
You are 100% correct.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What actually happens is that each filter takes out 50% of the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;incident photons, and the second filter therefore passes 25% of        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the photons, the third passes 12.5%, etc. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Teue, but it's not relevant, at least not very relevant, if you're talking <br>
about an individual proton. The concept of probability starts to get <br>
fuzzy and not very rigorous when you  talk about individual one of a kind <br>
events. If I say there is only a 25% chance that it will rain tomorrow and it <br>
turns out to be a rainy day, was I wrong? If it doesn't rain was I right?  <br>
If that was the only information you had and I never made another prediction <br>
it would be difficult to form a conclusion about my competence as a weather <br>
forecaster. <br>
<p>
I'm sure I'll hear from the Bayesian people about that remark.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The point is that quantum values are indeterminate, which means not         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;fixed until measured!</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Maybe, but the Copenhagen interpretation is not the only one consistent with <br>
the facts.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me: </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Some atoms produce 2 photons of the same polarization but traveling         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;in opposite directions, so if you measure the polarization of one         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;you know the polarization of the other.</i><br>
          <br>
<i>        &gt;Sure, if the other photon hasn't interacted with something, which         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;you can't know faster than light speed.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
As I said, even if you instantly change something on the other side of the  <br>
universe you can not use this effect to exchange energy or information, <br>
the effect is real however, as can be seen in Quantum Cryptography. You can <br>
also make a destructive measurement on one photon and learn something about <br>
the other without harming it.<br>
