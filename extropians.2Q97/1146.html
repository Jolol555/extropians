A while back in our cloning discussions, I think that I read some <br>
excellent statements on the extropian viewpoint regarding this new <br>
technology.<br>
<p>
I'd like to get a few statements from those who were involved in the <br>
discussion for the purpose of writing a short article for a political <br>
web magazine that has asked me to represent the futurist viewpoints on <br>
various topics.  Very nice of them to do so, as they could have <br>
restricted their scope to the usual range of <br>
progressive-to-conservative.  Good chance to spread a few memes!<br>
<p>
Feel free to email off list.<br>
<p>
Thx,<br>
<p>
