I don't believe in jail or execution. Why? Because I don't believe in<br>
the notion of State enforced criminal law -- being an anarchist who<br>
doesn't believe in the benefits of the State, this should be an<br>
obvious stance.<br>
<p>
What *do* I believe in? Torts. I don't see why there should be any<br>
real distinction between what happens if you break a contract, break<br>
a piece of my personal property, or break my leg -- I should sue you<br>
for damages, and get restitution. This is essentially a return to the<br>
early legal systems much of Europe had, before kings discovered that<br>
declaring certain offenses to be violations of the *KING'S* peace and<br>
not torts was a way to earn a buck by collecting the fines for the<br>
crown instead of for the victim.<br>
<p>
In the context of a tort based legal system, "jail" and "execution"<br>
become meaningless concepts. The issue is restitution, pure and<br>
simple.  This might, of course, effectively result in most murderers<br>
being effectively enslaved for decades or even their entire lives<br>
making restitution to their victims, but I see nothing inherently<br>
wrong with that. If you cause damage, you have an obligation to make<br>
good on it. Damage is a matter between victim and tort feasor.<br>
<p>
For others who influenced my viewpoint, see Friedman's "The Machinery<br>
of Freedom" and Benson's "The Enterprise of Law".<br>
