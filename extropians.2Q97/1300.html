<i>&gt;     Thanks Natasha for your comment about Michael Ventura.  I've never met </i><br>
<i>&gt;     the man.  Do you know what he meant about "the belly of the beast"?  </i><br>
<p>
The phrase refers to his interest in digging deep into dark issues and<br>
residing there while observing that society.  He has a keen insight into<br>
life from this angle, as if he were, possibiliy, a cinematographer<br>
documenting life from the "inside" of Hades.  Not all his writing is dark,<br>
however.  I have enjoyed his pieces, from many perspectives.  As he enjoyes<br>
quality jazz, humor, and the lifestyle of West Hollywood; it permeates his<br>
writing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Does the quote I mentioned seem to connect to the person you met or is </i><br>
<i>&gt;     there incongruity there.  I'm very big on a person being the truth </i><br>
<i>&gt;     s/he speaks.  Not always easy in error-prone humanity.  But my motto </i><br>
<i>&gt;     is when you screw up, you atone and realign yourself to your creed.</i><br>
<p>
I suppose he, like most people, has contraditions in his makeup.  And, a<br>
nebulous nature is his an aspect of his style.<br>
