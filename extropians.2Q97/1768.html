That's not what I'm saying at all.  Their are many species in which females<br>
remain fertile until they die except when their lives are extended in a<br>
laboratory setting.  Human females in primitive societies regularly live to<br>
the age of menopause which is an event specified by the genes, not a<br>
product of cellular decay.<br>
<p>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Fertility is already in decline by that period (probably due</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to other agents already discussed) so being able to give birth would</i><br>
not<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; result in a great success for the genes. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That seems like another circular argument. If the genes weren't reducing</i><br>
<i>&gt; fertility then they'd have a greater chance of success. </i><br>
<p>
That's where those other factors come in.  Things like cellular decay and<br>
tissue breakdown might not be programmed into genes.  They could be the<br>
result of the high cost of maintaining an individual.  If it takes more<br>
energy to keep an individual alive than it takes to ensure gene survival<br>
through other methods the individual will be allowed to die.  In the case<br>
of human females it would take more energy than is justified by gene<br>
welfare to keep them fertile.  It takes very little energy to make sure<br>
that she does not give birth when the chances of the child and her<br>
surviving the event are much lower than usual.  Therefore, in the years she<br>
has left before the effects that helped in youth but will hurt in old age<br>
result in death the most useful function she can do from a gene's point of<br>
view is help her genes survive in other relatives through either assisting<br>
in gathering or giving knowledge to the tribe.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is a fallacy to think that genes don't "care" about a person after they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have reproduced.  Genes care about a person as long as the existence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that person is a benefit to the genes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course it's some kind of compromise between all these factors. </i><br>
<p>
Which is why calling the above argument circular is uncalled for.  Genes<br>
cannot be considered one group.  Some genes helped in youth and cause (or<br>
allow to occur) a decline in fertility in old age.  A gene coding for<br>
menopause came along and it was very successful in promoting its survival<br>
in other carriers.  It's just taking advantage of a pre-existing situation.<br>
 The "menopause gene" does not cause the decline in fertility.  It simply<br>
turns the decline towards its best advantage.<br>
