Didn't say what I meant to: that as far as *analyzing* evolution of facts<br>
and values, you'll be lead into finding that the value (in hypothesized<br>
beings) that is identical to what you (the analyzer) call success, will<br>
be the one with the most stability, and everything else might as well be<br>
coded (in your analysis) as ideas of how to achieve it.  The flexibility in<br>
your (the analyzer's) "stance" (as Dennett calls it) sort of leaves you<br>
holding the ball.<br>
<p>
I like your division into small and large spaces better, but I think small<br>
spaces only look that way *after* evolution has tromped all over large<br>
areas and found good spots with boundaries.  In more stable areas I<br>
guess the advantages of sex just take longer to show up.  Btw, there's<br>
also the choice (now) of being sometimes-asexual, sometimes-sexual, so<br>
you can mix the advantages of stability and new ideas.<br>
<p>
But to combine asex in one area with sex in others, don't you need a<br>
*main* parent?  Hmm, like the evo of ribosomes (inhereted from mother)<br>
vs. nuclei (mixed)...<br>
