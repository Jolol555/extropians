<i>&gt;Yes, it is suspicious, but I there is a lot of taboo around the idea of</i><br>

<i>&gt;Most companies are very comfortable with the idea of producing drugs for</i><br>

<i>&gt;look at the original research articles, which shouldn't be too diffcult.</i><br>

I think you're onto something here Tony, it's the same with everything<br>
Extropian, everything to do with consciously improving oneself: it sends<br>
shivers down peoples' spines, it is 'taboo'.  What a sick society! (I<br>
exaggerate of course, and the bottle is, on the whole, half full.)<br>
<p>
That's why the full might of the scientific community hasn't been<br>
focussed on 'smart drugs', or even the 'placebo' effect, come to think<br>
of it (e.g. how could we learn to control these obvious psychosomatic<br>
powers better?)<br>
