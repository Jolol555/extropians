Sorry I can't be of more help, I don't have the book any more - although<br>
I had been thinking recently of trying the diet again, and these posts<br>
have reminded me of that, so I might get one of his books again.  He's<br>
written two or three, mostly the same info with variations and different<br>
recipes and updated versions. One is called "Eat Yourself Slim", as I<br>
recall.  I'll try and look it up, if you like.<br>
