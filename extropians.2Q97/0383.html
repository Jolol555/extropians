I was thinking along the same lines recently when in my religion (morality,<br>
Christian justice, brainwashing, time to practice riding on the edge of<br>
acceptable behavior so the teacher does not notice but the students do,<br>
etc...) class we discussed the spiral of violence.  <br>
<p>
Basically, it starts with basic injustice, then violent reaction occurs to<br>
the injustice, then there is increased repression that leads to more<br>
violence etc.  We were suppossed to think of ways to break the spiral.  To<br>
do that one first has to identify the basic injustice.  I concluded that<br>
this is a very subjective thing.  As long as the majority has the ability<br>
to impose its wishes on the minority there will be injustice.  Eventually<br>
the majority gets smaller and smaller as more people feel they are the<br>
victims of injustice.  Massive spending ensues in the form of revolution or<br>
getting votes.  Until that point is reached, people feel powerless and feel<br>
the use of semi-random violence is nescesary.<br>
<p>
Of course, this allows a relatively simple solution.  Destroy the power of<br>
the majority to impose their will on the minority by destroying government.<br>
 Unfortunately, that will not happen until some libertarians, hopefully of<br>
the anarcho-capatalist breed, gain control of the schools through massive<br>
amounts of money.  I suspect that, given that society continues on its<br>
present course this could take quite a long time (my children would be<br>
dead).<br>

<i>&gt; Government has many parallels.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Break away from the existing power with fewer laws and more freedom.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Everyone has a voice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Powerstruggle ensues.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Vote for an accepted 'believer' who will then 'have your voice'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can't do THAT and be a good citizen!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Persecution of those who speak out against the state.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Appealing to emotion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ad infinitum.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "A rose by any name would smell as sweet."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Religion is the opiate of the masses."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "When the state does something 'for your own good', be frightened."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My questions are:  Will we ever be rid of 'religion'?  Should even try?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is the cycle unbreakable?</i><br>
