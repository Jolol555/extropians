E-prime generally helps with clarity and honesty.  It bars passive voice<br>
(mistakes were made) and unsubstantiated generalizations (people are dumb).<br>
 You can certainly get around these obstacles, but at least e-prime makes you<br>
think about actors, assertors, and evidence.  When I write in e-prime, I tend<br>
to have to mention actors, assertors and evidence, and that makes my writing<br>
easier to understand and harder to misunderstand.<br>
<p>
If you *want* to hide the actors, assertors, or evidence, you certainly can.<br>
 You often have to use expressions even harder to understand than the passive<br>
voice you avoided in the first place.  Still, using e-prime encourages zip<br>
and clarity.<br>
