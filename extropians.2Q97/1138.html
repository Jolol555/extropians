A computer has beat the best human at Chess.  Once again we have<br>
passed another long-forseen milestone toward AI.  And again it was<br>
accomplished by a relatively focused and non-general system, and by<br>
more standard software engineering (rather than some "AI"ish approach<br>
intended to implement more general agents).<br>
<p>
Now clearly it will one day be possible to create software whose<br>
reasoning abilities and breadth of skills are as broad and general as<br>
humans, if not more general.  But I'm wondering: how long this day be<br>
put off by tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of generality?<br>
<p>
On the benefit side: we already have humans who can't use much of<br>
their generality.  People can learn to do a remarkably wide variety of<br>
things.  But a standard lament is of people who must spend all day<br>
doing some narrow task, but long to express all the other sides of<br>
themselves.  People like me leave promising careers in one field<br>
because we're bored and want to do something new for a while.  People<br>
fight to move up heirarchies where they can take a broader view.<br>
<p>
On the cost side: It can be very expensive to make software able to do<br>
a wide variety of different tasks.  It costs in speed of execution,<br>
and in time to write, test, and maintain the code.  People have a huge<br>
"common sense" knowledge base to draw on, and writing it all down for<br>
computers is a daunting task.<br>
<p>
If the most general reasoning in combined human-computer systems<br>
continues to be done by people, and computers take the more routine<br>
specific tasks, then the generality boundary between computer and<br>
human reasoning may move slowly.  Yes computers get faster, but people<br>
also learn more about how to do general tasks well, including how to<br>
program and use computers.  Eventually we will learn how to speed up<br>
and further modify human brains, and if this day comes soon enough,<br>
computer AI may never displace humans at the general tasks.<br>

P.S. I seem to recall a "lightfoot" panel in UK that came to a similar<br>
conclusion about AI research on the early 70s.  Any sources on this?<br>
