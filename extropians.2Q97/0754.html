<i>&gt; From: MikeRose &lt;mich_ros@alcor.concordia.ca&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not the National Inquirer, it is the Extropy List, but there does</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to be an inquistion by some self-dubbed high priests of</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge/reality.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (reminds me of Robert Anton Wilson's 'New Inquisition'. W. Reich</i><br>
<i>&gt; would have been given hell by some of you guys, keep up the good work</i><br>
<i>&gt; people like him shouldn't be given a voice!!!!!)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Keep the thumbscrews on the truth</i><br>
<p>
I'm prepared to be wrong. I've been wrong many times in the past and<br>
expect to be wrong many times in the future.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, one has to maintain a certain minimum standard of<br>
mental hygene in order to get through your average day. If you don't<br>
maintain a firm and critical understanding of the likely effect of<br>
walking in front of a bus, or handing over your money to a con man,<br>
you won't get very far.<br>
<p>
Given this, a balance has to be struck between spending one's days<br>
assessing every claim one hears with full attention, and ignoring all<br>
claims.<br>
<p>
The way most of us have done this is to assess the strength of given<br>
laws of science we've learned over the years, especially based on how<br>
often and how well they have been demonstrated, and to give less<br>
credence to unusual claims that violate strongly demonstrated laws,<br>
and more credence to those that do not violate any laws or only<br>
violate those that have "problems" with them anyway. The more<br>
extraordinary the claim, the better the evidence had better be.<br>
<p>
Thus, I'm not going to waste much time on people claiming that they've<br>
built a "water powered car" that works by perpetual motion<br>
mechanisms. Why? Because it violates too many strongly held laws. I'm<br>
happy to believe in it if someone will drive it up to me and let me<br>
take some time actually examining it and I find it works, or if<br>
someone who I strongly trust has done so. Otherwise, I've got too many<br>
things to do in my day, and too many idiots come up with this sort of<br>
extraordinary claim too often without any evidence backing them at<br>
all.<br>
<p>
The probability of it being real is microscopic, especially if its<br>
"easy" to build, so the likely benefit to me of believing in its<br>
reality if its real (measured in dollars) times the probability of of<br>
it being real is a tiny fraction of the money I've already lost<br>
thinking about it. Even spending the time I've spent thinking about<br>
this silly water powered car has likely been far too much thus far, on<br>
a cost/benefit analysis.<br>
<p>
