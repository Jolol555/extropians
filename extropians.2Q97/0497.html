Whenever I work at an event, I produce a piece of artwork to reflect <br>
upon its significance, such as a tape or a photo montage.  This time it <br>
takes the form of an online vigniette.  Feel free to forward it to <br>
anyone--enjoy!<br>
<p>
*********************************************************************<br>
<p>
I have taken a brief trip into the future and been given the <br>
opportunity to see how beautiful it will be.  I have returned with a <br>
renewed sense of hope and optimism for the path that can be taken by <br>
humanity in its evolution.<br>
<p>
My journey began this morning as I dressed for my expedition, pulling <br>
on a pair of jeans and selecting an appropriate t-shirt ('If Gays and <br>
Lesbians are given civil rights, everyone will want them').  Digging <br>
through the pile of shoes in my closet, I found my combat boots, the pair <br>
which survived hundred of hours of marching, chanting, patrolling, <br>
holding the line.  Those were more confrontational days, and at times I <br>
had felt as battered as the worn leather that for nine years had pounded <br>
asphalt, concrete, mud.  As I bent to lace the eyelets, I smiled to <br>
think that at the decrepit age of 32 I was coming out of retirement again <br>
to lend experience to the kids, the youth, the ones who come after to <br>
claim their own piece of respect.  They weren't going to let me <br>
enjoy that rocking chair just yet.<br>
<p>
Despite the sunshine, an icy wind tore through my clothing as I <br>
walked down to Dupont Circle.  Would people show?  But they were <br>
already there, milling in anticipation, setting up booths, readying <br>
the stage.  No counterprotesters in sight.  The police were relaxed <br>
and chatty as I reviewed the day's schedule.  Youth Pride was going to <br>
happen.  As the sun continued to warm, men and women of all ages <br>
filtered into the circle.  Some brought their dogs.  Some dressed <br>
in rainbow colors or printed t-shirts.  Some wore vinyl with metallic <br>
lipstick.  The drag performers splashed vividly in hues of bright green <br>
and purple, vamping and flirting their way through the crowd.  <br>
<p>
The hours blended into a series of sensual impressions.  Jessica Xavier, <br>
transgender activist extraordinaire, doing hotlicks on the electric <br>
guitar.  Two girls kissing for a photographer.  A mod guy from the <br>
Polyester Liberation Organization adjusting his tie.  Sista Face <br>
braving the chill in an evening gown to give it up to the crowd.  A <br>
nervous girl about to give her first speakout.  Friends huddled <br>
together on the grass.  A dog wearing a backstage pass on his collar.<br>
<p>
These were youth that had experienced taunts from schoolmates, physical <br>
assaults, parental betrayal, drug addictions, the worst of treatment <br>
from everyone, and they were not here to shake their fist.  My <br>
generation had pounded on the door until it opened a crack, now was <br>
the time to offer a hand through it.  Today was for saying to the world:  <br>
here I am, I exist, I love, I hope, I dream, I struggle.  They had <br>
created within this circle of grass a new world, one in which everyone <br>
could express their individual beauty without restraint.  It would only <br>
last five hours, but each of them would carry the strength of this <br>
experience, the knowledge that it could be done, into the larger world.  <br>
In the words of my friend Shelly, spoken by her lover Heidi:<br>
<p>
	There is no box that can hold me.  There is no<br>
	category that defines me.  I live outside the<br>
	oppressive binary society.  I live in the margins <br>
	of the marginalized, because that is where I find<br>
	reality.  That is where I find 3-dimensional thinking<br>
	that comprehends more than just X and Y.  That is <br>
	where I find room enough to breathe.<br>
<p>
