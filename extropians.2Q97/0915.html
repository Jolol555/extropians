<i>&gt;     I know many of you may say that it is a trivial matter, but I think it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;deeper than that.  It's about freedom.  Please respond with comments,</i><br>
<i>&gt;whatever your opinons are.  Thanks.       Shawn Johnson</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it's deep.  Yes, it's about freedom.  But so are lots of things.<br>
I have chosen to leave that particular battle unfought for the nonce.<br>
It's a special case, and I prefer to work on the general principles<br>
of tolerance, rationality, nonaggression, and do on.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the song "Live and Let Live", by Leslie Fish:</i><br>
<p>
Whatever you may choose to wear is no concern to me.<br>
Wear nothing, or gorilla suits, or gowns made in Paree.<br>
Just don't sit naked on my chairs, it's sure to leave a splotch,<br>
And don't complain to me if you get sunburn in your crotch.<br>
<p>
Live and let live is the only thing to do.<br>
The causes we can fight for don't need adding to.<br>
Freedom and survival are cause enough to hit,<br>
So stick to what's worth fighting for -- forget the diddly shit.<br>
