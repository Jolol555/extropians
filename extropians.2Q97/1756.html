Apart from the fact that I'd love to see a _natural_ computer simulation: <br>
please observe that the infrastructure supporting you is still located in<br>
the real, physical world. An efficient spatially distributed system will<br>
still let implementation-layer relativistic constraints shine through<br>
(while reading teledesic <a href="http://www.teledesic.com">http://www.teledesic.com</a> info , I was thrilled<br>
that GEO latency considerations rule out req/ack comm loop of most<br>
protocol, while LEO gives fibrelike latency).  (&lt;bluesky&gt;Intrinsic<br>
nonlocality of most QM theories &amp; similiar constraints for the hypothetic<br>
simulated universe assuming, this would indicate that the machine running<br>
us exists in a pretty high-dimensional space&lt;/bluesky&gt;).  Anyway, most<br>
people criticizing uploader wannabes as world-weary aesthete solipsists<br>
bark up an entirely wrong tree, when talking about pulling the plug. If<br>
anything, we are going to shut them down, not vice versa. Unless<br>
transcension is a really real possibility, atoms for circuitry are a<br>
scarce resource. Somebody might come and want both the ground your tread<br>
on, and your body for reaction mass and circuitry. Better be careful.<br>
Things as smart and fast... you won't even knew what had hit you. <br>

P.S. It seems the "bulk of terrestrial water being of extraterrestrial<br>
origin/Earth barraged by ice fragments" hypothesis is not quite as firmly<br>
established as I'd liked it to see (free water in space! Let's pack up<br>
things and move.). Similiar things apply to maximicroturbines. So I guess<br>
things from Back to the Future * are not quite around the corner. Btw, had<br>
a long walk around Munich today, tried to view large civilization<br>
artefacts, and particulary, their installation rate from a neolithicum<br>
denizen point of view. Came back home pretty impressed, as things seem to<br>
have started moving visibly, and ours is not a particularly exciting patch<br>
of the world. While not a matter of decades, the Spike imminent appears to<br>
be a very real possibility. <br>
