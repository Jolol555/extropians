<i>&gt; Do you consider yourself an expert on investing?</i><br>
<p>
 No, but I don't consider myself a fool either.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Have you thought about which investment strategies might make good sense </i><br>
<i>&gt;given the technological changes we expect to see over the coming decades? </i><br>
<p>
 Yes, day trading (nano-second trading?) is interesting to me.<br>
I suggest using the fastest computer with the fastest connection <br>
to be able to react to the market before anyone else.<br>
Tech can make this kind of investing into a race.<br>
This process can be fully, hands off, computerized; <br>
the idea already begins to bore me.<br>
<p>
 Knowing what will happen before it happens is also nice.<br>
The futures exchange can make you millions quick <br>
if you have global weather forcasts for the past 200 years on record.<br>
Many seasonal predictions can be made with 90% accuracy.<br>
Those odds are alot better than blackjack!<br>
<p>
 I say futures is the way to go.<br>
Learn the future and make money too.<br>
I think learning what the future holds is fun.<br>
It gives me time to prepare for what will soon be in the present;<br>
I can put my self in a position of control and wait for the earnings to<br>
pour in, <br>
instead of mearly reacting to what the present shoves in my face.<br>
Having been a boy scout, I love to prepare, <br>
sometimes more than doing what I prepare for.<br>
<p>
 One investment idea I was toying with <br>
was considering plate tectonics' effect on real estate.<br>
If you invest in the long term, don't invest in India.<br>
That is, of course, unless you want your property subducting under the<br>
Asian plate <br>
and pushing up the Himalayas.<br>
<p>
 I wanted to build a cryo-tomb <br>
at the site that would remain on the surface of the Earth the longest.<br>
What is a better place for a monument to immortality?<br>
I haven't yet figured out where that would be though.<br>
A good map is hard to find.<br>
I tried looking for someone at NASA that could help me,<br>
but they have so much cool stuff I got distracted and forgot about it.<br>
Hopefully I won't be on this planet much longer<br>
and there won't be a need for a cryo-tomb anyway.<br>
<p>
 Can anybody point me towards Alpha Centauri?<br>
