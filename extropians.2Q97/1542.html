Work will eventually be a thing of the past. <br>
<p>
Look around, people are too preoccupied with work and too little<br>
occupied with play. We are slaves to the dollar, indeed "death by the<br>
dollar" is more likely than not in this world. More people are killed<br>
every year on their way to work, or at work, or due to work-related<br>
infirmities than from anything else. Why is workaholism a virtue? Truly,<br>
it is a disease. It leaves impressionable children at day-care, husbands<br>
in front of the TV, and young wives dreaming of the spin-cycle. Some of<br>
the greatest minds in the world have been duped into thinking that the<br>
final expression of their success is the thickness of their billfold.<br>
When I hear someone say that their work is interfering with their<br>
imagination, I have to ask, "What were you thinking about before you<br>
were told to go out and earn a living?" <br>
<p>
Why not put everyone out of work? If labor unions would quit their<br>
quibbling over the use of robotics to replace humans, people might<br>
actually enjoy their lives. Why when you are young do you have to work<br>
your ass off to save up enough money to be happy when you're old? Do not<br>
the young have as much a right as anyone to enjoy the world? I am alive<br>
right now. So are you. This means that we are not dormant, not waiting<br>
to spring from a chrysalis at some indeterminate point in the future.<br>
Every moment of our lives is the payoff, not an investment. Be<br>
profoundly aware of what you are doing at all times. Eat well, exercise,<br>
drink heartily, study what interests you, enjoy your body, mind and<br>
soul. Ponder your existence and always seek self-improvement, but not by<br>
someone else’s standards, only by your own. <br>
<p>
Vitality is profoundly attractive. You are alive. Act like it.  <br>
<p>
That's all.<br>
<p>
