     It occurred to me the other day that object-oriented (4GL) programming <br>
     is following in the same path as carbon-based life's primordial <br>
     evolution (on Earth anyway).  Metaphorically, if amino acid chains are <br>
     like 3GL procedural programming, then our first OO programming would <br>
     be the first "life forms" or objects for independent processing and <br>
     interaction.  <br>
     <br>
     Extending that metaphor, it could be observed that we are in the <br>
     processing of creating life using our silicon-based technology that <br>
     mirrors (intentionally?) our own ancient beginnings.  I'd like to hear <br>
     from any mondo-advanced programmers about what the next step (or <br>
     several next steps) beyond distributed objects or other <br>
     post-Client/Server technology is on the horizon in our technological <br>
     evolution.<br>
     <br>
