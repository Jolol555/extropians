<i>&gt; "The eradication of poverty must be at the centre</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our development efforts into the 21st century.</i><br>
<i>&gt; For as long as poverty is allowed to grow</i><br>
<i>&gt; unchecked, child malnutrition, preventable disease</i><br>
<i>&gt; and widespread illiteracy will continue to</i><br>
<i>&gt; thrive," said Ms. Bellamy.</i><br>
<p>
It is of course a nice sentiment if it is voluntary.<br>
It is important to note that while there is certainly a lot that additional<br>
money can do for these people, welfare cannot completely eliminate poverty.<br>
 In the Newsweek of May 5 there is an article titled "The Culture of<br>
Poverty."  It reviews a study called "What Money Can't Buy" by economist<br>
Susan Mayer of the University of Chicago.  It says that the poor (this is<br>
the US we are talking about, not places with real poverty) are different<br>
from the not poor in ways other than money.  Specifically, diligence,<br>
honesty, good health, and reliability are the key factors.  A child must be<br>
raised with parents that instill these values for them to have a good<br>
chance in life.  Sending welfare checks will not help assure that these<br>
values are taught.  I am not suggesting some plan of government<br>
intervention to correct this problem.  I am just saying that poverty cannot<br>
be eradicated with the economy like it is.  We will have to get to the<br>
point where everyone is so rich, that those who lack the valuble values<br>
mentioned above can live well through charitable organizations.  That is,<br>
supplying someone with constant nutritious food, medical care, and housing<br>
is as cheap as giving them some change is today (raise this figure if your<br>
a little more generous or willing to pay a little more to get them off the<br>
streets and into their clean, well lit lower class housing).<br>
