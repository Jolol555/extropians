     I've always thought a pretty good test of intelligence was to ask <br>
     someone what they would do with $X, and keeping increasing the value of <br>
     X until they can't think of anything else to do with it, except buy 50 <br>
     Rolls Royce's (as a certain guru did not long ago). I suspect most <br>
     people on this list wouldn't have any trouble finding sensible ways to <br>
     spend their first trillion dollars.<br>
     <br>
     My addition/clarification to that:<br>
     <br>
     First off, thanks Max for instilling a measure of vision and nobility <br>
     into a topic and about which I started getting my ire up.<br>
     <br>
     I would like to add that although the notion of "plenty" may be a <br>
     non-issue for some extropians, it is not necessarily a measure of a <br>
     person's worthiness or intellect that s/he settles for substantially <br>
     less.  Rather, it is a limitation of his/her imagination and to that <br>
     extent, those with loftier aspirations should graciously allow them to <br>
     be or inspire them further.<br>
     <br>
     Although I don't scrutinously follow Bill Gates' entrepreneurial or <br>
     philanthropic efforts, it is hard not to regard him ultimately as <br>
     short-sighted and somewhat facist, given the incredibly and <br>
     precedent-setting resources he has amassed.  <br>
     <br>
     I think the mental exercise of what to do with a trillion dollars <br>
     could ultimately end up chasing its own tail in the paradigm that some <br>
     of us (including me) imagine, where humans are not auto-driven by <br>
     greed and acquisition but by vision and a sense of connectivity and <br>
     purpose.  Motivation by acquisition seems primitive by comparison, <br>
     rather like giving the dolphin a fish or the chimp a banana if it does <br>
     a learned task.  Sure it's where we come from, evolutionarily <br>
     speaking, but where are we headed and how quickly?  Pretty quickly <br>
     considering the global neural network expansion and explosion of <br>
     technological innovation.<br>
     <br>
     And where are we headed?<br>
     <br>
     In Star Trek: First Contact, Picard and the 21st century character, <br>
     Lily have a discussion about the enormous cost of titanium to build a <br>
     ship the size of the Enterprise.  It was so encouraging to hear Picard <br>
     speak of a world to come that was not motivated by acquisition and <br>
     self-centered pursuit, as if Gene Rodenberry (whom I regard as a late <br>
     20th century H.G. Wells) continued to promote his philosophy beyond <br>
     the grave.  Is it naive and altruistic to envision and work toward a <br>
     world where many extropian notions of success are rendered moot?  And <br>
     granted, we have to work within the given paradigm but any <br>
     motivational speaker will tell you to start living the way you <br>
     imagine, the way you desire.  (And that doesn't mean doing irrational <br>
     things like buying a Rolls while you are on the welfare "rolls".)<br>
     <br>
     If the definition of extropian includes continually pushing the limits <br>
     of what it is to be human, where would considerations such as this <br>
     factor in?<br>
     <br>
     I wonder if it would take a trillion dollars to make the Enterprise?<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
