Subject: anti-spam?<br>
Date: Tuesday, June 24, 1997 10:59 PM<br>
<p>
I just received another spam - the guys are suggesting me to<br>
send bulk email to 80,000 people for $50.  Spam to distribute spams.<br>
They give their snail-mail address and a reply form that I should<br>
send in with a check.  This is a frequently used technique that<br>
allows spammers to avoid receiving e-mail bombs and to be able<br>
to easily sort the replies.<br>
<p>
Now, what if I go for it, and send out a message suggesting people<br>
next time they get a spam with a snail-mail, to mail envelopes to the<br>
spammer's address, containing hate notes, pieces of all kinds of dirty,<br>
smelly, poisonous, explosive, and illegal substances, and everything<br>
else distracting, dangerous, and unpleasant that people can think of?<br>
<p>
Could such an "anti-spam spam" help generate enough "negative feedback"<br>
for the spammers to stop asking for snail-mail replies?  That may make<br>
things much more difficult for them.<br>
<p>
This suggestion doesn't require adoption of any general standards or laws.<br>

Dear Alexander and other fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
The offer you received appears at first instance to be a violation of<br>
several existing laws.<br>
<p>
The Attorneys General of the various states, the FTC, the SEC, the Postal<br>
Inspector and various other agencies have a task force in place to handle<br>
such "spam" using both criminal and civil statutes.<br>
<p>
You may wish to print out the offer and send a copy to the Attorney<br>
General in your state.<br>
<p>
In most states "spam" complaints are being handled by the consumer frauds<br>
bureau or unit in the AG's office.<br>
<p>
If you are aware of the point of origin of the spam send it to the state<br>
where it is originating in.<br>
<p>
For further information contact me.<br>
<p>
Best wishes,<br>
<p>
A.M. Genen<br>
<p>
