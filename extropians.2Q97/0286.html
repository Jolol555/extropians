<i>&gt; Oops! sorry to give you the wrong impression.The exact opposite of what I</i><br>
<i>&gt; meant, mysticism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was talking about a form of thinking that explans "spiritualism" in</i><br>
human's<br>
<i>&gt; mind. A sustained low focus type, often mistaken for mysticism, exploited</i><br>
by<br>
<i>&gt; religions of the world, but nothing mysterious, just under-researched. </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suggested it was a part of our natural cognitive state.</i><br>
<p>
	Since most religions are founded on the teachings of mystics, the<br>
"exploitation" is understandable, especially when the original teacher<br>
moves on and the control-oriented people take over.<br>
	If the mystical experience is "part of our natural cognitive state", then<br>
it would serve us to explore the experience more fully, would it not;<br>
especially considering the obvious "reprogramming" that seems to occur with<br>
most of those who report having the experience, including NDE?<br>
<p>
Believe me, there is *nothing* like that experience; even<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  psychedelics give merely a weedy little echo of the 'cosmicness' of</i><br>
it.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  And I think that sentient beings who *lived* from that perspective</i><br>
could<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  be immensely powerful and joyful creatures.  Easily able to re-program</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  themselves, to morph, etc. - in fact, Transhuman!)</i><br>
<p>
	"Believe me, there is nothing like that experience;..."  ...Of course; but<br>
that can be said of many expeiences, can it not?<br>
	"...immensely powerful..."...When the need for power disappears, then all<br>
power is realized, right?   Isn't the striving for power an indication of<br>
fear and the need to control?<br>
 <br>
<p>
 but your so called 'mystics' have found meditation does it also. Also<br>
exercise seems to help and mindless simple things like shaving...<br>
driving....<br>
This process helps with creativity also. <br>
<p>
	It appears that creativity can be accessed when one gets out of the<br>
critical, judgemental state of mind.  This is referred to as "being in the<br>
space".  This can be accomplished by remaining focused on "the point of<br>
concentration".  The mindless activities, you mention, are ways of dropping<br>
the critical, judgemental state of mind.and leaving oneself open to the<br>
creative process.<br>
