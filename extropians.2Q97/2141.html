<i>&gt; While I see that it is anarchic, in some sense, to have all people</i><br>

<i>&gt; person you come into contact with.</i><br>
<p>
If it's impossible, then the market will find a way to simplify matters. <br>
Most likely many organisations will agree to common standards just as they<br>
do on the Net, because it simplifies arrangements for all of them. <br>
However, unlike current monopoly law anyone who values their freedom over<br>
corporate convenience will be able to choose an alternate legal system<br>
which doesn't use those standards. They will just have to pay more and<br>
accept the inconvenience. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; IMO, this is ridiculous. The only real option is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; contract among groups of people. So we're back again to a government.</i><br>
<p>
No. See above; the IETF is not a government, since anyone can choose to<br>
run their own network protocol rather that TCP/IP. Their only "punishment"<br>
is that they will be unable to communicate with anyone who does follow the<br>
standard. The Internet is a good example of an anarchy, with each ISP<br>
having its own 'private legal system' (i.e. usage policy) and 'private<br>
protection agency' (e.g. blocking known spamming sites to protect the<br>
users from unwanted junk-mail). Most of its deficiencies are the result of<br>
government coercion (e.g. cryptography patents and export laws preventing<br>
widespread use of cryptographic privacy and authentication). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Contracts is a sticky business. Without an established law of contracts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; this idea won't even work.</i><br>
<p>
Then all you need do is agree to use the current contract law. If monopoly<br>
government is as good as you imagine, then people will freely choose it<br>
over private alternatives. Of course, people could break that initial<br>
agreement to abide by that law, but then no-one will ever make another<br>
contract with them and they'll be an outlaw. Not a good idea. <br>
<p>
Another possibility is to use escrow agents to hold a fine which will be <br>
paid in the event that one party breaks the contract. Then neither side <br>
has an incentive to do so.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; measure one's profit in? Not dollars or francs or rubles, because a</i><br>
<i>&gt; currency would require a large group contract which would "govern" its</i><br>
<i>&gt; value.</i><br>
<p>
I seem to have missed the contract which governs the current value of<br>
currencies. Personally I thought it was simply the current price on<br>
the exchange markets. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What happens when a party declares his rubles to be worth more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the contract stipulates?</i><br>
<p>
No-one will buy them from him. This is the way currency markets work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So then a weapons race among PPA's? Small tactical nukes built from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anarchist's Cookbook?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, why should only big governments have nukes? I'd certainly want to<br>
sign up with a nuclear-armed protection agency if I had the choice; I<br>
don't see that they could protect against any remaining governments<br>
otherwise. Of course I'd like to have my own nuke too, but I very much<br>
doubt I could afford one.<br>
<p>
Perhaps you should also read 'Basement Nukes' (Erwin Strauss, Loompanics<br>
Unlimited). There are some technical inaccuracies in the bomb designs but<br>
I found the basic political ideas very interesting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But in the U.S. republic, there's nothing one idiot can do in four years</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the next idiot can't undo in four years.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately in real life the next idiot normally makes it worse, and<br>
with a government there's no way I can stop them. If an idiot takes over<br>
my PPL I simply choose another and they go bust.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; So eventually the 49%</i><br>
<i>&gt; become 51% and kill the other 49%.</i><br>
<p>
Uh, no... the 49% become 40%, then 4%, then 0.004% as the 51% kill them<br>
off. The 51% have the US armed forces to back them, and the 49% will have<br>
a hard time defeating them. And in a democracy the more that die the less<br>
chance they have of changing things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We don't really get anywhere, but we</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure as hell bounce back and forth like mad. I like this system because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it keeps the idiots occupied, leaving us free to go about our business</i><br>
<i>&gt; of ascension.</i><br>
<p>
Shame about all the people who get screwed over in the meantime, while<br>
the government maintains your convenient lifestyle.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; So I should spend everything I have to avoid being killed? How is this</i><br>
<i>&gt; better than a 100% income tax?</i><br>
<p>
Because the government will take a 100% income tax and then kill you<br>
anyway. Of course buying a gun costs much less than 100% of your<br>
income, and few people will try to kill you if you have any reasonable<br>
chance of killing them in the process. A larger group can buy a few<br>
nukes; do you think the Nazis would have tried to kill the Jews if they<br>
were nuclear-armed? Hmm, now there's an idea for an SF story...<br>
