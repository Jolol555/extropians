I asked a galfriend who's forever finishing off a PhD in history (and whose<br>
father is a notable Australian historian, so she's drenched in the subject<br>
matter), and to my surprise her response was this, confirming Robin's<br>
declaration:<br>
<p>
`I for my part have never heard of cliometrics and know of no cliometrician<br>
anywhere. Statisitics in history was kind of trendy in the late 70s when<br>
the 'new social history' was in vogue. This involved looking at birth, deaths<br>
and marriage certificates, tax records and any obscure reference to ordinary<br>
Jo and Jill Blows that were in existence and flogging them for all they<br>
were worth to find any interesting historical social trends which might<br>
tell us something about the 'ordinary' people as opposed to kings and<br>
emperors.<br>
As all that could be found was often just vital statistics these became the<br>
centre and focus of historical studies and used as the basis for all sorts<br>
of imaginative speculation. That is the last time I remember stats being<br>
used to any significant degree by historians<br>
<p>
`I have certainly never read or seen anything with even the most passing stats<br>
in historical works recently. Although my thesis contains a few which<br>
might make it even more untrendy.' <br>
