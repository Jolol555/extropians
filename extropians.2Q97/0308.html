Dear all,<br>
<p>
A year or so ago, I maintained "A Fringe-Watchers Guide to High<br>
Weirdness," a web site that was an annotated encyclopedia of links to<br>
"fringe" sites and information. Categories included aliens, hidden<br>
history, giant conspiracies, unorthodox science, contactees, and so on.<br>
The site was immensely popular and generated a great deal of positive<br>
attention. <br>
<p>
Then the server it was maintained on went away and the site disappeared.<br>
Until now. <br>
<p>
At the urging of emailers and other interested bystanders, I have<br>
uploaded the site at a new home:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.sff.net/people/MBourne/Weirdness.htp">http://www.sff.net/people/MBourne/Weirdness.htp</a><br>
<p>
I will be working on it in the coming weeks, and at this time I can't<br>
guarantee which of the hundreds of links are still active. But I will<br>
edit as I go along and add new sites to replace those that have gone<br>
away.<br>
<p>
I'm open-minded about these topics, yet I know the site won't be for<br>
everyone (a sense of humor is encouraged). Feel free to drop in and<br>
browse. Keep checking back as the site develops and grows. It's meant to<br>
be enjoyed.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
Mark<br>
