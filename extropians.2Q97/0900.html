Me, a faithful lunatic, has always been mesmerized by the<br>
Moon as the major future space industry location. However,<br>
near-Earth asteroids might prove to be much more<br>
interesting first target for prospection and mining.<br>
<p>
The major minus of the Moon is the distance, its location<br>
at the bottom of a (shallow, though) gravity well, and<br>
kinetical unaccesibility of certain resources due to<br>
differentiation in the course of ur-material accretion.<br>
Vastly simplified, this means dense minerals accumulating<br>
at the core (which is pretty inaccessible due to pressure,<br>
and uncomfortably hot in the bargain), light in the outer<br>
shell, and generic depletion of light elements, which<br>
have escaped into space, being literally baked out<br>
(especially true for our beloved, forever smallpox-marked<br>
Mona).<br>
<p>
Ceres, the first planetoid, was discovered in 1801 in Palermo<br>
(by one Piazzi). We now know more than 2 k objects in orbits<br>
between Mars and Jupiter. More than 30 objects have orbits<br>
with the perihelion within Mars orbit. About 20 objects<br>
have their perihelions within the Earth orbit, this are<br>
the Apollo asteroids. Asteroids are commonly classified<br>
in Hirayama families by their orbit data; about 40 such<br>
families are known. Additionally, there are the Trojans,<br>
which move in 60 deg distance onto Jupiter orbit, as seen<br>
from the Sun (as predicted by Lagrange).<br>
<p>
These are but the largest primeval debris pieces, smaller ones<br>
being inaccessible to astronomic observations. The smaller the<br>
body, the larger the probability of a close encounter. For mining,<br>
planetoids of few 10-100 m size are more than sufficient. Few<br>
g/cm^3 density assuming, that's a lot of material outside the<br>
Earth gravity well.<br>
<p>
For prospection, appropriate targets must first be found. As now<br>
widespread Peltier-cooled CCDs and "lightweight giant" amateur<br>
telescopy has now reached very respectable dimensions, many<br>
asteroids are discovered by hobbyists (notice NEAP's $500<br>
bribe). Furthermore, recently emerged awareness for rare, but<br>
desastrous hits by relatively small (few km) asteroids, might<br>
soon grant us a new watchful chain of eyes.<br>
<p>
Once discovered, not much information can be futhur gained<br>
by remote sensing. Sure, we can measure the albedo (and<br>
its fluctuations, which give us the rotation frequency,<br>
and lots of information about geometry and surface<br>
reflectance distribution), maybe utilize the Hubble, or<br>
radar, but still, investigation by a probe will still be<br>
mandatory. The intercepting probe must first match its<br>
speed, then go into orbit (inasmuch a few 100 m body might<br>
be said to have enough mass for a measureable orbit, whereas<br>
the larger asteroids escape velocity cannot even be reached<br>
by vigorous jumping) . The volume can be very precisely<br>
measured by evaluation of a surface snapshot sequence,<br>
while in orbit. Average density is available from orbit<br>
data (we sure know the mass of the probe).<br>
<p>
There are three types of chondrites known: carbonaceous<br>
chondrites (further subdivided in types I, II, III), plain<br>
chondrites, and enstatite chondrites.<br>

(all in all, a darn funny, nay _unearly_ composition, no?<br>
 I already see a number of geologists developing a funny<br>
 stare, and a number of saliva stains upon their ties).<br>
<p>
Heliothermics with flimsy (few um Al foil on a hyperbolic<br>
truss mirror) may easily reach about 6 kK in space, albeit<br>
requiring tracking, especially for rotating bodies (negation<br>
of rotation is mandatory (orelse where to with all the pesky<br>
oxygen?) on the middle run).<br>
<p>
Electrolysing (PV electricity) a molten silicate poodle,<br>
whether with metal or carbon (pyrographite from carbonaceous<br>
chondrite) will result in silicon/metal/silicate multiphase<br>
alloy, oxygen/carbon dioxide irreversibly escaping into space.<br>
Electrolysed water may yield hydrogen for reduction, metal<br>
and molten silicate glass material for truss rods construction<br>
(imagine neoariadne agents, deftly spinning glass fibre in<br>
space). Sputtered aluminum and iron are great material for<br>
mirrors, ebeam cannons are useful for deploying these.<br>
Inductive metallurgy is easy to do, under microgravitation<br>
conditions, and lots of hard vacuum.<br>
<p>
Producing semiconductor-grade silicon will be sure a chore<br>
under this circumstances. Sad thing beam writers bein a<br>
natural for space semiconductor production.<br>
<p>
As usual, I now have run out of steam at the most interesting<br>
spot. Sorry. 'gene <br>
