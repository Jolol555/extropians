I haven't read _State of the Art_ yet, but Banks has talked about this<br>
somewhat elsewhere.  About how Contact's secular missionary work, it's<br>
"good works", provides the justfication for the Culture's easy<br>
existence.  Some people may feel this way; I think many would find<br>
purpose on their own.  If it's really a problem, cultural or even<br>
genetic evolution will happen: those who find reasons to live will live.<br>
<p>
Digression:<br>
There's a cliche that if we make contact with an advanced civilization<br>
our research will drop, because "everything's been done, why bother?"  I<br>
find little support for this in general.  In real life many aborigines<br>
have adapted well to Wester culture, I hear.  I don't know how well<br>
their culture survives, but the people adapt and go on.  In SF... Julian<br>
May had the most likely scenario, I think, where in a generation or two<br>
humans have learned Galactic physics and are holding their own.  Brin<br>
has some die-off of research, but not completely, and there he has the<br>
justification that not only has it all been done, but so much has been<br>
done that even the Galactics don't know what's there.  Clarke had<br>
die-off in Childhood's End, but the Overlords refused to tell us<br>
anything.<br>
<p>
End digression; the Culture, I think, has the single best reason<br>
anywhere for the humans to give up research: the Minds.  Even if you<br>
learn what's happened up till now, theù can vastly outthink you.<br>
<p>
Except that they run out of physics to do, and biology and history allow<br>
contributions by humans.  Small ones, but useful ones.  Mathematics<br>
would be the area where nothing ever slows the Minds down, and humans<br>
have no advantage.  Oddly enough, in _Excession_ we learn that esoteric<br>
mathematics is the grand addiction of the Minds.<br>
<p>
But in an earlier book, there was a human mathematician anyway.  People<br>
do things.<br>

 <br>
Flow?  People have talked about it here.<br>

} At any rate, I stand by saying that the Culture, while a possible peak<br>
} in cultural design space, isn't a peak we could get to by a socialist<br>
} (planned/skyhooks) path, but only by a capitalist (Darwinian/cranes)<br>
<p>
One point I forgot last time: the Culture isn't a monolithic socialism.<br>
It's an anarchy of socialisms: each ship or habitat is socialistic (or<br>
dictatorial) but relations between them is anarchic.  He argues that<br>
this is inherent to the nature of the medium.  It's hard to levy<br>
property taxes on property which can run away, and conversely the amount<br>
of uncontrollable interactions on a ship (breathing) may screw over a<br>
local market mechanism.  Okay, his anticapitalism is stronger than that,<br>
but he himself recognizes that the Culture may not be creatable by its<br>
own lifestyle; he worries more about a need for agression to evolve<br>
intelligence and technology.<br>
<p>
But hey, we aren't living the way we once did either.  The key is<br>
whether a society is sustainable.  I don't like May's Milieu because it<br>
seems too pacifistic to survive against more "primitive" societies<br>
without locking them up.  But the Culture is wealthy enough to do what<br>
it wants and healthy enough to _want_ to research and explore and<br>
computer model generations of warship-designs without the competition of<br>
survival pressure.  "People hate to feel useless."  And there's probably<br>
status to be gained.  "I found a trillion year old star!"  "I proved the<br>
433rd _Serious Callers Only_ Conjecture!"  And whatever Banks thinks, I<br>
doubt that some monetary mechanism to determine who gets the steaks or<br>
the shrimp will damage his Utopia.<br>
<p>
If we were to seriously consider the economics of such an advanced<br>
society (it's a game, Perry) I'd worry more about allocation of raw<br>
resources and control of spreading.<br>
