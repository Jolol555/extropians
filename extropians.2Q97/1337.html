Attached you'll find two funny pieces I though you might all enjoy. THe<br>
first is a satire on phony virus warnings, and the second is a<br>
libertarian parable about Noah if he had to build his Ark today.<br>

Subject: FREE Money Virus<br>
<p>
There is a computer virus that is being sent across the Internet. <br>
If you receive an e-mail message with the subject line "Free Money,"<br>
DO NOT read the message. DELETE it immediately, UNPLUG your computer, <br>
then BURN IT to ASHES in a government-approved toxic waste disposal <br>
INCINERATOR.<br>
<p>
Once a computer is infected, it will be TOO LATE. Your computer will <br>
begin to emit a vile ODOR. Then it will secrete a foul, milky DISCHARGE. <br>
Verily, it shall SCREECH with the tortured, monitor-shattering<br>
SCREAM of 1,000 hell-scorched souls, drawing unwanted attention to <br>
your cubicle from co-workers and supervisors alike. After violently <br>
ripping itself from the wall, your computer will punch through <br>
your office window as it STREAKS into the night, HOWLING like a <br>
BANSHEE. Once free, it will spend the rest of its days SODOMIZING <br>
household PETS and MOCKING the POPE.<br>
<p>
Some filthy, disgusting miscreant... some no-good, low-down, good-for- <br>
nothing DIRTY SNAKE, in twisted pursuit of his own sadistic dreams, <br>
is sending this virus across the Net via an e-mail entitled "Free <br>
Money." What is so terrifying about this virus is that you do not <br>
even to have to open the e-mail for it to activate. In fact, you do <br>
not even need to RECEIVE the e-mail. You do not even need to OWN a <br>
COMPUTER. "Free Money" can infect even minor HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES.<br>
<p>
How it does this with straight ASCII code is, frankly, a matter of <br>
some debate... but BELIEVE YOU US, if this weren't a SERIOUS <br>
situation, we wouldn't be discussing it in ALL CAPS.<br>
<p>
So for the LOVE OF GOD, forward this e-mail to all those you claim <br>
to care about, all those you purport to love. Don't do it later! <br>
Do it NOW! Now! Now! NOW! NOW! NOW!<br>
<p>

NOAH AND THE GOVERNMENT.<br>
<p>
And the Lord spoke to Noah and said:  "In six months I'm going to make it<br>
rain until the whole earth is covered with water and all the evil people<br>
are<br>
destroyed.  But I want to save a few good people, and two of every kind of<br>
living thing on the planet.  I am ordering you to build Me an Ark."<br>
 <br>
And in a flash of lightning he delivered the specifications for an Ark.<br>
"OK,"<br>
said Noah, trembling in fear and fumbling with the blueprints.<br>
 <br>
"Six months, and it starts to rain," thundered the Lord.  "You'd better<br>
have<br>
my Ark completed, or learn how to swim for a very long time."<br>
 <br>
And six months passed.  The skies began to cloud up and rain began to fall.<br>
 <br>
The Lord saw that Noah was sitting in his front yard, weeping.  And there<br>
was<br>
no Ark.  "Noah," shouted the Lord, "where is my Ark?"  A lightning  bolt<br>
crashed into the ground next to Noah.<br>
 <br>
"Lord, please forgive me!" begged Noah.  "I did my best.  But there were<br>
big<br>
problems.  First I had to get a building permit for the Ark construction<br>
project, and your plans didn't meet code.  So I had to hire an engineer to<br>
redraw the plans.  Then I got into a big fight over whether or not the Ark<br>
needed a fire sprinkler system.  My neighbors objected, claiming I was<br>
violating zoning by building the Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a<br>
variance from the city planning commission.<br>
 <br>
Then I had a big problem getting enough wood for the Ark because there was<br>
a<br>
ban on cutting trees to save the Spotted Owl.  I had to convince U.S. Fish<br>
and Wildlife that I  needed the wood to save the owls.  But they wouldn't<br>
let<br>
me catch any owls.  So no owls. Then the carpenters formed a union and went<br>
out on strike.  I had to negotiate a settlement with the National Labor<br>
Relations Board before anyone would pick up a saw or a hammer.  Now we <br>
have<br>
16 carpenters going on the boat, and still no owls.<br>
 <br>
Then I started  gathering up animals, and got sued by an animal rights<br>
group.<br>
 They objected to me taking only two of each kind.  Just when I got the<br>
suit<br>
dismissed, EPA notified me that I couldn't complete the Ark without filing<br>
an<br>
environmental impact statement on your proposed flood.  They didn't take<br>
kindly to the idea that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of a<br>
Supreme Being.  Then the Army Corps of Engineers wanted a map of the<br>
proposed<br>
new flood plain.  I sent them a globe.<br>
 <br>
Right now I'm still trying to resolve a complaint from the Equal Employment<br>
 Opportunity Commission over how many Croatians I'm supposed to hire, the<br>
IRS<br>
has seized all my assets claiming I'm trying to avoid paying taxes by<br>
leaving<br>
the country, and I just got a notice from the state about owing some kind<br>
of<br>
use tax.  I really don't think I can finish your Ark for at least another<br>
five years," Noah wailed.<br>
 <br>
The sky began to clear.  The sun began to shine.  A rainbow arched across<br>
the<br>
sky.  Noah looked up and smiled.  "You mean you're not going to destroy the<br>
earth?" Noah asked, hopefully.<br>
 <br>
"No," said the Lord sadly, "Government already has."<br>
