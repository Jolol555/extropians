Please no!  It's bad enough having people who think they can talk on their<br>
phones and walk at the same time, but reading!?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I can let the machine read my mail, and dictate responses. </i><br>

Making <br>

<p>
Why, exactly, do you need a head-up and a head tracker to replace paper ?<br>
 When was the last time you walk around with paper stuck to your face ?<br>
 (don't answer).  Here's a good replacement for paper, paper!  Smart paper,<br>
made from thin, flexible displays or smart ink.  You can pick it up, write on<br>
it, save the document and leave it for the next person.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; People yearn for wearables. They just don't know it yet. </i><br>
<p>
I think people know exactly what they want - something that works, something<br>
that makes life easier.  I think one of the reasons why they aren't getting<br>
what they want is the acceptance that computers are complex, difficult<br>
machines.<br>
<p>
Can anyone tell me why an SG O2, a professional workstation, is easier to<br>
setup, install, use and upgrade than a home PC ?  It's not the cost!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Now this is a challenge for marketing.</i><br>
<p>
It's a lot to ask from an industry seems to spend more time making colorful<br>
icons than making computers that don't crash, files that don't corrupt and<br>
applications that don't just decide to 'loose all unsaved information'.  <br>
