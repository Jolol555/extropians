"Besides their role in sex, the sex chromosomes (particularly the X<br>
chromosome) carry other genes whose functions are quite different.  For<br>
example, there are several genes on the X chromosome responsible for<br>
producing the light-sensitive pigments in the cone cells of our retinas, and<br>
another gene for one of the proteins concerned with bloodclotting.  The fact<br>
that these genes are on the X chromosome means that their inheritance is<br>
sex-linked (specially, that males inherit these genes from their mothers,<br>
not their fathers), but they are not functionally concerned with sex or<br>
sexual behavior in any way.  Correspondingly, ther are many genes on the<br>
autosomes that are concerned with sex, but their actions are controlled (via<br>
a long chain of causes and effects ) by TDE."<br>
