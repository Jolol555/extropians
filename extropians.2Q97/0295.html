Here's some nut who agrees with Kris.  The inaccuracies and distortions <br>
in it are pointed out in rec.aviation.military.<br>

Organization: Arizona Desert<br>
<p>
An A-10 pilot decides to fly to Colorado. With 4 500 lb bombs. Why?<br>
<p>
The pilot was going to "take out" The Denver Federal Courthouse, and<br>
Timothy McVeigh. However, the Air Force, to prevent such a renegade act,<br>
shot him down.<br>
<p>
The pilot, Button, was single. He was normally stationed in Texas, which is<br>
very close to Oklahoma City, OK. Perhaps Lt. Button had a relation in the<br>
Alfred Murro Federal Building (which was blown up by McVeigh last year) and<br>
he is just now enacting his revenge. The Fed. Courthouse in Colorado has<br>
been "hardened" from attack on or underground. But from the air? <br>
<p>
The A-10 flew almost a dirct route towards Vail. I doubt the pilot had the<br>
necessary sectional charts with him for that portion of Denver, since his<br>
OPS were supposed to be at the Goldwater Bombing Range near Gila Bend. In a<br>
moment of silence, he aimed his plane in an approximate NNE direction and<br>
set autopilot for the long haul.<br>
<p>
Now consider that the airplane, flying at a decent altitude, was painting<br>
radar screens all over the southwest! Especially since it did not have its<br>
transponder or IFF equipment activated. Don't you think the ATCs at Sky<br>
Harbor and Albuquerque were pulling their hair out with this craft?!?!<br>
Especially since it was going way too fast for a civilian joy-pilot.<br>
However, the Air Force has been rather silent about THEIR capability to<br>
track! Luke AFB, Yuma MCAS, Davis-Montham AFB would have been tracking him<br>
with their own powerful radars (plus any associated with bases in NewMexico<br>
like Holloman or White Sands; Colorado; and Wyoming).<br>
<p>
After about half an hour of flight, (which puts the A-10 in NE Arizona) the<br>
Air Force finally figures out they have a renegade. Sure, they probably<br>
tried to talk him down, but he is commited! They finally scramble either<br>
F-15s, F-16s, or FB-111s from either Luke, or bases in Wyoming or Nebraska<br>
to intercept. <br>
<p>
Now we know the pilot had to have been flying due to circling manuevers<br>
outside of Vail. He was either getting his bearings for an attack run on<br>
Denver (remember..it's after lunch recess at the Jury selection) or he is<br>
aware of the interceptors, and is now defending himself through stealth<br>
means (since he has no air-air capability).<br>
<p>
All aircraft are outfitted with ELTs (Emergency Locator Transmitters) that<br>
are quite capable of withstanding crashes, and activate during one emitting<br>
a radio beacon that can be picked up by searchers or a satellite. If the<br>
A-10 merely crashed, where is the ELT? The fighters shot down the A-10,<br>
utilizing missiles to create a secondary explosion onboard the craft with<br>
the 500 lb bombs. Even though the bombs may not have been "armed", they are<br>
still packed with explosives!<br>
<p>
This enormous explosion probably went unnoticed due to the unusual<br>
snowstorm and terrain of the Rocky Mountains. If the wreckage is exentually<br>
found, but scattered, then it was shot down. Localized wreckage will<br>
indicate a mere collision mid-air with a mountain.<br>
<p>
Why would the Air Force do such a thing? Consider the embarrassment! The<br>
nation would be outraged, and the Air Force en masse would be grounded<br>
pending hearings and investigations. Also the potential "cover-up" would<br>
only involve a small group of pilots, controllers, and officers.<br>
<p>
