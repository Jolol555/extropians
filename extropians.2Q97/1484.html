<i>&gt;Why not? With a good headup, I can read while walking on the street.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can let the machine read my mail, and dictate responses. There is lots of</i><br>
<i>&gt;small, irritating waits which can be utilized much better.</i><br>
<p>
I simply can't walk and read a book at the same time (not without hurting<br>
myself). (OK, I would like to fix that, but I don't see how wearables is the<br>
solution.) <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Making tree killing obsolete is impossible without a good head-up, and a head</i><br>
<i>&gt;tracker, and both are impossible without a wearable. I'd kill for a good wearable.</i><br>
<p>
Paper will not be reaplaced by wearables. Paper will be replaced by nothing<br>
less than Paper++. It must match price, resolution, weight and size. Paper<br>
is actually one of most impressive technologies we have today. But lets get<br>
back to wearables...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Me, I simply don't get mad. But the Newt2000 is just an expensive toy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(The Newt130 is an unusable prototype.)</i><br>
<p>
Agreed (but I like them both :-). But why is the Newt130 unusable?<br>
Because it doesn't communicate well. It's just a fancy filofax. But the<br>
Real filofax is built on the superior paper technology, which makes<br>
it much better. A real filofax doesn't pretend to do email. I think the<br>
Newton story well shows that it's connectivity that matters, not<br>
computation.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Speak for yourself. Working in the park, in the meadow, in the mountains. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Untethered.</i><br>
<p>
Or as Churchill would have put it, "We shall work on to the end. We shall work<br>
in France and on the seas and oceans; we shall work growing MHz and growing<br>
Mbit in the air; We shall compile our code whatever the cost may be; we shall<br>
work on beaches, landing grounds, in fields, in streets and on the hills; We shall<br>
never disconnect".<br>
