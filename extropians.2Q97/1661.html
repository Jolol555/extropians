One good news/bad news aspect of uploading is that it should be possible<br>
to run the simulation a lot faster than an organic brain.  Rather than<br>
electrochemical activity which switches on the order of milliseconds,<br>
electronic circuits can switch in nanoseconds these days.  You might be<br>
able to have your brain sped up by thousands or even millions.<br>
<p>
The down side is that this does not confer any immediate advantage on you.<br>
In and of itself, running faster does not improve your quality of life.<br>
What it does give you is a potential competitive advantage if you are<br>
thinking faster than other people.  So if the future world is one in which<br>
competition is a significant factor, there will be pressure to run your<br>
brain as fast as you can.<br>
<p>
This is too bad, because actually in most ways the quality of life will<br>
be worse for the super-fast brain.  From the brain's point of view, it<br>
is as though the rest of the world is slowed down by a huge factor.<br>
Everything will be slow - computers, communication, any manipulation of<br>
the physical world.  If you need to do experiments to learn more about<br>
nature, they will take (subjective) centuries to complete.  If you want<br>
to access those miraculous libraries from around the world, better plan<br>
on (subjective) minutes or hours to get results.  No more instant access.<br>
If you expect to live in a nifty VR, think again: computers will be a<br>
million times slower (subjectively) which will limit the quality of the<br>
simulations they can provide.  You may have to live in a cartoon world.<br>
<p>
Some people look at this and say, "yeah, but I can get centuries of<br>
work and thinking done in a single day!"  I say, "wow, it will take<br>
subjective centuries for even a single day's worth of change in the<br>
physical world."  I hope you like the weather, because you're going to<br>
be stuck with it for a while.<br>
