<i>&gt; &gt; Let's take some simple "smart drug", for example.  How hard would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it be to find a dozen people, give them some simple cognitive skill</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tests, then give half the drug and half a placebo, give the tests</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; again, and print all the numbers?  We could do it in a few hours</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; at a party, and repeat the ones that showed promise to get better</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sample size.   The fact that numbers like these are never printed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; makes me suspicious of the whole supplement industry.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is a good example why it is easy to get fooled by small studies. In</i><br>
<i>&gt; the above case, you implictly assume that the drug will have effect quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; immediately (most medical models suggest it takes weeks), and if you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; not doing it double-blind you are quite likely to influence the subjects.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But the general idea is sound. We at Aleph have been thinking of doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; "consumer testing" of smart drinks like Magic or Red Bull, comparing test</i><br>
<i>&gt; results before and after, and adding comments about taste, price and</i><br>
<i>&gt; nutrients. Maybe we transhumanists could work together on something like</i><br>
<i>&gt; this? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, I left out some details, but in principle it shouldn't be too hard.<br>
I did a similar thing once: I was having some insomnia, and my mother<br>
(whom I love and admire, but who will fall for anything) suggested I try<br>
melatonin.  I gave her some specific instructions: tell her assistant at<br>
work (whom I was not likely to meet in the month ahead) to go to the<br>
local drug pusher (GNC) and get a bottle of melatonin and a bottle of<br>
something similar-looking but inert, transfer the pills to envelopes<br>
marked A and B, then give them to me, where I'll try one for a couple<br>
of weeks and then the other, and record things like what time I got to<br>
work, how much time I spend online (a rough measure of how much time I<br>
spend awake!), my subjective impression of how I feel at night, etc.<br>
Not quite double-blind because she sees her assistant every day, and a<br>
sample size of 1 isn't very impressive, but it's still better than the<br>
kilopages of magazine articles on the stuff.<br>
<p>
The result was that I found my insomnia did in fact go away, but under<br>
both the drug and the placebo, so it was probably just due to the<br>
ritual of taking something and going to bed at a regular time nightly,<br>
not due to anything the drug did.  Of course, a larger study over a<br>
longer period of time might well show some real effect, but I was at<br>
least satisfied that I wouldn't benefit much from continuous outlay<br>
of money on melatonin.<br>
