Robin Hanson posted about his new paper "Disagreements are about <br>
Computation, Not Information".<br>
<p>
Not being Postscript-enabled, and somewhat mathematically challenged <br>
(both informational AND computational limitations on my part (-:), I'd <br>
like to try and understand this a bit better (in English, if <br>
possible).<br>
<p>
&lt;Consider two agents who want to be Bayesians with a common prior, but <br>
who can not due to computational limitations.&gt;<br>
<p>
I suspect this should actually read "a [set of] common prior <br>
[probabilities]". Or, perhaps, we are failing to communicate due to <br>
informational limitations (unfamiliarity with terminology on my <br>
part)?<br>
<p>
It seems to me that your discussion must be limited to two experts who <br>
can agree on the context of the problem being addressed.  An expert <br>
and a non-expert would not share the common background information <br>
that would make application to the discussion of additional evidence <br>
practical with Bayesian techniques.<br>
<p>
&lt;If these agents agree that they can reason abstractly about the fact <br>
that they have these limitations, then they can only agree to disagree <br>
about their estimate of a random variable if they agree to disagree <br>
(to a similar degree) about both their average biases.&gt;<br>
<p>
Are these computational limitations you speak of the situation where <br>
one party may not have the time or temperament to perform a complete <br>
or correct inductive analysis?<br>
<p>
Or, is one party simply unfamiliar with the formal analysis approach <br>
and unable to *formulate* the necessary computation?<br>
<p>
If the latter, isn't this, rather, an informational limitation?<br>
<p>
On the one hand, with your emphasis on computational limitations, I <br>
get the feeling that you're agreeing with many of the posters on this <br>
thread that "common-sense" reasoning would be a different <br>
computational approach from Bayesian analysis, even if the two parties <br>
both had the same prior "information".<br>
<p>
LDC 970325:<br>
&lt;I will also admit that it is quite possible that the number of <br>
decisions I make using conscious reasoning is numerically overwhelmed <br>
by those I make sub-consciously by simply following whatever memes <br>
happen to floating in the soup.&gt;<br>
<p>
Curt Adams 970326:<br>
&lt;The obvious conclusion is that most if not all people do not use even <br>
a passable approximation of Bayesian inference. I'd say most if not <br>
all people have their opinions driven by memetic replication (as <br>
exemplified by fashion and religion) and not a passable Bayesian <br>
approximation.&gt;<br>
<p>
And, more recently on another thread, Steve Witham put it this way:<br>
&lt;you'll be lead into finding that the value (in hypothesized beings) <br>
that is identical to what you (the analyzer) call success, will be the <br>
one with the most stability, and everything else might as well be <br>
coded (in your analysis) as ideas of how to achieve it.&gt;<br>
<p>
So, on the other hand, are you trying to show, vis a vis what Curt <br>
said, that normal "memetic replication" actually *does* end up <br>
equating to "a passable approximation of Bayesian inference"?<br>
<p>
On 970326 you wrote to Lee (regarding his argument that using <br>
inference to judge whether inference works best is a circular <br>
argument):<br>
&lt;Come now, your behavior here seems a good example of the error of <br>
refusing to give any weight to the opinions of others, unless they <br>
present to you, at your convenience and in a form you can quickly <br>
understand, all the evidence behind their opinions.&gt;<br>
<p>
It seems to me, as well, that sensible people will accept expert <br>
opinions on some complex subject *only if* it can be presented in a <br>
context they can understand.  Isn't this a problem of using the <br>
appropriate level of communication (information) rather than a <br>
different type of computation (reasoning)?<br>
<p>
It's not that I (or the average person) want(s) to ignore expert <br>
opinions, it is simply that we can not make any use of them if they <br>
can not put into terms we can understand.  This is why I would tend to <br>
say that, *in general*, disagreement is a matter of informational <br>
rather than (or as well as) computational limitations.<br>

P.S. For those who might be interested, there is a descent overview <br>
called "A Short Exposition on Bayesian Inference and Probability" by <br>
