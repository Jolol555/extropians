<i>        &gt;How does cryonics preserve the information in the brain?</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
We don't know for a fact that it does, but there is reason for optimism.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;It appears to me that given the amount of time required to get the         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;chemical/ionic potentials in the brain to approach something         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;resembling equilibrium.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Electro-chemical circuits in the brain are almost certainly not used for <br>
long term memory, people who have survived powerful electrical shocks can <br>
remember little about the 10 minutes or so before their accident but their <br>
long term memory is not harmed. The most important storage mechanism of the  <br>
brain is thought by most to be Long Term Potentiation ( LTP). It theorizes  <br>
that memory is encoded by varying the strength of the 10^14 synapses that  <br>
connect the 10^11 neurons in the human brain. We now know that when one  <br>
synapse undergoes LTP it spreads out to other synapses (the LTP signal is  <br>
sent by the diffusion of nitric oxide). This means there must be a large <br>
amount of redundancy in the storage mechanism of memory and that could help <br>
a lot if we want to repair a badly damaged frozen brain.<br>
                <br>

<p>
<p>
LTP involves a change in the structure  of synapses.<br>

<i>        &gt;just slowing it down?  If there was small but finite transport         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;activity, it would put a "shelf-life" on information stored in a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;cryo-brain.</i><br>
                <br>
<p>
Chemical reactions at liquid Nitrogen temperatures would be so slow that the <br>
damage from natural background radiation would probably be more important. <br>
Even so, your shelf life should be hundreds if not thousands of years. <br>
Of more concern to me are non technical questions, like will I really remain <br>
at liquid Nitrogen temperature until the age of Nanotechnology and will<br>
anybody or anything think I'm worth the trouble of reviving, the cost, like <br>
everything at that time, would not be much but it would not be zero.<br>
