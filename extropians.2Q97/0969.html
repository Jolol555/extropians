Not true; there's no B12 and it's a little difficult to get a couple of<br>
minerals like zinc.  In many respect (most vitamins) vegan diets do indeed<br>
tend to be excellent.  Protein is a non-issue; you'll get enough protein from<br>
almost any natural diet.<br>

<p>
You should check up on that.  I've yet to see any scientific references on<br>
food combining.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;You know what the worst food combination is?  Meat and potatoes.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;chemicals in each cancel out the digestive chemicals in your stomach,</i><br>
<i>&gt;becoming undigestibabl and rotting in your stomach and intestines for a day</i><br>

<p>
This is horsehockey.  The digestive chemicals in your stomach are<br>
hydrochloric and butyric acid.  Neither meat nor potatoes (nor any other food<br>
you'd eat) will cancel that.  <br>
<p>
It's a pity, really.  Calorie restriction is a great way to extend lifespan.<br>
 If all I had to do was to eat meat and potatoes together and nothing would<br>
get digested, I'd be set.<br>
