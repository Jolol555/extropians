<i>&gt; the next millennium immediately went awry (along with almost everyone</i><br>
<i>&gt; else's) by assuming that the principal challenger to American suzerainty in</i><br>

If you'll notice the periods of conflict you describe, each typically<br>
involves two major conflicts. The first is typically a contest to<br>
determine the "winner" of the previous period of relative peace, or to<br>
put to sleep an outmoded form of governance or competition, while the<br>
second conflict is to determine the area of competition for the next<br>
period, and the manner in which it is conducted.<br>
<p>
Likewise, using the 1973-2030 period as the present age of conflict, we<br>
see the first conflict being the determinance of the obsolescence of<br>
totalitarian communism, starting with detente and the final phases of<br>
the arms race in 1973 and culminating in 1990 with the fall of the<br>
Soviet Union and the Iron Curtain (symbolized in the Berlin Wall), being<br>
bankrupted to exhaustion by continuous arms buildups that are never used<br>
to profit in gained imperial resource bases. The second conflict is to<br>
determine what the future face of capitalist markets will be. Will they<br>
be authoritarian nationalist/mercantilist economies, or shall<br>
libertarianism and free markets reign? <br>
This conflict will most likely be between the US and China as the main<br>
players. The initial front lines in reality will be in the Asian Tiger<br>
economies of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Indochina, and the<br>
Phillipines/Indonesia. With the ubiquitousness of the internet,<br>
cyberweapons systems will proliferate, with electronic combat waged<br>
around the planet, with AI's and/or uploaded minds becoming the<br>
equivalent of the atomic bomb that will resolve the conflict. That the<br>
2030 timepoint coincides with our best estimates of acheivment of what<br>
some call the "singularity" indicates that whoever gets there first will<br>
win this conflict.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps the most striking feature of this century-long process is the role</i><br>
<i>&gt; played by massive conflict, or more exactly its successful conclusion, as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; definitive time-marker.  Whether or not the long cycle is calibrated to</i><br>
<i>&gt; more primitive pulses (physiologic, ecological, even solar), one can set</i><br>
<i>&gt; its clock by the celebrations that mark global armistice.</i><br>
