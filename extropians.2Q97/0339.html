I was in dictionary mode - nothing so vulgar as *data* or *facts*.<br>
<p>
I would guess that the impact of poststructuralism does still shape<br>
humanities' depts.  One of the routine put-downs I repeatedly heard around<br>
the literature end of the academy, blood-curdling and chilling, was:`mere<br>
empiricism'.  Yeah, right, I'd say, I'm troubling your doctrine with facts<br>
(yetch)... so sorry.  But `facts' are just culturally-bound<br>
interpretations, I'd be told.  In such a climate, I don't imagine<br>
cliometrics would do very well.  On the other hand, poststruck doctrine<br>
seems to be increasingly on the nose, so the tide might be about to turn.<br>
(And the new models emerging from complexity theory are likely to attract<br>
interest back to *measurement*, aren't they?  Or will that be just a new<br>
scholasticism as well?)<br>
