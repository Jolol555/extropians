"Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so<br>
each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the<br>
entire tapestry."  Richard P. Feynman<br>
\\//<br>
Consider coming up to your car, and inserting your personal<br>
key into the door lock. The induction loop around the keyhole<br>
provides juice for the teensy transponder chip embedded within<br>
the key. Talk to me. Interrogated by the lock, it quotes<br>
chapter, and verse, and sets your seat's digital motorics<br>
into motion, buzzing your seat to envelop your buttocks<br>
optimally, targeting user-associated configuration space point<br>
last remembered (and mind that the seat stops moving by time<br>
your ass has made a 3pt touchdown, as everything else might<br>
-- uh oh -- upset the customer). Thai-Ming.<br>
<p>
Analogous thing happens when you start the engine. The key has<br>
a Philips transponder, offering 128 Bytes of rw memory. After key<br>
ID is written, this segment's write protection bit is turned on.<br>
Irreversibly. Codes issued, icbms in transit, all fucked.<br>
<p>
The key contains a key, a random token. Using a hardware random<br>
(a free-running counter with a couple of extra mangling) a<br>
new token in generated, and written into the transponder. Each<br>
time you use your key, lest flash/E^2 oxide layer abandon ye.<br>
If you want to start your car, and the token within the EWS and<br>
the key won't match, the engine won't start. Awwww. The unit<br>
knows a subspace of 10 keys, having inherited it from a central<br>
dbase (so don't lose your keys too often, it might require a<br>
visit at Joe's). And of course one can't read systems's memory<br>
by diagnosis packets over the bus. Orelse this would be too simple.<br>
<p>
This is not sf, btw. Just a high-end limousine extra.<br>
Coming soon\\<br>
to your Datsun. (Attention: here comes the sf part).<br>
<p>
Consider implanting a bionert trasponder implant into your wrist. Not his<br>
master's voice, his master's touch. TACK. Next, please. (Though you might<br>
consider this to be large horned male bovine excrement, many members of<br>
the abovementioned tribe already wear transponder emplants (and it even<br>
were't the Greys)). <br>
<p>
Each device you own now knows you. Intimately. Either rendering<br>
unauthorized use impossible (why not by void SYS_detonate()? (of<br>
_course_ void. Which return value if there is nothing to return<br>
to?)), or instantly coming up with your customized environment,<br>
for multi-user devices. Useful, eh?<br>
<p>
Then comes the guy with katana and a plastic sack, and you've<br>
lost your keys. _And_ your arms. (Both, for the guy does not<br>
know what your dominant arm is). Shit. Shit. Shit. And no clone<br>
transplant insurance.<br>
<p>
Hmm... How about a piezo crystal in the transponder? You tap the<br>
code (which even generates piezojuice), and lock/unlock the<br>
particular key(s) from a ring. (If you walk around with all your<br>
keys armed, you certainly deserve what happens to you). Or consider<br>
making a biosig fingerprint part of key. Retina, finger, voice,<br>
mugshot.  "Kindly place your palm on the rectangular window,<br>
gazetrack the 3cursor, and repeat after me: Betty Botter...<br>
No, sorry, I _cannot_ let you drive your car. Your sonogram<br>
says you are hoarse, and mass-spectro of your breath indicates<br>
presence of ethanol breakdown metabolites. Residual alcohol<br>
level estimate gained from your body mass (you gained weight<br>
since yesterday, _again_) says your reaction latency to be<br>
sufficiently inhibited to render you incapable for car driving.<br>
Have a nice day."<br>
<p>
(Of course there is torture. But there is no perfect security,<br>
and one can always consider zeroing the flash by means an<br>
biofeedback-learned EEG signal. Ok, this means one must render<br>
your unconscious (by whatever means) asap, but there _is_ no<br>
perfect security. Did I already say that?).<br>
<p>
