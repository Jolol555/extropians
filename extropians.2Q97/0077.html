Human Chromosome Created Artificially<br>
 Science: Technology is called a major advance in study of genes. It may<br>
offer a way to cure inherited diseases.<br>

n a major milestone in the study of human heredity,<br>
researchers announced Monday that they have created the<br>
first artificial human chromosome, which experts said represents a<br>
quantum leap in the ability to probe the complex molecules that<br>
make up humankind.<br>
     The new technology offers scientists a powerful new research<br>
tool for investigating fundamental questions about the chemistry<br>
responsible for human heredity, experts said.<br>
     Its inventors at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland<br>
and Athersys Inc. hope the techniques may also offer a way to cure<br>
inherited diseases by altering a cell's genetic structure, bypassing<br>
biochemical stumbling blocks that have so far stymied efforts to<br>
accomplish that task.<br>
     As a medical tool, a custom-tailored chromosome could<br>
potentially be used as a package for introducing a therapeutic gene<br>
into a cell. The new gene could either replace a defective gene or<br>
generate a medicinal protein.<br>
     In research published today in Nature Genetics, the researchers<br>
said they were able to use the human cell itself to perform the<br>
trickiest portion of creating a synthetic chromosome. The scientists<br>
basically gave the cell a molecular construction kit developed after a<br>
decade of experiments and let the cell do the actual work of<br>
assembling it.<br>
     On at least two occasions, the result was a new artificial human<br>
chromosome, the researchers reported.<br>
     A normal cell has 22 pairs of natural chromosomes--threadlike<br>
structures inherited from an individual's parents that contain the<br>
genes that guide the body's growth and development. An additional<br>
pair determine gender. Natural chromosomes are built in pieces,<br>
made up of hundreds or even thousands of genes, bracketed by<br>
special protein structures that enhance the structure's stability and<br>
guide its functions--turning genes on and off, for example. Taken<br>
altogether, the natural chromosomes contain roughly 100,000<br>
separate genes--the molecular blueprint for human development.<br>
     The artificial chromosome appears to co-exist with the natural<br>
ones. It appears to divide and multiply normally, surviving as a kind<br>
of accessory chromosome for at least six months, the researchers<br>
said.<br>
     French Anderson, a molecular biologist at USC who helped<br>
pioneer the concept of human gene therapy, called the new research<br>
"a very important advance." The invention of synthetic human<br>
chromosomes is, he said, "the next big step."<br>
     Melissa A. Rosenfeld, a senior researcher at the National<br>
Genome Research Institute, called it "an important landmark."<br>
     Officials at Athersys said they hope eventually to use artificial<br>
chromosomes as a way to package treatments for diseases affecting<br>
the human immune system, like AIDS, as well as blood disorders<br>
like sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia.<br>
     If the technology proves itself clinically, it could be applied to an<br>
even wider range of inherited or infectious diseases, they said.<br>
     Anderson, who is working with the pharmaceutical firm Novartis<br>
on a competing gene therapy technique, cautioned, however, that<br>
the danger of chromosomal abnormalities may be too high to make<br>
artificial chromosomes work as a medical product. In addition, the<br>
manufacturing problems in producing complex chromosomes in<br>
industrial quantities may be too formidable, he said.<br>
     Even so, he said, artificial human chromosomes would be a<br>
powerful tool to help fathom the mysteries of human genetics.<br>
     The discovery comes at a time when researchers engaged in the<br>
federal Human Genome Project are rapidly charting the unexplored<br>
regions of the human genetic structure, determining where each<br>
human gene is located.<br>
     But mapping a gene is only the first step in determining what it<br>
does in the larger universe of the human body, researchers said.<br>
Despite their high-speed gene machines and DNA microprocessor<br>
chips, scientists know more about where genes are located--having<br>
mapped more than 16,000 human genes so far--than they do about<br>
how they function.<br>
     Even with their rudimentary knowledge of individual genes,<br>
researchers have been able to create a bestiary of novel life forms,<br>
from genetically engineered crops to bacteria that produce drugs for<br>
humans. But until now, scientists had no way to assemble human<br>
genes together with all the chemical elements necessary to their<br>
proper function, the way nature does in the large daisy-chains of<br>
protein and DNA that make up a human chromosome.<br>
     "This opens the door to be able to study human genes in their<br>
normal context--as part of a chromosome," said Huntington F.<br>
Willard, chairman of the Case Western Reserve genetics<br>
department and leader of the research team.<br>
     The Case Western Reserve team and Athersys, the team's<br>
privately held business partner, have patented the new technology<br>
and are seeking patents on the artificial chromosomes.<br>
     For more than a decade, gene experts have been able to<br>
assemble the chromosomes that guide the simplest living<br>
organisms--yeast, for example.<br>
     Last year, researchers at Chromos Molecular Systems created<br>
the first mammalian chromosomes, stitching together the gene<br>
packages that shape a mouse. By February, the company had<br>
completed a manufacturing plant capable of churning out 3 million to<br>
5 million of them a day.<br>
     But the chemical essence of a human chromosome had eluded<br>
researchers until now.<br>
     To make a human chromosome, the Case Western Reserve<br>
researchers added to a normal human cell separate portions of<br>
ordinary DNA, protein structures called telomeres, which help<br>
protect the chromosome from damage, and other structures called<br>
centromeres, which help control the way a chromosome divides and<br>
reproduces.<br>
     The cell did the rest.<br>
     "We were letting nature takes its course," Willard said. "For all<br>
intents and purposes, they are 'real' chromosomes . . . to our<br>
delight."<br>

     Hacking the Human Chromosome<br>
     Researchers created the first working artificial human<br>
chromosome by inserting the raw material into a normal human<br>
cell--ordinary DNA, telomeres and centromeres--which then<br>
assembled a working package of genes.<br>
