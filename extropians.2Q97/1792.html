Only if the cycles are defined with sufficent imprecision.  Here's a<br>
cyclical theory that is suffciently precise to be disproved: the rate of<br>
growth of the French population has oscillated from psotive to negative with<br>
a 47-year period since the twelfth century.  I just made this theory up, and<br>
it's probably false.<br>
But it's hardly vacuous.  <br>

Begin analogy:<br>
<p>
But geography is continuous, one kilometer after another, no one kilometer<br>
any different than any other kilometer, every kilometer of equal length.  No<br>
kilometer is to be given a privileged position when starting a cyclical<br>
analysis.  There is no "basin/range alternation" identifiable anywhere<br>
except in relation to yourself and yourself alone.  To arbitrarily assert<br>
otherwise is to commit a category error in analysis.<br>
<p>
End analogy.<br>
<p>
A generation is a theoretical concept used by people who try to explain<br>
history.    I don't see why it's a category error to construct such a<br>
concept, and then argue that it provides a correct theory.  What two<br>
categories are you claiming to have been confused in this case? <br>
