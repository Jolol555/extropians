Actually at the moment my model has constant creativity, and it is the<br>
criticism which slides freely.  If you call random spew creativity, but<br>
I suspect that is what it must amount to under the hood.  When you're<br>
tired you're not too focused, more ideas get through, you feel more<br>
creative, and some of them might even be good.  When you're sleeping<br>
you're not focused at all and your mind goes on a random walk.  That it<br>
makes as much sense as it seems to do while you're asleep is probably<br>
due to our neural networks desperately trying to find patterns.  If<br>
you're too tightly focused and critical not enough ideas are allowed to<br>
live long enough.<br>
<p>
Hallucinogens perhaps actively affect the creation of ideas, vs. simply<br>
tearing down the critical walls; I wouldn't know.  For my purposes a<br>
constant source of idealets with varying intensity and quality of<br>
surrounding filters works as a model, so far.<br>
<p>
Smart people have more dumb ideas than dumb people, because dumb people<br>
don't have ideas.  Really smart people, of course, recognize their dumb<br>
ideas before they open their mouth.<br>

That last sentence was not meant as a jibe at anyone specific.  <br>

Perhaps you are thinking: "But a tank costs several million dollars,<br>
  not including floor mats. I don't have that kind of money."<br>
Don't be silly. You're a consumer, right? You have credit cards, right?<br>
Perhaps you are thinking: "Yes, but how am I going to pay the credit-card<br>
  company?"<br>
