<i>&gt;  	We already live in a cartoon world!  (Although I prefer to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  call it a spiritual world).  Everything we are directly aware of is</i><br>
<i>&gt;  reproduced inside our brain via the data collected by our senses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  This entire world that is our conscious knowledge is inside our brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  You aren't directly aware of that tree out beyond your eyes.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;  can't be because the information flows into your eyes, not out of!</i><br>
<i>&gt;  You only have a phenomenal representation of that tree in your cartoon</i><br>
<i>&gt;  world inside your brain.  When you stub your toe, the pain isn't in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the real toe, that would be impossible.  The pain is inside the cartoon</i><br>
<i>&gt;  toe that is inside this cartoon world that is entirely inside your</i><br>
<i>&gt;  head.  All this stuff only represents what is out beyond your senses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  	There is no color, smell, warmth, pain and so on and so forth</i><br>
<i>&gt;  outside our brains.  This is all cartoon stuff. (I prefer to call it</i><br>
<i>&gt;  spiritual stuff) There is only the light, chemical content, vibrating</i><br>
<i>&gt;  molecules, and the destruction and such that these cartoon things only</i><br>
<i>&gt;  consciously represent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  	The exciting thing about uploading, is we will finally be able</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to escape from our lonely isolated cartoon worlds, that are trapped</i><br>
<i>&gt;  inside our skulls, into a unified and shared spiritual world of global</i><br>
<i>&gt;  consciousness</i><br>
<p>
However, the uploaded world will be a cartoon world, with no link to the<br>
physical.  It will be even less real than the 'spiritual' stuff you talk of.<br>
 None of the entities in the uploaded world would be seperate, nor would they<br>
be real.  They would be cartoon sets of abstract rules made to look like us!<br>
