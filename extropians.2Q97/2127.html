<i>&gt;This seems to me to be a very possible future, not one that I </i><br>
necessarily<br>

<i>&gt;Obviously some people here do, and I'd be interseted to hear more on </i><br>
why<br>
<i>&gt;they do.  I can deffinitely see a problem if the state is the one </i><br>
looking<br>

not<br>
<i>&gt;terribly concerned now if people know my business, and maybe that's </i><br>
just<br>
<i>&gt;naivete or my virtual lack of anything to hide, but if I'm living in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;community with standards of behavior that reflect my own, namely </i><br>
"crimes"<br>
<i>&gt;not comitted against property are not crimes, then I can't see why it</i><br>
<i>&gt;would make much difference if people can watch me go about my "private</i><br>
<i>&gt;life" at home, or elsewhere.  (pardon my long sentence, no time to </i><br>

I would like to think that as a society we could evolve to such a point <br>
that privacy was a non-issue.  Below is why I think it is still a major <br>
issue, and of great importance to me.<br>
<p>
  You can be assured that there is a sizable minority of people out <br>
there, who would view any of things you do in the privacy of your own <br>
home to be "immoral" and "wrong", and would like nothing better than to <br>
punish you severely. Just having sex with your partner in perhaps any <br>
position other than the missionary would be considered by many to be "an <br>
act against god" and worthy of your incarceration.  In several states in <br>
the south there are still people being put in jail for just such <br>
"unusual" sex acts.<br>
<p>
   I'll go out on a limb to say that I engage in some rather unusual <br>
antics around the house - from running around with jello on my naked <br>
body to talking in pseudo-languages while making outrageous jestures <br>
with my body and face, to just having crazy fun in whatever way my <br>
spirit moves me.  I also happen to perform very well on my job and am <br>
respected by my friends and collegues for being one of the sanest people <br>
they know.  However, if there were cameras in my house observing and <br>
recording my every move I'm sure the verdict would be quite different.  <br>
I would probably have a hard time getting hired anywhere "respectable".  <br>
Since I live in a rather small town, I might get chased out of it as <br>
well!<br>
