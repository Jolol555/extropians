Not really.  There were a couple of references years ago, but it was used by<br>
the writers for a writing flare to grab attention,  rather than term of used<br>
for substance and authenticity.  <br>

We have, as best we can.<br>
<p>

You have an exclamation point at the end of your example sentence.  It's the<br>
exclamation that looks and sounds defensive.  When corrections are made they<br>
need not come off as a freak-out or defense, but a comment of what is<br>
accurate or not.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are there any laws banning "cult" activities?  Should Extropians beware,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or I am just paraniod? </i><br>
<p>
I don't think we have anything to worry about as long as extropians don't<br>
refer to themselves as a cult.  I haven't seen that happen, because it is<br>
not a cult.  So if other people place inappropriate labels on us from time<br>
to time, the best thing is to act calmly and clear the misconception.<br>
