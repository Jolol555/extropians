<i>&gt; You appear to be arguing for the so-called "Cartesian Theater",</i><br>
<p>
	No, there is a sub being or homunculous in the cartesian<br>
theatre watching the show.  I'm not saying there is entity watching<br>
the show.  I'm saying the show is the conscious awarenes.  Our<br>
knowledge of the tree is the conscious representation of the tree in<br>
our mind.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Are you familiar with Dennett's arguments on the subject?</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, He basically argues that: we don't have qualia, "It just<br>
seems that we do".  (Quote from Consciousness explained.)<br>
<p>
	But this is absurd if you think about it.  An inacurate<br>
seeming is some conscious knowledge that we have that does not<br>
acurately model what it is suposed to represent.  So he is basically<br>
simply arguing we don't have qualia, we just have qualia that falsely<br>
represents the fact that we have qualia.  An obviously silly statement<br>
that assumes we have qualia to start with.<br>
