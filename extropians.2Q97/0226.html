<i>&gt;From: GeoffCobb@aol.com</i><br>
<i>&gt;Date: Sat, 29 Mar 1997 11:15:34 -0500 (EST)</i><br>

<i>&gt;mikec@jax.gulfnet.com (Mike C.)writes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Is memory of the event enough to cause guilt?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  It is an implanted memory programmed into it during creation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;This raises an interesting point. What is the PURPOSE of establishing guilt?</i><br>
<p>
Responsiblity,<br>
response ability,<br>
they want the ability to respond for the purpose of security.<br>
I guess some people believe in the concept of <br>
"It's your mess, you clean it up wether you want to or not.".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Interestingly, in Shawn's original post he inquired into the concept of</i><br>
<i>&gt;"punishment" -a hot topic in debate circles.</i><br>
<p>
Warning: vultures circle.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But the list did not pick up that thread.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Culpablitity means one has been rendered "harmful" </i><br>
<i>&gt;and punishment attempts to repair and pervent further harm.</i><br>
<p>
I think electricutions, firing squads, hangings, fatal injections, <br>
beheadings, dunkings, impalings, and crucifixions (need I go on?) <br>
are quite harmfull and have sent bodies into deep disrepair.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Is it even effective?</i><br>
<p>
If you kill the killer and there is an other a killer on the loose.<br>
I makes no difference to me if you have a "good-guy badge" or not.<br>
UN:UDoHR:Art.2:..."without distinction".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Can preventative measures be more effective? </i><br>
<p>
Do you want medicine that keeps you healthy,<br>
or medicine that makes you better after you are sick?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  Is capability of murder enough for guilt?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  Who is not capable of knifing some one?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This raises another ethics question: </i><br>
<p>
Ethics are informal laws.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do you past experiences make you what you are?</i><br>
<p>
I AM what I AM.<br>
I AM no longer what I WAS.<br>
I do not live in the past.<br>
Does the past even really exist?<br>
I have heard an Native American saying that roughly states,<br>
"There is only the now.".<br>
Presently there is only the present.<br>
Memories can be resonant waves.<br>
Is an echo my voice even after it has bounced off rocks and changed?<br>
No, it has changed due to reflection, refraction, and resonance.<br>
According to Webster a thing that has changed <br>
has by definition been made different.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(One comes upon this question when confronted with the OJ trials.)</i><br>
<p>
Deja vu.<br>
Did he use this as a line of defense?<br>
Why does it come up so often with this subject?<br>
The man is not guilty, it is official.<br>
He is to be presumed innocent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Most people would fear a known killer, they would judge him capable of</i><br>
<i>&gt;repeating the act - even expect it in some.</i><br>
<p>
If O.J. were guilty would he be able to kill her again?<br>
Do these people have the right to judge?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Re: the last question: </i><br>
<i>&gt;Many are capable, should we punish them before they do it?</i><br>
<p>
Are you sure they WILL?<br>
Do you know the future?<br>
The only ones that are truly capable <br>
are those that are supported<br>
by the laws of physics, nature, and nature's god.<br>
If you kill them before it is done they were not capable, <br>
not allowed by physics, nature, and nature's god, <br>
however likely it seemed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Many are not, should we punish them anyway?</i><br>
<p>
How many families can be destroyed by killing one person?<br>
How many will mourn?<br>
How many will war to kill the killers?<br>
If a government kills one person when will it stop?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you suggesting original sin?</i><br>
<p>
I suggest forgiveness and understanding.<br>
Please elaborate on original sin.<br>
I want to be sure I know what that implies.<br>
Would that imply humanity is evil <br>
and God was wrong when he said all was good?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;GC</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A clone is mental masterbation?</i><br>
<p>
I will interpret that as well as I can.<br>
<p>
If you are asking if clones are not identical( same)  <br>
I say yes they are not completly exact and totally true copies <br>
nor should they be considered <br>
a one soley singular person or conglomerate entity.<br>
Though they have similarities and common traits <br>
(chimps share a majority of genetic traits w/ humans)<br>
it only takes one difference to seperate their identities.<br>
Twins are two people even if they share a waist( Siamese twins).<br>
<p>
<p>
If you are asking if they are a waste of time, <br>
I say, in a major sense, yes.<br>
Cracking the genetic code for improvement is important to me. <br>
Reproducing the code we have now is not.<br>
98% of parents are unfit communicators, educators, and providers.<br>
Think of ALL the children who have EVER been desperate, homeless, sick,<br>
hungry, ignored, maladjusted, abused, enslaved, tortured, murdered( need I<br>
go on?).<br>
Remember 70 year olds are children too, every one has a parent/creator.<br>
<p>
We need to care for the children we have before we make more.<br>
The global community with easier access to communications <br>
will bring humanity together from the youth up.<br>
Teens are the ones on the net who grow up talking to people world-wide.<br>
They are the ones who will help each other when adults have failed.<br>
Point being we have enough unloved people.<br>
<p>
One good some what related aspect could come about <br>
if people become sterile and procreated solely via genetic engineering.<br>
That would decrease accidental, unwanted, unprepared for progeny.<br>
It would also pass on genes of choice.<br>
