I just finished reading Farrell's thought-provoking "The Myth of Male<br>
Power".  It made me realize that the genders have an awful lot of<br>
unfinished business.<br>
<p>
Once upon a time, people had relatively constant and predictable sex<br>
roles, allowing matching expectations.  More recently, these roles<br>
have been in flux, especially regarding women.  Many of us are<br>
confused because we are not sure where these changes are going, or<br>
where we want them to go.<br>
<p>
Now its all well and good to say that each person should choose the<br>
sex role they like best from all imaginable sex roles, but there is a<br>
big coordination issue here.  People are choosing many actions based<br>
on their expectations regarding the distribution of choices other<br>
people will make, now and in the future.  <br>
<p>
For example, we choose how to raise and educate our children, and<br>
people choose for themselves what sort of skills to invest in<br>
learning, in part based on expectations about who in the future will<br>
tend to raise future children, who will tend to defend us in war and<br>
on the street, who will work in contexts where teamwork and<br>
competition are at a premium, and who will do the unpleasant boring<br>
jobs.<br>
<p>
We also make various choices based on what we expect the opposite sex<br>
to be looking for in partners and relationships, and on who will be<br>
expected to initiate and take risks regarding the growth of such<br>
relationships.  And employers make choices about who to hire based on<br>
who is likely to have invested in what skills, and who is likely to<br>
stick with a job for how long.<br>
<p>
For example, employers who want long-term employees may be less<br>
interested in hiring women if women will tend more to leave jobs for<br>
child rearing.  Parents may be well-advised to have their sons suffer<br>
more from hazing, risk-taking and encourage them to do more team<br>
sports if they are more likely to be sent to war or to be employed in<br>
competitve team-oriented jobs.   And boys should learn more to suffer<br>
rejection if they are still going to be expected to initiate<br>
relationships. <br>
<p>
Now if we all knew that we were moving to a future with no substantial<br>
correlation between sex and roles in society, it would be wrong and<br>
unfair to train people for old sex roles.  But this may not be our<br>
future.  Maybe our genetic heritage implies that the sexes differ in<br>
what they *want*, such as perhaps women enjoying child rearing more.<br>
So the big questions are:  what do we want, and what can we expect?<br>
