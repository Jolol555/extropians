In recent mailings there has been talk of "changing the system from within"<br>
by an "Extropian Party" or something like that. I can almost guarantee you<br>
that this won't work, because (true) Extropians are such an incredibely<br>
small<br>
minority. In fact if Extropy were some suicidal CULT it would have more<br>
"followers"<br>
than it has now. Our "enemies" are not just the politicians and business<br>
conglomerates and their henchmen who rule the present "system", but also<br>
"the people" themselves. They are the ones who really hold the system up,<br>
and prevent important social/political/ economical/technological change.<br>
The reasons for this are of course a childish fear of "the unknown", an<br>
aversion to personal responsibility, pure laziness, stupidity and related<br>
negative characteristics. Indeed, most people prefer to huddle up<br>
under the ubusive wings of Big Brother, pretending to be safe, rather than<br>
to boldly and independently surge forwards in life, always looking for<br>
improvement. <br>
<p>
Therefore, any attempt to change the system from within is certain to fail,<br>
the<br>
progressive Extropian ideas simply lack a broad popular support.<br>
Consequently, Extropian politicians would be a small minority and thus an<br>
easy target for their less enlightened colleagues. Their progressive<br>
proposals would either be badly<br>
compromized, or be ignored/defeated.<br>
<p>
What are the alternatives then; doing nothing?  No, this would definately<br>
be very<br>
un-Extropian. "Dropping out", as has been suggested in earlier postings?<br>
Yes,<br>
only not as some kind of "lone individualist" living in the hills, but<br>
rather as a group<br>
of  ultra-progressive colonists. Whereto? Well, at first an ISLAND STATE<br>
would<br>
be the new Extropian homeland (something like the Libertarian Island, only<br>
preferably on an already existing island that would be bought. This is a<br>
lot easier<br>
and cheaper then the "floating concrete" variant). In this new state (with,<br>
of course,<br>
minimal government according to the enlightened Extropian principles) a<br>
highly<br>
advanced civilization could develop in relative peace and freedom,<br>
combining the best social/technological ideas the world has to offer.<br>
Cryonic suspensions would<br>
for instance be the norm, and would have full financial/legal backing by<br>
society<br>
and state. Other so-called "controversial procedures" like genetic<br>
manipulation,<br>
euthanasia (of course followed by suspension) and abortion could be<br>
performed<br>
in a safe and supporting environment. Due to the unusually high<br>
concentration of<br>
enlightened minds, the new state would soon be a hotbed of new ideas and<br>
technologies, and a mecca for brilliant researchers, artists, engineers,<br>
computer<br>
experts etc. etc. Also, many (legal/economical) advantages of having your<br>
own state would bring unprecedented wealth to it's inhabitants. Money that<br>
could at<br>
least partially be used to accelerate important research (like the<br>
Prometheus Project) and the next important step...the journey to and the<br>
colonization of MARS. <br>
<p>
Real freedom lies in space, and Mars seems like the most rational place to<br>
set<br>
up colonies, before venturing into "the great beyond". If the Extropians<br>
can make<br>
it to one of the planets, they can have their own HOMEWORLD, hopefully the<br>
first<br>
of many. Mars could be relatively easy terraformed by letting big chunks of<br>
ice<br>
crash on the surface -&gt; instant atmosphere (in theory, at least). The<br>
advantages<br>
of an Extropian homeworld are even greater than those of the island state,<br>
mainly<br>
because of the almost absolute freedom from the oppressive, backward<br>
"sheaple" back on earth, and their stifling, antiquated ideas.<br>
<p>
Of course the "conquest of Mars (and later space) would have to be done in<br>
phases; first preparing and executing trips to the moon, setting up lunar<br>
factories<br>
to built a large (rotating -&gt; artificial gravity) spaceship, testing<br>
spaceship, flight to<br>
Mars (photon/solid/liquid fuel propulsion, for instance), going in a high<br>
orbit above Mars, sending expeditions to set up colonies, while others<br>
search for ice (frozen H2O) to terraform Mars, terraforming and "adjustment<br>
period", inhabitation.<br>
<p>
Any "tough" future colonists (the real Extropians) out there? <br>
