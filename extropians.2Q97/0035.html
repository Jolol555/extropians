'Twas me.  Banks is a great writer in the page turning sense, and full<br>
of interesting and amusing conceits, but he does have a good old Red bee<br>
buzzing around in his bonnet.  <br>
<p>
I dunno if the Culture could stand co-existing with other Beyond<br>
cultures, at least not the way Banks describes it.  In fact, isn't<br>
Consider Phlebas about that very thing: a conflict between a kind of<br>
hold-out-for-individualism culture and the Culture?  Those Culture AIs<br>
are just too damn bossy!<br>
<p>
Actually there is something rather stirring about the idea of the<br>
Culture as the final fulfillment of Marxist prophecy.  ("Imagine, the<br>
old guy was right after all!")  It is also terribly Scottish, a Scottish<br>
form of socialism, that Banks upholds.  I know this because I was once<br>
of exactly the same mind.  There's something about Scottish people in<br>
general that is kind of naturally collectivist, voluntarily collectivist,<br>
in a friendly but robust way.<br>
<p>
Certainly, the key point about the Culture, its tremendous technological<br>
ability, its power beyond measure, couldn't be *arrived at* by a<br>
socialist path, since technological *progress* is a function of the kind<br>
of utility testing that only capitalist cultures allow.  But perhaps<br>
something like the Culture could be maintained once a given technological<br>
lift off point had been attained (esp. in AI), and could progress well<br>
enough. I suppose competition effects could be modelled in networked AIs<br>
beyond a certain stage of development: for example, imagine that there<br>
were subroutines that used spare resources across the entire network to<br>
model competition process continuously, reporting results every now and<br>
then to the AIs that set the processes in motion, so they wouldn't even<br>
have to think about it, just let the processes run.<br>
<p>
Darwinism all the way up and down.<br>
<p>
I suppose if we're going to get machines to look after us and drop the *<br>
necessity* of work, the Culture's as good a vision of that as you could<br>
hope for.  But Banks is always wrestling with the inherent boringness of<br>
such a situation.<br>
