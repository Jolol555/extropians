<i>&gt; I do not want to be unknown person posting messages!</i><br>
<i>&gt; Let us know who we are!</i><br>
<p>
	Have you looked in your wallet lately?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We probably do not know each other; that does not help us.</i><br>
<p>
	Probably doesn't hurt either, does it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Tell me who you are; I want to know you.</i><br>
<p>
	Would you believe we lost our wallet?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Let us know what you think should be done, what need be done.</i><br>
<p>
	We INDIVIDUALISTS must UNITE.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What are your problems?.</i><br>
<p>
	Not having enough time to list all our problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Tell me what you want;</i><br>
<p>
	The whole world to go metric, including time, and the universal use of the<br>
Korean alphabet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; if I were your slave for life what would I do?</i><br>
<p>
	Bend over, we'll think about it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Help me help you.</i><br>
<p>
	If we can't help ourselves, how can we help you to help us?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Let us get organized</i><br>
<p>
	Wasn't this the most-spoken line by Jonathan Winters in "It's a Mad, Mad,<br>
Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; to do more than talk, to control our lives. Let us work together and</i><br>
cooperate.<br>
<p>
	Whose lives are out of "control"?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;  What are we doing?</i><br>
<p>
	Writing a lot of questions...it appears.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I learn and teach; I want to learn what you want me to teach you.</i><br>
<p>
	We want you to learn to teach us how to in-line skate down the Matterhorn.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What can we do?</i><br>
<p>
	We would suggest some good protective gear as a starter.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can be filled with doubt and not be able to answer this question, </i><br>
<i>&gt; though there is no thing I can not do if I try hard enough.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What can we not do?</i><br>
<p>
	Right off, you may have trouble stretching your upper lip over the top of<br>
your head while singing the Star-speckled Banana at a State Dinner in the<br>
White House.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can not be immortal yet and it makes me sad, afraid, and angry.</i><br>
<p>
	A single thought has the power to make you sad, afraid, and angry?<br>
	Perhaps you are already immortal. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Let us learn how we could do it, then do it. We need a plan; if you</i><br>
listen to me I will give you one. Follow me,  you will be led; Sit on your<br>
ass, you will be dead.<br>
You choose and you choose now! If I get one person motivated and bring<br>
their brain to life  we will be one step closer to our goals.<br>
<p>
	Why would anyone need a leader, especially one who is held emotional<br>
hostage to their thoughts?<br>
<p>
WAKE up! We are DYING! Our DNA is being TORN APART by free radicals! <br>
<p>
		Is it possible to jail those damn radicals?<br>
<p>
Bacteria, virus, and fungus are DEVOURING our cells! <br>
<p>
	Bacteria is also helping us to stay alive.  We eat fungus too, so it is a<br>
life-lives-off-life world.  So what is new?<br>
<p>
We are eating TOXINS!<br>
<p>
	Check out the natural toxins in potato peels.  Aren't you glad your body<br>
knows how to identify, seperate, and discharge toxins?  Of course that<br>
means you have to keep intoxicating yourself if you want to get drunk<br>
again.  Not too cost effective.<br>
<p>
People are STARVING! People are KILLING each other and themselves! Natural<br>
DISASTER is known world-wide! <br>
<p>
	How many humans die each day?  100,000?  200,000?  More?<br>
<p>
How much time is wasted? ...too much;  stop playing games and get serious;<br>
this is our life we are talking about!<br>
<p>
	All of life is a game.   There IS a cure for seriousness. :-)  Join our<br>
Playshop.<br>
