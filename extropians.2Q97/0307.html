You're probably right that a simpler non-crypto honor-system first<br>
implementation would help prove the idea and find new bugs.  Here's<br>
a specific proposal that I could implement in a few weeks, given<br>
the cooperation of the server owners:<br>
<p>
The existing lists stay as they are.  A new list, say "exi-paid" or<br>
something like that, is created.  Everything posted to the new list,<br>
paid or otherwise, is copied to the old list so the existing archive<br>
becomes the complete open archive.  Some people may still want to<br>
subscribe to that, or else just occasionally read it on the Web to<br>
find things to spend their tokens on.<br>
<p>
Tokens are simply 5- or 6-digit numbers (depending on traffic).  To<br>
pay for a posting, the number is placed in the text of the message<br>
in square brackets: [73567] anywhere in the post.  Shouldn't be a<br>
problem for anyone with any mailer to do that.<br>
<p>
The robot that recieves postings to exi-paid looks for the token,<br>
matches it against its list of outstanding tokens, replaces the text<br>
with [PAID] or something, removes that token from the outstanding<br>
list, and forwards it to the archive and to the paid list.<br>
<p>
A robot running daily or as a cron job on lucifer walks through the<br>
subscriber list, and at each name tosses the dice to decide whether<br>
to send that person a token (the probability is adjusted at will to<br>
control traffic).  If it decides to send one, it generates a random<br>
token different from any outstanding one, and then sends mail to the<br>
person selected that looks something like:<br>
<p>
    You have been issued the token [54637] for the discussion list<br>
    exi-paid@extropians.org.  If you wish to post to that list,<br>
    just include this number (along with the brackets) in some line<br>
    of your post.  It can only be sent once, and will be retired<br>
    when it is used.  If you want to give this token to someone<br>
    else, just forward them this message or tell them the number.<br>
    If you want this token to be reissued randomly, reply to this<br>
    message and change the subject line to the word "REISSUE".<br>
    See (some URL) for further details.<br>
<p>
Note that even non-members can post if they get a token from<br>
someone.  Those who are broke can post to the unpaid list a message<br>
with a title beginning with "BEG: &lt;subject&gt;", trying to convince<br>
others to fund them.<br>
<p>
The token mint logs every issuance and every redemption, and maybe<br>
produces statistics we can use to tune the process.  We may want to<br>
expire very old ones, and perhaps notify people who were issued them<br>
before we do. <br>
<p>

&gt; I like this idea.  It is worth trying; the main problem is getting
&gt; someone to implement it.  So one should strive for a plausible
&gt; *simple* design.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think the quoting issue is a big problem; authors who don't
&gt; quote enough won't be understood, and authors don't like that.
&gt; Similarly while a per page or line charge might be best, a per post
&gt; charge seems workable and much simpler; overly long posts will not get
&gt; read.
&gt; 
&gt; A non crypto first implementation also seems fine.  Just go down the
&gt; subscriber list at some rate sending out random ASCII strings of
&gt; length 30, which people can forward to whomever they like.  The big
&gt; problem is not people stealing tokens from peeking at messages; it is
&gt; people creating new addresses to get more tokens.  So I suggest tokens
&gt; only go to subscribers who have posted to the list within the last
&gt; month (or three months?), with the first post per such period being
&gt; free.
&gt; 
&gt; Having tokens expire after some period might be more robust to dealing
&gt; with unknown accumlations of tokens.  Then it would be fine to have a
&gt; target number of posts per week, and use a one or two week moving
&gt; average of the recent posting rate to adjust the rate of token
&gt; distribution.
&gt; 
&gt; The token for a new post should probably go in a special header line.
