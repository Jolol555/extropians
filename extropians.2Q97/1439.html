 From: Patrick Wilken &lt;patrickw@cs.monash.edu.au&gt;<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Therefore, the individual would be just as inclined to sacrifice himself</i><br>
as<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;anyone else.  Of course, an individual with access to these resources</i><br>
might<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;find himself gradually scrapping every part of him that was him before</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;assimilation because it is no longer useful.  Bring on the borgs!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Uggh! The Borg maybe interesting, but they certainly don't fit into my</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropian future. They seem alot more like old-fashioned communists</i><br>
dressed<br>
<i>&gt; up with techno bondage gear than any great leap forward into</i><br>
<i>&gt; anarcho-capitalism.</i><br>
<p>
Great leap forward?  Coincidence, or genuine perversity?  That phrase was<br>
used to describe the cultural revolution in China.<br>
<p>
Anyhow, the borg do sound somewhat communist because they are so integrated<br>
as to possibly make communism work.  I fully support anarcho-capatilism for<br>
the time being but I do not think that in a post human world of high<br>
bandwidth connections it will appear as it should appear now.  The concept<br>
of the individual could be drastically altered.  A "person" might do some<br>
things on their own and work together with others to accomplish a more<br>
difficult task.  In addition, the "person" could delegate a task to a<br>
smaller part of themselves much as we delegate most of the computations of<br>
learned skills such as typing or picking up a coffee mug to parts of the<br>
brain not involving conscious thought.  <br>
<p>
I truly do not know how scarce resources would be divided up in such an<br>
arrangement.  It might be possible to model the economy of a shifting<br>
individuality entity but I do not know where to begin.<br>
<p>
As for the borgs goals, they are rather pure.  In this harsh place we call<br>
the universe with its multitude of dangers anything that wants immortality<br>
must follow a simple commandment: replicate and mutate or die.  Replication<br>
can mean expansion as well as duplication.  In an ant colony when new<br>
workers are born replication has occurred but the colony has not<br>
duplicated, it has expanded.  The more spread out a system is, the better<br>
chance it has of surviving.  Humanity has a better chance of surviving than<br>
does any individual culture and a culture has a better chance of surviving<br>
than the individuals within it.  Mutate is a command to<br>
self-transformation.  The benefits to this are obvious.  It may also cause<br>
the elimination of the original form.  While this may not be good for one<br>
dimensional things like genes, people are four dimensional and can thus<br>
change and still be considered the same in some sense.  The borg certainly<br>
follow the replicate command.  It seems that some times they follow the<br>
mutate command but at others they seem stagnant. <br>
<p>
The problem with the individual replicating is that it tends to take up<br>
more space, thus forcing others out.  Granted with nanotechnology we can<br>
take up less space but this only slows down the problem.  If instead of<br>
displacing others they were absorbed we could solve this problem.  Ignoring<br>
the large problem of communication speeds, every former individual would be<br>
directing their efforts towards expanding against the limits of nature<br>
instead of expanding at the expense of other intelligences.  The speed of<br>
communication does impose some problems.  Those designs best able to<br>
spread, both against the limits of nature and against other intelligences,<br>
would become dominant.  It's the same scenario as a technosphere.  On a<br>
planet a dominant form could arise through the efforts of a small group and<br>
spread throughout the universe at the speed of light.  The entire planet<br>
could work together to bring about the dominant form.  A number of planets<br>
could work together.  At each stage more and more computing power becomes<br>
available at the cost of speed.  The most efficient balance could probably<br>
be modeled and if not it would be selected.<br>
