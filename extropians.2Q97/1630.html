<i>&gt; &gt; Why, after millions of years of evolution, we still age?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From the gene's point of view, the biological struggle between the</i><br>

<i>&gt;as far as the gene is concerned, goodbye Mom and Pop! Especially</i><br>
<i>&gt;if they're competing with young Boomer for foraging territory.</i><br>
<p>
That might explain why kids kill their parents (they do?), but doesn't seem<br>
to address JP's question.  After all, it takes Boomer somewhere between 12<br>
and 30 years to pop out Boomer Jr, but Mum and Dad are still in there<br>
replicating like fiends, once a year and sometimes twins.  If they stayed<br>
fertile, Myrtle, they'd always be ahead of the game.<br>
<p>
The real answers are going to involve complex interactions and costs.<br>
Beating the critters that feast inside humans is surely one key to this -<br>
sex as immunological remixing to stay Red Queened.  And childhood enhancers<br>
that just happen to involve deferred costs and luckless synergisms.  I've<br>
always assumed that since the germ line is passed straight down from the<br>
year dot, with mutations but no senescence, the DNA-cleanup equipment used<br>
to keep its shoes shined must be way too expensive to mass-produce for the<br>
grunts, even the smart guys in the CNS.<br>
<p>
Randolph Nesse and George Williams discuss this stuff in their recent book<br>
on darwinian medicine (EVOLUTION AND HEALING in the UK, something else in<br>
the USA), but wimp out at the crucial points - presumably because it's too<br>
soon to say anything really informed.<br>
