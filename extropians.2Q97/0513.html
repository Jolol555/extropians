<i>&gt; &gt;No man is an island.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's a reminder, a piece of advice, to each person.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's *not* a compusion to follow someone else's idea of service.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I wonder whether the author [Bartlett's fails me] would approve</i><br>
<i>&gt; your use of that line.</i><br>
<p>
The author was John Donne, the Elizabethan poet, although I think he<br>
wrote it as "No man is an Iland", but spelling was not nearly as<br>
conventionalized back then.<br>
<p>
Lord knows what he would have approved of. He was a rake as a young<br>
man, and began his career as a poet writing what I can only describe<br>
as offbeat love poetry. Later in life he became profoundly religious<br>
and abandoned the work of his early life. I have never found much<br>
evidence on his political views, or if he even had any. I'd guess he<br>
was a squishy collectivist, but there is no way to really know.<br>
<p>
BTW, "No man is an island" comes from the same text that contains the<br>
words "Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee".<br>
