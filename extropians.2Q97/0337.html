On Thursday, April 10, 1997, I suggested:<br>
When dealing with human health, moods and cognitive capacities, we are <br>
dealing with a VERY complex system that does not submit to simple <br>
mechanical measurements.<br>
<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker responded:<br>
&lt;So complexity tells you that you should just give up?  Nonsense.  I <br>
do not concede for one moment that there exists anything I am not <br>
capable of measuring, testing, and understanding /eventually/.  It may <br>
be very difficult; we may not even know how to begin going about it <br>
yet.  But anything we experience is measurable, without exception, if <br>
we take sufficient care in the experiment.  Even if our experiments <br>
are sloppy and our conclusions vague, we're still better off than <br>
someone who doesn't even try.&gt;<br>
<p>
I said nothing about giving up.  I said /simple mechanical <br>
measurements/ were not very useful.  Lee described experiments he <br>
performed to test the efficacy of melatonin and aspirin.  The aspirin <br>
vs. acetaminophen experiment, in particular, seems similar to what I <br>
would do when trying to evaluate some new supplement or nootropic <br>
substance.<br>
<p>
I think the following is relevant to the types of measurement problems <br>
I had in mind:<br>
&lt;It is important to emphasize this epistemic necessity of the <br>
complementarity of laws and measurements since it is often ignored. <br>
Reductionists try to avoid the epistemic cut and take an entirely <br>
objective, unified, or reified view of information as if it exists in <br>
the structures of the physical world independent of an organism or <br>
observer. Such a view is possible only because formal or structural <br>
information measures can, in fact, be applied to any physical <br>
structure without regard to its epistemic function in construction, <br>
measurement, prediction, or control. That is, structural information <br>
measures need have no relation to fitness, function, or meaning. This <br>
gratuitous use of structural information measures, while it may be <br>
made formally consistent with physical theory, simply has no <br>
significance for the naturally selected semantic information in <br>
biological systems and for predictive information used in control <br>
systems. &gt;<br>
<p>
The above is from a paper by Professor Howard Pattee called "The <br>
Physics of Symbols and the Evolution of Semiotic Controls" that was <br>
presented to a Workshop on Control Mechanisms for Complex Systems at <br>
the Santa Fe Institute last December.  It can be accessed at<br>
<a href="http://ssie.binghamton.edu/people/pattee_docs/semiotic.html">http://ssie.binghamton.edu/people/pattee_docs/semiotic.html</a><br>
<p>
The abstract of Pattee's paper is also worth quoting:<br>
&lt;Physical laws and semiotic controls require disjoint, complementary <br>
modes of conceptualization and description. Laws are global and <br>
inexorable. Controls are local and conditional. Life originated with <br>
semiotic controls. Semiotic controls require measurement, memory, and <br>
selection, none of which are functionally describable by physical laws <br>
that, unlike semiotic systems, are based on energy, time, and rates of <br>
change. However, they are structurally describable in the language of <br>
physics in terms of nonintegrable constraints, energy degenerate <br>
states, temporal incoherence, and irreversible dissipative events. A <br>
fundamental issue in physics, biology, and cognitive science is where <br>
to draw the necessary epistemic cut between the coherent physical <br>
dynamics and its rate-independent semiotic description.&gt;<br>

P.S. For those interested in the subject of Artificial Life, there is <br>
another excellent paper at the SUNY Binghamton server by Luis Rocha <br>
called "Evolutionary Systems and Artificial Life"<br>
