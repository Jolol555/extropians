This is quite possible, but we don't really know it takes that long,<br>
and new high tech might help speed things up.<br>

<i>&gt;running on SuperHexium or CAM-arrays can be even more easily modified,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or could be evolved at some speed.  </i><br>
<p>
Possibly.  But this sounds a lot<br>
like wishful thinking.<br>

I doubt if we've tried anywhere near as hard to domesticate smart primates<br>
as we've spent on A.I. research. <br>

<i>&gt;If you want to talk about "domesticated primates" and the various</i><br>

<i>&gt;(Unless, that is, we take up Tony Csoka's excellent suggestion and</i><br>

<p>
By "domestication" I meant getting the primates to understand and keep<br>
the peace, so we needn't fear their presense.  To trade instead of<br>
steal, etc.  I would very much want them to not be slaves, but to have<br>
their own spaces, property, etc.<br>
