<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm not sure why you think people's preferences regarding nudity would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt; be very different in the comon areas of a gated private development,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;... common areas are extremely restrictive, largely to prevent residents</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;from disturbing each other's quiet enjoyment of their homes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A park, on the other hand, is not directly near someone's home.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nudity is noisy then?</i><br>
<p>
No, it isn't, but many people attempt (irrationally) to keep their<br>
children away from nude people for whatever reason. ("Quiet Enjoyment"<br>
is a legal term of art -- it doesn't imply sound.)<br>
<p>
For what its worth, though, there is no rule in the cooperative<br>
apartment complex I live in against being nude in any of the common<br>
areas. I don't think the question has ever come up, frankly. If it<br>
did, this being New York, the likely answer would be fairly liberal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The question is whether recent historical trends are a one-time</i><br>
<i>&gt; historical transition, or whether it is more a matter of cycles,</i><br>
<i>&gt; multiple equilibria, and other contextual effects.  Maybe both the very</i><br>
<i>&gt; prudish and the routinely nude cultures are self-consistent equilibria</i><br>
<i>&gt; in certain contexts.  But most of human history has been between these</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremes, and so absent a reason to expect some fundamentally new</i><br>
<i>&gt; development, I'd expect future culture to also lie within historical</i><br>
<i>&gt; ranges.</i><br>
<p>
Note that historical ranges include primitive cultures which are, for<br>
our purposes, nudists, although they wouldn't think of themselves as<br>
such.<br>
<p>
I'm also not very sure about the "cycles" notion. European and North<br>
American body modesty mores have pretty much remained on the "prudish"<br>
side of the line from the fall of Rome until the last century. Thats a<br>
very long cycle indeed! I suspect that the primacy of Christianity had<br>
more to do with it than "natural cycles".<br>

<i>&gt; We can also consider the motivations of someone who provides a free park.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, in my "park" examples I was *not* assuming a free park --<br>
merely one which is open to the public, just as all McDonalds<br>
restaurants are open to members of the general public. That doesn't<br>
mean that they are free -- just that one needn't make special<br>
arrangements to use them.<br>
<p>
[As an aside, in case libertopia were to hit next week, it is my expectation<br>
that a not-for-profit organization like the Central Park Conservancy<br>
would control and maintain New York's Central Park (in my opinion, an<br>
excellent example of an urban park), rather than a private<br>
corporation. My suspicion is that a wide variety of ownership models<br>
would show up for parks and similar spaces -- for profit, membership<br>
based, non-profit with usage fees, non-profit without usage fees, "PR"<br>
based free parks paid for by companies, etc.]<br>

<i>&gt; I'm the originator of this line, and I'd like to say, one major reason I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think the world will go nude is due to the fact that almost all the current</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons people wear clothing is due to religious beliefs, or just plain being</i><br>
<i>&gt; accustomed to it.  Once the "average" person has eliminated mysticisms, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be expected in a highly advanced society of the future, the very reason</i><br>
<i>&gt; people wear clothes will be gone.</i><br>
<p>
I disagree, for a number of reasons.<br>
<p>
1) You dismiss too casually the need for clothing as a protection<br>
   against the elements. The need is very real, as someone living in a<br>
   city where the temperatures in winter get far below the freezing<br>
   point of water for months on end can attest.<br>
2) You also ignore the need for clothing as a way of protecting<br>
   against things like filthy work environments or subways or other<br>
   places where one probably doesn't want bare skin contacting all<br>
   manner of things.<br>
3) Clothing also serves many other functions. As someone who was<br>
   quasi-married to a fashion designer for many years, I can<br>
   personally attest that much of the work that goes into clothing has<br>
   nothing to do with purely utilitarian concerns but rather is<br>
   concerned with artistry, display (both of taste and of wealth),<br>
   social signals (what one wears is one of one's most important<br>
   social signaling mechanisms, btw), and a variety of similar<br>
   concerns that have nothing to do with concerns like 1 and 2. This<br>
   should not be surprising -- were it not the case, all people would<br>
   wear something like hyperfunctional jumpsuits or overalls at all<br>
   times.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I just think that one comes to a mental point of realizing that at</i><br>
<i>&gt; times, there is no need for clothes, and thus, a "rational" person</i><br>
<i>&gt; would choose to save his/her/its resources, not wear something</i><br>
<i>&gt; unneccessarily, and have no hangups about his physical body, which at</i><br>
<i>&gt; some point in time will itself be considered "clothing" to the mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; (after uploading, or at least once we have sufficient data transfer</i><br>
<i>&gt; techniques to change bodies).</i><br>
<p>
Note that your model of a purely rational person has no "good reason"<br>
to want a persian carpet, or a fine painting on their wall -- and yet<br>
many people do want these sorts of things. Not all rational desires<br>
may be explained in purely functional terms.<br>
