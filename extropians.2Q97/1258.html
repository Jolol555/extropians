<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; From: Max More &lt;maxmore@primenet.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A few of us in So Cal have been meeting to discuss investments. I am very</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; interested in helping the development and communication of investment</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; wisdom among Extropians. You know the expression: "If you're so smart, how</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; come you're not rich?" We should all have a compelling answer... "Just take</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a look at my portfolio, buddy!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Here are my thoughts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1) The markets are not perfectly efficient -- perfect efficiency</i><br>
<i>&gt;   requires perfect information transfer. The fact that markets are</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ever shifting, products ever changing, information always taking</i><br>
<i>&gt;   time to diffuse, means they can never be perfectly</i><br>
<i>&gt;   efficient. However, the markets are pretty damn close to efficient</i><br>
<i>&gt;   these days -- efficient enough that things like day trading are a</i><br>
<i>&gt;   risky way to make a living.</i><br>
<p>
The markets are far from perfect.  There are many wildly over-valued<br>
companies (some over-valued for reasons I can't possibly fathom) and many<br>
undervalued companies as well.  Also, the values of all securities are<br>
based on the expected *future* value and earnings, not the current book value.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2) It is possible to exploit market inefficiencies to make money. I've</i><br>
<i>&gt;   seen people who are just too far out of the statistical spectrum to</i><br>
<i>&gt;   be accidents -- traders like Paul Tudor Jones and Louis</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Bacon. These people are, however, unusual. I've seen far, far more</i><br>
<i>&gt;   people who can't manage to trade their way out of a paper</i><br>
<i>&gt;   bag.</i><br>
<p>
The keys to making money on the market are sufficient education on how the<br>
market really works, and doing enough research to make informed decisions.<br>
"Buy low, sell high" is not enough knowledge to make money on the market.<br>
You have to be able to tell when "high" is really high and "low" is really<br>
low.  The vast majority of people who trade do not know enough information<br>
to make trading a "guaranteed" thing.  And listening to your stock broker<br>
is almost always a surefire way to *not* make much money.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;3) The people who are guaranteed a place at the banquet are the casino</i><br>
<i>&gt;   owners. Brokers always get their vig. Traders -- especially</i><br>
<i>&gt;   amateurs -- don't always do so well. In the futures market, friends</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of mine at Refco tell me the average time between opening a futures</i><br>
<i>&gt;   trading account and losing *ALL* your stake is about a year.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Futures are a very dangerous market to trade; futures are even dangerous to<br>
seasoned experts.  Futures is one of the few markets I will not trade in.<br>
Amateurs trading futures are foolhardy.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;4) The people who do manage to make money "trading" rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "investing" are almost inevitably full time professionals who are</i><br>
<i>&gt;   very, very smart -- and even they sometimes "blow up". The author</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of the famous "Memoirs of a Stock Operator", Larry Livingston,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   killed himself a few years after writing his book after losing</i><br>
<i>&gt;   every penny he had.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
There are many successful part-time traders.  At every brokerage there are<br>
one or two clients who average 100% return every year, a small group of<br>
clients who average 50% every year, and a very large number who average 10%<br>
a year.  To lose everything requires holding risky positions in a<br>
non-diverse portfolio.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;On the other hand....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1) Over the long term, the stock market DOES outperform almost all</i><br>
<i>&gt;   other investments -- and outperforms it handsomely.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2) You don't even have to think much to make money in the markets:</i><br>
<i>&gt;   passive investments like buying into an S&amp;P 500 following mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt;   fund do bring their investors excellent returns.</i><br>
<p>
Safe and profitable, but not aggressively profitable.  It will take decades<br>
to grow a sizeable sum, especially if you are starting small.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;3) Even random portfolios of sufficient size do pretty well in</i><br>
<i>&gt;   general.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Random portfolios are stupid.  You might as well invest in a mutual fund,<br>
which is probably safer.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;4) People who have a slight information edge -- like understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt;   what a high tech company does -- can sometimes get an advantage</i><br>
<i>&gt;   even if they aren't full time investors.</i><br>
<p>
Absolutely.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My advice is therefore simple.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you want to be rich, you have two options:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Option one: get a good job, save as much of your money has you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;bear to starting when you are young, and invest it in mutual funds or</i><br>
<i>&gt;in a diversified porfolio. If you wait long enough, the returns will</i><br>
<i>&gt;be good. The higher paying the job, the more you can afford to</i><br>
<i>&gt;save. Almost everyone can do this and be assured of living comfortably</i><br>
<i>&gt;if you have enough patience. No, it isn't glamorous, and it won't make</i><br>
<i>&gt;you "filthy rich". However, as the toroise and the hare found out,</i><br>
<i>&gt;slow and steady often wins. If you can save 20% or more of your income</i><br>
<i>&gt;and you invest all of it, in ten or twenty years you'll find yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a nice amount of cash.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Option two: start a high growth business. This is the most practical</i><br>
<i>&gt;way to become "filthy rich". It is, however, stressful and not for</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyone -- and not everyone has good ideas.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
This is also a good option.  As I am fond of telling people: "Statistically<br>
you are 1000 times more likely to become a millionaire working hard and<br>
starting a business than playing the California Lottery."   Yet a lot more<br>
people play the lottery than start a business or invest.<br>
<p>
So many people want it handed to them.<br>
<p>
I have a third option:<br>
<p>
Taking the time to do adequate research and to make informed decisions pays<br>
off handsomely.  I probably spend 20 hours per month doing research and<br>
educating myself on the market.  As a result, I have done very well over<br>
the years, and far better than the indices.  I am usually holding 6 to 8<br>
stock positions at any one time and have not had a negative month that I<br>
can remember.  To date this year I have averaged ~8% return every month.<br>
(Disclaimer: past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.)  Some<br>
years are better than others, but I consistently do far better than the<br>
market by making intelligent trades and not reacting to the fluctuations<br>
and fickleness of the market (especially the NASDAQ!).  I rarely hold a<br>
stock position more than a year and often no more than 6 months.<br>
<p>
For those with only small amounts of money to invest (say $50 per month), I<br>
would recommend investing in growth oriented mutual funds.  The brokerage<br>
houses penalize small trades heavily.  Trading stocks starts to become<br>
economical when you have enough money saved to start buying at least 40-50<br>
shares per trade.<br>
<p>
<p>
There is some risk involved, but there is no need to put such a grim spin<br>
on trading.  There are many people who make consistent profits as<br>
part-time, amateur traders.<br>
<p>
