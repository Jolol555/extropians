What, you expect claims of perfection in the population?  Those who<br>
aren't so working can't contradict you; those who are have no knowledge<br>
to speak of others, and apparently there isn't enough tribalism to call<br>
out a defense of "extropians".  The only way to refute you would be to<br>
do a thorough study of how many extropians were being extropic, and no<br>
one seems to care enough to do so.  Can't imagine why.  Maybe they're<br>
too busy being extropic to hold polls for the sake of arguing with you.<br>
At any rate, you won't get much challenge whether you're right or not.<br>

Well, it's not.  Or doesn't have to be.  Would I be faulted for not<br>
working to be a millionaire if doing so would interfere with my<br>
intellectual pursuits for the next two decades?  Admittedly a 100 grand<br>
stake would be nice, but at the moment I think I'm better off living on<br>
6-7 grand a year (so much for the poverty level) and figuring out what I<br>
want to do and what I might be able to get people to pay me to do.  And<br>
I am living on so little.  (I'm waiting for my credit limit to exceed my<br>
income.  That'll be amusing.  Not that I'd use it like that.)  Or if<br>
someone took a job they liked at half the salary of one they could hold,<br>
but wouldn't like, and which wouldn't let them retire that much faster,<br>
would they be insufficiently concerned with their financial well-being<br>
then?<br>
<p>
What anonymous specifically said about physical survival is even more<br>
problematic.  I'm rather ignorant of any strong evidence that vegan<br>
diets are good for health and long life-span.  I'm aware of evidence of<br>
what bad diets are, lots of saturated fat and no fiber, etc., which<br>
being vegan would avoid by default (unless done badly itself), and aware<br>
of evidence for calorie restricted diets increasing lifespan, at least<br>
in other mammals (is it true that mammals all have about a billion<br>
heartbeat max lifespans, except for humans at 2-4 billion?)  So I can<br>
well avoid bad diets while (at 21) letting other volunteers have fun<br>
debugging CR diets.<br>
<p>
And while I'm not physically reckless myself, I hardly see why it need<br>
be un-extropian do go skydiving, or whatever, carefully.  There is a<br>
legitimate quality of life question.  And early space exploration will<br>
no doubt be rather risky; will it be unextropian to be among the first<br>
space colonists?<br>

'Cause you're smart enough to try to avoid having a mid-life crisis in<br>
your (rich) middle-age, maybe.  I could make a lot of money being a<br>
60-hour/week programmer.  I could also possibly go nuts, or at least be<br>
highly frustrated at all the things I wouldn't be learning.  Being a<br>
6-hour a week web manager might be too far in the other direction... in<br>
the long run.  Or if I mismanaged my finances.  <br>
<p>
You and anonymous posted diatribes basically criticizing someone,<br>
somewhere, for doing something wrong.  No doubt someone was.  Probably<br>
someone was screwing up in the ways you were thinking of.  So what?  You<br>
expect the list to deny that anything's wrong anywhere?  You expect a<br>
whole series of individual defenses like this one?  Why?<br>
