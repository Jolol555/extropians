Steve Witham graded my response with:<br>

<i>&gt;  I think Franklin VanArdoy gets a B.  Extra points for saying it's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  schizophrenia test, but then points off for saying "You don't want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  pass it."  How mundane!  What is this world coming to!?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
In my own defense, I would like to emphasize the passing of the test over the<br>
test itself.  <br>
For anyone who has spent time in a county or state psychiatric facility under<br>
court order or threat thereof, no explanation is necessary.  It is for those<br>
who have not *yet* encountered this barbarism that I defend my statement.<br>
Different states have different labels for the incarceration without trial of<br>
persons to be held in psychiatric facilities.  In Arizona, where I worked in<br>
such a facility, a court ordered psychiatric evaluation is called a Title 36,<br>
which is often "upgraded" to a Chapter 36 Psychiatric Treatment.  The latter<br>
is the equivalent of imprisonment--should the C-36 patient refuse treatment,<br>
ie refuse to be medicated, he will be physically restrained and injected with<br>
an assortment of psychotropic chemicals until he submits.  The former is<br>
typical of the Catch 22s found in our legal system.  Any patient under a T-36<br>
may refuse treatment, but his refusal is documented and presented before the<br>
court in the C-36 hearings.  You see, a sane individual would never refuse<br>
treatment.<br>
We had a lawyer who was court ordered for a T-36 last summer.  He came in<br>
speaking about covert CIA operations to which he was privy.  He also claimed<br>
that he had a Mercedes Benz 600 with an AMG engine, specific modifications,<br>
etc.  In the privacy of the nurse's station several of the nurses would laugh<br>
at the gentleman when he would talk about the CIA activities abroad.  That<br>
was until one day when an LPN documented the subject matter of her dialogue<br>
with him and joked about the latest dilusions to come from this<br>
schizophrenic.  Fortunately for our abused lawyer I was familiar with every<br>
one of the incidents he had just cited, and gave additional information on<br>
each.  Unfortunately for him I was not invited to testify at the C-36<br>
hearings.<br>
And I take no pleasure in admitting that I myself have been on both sides of<br>
this punishment.<br>
So perhaps passing a test for schizophrenia isn't so desirable after all.<br>
By the way, after the lawyer was released, with a court order to return daily<br>
for continued medication, he drove past me while I was pedaling back to<br>
campus.  His Mercedes Benz 600 sped passed me in what seemed like a 0-40mph<br>
acceleration in about 3 seconds.  ;-)<br>
