Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt;Minority interests are always protected better by a free market</i><br>
<i>&gt;than by any consensus-based system.</i><br>
<p>
While I appreciate Lee's fuller explaination his point, this statement <br>
has not been definitively proven and remains a point of questioning <br>
and debate among libertarians and groups that use consensus <br>
processes.  The point has been raised in detail on many political <br>
discussions on this list, so I will not attempt to elaborate further.<br>
<p>
Regarding consensus, most of my facilitation training has focused on <br>
this type of process, as I worked with nonprofit groups.  Consensus <br>
processes were developed for the very purpose of accomodating highly <br>
heterogeneous group meetings, which experience severe slowdowns due <br>
to the wide variety of viewpoints represented.  These processes have the <br>
advantage of allowing heterogenous groups to make decisions quickly on <br>
areas of general agreement and concentrate their time on the issues that <br>
need more debate.  Concensus also provides an excellent system for <br>
registering lone objections, which can prevent defections or one of <br>
those blowups that can shut down a meeting.<br>
