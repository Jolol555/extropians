I'm involved with organising the first conference of the Association for<br>
the Scientific Study of Consciousness. The date for early registrations is<br>
fast approaching on May 1st. So if you are interested in attending please<br>
register soon. The date for submission of spoken presentations has now<br>
past, but we are happy to consider poster presentations up until the 1st of<br>
June.<br>

      THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS<br>
             WILL PRESENT A CONFERENCE AROUND THE THEME OF:<br>
<p>
       WHAT DOES IMPLICIT COGNITION TELL US ABOUT CONSCIOUSNESS?<br>
<p>

                 JUNE 13-16, 1997: CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA<br>
<p>
<p>
The first conference of the Association for the Scientific Study of<br>
Consciousness will be held at the Claremont Colleges, about an hour's<br>
drive from Los Angeles, over four days between the 13th and 16th of<br>
June, 1997. The organizing committee for the conference consists of:<br>

THEME<br>
=====<br>
<p>
The phenomena of implicit cognition -- implicit memory, implicit<br>
learning, unconscious perception, blindsight, and so on -- have<br>
attracted widespread attention in recent years.  This is partly because<br>
of their intrinsic interest, and partly because the study of these<br>
processes holds great promise as an empirical method for investigating<br>
consciousness.  But although research in these areas has proliferated,<br>
the connections between this research and issues about consciousness<br>
have not yet been fully articulated.  What have we learned about the<br>
conscious mind from the study of implicit cognition?<br>
<p>
This conference is intended to address this question, drawing<br>
systematic connections between implicit cognition and consciousness. We<br>
welcome both empirical contributions, using experimental research to<br>
help understand the nature of conscious and unconscious processes, and<br>
theoretical contributions that analyze or integrate existing work.<br>
