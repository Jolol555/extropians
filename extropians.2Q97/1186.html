         SEPANG, Malaysia, May 17 (Reuter) - Standing on a hill  <br>
surrounded by rubber and oil palm plantations, Malaysian Prime <br>
Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Saturday launched what is being <br>
touted as the world's first planned intelligent city. <br>
         Using a ``smart card,'' Mahathir sent an instruction via  <br>
computer to an object resembling a space probe on the hill which <br>
then drilled a hole in the ground, launching Cyberjaya <br>
(''cyber-success'' in Malay). <br>
         Aimed at luring top high-technology firms, the 7,000-hectare  <br>
(17,300-acre) city will eventually support a population of <br>
240,000. Every home will have access to the Internet and all <br>
transactions will be done with smart cards. <br>
         The development, which Mahathir likes to call ``Cybercity,''  <br>
is located in the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), a zone 15 km <br>
by 50 km (nine miles by 30 miles) stretching south from Kuala <br>
Lumpur to where a new international airport and a new federal <br>
capital called Putrajaya are also under construction. <br>
         ``The establishment of the MSC, and Cyberjaya in particular,  <br>
will enable Malaysians to leapfrog into the Information Age,'' <br>
Mahathir said in a speech at the ground-breaking. <br>
         He said it was the world's first effort at creating a  <br>
planned living and working area for the information age. <br>
         It would be a place ``where knowledge workers and other  <br>
residents may interact freely in a relaxed social environment, <br>
thereby creating an environment conducive to promoting <br>
creativity and innovation, similar to that which prevails in <br>
Silicon Valley in the United States,'' Mahathir said. <br>
         Some 40 foreign and local firms have made commitments to  <br>
locate in Cyberjaya, including U.S. companies AT&amp;T Corp, Intel <br>
Corp, Sun Microsystems Inc and NCR Corp, Germany's Siemens AG, <br>
British Telecommunications Plc and Japanese firms Mitsubishi <br>
Corp, Sumitomo and Sharp. <br>
         Mahathir described the response to the MSC as  <br>
``overwhelming.'' The government expects 200 companies will <br>
eventually settle in the corridor, but Mahathir said that target <br>
would likely be exceeded. <br>
         A joint venture between five Malaysian parties and Japan's  <br>
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Corp will develop <br>
Cyberjaya. The initial investment is estimated at 3.5 billion <br>
ringgit ($1.4 billion). <br>
         The first phase of 2,800 hectares (6,900 acres) is to be  <br>
completed by next April, including Multimedia University. <br>
         First conceived in 1994, the corridor hopes to attract a  <br>
variety of firms -- from software designers and electronic <br>
publishers to film production houses and Internet service <br>
providers. <br>
         Some of the flagship applications include smart schools that  <br>
incorporate the Internet and other computer applications as well <br>
as telemedicine. The latter enables doctors to communicate by <br>
satellite. <br>
         Its electronic backbone will be a 2.5-10 gigabyte digital  <br>
fibre-optic network that will link the corridor to Japan, Europe <br>
and the United States. <br>
         The MSC will initially be driven by three mega-projects that  <br>
will be major consumers of multimedia products and services. <br>
         One is the new capital of Putrajaya, designed to be the  <br>
world's first paperless government hub. <br>
         The others are the new airport and the Kuala Lumpur City  <br>
Centre, a massive office project featuring the Petronas Twin <br>
Towers, the world's tallest buildings at 452 metres (1,482 <br>
feet). <br>
         ($1- 2.5 ringgit)  <br>
