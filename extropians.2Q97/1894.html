Over all I find it hard to imagine a futere where income inqualities<br>
are not much greater than they are now.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Varing the IQ variance for a fixed lifespan, is there some maximum IQ</i><br>

<i>&gt;longer lifespans are required to take advantage of it?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't think IQ differences above a certain level are meaningful </i><br>
<p>
If this is true it has great implications for AI and for human<br>
enhancement. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Again I think the compound interest analogy is good with very high IQs</i><br>
<i>&gt;adding small percentages which take a long time to become significant.</i><br>
<p>
This also sounds like a declining marginal value of intelligence.<br>
