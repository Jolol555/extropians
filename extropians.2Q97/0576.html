The mailing list for Julian May's Galactic Milieu did something like<br>
this.  We wanted to coalesce the common discussions and the usual<br>
arguments over them.  One volunteer did the basic structure and made up<br>
a list of questions and argument topics.<br>
<p>
The writing of answers was done by whoever cared about that topic to put<br>
forward summaries of their arguments and sometimes summaries of opposing<br>
arguments as well.  For example, I picked up "Who is Fury?" among other<br>
questions, and had the fun of presenting my beliefs as well as the range<br>
of common other beliefs.  The organizer then collected the summaries and<br>
stuck them back into her structure.  Voila, super-FAQ, and very little<br>
to talk about afterwards.  Much more useful than an archive.<br>
<p>
Who did what sections, or even paragraphs, is clearly labeled at each <br>
place.  Instant local immortality for anyone who worked on the FAQ.<br>
Forevermore anyone who looks up certain questions will see my name and<br>
the wisdom and fairness of my summaries. :)<br>
<p>
So we could try something like that.<br>

sci.crypt's cryptography FAQ is fairly neat; I don't know how it was<br>
made.<br>

And even priests were coming to spend some time in it, because of the<br>
collection of religious books.  There were one thousand, two hundred and<br>
eighty-three religious books in there now, each one--according to<br>
itself--the only one any man need ever read.  It was sort of nice to see<br>
them all together. -- Terry Pratchett, _Small Gods_<br>
