John K Clark:<br>
<i>&gt;Max Planck started the entire revolution by proposing that energy is</i><br>
<i>&gt;NOT continuous, everything followed from there. Take a beam of light</i><br>
<i>&gt;for example, it has momentum nhf, h is the Planck constant, f is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;frequency of the light, and n is an INTEGER, the number of photons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Digital.</i><br>
<p>
Me:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The formula is correct, but your conclusion is not.  While n is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;integer, f is not.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If some physical property comes in units, 1c, 2c, 3c, 4c, ... then that</i><br>
<i>&gt;property (in this case momentum) is digital, the constant c can be pi, e,</i><br>
<i>&gt;or any real number except zero, it does not matter. The absolute value</i><br>
<i>&gt;of one unit is not important, the point is that the difference between</i><br>
<i>&gt;one unit and the next comes in steps, integers. Digital.</i><br>
<p>
That is the whole point, the quantities we are talking about are not<br>
observed in multiples of some invariant "unit".  Take muon decay as<br>
an example.  To the best of our knowledge, muon is an elementary<br>
particle.  It decays into an electron and two neutrinos.  If what you<br>
are saying were true, momentum of the electron in the rest frame of<br>
the parent muon would be quantized, meaning it could only have values<br>
from a discrete set, and the spacing between the possible values would<br>
be some constant.  This is not observed.  Electrons from muon decays<br>
have a continuous momentum spectrum, and the probability distribution<br>
of that spectrum can be calculated with little sweat.<br>
<p>
Mass is equivalent to energy, and also doesn't come in discreete<br>
steps.  It was fashionable in the middle of this century to split<br>
mass eigenstates by their intrinsic width into "particles" and<br>
"resonances", but in fact there is no logical difference between<br>
the two.  What I'm saying is, every particle that decays has a<br>
fuzzy mass.  The exact amount of fuzziness depends on how quickly<br>
it decays.  For example, a rho is sort of an excited pion, and its<br>
intrinsic width is about ten percent of its mass.  It decays into<br>
two pions most of the time.  There is nothing discrete about its<br>
mass.  You can observe a rho at 770 MeV as easily as at 770 plus<br>
pi MeV.  Both particles are equally real.<br>
<p>
It is certainly true that some observable quantities, like spin, have<br>
discrete (you prefer "digital") spectra, but energy/momentum/mass do<br>
not.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you want to find the momentum of an individual photon, hf, you</i><br>
<i>&gt;can find it by using the formula hN/X , h is the Planck constant</i><br>
<i>&gt;again, and N is the number of wave crests the photon makes over a</i><br>
<i>&gt;distance X. Digital.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Another wrong conclusion.  One: N is not an integer.  A photon that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;has one "crest" over one meter has one point three crests over one</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;point three meters.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1.3 crests? Is that anything like 1.3 pregnancies? As I said, as you</i><br>
<i>&gt;get to the end of distance X there will always be uncertainty over</i><br>
<i>&gt;whether something is a crest or not, but the uncertainty can be made</i><br>
<i>&gt;arbitrary small simply by making X larger because that increases the</i><br>
<i>&gt;number of crests you are certain about and leaves the number you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;uncertain of unchanged. Now you have better knowledge about what the</i><br>
<i>&gt;momentum is, but because X is now larger you have less knowledge about</i><br>
<i>&gt;where the photon is.</i><br>
<p>
No, you cannot count crests of a single photon.  By "counting" a single<br>
crest you are destroying the photon.  This particular fact is the gist<br>
of the Heisenberg inequality and its most "intuitive" explanation:<br>
"counting" a crest of a photon means measuring its electromagnetic<br>
field, but the photon itself _is_ electromagnetic field, so you are<br>
in fact having it interact with something and therefore destroying<br>
your original photon.  You may still be left with a photon, but that<br>
won't be your original photon.  Counting crests is just a mental crutch.<br>
A gedankenexperiment if you will.<br>
<p>
Now, don't confuse this with interference.  Measuring interference is<br>
counting crests of an _ensemble_ of particles.  Yes, you can count<br>
one point three crests, for example by fitting a sine function instead<br>
of counting peaks.  And yes, adding another crest will improve your<br>
measurement by reducing the error.  This is not the same as counting<br>
crests of a single particle.  Interference is a beautiful quantum<br>
phenomenon in that it defies "intuition" in a maximal way.  Even if<br>
you send particles one by one through a contraption that makes them<br>
interfere, you will still see the interference pattern.  The only<br>
"intuitive" (i.e. classical) explanation is that single particles<br>
self-interfere, which is of course horse manure.  Quantum mechanics<br>
is simply not intuitive to a classically indoctrinated mind, as you<br>
aptly put it:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; True, but it's not randomness that makes Quantum Mechanics so weird,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's spooky action at a distance, retroactive causes, and the question</i><br>
<i>&gt; of exactly what an observer is and is not that makes it all so bazaar.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The crazy experiments that proved Bell's inequality is violated should</i><br>
<i>&gt; not have turned out the way they did, but they did.</i><br>
<p>
Again, don't forget that all these weirdnesses are problems of<br>
interpretation, not of quantum mechanics itself.  QM works.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Two: the number of crests depends on the frame of reference.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Everything depends of the frame of reference, except the speed of light.</i><br>
<i>&gt; All photons will be red shifted or blue shifted, the amount of the shift</i><br>
<i>&gt; will depends on how fast you're moving relative to the source, and at any</i><br>
<i>&gt; instant the shift will be a constant for all atoms of any element in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; source.</i><br>
<p>
True, and the shift is not discrete.  It is continuously variable,<br>
so in principle you can make any source emit on any (non-quantized)<br>
wavelength.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;in the Universe and in my  current profession c == h == 1.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One what?</i><br>
<p>
It doesn't matter.  The point is that c and h are more fundamental<br>
than meter or second.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;c and h do not come in the same units, but the units are related,</i><br>
<i>&gt;sure you could change the size of the units of c and make c whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt;you want, but then h would have to be fixed.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly, nail on the head.  It is the relationship between the two<br>
constants that is fundamental, not the value of the units we choose<br>
to express them in.  Or, as Jay Reynolds Freeman noticed:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;  Would it not be more accurate to say that one can select units</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;in which c == h == 1, and that the particular values they have in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;(say) the MKS system of units are historical accidents based on </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;the way that system was set up.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;  It would, of course, be possible to set up units in which c and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;h had other values -- say, pi -- in which case the case for what</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;some posters have referred to as a "digital universe" would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;even more far-fetched.</i><br>
