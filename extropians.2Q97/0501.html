You are speaking from theory.  In reality, I don't think anyone has yet<br>
shown that a society without compulsion can compete with other societies<br>
in the real world.  I am aware that there are some good ideas floating<br>
around about how to provide for common defense without military<br>
conscription, create an educated electorate and a healthy<br>
information-service-based economy without compulsory schooling, provide a<br>
stable money supply without a government monopoly on coinage, etc. But<br>
until they have been proven to work, it's silly to get indignant about it.<br>
<p>
Maybe you have a "right" to absolute freedom from the interference of<br>
others.  So what?  It's irrelevant if it's impractical.  It's childish<br>
to get upset because you don't have something that you can't have.<br>
Maybe we can build these Utopias, but only with a complete restructuring<br>
of our society and culture.  Just grabbing at "rights" willy-nilly will<br>
probably not do it.<br>
<p>
And it seems to me you should allow, in your broad formulation of rights,<br>
that people have the right to build communities as they see fit, including<br>
ones that use compulsion, as long as they allow people to leave those<br>
communities.  If there are no non-compulsory communities out there for you<br>
to go to, well, that's too bad, but maybe it's evolution in action.<br>
