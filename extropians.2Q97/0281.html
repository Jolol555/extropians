Oh no, not this claim again.  What wages do dogs get paid?  Cows?<br>
Chickens?  Computers?<br>

Humans are different, you say?  How?  They're sentient, yes.  Now assume<br>
a dairy cow has been made sentient.  What practical difference does that<br>
make to us?<br>
<p>
I suppose this debate depends on the definition of 'slave'.  Is a human<br>
enslaved if they serve your every wish willingly?<br>

Jeane L. Dixon, world renowned psychic, died Saturday (1/25) at age 79.<br>
There was almost universal sadness and lament throughout the world of<br>
celebrity psychics.  Contacted at her home, Dionne Warwick's spokeswoman<br>
said that "[Miss] Warwick is beside herself -- none of us expected this<br>
to happen."<br>
