Wrong. You can run your photon through a set of filters, each of which<br>
is 45 degrees turned relative to the previous filter. If the photon was<br>
originally at 45 degrees, it will always be blocked by the second filter<br>
in the series. What actually happens is that each filter takes out 50%<br>
of the incident photons, and the second filter therefore passes 25% of<br>
the photons, the third passes 12.5%, etc. The point is that quantum<br>
values are indeterminate, which means not fixed until measured!<br>

<p>
Sure, if the other photon hasn't interacted with something, which you<br>
can't know faster than light speed.<br>
