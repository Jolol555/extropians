<p>
1. The family have guns and he'll probably be shot.<br>
<p>
2. The claim would merely pass on to someone else, who'd take more care <br>
when collecting it.<br>
<p>
3. If the family think he's likely to try to kill them they'd simply sell <br>
the claim at a discount to someone who is better able to collect. This <br>
might become the normal order of business; sell the claim at 75% of face <br>
value to a collection agency who'd pursue it themselves. That way the <br>
family are guaranteed to get most of the money immediately.<br>
<p>
4. In a Friedman-like system he'd probably become an outlaw and anyone who <br>
wished could kill him without fear of legal reprisals.<br>
<p>
So there are good reasons to pay up.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; circumstantial?  I, personally, see that in some instances murder should not</i><br>

<p>
Murder is by definition a crime; homicide is another matter. <br>
<p>

<p>
First you'll have to define 'truth' and demonstrate that we even know what<br>
the 'truth' of an event is (see the traditional 'banana murder' psychology<br>
experiment; 'shoot' someone with a banana and most witnesses will see a<br>
gun instead). <br>
