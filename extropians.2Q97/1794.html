     "Rick Knight" writes regarding the transition from nomadic herding to <br>
     farming:<br>
<i>     &gt;  So history (or a cultural trend) should repeat itself?  No thanks. </i><br>
     <br>
     Robin then inquired:<br>
     <br>
     What do you mean here?  That you will personally not want to upload,<br>
     or that you will try to prevent this historic event by stopping others<br>
     of us from uploading?<br>
     <br>
     And I clarify:<br>
     <br>
     It was actually a tangent thought off the "uploading" thread.  I'd <br>
     welcome the ability to upload as I am ongoingly ravenous for <br>
     information but I didn't quite get the herding/farming analogy.  And <br>
     I'd never want to prevent others from doing what they want although <br>
     I'm not crazy about Hale-Bopp style suicide pacts, White Supremacy <br>
     movements and the like.<br>
     <br>
     The herding/farming transition definitely complicated life but it also <br>
     ushered in a period of mindless domination and proprietorship that is <br>
     all but taken for granted today.  It's a trigger issue for me (kind of <br>
     like abortion: I'm for it rights-wise but not comfortable with it <br>
     life-wise) since agriculture ultimately enabled the sciences and the <br>
     arts but at the expense of marching over the backs of the many who <br>
     were at first slaves, then serfs, now consumers &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
