I watched Star Trek: First Contact yesterday, and enjoyed it (despite<br>
the holes in the logic and technobabble - after all, it is Star<br>
Trek). The mood of the film was if not transhumanist at least<br>
humanist; one idea that was repeatedly stressed was the drive to<br>
better oneself - even the Borg claimed they were doing it. While the<br>
real story was about the fight against the Borg, the other plot<br>
(making sure the first warp ship was launched at the right time to<br>
bring about first contact) was fairly well presented and used every<br>
trick in the book to evoke enthusiasm in a sf lover like me.<br>
<p>
Anyway, as you might guess I cheered for the Borg during the film :-) <br>
And being a logical kind of person I was somewhat irritated by how<br>
they were treated since they are actually something rather unique: a<br>
truly alien kind of alien in a popular sf universe. <br>
<p>
Their problem is that they are almost too good enemies: if the Borg<br>
didn't make obvious mistakes and move slowly so they can easily be<br>
hit (together with saying "Resistance is futile" this forms the<br>
dreaded Dalek Syndrome) they would be practically invincible, which<br>
of course wouldn't go down well with the audience.<br>
<p>
This also explains the Borg Queen: imagine that the Collective just<br>
spoke through the nearest borg instead of through a seductive lady<br>
with slight alien queen tendencies; it would simply be too impersonal<br>
and nasty for most viewers to handle, even if it is more logical.<br>
<p>
Post hoc rationalizations are quite popular among trekkies, so here<br>
are some of transhumanist relevance:<br>
<p>
The idea of a Borg Queen was never explored fully. She explained her<br>
function as "I bring order into chaos". If we see the Collective as a<br>
MIMD supermind, this can actually make sense: ordinary borgs acts as<br>
normal processors, but the Queen acts as a higher order processor<br>
managing information flow and resolving conflicts. She doesn't rule,<br>
rather arbitrate; groups of borgs might develop plans and evaluate<br>
them, she makes a decision when there is a tie between different<br>
subsets. The movie appeared slightly inconsistent about her<br>
uniqueness; on one hand the main characters appeared to believe her<br>
to be unique, but she also laughed at the idea of her having been<br>
destroyed together with the Borg ship where Picard first encountered<br>
as "You humans think so three-dimensionally!". One possible<br>
explanation is that every Borg ship simply has one queen, they are<br>
instances (clones?) of an original queen and can be replaced if<br>
needed. True object re-use. <br>
<p>
The Borg Collective represents an extreme evolutionary strategy, that<br>
of turning all non-self into self. Note that they doesn't seem to<br>
change themselves much by assimilating others, which either suggests<br>
that they just overwrite originality with their standard template, or<br>
that the Collective is so large that adding another civilization<br>
doesn't change it much. If the Borg was a bit nicer about it and used<br>
guile, it could probably assimilate more effectively (but that would<br>
make them too subtle villains to be interesting in the series). <br>
<p>
Assimilation of others is an evolutionarily stable strategy: a small<br>
subgroup of mutant borgs that doesn't assimilate others will be<br>
assimilated themselves. So this might be one possible future track in<br>
the Convergence Hypothesis described by Nicholas Boström: once a<br>
substantial part of a civilization becomes borg-like, it will<br>
assimilate the rest and a Collective will result.<br>
<p>
The Borg are essentially a parasitic form of intelligence, using<br>
other intelligent life to provide raw materials, individuals and<br>
ideas. Their actual physical manifestation doesn't really matter, it<br>
is their basic memes and abilities that define them. Hans Moravec<br>
suggested in Mind Children that we should look out for "civilization<br>
parasites" among messages sent across interstellar space; there might<br>
be memes out there that use intelligent life to spread in more or<br>
less nasty ways. Turning them into Borgs is just one possibility<br>
(this is what the Blight did in AFUTD). In fact, they might be<br>
weapons: Linda Nagata suggests one such ultra-subtle weapon in<br>
_Deception Well_.<br>
<p>
An interesting question is if symbiotic forms of intelligence can<br>
exist. If there are enough "hosts", symbiotic intelligences might<br>
integrate themselves into the system and become indispensable. Just<br>
think of the tribbles of Star Trek, or the possibility of us humans<br>
becoming symbionts with our AI systems in order to survive the<br>
Singularity.<br>

Resistance is futile, you will be transcended.<br>
