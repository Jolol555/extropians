<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In an anarcho-capitalistic society, what else is there besides private</i><br>
<i>&gt; areas and "common areas of a private contractually based community"?</i><br>
<p>
Re-read what I wrote carefully.<br>
<p>
An anarchocapitalist society has two kinds of territory: unclaimed and<br>
private. Presumably most territory on the planet would be claimed, so<br>
we can ignore unclaimed for the moment.<br>
<p>
Claimed (or private) areas come in many flavors. For example, there<br>
are closely held private areas, such as the interior of a person's<br>
home. There are "cooperative" areas, such as the common areas of a<br>
private gated community, which are often not open to members of the<br>
general public. There are "private areas open to the public", such as<br>
a large park run by a private conservancy organization, which any<br>
member of the public may, generally speaking, enter. There are, of<br>
course, numerous other spaces.<br>
<p>
When I noted that one might be contractually oblidged not to go nude<br>
within common areas of a contractual community, I was thinking<br>
specifically of the case of the common areas of a gated private<br>
development or other areas not open to the general public. I was not<br>
thinking of areas such as a private park open to members of the<br>
general public.<br>
<p>
While it is possible for the owners of such spaces to obligate those<br>
entering them to wear particular clothing or even specific kinds of<br>
clothing, I am unsure about what societal norms are likely to arise in<br>
such spaces, and thus what sorts of obligations are likely to be<br>
common, and in any case the question is one more of sociology than<br>
law.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Assuming all land is owned by someone, and all law is by private</i><br>
<i>&gt; contract, all laws regarding display of nudity would also be by</i><br>
<i>&gt; private contract.</i><br>
<p>
Certainly.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would predict that in most common areas, nudity would be illegal.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not certain that this would be the case, though then again, I'm<br>
not sure it wouldn't be, either. My suspicion is that many areas open<br>
to members of the general public would not prohibit nudity. I base<br>
this suspicion on the notion that since at least some would likely<br>
permit it, social norms sanctioning this behavior would erode with<br>
time. I have no solid evidence for this notion, however.<br>
<p>
"Illegal" is a bad word, btw -- contractually forbidden is perhaps<br>
better.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As Perry indicated, most people find it tasteless, and it is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; especialy easy to define and enforce tasteless behavior in this area.</i><br>
<p>
I hope you mean "sanction tasteless behavior" rather than enforcing<br>
it. :)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That is, most people are willing to pay more to have nudity go away</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the potential nudists are willing to pay to parade around nude.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure. I suspect (again, without more than a hunch) that as<br>
people become more exposed to exposed people, the amount they will pay<br>
to be free of them would erode with time. People are happy to have a<br>
social norm enforced if they don't have to pay (at least directly) to<br>
do so, but they are less happy to do so if they would have to pay.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I would also predict widespread exceptions, accessible from most</i><br>
<i>&gt; locations, where common nudity is legal.  </i><br>
<p>
I would tend to agree, but again, based purely on personal suspicion.<br>
