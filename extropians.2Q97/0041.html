In a message dated 97-03-29 21:13:40 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You cannot simply program emotions if the hardware cannot experience<br>
<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; them. My body including my brain can experience emotions. Computers,</i><br>
as<br>
<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; of yet, cannot experience emotions, and this is not so much a software</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; problem as it is a hardware problem.</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Anders Sandberg responded:</i><br>
<i> &gt; &gt; What do you base this assertion on?</i><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; Can you merely program a computer to see without creating optical</i><br>
<i> &gt; hardware? No! You can program pattern recognizing neural nets day in and</i><br>
<i> &gt; day out, but until you give the computer hardware [optics] to see with,</i><br>
<i> &gt; it cannot see ... no matter how hard you try to program it to do so.</i><br>
<i> &gt; ...</i><br>
<i> &gt; Emotions are felt in a physical manner. I *feel* sexual pleasure via my</i><br>
<i> &gt; organs. I *feel* hunger via my organs. I *feel* excitement via my</i><br>
<i> &gt; organs. Without this specialized hardware I would *feel* nothing. As a</i><br>
<i> &gt; computer I might be "aware" of conditions, but I would not *feel* those</i><br>
<i> &gt; conditions unless someone created specialized hardware that would allow</i><br>
<i> &gt; me to *feel*.</i><br>
 <br>
<i> &gt;Like the man said, what evidence do you have of this?  The fact that</i><br>
<i> &gt;you experience physical sensations at the same time as your cognitive</i><br>
<i> &gt;state of emotion provides no evidence of which is cause and which is</i><br>
<i> &gt;effect, nor does it prove that there is anything necessary about those</i><br>
<i> &gt;physical sensations to achieve the cognitive state.  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I don't claim to be a neural expert, but I believe both the above parties are<br>
missing out on something.  All physical sensations, emotions, and thoughts<br>
actually occur in the brain itself, regardless if it seems that our arm<br>
"hurts", or our stomach "aches".  Is it not the brain which feels these<br>
things, and emotions as well?  The brain "thinks" the arm "hurts".  The arm<br>
does not actually "hurt".  The brain does, and it perceived the "hurt" being<br>
located at the arm.  Am I making any sense?<br>
