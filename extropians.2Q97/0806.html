Disclaimer:  This may be an urban legend, I have not checked up on it as I <br>
honestly don't care but...<br>
<p>
Several (10+) years ago a friend of mine claimed his brother <br>
(brother-in-law?) was with the Chicago Bears finance branch as legal <br>
counsel.  Supposedly the players would receive a check (average $11,000) on <br>
a Thursday (dunno if this was a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly payment). <br>
 These same players would be back on Tuesday of the following week begging <br>
for advance pay as they had spent the entire $11,000 over the weekend.<br>
<p>
Money can buy happiness but it can't buy common sense.<br>

It is important to note that while there is certainly a lot that <br>
additional<br>
money can do for these people, welfare cannot completely eliminate <br>
poverty.<br>
{SNIP}   It says that the poor (this is<br>
the US we are talking about, not places with real poverty) are different<br>
from the not poor in ways other than money.  Specifically, diligence,<br>
honesty, good health, and reliability are the key factors.  A child must <br>
be<br>
raised with parents that instill these values for them to have a good<br>
chance in life.  Sending welfare checks will not help assure that these<br>
values are taught.  I am not suggesting some plan of government<br>
intervention to correct this problem.  ........<br>
