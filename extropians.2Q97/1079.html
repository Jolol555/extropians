<p>
&lt;&lt; I just went throught the same thing in October. They especially didn't<br>
 like my comment that it seems that only the morons in the world are<br>
 reproducing, which seems to indicate a possible beginnning of a<br>
 devolution of the race....<br>

I have always enjoyed your comments, Michael.  This one seems to ring true.<br>
 If a "moron" can't produce anything for society, they have much more time to<br>
"reproduce".  I once heard a saying that went something like "When a man<br>
can't produce, he'll reproduce".  I'm glad we'll be able to prevent the<br>
devolution of the species, since we are going to develop scientific methods<br>
to augment all people.  As a non-moron myself, I can also attest to the<br>
difficulty of finding other non-morons to mate with.  Us thinking people have<br>
a more difficult time meeting other thinking people, since the morons are the<br>
majority.  :-)  Shawn M. Johnson<br>
