Yes, one must, when doing statistical comparisons, except groups that<br>
warp one group more than the other. Europe has nowhere near the minority<br>
youth gang crime problem as seen here in the US, as they have nowhere<br>
near the same level of minority youth gangs, unless you count the<br>
ongoing situation in the former Yugoslavia as a big gang war. Such<br>
criminals overwhelmingly commit crimes against other criminals,<br>
especially when it comes to violent crimes. Why? Partly because other<br>
minority gang youths are much more accessible than any other potential<br>
victim, partly because of the tribal rivalry dynamic involved, and also<br>
because most gang leaders know that cops will not bother them nearly as<br>
much when they are victimizing their fellows than when victimizing the<br>
white middle or upper class.<br>
<p>
Here in NH, we have a minority population of less than 1%, will little<br>
or no gang activity, with the exception of some biker gangmembers which<br>
are also very insular. Even though NH has a much higher number per<br>
capita rate of gun posession (at least 10x more guns if not much more),<br>
we have a much lower crime rate than Great Britain, more in line with<br>
possibly Scotland, and we've never had mass murders like Dunblane.<br>
Recreational gun use is very popular here, leading to a high rate in the<br>
population of responsible ownership and use of guns. Boy Scouts are<br>
taught to shoot, and there are active police explorer scout troops in<br>
most towns. The state is also very supportive of private ownership and<br>
use of guns. There are hunter safety courses in most towns certified by<br>
the state, the right of self defense is supported (and our state motto<br>
is "Live Free or Die", not an empty sentiment like most state mottos).<br>
There is also a state law excepting gun ranges and clubs from the noise<br>
restriction laws of the state or local ordinances.<br>
<p>
Also, if you look at the current violent crime statistics, nationally<br>
there was a 3% drop last year. In the 18 states that have passed<br>
"right-to-carry" concealed weapons laws recently, violent crime rates<br>
have dropped 8% in the same period, leading one to conclude that at<br>
least 80% of that 3% drop nationally occured in just those states with<br>
more liberalized concealed weapons laws, while the rest of the country<br>
changed little. So much for the success of the FBI or Clintons "crime"<br>
Bill.<br>
<p>
As for the tort issue, I think that any criminal that expresses remorse,<br>
is not considered a danger to others, and agrees to and participates in<br>
programs to help solve their own root dysfunctions that led to the<br>
crime, should be able to work on restitution, even under only house<br>
arrest (electronic monitoring), since one can typically make more money<br>
on the outside than stamping license plates in prison.<br>
<p>
However, although I support the legalization/medicalization of drug use,<br>
until it is legalized, I am rather hesitant to be so lenient with drug<br>
related criminals, mostly due to the social problems that encouraging<br>
freedom for drug pushers will exacerbate, and given that anyone<br>
convicted of drug dealing, especially if they are a minority, has a<br>
snowballs chance in hell of getting a legal job to pay restitution with,<br>
giving them in home "detention" is merely encouraging their presently<br>
illegal behavior, and that which their customers commit to get money for<br>
their habits.<br>
<p>
In the end we all know that solving our high crime rate nationally will<br>
require 1)the legalization, taxation, and regulation of drug use, and 2)<br>
the legal recognition of the right of all  majority age individuals to<br>
carry deadly force for purposes of self defense of themselves and their<br>
children/charges.<br>
