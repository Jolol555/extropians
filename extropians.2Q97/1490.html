<i>&gt; From: Mark Grant &lt;mark@unicorn.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The only wearable I've seen (I didn't actually get to use it, just saw</i><br>
<i>&gt; some graphics demonstrating what it was supposed to be like) projected</i><br>
<i>&gt; incoming data onto the inside of a pair of 'sunglasses' which also</i><br>
<i>&gt; incorporated a miniature video camera to broadcast video back over the</i><br>
Net<br>
<i>&gt; to his home machine. I certainly wouldn't want to use a wearable display</i><br>
<i>&gt; which wasn't at least semi-transparent. </i><br>
<p>
This sounds rather interesting.  It's much like something I was thinking<br>
about.  I certainly could have used a pair of sunglasses to project<br>
modernist works of literature and a Spanish dictionary today for finals. <br>
Physics and math are so much easier although my physics teacher thinks<br>
there is something unjust about 22k of programmable RAM so he didn't let us<br>
use calculators on the exam.  Of course, the guy has also devoted his life<br>
to serving God (Xaverian brother, a Catholic sect), but luckily that<br>
doesn't show up past the pray at the beginning of class (such is the price<br>
I pay for avoiding public school).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; Forget unix. Unix is not sexy. Unix is simply the lesser evil of those</i><br>
on <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the market. Make? C? Memory leaks? Dangling pointers? Core dumps? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Heretic ;-). If past experience is anything to go by then in five hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt; years time the Jupiter-sized brains will still be running Unix ;-). I do</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather like the look of what I've seen of Plan 9 though. </i><br>
<p>
Considering that one of my dreams is to become a Jupiter brain, does this<br>
mean I should learn Unix? :)<br>
