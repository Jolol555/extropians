<i>&gt; I always hated him for making the capitalist Ferrenghi such ugly</i><br>
<i>&gt; dispicable characters, as if to purposely portray anyone with a profit</i><br>
<i>&gt; motive as twisted and beneath contempt (at the time I was starting up my</i><br>
<i>&gt; first business).</i><br>
<p>
Rodenberry has always been an outright socialist, so that's no<br>
surprize.  They did, however, partially redeem themselves in an<br>
episode of DS9 when Quark and Cisco were discussing Ferengi culture.<br>
Cisco was being particularly nasty about it, and Quark reminded him<br>
that Earth had Wars, Famines, Slavery, and atrocities that Ferengi<br>
never had time for...too busy making money.  Glad some writer<br>
managed to sneak that one in.<br>
