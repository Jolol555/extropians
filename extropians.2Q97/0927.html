litenite@game-master.com thinks it's easy to make theories, compares <br>
this to dreaming!<br>
<p>
As an example of more "practical" Extropianism, litenite suggests:<br>
&lt;I'd really like to read information on where to get drugs that can <br>
make you think faster or feel a certain way.&gt;<br>
<p>
There are plenty of Web sites and online catalogs devoted to these <br>
topics - just do a search.<br>
<p>
Also,<br>
&lt;And what about existing technology?  We've made wonderful things <br>
already, much more than we usually imagine.  Why dream about future <br>
technology when there's so much we already have but don't use? [SNIP] <br>
Sure, I want to be a cyborg, but right now, precisely what can science <br>
and technology make me?&gt;<br>
<p>
Here's a somewhat facetious answer:<br>
&lt;Wearable PC: You know about virtual reality, but this is "augmented <br>
reality." Xybernaut Corp. in Fairfax, Va., has developed a <br>
speech-activated, wearable computer that helps a technician inspect <br>
and fix industrial equipment. A head-mounted display shows the online <br>
maintenance manual in an image that appears to float in front of the <br>
user and fills a viewing area equal to a 17-in. desktop monitor. The <br>
worker keeps one eye on the display and the other on the equipment. <br>
Mobile Assistant II has a base price of $4,995.&gt;<br>

<p>
Some people are mechanics and some people are visionaries.  It takes <br>
both types to make a new world.<br>
