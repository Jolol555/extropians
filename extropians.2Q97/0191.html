KA&gt; And thank *you* for illustrating an interesting linguistic<br>
KA&gt; phenomenon, the amelioration of female terms into the perjorative,...<br>
<p>
TS&gt; Oh, go and lay an egg.<br>
TS&gt; I saw right through your feminist BS in a microsecond.<br>
<p>
Sorry, Tony, but facts are facts regardless of the personalities<br>
or motives of the one who brings them up.  I'm as tired of PC<br>
whining as anyone.  I'll be the first one to stand up and shout<br>
that Hugh Hefner has done more for women's rights than Dworkin,<br>
McKinnon, and the rest of those idiots put together.  But the<br>
English language /is/ outrageously biased, and that /does/ have<br>
an effect on the way my children will grow up thinking, and I do<br>
want to do something about that.  To deny that out of emotional<br>
backlash is just as petty and irrational as Dworkin's all-sex-is-<br>
rape hogwash.<br>
<p>
When a movement like feminism loses sight of the moral foundations<br>
that created it to become an irrational us-vs-them war as it is now,<br>
the way to get it back on track is not to accept the war and fight<br>
back, but to jump out of the combative mindset and get back to the<br>
philosophies that moved its creation.<br>
