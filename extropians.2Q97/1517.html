<i>&gt;Imagine an operating system called RANDOS.  Its inventor, Rand, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;brilliant programmer, died in 1982, and consequently there are no plans</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the RANDOS Institute to release an upgraded version.  Instead, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;RANDOS Institute will publish new-and-improved user manuals, how-to</i><br>
<i>&gt;books, taped lecture courses, and international seminars explaining how</i><br>
<i>&gt;to get the most out of RANDOS 1.0.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately, RANDOS 1.0 has a particular limitation which has been</i><br>
<i>&gt;causing such a level of frustration among a growing number of users qua</i><br>
<i>&gt;users that not even _RANDOS for Dummies_ could placate them: RANDOS 1.0</i><br>
<i>&gt;only supports a maximum of 64 Kilobytes of intellectual growth--this was</i><br>
<i>&gt;more Random Access Wisdom than anybody could fathom when RANDOS was</i><br>
<i>&gt;invented, but, as information technology improved, the typical user's</i><br>
<i>&gt;capacity for growth actually expanded well beyond this barrier--a</i><br>
<i>&gt;potential which remained unfulfilled.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Some of the key personnel at the RANDOS institute, led by R&amp;D specialist</i><br>
<i>&gt;Kelley, harbored some sympathy for the concerns of their consumers. </i><br>
<i>&gt;They decided to broach the idea of expanding upon RANDOS to the CEO.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now, CEO Peikoff was not a programmer, but a grammarian who came out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the documentation department--he rose through the corporate ranks by</i><br>
<i>&gt;being Rand's consummate "Yes-man."  Peikoff deftly retorted that the 64K</i><br>
<i>&gt;cutoff was not an oversight, but a brilliant feature; he went on to</i><br>
<i>&gt;attribute all of the purported problems with RANDOS to "operator error"</i><br>
<i>&gt;because if these incompetent users would only check their "config.sys"</i><br>
<i>&gt;premises and buy more of his taped lecture courses, then they would</i><br>
<i>&gt;learn how to work around their difficulties.  He then fired all of those</i><br>
<i>&gt;within the organization who objected to this line of thought, and issued</i><br>
<i>&gt;a public statement warning that anyone who modified RANDOS would void</i><br>
<i>&gt;their warranty and that they would not be able to count on the support</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the RANDOS Institute in the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So Kelley departed and formed the Institute of Operating Systems.  IOS</i><br>
<i>&gt;published subroutines which users could patch into Rand's original</i><br>
<i>&gt;program so that it would support up to 1 Megabyte of intellectual</i><br>
<i>&gt;growth.  Initially, this seemed very exciting and controversial, but as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the information age proceeded further, and the cost of Random Access</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wisdom became more and more affordable, some users of these IOS patches</i><br>
<i>&gt;could not even live with that limitation.  Ideally--even Kelley admits</i><br>
<i>&gt;this--there should be no such limitations at all.  So IOS began to work</i><br>
<i>&gt;on more sophisticated dynamic R.A.W. allocation subroutines, but they</i><br>
<i>&gt;encountered some performance difficulties in trying to optimize between</i><br>
<i>&gt;surviving and flourishing.  They got so bogged down in the minutiae of</i><br>
<i>&gt;code development, that some users eventually ran out of patience with</i><br>
<i>&gt;the developers of RANDOS all together and began to study programming</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves so that they might be able to develop their own operating</i><br>
<i>&gt;systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the midst of their research, a handful of these independent renegades</i><br>
<i>&gt;came across an ancient system in the public domain archives called</i><br>
<i>&gt;EPICUR-OS, and although it was originally compiled to run on an abacus,</i><br>
<i>&gt;they soon realized that this program had all of the best features of</i><br>
<i>&gt;RANDOS without its shortcomings: its Hedonistic Telos Architecture, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;instance, eliminated all the switching back and forth between Survive</i><br>
<i>&gt;and Flourish Modes which allowed its users to accommodate unlimited</i><br>
<i>&gt;amounts of Random Access Wisdom without untoward propagation delays. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Additionally, its robust metaphysical parameters rendered it</i><br>
<i>&gt;modern-science-compatible, so it was quite easy for them to port over</i><br>
<i>&gt;the code for their personal applications, which they did with splendid</i><br>
<i>&gt;results.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They soon became convinced that if it weren't for the ancient JES-OS</i><br>
<i>&gt;cartel, who succeeded in outlawing their competitors, then EPICUR-OS</i><br>
<i>&gt;would have perhaps survived as the predominate operating system today.</i><br>
