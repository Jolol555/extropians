Monkeys are also able to learn language. Japanese researchers have<br>
trained monkeys to read Japanese characters (and they're hard to learn).<br>
They are also trying it vice versa: trying to learn the monkey<br>
"language". An English researcher whose name I have forgotten asked a<br>
monkey, I think it was a bonobo (they have the best learning<br>
capabilities) to perform not so very simple tasks given to him in<br>
English language ("fetch the ball out of the freezebox"), where the<br>
conditions were not trained before (i. e., the ball had never been in<br>
the freezebox before).<br>
<p>
The problem is that apes are _physically_, not mentally, unable to<br>
articulate language. When training them like someone who is deaf mute,<br>
they can learn to "speak" using a complex sign language.<br>
<p>
There's not as much research done in that area as one might expect. I<br>
think it's mainly because of humans who don't want apes to become more<br>
than uneducated animals. <br>
In Germany, there's the case of the ape "Freddy", a very interesting<br>
one, where an ape who had never met any other apes thought that he was a<br>
human. He behaved like one, too, and was very interested in contact with<br>
other humans (and not in contact with other apes). But this ape was<br>
"brainwashed", forced to return to his natural environment. Now that<br>
he's back to normal everything is fine again. But this ape might have<br>
been one of the best training objects they could ever get.<br>
<p>
Not doing simple jobs should be the work of apes, for what motivation<br>
should they have? If I was an ape, I would prefer getting my bananas for<br>
free to having to brush the streets for them. Instead a continous<br>
learning process for apes, including the use of computers and the<br>
internet, could make humanity evolve into a multi-racial environment.<br>
And the ape rights would also become a more important issue.<br>
<p>
Most apes who were used for learning objects had much fun doing it. In<br>
one project, they were given the choice to go to the "ape school"<br>
whenever they wanted to, and most of them went the long way there every<br>
day.<br>
<p>
Maybe someone can give some literature about apes and projects with<br>
them, the information above is from a TV documentation.<br>
