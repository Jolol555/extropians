I'm reading it at the moment, for the 3rd time.  The problem with Rand<br>
is that she thinks art is propaganda (see "The Romantic Manifesto"). <br>
But when she's just writing 'realistically', to convey her philosophical<br>
ideas by observation of 'the minute particularity of things' by giving a<br>
sense of time and place, rather than using her characters as ventriloquist's<br>
dummies, she's actually quite good, and the bits of plain description in<br>
her writing are the best bits of her writing qua writing.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The concepts that Rand tries so heroically to convey in her novel should</i><br>

<p>
Rand is a million miles away from Nietzsche.  She has very little sense<br>
of irony, whereas that's one of Nietzsche's major features.  I believe<br>
that she thought he was an irrationalist.  There are only superficial<br>
similarities.<br>
