The 13 June 97 Science, p 1651, mentions recent work by Murray on<br>
Income as a function of IQ and age.  Murray looks at 710 pairs of<br>
siblings, now in their 30's who have been tracked since 1979.  Each<br>
pair has one normal IQ person (890-110) and either one dull person<br>
(&lt;90) or one bright person (&gt;110).  Graphing the average income of<br>
these people as a function of time (and hence of subject's age),<br>
Murray finds the income of all three groups stays low and the same for<br>
about five years, then for the next six years the dull group gets a<br>
lower income while the top two groups stay together, and then finally<br>
the bright group splits off, ending with a income almost twice that of<br>
the dull group.<br>
<p>
Of course the article was interested in how much IQ variance<br>
contributes to income inequality, but I started thinking about how<br>
this time dependence would extend given longer lifespans.  (Warning: I<br>
never read the Bell Curve.)  <br>
<p>
Holding constant the IQ variance but extending lifespan, would income<br>
variance at the end increase?  That is, the longer time you have to<br>
work and invest in learning things, the more benefit you can get out<br>
of your higher IQ?  Or would the same income variance spread out over<br>
a longer time scale?<br>
<p>
Varing the IQ variance for a fixed lifespan, is there some maximum IQ<br>
beyond which IQ doesn't help income within the lifespan, so that<br>
longer lifespans are required to take advantage of it?<br>
<p>
Or am I tring to read too much into a few noisy data points? <br>
