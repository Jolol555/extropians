<i>&gt; I think the food combining, even though nonsense, could have beneficial</i><br>
<i>&gt; results.  </i><br>
<p>
	After more than 20 years as a vegetarian, we know something about "food<br>
combining".  We have not read the "Fit For Life" book, but the information<br>
we have has to do with the Essential Amino Acids (EAA).  The eight EAA are<br>
those which we cannot synthesize.  Our protein pattern requires that we<br>
consume these EAAs in relationship to each other at the same meal.  If a<br>
food is low in one of these EAAs, the usable protein is less.  It is a bit<br>
like building a stick man with Tinker-Toys.  If it takes, four red sticks,<br>
four blue sticks, and three round pieces to make a stick man and you have<br>
four hundred red sticks, four hundred blue sticks and thirty round pieces,<br>
you can make ten stick men.  The rest of the red sticks and blue sticks are<br>
useless for building stick men.  The limiting amino acid determines how<br>
much protein in a food is useable.  The idea behind combining foods is that<br>
you take one with lots of red sticks and round pieces but few blue sticks<br>
and combine it with one that has losts of blue sticks and few red sticks or<br>
round pieces and eat them at the same meal.  Cultures all over the world do<br>
this already.  Rice and beans are just one example of combining two foods<br>
which, by themselves are low in useable protein, but by combining them one<br>
obtains much more useable protein.<br>
  For the skeptics..."Amino Acid Content of Foods and Biological Data on<br>
Proteins, Food and Agricultural Organization of the U.N., Rome, 1970"<br>
<p>
Certainly it's better than a<br>
<i>&gt; McDonald's diet.</i><br>
