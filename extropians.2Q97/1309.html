        That is something I intended to point out a few days ago.  I can't<br>
possibly agree that extropy is a belief that is adopted.  I think that it is<br>
a part of a person that is usually unacknowledged due to the multitudes of<br>
learned behaviour and conditioning.  Many "belief-systems" are based upon<br>
trends and the self-satisfying feeling that the belief is socially<br>
acceptable.  I wouldn't say that this applies to extropy.  People *are*<br>
extropians...they, for the most part, don't just adopt futuristic and<br>
progressive beliefs for the hell of it.  That is why many on this list are<br>
militant against threads regarding eyelash bugs: it seems to be insulting to<br>
us, be it intended or no.  You would be hard-pressed to find the same ideas<br>
from your average mystic.<br>
