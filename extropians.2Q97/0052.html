03/28/97. _Life Itself_ ch.5 is called "Entailment Without States:<br>
Relational Biology", and in 5A and 5B Rosen recognizes the pioneering<br>
work of Nicholas Rashevsky who, in the 1930s (predating even Hebb's<br>
cell-assembly work in the '40s), "conceived the pregnant idea of<br>
stringing excitable elements into networks"; but, by the 1950s had<br>
realized that "no collection of separate /descriptions/ (i.e., =<br>
/models/)<br>
of organisms, however, comprehensive, could be pasted together to<br>
capture the organism itself.... Rashevsky is saying that we must look<br>
for a principle that governs the way in which phenomena are =<br>
/organized/,<br>
a principle that governs the /organization/ of the phenomena, rather<br>
than the phenomena themselves."=20<br>
<p>
Mathematically, Rosen says, "the trick is to consider what happens on<br>
certain /sets/ of phases of that underlying particulate system, rather<br>
than on individual phases, and to express this in a /probabilistic/<br>
language.... The Second Law thus asserts that /a closed system cannot<br>
autonomously tend to an organized state/. Or, contrapositively, /a<br>
system autonomously tending to an organized state cannot be closed/."<br>
<p>
In 5D, "The Concept of Function", Rosen warns that this "has overtones<br>
of end, purpose, finality, [though] nowadays it is considered again<br>
acceptable to talk of function, because natural selection and the<br>
adaptive evolutionary processes it generates can, it is supposed, be<br>
invoked to exorcise any finalistic demons." Rosen talks about how<br>
through "willful, active intervention" and observation, "the =<br>
discrepancy<br>
between the two /systems/ [before and after] defines the concept of<br>
/component/; the discrepancy between the /behaviors/ defines the<br>
/function/ of the component."<br>
<p>
In 5E, "On the Strategy of Relational Modeling", Rosen continues to<br>
emphasize the distinction between relational and traditional<br>
reductionist approaches by saying: "I can epitomize a reductionist<br>
approach ... as follows: throw away the organization  and keep the<br>
underlying matter." But he emphasizes, "there is nothing in the<br>
relational strategy that is unphysical ... The organization of a =<br>
natural<br>
system ... is at least as much a part of its material reality as the<br>
specific particles that constitute it at a given time, perhaps indeed<br>
more so."<br>
<p>
5F, "The Component", talks about how "the component may be thought of =<br>
as<br>
the /particle of function/"; and 5G discusses "Systems from Components"<br>
via mappings, circuits, compositions and the "abstract block diagrams"<br>
Rosen uses to describe these. In 5H, "Entailment in Relational =<br>
Systems",<br>
Rosen claims to "have made a gentle and natural progression from<br>
/organization/ to /function/ to /component/, and thence back to<br>
organization."=20<br>
<p>
He describes how "inner entailments are of a restricted kind; only<br>
/elements of sets/ can be entailed thereby." Whereas, "outer =<br>
entailments<br>
allow us to entail (in fact, to /construct/) mappings from mappings in<br>
the category, and sets from sets." Here, he says, "we must invoke a<br>
category axiom, the one that allows composition of mappings [and] gives<br>
us an inferential rule F of precisely the form F(f,g) =3D gf [such =<br>
that]<br>
gf can be regarded as an /effect/, the pair (f,g) is its material =<br>
cause,<br>
and the inferential rule F is its efficient cause.... But it is crucial<br>
to keep in mind that this inferential rule F, which governs the<br>
entailment of mappings from mappings, is not /in/ the category; /it =<br>
does<br>
not encode a component/".<br>
<p>
02/09/97. _Life Itself_ 5I introduces final causation &amp; functional<br>
entailment: "by invoking the concept of design ... we are talking about<br>
finality. This is alright when we talk about machines as human<br>
fabrications, but it is manifestly not alright to consider organisms in<br>
such terms.... The traditional argument is that the produce of an<br>
evolutionary process give the /appearance/ of design but without any of<br>
the finalistic implications of design". Final causation is inconsistent<br>
in the Newtonian picture, but not in the relational picture where "a<br>
component is entailed by its function"; but, Rosen hastens to add, this<br>
"does not connote anything vitalistic or transphysical in material<br>
nature".<br>
<p>
In 5J, on "Augmented Block Diagrams", Rosen claims that it is possible<br>
to entail mappings because the mappings from one set to another are<br>
themselves a set AND also a mapping. He is building a case for =<br>
recursive<br>
relations between system components as the basis of biology, vs. the<br>
recursive chronicling of separate components that is the basis of<br>
mechanics.<br>
<p>
03/15/97. In 5K of _Life Itself_, on finality &amp; entailment in 'abstract<br>
block diagrams', Rosen argues that "finality is allied to the notion of<br>
possibility, while the other causal categories involve necessity". He<br>
shows how, with relational models, "there can be many distinct,<br>
different ways of entailing the effect f(a) (i.e., of executing the<br>
function), between which final causation cannot distinguish".<br>
<p>
Finally, in 5L (p143), Rosen describes the Theory of Categories that he<br>
has been leading up to: "The Theory of Categories arose out of topology<br>
[and] the Cauchy concept of convergence ... a mapping is continuous if<br>
it commutes with the operation of taking limits of sequences; if the<br>
image of a limit is the limit of the images.... convergence and<br>
continuity are local concepts ... the traditional figures of the<br>
geometer are not local objects.... The obvious way to connect the two<br>
... is to tie the notion of congruence (a global notion) to that of<br>
continuity (a local one) ... we need continuous mappings (to preserve<br>
the local structure) that are also invertible (so as to form a group)."<br>
<p>
"In a word, we are led to the homeomorphisms, which turn a topological<br>
space into a geometry in the sense of Klein.... If we wish to retain =<br>
the<br>
original geometric flavor of the Klein Program and treat individual<br>
topological spaces as 'figures', we can see ourselves being led toward =<br>
a<br>
category of all topological spaces.... There is thus the problem of<br>
trying to decide whether two particular topological spaces are<br>
homeomorphic or not. This is the Classification Problem ... One way to<br>
approach it is ... in terms of invariants, with numbers or other =<br>
objects<br>
that are constant on the equivalence classes.... The trouble is that<br>
nonhomeomorphic spaces may also get the same number ... Most of what is<br>
presently available in these directions goes back to Poincare ... it<br>
embodies a very syntactical approach to topology."<br>
<p>
Rosen then describes the progression from points, zero-simplexes, to<br>
line segments, one-simplexes, to chains, two simplexes, to arrays of<br>
such simplexes, complexes, and continues: "the boundary operation,<br>
appropriately generalized, is a homomorphism between groups of chains =<br>
of<br>
successive dimensions ... if S1, S2 are two complexes, and f: S1 -&gt; S =<br>
is<br>
a continuous mapping between them, there is a corresponding group<br>
homomorphism Hn(f): Hn(S1):-&gt; Hn(S2) for each n [nth homology group]; =<br>
if<br>
f is a homeomorphism, then Hn(f) is an isomorphism.... These Hn are<br>
examples of functors. They basically associate groups Hn(S) with<br>
complexes S ... It is most important to observe that such factors do<br>
not, in general, associate or encode elements (points) of S with<br>
elements of Hn(S).... In fact, all we retain about S is that some of =<br>
its<br>
points lie on boundaries that separate others; i.e., a relational<br>
property. Indeed, the relation between S and the Hn(s) is what we<br>
earlier termed a metaphorical one.... And it is important to note that<br>
the metaphor from the Hn(S) to S ... runs in the opposite direction as<br>
the functor itself (i.e., from spaces to groups). That is, we decode =<br>
the<br>
range of the functor to its domain."=20<br>
<p>
"Category Theory itself embodies this picture but divorces it =<br>
completely<br>
from any specific referents. Thus, in place of the topological spaces<br>
and groups of algebraic topology, we have unspecified objects; in place<br>
of continuous mappings and group homomorphisms, we have correspondingly<br>
unspecified morphisms. In fact, we can even dispense with the objects<br>
and proceed entirely on the basis of morphisms alone. We only require<br>
that morphisms can be composed, just as mappings can, and that this<br>
composition is associative.... We can take functors as objects of a new<br>
category, with natural transformations providing the morphisms between<br>
them. And we can keep doing this, iterating this procedure, so that the<br>
functors and natural transformations arising at any given level become<br>
the objects and morphisms for the next. In a certain sense, then,<br>
Category Theory can talk about itself, or describe itself, in ways more<br>
nearly akin to natural languages than to the formal systems that<br>
normally constitute mathematics.... It can be used as a kind of<br>
transducer, to move ideas and methods from one part of mathematics to<br>
another."<br>
