On Sat, 5 Apr 1997 Sylvia Maxwell wrote about how<br>
&lt;it is possible for people to "feel" fluctustions in energy fields <br>
around other popele.  we interpret these as exhuded "moods" but they <br>
are not... bees and seom animals are very clever at feeling these <br>
"moods". &gt;<br>
<p>
On Mon, 7 Apr 1997, Eugene Leitl commented:<br>
&lt;??? Not unless you are heavily augmented. Like SQUID arrays, to see <br>
EM activity, and nitrogen cooled imagers to pick up IR blackbody... <br>
Nothing but body chemistry, and interpreting subtle body language.&gt;<br>
<p>
On the same day, Anders Sandberg suggested:<br>
&lt;It might feel that, since our ability to interpret the state of other <br>
people is largely subconscious - just think of those pheromones. We <br>
have elaborate limbic systems to deal with this [SNIP] It would be <br>
interesting to develop limbic enhancements; we tend to think  far too <br>
much about improving our cognition without thinking of the need  to <br>
improve our social abilities. Enhanced Empathy, anyone?&gt;<br>
<p>
Perhaps Sylvia was tip-toeing around the subject of 'auras'.  The TFE <br>
catalog I mentioned yesterday sells 'aura goggles'<br>
<a href="http://tools4explore.com/TFE85.HTM#LO450">http://tools4explore.com/TFE85.HTM#LO450</a><br>
and a whole bunch of stuff under the category of 'subtle energy <br>
products'<br>

<p>
I suspect the skeptics have serious arguments regarding this 'subtle <br>
energy' stuff, and I think Anders is probably on the right track in <br>
pointing out that we have a lot of subconscious routines that assemble <br>
all sorts of subtle signals from various senses to produce what we <br>
call our intuitions.<br>
<p>
So, when Eugene says "NOTHING BUT body chemistry, and interpreting <br>
subtle body language" (my emphasis), I would say, this is probably the <br>
MOST complex system there is, and harder to study than our <br>
'higher-level' cognitive functions.<br>
<p>
Aside from the psychological processing involved, there could be a <br>
whole lot more to the basic processes of 'chemical communication' than <br>
we realize.  Linda Nagata builds most of her recent novel, _Deception <br>
Well_, around this subject.  Here are a few tantalizing snips from <br>
that story:<br>
<p>
&lt;The Communion made here was flawed and corrupt. It had no center, no <br>
focus, and so it could not grow by conquest but only by slow <br>
accretion,, a confused, disjointed intellect operating forever out of <br>
sync ... A  biochemical dialogue in the Chenzeme way. The suspended <br>
data patterns seek consensus ... Death masquerading as salvation ... <br>
The Cult Virus. A gift from the void, a parasite that had lain in <br>
wait, patiently seeking a new host ... manufactured nirvana, <br>
short-term plan ... a feedback reaction, notably devoid of choice ... <br>
Information streamed in chemical currents through the dust, flashing <br>
occasionally into the electromagnetic spectrum astride erratic signals <br>
barely distinguishable from the static. Halfway down the sheltered <br>
Well, human lives burned in the warm infrared, oblivious of the <br>
whispered exchange. Dust sifted past them, falling into the <br>
atmosphere, into oceans, taken into the colloidal flow, perhaps rising <br>
again with storms, escaping the atmosphere aboard some unknown ferry. <br>
Information was traded and adjustments were made in feedback reactions <br>
working on alien protocols encoded in the dust, long ago, while the <br>
Communion waited: alert, patient. The dust was alive. Lot wondered why <br>
he hadn't understood that before ... Dreaming dust. A system replete <br>
with information, but operating without foresight, without <br>
consciousness, Selective processes rewarding survival ... tiny judges, <br>
forever untouched by mercy or forgiveness ... Maybe success could <br>
never be measured except in the transcendent power of a moment, the <br>
grace of an hour, or a day, short spans of hallowed time, like brief <br>
poems, sparkling gems set in the flowing matter of space-time. There <br>
is no finish line. Only a collection of small victories, and the <br>
choice to go on. Choice was a privilege not shared by the Well or the <br>
Chenzeme marauders.&gt;<br>
