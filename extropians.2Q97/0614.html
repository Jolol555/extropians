<i>&gt;I have no source, but for what it's worth, I read that the nervous system</i><br>
<i>&gt;has a theoretical lifespan of 120 years and would be the limiting factor in</i><br>
<i>&gt;human lifespan overall, in other words, other tissues could function much</i><br>
<i>&gt;longer.</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; The subject says it - I've heard that the potential lifespan of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; human brain is quite a bit longer than that of the rest of our body.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Can anyone confirm/deny this?</i><br>
<p>
Someone suggested that the cholinergic systems may remain intact with age or <br>
even hold regenerating capabilities. Yet it is this very system's <br>
degeneration that is implicated in Alzheimer's and other age-related <br>
dementias. My work is in the aging brain and I have yet to see someone whose <br>
neurologic function is preserved despite a deteriorating body. Further, any <br>
number of common diseases and syndromes associated with aging, such as heart <br>
disease, stroke, high blood pressure, etc., have significant effects on the <br>
brain, such as affecting its blood supply. In the real world the mind is <br>
inseperable from the body. I can't imagine how one can conclude that the brain <br>
has even a theroetical lifespan seperable from the rest of the body. Be nice <br>
if some evidence could be presented, or even an appeal to authority by way of <br>
a reference...<br>
