In addition, we are social animals.  Calls for assistance from "gods" or<br>
"spirits" can only be expected to have some effect on other people about<br>
(especially if they believe in the same gods or spirits).<br>

An amusing (and possibly apocryphal) example of this comes from the early<br>
history of the University of Chicago.  The college was having money troubles,<br>
as it often did.  Harper, the president, went to Rockefeller, who had original<br>
ly funded the school, to ask for more money.  Rockefeller, who had already<br>
been through several rounds of this, said that Harper could talk about<br>
anything he liked, as long as he didn't ask for more money.  Harper then just<br>
asked Rockefeller to get down on his knees and help Harper pray for the<br>
salvation of the school.<br>
<p>
Harper got his money.<br>
