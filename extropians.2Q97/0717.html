I agree, although I prefer art that gets you thinking about some more <br>
definite area. Still, it was a quite amusing trick (I didn't have the <br>
time to get involved in interpreting it).<br>
<p>
Sometimes art can be quite subtle. One of my favorite "artworks" was when<br>
Dan Wolgers made an installation for an exhibition about "The Human<br>
Condition" a few years back: he stole two benches from the exhibition hall<br>
and sold them.  In the ensuing uproar he got quite many swedes to argue<br>
about the nature of art, which would never have happened otherwise. The<br>
big question is IMHO if his theft was the artwork, or the ensuing<br>
controversy which he had clearly anticipated. <br>
<p>
I wonder if one could extend this form of ideas of provoking thinking to <br>
other areas, such as science. <br>
