<p>
I'm not indifferent; it's just that there's nothing I can tell you that your<br>
doctor won't already know. Eat less, eat healthy, exercise, take an aspirin a<br>
day, etc, etc.  By "virtue" of being the leading cause of death, heart<br>
attacks are well-understood.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let me help you in your discourse, first you must have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;heart  attack,  then go to any major hospitalis  ER, and  lastly  you </i><br>
<i>&gt;must believe that death is only 5 feet behind you, and gaining with each</i><br>
<i>&gt;second that passes.  After that, you might reprogram  your discussions</i><br>
<i>&gt;concerning God. </i><br>
<p>
I'm not entirely unfamiliar with that.  I've had a stroke and gone to the<br>
hospital unable to walk straight, speak clearly, write, or distingush between<br>
dream and reality.  I was informed that this was AIDS, and when it became<br>
clear it wasn't that, that it was an inoperable brain tumor (it wasn't that<br>
either).  As it developed, it was just a stroke (embolic or migrainous), and<br>
a small one, and I recovered.  Although the experience changed my faith in<br>
doctors' accuracy, it didn't change my non-faith in God(s).<br>
