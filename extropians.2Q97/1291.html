Yup.  A typical burst is 10^50 ergs if the source is 3000 megaparsecs away<br>
and radiating equally in all directions.  The intensity here is 10^-7<br>
ergs/cm^2.  If it was light instead of gamma rays, it would be as bright as<br>
a 10 watt bulb two miles away, i.e. clearly visible to a dark-adapted eye.<br>

Tight-beam vs omnidirectional is hard to decide obsrvationally.  As far as I<br>
know, we can't tell yet.<br>
<p>
If they do originate with stuff plowing into the interstellar medium at<br>
<i>&gt;.9995 c, since we only see the radiation from the stuff that's aimed right</i><br>
at us, there could perfectly well be a shell of stuff expanding in all<br>
directions, and sending a burst in all directions, and it would look to us<br>
like a tight-beam phenomenon.  In this case, the visible effect hours or<br>
days afterward would be the fireball produced by the stuff after it had<br>
decellerated to a moderate .99 c (say).<br>
