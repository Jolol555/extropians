<i>&gt;it fails even to send a shiver down my spine.</i><br>
<p>
It *should* send a shiver down your spine.  Okay, that's not creepy enough,<br>
get this: gamma rays at the density of lead are as opaque to gamma rays as<br>
lead is.  In other words, if you could pile up such a ball of gammas, they<br>
wouldn't be able to get out!  Only the ones at the surface would be able to<br>
escape, then the ones beneath them, etc.  The time it would take for all the<br>
radiation to dribble out would be longer than the duration of a gamma ray<br>
burst.  So it impossible to get gamma rays out of an object as small as a<br>
burster in times as fast as a burster.<br>
<p>
How to solve this problem?  Well, if whathever makes the burst is moving<br>
towards us at close to the speed of light, it will be running just behind<br>
the light that we see it with, so we will see things on it happening faster<br>
than they actually occur.  It turns out that it is possible to get the<br>
energy release of a burster if the source is moving toward us at 0.9995 c or<br>
faster.  Moreover, it turns out that pretty much anything moving at that<br>
speed through the interstellar medium will make a gamma ray burst when it<br>
plows into interstellar hydrogen atoms.  The plowing process takes many<br>
hours before the projectile slows down, but we see it compressed into a few<br>
seconds because the projectile is traveling only a smidgen behind the gamma<br>
rays it produces.  So *something* is throwing around chunks of stuff at<br>
unheard-of speeds, by mechanisms unknown.  <br>
<p>
If the chunks are not moving directly toward us, we wouldn't see them nearly<br>
as easily because almost all the radiation is emitted in the forward<br>
direction.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Which processes can be _that_ energetic? Even if we assume colliding</i><br>
<i>&gt;neutron stars, travelling at their usual kinetical + gravitational</i><br>
<i>&gt;potential energy, and assume a high conversion efficiency (several </i><br>
<i>&gt;10%) to gamma, intuitively this doesn't suffice. </i><br>
<p>
Actually, a conversion efficiency of 0.1% of the mass would be entirely<br>
sufficient.  Remember that a 3000 km ball of lead is only the mass of a<br>
largish planet.  Convert Neptune into pure energy and you'd have a pretty<br>
good gamma ray burst.  Since stars are thousands of times more massive than<br>
planets, a conversion efficiency of 10^-3 is plenty.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I don't have</i><br>
<i>&gt;Carl's envelopes at the house, could anyone give some ballpark figures</i><br>
<i>&gt;on energetics of such events?</i><br>
<p>
10^50 ergs at 3000 megaparsecs.  It's a big envelope.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If a hole eats a pulsar in one fell gulp, how much energy is released</i><br>
<i>&gt;then? </i><br>
<p>
10^53 ergs.  Most of the energy in that case goes into neutrinos and gravity<br>
waves, but there might be enough left over to make a burst (by mechanisms<br>
unknown, ha ha!)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And why does my every darn sentence seem to end with a question</i><br>
<i>&gt;mark, today? </i><br>
<p>
Well, nobody understands these things.  At least now that we know they come<br>
from cosmic distances, we can throw out *half* of the theories that people<br>
have come up with.  A few years, there were 100 theories and less than 100<br>
known bursts.  Now there are 1000 bursts and only about two dozen theories.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since we are at the holes, and evaporating primeval singularties should</i><br>
<i>&gt;give a fair gamma flash (how fast? did somebody record the GBR spectral</i><br>
<i>&gt;changes)? before winking out, can one look out of them? (But these should</i><br>
<i>&gt;be very rapid, and extremely faint, being observable just in low lightyear</i><br>
<i>&gt;range).</i><br>
<p>
Doesn't work.  The intensity-vs-time curves of observed bursts are very<br>
variable, and often start fast and end slow, while evaporating primordial<br>
black holes all look the same, and start slow and end fast. <br>
<p>
I know so much about this because I just read an article on the topic in a<br>
nifty book called "Unsolved Problems in Astrophysics".  The book was written<br>
nine months ago, so it's only slightly obsolete.  I think astrophysics is<br>
running on Internet time nowadays.  <br>
