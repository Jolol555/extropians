Actually, all he would need to read is the chapter entitled "Conservation of<br>
Energy", in either the Feynman Lectures on Physics, or in the new book Six<br>
Easy Pieces, which collects six lectures from the big books that are<br>
particularly easy for the public to understand.  That chapter is amusing,<br>
entirely clear, entirely convincing, and sufficiently simple for an<br>
intelligent child to understand (I know this because I read it when I was an<br>
intelligent child.)  People who don't believe in the conservation of energy<br>
should read this; if they still disagree, we can at least have an<br>
intelligent debate.<br>
<p>
Richard Feynman (who was also my father) divided perpetual motion machines<br>
into Perpetual Motion Machines of the First Kind, which violate the first<br>
law of thermodynamics (AKA conservation of energy), Perpetual Motion<br>
Machines of the Second Kind, which violate the second law of thermodynamics<br>
(entropy must increase), and Those Other Perpetual Motion Machines, which<br>
purport to get their energy from other laws of physics.  <br>
<p>
CALYK's alternator-drives-electrolyzer-drives-engine-drives-alternator<br>
machine is a typical example of the First Kind.  They are the most common<br>
kind, and usually pretty lame. <br>
<p>
The Second Kind is rarer; the only example I'm familiar with is one that my<br>
dad showed me the plans for.  Once in a while, someone would come to him<br>
with a perpetual motion machine prospectus and ask if it was a good<br>
investment.  One of these was a machine that claimed to extract heat energy<br>
from the air and run a generator with it.  They had built half the machine,<br>
which worked as far as they could test it, and were looking for gullible<br>
investors to pay for finishing it.  By carefully going over the immensely<br>
complex  plans, my father and I found a "heat exchanger" that was supposed<br>
to take warm freon and cool air, and produce hot freon and cold air.<br>
Naturally, this heat exchanger was in the as-yet unbuilt portion. <br>
<p>
Those Other Perpetual Motion Machines get their energy from heretofore<br>
unknown physics, like cold fusion, vacuum fluctuations, or secret new<br>
physical laws that will be disclosed only on the payment of $1,000,000.<br>
These are worthy of much more serious physical investigation, since it is<br>
entirely concievable that someone will discover a new easy way of making<br>
energy.  Cold fusion is the most famous recent example of this type. It's a<br>
pity it doesn't actually seem to work. <br>
<p>
Back around 1970, my father went to a public demonstration of one of Those<br>
Other Perpetual Motion Machines. He discovered an electric cord running out<br>
of the back of the machine, plugged into the wall.  When he unplugged the<br>
machine and pointed out to the inventor that a perpetual motion machine that<br>
had to be plugged in wasn't really perpetual, the inventor pushed a button<br>
on the control panel and the machine exploded.  Several spectators were<br>
severely injured; I believe one man lost an arm.  The inventor sued my<br>
father on the grounds that he had caused the explosion; my father suspected<br>
that the explosion was deliberate.  The trial ended up with my father not<br>
having to pay.<br>
