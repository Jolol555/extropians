<i>&gt;        &gt;you have to be able to identify your counterpart, </i><br>
<i>&gt;                        </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You have to know your in the game, that your counterpart exists, but you </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't have to identify him.</i><br>
<p>
Not true. If you can't determine specifically who you are dealing with in<br>
any iteration you can't perform the tit-for-tat strategy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;and rough parity has to exist         </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by this but I'll add one, your counterpart can't  </i><br>
<i>&gt;be too clever. If your opponent's strategy is too complex it will look</i><br>
random <br>
<i>&gt;to you and you won't be able to play along. One good thing about tit-for-tat </i><br>
<i>&gt;is that it's simple.</i><br>
<p>
What you say is substantiated by the descriptions in the book.<br>
<p>
But what I was talking about is that you can't be massively outgunned. It's<br>
related to "the consequences have to matter". Cooperation as an ESS appears<br>
to require that the entities cooperating be similar in strength and<br>
capacity to do harm--at least within the model as described. Sharks have<br>
little reason to cooperate with halibut. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;        &gt;you have to be able to not tell if this is the last time you'll</i><br>
ever         <br>
<i>&gt;        &gt;encounter the other party</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;True. I don't have a very high opinion of US Senators but they almost always </i><br>
<i>&gt;keep their promises, those made to other Senators that is. Having a</i><br>
reputation <br>
<i>&gt;for honesty among fellow Senators is to your advantage so you work at it,   </i><br>
<i>&gt;developing such a reputation with Mr. Joe Average would be no great benefit </i><br>
<i>&gt;so the hell with it.</i><br>
<p>
This is one of the hidden (or at least unpiblicized) costs of term limits.<br>
It increases the "lame duck" period when elected officials can't be sure<br>
their logrolling will pay off. "Why should I cut a deal with Senator X,<br>
he's a short-timer."<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the First World War the same solders sometimes fought each other from </i><br>
<i>&gt;their trenches for months at a time, they started to get polite, no</i><br>
artillery <br>
<i>&gt;attacks at dinner time or when bathing, they let the wounded be evacuated</i><br>
and <br>
<i>&gt;the mail truck get through. The  Generals thought things were getting a </i><br>
<i>&gt;little too comfy so they started to rotate the troops around more often and</i><br>
<i>&gt;the cooperation ended.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From what I've read, there was a great deal more done than that, including</i><br>
senior officers forcing charges at gunpoint.<br>
