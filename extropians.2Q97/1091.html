Erik Moeller has been spewing some astounding nonsense in his last<br>
ditch effort to try to defend Fidel Castro. He writes:<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Media propaganda.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; WHose? The Cuban Government jams all US radio and television boradcasts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to the point of occasionally interfering in the southern Florida</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; broadcast market area. Cubans get a banana version of the BBC: 3</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; channels of government propaganda.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I do not only see TV and radio as media, but also people. Trained</i><br>
<i>&gt; demagogues who are supposed to infiltrate Cuba.</i><br>
<p>
Well, you know, trained demagogues are out in force all over the world<br>
defending Cuba -- take you, for example. And yet, we don't see people<br>
fleeing the west for the socialist paradise.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Such operations have always taken place, not only in Cuba, but in</i><br>
<i>&gt; other countries, too. When you see big demonstrations in the Tv,</i><br>
<i>&gt; like in Bosnia, Bulgaria etc., this can only be the effect of media</i><br>
<i>&gt; propaganda.</i><br>
<p>
You know, its amazing how close that assessment is to the one that<br>
Richard Nixon gave for anti-Vietnam war protests. "Outside<br>
Agitators". No one on their own could *possibly* dislike someone like<br>
Slobodan Milosovich -- after all, he's the friend of the workers,<br>
right?<br>
<p>
I bet the wall fell in East Germany because of those darn trained<br>
"outside agitators" too, just like with the student protests in the<br>
'60s in the U.S.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This little Cuba is, besides North Korea, one of the last socialist</i><br>
<i>&gt; regimes which doesn't privatize itself too much. The effects on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people living there are bad, and maybe free markets would make the</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard of living better for many of them (making Cuba what it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; under Batista, the brothel and casino of the US)</i><br>
<p>
Yeah. Right now, its so much better with it being the brothel and<br>
casino of the European countries that send tourists.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; -- but if Cuba was a free market country and isolated the way it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; now, you can be sure that it would be much worse there than in North</i><br>
<i>&gt; Korea.</i><br>
<p>
Dunno. South Africa managed to do pretty well even when it was under<br>
sanctions. Of course, Cuba isn't *really* isolated -- the government<br>
is free to buy anything it likes from Canada, Europe, and South<br>
America. Sanctions there are astoundingly porous -- Americans can even<br>
go there pretty freely if you travel through Mexico or Canada.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When you claim that they spread propaganda, you must prove it. It has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been proven for US media millions of times (see media during Vietnam &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Gulf War, presidential elections etc.)</i><br>
<p>
Walter Cronkite's painful declaration on the evening news that the war<br>
in Vietnam wasn't a good thing must be a collective hallucination of<br>
the proletariat, eh?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; And the media in the US aren't owned by gov't. Why do they support</i><br>
<i>&gt; it?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe they have this weird idea that its better to be in a free<br>
country where they can print what they like?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am no communist. I wouldn't want to live in Cuba, North Korea or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; China. I already said that my "dream-economy" is that of Japan,</i><br>
<i>&gt; partially because of state intervention, partially because of a kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "politics of consent".</i><br>
<p>
I see you know at least as much about Japan as you do about most other<br>
things.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Big enterprise leaders there have realized that operating the way US</i><br>
<i>&gt; leaders do would lead their country back to the Middle Age.</i><br>
<p>
Strange that the U.S. isn't back in the middle ages. I guess we just<br>
have a shortage of cathedrals and hand illuminated manuscripts<br>
standing between us and economic chaos.<br>
