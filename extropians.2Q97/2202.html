JKC writes<br>
: &gt; In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than<br>
: &gt; the desire to kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger.<br>
<p>
S.J. Van Sickle writes<br>
: Unfortunately,  I don't believe this is true.  There have evolved<br>
: systems of memes whose *sole* purpose is to get you to value killing<br>
: the other guy *more than your own life* (let alone net worth).<br>
: Examples include certain muslim beliefs about jihad and paradise,<br>
: the christian Crusades, Maoist revolutionary theory, and the<br>
: extremely sophisticated psychological manipulation in Army and Marine<br>
: basic training.  "A rational army *would* run".<br>
<p>
Are these phenomena pervasive enough to overcome JKC's "In general"?<br>
I have yet to encounter such a fanatic in daily life.<br>
<p>
Also, these fanatics generally (there's that word again) have a goal<br>
other than simple killing.  The Crusaders didn't care about wiping<br>
Islam from the world, just from the Holy Land.  The suicide bombers<br>
of today may have a secret desire to kill all Americans, but they<br>
mainly kill soldiers in Arabia.  And so on.<br>
<p>
(How many of the Crusaders went by their own choice, and how many<br>
were dragged along by their feudal lord?)<br>
<p>
	[...]<br>
: &gt; Jews  would be willing to pay as much as necessary, up to and<br>
: &gt; including their entire net worth not to be killed. I doubt if<br>
: &gt; even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%.<br>
:<br>
: Ah, but what if you can con someone else into paying the price for<br>
: you?<br>
<p>
One more good reason to abolish taxes.<br>
