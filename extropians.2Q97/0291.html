I like this little probe.<br>
Also find it interesting, for it suggests another way in which Cartesian<br>
dualism has crept into our concepts of cognition. There seems to be a huge<br>
misconception (especially in the AI community but everywhere ) that human<br>
emotions are *separate* from cognition.<br>
<p>
<p>
It should seem very obvious that human emotion is part and parcel of our<br>
thinking processes. <br>
Focus changes the way in which we utilize this (sorry Lee, I tend to disagree<br>
with Ayn Rand that high focus thinking is the only useful sort).  Using logic<br>
and reason is only one element of our capacity to think, and it is for the<br>
most part void of emotion.<br>
It's values and virtues are magnificent, but limited and numb in their own<br>
way.<br>
There are lots of ways in which the mind uses higher emotions ( and perhaps<br>
lower as well ) to display some of it's awesome powers - most noticeably in<br>
the arts. <br>
Emotion, by providing great insight and intuitive flashes, and OF COURSE,<br>
inspiration to continue,  makes for great thinkers in all aspects of<br>
creativity.<br>
And of course emotion is the thought process behind communication, empathy,<br>
achievement, love, and other affect linked activities which make us human.<br>
It is striking and revealing that Turing  made it quite clear that a machine<br>
must not be "as smart as a human" in order to be considered intelligent, but<br>
somehow must fool us into thinking it *IS* a human....<br>
Whether or not I agree with this test as the final word in AI  is not<br>
relevant, what remains is the paradigm that in order to simulate human<br>
cognition, we think in terms of the whole spectrum of thought, not just<br>
logic.<br>
