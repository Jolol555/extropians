In response to:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Last night I found myself in a futile conversation.  I couldn't tell at<br>
 &lt;first if this woman was on a mystic-trip or actually in touch with<br>
 &lt;reality, but I new it was over when she said, "Have you read _The<br>
 &lt;Celestine Prophesy_?"  I'm sure many of you have been there...<br>
 &lt;<br>
 &lt;The woman I conversed with exhibited a pattern of thought that I've noticed<br>
in<br>
 &lt;numerous conversations with New Agers:  They can rebuke any attempt at<br>
 &lt;rational thought b/c their belief system allows them to say anything,<br>
 &lt;making up mind-fodder as they go along.  Now, many of you who are far more<br>
 &lt;leathal at intellectual sparring than I are surely more successful at<br>
arguing<br>
 &lt;with mystics than I.  My arguing skills are need of developement (hence<br>
 &lt;this post).  As I struggle to put together rational replies to their<br>
 &lt;fanciful ramblings, these mystics run circles around my logic.  How do<br>
 &lt;experienced rational thinkers deal with people who can say anything (that<br>
 &lt;is to the extent that they can be dealt with)?<br>
 &lt;<br>
 &lt;Also, these people think they are quantum mechanics, rigging their<br>
 &lt;silliness with quatum "stuff."  These people don't even have a clue about<br>
the<br>
 &lt;concept of a quantized energy packet, yet they think that watching _Quantum<br>
 &lt;Leap_ or reading books by quacks who give no references gives them<br>
 &lt;understanding enough to invoke quantum physics as "proof" of their<br>
 &lt;madness.  I know just enough about quantum mechanics to know not to f***<br>
 &lt;with it, yet they don't notice that the people who do know what they're<br>
 &lt;talking about spend years, if not decades, understanding quantum mechanics<br>
 &lt;to the extent that is understood.  These fruit-loops are a sad lot.  <br>
 &lt;<br>
 &lt;Enough angst.  <br>
 &lt;<br>

I have encountered similar situations.  Mystics are mystics.  Trying to<br>
reason with someone who thinks they know all the answers, people who are not<br>
seeking to discover what "reality" is, but rather seek mysticism, is futile.<br>
 Once you've told them the idea of rationality, or how to observe, and make<br>
opinions based on those observations, with the right to alter the opinions<br>
with further evidence, then, if they haven't accepted the unprovability of<br>
mysticism, they are beyond our help.  My advice is, once you determine<br>
someone to be hopelessly irrational, only deal with them when neccessary.<br>
 Seek other companions (ones who think).<br>
