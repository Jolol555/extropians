<i>&gt; The guy in Psychedelic Illuminations had the plans and said that the car</i><br>
<i>&gt; worked. Why would he lie? He didn't mention power plants producing</i><br>
<i>&gt; hydrogen. He just mentioned water and a few (small) batteries.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, the car works, as we already said.  Of course it does.  Everyone<br>
knows Hydrogen power works.  It's old technology.  No big deal.<br>
Now, the $64,000 question: where does the Hydrogen come from?  From<br>
water.  How do you extract it?  By electrolysis.  How much power does<br>
the electrolysis take?  More than produced by the combustion of the<br>
resulting Hydrogen.  No free lunch.<br>
<p>
"Why would he lie?" is the mantra of conspiracy loonies everywhere,<br>
and is an irrational question.  People lie because sometimes it's<br>
in their interest.  To sell magazines and books.  To get publicity<br>
they wouldn't otherwise.  To embarrass people they feel inferior to.<br>
Because they heard something and don't have the ability or inclination<br>
to verify it.  Because it's fun.  To cover their asses or hide their<br>
tracks.  Because they're insane.  Take your pick.<br>
