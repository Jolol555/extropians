<i>&gt; &gt; That's a rather interesting idea, but it should be able to work in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; free</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; market as well.  Get a lot of people to pledge a certain amount of money</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for significant life extension.  For twenty years I'd be willing to put</i><br>
<i>&gt; up</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; $10,000.  Now, just get 100,000 people to do this as well and you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have a prize worth one billion.  How many immortalists are there?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<p>
THere is a book just out, I believe called _Longitude_ about the<br>
Englishman who solved the problem of longitudinal navigation.<br>
Apparently, the Parliament put up a big prize to the person who could<br>
solve the problem. He solved it by developing highly accurate clocks and<br>
a system of astronomical and velocity based tables. THis is probably the<br>
most famous and commercially beneficial application of the invention<br>
bounty, though there are currently prizes up for many different<br>
engineering acheivements, and if you remember, Paul MacCready developed<br>
his human powered airplanes in the 80's to win such prizes put up by<br>
private organizations, doing a mile loop, then spanning the English<br>
Channel, and then the course from Crete to Greece that was mythically<br>
taken by Deadalus.<br>
<p>
If you note the progression MacCready took, winning each prize along the<br>
way, this might be a good blueprint to go by, having cash prizes to<br>
individuals or teams that extend human life past 120, 150, 200, and 500<br>
years. Given that the sums will be waiting for that amount of time to<br>
mature, they will be earning a goodly amount of interest while they wait<br>
for those spans to complete.<br>
<p>
As for cryonics, which realistically is by definition NOT life<br>
extension, but suspension, as a corpsicle is not aware, cognizant etc<br>
while under suspension, I would suggest prizes for successfull revival<br>
of various higher mammals as intermediary steps, with human revival as<br>
only the final one. Of course, there will also need to be prizes for<br>
anciallary technologies like nano that will be required for reparation<br>
of corpsicles to full capability.<br>
