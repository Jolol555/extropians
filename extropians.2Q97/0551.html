<i>&gt; &gt;  	A couple of weeks ago, we had the opportunity to thumb through a</i><br>
weekly<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  American magazine called TIME,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ard... how many thumbs do we have?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
	We are not sure.  It appeared to us that you had one at each end of your<br>
food processing tube, but you kept switching them.  We would suggest that<br>
you count all the digits on both hands, subtract the fingers and the result<br>
should be the correct answer, unless your mother had a love affair with<br>
Thalidimide when you were in utero.  Then again, we are not sure you are<br>
humanoid.  But thanks for asking.<br>
