I think part of the problem is her confrontational style, which, as I'm<br>
learning from Barbara Branden's biography of Rand, is no different than<br>
her personality.  Blazing passion for the notion that she is absolutely<br>
right about everything can be annoying.  It can also be inspiring.<br>

Cheers!  I have a homemade sign with the word "evolvEgo" hanging<br>
prominatnly in my apartment. (I added the "evolve" prefix to offset my<br>
dissatisfaction for Rand's inability to acknowledge personal growth and<br>
change, something I've seen a lot of...)<br>

The passage that, for me, embodies much of the beauty of Misss Rand's<br>
sense of life is from "The Fountainhead":<br>
<p>
	"Don't work for my happiness my brothers--<br>
		show me yours--<br>
		show me that it is possible--<br>
		show me your acheivement--<br>
	and the knowledge will give me courage for mine."<br>

<p>
Those words never fail to stir my own passion for the attainment of my<br>
goals.<br>
