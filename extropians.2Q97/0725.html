This is my recollection of the second bet, as recounted both in Simon's<br>
editorial in the Wall Street Journal and some other source I forget.  It is<br>
medium accurate.  <br>
<p>
Simon offered to bet that *any* statistic that measured human welfare would<br>
improve over the next ten years.  Erlich offered to bet on several<br>
statistics, among them the carbon dioxide content of the air, and Brazilian<br>
air pollution rates.  Simon refused to bet on CO2, saying that it was not<br>
clear that the composition of the air was related to human welfare in any<br>
way.  I forget how he got out of the Brazilian air pollution one. <br>
<p>
Frankly, I think Simon made an offer that was far too open.  As far as I can<br>
tell, air pollution is *popular* in Brazil, because the current boom in<br>
industry is making lots of poor people rich, and rich people richer. The<br>
usual historical pattern is that after people have been rich for a while,<br>
they get fed up with bad air and do something about it.  But Erlich is<br>
almost certainly right that it will be worse in ten years than it is now.<br>
There are lots of statistics that Erlich could have picked; he just has to<br>
choose a small enough area, and pick a statistic that measures a problem<br>
produced as a by-product of something that lots of people want.  <br>
