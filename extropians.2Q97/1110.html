In a message dated 97-05-13 11:04:17 EDT, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; I seem to recall that public nudity was unremarkable in western Europe<br>
until <br>
 roughly 1500.  Not that people went around all day in the nude, but it would<br>
<p>
 not be unreasonable to happen upon someone bathing or changing clothes in <br>
 public.  &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
Example:  The "spa" district of Germany, today.  The hotel (not even in the<br>
"spa" area) I stayed at, near Saar, was clothing optional.  The Turkish bath,<br>
spa,  sauna and pool areas were co-ed clothing optional.  I stepped in on six<br>
nude German college women 18-25 years old, in the sauna at the hotel.   My<br>
puritanical meme took over and I left, embarrassed.  But, they paid me<br>
absolutely _no_ notice and just kept on talking to each other.  Later, the<br>
next day, one of the women told me "You Americans are strange.  Can't you<br>
Americans distinguish between nudity and sex?" <br>
