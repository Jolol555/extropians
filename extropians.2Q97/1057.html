<p>
That sound like an good diet, as long as you don't pig out on the cheese.<br>
 I'd probably be in trouble.  This kind of diet would make many people lose<br>
weight and feel good; no need for food combining to explain anything.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to me that the main plausibility about food combining is that</i><br>

<p>
Really, there's no good way to know.  Food in the wild tends not to come in<br>
enormous quantity, although there are exceptions.<br>
