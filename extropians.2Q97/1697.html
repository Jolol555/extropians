You seem to assume that all knowledge would be aquired by simply injecting<br>
pre-existing information into ones "brain."  Sure, I may be able to have<br>
instant access and understanding of quantum mechanics, but to apply that<br>
knowledge to some practicle end would require effort and, IMO, passion as<br>
well.  Think of it like this: The level of common knowledge may increase<br>
exponentially, but discovery is always new.  And the more information you<br>
have access to and understanding of, the more you can contribute to the<br>
expansion of that information base.<br>

Exovivo!<br>
