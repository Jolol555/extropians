<i>	&gt;caused it!?</i><br>
	 <br>
<p>
Nothing caused the first cause, otherwise it wouldn't be the first cause.<br>
	  <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;But nothing you could observe after that initial cause is random.</i><br>
	     <br>
<p>
Why not? If event B has no cause it just means that there does not exist an <br>
event A such that if I see  A I am certain to see B. There is nothing <br>
obviously illogical about that and modern experimental results seem to <br>
confirm the possibility.<br>
		 <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;I would also argue that the initial cause was not random, because I         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;don't believe that random events exist.</i><br>
		   <br>
<p>
If it was not random that means it had a cause so it can't be the initial  <br>
cause. Either some things are random or, if you want to preserve determinism, <br>
there in an infinite chain of cause and effect and no initial cause.<br>

<i>	&gt;As you said "...according to many of the most popular interpretations         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;of Quantum Mechanics nothing is anything until it is perceived".</i><br>
	    <br>
<p>
The Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics may be the most popular <br>
with most but it is not my personal favorite, that doesn't mean it can't be <br>
true but it just seems to me to be passing the buck, it never tells us  <br>
exactly what an observer is or what perception is.  Can anything less than a <br>
human pass for an observer as far as Quantum  Mechanics is concerned, what <br>
about an ape or a dog or a mouse or a bug or a camera or a computer?  <br>
<p>
Everett's interpretation does not have to explain perception because it has <br>
nothing to do with the it, the same is true of John Cramer's Transactional  <br>
Interpretation, or David Bohm's Pilot Wave Interpretation.  <br>
	   <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;Information only exists on something once we percieve it, but it         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;exists 'physically'.  </i><br>
	   <br>
<p>
If the Copenhagen interpretation is correct then information can not exist  <br>
without consciousness and consciousness can not exist without information, <br>
this certainly doesn't lead to your conclusion that only meat can be <br>
conscious.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>	&gt;If you uploaded your consciouness you would no longer be conscious         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;because you would no longer have a physical world on which to         </i><br>
<i>	&gt;accumilate information.  </i><br>
	   <br>
<p>
We accumulate information from our senses, process it with our brain and  <br>
store in into memory, we also take old data from memory, reprocess it, and <br>
return it to memory, an Upload would do exactly the same thing.<br>
	   <br>
<p>
<i>	&gt;As you said, a brain is nothing without senses          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I didn't say it was nothing, just that an intelligence without senses can't <br>
detect time or space.  And anyway, why can't an upload have senses?   <br>
