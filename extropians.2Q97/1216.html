I would probably rate myself as "very knowledgeable" if not expert.  I've<br>
been investing for many years (stocks mostly) and I have two people in my<br>
immediate family who are heavily licensed securities traders.<br>
<p>
<p>

<p>
<p>
What do you mean by "extropian angle"?  <br>
<p>
Investing is a complex issue and strategies vary widely depending on your<br>
goals.  The most common goals are capital growth, tax sheltering, income,<br>
and inflation hedging.<br>
<p>
The technological changes have far less impact on the overall economy than<br>
in their own sectors.  The sum total of all the "high-tech" and supporting<br>
industries account for 4% of the GNP in the US, and even less in other<br>
countries.  Consumer industries have a far greater impact on growth than<br>
technology industries.  <br>
<p>
The most profound economic impacts are usually caused by demographic<br>
shifts, most of which can be predicted ahead of time with careful study.<br>
The unprecedented 1995-96 American stock market surge was predicted by the<br>
research divisions of several large investment firms a decade or two prior<br>
to its actual occurrence.  That surge can attributed almost exclusively to<br>
a large demographic shift.  Incidentally, another important demographic<br>
shift is expected to occur ~5 years from now, but with negative impact on<br>
the US market.<br>
<p>
Technology stocks ( what I personally specialize in ) are a special case of<br>
investment strategies, since the "normal" rules of industrial age investing<br>
need to be somewhat modified to work properly in the information age.  A<br>
lot of people lose money investing in the technology arena because they try<br>
to apply the principles they use on the old school NYSE stocks to the<br>
volatile and uncertain NASDAQ market.  It is difficult to make the fabulous<br>
wealth associated with tech stocks unless you are (1) very knowledgeable<br>
about the technologies you are investing in, or (2) very lucky.  Since I<br>
don't believe in luck, I always depend on the former.  Also, there are<br>
dozens of fad technologies that attract a lot of attention, but are flashes<br>
in the pan and unlikely to generate profits for the investor.  In my<br>
experience, most stock analysts have a very difficult time determining the<br>
difference between tech-fad and tech-value.  Silicon Valley is littered<br>
with the carcasses of highly-funded, highly-touted companies.<br>
<p>
The specifics of a strategy for investing in technology would depend on<br>
your end goals.<br>
