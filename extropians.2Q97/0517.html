Entropy Alert! I object ; - )<br>
First of all-  Money is needed to live with pride, to achieve fame, and to<br>
measure some aspects of success.. as well as being a very good end in itself.<br>
Also - common sense -  no one can DO research without spending a lot of your<br>
own cash, so grants and rewards provide incentive - and to spend a lifetime<br>
doing something, altruistically hoping for "making the world a better place"<br>
is FINE, but I hope it also pays your rent, anyway,  I believe that people<br>
are selfish enough to want life extension for it's own rewards - but<br>
apparently they are'nt motivated YET.<br>
( BTW I mentioned the R.A.W. book in response to an objectivist OBJECTING to<br>
govt. funding for such projects.)<br>
