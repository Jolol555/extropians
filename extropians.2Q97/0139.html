Agreed. <br>

If you can sense the data traffic you can pick up patterns, a bit like <br>
listening to the hard drive of a workstation. That could give you an <br>
impression of what others are thinking/doing ("She is deep into the Net, <br>
with all that traffic. I wonder if her reality is even here... but he is <br>
just bursting a bit, only his agents are online.")<br>

It might feel that, since our ability to interpret the state of other<br>
people is largely subconscious - just think of those pheromones. We have<br>
elaborate limbic systems to deal with this; hur the temporal lobe and you<br>
might loose the ability to recognize faces or (if the amygdala is hurt)<br>
send/receive the wrong dominance-submission signals. And emotional content<br>
of speech seems to be interpeted in the non-dominant temporal lobe. Some<br>
people are bad at communicating socially, and they are seen as<br>
unsympathic, rude, aloof or unempathic despite having normal brains<br>
otherwise. <br>
<p>
It would be interesting to develop limbic enhancements; we tend to think <br>
far too much about improving our cognition without thinking of the need <br>
to improve our social abilities. Enhanced Empathy, anyone? <br>
