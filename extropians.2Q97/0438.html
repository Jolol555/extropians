<i>&gt; &gt;Once a species starts spreading across space, it would tend to</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;strengths in different parts of the growing technosphere. Near the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;edges, rapid growth and colonization would be preferable, ...  At the</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;land of the careful Bayesians. They grow mainly memetically rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than physically</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If these regions could effectively contract with each other, then both</i><br>
<i>&gt; should grow at the same rate in terms of wealth.  Central memetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; investments would compete with edge physical investments, and if there</i><br>
<i>&gt; were more good ones of the later type, then edges would be funded by</i><br>
<i>&gt; central investors, with payoffs flowing from the outside in.</i><br>
<p>
This would depend on the speed of spread and the distances. Setting up <br>
contracts can be hard over lightyear distances, especially since the <br>
growers would have spread a few lightyears while the messages were sent <br>
back and forth. This suggests to me that unless the core beings were <br>
quite patient and accepted that their trading partners would be nearly <br>
core too once the contract was finished, the different regions are <br>
effectively cut off from one another.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If these regions were cut off from one another, then the evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt; arguments would apply to each one seperately.  The arguments I cited</i><br>
<i>&gt; did not depend on the actual local growth rate available, so they</i><br>
<i>&gt; imply that both places would have careful Bayesians.  And evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; should also select for agents which choose to be on the inside or</i><br>
<i>&gt; outside based on expected growth rates in each place.  In a population</i><br>
<i>&gt; dominated by such creatures, it wouldn't be obvious whether to head on</i><br>
<i>&gt; out against great odds and competition, or to be one of the few who</i><br>
<i>&gt; stay home.</i><br>
<p>
Note that I never said the growers would not be careful; wild and daring <br>
explorers seldom become old explorers. The difference would likely be <br>
between the growers, who colonize new space to create hardware, and the <br>
stay homes, who might move in into the new hardware, paying with memes <br>
and knowledge. <br>
