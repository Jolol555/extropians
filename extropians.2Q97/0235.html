<i>&gt;         This list has been a great help in finding and hopefully tomorrow</i><br>
<i>&gt; being able to acquire my first helpings of so called "smart drugs".  Also i</i><br>
<i>&gt; think that the reliabilty of these drugs really isnt in question. </i><br>
<p>
Or course it's in question, or I wouldn't have asked.  I find not<br>
merely insufficient evidence, but /no/ evidence, and not even the<br>
attempt at evidence that they do a damned thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         For DMAE the one I choose to start on there was a simple biological</i><br>
<i>&gt; explaniaton for its effects and simple biological reasons for its</i><br>
<i>&gt; side-effects.  Along the line these supplements and nootropics have to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; passed by the FDA for approval as OTC, supplemental, and prescription</i><br>
<i>&gt; availability and they must establish necessary guidelines for dosing and</i><br>
<i>&gt; prescribing and probably even establish its LD50 dosage.  so these</i><br>
<i>&gt; supplements and drugs aren't totally unresearched. </i><br>
<p>
Huh?  That's precisely what I'm talking about--there are reams of<br>
paragraphs like that one.  Lots of buzzwords, zero information content.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         as for their claimed effects to the mental process, it doesnt really</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter to me. If my body can be fooled into a higher ability to concentrate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; better mood and extends my life span then i dont really care if more</i><br>
<i>&gt; acetlycholine has penetrated the blood-brain barrier, its not really the</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue, the results are.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                              langlois@postoffice.ptd.net</i><br>
<p>
Precisely!  I agree.  I don't care /why/ they work either, I just<br>
want to know /if/ they work, and all I can find is explanations and<br>
testimonials.  I don't give a damn what gets transmitted where, or<br>
why we think it might work, or how the people using them feel or what<br>
they believe.  None of that matters.  Do they work or not?  A simple<br>
question, easy to answer, with methods known for centuries.  The fact<br>
that no one even tries to answer it is very suspicious.  I'm happy<br>
that you feel better or think you concentrate more with them, but if<br>
I see no reason to believe that those aren't just placebo effects,<br>
then I'm not going to blindly pop pills on some random testimonial.<br>
