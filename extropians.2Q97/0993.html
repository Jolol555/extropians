<i>&gt; &gt; I don't agree that Extropians do not believe in coercion. They may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; believe in corecion by the State, but how do they propose to effect even</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contractual law without any form of enforcement?</i><br>
<i>&gt;         From the strict definition of the word, coercion, Extropians use coercion</i><br>
<i>&gt; as well as anyone else.  Exploiting anothers' fear is coercion; fear of</i><br>
<i>&gt; being ostracized is but one way they coerce others to "fall in line".</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, it might be more accurate to say they do not believe in initiating</i><br>
<i>&gt; force.  Enforcement of laws under an Extro-Society would not violate this</i><br>
<i>&gt; principle since all laws would have victims.  The offender would then be</i><br>
<i>&gt; the initiator of force and the victim, having a contract with an</i><br>
<i>&gt; enforcement agency (private of course), would have the right to respond</i><br>
<i>&gt; through this agent of theirs.  That, is how they would enforce their</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights.  Writing about rights, we believe there is only one right...the</i><br>
<i>&gt; right to life.   Rights to property, health, and liberty all derive from</i><br>
<i>&gt; this single right.  If another can control our property (taxes, etc.) they</i><br>
<i>&gt; can deprive us of life, the same for health and liberty.  To interfere with</i><br>
<i>&gt; anothers' life would be the only crime.  And certainly we all recognize the</i><br>
<i>&gt; right to use force, if necessary to prevent someone from killing us, no</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter how slowly they are doing it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                                         ard</i><br>
What about coercion of people to fulfill the contracts they have<br>
committed to? One possibility is currently in use in the construction<br>
industry. It is called the bond. Its kind of like placing a bet that you<br>
are going to do what you say you are going to do. This is why you should<br>
only deal with contractors that are bonded, as well as insured.<br>
