     Then Robin Hanson replied:<br>
     An analogy is the transition from nomadic herding to farming.  Farming<br>
     was a worse life style by most accounts -- including worse food and<br>
     harder labor.  But it was a vastly larger economic niche, and most of<br>
     us are descended from people who filled it. =20<br>
     <br>
     And I comment:<br>
     So history (or a cultural trend) should repeat itself?  No thanks.  <br>
     There is already pressure on humans to multi-task and process faster.  <br>
     I heard once (from Dustin Hoffman on Larry King Live: take it for what <br>
     it's worth but it's an interesting notion) We process more info in a <br>
     day than most pre-WWII Eastern Europeans did in their lives.<br>
     <br>
     I crave information but it is sometimes exhaustive.  What we need are <br>
     a) technological intelligent agents to be our major domos for <br>
     retrieving information.<br>
     b) physiological improvements (thru nutrition? training? drugs? shock <br>
     treatment? &lt;G&gt;) that facilitate better brain processing.<br>
     c) better organization of the information.  It's a haystack out there <br>
     and the needle of my focused attention is going to take a while to <br>
     find until someone invents needle locators.  <br>
     <br>
     BTW, the herding--&gt;farming analogy is great.  However, for an <br>
     interesting slant on that (ecological/anthropological/sociological) <br>
     have a look at the book "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn or some of the <br>
     futurist/archetypal studies by Joseph Campbell or Jean Houston.  Also, <br>
     "A Brief History of Everything" by Ken Wilber.<br>
     <br>
     The beginning of agriculture is the beginning of great things and <br>
     not-so-great things.  Agriculture ultimately gave us time to ponder <br>
     the universe once we had stockpiled enough.  Of course, the first <br>
     banks were created to safeguard grain supplies.  On the down side, <br>
     hording, imbalance and exploitation were agricultural byproducts that <br>
     have had quite a negative impact on civilization as well.  The <br>
     "dominator" culture as it is referred to by Quinn.  Archetypally, Cain <br>
     (the farmer) slew Able (the herder) so there's a long-term association <br>
     of agriculture with violence/exploitation/dominance.  <br>
