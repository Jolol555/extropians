Wow, I'm surprised this didn't make it to the news.  There's been discussion<br>
over whether GRB are local or extragalatic events (extragalatic having had<br>
the preference) and this seems pretty good proof that they are extragalactic<br>
and really big and nasty too.  It's been suspected that they were collapsing<br>
binary neutron stars or something like that and this is evidence to back that<br>
up.  I don't want to trivialize what's on the news, but the existence of true<br>
monsters like that is big news.<br>
<p>
Just think - there could be one about to happen right next door and we<br>
wouldn't even know ...<br>
