<i>&gt; &gt; I would very much appreciate getting a better understanding of how</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; libertarian thought can be meshed with the idea of public property.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Easy; the public who want to 'protect' the land create a corporation which</i><br>
<i>&gt; buys it and holds it for them. This already happens in some countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; (e.g. the 'National Trust' in the UK which owns a lot of land and old</i><br>
<i>&gt; buildings). Of course the Green objection to this would be that they're</i><br>
<i>&gt; not into materialistic goals like making money, so they wouldn't be able</i><br>
<i>&gt; to afford to buy it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, some of the British Greens have used this tactic in the past to</i><br>
<i>&gt; prevent development of woodlands; they bought the land and split it into</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of plots which they sold off to individuals for a few pounds</i><br>
<i>&gt; each. Then when the government wanted to buy the land to build on they had</i><br>
<i>&gt; to at least try to hunt down every one of those people to buy up their</i><br>
<i>&gt; little plot of land. AFAIK it delayed them for quite a while and was</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably at least as effective as their more confrontational tactics.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Almost every state has an organization that operates as a land trust.<br>
THey prosthelytize with land owners to add covenants to their deeds<br>
agreeing that so much property will be permanently barred from<br>
development. In return, they often get much lower property tax rates<br>
(which here in NH means big bucks). The property typically stays in the<br>
hands of the owners, so environmentalists do not have to go around<br>
buying property.<br>
This is not a new thing. THis is also done with rain forests in Brazil,<br>
Costa Rica, Chile and Peru. Kind of makes environmentalists put their<br>
money where their mouth is.<br>
