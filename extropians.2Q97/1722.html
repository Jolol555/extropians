<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; (I prefer to call it spiritual stuff)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Why do you prefer this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Thank you for asking.  I hope you don't mind if I reply to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this publicly since I would love to have much more discussion about</i><br>
<i>&gt; this topic.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	There are many reason.  First and foremost it seems to me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be the most natural.</i><br>
<p>
Naturalness is relative.  I suspect that to most people "spiritual"<br>
is not a natural description of the internal representations created<br>
by the mind.  Rather, they associate it with religion and mysticism.<br>
It is a completely misleading use of the word for most people.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This is a vast "cartoon world" inside our mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is everything we know.  At the center of this "cartoon world" is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a representation of ourselves.  It is isomorphically very identical to</i><br>
<i>&gt; our real physical selves and mirrors our physical selves via data</i><br>
<i>&gt; collected by our senses.  Calling this our spiritual selves certainly</i><br>
<i>&gt; sounds much better than calling it a "cartoon" rendition of ourselves.</i><br>
<p>
Why not just call it an internal representation?  That's the phrase you<br>
resorted to when you wanted people to understand you.  Use the terms<br>
which promote understanding, not confusion.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Further, scientists and philosophers have been avoiding this</i><br>
<i>&gt; "S" word for years now.  I ask why?  This is what has caused the great</i><br>
<i>&gt; divide between scientific thinking and religious thinking.  To me, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most important goal of science today is to discover what this</i><br>
<i>&gt; substance of ideas is.  What is consciousness made of?  I believe we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are about to discover precisely what this mirracusouls phenomenal</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff is as Crick argues in his book: "The Astonishing Hypothesis".</i><br>
<i>&gt; This will be the most significant discovery made to date by man.  This</i><br>
<i>&gt; discovery is what will make uploading possible.  For me, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; precisely the discovery of the spiritual.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not familiar with Crick's book, but I can't imagine that any<br>
scientific explanation of consciousness will make uploading possible in<br>
itself.  The hard problem is and will remain getting specific information,<br>
at the neural level, about the internal workings of the brains that we<br>
want to upload, and having computers big enough to accurately model them.<br>
It should be possible to create uploads without having any scientific<br>
understanding of consciousness per se.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Realizing that this spirit world exists inside our mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; rationally explains all the "spiritual" phenomenon religious people</i><br>
<i>&gt; claim proves we have a spirit.  Of course it is possible for our</i><br>
<i>&gt; spiritual selves to have an out of body experience in this cartoon</i><br>
<i>&gt; world.</i><br>
<p>
Not in the sense people think of it, where the out of body experience<br>
represents an actual interaction with remote parts of the real<br>
world.  Here is where your terminology is confusing.  There are<br>
two interpretations of an OOB experience.  One is that it happens<br>
strictly within your brain, a simulation of what it would be like if<br>
you could go out and interact with the world mentally; the other is that<br>
something actually leaves your body (as the name implies) and goes out<br>
and interacts with the real world.  You, who are trying to draw a sharp<br>
distinction between our internal representations and what is "out there",<br>
should be the most aware of this.  If someone in the next room puts a<br>
randomly chosen playing card on the table, and I visit that room in an<br>
OOB experience, can I expect to come back and say what that card is?<br>
The two explanations provide exactly opposite predictions about the<br>
outcome.  Which do you accept?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course there is phantom limb pain after an amputation.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the spiritual self in our brain which hasn't had it's spirit limb</i><br>
<i>&gt; amputated feeling the phantom pain.  This is real stuff that really</i><br>
<i>&gt; exists just as our physical body exists.  We must call it something.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What is more natural than calling it the spiritual self inside the</i><br>
<i>&gt; spiritual world inside our brain?</i><br>
<p>
It is more natural to call it the brain's representation of the state<br>
of its body.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Anything is possible in this dream world and that is why so</i><br>
<i>&gt; many people have so many experiences that they think are "spiritually</i><br>
<i>&gt; supper natural".  They are spiritual but they are not supper natural.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If people realized that all this was simply occuring in the natural</i><br>
<i>&gt; fantasy spirit world inside our brain and not beyond our brain people</i><br>
<i>&gt; could more rationally think about and understand the significance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; all such occurrences.</i><br>
<p>
Surely you are aware that for hundreds of years people have been arguing<br>
about whether such experiences are all in the heads of the people having<br>
them, or represent actual interactions with the outside world!  Your<br>
terminology sheds no new light on this debate.  Do you think people will<br>
now accept that their experiences are all in their heads simply because<br>
you have labelled them "spiritual"?  It is far more likely that they will<br>
tell you that you have misunderstood the nature of what they are<br>
experiencing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Also, most people reject the notion of abstract uploading</i><br>
<i>&gt; because deep down they know there is something spiritual inside of us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What an abstract machine uses to represent red is very different than</i><br>
<i>&gt; what we use to represent red.  True, we will be able to make an</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstract copy of ourselves that has no spirit at all, but this is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; uploading.  It is only abstract simulation.  There is no feeling</i><br>
<i>&gt; involved.  Such would be a zombie that would be lying when it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; trying to describe what the color blue is really like since none of</i><br>
<i>&gt; what it knew would be represented with real blue.</i><br>
<p>
I don't believe in zombies.  The idea that someone can behave just like<br>
a human being, argue passionately that he *is* conscious, that he does<br>
have internal experiences, that he loves life and treasures every moment<br>
of his existence, while actually (I guess) lying about this, is incoherent.<br>
You ought to read some of the philosophical arguments against the existence<br>
of zombies.  David Chalmers has some good stuff on his web page.  (I don't<br>
agree with Chalmers on some issues, but his arguments against zombies are<br>
good.)<br>
<p>
One example is Chalmer's "fading qualia", from<br>
<a href="http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/papers/qualia.html">http://ling.ucsc.edu/~chalmers/papers/qualia.html</a>.  Imagine your brain<br>
gradually being replaced, a bit at a time, with electronic circuitry which<br>
mimics the neural functions.  Zombie lovers might suggest that at the end<br>
you have no consciousness, although you continue to act just the same.<br>
Now imagine what it would feel like to undergo this transformation.<br>
Presumably at some point you have a "faded" sense of consciousness;<br>
you are part way to being a zombie, but not all the way there.  Yet you<br>
continue to act just the same, and claim that the intensity of your<br>
sense of self has not changed at all.  How can you rationalize this<br>
inaccuracy?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	These are my thoughs on this subject, what do you think?  Do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you fear or wince at the idea of calling it "spiritual" stuff?  If so</i><br>
<i>&gt; then why?</i><br>
<p>
I just think it's confusing.  You are taking a term with an established<br>
set of meanings and using it in a different way.  This will not further<br>
the cause of enlightened discussion.<br>
<p>
I should add that I am tired of people claiming that we fear or react<br>
defensively to these terms.  That's just an attempt to argue by<br>
intimidation, and I find it rude.<br>
