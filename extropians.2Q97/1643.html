<i>&gt;  &gt; This is one of the things that I never understand about uploading,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; what advantage does it offer?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The advantage that it offers is that possibly your new platform</i><br>
<i>&gt; won't have a designed-in mean time between failures of less than 120</i><br>
<i>&gt; years.</i><br>
<p>
	And the ability to spontaneously install things like doctorate<br>
degrees and/or life time memories such as practicing the piano for a<br>
life time or studying math for a life time...  And the ability to<br>
spontaneously do things like change habits or rewire temptations,<br>
(i.e. get the joy from NOT eating that extra unneeded piece of cheese<br>
cake rather than only getting the joy from eating it).  And the<br>
ability to eff feelings (i.e. experience all the sexual feelings<br>
between two partners, not just half of them.)  And the ability to<br>
experience things you never experienced before (i.e. what is it like<br>
to be a bat)...  and the ability to install upgradeds new/improved<br>
intelligence technology abilities as they become available... and on<br>
and on and on without limit until one is finally God.  Even if one<br>
makes his brain immortal, you can't get very far if you limit yourself<br>
to the current brain you have can you?<br>
<p>
	By the way, this is my first post to this list.  I only have a<br>
BS in CS from the University of Utah and work as a Software Engineer<br>
for HP but I'm also %100 extropian!<br>
