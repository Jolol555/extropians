<i>&gt; The monitor quoted Albert Einstein as referring to a God, indicating</i><br>
<i>&gt; that he had a belief in God but detested the Judeo-Christian God.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; hear the quote that Einstein said that God did not throw dice in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; creation of the universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Heisenberg was referred to as having a belief in a unifying principle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Could someone comment on the above and give the scientific viewpoint on</i><br>
<i>&gt; God, a metaphysical soul etc.</i><br>
<p>
God is used as a label for the experience of X.<br>
<p>
In my (limited) experience, X is either felt as something outside onself<br>
and bigger than oneself, or it is yourself, or unity (all is one etc.).<br>
<p>
Both can be described as God, or not. God seems to be a good metaphor,<br>
or label, or personification, for some outer or inner<br>
intelligence/power/&amp;c.<br>
<p>
Quantum physicists can talk about nonlocal Information Systems, or Hidden<br>
Variables within the science game but it is clear that these concepts<br>
could equally be labelled God, or divine.<br>
<p>
Fritjof Capra, like Einstein, doesn't seem to like the Judeo-Christian God<br>
but he found quantum physics and Eastern Mysticism to be VERY compatible,<br>
especially the unity and oneness aspects.<br>
<p>
For me, at the moment, God is just Nick Herbert's Cosmic Glue that must<br>
exist is Bell' Theorem is valid. Or God is really just me, the higher<br>
circuits in my own primate brain.<br>
