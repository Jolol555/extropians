Don't you think the discussion of Cartesian doubt, combinatorial<br>
explosion, hallucinations, dreams and stuff in the intro rings*extremely<br>
* true? About how the brain seems to throw out possible meanings, and<br>
will try and interpret even a bit of noise to carry *some* sort of signal,<br>
and how that's the likely explanation of dreams and hallucinations?<br>
<p>
It particularly rings true for me if I ever get any hallucinations<br>
nowadays:- I feel I can catch the mechanicalness of it in action now,<br>
it's just me throwing out possible identifications of things, visual,<br>
linguistic, aural, mental, associational meanings, significances:-   <br>
<p>
"I thought I saw a banker's clerk descending from a bus, I looked again <br>
and saw it was a hippopotamus." (a Crowley skit) <br>
<p>
or<br>
<p>
"Did he just say what I thought he said? " (at a party, say)<br>
<p>
for example.<br>
<p>
And *none* of it is *necessarily* to be taken seriously just because it <br>
*feels* seriously like it's the real meaning of the situation at the<br>
time, and your critical faculty happens to be relaxed.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, none of it is necessarily *not* to be taken seriously,<br>
and must be judged also when sober (as apparently the Vikings would do -<br>
judge everything twice, once drunk, once sober); and may indeed be judged<br>
true, and may in fact be true.<br>
