Warning: this was the old method of treating diabetes, and was abandoned<br>
(about 40 years ago, I think) for the current method (mostly complex<br>
carbohydrate) when studies showed diabetic on the (then) new carb diet did<br>
better than on those on low-carb diets.  Of course, perhaps the new low-carbs<br>
methods are substantively different than the old ones.<br>

<p>
This will have profound effects on your metabolism.  Below about 30 gms/day<br>
your body cannot maintain the normal areobic chemistry cycle.  It switches to<br>
another based on directly burning fat metabolites (this apparently normally<br>
serves as a starvation metabolism).  This state is called ketosis, from the<br>
ketones of fat metabolites that start floating about your bloodstream.<br>
 Ketosis can make you drop weight like crazy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Later you raise your carb level to 40% of the</i><br>

<p>
Again, a little caution here; in a high-protein diet most of the protein is<br>
burnt for energy and the kidneys have to dispose of the nitrogenous wastes.<br>
 Over a lifetime this appears to accelerate the natural decline of the<br>
kidneys.  Kidneys are a bad thing to have trouble with as they tend not to<br>
recover well; by the time you have symptoms you'd already be irreversably<br>
quite ill.<br>
<p>
However, I don't think this diet is greatly different from the current<br>
standard american diet.  <br>
