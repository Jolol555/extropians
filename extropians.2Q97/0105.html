<p>
I'm not sure of the 'official' definition of the word, and few of the<br>
people I've asked seem to have any idea either. To me ego is the<br>
difference between a person's perception of themselves and their real<br>
state. This is why it holds people back; you can't act sensibly if you<br>
don't know who you are. As we were discussing in another recent thread,<br>
many people seem happy to just talk about doing things rather than <br>
actually do them (which is hard work and involves a risk of failure).<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 	Is it possible for an individual to see their life the same way any </i><br>
<i>&gt; other</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual sees their own life?</i><br>
<p>
Yes. It just takes effort to eliminate the ego nonsense and see yourself <br>
as you truly are.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 	What prevents you from "reprograming" yourself now?</i><br>
<p>
I think the biggest problem with reprogramming is that people first have<br>
to accept that they are programmed entities. Our mythology tells us that<br>
we aren't, and you have to break through that programming before you can<br>
start on anything else. I've tried explaining this to some of my friends<br>
and even the neurophysiological evidence doesn't convince them. They<br>
usually try to change the subject to avoid having to even consider that<br>
they might be 'just' computers. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Would you consider having a self-activated joy-button connected to your</i><br>
<i>&gt; "feels good" section of the brain?</i><br>
<p>
Everyone has a self-activated joy-button connected to the "feels good" <br>
section of the brain. Most people just haven't worked out how to activate<br>
it yet except through interactions with other people ('love', etc). Again<br>
it's just a matter of programming.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 	Have you ever experienced 100% Bliss?  Can people experience this </i><br>
<i>&gt; state at</i><br>
<i>&gt; will?  Can they go from Bliss to rationality at will?</i><br>
<p>
Close to 100%, maybe and yes. Utter bliss is fun, but it gets dull after a <br>
while, at least for me. <br>
