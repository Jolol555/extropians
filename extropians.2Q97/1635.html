<p>
You're right, there are two questions: why haven't people tried very<br>
hard so far, and is it worth trying now.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"We don't know how long it takes"?  Perhaps, but I think believing an</i><br>
<i>&gt;agressive species could be noticeably domesticated in less than 10</i><br>
<i>&gt;generations is like John Clark's claim that godhood will be feasible</i><br>
<i>&gt;seconds after the first nano-assembler.  And 10 generations for an ape</i><br>
<i>&gt;is the better part of a century.  And I suspect it would take more</i><br>
<i>&gt;generations...  you need to be improving docility and immunity and</i><br>
<i>&gt;utility simultaneously.  You might be able to get a few docile animals</i><br>
<i>&gt;quickly, but the gene pool will be small.  If you try to get a pool of</i><br>
<i>&gt;animals who don't get sick too easily outside of their natural</i><br>
<i>&gt;environment, you're spending a lot of time on agressive, non-useful</i><br>
<i>&gt;(low-return) animals.  I don't buy it.</i><br>
<p>
I started this whole thread by describing existing lab monkeys, who<br>
are smart enough, less threatening than wild monkeys, and don't get<br>
sick that easily.  We are already part of the way there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Why should an AI be hard to "domesticate"?  There are evolutionary</i><br>
<i>&gt;reasons for lots of the factors behind an animal being too vicious or</i><br>
<i>&gt;panicky or territorial; there'd be no reason for AIs to have these</i><br>
<i>&gt;traits.  I think a major predator of chimps is other chimps, as with</i><br>
<i>&gt;humans; AIs won't have evolved any defensive or offensive strategies.</i><br>
<p>
We don't know what sort of evolutionary environment will be successful<br>
in producing AIs.  I do hope you're right that a non-competitive<br>
environment will be sufficient, but we don't know.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;AI has a long road, but seems able to move very quickly.  At least</i><br>
<i>&gt;once it finds the road.</i><br>
<p>
What indications do we have that AI can move quickly?  I admit its a<br>
logical possibility, but beyond that what do we know?<br>
