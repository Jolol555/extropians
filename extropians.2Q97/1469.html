Yes, as a matter of fact I do have a small bit of insight on this, from<br>
one of my earlier careers -- to wit, in the SETI (Search for<br>
Extraterrestrial Intelligence) field, which has traditionally had <br>
similar<br>
sorts of problems getting academic credibility and funding.  <br>
Fortunately,<br>
SETI found its "eccentric millionnaire" in the person of the late <br>
Barney<br>
Oliver (whose views I disagreed with professionally, but that is <br>
another<br>
story).<br>
<p>
I don't know where to find a neuroprosthetic Sugar Daddy.  However, one<br>
trick I found useful in pursuing my observational research was to<br>
structure the proposal in such a way that an apparently normal,<br>
conservative, academically "respectable" end was stated as the <br>
principal<br>
objective of the research.  You could then mention, almost as an<br>
afterthought, your true objective (phrased in the dullest, most <br>
unexciting<br>
phraseology possible) -- or not, depending on your audience.  <br>
<p>
One specific example I recall<br>
was when a colleague and I wanted to use a large (e.g. ~48" optical)<br>
telescope at a major national observatory to search for possible <br>
orbiting<br>
artifacts of possible alien manufacture near the Earth-Moon Lagrangian<br>
points.  In our proposal, we made NO mention of alien objects -- we<br>
stated that we would be searching for Earth-orbiting asteroids, a<br>
perfectly "legitimate" (even academically kind of "sexy") objective.  <br>
Had<br>
there been any orbiting asteroids (or orbiting alien space probes) we<br>
would have found them, so the research had two absolutely legitimate<br>
objectives, one stated for the record, the other not.  Our proposal<br>
succeeded -- we got the observing time we asked for, and got a nice<br>
little technical paper out of it.<br>
<p>
Whether or not this same technique can or should be applied to<br>
neurotechnology is your call, not mine.  If you're trying to finagle an <br>
<p>
entire laboratory you'll have to be a LOT more clever!  I'm just <br>
telling<br>
you what once worked for me, in a much more modest arena.<br>
