<p>
EJCBS CALL FOR PAPERS<br>
<p>
     We are announcing the EJCBS (The Electronic Journal<br>
of Cognitive and Brain Sciences) as an experimental journal<br>
which is published in an electronic form on the<br>
World Wide Web (WWW). Submission, acceptance and publication<br>
are automated. The journal is moderated by the whole scientific<br>
community. It requires no editorial supervision.  EJCBS is<br>
dedicated to publishing experimental, theoretical reports,<br>
review papers, joint commentaries, degree Ph.D. theses and<br>
preliminary works before they are submitted to other journals.<br>
Beyond the characteristics of the traditional printed journals,<br>
and in contrast with the characteristics of other electronic<br>
journals, EJCBS has certain new features which may attract<br>
scientist and thinkers to challenge their works.<br>
<p>
Some of these features are:<br>
<p>
-Self-editing<br>
-Supports graphical representation (insertion of figures,<br>
 images, charts, mathematical formulas)<br>
-Two stages of acceptance<br>
-Final acceptance based on an on-line poll of the readers<br>
-Open for reviews and commentaries, with on line links to<br>
 encourage discussion, and communication of ideas.<br>
<p>
This type of publishing has never before been tested.  Since<br>
the system is open for public review and examination it<br>
facilitates discussion among professionals.  The quality of<br>
the journal is guaranteed by setting a high threshold for<br>
acceptance. Acceptance of submitted material is judged by our<br>
on-line poll.  The readers evaluation, or on-line poll has<br>
been designed to focus on the standards of the hypothesis<br>
testing, theoretical relevance and methodological adequacy.<br>
<p>
Submission is easy!  An interactive protocol for submission<br>
instantly links the submitted article into the first stage<br>
of review.  The journal should be aesthetically pleasing.<br>
Formatting styles and figure placement can be manipulated<br>
until a final form is accepted by the author.  Once a document<br>
has been submitted and accepted, it becomes permanently<br>
available in the archive.  The authors are eligible to<br>
republish their papers in other journals. Thus, EJCBS may<br>
provide a useful domain to crystallize the content of any<br>
scientific paper before it is submitted to other journals.<br>
<p>
Free Access!  Access to EJCBS is free.  Materials may be<br>
examined and downloaded for personal or public use.  However,<br>
the submitted papers are still protected by copyright law<br>
and referencing to materials obtained from the EJCBS<br>
requires correct citation of the author and journal.<br>
