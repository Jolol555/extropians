          Here is a curious fact: Eunuchs live on average 13.5 years <br>
          longer than other men! This suggests the most powerful life <br>
          extension technique available to date, at least for half of <br>
          us...<br>
          <br>
          Does anybody know whether this effect is wholly due to the <br>
          reduced levels of activity and stress in eunuchs, or is <br>
          there also a more direct influence from the modified hormone <br>
          balance that is not behaviourally mediated. If there is, <br>
          might this effect be somehow reproduced without the adverse <br>
          effects of castration?<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          On a different note, I have just launched a new web site <br>
          which is intended to accomodate work-in-progress and <br>
          finished papers on transhumanism and analytic philosophy <br>
          etc. <br>

          Of special interest to readers of this list may be the <br>
          sections about the Fermi Paradox, Superintelligence and <br>
          Social attractions in "Predictions from Philosophy" and also <br>
          the document named "Transhumanist Thoughts". A big paper on <br>
          the Carter-Leslie Doomsday argument is forthcomming.<br>
