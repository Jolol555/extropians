      I would not be terribly surprised if economically feasible <br>
     semiconductor technology were to bog down after one or two more chip <br>
     generations.  The maximum speed of a Pentium might be 500 MHz for <br>
     decades, until someone develops a breakthrough technology.<br>

     <br>
     I read recently that electron lasers were able to etch much finer into <br>
     silicon which potentially blasted the roof off the impending ceiling <br>
     of semi-conductor processing speed. (Intel was talking about the <br>
     extraordinary MIPS potential of it's P7 processor three years ago long <br>
     before this electron laser technology came about.  Anyone know about <br>
     their progress?)<br>
     <br>
     Also, silicon may just be a material that's reached the end of its <br>
     usefulness or may need fortification by other materials.  Cars used to <br>
     be all metal, no fiberglass or molded plastic, no aluminum.  Lighter <br>
     materials have certainly contributed to better mileage and sleaker <br>
     more aerodynamic vehicles as well.  While this may be a paltry <br>
     metaphor, all one need do is determine the next semiconductive <br>
     material base.<br>
