<i>&gt; From: Langlois &lt;langlois@postoffice.ptd.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: A new topic to persue</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am currently writing a paper for a sociology class about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; ethics of Transhumanism.  It deals with the ethics of defying</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution to raise ourselves.  In essence its about Whether we can</i><br>
<i>&gt; play god with technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am very interested in what everyone has to say on the topic, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone has been storing pithy one-liners for a theological</i><br>
<i>&gt; vs. technological argument now would be the time to use them.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; grader of this paper is very conservitive bordering on creationism</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I am going to have to go a long way to make my case.</i><br>
<p>
    "Thou art God," Mike repeated serenely. "That which groks. Anne is<br>
    God. I am God. The happy grass are God. Jill groks in beauty<br>
    always. Jill is God. All shaping and making and creating together --"<br>
    He croaked something in Martian and smiled.<br>
<p>
		--Robert A. Heinlein, "Stranger in a Strange Land"<br>
<p>
"Evolution" is a cold physical process. You can't "defy" it any more<br>
than you can "defy" the wind, or the rain. It doesn't care whether you<br>
are "ignoring" it or not.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, there is no god, or gods. We are sentient creatures in a<br>
universe that "just is". There is no creator out there wearing a long<br>
beard to care about our acts. The only creatures that care about our<br>
actions are ourselves. The only morality or ethics that exists is the<br>
one we impose upon ourselves. The universe doesn't care about our<br>
acts.<br>
<p>
No great golden tablets exist saying "thou shalt not do X". You are<br>
free to murder, to steal, to love, to grow pretty flowers in your back<br>
yard. Other humans may disapprove of your actions enough to<br>
try to stop you from pursuing them, or approve of them sufficiently to<br>
laud you for them. You may find that setting off dynamite in close<br>
proximity to your body causes you to cease to function as an intact<br>
human organism. However, the disapproval or approval of humans, or the<br>
tendency of the universe to mechanistically kill organisms that<br>
perform certain acts, does not imply an absolute morality of any<br>
sort. It is not "good" or "bad" to set of dynamite near you, or to<br>
grow flowers.<br>
<p>
All we can objectively say about an action is that it furthers one's<br>
personal goals or hinders them. In this sense, to a suicidal<br>
psychopathic axe-murderer, it is reasonably in furtherance of one's<br>
goals to go about striking people in the head with axes in the hope<br>
that one day someone will kill you. In this same sense, to a<br>
self-preserving person, locking the suicidal axe murderer in a cage is<br>
an act that reasonably furthers one's personal goal of survival.<br>
<p>
Goals are arational -- they are beyond the realm of rationality or<br>
irrationality. It is no more rational to favor survival than not to do<br>
so, any more than it is more "rational" to prefer vanilla ice cream<br>
over chocolate ice cream. Chacun a son gout.<br>
<p>
It is true that evolution tends to lead to a preponderance of those<br>
who value survival as a goal, of course. I, for one, favor my personal<br>
survival, and most people I know do, too. Given that most people who<br>
you will meet are in favor of their own personal survival, if one of<br>
your goals is also survival we may prescribe a set of behavioral rules<br>
of thumb, which we will term "ethics" or "morals", that will improve<br>
your chances of meeting your goals in this environment.<br>
<p>
Do not, however, mistake this for a claim to an absolute definition of<br>
"right" and "wrong". Such beasts don't exist. One can only say<br>
something is "right" or "wrong" *to* some sentient creature.<br>
<p>
Therefore, to answer the question "is it 'right' to play 'god'", we must<br>
ask "what are our goals?"<br>
<p>
A number of years ago, I was trying to explain to someone what the<br>
Extropian world/goal was. I finally came up with a reasonably succinct<br>
two word summary. "Personal apotheosis".<br>
<p>
Extropians are those who possess personal goals that include life<br>
without bounds or limits to the greatest extent possible. No longer<br>
living in foolish fear of the gods who do not exist, the Extropian<br>
wishes to possess powers previously ascribed to the gods of the<br>
superstitious. We desire unlimited lifespan and the capacity to do<br>
whatever it is that we desire that does not conflict with the laws of<br>
physics. In short, we ask for "freedom, immortality, and the stars",<br>
i.e. "personal apotheosis", to oneself become a "god".<br>
<p>
In this context, the question of "tampering with nature" becomes an<br>
obvious benefit, and thus not merely "moral" within the context of<br>
one's personal moral code (the only kind there is!) but actually<br>
laudable. If the tampering furthers our goals, to the extent that we<br>
may manage to do so without being prevented by others, we should do so.<br>
<p>
Now, we may answer your original question.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am very interested in what everyone has to say on the topic, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone has been storing pithy one-liners for a theological</i><br>
<i>&gt; vs. technological argument now would be the time to use them.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; grader of this paper is very conservitive bordering on creationism</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I am going to have to go a long way to make my case.</i><br>
<p>
So, to answer your implicit question of "what do I say in this paper",<br>
we must first establish your goals. Is your goal to enjoy free speech,<br>
or is it to get a good grade?<br>
<p>
If your goal is to get a good grade, the obvious optimal strategy is<br>
not to challenge the beliefs of the highly prejudiced and entropic<br>
person grading the paper, since you are unlikely to convince a<br>
superstitious fool of the correctness of your world view given that<br>
they live in an entirely alien mind set that, among other things,<br>
believes in "gods". In that case, you are better off trying to be as<br>
non-committal as possible, or perhaps (on the outside) to show that<br>
"tampering with nature" is somehow "permitted" [gag!] by the<br>
superstitious fool's world view.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, if you don't care about the grade, and your goal is<br>
to have fun by shocking them, by all means have fun. Mess with their<br>
mind. Shock 'em.<br>
<p>
Its all just a question of selecting the strategy that furthers your<br>
goals the best.<br>
