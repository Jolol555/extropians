<i>        &gt;But this is absurd if you think about it.                   </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
You're being much too serious, Dennett was just having some fun and engaging  <br>
in a little wordplay, like saying "you don't think, you just thing you think".  <br>
If it seems to you that you have qualia then obviously you do. <br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;unlike theories of intelligence, consciousness theories are very        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;easy to dream up, far, far too easy. These theories have no        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;objective facts they must explain so there is no limit to the number        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;of them you  can crank out. How could we ever know which theory is       </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;correct?</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We'll we can't know that anyone really went to the moon either.[...]         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;What matters is people can go to the moon, do things like ger rocks         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and resources and everything else as if it really existed. Of course,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;even though it isn't correct, we must take the simplest theory.</i><br>
         <br>
<p>
The "moon theory" explains lots of things, things, like RADAR reflected off <br>
its surface, the tides, the chemical analysis of rocks, and photons entering  <br>
our eye. The only thing the "conscious minds other than me" theory explains  <br>
is behavior, if as you say it can't even do that then it's useless and <br>
logically I'd have to take solipsism very seriously.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I don't care if I really didn't go to the moon as long as I will         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;never be able to tell that I didn't.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree, and it's why I don't take solipsism very seriously.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;eventually there must be an entire set of physics developed to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;describe all our spiritual, or phenomenal sensations down to the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;most precise possible experiential detail.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If you keep asking a sequence of "why" questions, before very many steps you  <br>
will come to a ontological primitive that no theory can answer, such as, <br>
"Why is there something rather than nothing?" or "Why does intelligence <br>
produce  consciousness?". The only answer is that's just the way the Universe <br>
is.      <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;I think the idea of intelligent zombies is crazy</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;No!  We have zombies today.  A color sensing computer can tell us         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;what color something is far better than we can!  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I said INTELLIGENT zombies. I have to see an intelligent computer, color  <br>
sensing or not, when I do I will conclude it's conscious.<br>
         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But this  [The Genetic Code]  still does not tell us precisely the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;nature of our conscious representations and what they are         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;fundamentally like.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, but it does tell me that the basic architecture of my consciousness was <br>
grown from a DIGITAL seed, The Genetic Code. My present consciousness was <br>
also influenced by the experiences I had in my life up to now, and every bit <br>
of it came to me through my senses and they can be represented digitally also.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Nobody has ever seen even a hint of fundamental new physics in the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;matter of the brain,            </i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;That is simply because we filter all information through the </i><br>
<i>        &gt;abstracting filter of our senses.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I don't quite know what to make of that. Of course, everything we know or <br>
will ever know about the world ultimately comes from our senses. So what?  <br>
<p>
Science can find no difference between one atom and another, a Hydrogen atom <br>
in my body is identical to one in yours so that can't be what makes my <br>
consciousness different from yours. True, matter is needed for me to exist,  <br>
but that's not the important part because matter is generic so any matter <br>
will do, good thing too,  the matter in my body is quite different than it  <br>
was a year ago. The important thing is the way the matter is organized and  <br>
the name for that is information. I am not an object, I am not a noun, I am  <br>
an adjective, I am the way matter reacts when it is organized in certain ways. <br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We have never looked for or even had the tools to look for actual         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;phenomenal qualities.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If we have ever "looked" we must have used senses to do so.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We know, abstractly, how an atom interacts with other matter         </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, I even know how you interact with other matter.            <br>
<p>
                           <br>
<i>        &gt;but we have no idea what it is like to be that atom.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, I'm not an atom, so I can not be something I'm not. I'm  not you so  <br>
I'll never know for sure exactly what it's like to be you, only you know that,  <br>
in fact, I think that's the definition of "you". If I did know what it's  <br>
like to be you then I'd be you.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;information is nothing unless it is represented by something         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;physically real.</i><br>
              <br>
<p>
Two erroneous opinions I have plus two other erroneous opinions I have  are <br>
still equal to 4. Are my erroneous opinions  physically real? <br>
<p>
There is no point dancing around it, what we're talking about is the soul. <br>
Information is as close as you can get to the traditional concept of the soul  <br>
and still remain within the scientific method.  Consider the similarities:<br>
<p>
1) The soul is non material and so is information.  <br>
<p>
2) It's difficult to pin down a unique physical position for the soul, and       <br>
   the same is true for information. Exactly where is the location of the       <br>
   information that Caesar was a Roman or that 2 +2 =4 ?  <br>
<p>
3) The soul is the essential, must have, part of consciousness, exactly the       <br>
   same situation is true for information.  <br>
<p>
4) The soul is immortal and so, potentially, is information.     <br>
<p>
There are also important differences between the soul and information:  <br>
<p>
1) The soul can't be duplicated but information can be.  <br>
<p>
2) The soul is and will always remain unfathomable, but information is       <br>
   understandable, in fact, information is the ONLY thing that is <br>
   understandable.<br>
<p>
3) Information unambiguously exists, I don't think anyone would deny that,        <br>
   but even if the soul exists it will never be proven.                                                         <br>
                                                         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;just because abstract binary representations can represent color as         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;good as our sensations can doesn't mean they are the same         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;fundamental representations.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why not? In Science if two things react in exactly the same way then they're <br>
the same.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;They are not consciously like each other though they can both         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;simulate or represent each other in an abstract way.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I strongly disagree. In daily life we use behavior to determine what other <br>
people are thinking and are likely to do next, it seems to work pretty well.  <br>
What evidence do you have that two entities can behave exactly the same way <br>
yet have different consciousness?<br>
<p>
It seems to me that the mind is what the brain does, if two brains are doing  <br>
the same thing then there is only one mind.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>      &gt;A red sensation is not an unobservable characteristic.   </i><br>
    <br>
<p>
I can't prove it but the evidence is very good that what you say is true.      <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>           &gt;We just don't yet have the tools to eff such feelings.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
But we already have the tool, imperfect though it may be, it's the exact same  <br>
tool that evolution used to make consciousness in the first place, behavior.  <br>
The conclusion is clear, intelligence is impossible without consciousness.<br>
