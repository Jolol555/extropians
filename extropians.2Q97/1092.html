I've been following some of the food combining thread. I got into the Fit<br>
For Life books a while back and tried their suggestions for at least a year<br>
and a half.  My cholesterol ratio was bad, so I was looking to exercise more<br>
and change my diet in order to bring it down. I tried to follow the food<br>
combing program... Fruit in the morning, bagels for lunch, salad and low fat<br>
protein for dinner. I didn't lose any fat and my cholesterol didn't improve<br>
even though I rode my bike and climbed some. Then almost exactly a year ago<br>
I heard one of the authors of "Protein Power" on the radio, and went and<br>
bought that book, and later "The Zone" by Barry Sears, PH.D.  ["Protein<br>
Power" by Michael R. Eades, M.D. and Mary Dan Eades, M.D.  "Why too many<br>
carbohydrates in your diet stimulate your insulin production, which actually<br>
makes your body store fat."] <br>
<p>
I caution that neither book cites much in the way of controlled scientific<br>
studies of their diet.  <br>
<p>
These books look at something that the Fit For Life program seems to<br>
ignore...the insulin-stimulating effects of a high carbohydrate diet and the<br>
problems that brings.<br>
Insulin activates the enzymes that run the cholesterol-making apparatus,<br>
resulting in overproduction of cholesterol. <br>
<p>
"Our own cells make cholesterol and lots of it. In fact, 70 to 80% of the<br>
cholesterol burbling along in your blood vessels was made by your own body.<br>
Only 20 to 30% came from your diet. Every cell in the body has the capacity<br>
to make cholesterol, but most is made in the liver, the intestines, and the<br>
skin, with the vast majority coming from the liver cells. Elevated levels of<br>
insulin spur these cells to churn out vast amounts of cholesterol, leading<br>
to elevated blood levels." (Protein Power, pg 33-34)<br>
<p>
Our body needs cholesterol, and when the c. level in each cell goes down, it<br>
can produce it internally or it can increase the LDL receptors on the<br>
surface of the cell and take cholesterol out of the blood, or a combination<br>
of both. If you interfere with the internal production of cholesterol (as<br>
the cholesterol drug lovastatin does), LDL receptors rush to the surface of<br>
the cell to pluck the LDL cholesterol our of the bloodstream, bringing about<br>
a quick and significant lowering of LDL cholesterol in the blood. But<br>
lovastatin has caused liver problems, muscular disorders, etc. Protein Power<br>
claims that you can get the cholesterol-lowering results w/o having to<br>
resort to drug therapy. <br>
<p>
There is one step in the cholesterol synthesis pathway inside the cell<br>
called the rate-limiting step [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A<br>
(HMG-CoA)reductase] that determines how fast and how much cholesterol gets<br>
produced. Insulin stimulates HMG-CoA reductase, while glucagon inhibits it.<br>
A diet high in carbs calls forth insulin, but a diet with lower carbs puts<br>
you in a glucagon mode.<br>
<p>
Since my wife is an insulin dependent diabetic, I had already known that<br>
when she has to take insulin to cover for her impending meal, carbs raise<br>
her blood sugar more quickly. Some new, radical approaches to controlling<br>
diabetes stress cutting carb consumption dramatically, so you take much less<br>
insulin. I had tracked down an out-of-print book by a doctor with a clinic<br>
on Long Island who has had success with this program, so I thought I might<br>
try decreasing my carb consumption also. "Protein Power" predicted that a<br>
very low carb diet would quickly and dramatically lower triglycerides. Then<br>
HDL would gradually rise, and LDL would lower.<br>
<p>
I went on a very low carb diet, and my triglycerides dropped 200 points in 2<br>
weeks. My HDL did rise, very slightly, and my LDL dropped about 30, my total<br>
c went down by about 35. I also lost about 4 inches off my waist over the<br>
course of several months. Unfortunately, the medical plan I have won't let<br>
me order the blood tests I would like, and I have to see the doctor before<br>
getting tests done. So this data is very limited. I wouldn't do this<br>
yourself without considering everything carefully. <br>
<p>
Where this dovetails slightly with food combining is that in the early, very<br>
low carb phase that Protein Power recommends if you have bad cholesterol<br>
ratios, high blood pressure, or are more than 20% overweight; you shoot for<br>
30 grams of carbs a day. This means you don't combine much because you<br>
hardly eat ANY starch. Later you raise your carb level to 40% of the<br>
calories at any meal, with 30% protein and 30% fat [The Zone]. You figure<br>
how much protein to eat by figuring your lean body mass and by multiplying<br>
that figure by .5 grams of protein daily (if you are sedentary, .6 if you do<br>
some exercise, etc.) and dividing that up into 3 meals.<br>
<p>
Protein Power claims that game hunting was the primary means of sustenance<br>
for our ancestors 700,000 years ago. From that time until the beginnings of<br>
agriculture about 8,000 to 10,000 years ago) 60 to 90% of the calories in<br>
mans diet was from large and small game animals, birds, eggs, reptiles and<br>
insects. <br>
<p>
"The forces of natural selection acting over some 7,000 centuries shaped and<br>
molded our physiology to function optimally on a diet consisting<br>
predominantly of meat supplemented with roots, shoots, berries, seeds and<br>
nuts. Only within the last 100 centuries have we reversed the order to<br>
become mainly carbohydrate eaters with meat as the supplement. This dietary<br>
reversal-from a diet providing, on average, about 75% of its calories from<br>
some sort of meat with the remainder coming from plants to one in which only<br>
25% of calories comes from meat, the rest from other sources, has taken<br>
place in approximately 400 to 500 generations, far short of the 1,000 to<br>
10,000 generations deemed necessary by geneticists to allow any substantial<br>
generic changes to take place. We may yet adapt to the high carbohydrate<br>
agriculture diet, but history tells us it will probably take another 10,000<br>
years."(Protein Power pg 17).<br>
<p>
I've found a book called "The Paleolithic Diet" and am checking this out.<br>
<p>
In the meantime, I think Fit For Life or Food Combining pushes carbs too<br>
much. Your mileage may vary.<br>
