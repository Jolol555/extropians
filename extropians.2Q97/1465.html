In a roleplaying campaign set in 2017 I actually thought about this<br>
problem: as enhanced reality became commonplace, lots of<br>
office-workers began to move into the parks, cafes and jogging<br>
tracks. Eventually there was a reaction, and it became socially<br>
unacceptable to be a "walking office" in such places.<br>
<p>
(This roleplaying setting also involves plenty of semi-intelligent<br>
agents, "lego corporations" which can be assembled in any way you<br>
like it, enhanced reality games overaild on reality and some rather<br>
bizarre nootropics. I'm having quite a lot of fun working it out,<br>
although the main theme is magic and conspiracy)<br>

<p>
Very true. I think there will be a demand for wearables once people<br>
realize how useful they are. How will they be useful? People will<br>
invent uses, our speculations are probably quite limited. <br>
<p>
Just a few loose ideas: with a camera and a direct link to the police<br>
or some buffer computer you could have an easy way of crime<br>
prevention; if somebody tries to mug you his picture/voiceprint will<br>
be in the police files unless he can disable the wearable without<br>
coming near it (you could have 360 degree coverage). This is similar<br>
to the system mentioned in David Brin's _Earth_. Perfect for nervous<br>
ladies.<br>
<p>
Enhanced reality games overlaid on reality: imagine playing Doom with<br>
your friends for real! Watch out for the car-monsters, they can also<br>
kill for real...<br>
<p>
Guide agents that can guide you around, show the optimal path in a<br>
building or demonstrate information.<br>
<p>
Collaborative mindmapping and sketching in 3D.<br>
