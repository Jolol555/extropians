For what its worth I find that you are being sensible.  It seems that the<br>
only sort of response that is acceptable in this sort of situation is to<br>
overflow with feelings of warmth at one's new found status.  I have found<br>
it is too much trouble to meet people's expectations of how excited I<br>
should look.  When I tried I spent a great deal of effort on my external<br>
expressions and very little actually enjoying what was going on.  Of<br>
course, its also rather foolish to go out of your way to show how not<br>
impressed you are although I doubt you did this.  It is very annoying when<br>
people ask for honest opinions, either directly or implied, and then get<br>
annoyed when one doesn't give the opinion they want. <br>
