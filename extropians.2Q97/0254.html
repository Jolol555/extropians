<p>
Depends on the goal.  Some require special talent, some the right body, and<br>
some really good luck.  Most people have essentially no chance of ever being<br>
a chess grandmaster, a basketball star, or a actor/actress, regardless of the<br>
preparation or perseverence.  One of my cousins has acted in numerous plays<br>
and gone to many acting schools for a decade now and has gotten nowhere.  A<br>
friend of mine tried for years to get into scriptwriting - and I, a natural<br>
critic, liked many of his works - but he never got anywhere past "let's do<br>
lunch" and one flaky director.<br>
<p>

<i>&gt;those who only try, those who follow Yoda and live by "There is no try,</i><br>
<i>&gt;do or do not." have good chances.</i><br>
<p>
Preparation and perseverence are necessary, but not sufficient, to have good<br>
chances.  One must also try to do something for which one is well-suited.<br>
 Things which many, many people want to do but at which only a few succeed<br>
are often things one's chances are poor no matter your determination.<br>
