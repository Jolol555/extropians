	We have none of that where we live.  Merchants take a two-hour lunch and<br>
leave their outdoor displays and goods in place, unguarded.  The stores<br>
leave such things as fertilizer, wood, potting soil outside, unguarded  at<br>
all times.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; So now I try to invoke my Extropian dynamic optimism.  </i><br>
<p>
	EDO is a great tonic too!  A real pick-you-up!  And it can be infectious!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Along those lines, does anyone have any suggestions for how to raise a </i><br>

<p>
	We committed the Moronic sin not once, not twice, but FIVE times!   Four<br>
of the five have gone on to commit the Moronic sin a total of TEN times! <br>
When will the madness end?  When will the "I'M-IN-CLOSE-THE-DOOR" people be<br>
satisfied?<br>
	Our children all turned out to be independent thinkers and might be<br>
mistaken for being Extro except they, like ourselves did not know about<br>
Extros. (someone can take this up with the publicity department)  They were<br>
not subjected to violence by spanking or hitting.  They were respected for<br>
the individuals they were, and in turn they returned that respect. <br>
Non-Interference and self-responsibility was a daily way of life and the<br>
babies grew up with those principles being experienced; which is a great<br>
way to learn.  When we interfere with the life of our economy we only make<br>
it worse.  What evidence do we have that we can interfere with the life of<br>
our children, a much more complex event,  and make their lives better?<br>
