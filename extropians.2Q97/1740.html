<p>
Let's leave in abeyance the question of `historical phases' and<br>
`discontinuities', and turn to the second possible schema governing this<br>
cycle of dominants.  Consider the metaphor of an individual human's passage<br>
(as mapped by Jean Piaget and other developmental specialists) from infancy<br>
to death.  Might this genetically hardwired sequence provide insight into<br>
cultural patterns of growth and decay - if indeed there really are any such<br>
regularities, the kinds alleged by enthusiasts for long cycles of<br>
historical recurrence?<br>
<p>
It might seem that even so `genealogical' a metaphor must offend against<br>
contemporary taste, insinuating a determinism repugnant to our<br>
sensibilities, one especially distasteful to today's heightened awareness<br>
of contingency and the non-linearities of complexity theory.  To a<br>
generation of poststructuralists attuned to Michel Foucault's strictures on<br>
dispersed, `micro-power' vectors in preference to centralising,<br>
`macro-power', any apparently organicist metaphor must look preposterous.  <br>
<p>
Is there any reason to suppose that the shape of our lives (let alone our<br>
cognitive structures) is segmented beyond, say, age 14 or 16?  I think<br>
there is.  Confucius, in the fifth century BC, offered a celebrated<br>
partitioning that is still resonant: `At 15 I set my heart on learning; at<br>
30 I was firmly established; at 40 I had no more doubts; at 50 I knew the<br>
will of Heaven; at 60 I was ready to listen to it; at 70 I could follow my<br>
heart's desire without transgression.'<br>
<p>
So let us split up a notional 20th century Western lifetime into somewhat<br>
arbitrary but not absurd sectors of 12.5 years.  What's more, I will code<br>
these according to the Jakobson schema.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From birth to 12.5: early construction of the social self, peaking at</i><br>
puberty.  Establishing communication channels, seguing into addressee as<br>
social self (Algorithm-to-We).<br>
<p>
12.5 to 25: the construction of the addresser's individual self, peaking at<br>
the establishment of early parental role (I). <br>
<p>
25 to 37.5: emphasis shifting away from individual subjectivity toward<br>
confident dealings with, especially exploration of, the large-scale `real'<br>
or objective world (It). <br>
<p>
37.5 to 50: the `writing' of message into the world, peaking with one's<br>
children rearing their own first children (Text/Theory).  <br>
<p>
50 to 62.5: consolidated mastery of the codes of culture and world alike,<br>
peaking with the shift from specific competences to supervisory roles and<br>
preparation for retirement (Code). <br>
<p>
62.5 to 75: mature settling into `elder' role, custodian of the mores and<br>
channels of social order, and preparation for death (Algorithm). <br>
<p>
Posit that this developmental history reflects a flexible genetic/cultural<br>
clock regulating individual development with some robustness across many<br>
cultures.  Clearly, this is likely to have altered in an unprecedented<br>
degree during the 20th century, when its later phases became stretched out<br>
by our own high-tech medical culture, with delayed or extended<br>
child-rearing, healthy maturity, and senescence.  Still, it is feasible<br>
that such a grand template might be assimilated and rehearsed in broad<br>
cultural shifts of Jakobsonian Dominant (within, of course, the limits of<br>
each bounded culture or civilisation).  <br>
<p>
Is such a weather cycle of discourse feasible?  Climatic phases might be<br>
recurrent, but aren't we humans set free of biology, children of<br>
self-reflexive, infinitely mutable culture?  While a naturalist such as E.<br>
O. Wilson might hope to draw broad sociobiological lessons from animal<br>
behaviour and the laws of Darwinism, these days it is generally regarded as<br>
an illicit move within the humane specialties.  The fashion in human<br>
studies is `thick description', empathetic immersion in local ways.  Global<br>
grand theories of social structure and change are routinely rejected as<br>
misguided and simplistic.  <br>
<p>
The case is not, however, so simply dismissed.  Anthropologist Ernest<br>
Gellner notes: `Most pre-scientific societies... build up a tolerably<br>
coherent world-picture, in which background world-story, social<br>
organization, and natural fact are all congruent.  The time-ordering<br>
sub-system will tend to dovetail in with the personal hierarchy sub-system:<br>
the big periodic festival, marking the seasonal rhythm, also underwrites<br>
the hieratic rankings' (Plough, Sword and Book: the Structure of Human<br>
History).  Given this traditional interlock, it would be unsurprising if<br>
the palpably biological stages of individual developmental were folded into<br>
the grander seasons of a society's ebbs and flows.  <br>
<p>
Of course, each year brings new births and deaths, so one might wonder how<br>
a universal such as the developmental cycle might be registered (prior to<br>
the epoch of great punctuating global wars) against the continuum of<br>
history.  Hunter-gatherers will indeed tend to blur time into timelessness,<br>
interrupted chiefly by random natural catastrophes or rich years,<br>
time-bonded by the round of annual liturgies.  <br>
<p>
Once civil society has precipitated, however, the clock tends to be set by<br>
the accession of chiefs, kings, or perhaps high priests or prophets and<br>
external conquerors.  Although somewhat discontinuous, these in turn will<br>
tend to follow the generational unfolding of a healthy human family (since<br>
kings and priests live well, if spared in battle).  Ecology itself can<br>
provide a calibration mechanism, chiefly through shifts in the prevalence<br>
of game or agricultural produce.  We are biologically adapted to such<br>
roughly boom-and-bust dietary cycles.  <br>
<p>
Well, might the `life-span' sequence map the stages of historical change<br>
within a limited cultural trajectory?  Where one comparatively recent<br>
Western discursive phase, say, favoured the `I' node (romanticism), another<br>
found its expression principally as Text/Theory (modernism in painting and<br>
literature/ relativity/ quantum theory), yet another within Code (the<br>
structuralist dominant/ DNA decoding/ particle physics)...  <br>
<p>
We tend to assume that such aggregations are either accidental, or emerge<br>
in response to internal pressures from within the disciplines themselves.<br>
Might we wonder if, instead, such discursive dominants - though hardly the<br>
content of their exact formulations - follow each another according to a<br>
certain predictable order, and for a certain term?  <br>
