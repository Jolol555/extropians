That's fine, people vary; but most people are more satisfied by 100 calories<br>
of carbohydrate than 100 calories of fat.  Of course there are many other<br>
variables affecting the feeling of satiety.<br>
<p>

<p>
No; the studies show there is an advantage to having a low quantity of<br>
*calories* in your diet (above starvation, of course).  High-fat, low-fat, no<br>
big deal, as long as the calories are low.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I also thought that studies showed that the life-extension properties of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;low calorie diet went we beyond just having a low quantity of fat in your</i><br>
<i>&gt;diet; say the difference b/w living to 90 on a low-fat diet and 130 on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;low-calorie diet (i.e. low-fat helps you reach your max. life span,</i><br>
<i>&gt;low-calorie actually slows the aging process and thus extend your life span</i><br>
<i>&gt;significantly).</i><br>
<p>
Yes.  That's the benefit I was referring to.  But medium-calorie is better<br>
than high-calorie, too; it's just that exercise can reduce or eliminate the<br>
health risks of high-calorie (but not, apparently, those of medium-calorie).<br>
