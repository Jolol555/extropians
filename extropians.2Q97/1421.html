This notion that the Borg are uncreative doesn't wash with me.  All those<br>
people standing around, their minds all hooked up, forming the Collective...<br>
What are they thinking *about*?  Surely such a mind could see the strategic<br>
necessity of advancing technology.<br>
<p>
This also raises the question, how did the Borg acquire the technology they<br>
have?  Generally speaking, in a competition, the higher technology will<br>
win, especially when you are talking about phasers and shields and warp<br>
drives.  So the Borg should be unable to defeat an enemy with higher<br>
technology than themselves.  The only reason they are a threat to the<br>
Federation is because they have better technology.<br>
<p>
This means that they should not have been able to assimilate a race which<br>
possessed their current technology if all they had was Federation-style<br>
phasers or something weaker.  Their ships would not have constituted a<br>
threat to such a race.<br>
<p>
I conclude that the Borg evolved as individuals (or at least in a state<br>
where they could make technological progress) until they reached their<br>
present level, *then* they formed the Collective as we see it, which has<br>
stagnated technologically for some reason.<br>
<p>
Of course, we all recognize that the Star Trek universe is a spectacularly<br>
unlikely future, with their incredibly slow rate of technological<br>
progress, lack of exploitation of nanotech, extremely limited medical<br>
technology, under-utilization of AI despite its clear effectiveness, etc.<br>
