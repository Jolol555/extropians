	Actually, that is probably wrong.  A person can affect the survival of<br>
their genes after reproducing by assisting the young.  Menopause actually<br>
occurs regularly in primitive human societies (in other words, women live<br>
that long).  Fertility is already in decline by that period (probably due<br>
to other agents already discussed) so being able to give birth would not<br>
result in a great success for the genes.  Keeping the elder females around<br>
to help with gathering (they are at least as efficient and sometimes more<br>
so than their younger counterparts, possibly because those of reproductive<br>
age try to reserve energy for reproduction) and to store knowledge does<br>
help the genes.  Keep in mind that in a tribe most people are related.  It<br>
is a fallacy to think that genes don't "care" about a person after they<br>
have reproduced.  Genes care about a person as long as the existence of<br>
that person is a benefit to the genes.<br>
