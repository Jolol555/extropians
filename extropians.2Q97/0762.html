650m children live on less than $1 a day<br>
<p>
Friday, 18 April 1997: Over 650 million children<br>
currently exist on less than $1 a day, according<br>
to UNICEF.<br>
<p>
"Contrary to what the world might expect, the poor<br>
are getting poorer, the number of poor is<br>
increasing, and the disparity between rich and<br>
poor has never been greater," said UNICEF<br>
Executive Director Carol Bellamy.<br>
<p>
According to statistics released by the World Bank<br>
in World Development Indicators 1997, more than<br>
1.3 billion people currently live on less than $1<br>
a day, and a further 2 billion are only marginally<br>
better off. UNICEF believes that children account<br>
for at least 50 per cent of the total number of<br>
poor people.<br>
<p>
"These figures provide further distressing<br>
confirmation that the scourge of poverty is not in<br>
retreat. More children are living in poverty today<br>
than ever before, " said Ms. Bellamy.<br>
<p>
UNICEF argues that the past 50 years have seen an<br>
increase in the number of poor in the world. This<br>
is notwithstanding numerous initiatives -- such as<br>
structural adjustment, support for private<br>
investment and efforts at debt reduction -- all of<br>
which have been designed to increase economic<br>
growth.<br>
<p>
Between 1988 and 1993, the number of people living<br>
below the poverty line of $1 a day increased by at<br>
least 20 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and in<br>
Latin America. The numbers also increased in South<br>
Asia and in the Middle East and North Africa.<br>
<p>
Levels of income disparity between the richest and<br>
poorest 20 per cent of the world population have<br>
increased from 30:1 to 61:1 over the past 30<br>
years, and Ms. Bellamy argued that inequity in the<br>
distribution of wealth and resources explains the<br>
rising number of the poor.<br>
<p>
UNICEF has documented many instances where<br>
impressive progress in the well-being of children<br>
has been achieved without economic growth, through<br>
the investment of limited resources in basic<br>
services, such as health and education. Zimbabwe<br>
increased primary school enrolment from 1.2<br>
million to 2.1 million pupils and expanded its<br>
immunization coverage from 32 per cent to 75 per<br>
cent during the 1980s at a time of stagnating<br>
average per capita income. In India, the state of<br>
Kerala reduced its infant mortality rate from 55<br>
to 17 per 1,000 live births between 1976 and 1992,<br>
despite very slow economic growth.<br>
<p>
In contrast, significant but inequitable economic<br>
growth in other countries has led to actual<br>
increases in the level of real and relative<br>
poverty. For example, Botswana recorded very rapid<br>
economic growth of 10 per cent per year in the<br>
1980s, but the number of poor in the country did<br>
not decline. Brazil and Honduras saw an increase<br>
in both the number and proportion of poor people<br>
during the 1980s, despite a reasonable rate of<br>
economic growth.<br>
<p>
"The eradication of poverty must be at the centre<br>
of our development efforts into the 21st century.<br>
For as long as poverty is allowed to grow<br>
unchecked, child malnutrition, preventable disease<br>
and widespread illiteracy will continue to<br>
thrive," said Ms. Bellamy.<br>
