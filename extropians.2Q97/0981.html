 <br>
If this was the case then why did we start eating meat in the first<br>
place?  If because it tastes good, *why* do we think meat tastes good?<br>
<p>
And I must say, one serving of beans doesn't seem to give anywhere the<br>
amount of protein that a serving of lean meat does.  More fiber, less<br>
fat, yes, but 8g vs. 17+g of protein.<br>

<p>
Speaking of which, one idea the calorie-restriction people kick around<br>
is whether previous nutritional research, particularly on the benefits<br>
of vegetarianism and low-fatness, were actually studies of mild calorie<br>
restriction.  Is it "fat bad (for some chemical reason)" or "excess<br>
calories bad, and fat translates to lots of calories"?<br>
