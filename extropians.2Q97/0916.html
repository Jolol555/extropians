<p>
The Hiroshima bomb used a gun to fire a slug of U235 at a target also of U235, <br>
it was the only gun type A bomb ever made. Of course the plutonium bomb used <br>
a sphere of explosives, but it was not TNT it was HMX, also called Octogen, <br>
a much faster explosive, it has a detonation velocity of 9100 meters per <br>
second verses 7000 for TNT. <br>

       HMX or OCTOGEN<br>
<p>
             <br>
If you're willing to sacrifice a little efficiency you could use TNT and <br>
it's a lot cheaper. The HMX did not push directly on the plutonium it pushed <br>
on a heavy tamper sphere of U238 (the easy to obtain type) around the inner <br>
sphere of plutonium. The U238 sphere was not involved in any nuclear <br>
reactions it was used because it is a dense metal, it reflected neutrons back <br>
to their source, it helped to make the spherical shock wave more even, and <br>
when the plutonium started to get hot its great mass slowed its expansion to <br>
give the plutonium more time to complete its nuclear reactions.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Krytrons are used in other things besides bombs, in the oil        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;exploration industry for example. The EGG corporation makes them,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;part number RN22, cost 80$.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Excuse me? SUre there are similar components used for explosives use,        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;but they have nowhere near the same tolerance level. Your 80 cent        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;component cannot be used for the detonation sphere of a plutonium         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;bomb.</i><br>
<p>
That's 80 dollars, and they have no use in conventional explosives but they <br>
are used in neutron activation analysis, a very peaceable purpose. You'd have <br>
to use a Krytron in a Uranium bomb, but not with plutonium, although it would <br>
be more efficient if you did.<br>

<i>        &gt;ANy more specific data or info sources?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
A good article on muon catalyzed nuclear fusion in the July 1987 Scientific <br>
American, in those days it was a very good magazine.<br>
