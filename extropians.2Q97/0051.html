  I think it makes sense here to draw distinctions<br>
between perceptions, feelings, emotions, urges, and<br>
expressions.<br>
<p>
  Perceptions, including physical, may cause emotions,<br>
or may not, or emotions may arise without physical<br>
perception (e.g., you figure out a solution to some<br>
problem, or remember something).  The fact that<br>
perceptions may cause emotions doesn't mean they are<br>
equal.<br>
  Perceptions may also cause feelings - e.g., cold,<br>
or itch - those are different from emotions.<br>
  Urges are things like hunger, lust, etc.<br>
The difference between urges and emotions, IMO, is that<br>
urges are born on a level of an organ/subsystem, and<br>
express its needs to the rest of the individual; emotions<br>
are born on the level of the individual, and _may_ be<br>
expressed socially.   Expression is not the emotion though.<br>
Example: anger is an emotion; frowning is an expression.<br>
<p>
The need for emotions, as I see it, arises in primitive<br>
systems that are unable to figure out causes and effects<br>
and plan their actions intelligently.<br>
<p>
Suppose you want to program a rabbit for optimal behavior.<br>
You could explain to it its intended role in evolution,<br>
and ask it to choose appropriate behaviors in all life<br>
situations.  That may be pretty hard for a rabbit to do<br>
consciously, as it doesn't have enough general intelligence;<br>
hardwiring a complex analytical system into the rabbit's<br>
brain is too difficult for the blind evolutionary mechanism.<br>
The solution here would be to program "one-step smarts" into<br>
the rabbit.  If you see a wolf, run; if you see a fox, run;<br>
if you see a hawk, hide; if you see a falling stone, jump.<br>
The rules would be more compact and general if they are<br>
grouped.<br>
 (wolf,fox,hawk,stone) -&gt; [State "danger", bad]<br>
 [Everything OK]       -&gt; [State "happiness", good]<br>
Now, you program into the rabbit a desire to avoid bad states<br>
and achieve good ones, and appropriate reactions for each state,<br>
and the job is done.  The perception of each of these states by<br>
the rabbit is an emotion.  The perceptions of its causes, and<br>
resulting behaviors are connected to emotions, but are already<br>
a different matter.<br>
  It is really easy to program such one-state rules into a computer.<br>
You can write a chess program that would "feel good" every time it<br>
takes an opponent's piece, "scared" every time its piece may be taken,<br>
"angry" when it happens, and "peaceful" in all other cases.  You can<br>
even evolve a population of such programs with a mix of predators,<br>
cowards, and peaceful/aimless piece movers.<br>
One thing you can't do with such "single-step intelligence", is to<br>
develop a good chess program, as chess requires looking more then<br>
one step ahead.  And so do all other problems.  So the best solution<br>
would be to come up with a brain that can do better-than-one-step<br>
situation analysis, equip it with understanding of the rules and<br>
goals, and do away with this primitive emotion stuff.<br>
This is how we program the computers.  They are already beyond emotions.<br>
With ourselves, it is different though; as a legacy system, the human<br>
consciousness is a funny mix of an "inner rabbit" and new rational<br>
thinking mechanisms.   This defines our identity and allows us to have<br>
a lot of fun (usually by misusing the mechanisms wired into us by<br>
nature to optimize our behavior in the woods and monkey tribes), but<br>
may not be the best way to program computers, or engineer the next<br>
generation of intelligence.<br>
  If I ever get a chance to reprogram myself, I would put emotions<br>
under complete control, so that, when I want, I could turn off the bad<br>
ones, and feel the selected good ones.  So that the emotions would<br>
be used only for fun, and will not stand in the way of decision-making<br>
processes, where they tend to mess things up, even when the goal of<br>
decision-making is to optimize future emotions.  I guess this is<br>
something most people are trying to do with their emotions already.<br>
