<i>&gt; I would like help in promoting legislative support for anti-aging </i><br>
<i>&gt; research. We are learning grass roots techniques in influencing </i><br>
<i>&gt; legislation. We need realistic goals that would be accepted by decision </i><br>
<i>&gt; makers.  Letters and phone calls to legislators get results if we know </i><br>
<i>&gt; what issues to promote and have credible information to educate them.</i><br>
<p>
I know that not everyone here shares the radical libertarian views<br>
that I find consistent with Extropian ideals, but you should consider<br>
that enough of us do to make us a bad resource for information on how<br>
to make legislators do anything but go away.  If research on life<br>
extension is your goal--and it is a noble one--then just do it.  Find<br>
the people who can do the research and try to get the funding by free<br>
market voluntary means; if you can't raise the money volutarily, then<br>
the project isn't worth funding by force.<br>
