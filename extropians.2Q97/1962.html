And I thought that meant Bovine Spongiforme Enzephalopathy, also known<br>
as Mad Cow Disease. Maybe that's why that thread seems a bit crazy to<br>
me.<br>

If any such entity exists it will not care about your ridiculous<br>
economic thinking, like having the universe full of stars is a waste of<br>
energy. Transcending the human condition implies thinking capabilities<br>
much higher than that of you and me.<br>
<p>
Energy and time are the least important values to such an entity.<br>
Information is the most important one. Bringing an universe into "order"<br>
would mean destroying an information source, for no purpose. It's not<br>
the calculating power that counts. If it was, the computers of today<br>
would already rule the world. It's the information processed and the<br>
external sensors that count.<br>
<p>
Not infinite power, but infinite knowledge is probably the purpose of<br>
any such entity. <br>
<p>
Virtual realities are insufficient if you want to discover physical laws<br>
formerly unknown to you. You can simulate any reality, but if you don't<br>
know the complete physics, you can't simulate the one necessary. You<br>
must do experiments with the "real" reality. Not experiments damaging<br>
it, but watching it with your sensors and taking care of not being<br>
watched.<br>
<p>
I am sorry to tell you all those entities will be and are non-Extropian<br>
and non-Libertarian, and they will and do definitely not care about<br>
money or economy. Otherwise, we would not exist.<br>
