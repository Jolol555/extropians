I'm hoping you mean this sardonically (ho ho ho, very funny), but if not,<br>
I don't think this argument is going to do you much good on a list as<br>
riddled with agorist anarchists as this one.<br>

Yes, many people like for the state to make their lives more convenient<br>
by telling other people what to do and what not to do. As long as we<br>
continue to rely on a statist system, I can deal with people who want<br>
the state to make their lives more convenient for them by apprehending<br>
and imprisoning violent and larcenous people, but I don't have much<br>
sympathy for those who call for the state to make their lives more<br>
convenient by forcibly imposing restrictions on what sort of information<br>
people may print and distribute.<br>
<p>
Sorry, but in my little world the First Amendment trumps your domestic<br>
convenience. (Begging the pardon of non-Yanks for my self-indulgent<br>
parochialism.)<br>
