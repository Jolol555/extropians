<i>&gt;But, the vast majority of mystics we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have encountered have so many of the traits of Extropians that they would</i><br>
<i>&gt;make you blush...if that was possible.  Perhaps what we are getting at is</i><br>
<i>&gt;there are more people leaning towards Extro thinking than most Extros know</i><br>
<i>&gt;about.  Perhaps it is because there is an attitude amongst some Extros,</i><br>
<i>&gt;much like religious-freaks, that one must believe in the whole package or</i><br>
<i>&gt;be rejected as a heretic.  Many people embrace parts of the Extro view and</i><br>
<i>&gt;could embrace more, if they were invited in a non-threatening way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Certainly they are open to discussion, we have found.</i><br>
<p>
I thought the grounds of extropian belief where an open-mind and the fact<br>
that beliefs aren't forced upon you.  Extro thinking (to me) seems to be<br>
basic, a platform for which to build your own personal concepts of yourself<br>
and the world around you.  Surely anyone with the attitude that you speak of<br>
is not extropic at all!<br>
