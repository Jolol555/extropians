	It is true that there may be various phenomenal qualities to<br>
the infinite amount of possible physical representation methods<br>
employed by various computing devices that we have not yet understood<br>
how to directly observe or for which we don't yet really know what it<br>
is "like".  But, we can know that even if such phenomenal qualities do<br>
exist they are irrelevant by the vary definition of an abstract<br>
representation.  It doesn't matter to the abstract intelligences that<br>
we currently produce whether the representation is punched on paper<br>
tape or stored in high speed volatile transistor arrays.  What the<br>
fundamental nature of the representation is like is not relevant to<br>
the particular information being represented in such a machine.  This<br>
is very different than us.  If you completely rewire an abstract<br>
computer so that what once physically represented red now represents<br>
blue and visa versa, there would be no difference in behavior of the<br>
machine.  The abstract machine would not know the difference.  This is<br>
the definition of abstract knowledge.<br>
<p>
	But, if you did the same thing in the optic nerve of a human<br>
so that it now used a red quale to represent blue wavelengths of light<br>
and visa versa, his favorite color quale would still likely be the<br>
same sensation which would now represent a different wavelength of<br>
light.  What the world would be phenomenally "like" to him would be<br>
drastically different after such a change.  His answer to what red and<br>
blue were like would become inverted.  The abstract intelligence<br>
wouldn't know how to answer such a "what is it like" question, unless<br>
it was abstractly programmed to lie about it.<br>
<p>
	You are right, we are trapped inside our own little spirit<br>
world and can't YET know, other than abstractly, the phenomenal nature<br>
of anything beyond our skull.  Philosophers call this "the veil of<br>
perception." Our senses only know abstractly what the world is like.<br>
But, this will not always be the case.  When we finally objectively<br>
discover what and why these fundamental qualities of our conscious<br>
representation are we will eventually be able to pierce and escape<br>
this mortal spiritual veil and we will be able to know more than<br>
simply the fundamental and/or phenomenal qualities of abstract<br>
representations aren't relevant to what is being represented.  We will<br>
be able to endow machines with the ability to have more than abstract<br>
knowledge.  "Oh THAT's what salt tastes like!"  they will eventually<br>
be able to honestly say after being properly endowed.<br>
