<i>&gt; Of course, and the brain also produces its own melatonin, which </i><br>
<i>&gt; complicates the results...</i><br>
<p>
No, that doesn't complicate them at all.  It may /affect/ them,<br>
but the results are the results; we're not looking for reasons or<br>
explanations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You might do the same experiment with headaches and aspirin and get </i><br>
<i>&gt; the same inconclusive results.</i><br>
<p>
I doubt it very seriously.  The effects of aspirin are well-tested,<br>
outperform placebos by miles, and are easy to describe.  I have done<br>
similar tests, for example, to determine which of the various common<br>
anagesics works best for me, and the results were quite dramatic:<br>
acetominophen had no effect I could measure (on me; I have no reason<br>
to doubt its clinical worth in general), ibuprofen worked, but aspirin<br>
beat 'em both hands down.  The hardest part of doing those experiments<br>
was controlling for caffeine :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Your assumption that "it was probably just due to the ritual" is just </i><br>
<i>&gt; as biased and simplistic (simplistic because it tries to fit a </i><br>
<i>&gt; non-linear, multi-variate situation to a linear, single-variable </i><br>
<i>&gt; equation) as the pill-popper's assumption that it is the pill that is </i><br>
<i>&gt; doing all the work.</i><br>
<p>
I agree--it was a wild guess.  But the experiment was just barely<br>
sufficient to give me some confidence that spending money on the<br>
melatonin wouldn't give any dramatic immediate effects.  That's all<br>
I really cared to know, so I didn't investigate further.  I leave<br>
it to the manufacturers to do more complete tests.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When dealing with human health, moods and cognitive capacities, we are </i><br>
<i>&gt; dealing with a VERY complex system that does not submit to simple </i><br>
<i>&gt; mechanical measurements.</i><br>
<p>
So complexity tells you that you should just give up?  Nonsense.  I do<br>
not concede for one moment that there exists anything I am not capable<br>
of measuring, testing, and understanding /eventually/.  It may be very<br>
difficult; we may not even know how to begin going about it yet.  But<br>
anything we experience is measurable, without exception, if we take<br>
sufficient care in the experiment.  Even if our experiments are sloppy<br>
and our conclusions vague, we're still better off than someone who<br>
doesn't even try.<br>
