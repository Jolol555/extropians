c't, _the_ Kraut computer mag has initiated a PGP key certification<br>
campaign, attempting to link the isolated web'o'trust chain mail<br>
patches. Certification requires a face2face interaction. So far,<br>
several 100 persons submitted their certification entries.<br>
Programme not to be discontinued in near future. Several other<br>
Certification Agencies (CAs) have begun operation as well.<br>

In a DFN CERT meet net security experts defined "Hamburg Declaration<br>
for Encrypton Freedom" -- <a href="ftp://troll.hz.kfa-juelich.de/pub/KRYPTO">ftp://troll.hz.kfa-juelich.de/pub/KRYPTO</a><br>
\\//<br>
An end-March OECD (29 signee countries) paper says cryptography<br>
should be used more to increase trust into info/comm infrastructure/<br>
networks. Free choice of cryptomethods and careful consideration with<br>
regards to state regulation is suggested. Key escrow/key recovering<br>
are mentioned, albeit sans further comment. (Hereabouts, they will<br>
either sink crypto entirely, or make it controlling authority-<br>
transparent as vacuum. Clear as mud).<br>
\\//<br>
I've seen the (ex-)U.S.Robotics Pilot yesterday. Cute, blitzn.<br>
Hotsync. Display sucks, but this has been ameliorated by new<br>
backlit models already. For all practical purposes, the Newton<br>
is dead. As now pieces are soon expected to begin to fall off<br>
the aged Apple zombie, they haven't been able to bring out a<br>
Newton-technology desktop, and the new Newt 2000 is a dog<br>
(according to one fried who sells them), that kinda figures.<br>
\\//<br>
Hitachi's new videocamera (about 5 kDM) can do realtime 1:100 MPEG.<br>
\\//<br>
Both DVD and CD-RW apparently haven't taken wing yet.<br>
CD-RW, floppy++?<br>
\\//<br>
Gateway2000 might acquire Amiga tech &amp; rights from ESCOM AG<br>
which went bankrupt July 1996. Oh my.<br>
\\//<br>
After a police raid on ViPNet, a small Austrian ISP (one customer<br>
of his with hang to cliches reportedly posted some child pornography<br>
to a usenet newsgroup one _year_ ago), ISPA, a 20-ISP organization,<br>
decided to take action. After some brief discussion on the<br>
provider-at@netwing.at list, on 25. March Austria disappeared<br>
from the face of Internet for two hours. In most European<br>
countries, ISPs do not underlie phone/yellow mail legislation,<br>
and thus can be held accountable for the content transmitted.<br>
Little wonder, for there is zero awareness for modern telcom<br>
potential in higher-echelon politics (and not only there).<br>
Any low-natural resource country inhibiting its telco<br>
infrastructure growth should remember it acting in a<br>
darwinian theatre. Good riddance.<br>
\\//<br>
Memphis, aka Win97, will not be delivered before 1998.<br>
\\//<br>
Vobis, a popular teutonic computer chain, will offer a 64 MByte<br>
RAM, 1 MB 2nd cache, 4 GByte IDE HD, 4 MByte gfx board and 8x<br>
CD ROM Alpa for 6 kDM. Muckischrott NT 4.0 and FX!32 (a smart<br>
run-time Intl-Alpha code compiler) is bundled. Won't sell, of<br>
course.<br>
\\//<br>
IBM is attempting to place OS/2 in large customer market<br>
segment solely, is pushing VoiceType. One OS/2 user I know says<br>
IBMs voice technology is actually usable, albeit requiring some<br>
getting used to (both on part of the user and the system).<br>
\\//<br>
AMD's K6, Digital's 0.533 GHz 21164PC and Cyrix-M2 are next hot chips<br>
to watch. On 14 March Intel went to court against AMD/Cyrix regarding<br>
unathorized use of their MMX(tm). (Regarding MMX, could anybody (h)url<br>
the MMX opcode list my way? Even braindead SIMD is kinda useful for<br>
sci code. Thanx).<br>

DEC's 21164 0.6 GHz (18 SPECint95/27 SPECfp95) is official.<br>
\\//<br>
(Gra)Merc(y)ed: Production mid-1999. First 0.25 um on 300 mm^2 die.<br>

TFT LCD, the end of CRT? Combatting yersinia pestis with<br>
salmonella typhimurium, imho.<br>
No TI's MDM DLP in sight, though encountered a Liesegang<br>
MDM beamer ad already. Yield trouble?<br>
\\//<br>
ScanTalk by Olympus, an OCR scanner with speech synthesis.<br>
Useful not only for the elderly. Hexaglot/WizCom OCRs, and<br>
translates, no Babel, but also, no olympic babble. Bummer.<br>
\\//<br>
Motorola has defined WebRef, an MPC800-based NC specification.<br>
Among others, HDS Network systems and Microware, will offer<br>
netOS and OS-9 support. Who's afraid of the nanokernel?<br>
\\//<br>
Hot plugging and power managent to be soon part of PCI specs.<br>
Still no news of cheap fiber optics standard/multiple serial<br>
buses finishing off the backplane bus. However, remember<br>
SGI Octane's 1.6 GByte/link crossbar. Leaving Archaicum; please<br>
fasten your seat belts.<br>
\\//<br>
I_2O brings mainframe architecture to the PC server, a yet<br>
another reminder of PC ontogony recapitulating mainframe<br>
philogeny. Dust off your palantir, gaze into some<br>
cutting-edge supercomputer designs to learn what the future<br>
might bring.<br>
\\//<br>
net.jet, a Java application for Nettscrape &gt;2.0 will suck<br>
this-document referenced pages into local cache, thinking<br>
ahead of user's mouse. Access latency? Which access latency?<br>
<a href="http://www.peak-media.com">http://www.peak-media.com</a><br>
\\//<br>
Eagle DMi by Exabyte/Eagle will bring a 13 GByte uncompressed/<br>
cartridge, 4 MByte/s tape drive. This will suffice for video.<br>
\\//<br>
Mannesman Arcor, o.tel.o &amp; Viag Interkom, local Telekomm rivals,<br>
plan to use wireless/cable TV links to the end customer, since<br>
lacking final few km to the user (ruling Telekomm, naturaly<br>
will try to keep a monopol on end-customer terminal links).<br>
Alternatively, utilizing power grid infrastructure for data<br>
transmission is contemplated. Internet blasting optically<br>
from skies seems a better choice, though. Speaking of that,<br>
when (compressed) video-bandwidth cellular links?<br>
\\//<br>
Nokia presented Cellular Card Phone, Ericsson GSM Data Card GC25,<br>
a cellular phone on a PCMCIA, a cell modem with a headset. Still<br>
lacking headup video, but getting closer.<br>
\\//<br>
Roomancer by Moove <a href="http://www.moove.com">http://www.moove.com</a> . Walk your friend's<br>
file system, avatars tete a tete.<br>
\\//<br>
3d accelerated, TV, and video is booming, as always. Expect<br>
truly VR-useful video hardware in a couple of years.<br>
\\//<br>
Kai Krause, major gfx tool wizard (father of KPT, Goo), has<br>
presented Metashow and Soap. Impressive.<br>
\\//<br>
NCs/Java languish still, as does USB. Good riddance (for the latter).<br>
\\//<br>
Digital photography has taken wing, silver stock will definitely not<br>
be a good future investment. The palmtop Color ZR by Sharp (about<br>
2.2 kDM) has a 18 cm 0.27 MPixel TFT, a CCD, and a uphone. 90<br>
snapshots will fit in memory. Adding a Sirf GPS chipset, and<br>
abovementioned cellular modem/phone hybrid, this will be almost<br>
equivalent to the personal communicator I predicted some one year<br>
ago.<br>
\\//<br>
ALife robot colony research is now mainstream. A thimbleful of<br>
EHW thrown in for good measure, makes for a hot tetranitromethane<br>
cocktail. Hold onto your heads.<br>
