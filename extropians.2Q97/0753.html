&lt;The problem is that in many fields it is extremely easy to influence <br>
an experiment with one's preconceptions, and even easier to interpret <br>
the results in the way that fits them (psychology is a wonderful <br>
example).  Especially if you have a firm emotional belief about the <br>
subject (imagine that you are a scientist looking at the dangers of a <br>
illegal drug or a scientist looking at the possible side-effects of a <br>
vitamin - guess which scientist is most likely to find chromosome <br>
damage?).&gt;<br>
<p>
I recall a short Science News story from the late 80s where some <br>
researcher discovered that use of cannabinoids (in rats or humans?) <br>
created a supplementary network of neural connections in the brain. <br>
 The biased researcher, of course, immediately called this "brain <br>
damage".<br>

Mike Rose:<br>
&lt;We are PART of nature, we grew out of it, we weren't placed here as <br>
objective observers by God. We grew out of that which we observe and <br>
we cannot separate the observer from the observed (except in thought <br>
and language).&gt;<br>
<p>
But what a difference that exception makes!<br>

You might find the following quote on this issue of interest:<br>
&lt;An epistemology is a theory or practice that establishes the <br>
conditions that make knowledge possible. There are many <br>
epistemologies. Religious mystics, and even some physicists [55], <br>
believe that higher knowledge is achieved by a state of ineffable <br>
oneness with a transcendent reality. Mystics do not make epistemic <br>
cuts. While this may work for the individual, it does not work for <br>
populations that require heritable information or common knowledge <br>
that must be communicable [5]. Knowledge is potentially useful <br>
information about something. Information is commonly represented by <br>
symbols. Symbols stand for or are about what is represented. Knowledge <br>
may be about what we call reality, or it may be about other knowledge. <br>
It is the implementation of "standing for" and "about" - the process <br>
of executing the epistemic cut - that artificial life needs to <br>
explore.<br>
<p>
Heritable, communicable, or objective knowledge requires an epistemic <br>
cut to distinguish the knowledge from what the knowledge is about. By <br>
useful information or knowledge I mean information in the evolutionary <br>
sense of information for construction and control, measured or <br>
selected information, or information ultimately necessary for <br>
survival. This is contrasted with ungrounded, unmeasured, unselected, <br>
hence, purely formal or syntactic information. My usage does not <br>
necessarily imply higher-level cognitive concepts like understanding <br>
and explanation, neither does it exclude them.&gt;<br>
<p>
The above is from Howard Pattee's essay "Artificial life needs a real <br>
epistemology" at<br>
