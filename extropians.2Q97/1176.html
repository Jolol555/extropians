Since I am also expecting my first and only biological child, I am also very<br>
interested in this question.  Newsweek has a special issue out now on child<br>
development, which has an overview of a number of recent breakthroughs in the<br>
study of infant brain development.  Things like, during a certain age period,<br>
the brain wires itself for recognizing phonemes.  People who are raised in<br>
households with different languages use different parts of their brains when<br>
hearing the same phonemes.  The example I've seen is differences in brain<br>
activity when hearing the "r" and "l" sounds, between english speakers and<br>
Japanese speakers.  In the former, the brain lights up in a couple physically<br>
distant spots, while in the latter it doesn't.<br>
<p>
It's becoming clear that from 0 to 3, the brain gets wired in many different<br>
ways, and this early wiring is both critical, and (so far as we know)<br>
irreproducible.  Pretty damn amazing stuff, and the article is highly<br>
recommended.  As the date approaches, I'll be searching out the primary sources.<br>
