<i>&gt;When I noted that one might be contractually oblidged not to go nude</i><br>

<i>&gt;general public.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While it is possible for the owners of such spaces to obligate those</i><br>
<i>&gt;entering them to wear particular clothing or even specific kinds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;clothing, I am unsure about what societal norms are likely to arise in</i><br>
<i>&gt;such spaces, and thus what sorts of obligations are likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;common, and in any case the question is one more of sociology than</i><br>
<i>&gt;law.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;... I suspect (again, without more than a hunch) that as</i><br>
<i>&gt;people become more exposed to exposed people, the amount they will pay</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be free of them would erode with time. People are happy to have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;social norm enforced if they don't have to pay (at least directly) to</i><br>
<i>&gt;do so, but they are less happy to do so if they would have to pay.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure why you think people's preferences regarding nudity would<br>
be very different in the comon areas of a gated private development,<br>
vs. in a private park.  If nudity is prohibited in one are, why<br>
wouldn't it be prohibited in the other as well?<br>
<p>
I don't see why we should think expectations regarding preferences on<br>
nudity should be very far out of equilibrium.  I think most people<br>
know what naked bodies look like.  <br>
<p>
Also, within a small condo complex, does anything now prevents people<br>
who want nudity from offering to pay an amount to the association to<br>
allow it, thereby lowering other owner's fees? <br>
