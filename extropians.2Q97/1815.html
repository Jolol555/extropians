I think religion may have genetic roots.<br>
<p>
 Behaving like there is "somebody out there" to watch after you, may<br>
be an instinct among all young animals. Many genetically programmed<br>
emotional expressions - such as crying - are directly based on the<br>
expectation that there is some Benevolent Observer/Caregiver out<br>
there who would notice you and do some "magic" to improve things.<br>
<p>
 I do not think this instinct is explicitly directed at parents: in<br>
many cases, young animals may have trouble identifying or locating<br>
their parents; also, help may come from other relatives and tribe<br>
members.  Rather, the instinct may be simple: assume that there is<br>
Some Big Smart Entity out there to do things for you, express your<br>
concerns - and they will be addressed.<br>
<p>
  There is such a big evolutionary advantage in having this Reliance<br>
on Big Benevolent Force mechanism that it seems to be the most<br>
important surviving technique for an infant.<br>
<p>
  There doesn't seem to be that much utility in eradicating this<br>
instinct after the baby grows up.  Some parts of it, e.g., public<br>
expression of emotions, may be of use later, as the society is<br>
usually somewhat compassionate.  Other expressions - like crying<br>
alone - may be just an exploitation of the old mechanism that<br>
gives a baby some immediate reward (feeling of relief) after<br>
it cries for help.<br>
  The same may be true about dreaming of the a Big Superior Helper.<br>
Pray/cry to it, and you will get some relief. The relief is given<br>
just by the babyish neural circuit, and is temporary, while the<br>
call for help is futile and based on an invalid extension of the<br>
childhood's reliance on superior adults - but so what?   A wrong<br>
belief in the head of an old animal will do little harm to the<br>
evolutionary process.  It may even be helpful - the sickly adult<br>
would occupy itself with crying instead of getting off its butt<br>
and looking for resources, while its offsprings will enjoy the<br>
saved resources, and try to stay closer to those adults who don't<br>
exhibit signs of weakness.<br>
<p>
  Maybe, it would also be useful for social development if those<br>
weak in the head would spent their time trying to obtain assistance<br>
from God rather than from other people.  However, by some perversion,<br>
they often use the idea of God to extract support from their neighbors...<br>
