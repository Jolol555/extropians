No time right now to craft the reply I want to craft-- just two quick observations...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;difference."  So, I prefer trinities (the Hegelian type, not the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Christian type ;-) to simple dualisms (see Rucker’s _Mind Tools_), as</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;in there being three levels to reality: content, context and contest,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;each of which is distinct from, but relies on, the others.  Put</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;another way, we have agents, environments and interactions (contests</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;between them); and, you can’t have any one of these pieces without the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;other.  So, everything is certainly linked as Mark says; but, that</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;doesn’t mean it’s not necessary to distinguish between them.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Certain things are only possible if distinctions are drawn; certain things are only possible if distinctions are *not* drawn. <br>
<p>
<p>
Sorry if that sounds mysterious or too rubbery.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The command model has frequently been considered more "rational",</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;since it involves the visible application of reason to the economic</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;problem as a whole. Alternatives have frequently been considered</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;irrational and an invitation to chaos. This viewpoint, however, smacks</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;of the creationist fallacy - it assumes that a coherent result</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;requires a guiding plan. In actuality, decentralized planning is</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;potentially more rational, since it involves more minds taking into</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;account more total information. [SNIP]</i><br>
<p>
<p>
There are two other salient points I want to make: there is a presumption that a central plan must be "correct" or "perfectible", and an underlying  epistemological ground that there is such a thing as the one correct set of categories, and all one has to do is find them and force the universe to fit. :) (this observation after Lakoff, of course.)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This is why I think we need many individuals and selves, rather than</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;some Great Borganism, in order to create an extropian multiverse</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;rather than an entropian universe headed for collapse.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I said: This [LILA model] sounds no different to me from the Christian</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Apocalypse &amp; Resurrection.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;And Michael noted:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt;As G. Spencer Brown said, the symbol = may be taken to mean "is</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;confused with".&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I mistakenly posted an earlier version of what I wrote (working on</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;multiple systems can be confusing ;-).  My final version of that</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;statement said: This sounds to me too much like the Christian Original</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Sin, Apocalypse and Resurrection.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;My point about these "New Age" notions of unity (particularly LILA) is</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;that, instead of "Out of Many, One", they want to say, "Out of One,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Many; SO, back to One".  This is a Big Bang to Big Crunch scenario</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and, IMHO, it is Creationist; and, this yearning to "return to the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;One" is a desire to dissolve into the primal soup, an abdication of</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;individual responsibility for carrying on the creation.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Cop out and "turn off your mind, relax and float downstream..."...<br>
<p>
Yeah, I can only stand so much of that myself before I want to stir the pot.  Go ahead and return the the ylem if you want; I promise I'll build something fun from you. :) :)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I haven’t read G. Spenser-Brown, but I did take these notes from F.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;David Peat’s discussion of him in _Synchronicity_:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt; Next, Peat's explores "the work of the logician and mathematician</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;G.Spenser-Brown ... a rather enigmatic figure who first came to the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;attention of the aging Bertrand Russell in 1965.... 'Laws of Form'</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;takes as its origin a basic act of distinction ... once an active</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;observer or a creative act of perception, is admitted into this void,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;then it becomes possible to draw the first distinction ... [which]</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;allows a movement to begin ... A particularly interesting feature of</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;this logic is that it is capable of generating expressions that begin</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;to refer to themselves ... Spenser-Brown's re-entrant forms are in</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;fact self-generating expressions that are capable of perpetuating</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;themselves indefinitely." Peat goes on to explain the importance of</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;context to this Hegelian dialectic; but, he imparts too much</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;significance to the initial creative 'big bang' and not enough to the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;ongoing adaptive process that is thus generated.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;02/11/96. And so, as "Synchronicity" wraps up, Peat curls himself into</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;a sort of fetal position, seeking to return to the womb in a sense, by</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;emphasizing the origin, "the pure, unconditioned perception," what he</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and the mystics call "the stillness", rather than the 'noisy', ongoing</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;"creative unfolding ... able to respond to an ever-changing context." &gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Mark Crosby</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;P.S. re Rick Knight's latest response (read after writing the above):</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt;Frankly, thinking too much and too often makes me rather tired and </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;despondent.  That's why I perceive it important to keep balance,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;breathe in and exhale out.  Quest then rest.&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Nothing wrong with that! That's just balance between Being and</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Becoming.  (I don't mean to be a "rigid fundie" about any of this ;-)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I can't resist one more excerpt from my notes that addresses this:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt;[Peat] confuses Being and Becoming: "The major barriers to a creative</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;transformation of consciousness are the attachments of the self, which</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;give rise to the mechanical order of becoming in which the more subtle</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and faster movements of nature are lost." This is backwards! Being is</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;mechanical and static [or, at least, restful and neutral ;-] .</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Becoming is creative and dynamic. [snip] In lamenting the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;fragmentation of science, the alienation of the individual and the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;decay of civility, he sets up myths that are only true from a limited</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;perspective that is preoccupied with the present. His "better notion</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;of an intense and vibrant stillness" is little different from the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;fashionable notion of "holism" he decries which "suggests a self that</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;becomes immersed in a warm bath of mindless gravy."  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In the end though, it is merely a matter of semantics and taste that</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;distinguishes my view from Peat's because he concludes: "Eternity does</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;not exist outside the self ... to die to the self does not mean to</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;sacrifice all identity or freedom of action in the explicate world.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Rather it suggests a dying of attachments to rigid, fixed forms and an</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;unfolding of sequential time into its wider [fractal] order.... So the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;dissolution of fragmentation does not imply the abandonment of all</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;distinctions and categories; rather, it suggests that distinctions are</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;constantly being created, modified and ended in harmony with the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;general movement of reality." If that is not a description of eternal</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Becoming rather than the static Being of the mystic then I must have</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;my meanings plugged in wrong!&gt;</i><br>
<p>

Looks like I made a liar of myself re: only having time for 2 points. :) Yeah, advocacy of permanent return-to-the-womb is kind of dumb, but it seems clear you're doing the dissection I asked you to do; I was just worried that you were ignoring the positive aspects of samadhi as a choice. Being stuck there is like being stuck anywhere. :) :)<br>
