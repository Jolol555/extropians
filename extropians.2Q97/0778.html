This weekend's Foresight Senior Associate Mini-Gathering in Palo Alto was<br>
supposed to be a minor event, but it isn't working out that way, so we<br>
thought we'd better let you know in case you choose to join up and come to<br>
the meeting.  (Also, feel free to forward this info to interested friends.)<br>
The primary topic, as usual, is nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
The biggest surprise is that Marvin Minsky, an Advisor to Foresight, will<br>
be coming and will speak.  "About what?" you may ask.  With Marvin, one<br>
never knows, but it is always fascinating.  Probably it will at least touch<br>
on nanotechnology.<br>
<p>
Other confirmed speakers include: Eric Drexler, Ralph Merkle, Al Globus,<br>
Deepak Srivastava, Gayle Pergamit, Terry Stanley, and myself.<br>
<p>
In the Senior Associate tradition, we will be asking various attendees to<br>
say a few words informally.  Here are some folks who will be there and who<br>
we hope will step up to this, with speculation on what their topic might<br>
be: Marc Arnold (on the Feynman Prizes and why prizes are a great<br>
motivator), Wayne Gramlich (Web Enhancement), Thomas Landsberger (life<br>
extension), Jim Lewis (the Foresight and IMM web sites), Tom McKendree<br>
(nanotechnology for space development), Chip Morningstar, Ed Niehaus (PR<br>
issues in nanotechnology), Steve Vetter (investing in nanotechnology), Jim<br>
Von Ehr (his nanotechnology startup).<br>
<p>
This is not an exhaustive list by any means; the attendees are many of our<br>
favorite folks and virtually all of them have fascinating things to say,<br>
either to the group or one-on-one.<br>
<p>
If you want to come and haven't let us know yet, please do so IMMEDIATELY<br>
by email (office@foresight.org), phone (+1 415 917 1122), or fax (+1 415<br>
917 1123).<br>
<p>
The fee is $95, to cover our direct costs for food, etc.  The meeting is<br>
open to Senior Associates of Foresight, IMM, and CCIT; Senior Associates<br>
pledge at least  $250 per year for five years; donations are<br>
tax-deductible.  The meeting is off-the-record; no press coverage.<br>
<p>
What to bring: videos to show (label with your name), favorite books to<br>
tell us about (again, label with your name), software on laptops (security<br>
of these is up to you -- one never knows in a hotel), favorite URLs, your<br>
resume if you'd like a new job, and a swimsuit so you can take advantage of<br>
the heated pool.<br>
<p>
Hours are Friday, May 2      8 pm -10 pm   Reception (i.e. party)<br>
          Saturday, May 3   10 am - 5 pm   Sessions<br>
          Sunday, May 4     10 am - 5 pm   Sessions<br>
<p>
Dinners are self-assembling.  Weather will probably be sunny, in the 70s<br>
(F) or possibly the 80s.  Accommodation arrangements should be made<br>
directly with the hotel; request hotel information when you contact us.<br>
<p>
We hope to see as many of you as possible.  This is shaping up to be an<br>
extremely enjoyable meeting.<br>
