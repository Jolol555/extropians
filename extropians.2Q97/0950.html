I think a "Practical Extropian Resource Guide" would be a good thing.  It would help <br>
extropians and other people find what they want (if it exists) much faster.<br>
<p>
I'm going to compile a list of resources that I find relevant to the extropian ideal of <br>
self-transformation.  I'll surf the Web in search of information and will accept URLs <br>
that people will send me.<br>
<p>
However, since I'm quite busy these days, I'll probably unsubscribe from this mailing <br>
list at the end of this week (I can't keep up with all the messages I get from all the <br>
mailing lists I'm on).  You will still be able to send me URLs at <br>
&lt;litenite@game-master.com&gt;.  Also because I'm busy, don't expect my compilation to be <br>
extremely voluminous nor present on the Web before the end of the month.<br>
