*BBZZZZTTTT!!!*  Thank you for playing.<br>
<p>
<p>
Were you there? I was. <br>
<p>
<p>
The bundle was only about 4 million. Nothing like the bundle spent on, for instance, the PenPoint OS. Which shipped. three versions. And died at the hands of players like AT&amp;T and massive market indifference. I was close at hand for that, too.<br>
<p>
<p>
The only really blue-sky part of Xanadu was cultural, not technological.<br>
<p>
This is distinct from "handwaving". Xanadu did have that--but Silicon Valley has no shortage of either... or hadn't you noticed?<br>
<p>
<p>
The retrenching of AutoDesk was done after John Walker left the company. John still thinks that xanalogical hypertext publishing has value--see his Web site for clues. <br>
<p>
<p>
ACAD is now taking a beating in their "core business". <br>
<p>
<p>
And the Web has between 2 and 4 terabytes of storage (according to a few estimates), and it still doesn't even have bidirectional links, for crying out loud--but "blue-sky" tech like the massively-parallel Inktome indexing engine keeps people dumb and happy. <br>
<p>
<p>
The Xanies had more than one blind spot. But comparing enfilades to nanotech is like comparing a new motor oil additive to controlled cost-effective matter-antimatter power.<br>
<p>
<p>
MMB, <br>
<p>
who really ought to write a book about this stuff <br>
<p>
just to spit in the eye of the self-appointed historians of Xanadu.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;John Walker of Autodesk, a successful CAD company, got interested in</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;nanotech and other Drexlerian ideas back in the 1980's.  The company lost</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;a bundle on Xanadu, the Drexler-influenced hypertext publishing project.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(See Ed Regis' "Nano" for more on Drexler &amp; Xanadu.)  Eventually they</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;had to retrench and focus on their core business instead of these blue</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;sky ideas.</i><br>
