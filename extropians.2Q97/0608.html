Recently I requested from the participants of  this  list, any and all<br>
information  available here on the net  which  members could provided =<br>
<p>
to me in assisting  in my recuperation from my recent heart attack. To<br>
those of you who responded, Thank You, but I must admit I was surprised<br>
at the  list=92s  general indifference to my plight. I should have known<br>
that  discourse on God, the lack of God, the existent of God, requires<br>
the total commitment of all the available neurons of the  members of<br>
this list.  Let me help you in your discourse, first you must have a<br>
heart  attack,  then go to any major hospital=92s  ER, and  lastly  you =<br>
<p>
must believe that death is only 5 feet behind you, and gaining with each<br>
second that passes.  After that, you might reprogram  your discussions<br>
concerning God. =<br>
<p>
<p>
You remind me of what  President L. Johnson once said in his description<br>
of the Washington Press Corp.<br>
=93 I wish one of those Bastards had run for Dog Catcher. before coming t=<br>
o<br>
this town=94   =<br>
<p>
<p>
I don=92t contribute to this or any other list,  only because I have<br>
nothing to contribute, this is either caused by the lack of knowledge or<br>
the fear of  an intellectual discourse with people more glib and more<br>
intelligent than myself.<br>
<p>
I can not teach, all I can do it learn.<br>
<p>
But, I have now something to say.  A new drug  lipitor, approved by the<br>
FDA 12/6/96.  If you take it should  lower your  lipids by 50%. Drug  =<br>
<p>
has been available in Europe but not here in USA.<br>
<p>
Concerning  my  smoking, I  have been smoke free since 01/01/97. =<br>
<p>
<p>
I have used the NQ system, commonly referred to as the patch  among us<br>
smokers.  Although this system was a  excellent  aid while quitting, you<br>
must be Very careful with it=92s use.  It was a direct contributor to my<br>
visit to the  ER.   After smoking over 40 years, I had narrowed my<br>
arteries, but  was not experiencing ill health.<br>
<p>
With the patch , I was able to quit smoking, but the strength of the<br>
dose had  narrowed the arteries more that smoking two packs a day.  I<br>
did not experience pain in the chest caused by this narrowing, instead I<br>
had a  referred pain in the left shoulder.   The Doc said I had =<br>
<p>
strained a muscle , and with proper rest this pain would disappear. =<br>
<p>
That was on Monday, Tuesday I was in the ER.<br>
<p>
So my contribution to this list is,  If you quit smoking and use any<br>
aid, gum or patch, you must assume that any pain, repeat any pain, must<br>
be assumed to be heart related.  Second, for those you who have a high<br>
lipid count, try lipitor, it works better than Bran muffins.<br>
<p>
