Subject: fx-discuss: GRBr: New Caltech news release<br>
<p>
This news release, which was issued minutes ago by Caltech, bears directly<br>
on claim GRBr. It reports results that argue strongly for a very distant<br>
origin for at least one gamma-ray burster.<br>

<i>&gt;For Immediate Release	May 14, 1997</i><br>

<i>&gt;Caltech Astronomers Crack the Puzzle of Cosmic Gamma-Ray Bursts</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;PASADENA-A team of Caltech astronomers has pinpointed a gamma-ray burst</i><br>
<i>&gt;several billion light-years away from the Milky Way.  The team was following</i><br>
<i>&gt;up on a discovery made by the Italian/Dutch satellite BeppoSAX.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The results demonstrate for the first time that at least some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;enigmatic gamma-ray bursts that have puzzled astronomers for decades are</i><br>
<i>&gt;extragalactic in origin.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The team has announced the results in the International Astronomical Union</i><br>
<i>&gt;Circular, which is the primary means by which astronomers alert their</i><br>
<i>&gt;colleagues of transient phenomena.  The results will be published in</i><br>
<i>&gt;scientific journals at a later date.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mark Metzger, a Caltech astronomy professor , said he was thrilled by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;result.  "When I finished analyzing the spectrum and saw features, I knew we</i><br>
<i>&gt;had finally caught it.  It was a stunning moment of revelation. Such events</i><br>
<i>&gt;happen only a few times in the life of a scientist." </i><br>
<i>&gt;According to Dr. Shri Kulkarni, an astronomy professor at Caltech and another</i><br>
<i>&gt;team member,  gamma-ray bursts occur a couple of times a day.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt;brilliant flashes seem to appear from random directions in space and</i><br>
<i>&gt;typically last a few seconds.</i><br>
<i>&gt;"After hunting clues to these bursts for so many years, we now know that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;bursts are in fact incredibly energetic events," said Kulkarni.</i><br>
<i>&gt;For team member and astronomy professor George Djorgovski, "Gamma-ray bursts</i><br>
<i>&gt;are one of the great mysteries of science.  It is wonderful to contribute to</i><br>
<i>&gt;its unraveling." </i><br>
<i>&gt;The bursts of high-energy radiation were first discovered by military</i><br>
<i>&gt;satellites almost 30 years ago, but so far their origin has remained a</i><br>
<i>&gt;mystery.  New information came in recent years from NASA's Compton Gamma-Ray</i><br>
<i>&gt;Observatory satellite, which has so far detected several thousand bursts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nonetheless, the fundamental question of where the bursts came from remained</i><br>
<i>&gt;unanswered.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Competing theories on gamma-ray bursts generally fall into two types: one,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which supposes the bursts to originate from some as-yet unknown population of</i><br>
<i>&gt;objects within our own Milky Way galaxy, and another, which proposes that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;bursts originate in distant galaxies, several billion light-years away.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt;the latter (as was indirectly supported by the Compton Observatory's</i><br>
<i>&gt;observations), then the bursts are among the most violent and brilliant</i><br>
<i>&gt;events in the universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Progress in understanding the nature of the bursts was stymied by the fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that until recently the bursts were detected as very high-energy gamma rays. </i><br>
<i>&gt;It is difficult to focus gamma rays, and thus the positional accuracy of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;bursts was quite crude, leaving astronomers with thousands of faints stars</i><br>
<i>&gt;and galaxies as potential "hosts."</i><br>
<i>&gt;An important recent development was the deployment of BeppoSAX, a joint</i><br>
<i>&gt;Italian/Dutch satellite launched in late 1996 by the Italian space agency. </i><br>
<i>&gt;This satellite, for the first time, provided a rapid and accurate position in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the sky for strong gamma-ray bursts. This enabled astronomers to search for</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible visible and radio counterparts using telescopes on the ground.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;first such counterpart was detected at the beginning of May, but faded away</i><br>
<i>&gt;before its nature could be established.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The satellite detected another burst on May 8, and Caltech astronomers were</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to bring telescopes at Palomar Observatory to bear within a few hours. </i><br>
<i>&gt;The Caltech team noticed a starlike object that was changing brightness in an</i><br>
<i>&gt;unusual fashion at the position of the burst .  Dr. Howard Bond of the Space</i><br>
<i>&gt;Telescope Science Institute initially reported the object based on his</i><br>
<i>&gt;measurements at Kitt Peak National Observatory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The crucial piece to the puzzle was finally found by the Caltech team on May</i><br>
<i>&gt;11 using one of the two W.M. Keck 10-meter telescopes, the world's largest,</i><br>
<i>&gt;on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  The variable object showed characteristic features in</i><br>
<i>&gt;its spectrum, known to originate in intergalactic clouds.  By measuring the</i><br>
<i>&gt;wavelengths of these features, the Caltech astronomers were able to measure</i><br>
<i>&gt;the distance to a gamma-ray burst for the first time.  Their measurements</i><br>
<i>&gt;place the burst at a distance of several billion light-years, over one half</i><br>
<i>&gt;the size of the observable universe.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Recent observations from the telescopes at Palomar show that this star-like</i><br>
<i>&gt;object is fading away.  As such rapid fading had been seen with the burst in</i><br>
<i>&gt;March, the Caltech astronomers had to make an extra effort to identify this</i><br>
<i>&gt;counterpart quickly so that the Keck observations could be carried out when</i><br>
<i>&gt;the object was bright.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The discovery is a major step to help scientists understand the nature of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;burst's origin.  We now know that for a few seconds the burst was over a</i><br>
<i>&gt;million times brighter than an entire galaxy.  No other phenomena are known</i><br>
<i>&gt;that produce this much energy in such a short time.  Thus, while the</i><br>
<i>&gt;observations have settled the question of whether the bursts come from</i><br>
<i>&gt;cosmological distances, their physical mechanism remains shrouded in mystery.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Caltech team, in addition to Metzger, Kulkarni, and Djorgovski, consists</i><br>
<i>&gt;of professor Charles Steidel, postdoctoral scholars Steven Odewahn and Debra</i><br>
<i>&gt;Shepherd, and graduate students Kurt Adelberger, Roy Gal, and Michael Pahre. </i><br>
<i>&gt;The team also includes Dr. Dale Frail of the National Radio Astronomy</i><br>
<i>&gt;Observatory in Socorro, New Mexico.</i><br>
