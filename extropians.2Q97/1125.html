Hi to all on the list, including Max.  My friend Sterling Tardie in Eugene,<br>
Oregon, would very much like to work for either the Extropy Institute, or any<br>
Extropy related business or company.  He is willing to work for either at<br>
least $7 per hour or more, or just for food, housing, local transportation,<br>
and a little spending money.  He is a hard worker, and would like to get to<br>
California, but needs to have a job lined up first.  I told him I'd let the<br>
list know, to see if it could help.  He's 22, pretty smart, loyal and has<br>
pretty good computer skills, although I don't think he knows any computer<br>
languages.  Please respond to the list if you have any positions available.<br>
 I'll forward the info to him.  Thanks.  Shawn M. Johnson<br>
