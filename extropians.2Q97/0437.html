<p>
You could start by:<br>
   1.  provide a list of funding sources for research for stopping the <br>
aging process in human beings.  That would include <br>
	A. Government funding<br>
	B. Corporate funding<br>
	C. Foundation funding<br>
    The sources would be people who have already committed funds or <br>
public support for such objectives (stopping aging).  Their expertise <br>
would be combined for a massive collective grass roots effort.<br>
<p>
   2. find authority sources in the biotechnological fields who could<br>
write and outline a specific research plan that would be acceptable to the<br>
funding sources without seeming like an unrealistic dream (like UFO's and<br>
time travel).  The proposals would need to be credible enough to be<br>
accepted by the general population. <br>
<p>
  3. recruit marketing and promotional personnel to get these <br>
objectives moving.<br>
<p>
  4. coordinate a massive world-wide volunteer effort to support these <br>
activities<br>
