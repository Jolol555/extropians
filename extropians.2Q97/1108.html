Here's a data point: for a while I lived in a group house where we legalized<br>
nudity by concensus.  When someone moved in who found it objectionable, we<br>
stopped.  It was never a big deal.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; The question is whether recent historical trends are a one-time</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; multiple equilibria, and other contextual effects.  Maybe both the very</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; prudish and the routinely nude cultures are self-consistent equilibria</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in certain contexts.  But most of human history has been between these</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; extremes, and so absent a reason to expect some fundamentally new</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; development, I'd expect future culture to also lie within historical</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ranges.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Note that historical ranges include primitive cultures which are, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;our purposes, nudists, although they wouldn't think of themselves as</i><br>
<i>&gt;such.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm also not very sure about the "cycles" notion. European and North</i><br>
<i>&gt;American body modesty mores have pretty much remained on the "prudish"</i><br>
<i>&gt;side of the line from the fall of Rome until the last century. Thats a</i><br>
<i>&gt;very long cycle indeed! I suspect that the primacy of Christianity had</i><br>
<i>&gt;more to do with it than "natural cycles".</i><br>
<p>
I seem to recall that public nudity was unremarkable in western Europe until<br>
roughly 1500.  Not that people went around all day in the nude, but it would<br>
not be unreasonable to happen upon someone bathing or changing clothes in<br>
public.  That's my recollection of what I read a while ago in "The History<br>
of Manners" by Norbert Elias.  Unfortunatey, I read that in the first<br>
volume, and now when I look on my bookshelves, I can only find the ^#^%&amp;<br>
second volume.  <br>
