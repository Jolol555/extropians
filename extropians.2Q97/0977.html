<p>
That is clearer to a wider audience, but at the expense of more words.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It seems to me that your discussion must be limited to two experts who </i><br>
<i>&gt;can agree on the context of the problem being addressed.  An expert </i><br>
<i>&gt;and a non-expert would not share the common background information </i><br>
<i>&gt;that would make application to the discussion of additional evidence </i><br>
<i>&gt;practical with Bayesian techniques.</i><br>
<p>
My model applies to *any* situation where any two agents disagree<br>
about some factual claim, as long as they understand what that claim<br>
means.  They do not need to share any understanding of other context.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Are these computational limitations you speak of the situation where </i><br>
<i>&gt;one party may not have the time or temperament to perform a complete </i><br>
<i>&gt;or correct inductive analysis?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Or, is one party simply unfamiliar with the formal analysis approach </i><br>
<i>&gt;and unable to *formulate* the necessary computation?</i><br>
<p>
The model applies to both of these cases.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;So, on the other hand, are you trying to show, vis a vis what Curt </i><br>
<i>&gt;said, that normal "memetic replication" actually *does* end up </i><br>
<i>&gt;equating to "a passable approximation of Bayesian inference"?</i><br>
<p>
I cited a paper which indicated that evolutionary pressures reward<br>
closer approximations to Bayesian reasoning, ignoring the<br>
computational costs.  In situations where those costs are small, then<br>
a passable approximation is expected.  When the costs are large, the<br>
divergence should be larger.  How much larger is hard to say.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It's not that I (or the average person) want(s) to ignore expert </i><br>
<i>&gt;opinions, it is simply that we can not make any use of them if they </i><br>
<i>&gt;can not put into terms we can understand. </i><br>
<p>
Consider debates on the effect of diet on lifespan, on the effect of<br>
capital punishment on murder rates, the effect of military budgets on<br>
deterring war, or on the age of the universe.  Most everyone can<br>
understand what these claims mean, even if they couldn't understand<br>
most arguments about them.  What debates do you have in mind?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;P.S. For those who might be interested, there is a descent overview </i><br>
<i>&gt;called "A Short Exposition on Bayesian Inference and Probability" by </i><br>
<i>&gt;John Stutz &amp; Peter Cheeseman at</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://ic-www.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/bayes-group/group/html/bayes-the">http://ic-www.arc.nasa.gov/ic/projects/bayes-group/group/html/bayes-the</a>  </i><br>

Btw, I used to work with John and Peter.<br>
