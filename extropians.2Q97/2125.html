So you say that computing power and high quality information are the<br>

The computer is just a machine, the information is the raw material. The<br>

And why should any posthuman entity talk to non-posthuman entities?<br>

<i>&gt;  &gt; Posthuman entities, if there are several ones and no collective (whereas</i><br>

<i>&gt;  &gt; each other to get results. But they will not demand money for them,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; because whenever they give knowledge, they don't lose it.</i><br>

<i>&gt; This would be very nice if it were possible to carry out computation</i><br>

<i>&gt; simpler.</i><br>
<p>
High-quality information is the only *scarce* resource. One planet, one<br>
solar space station, provides enough energy for a posthuman think tank.<br>
The sensors will need some more but it will never get into the area of<br>
scarcity. This trend is visible even today. Look at the internet. OK, it<br>
needs some energy with all those computers and telephone lines, but it's<br>
a HUGE information storage, even without nanotechnology, and it doesn't<br>
take any considerable part of this planet's total energy.<br>

<i>&gt; When you give me an apple and I give you an orange, and this happens</i><br>
<i>&gt; voluntarily, then you have an orange (which you prefer to an apple)</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I have an apple (which I prefer to an orange).  We both benefit,</i><br>
<i>&gt; positive sum game, and furthermore because our act (a transaction)</i><br>
<i>&gt; has infinitesimally affected the market price of apples and oranges,</i><br>
<i>&gt; we have anonymously transmitted some information to the world about</i><br>
<i>&gt; our relative preferences for apples and oranges. There's an</i><br>
<i>&gt; information-communication feat very difficult to pull off reliably</i><br>
<i>&gt; in an engineered system.</i><br>
<p>
Problem number one is, as I already said, that I think posthumans will<br>
only appear as collectives. If you assume that there is something like a<br>
"meaning of life", then all posthumans will proabably search for it and<br>
act like a collective.<br>
<p>
Problem number two is that money is simply dispensable. If you assume<br>
that there aren't collectives but individuals, you must also accept that<br>
there is nothing like a "meaning of life" or that not everyone wants to<br>
search for it. In this case, every posthuman has different interests. It<br>
is likely, or "probably unavoidable", that those with the same interests<br>
will form collectives _again_.<br>
<p>
If you think a world with several posthuman individuals is likely,<br>
similar to today's world just with cleverer inhabitants, you must<br>
consider that other posthuman collectives might be worried about this.<br>
For those high-powered individuals might destroy information sources the<br>
collectives need. In this case, the individuals would be "assimilated". <br>
<p>
If posthumans leave the collective for a while to gather information<br>
separately, and they meet other posthumans, they will try to find out<br>
their interests, and if they are equal again, they will probably join.<br>
<p>
And for the exchange between several different collectives: that's the<br>
same like exchange between individuals. Assimilation or ignorance. Only<br>
in very few cases it will work like "I tell you this, you tell me that",<br>
or "Give me 10$ (!!!) and I will tell you this, for with the 10 $ I can<br>
buy that other information from the posthuman guy next door, positive<br>
sum game, but consider inflation, too".<br>
<p>
Nobody needs a money-based economy.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; As for the rest, it sounds like an argument against institutions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of intellectual property such as copyrights, patents, and trademarks,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I've already expressed my doubts about such restrictions on</i><br>
<i>&gt; information exchange in this forum previously. I can't think of</i><br>
<i>&gt; any good way to refute Lee Daniel Crocker's arguments on this point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Right now, I think it's a bit theoretical, since gummints are still</i><br>
<i>&gt; running around shooting, bombing, and kidnapping people for even</i><br>
<i>&gt; more obviously innocent actions than giving someone a "free" copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; of some Microsoft product.</i><br>
<p>
And you bet that Microsoft would run around shooting and bombing<br>
(kidnapping would be too expensive) people in a "UIF" world. OK, that's<br>
exaggeration, but it is obvious that they would develop some nasty<br>
tricks to stop illegal copying.<br>
<p>
The government is not the evil player in our world's game. It's those<br>
who are supporting it, the big industry and the banks, who are "evil" in<br>
the sense that their actions endanger mankind. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You claim that you have no interest whatsoever in making any use</i><br>
<i>&gt; of knowledge?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Don't you want to use your knowledge to help all the poor and</i><br>
<i>&gt; suffering people on this planet?</i><br>
<p>
I'm no posthuman. I have ethical interests, but any posthuman wouldn't<br>
have such interests. If a posthuman had a "lifesaving ideology", wanting<br>
to save as much life as possible, it would have to fill the entire<br>
universe with life, and even more, it would even have to "turn off"<br>
death in every single lifeform, thus gaining maximum lifespace.<br>
<p>
In order to reach posthumanity [as soon as possible], we must avoid the<br>
destruction of our home planet. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I hope that the above two questions have made it clear that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; have yet to adequately explain the difference between knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; and power, and that you have yet to adequately defend yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt; from the charge of using empty rhetoric. If you expect me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe that you do not seek to ever use any of the knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; you obtain (for instance, you will not use your knowledge in</i><br>
<i>&gt; order to obtain more knowledge), I'll hope you'll pardon me in</i><br>
<i>&gt; saying that I'm just not that gullible.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not saying that I don't want to use knowledge. Using knowledge is<br>
what I do every day. I say that any posthuman entity has no interest<br>
whatsoever in using knowledge, except for obtaining more knowledge (so<br>
the knowledge is just a BASIS [upon which new knowledge is placed] or a<br>
TOOL [for instance to build special external sensors], but never [or<br>
rarely] a CURRENCY).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What you want is power to help the poor and suffering: stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; pretending otherwise. You mean to rule wisely and well, but you</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean to rule.</i><br>
<p>
I don't want to rule. I want the rulers to rule better.<br>
