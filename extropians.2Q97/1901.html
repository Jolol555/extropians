<p>
I suppose I wasn't specific enough.  IQ is thing measured by IQ tests.  <br>
It has a correlation to some forms of intelligence in some groups but is <br>
not the same thing as intelligence.  When I say I don't think IQ above <br>
a certain level is meaningful I mean that I do not think the tests are <br>
very reliably correlated to intelligence above certain scores.  I don't<br>
think we are approaching some upper limit on intelligence or the parts<br>
of intelligence most useful for making money.<br>
<p>
IQ tests measure factors other that those used for generating income.<br>
As a wild guess I would say there is a set of normal curves that make<br>
up IQ and it is progressively unlikely for a person to be at the upper <br>
end of larger numbers of them (though you may be able to use some forms<br>
of intelligence to develop others).  Some of these curves are related to <br>
income but once a person reaches a high number in several of those it <br>
is more likely that additional IQ increases are in other areas.  These <br>
are genetic and cultural curves that can be changed by genetic <br>
engineering, smart drugs, and better training methods and don't apply <br>
to AIs.<br>
<p>
Certainly there are things other than intelligence that affect income.<br>
I would guess there are factors that serve as limits, thresholds, <br>
multipliers, and inverted Us.  There is also the match of individual <br>
traits and skills to environments.  Over time there is more of a chance <br>
that a rarely used talent will be of value.  Also there are many rewards <br>
to a person not normally classed as income.  It could be that higher <br>
IQs encourage the seeking of more diverse forms of reward but that over <br>
time it becomes more likely that someone with a high IQ will eventually <br>
become interested in income and focus on it.<br>
<p>
This is one of those areas that seems like it would be a lot more<br>
informative with some data and a spreadsheet or some simulations,<br>
but I can't think of anything I would do with the answers if I had<br>
them.  There is a lot of demand for intelligence testing and predicting<br>
success at various things though.<br>
<p>
If we took a thousand Marilyn vos Savants and a thousand Bill Gateses<br>
and left them alone for a thousand years who would end up with the<br>
higher IQ, who would end up with the most money and who would have<br>
the most fun?  From my rough perspective of history the people with the<br>
highest IQs have not been the richest but they have done well.  The<br>
people with the most money have not been the brightest but they were<br>
not dummies.  I am not sure who has had more fun or if it is not some<br>
third group.  I think given enough time the brightest ones would end<br>
up being the richest ones.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Over all I find it hard to imagine a futere where income inqualities</i><br>
<i>&gt;are not much greater than they are now.  </i><br>
<p>
My guess would be that most people will get richer but the rich and<br>
the smart will get richer faster.  Many people are however more<br>
concerned with relative wealth than absolute wealth.  It makes a lot<br>
of sense if you are competing for mates or survival but is less<br>
important if you just want to have fun in a relatively peaceful<br>
environment.<br>
