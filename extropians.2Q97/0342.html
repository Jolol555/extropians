<p>
What are you doing to help?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Transhumans, extropians, metamorphosists, and cryonicists unite!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You could also have included the CRSociety, and Longevity-digest lists</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the sci.cryonics and sci.life-extension newsgroups.</i><br>
<p>
Thank you.<br>
I'm sorry I did not have their addresses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;While they all want indefinitely extended life-span (although I am not</i><br>
<i>&gt;sure this is true of all transhumanists)</i><br>
<p>
If they do not want to live <br>
let us try to help them love life so much <br>
they will change their minds.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Any who place faith in same belief and practice as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I support my cause and I should treat with respect and friendship.</i><br>
A friend to life is a friend of mine.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I do not want to be unknown person posting messages!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Let us know who we are!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We probably do not know each other; that does not help us.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Tell me who you are; I want to know you.</i><br>
Let us help know each other through each other.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;message correspondence is a first step in getting to know someone.</i><br>
<p>
I have talked to many who I will never see again; <br>
I am SHAMED I let that chance of friendship pass by.<br>
A person willing to communicate is worth having as a friend forever.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;getting to know someone better can have a negative effect. </i><br>
<p>
Never!<br>
If I understand someone I can only love them <br>
enough to forgive them any thing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Let us know what you think should be done, what need be done.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What are your problems?.</i><br>
What can I do for you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Tell me what you want;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;if I were your slave for life what would I do?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would rebuke your efforts and ask you to set yourself *free*.</i><br>
<p>
I am free to slave.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Help me help you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can help me best, by becoming convinced of my priorities and doing,</i><br>
<i>&gt;in your own best way, whatever you can to further them as a free person</i><br>
<i>&gt;and an associate.</i><br>
<p>
Friend, tell me more of your priorities. <br>
Let the world know what you would have it do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Let us get organized to do more than talk, to control our lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Let us work together and cooperate.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What are we doing?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I learn and teach; I want to learn what you want me to teach you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge I desire cannot be taught.</i><br>
<p>
You must learn from somewhere,<br>
taught by nature, <br>
taught by god,<br>
taught by teachers,<br>
taught by me,<br>
taught by you.<br>
Be taught and learn.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;though there is no thing I can not do if I try hard enough.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If a number of us "try hard enough" </i><br>
<i>&gt;with all our other positive attributes, </i><br>
<i>&gt;we may succeed in vastly extending our lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What can we not do?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I can not be immortal yet and it makes me sad, afraid, and angry,</i><br>
but I will NOT let that stop me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Let us learn how we could do it, then do it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We need a plan;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;if you listen to me I will give you one.</i><br>
Listen to me, <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you will be led;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Sit on your ass,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you will be dead.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;You choose and you choose now!</i><br>
I choose life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This sounds like the "come-on" of a guru/cult-leader</i><br>
<p>
Am I "coming-on" to a cult?<br>
If you do not know what to do I will help YOU decide.<br>
I want to help get us where we want to be. <br>
Leader or not, here I come!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;If I get one person motivated and bring their brain to life </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;we will be one step closer to our goals.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;True if their brain is not already alive. However, this might be taken</i><br>
<i>&gt;as an insult to many of us whose brains *are* alive.</i><br>
<p>
OK friend, how's this?<br>
If I get one person motivated and bring their brain *more* to life <br>
we will be one step closer to our goals.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;WAKE up!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are DYING!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Our DNA is being TORN APART by free radicals!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Bacteria, virus, and fungus are DEVOURING our cells!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We are eating TOXINS!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;People are STARVING!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;People are KILLING each other and themselves!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Natural DISASTER is known world-wide!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Let us prepare to explain to others <br>
how these and other things can be stopped.<br>
If everyone ate controlled calorie restricted diets <br>
we would be fighting at least 3 of those problems <br>
free radicals, toxins, and starvation,<br>
as well as living longer.<br>
