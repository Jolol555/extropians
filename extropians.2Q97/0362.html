<i>&gt; Lee Daniel Crocker:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The fact that reader attention is valuable and posting is free leads </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to an obovious tragedy of the commons that the proposal helps solve. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It may be obvious to you, but it is not obvious to me.  Many of us on </i><br>
<i>&gt; the Internet subscribe to ten or more lists and have learned to </i><br>
<i>&gt; manage the postings quite effectively with our email software.  I </i><br>
<i>&gt; don't believe in restricting bandwidth to any participant in any </i><br>
<i>&gt; manner, because there is plenty of room for everyone and we all </i><br>
<i>&gt; possess filters and delete keys.  I can zap fifteen posts or more at </i><br>
<i>&gt; one keystroke if I want to, I don't grudge the ten seconds that takes </i><br>
<i>&gt; to anyone.</i><br>
<p>
I subscribe to 30, and get about 2MB of mail a day.  I've learned<br>
to use my software, and to judge in a second or two whether a post<br>
might be worth reading.  But I still value my time, and I believe<br>
that a two-tiered system like that I have proposed, with an open<br>
list and a self-limited paid list, would increase my ability to<br>
find interesting things, because I would be less inclined to skip<br>
postings on the paid list.  If I knew somebody thought it was<br>
important enough to pay for, I'd be inclined to spend more than<br>
a second or two to find out why, whereas on an open list I have<br>
less patience for anything I don't see an immediate benefit to.<br>
<p>
I am glad you are generous with your time, and will give anyone<br>
those ten seconds of attention.  But /my/ time is not yours to<br>
spend, and it is clear to me from talking with others that they<br>
value their time as well, and want to make it more productive.<br>
<p>
You seem to be under the impression that bandwidth-limiting by<br>
self-restraint is a kind of control.  Nonsense.  The proposal I<br>
have made is entirely voluntary and unmoderated.  It is a way<br>
for list participants to voluntarily select those things that<br>
might be more valuable for them to spend their time on.  If you<br>
want to listen to the unpaid list, no one will stop you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From my perspective, having to make an accounting of my resources </i><br>
<i>&gt; every single time I post to a list renders that process more complex </i><br>
<i>&gt; and timeconsuming.  It is clear to me that your goal is to limit the </i><br>
<i>&gt; voices on this list, and I refuse to buy into that concept.  </i><br>
<p>
That is a slanderous and baseless accusation.  You don't have a clue<br>
who I am; that I don't have any personal killfiles, that I have<br>
lobbied against the moderation of Usenet groups; that I have fought<br>
against all legislation of email.  Yet you accuse me of wanting to<br>
limit the voices on the list when I propose a system that anyone<br>
with two working brain cells can see isn't capable of that.  Thank<br>
you, at least, for giving me information with which I can evaluate<br>
the likely intellectual merit and honesty of your future posts.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; To me, it is vitally important that persons be encouraged to post </i><br>
<i>&gt; more than they do, because so many wonderful ideas and thoughts are </i><br>
<i>&gt; not getting heard here.  </i><br>
<p>
In my two-tiered proposal (did you even read it or are you just<br>
reacting to your personal guess about my motives?) I suspect that<br>
newcomers will be /more/ likely to post to the general list than<br>
they are now, if they know that it is encouraged, and that there<br>
is not even the existing social pressure against it.  I know I<br>
have restrained myself from sending some messages for fear of<br>
generating too much traffic that I would gladly post to the unpaid<br>
list if I were assured that I would not burden those uninterested.<br>
<p>
We both respect the ideas of others, and we both want them posted<br>
and discussed.  I also respect their /time/, and do not wish to<br>
impose a single Procrustean bed of rules on participants, but offer<br>
them a choice. <br>
