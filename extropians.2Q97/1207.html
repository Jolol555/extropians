<i>&gt; Hmm, critical developmental periods for music? Might be true. My</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggestion is to avoid playing just Mozart, and play a wide variety</i><br>
<i>&gt; of music styles so that the child can learn to understand them. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have found that it takes some time to truly "get" music one is</i><br>
<i>&gt; unfamilliar with, and before that it is hard to perceive its beauty.</i><br>
<p>
	We agree.  Our musical library is considered VERY eclectic.  The<br>
information we received, though brief, reported increased results on tests<br>
when children studied with Mozart, or listened to Mozart prior to taking<br>
tests.  Which indicates the importance of music in that area.  We have<br>
experienced other effects of different styles of music, and have found them<br>
useful for various reasons.  Here in Switzerland, Music Therapy is<br>
recognized as useful for a variety of problems, including various learning<br>
disabilities.  As an "L.D." (learning disabled or late developer) we are<br>
perhaps more sensitive to such discoveries.  We are also more sensitive to<br>
our own mental development. <br>
	If children are exposed to all styles of music, they will benefit from<br>
whatever each style has to offer.  They cannot help but be enriched by the<br>
experience.<br>
	On another note....(we bet we get away with this....changing topics in the<br>
middle of the missive...) we loved the essay Max wrote about EDO.  It was<br>
very near a program we presented to a mystical convention and it was<br>
received with overwhelming concurance.  As we have pointed out before, the<br>
mystics we have been in contact with are very pro-individual<br>
responsibility, encourage questioning all that you have been "programmed"<br>
with by government agents or religious agents, operate on the meme that one<br>
must know oneself before they can hope to be their own master, one must<br>
make decisions when one is not operating in an emotional state, one needs<br>
to realize that abundance is available to all, it is simply a matter of<br>
focusing ones attention and action to the goal, etc.  The point being, we<br>
have noted a bigoted attitude towards myticism on this list and we<br>
understand it.  We also know that there are many "mystics" which are full<br>
of shit and are playing their particular game for the bucks....which is a<br>
pretty good yardstick for sincerity.  But, the vast majority of mystics we<br>
have encountered have so many of the traits of Extropians that they would<br>
make you blush...if that was possible.  Perhaps what we are getting at is<br>
there are more people leaning towards Extro thinking than most Extros know<br>
about.  Perhaps it is because there is an attitude amongst some Extros,<br>
much like religious-freaks, that one must believe in the whole package or<br>
be rejected as a heretic.  Many people embrace parts of the Extro view and<br>
could embrace more, if they were invited in a non-threatening way.<br>
Certainly they are open to discussion, we have found.<br>
