Carl Feynman:<br>
<i>&gt; There are lots of urban legends out there about great inventions that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been suppressed by The Powers That Be.  In these stories, They seem to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; threats, media blackouts, and murders that look like accidents.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to believe that all such stories are bunk.  However, there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; another way to suppress an invention: licence the patent, and then don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacture it.  This is entirely legal, though people don't tend to talk</i><br>
<i>&gt; about it, as it is anti-social.</i><br>
<p>
As always, there's a bright side: all patents are public, so while<br>
you can't legally make profit from the patent, you can always build<br>
the device for your own use.  I wonder if developing and publishing<br>
a GNU design from such a patent would be punishable by law...<br>
<p>
Also, this tactic essentially means giving the technology away to<br>
about half of all the world's countries: the ones that don't enforce<br>
or care about patent laws.  You're going to go after that<br>
government-backed company in China that's making money off your<br>
patent?  Yeah, right.  Ask Microsoft for advice. :)<br>
