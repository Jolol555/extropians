	This question is easy enough to answer, at least in females of the human<br>
species.  Menopause actually helps genes in a primitive setting because the<br>
female is able to participate in activities that help the survival of grand<br>
children and other relatives (remember the whole tribe is related).  Old<br>
members of tribes (male or female, but usually female because they live<br>
longer) are also valuable because they have a great deal of knowledge.  The<br>
lived through that hurricane fifty years ago so they know how to survive<br>
the next one.  They know what plants can be eaten when the staple food is<br>
unavailable.  It would be most unfortunate if this knowledge was lost in<br>
child birth.<br>
	It's important to remember that organisms can affect the survival of their<br>
genes after they have reproduced.  This can be a force for extending life<br>
spans.  The fact that certain things help in early life during the<br>
reproductive years hurt in later life (for example, limited cell divisions<br>
as a prevention of cancer and perhaps faster growth at the expense of<br>
sustainability) is possibly more responsible for death, at least among<br>
humans, than uselessness to genes.  Evolution is a balancing act where<br>
benefits must be weighed against costs, and the end result is the life span<br>
we have now.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The real mystery then is why genes allow the reproductive period to stop</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than working harder to extend fertility.  Actually men are often</i><br>
<i>&gt; fertile into their 60's and even beyond, so this discard-the-body theory</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't explain why so many symptoms of aging show up before then.</i><br>
