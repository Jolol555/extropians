Sorry, Mike, but I think there are several weak points in your analysis. <br>
For one, I consider excluding carbon dioxide a sleight of hand. We haven't<br>
even begun our first steps towards a zero overall CO_2 release energy<br>
economy (i.e. photovoltaics, hydrogen, and methanol from<br>
biomass/carbonates). That exponentially rising atmospheric greenhouse gas<br>
content is a gamble, is not open to doubt. Antarctic palaeoice samples<br>
show our climate to be intrinsically nonlinear, and we are giving it major<br>
shove. How's that for a global experiment.  Globally stupid. <br>
<p>
Earlier sources of pollution, starting with medieval metallurgy, were<br>
intense, but localized. As local wood, ore, and energy sources were<br>
depleted, we started to forage overseas. Now we are the heart of the<br>
furnace, the focus of material streams converging from all around the<br>
globe. At the origin, in the underdeveloped countries, there is zero<br>
environment protection, the wages are very low so only a tiny fraction of<br>
the cake remains there. We are skimming the cream off the global milk<br>
bowl, in more than one aspect. <br>
<p>
This effect is only sustainable, as long there is milk in the bowl, and<br>
the world is not equilibrated, underdeveloped world patches ready to take<br>
the olympic fire of industrialization still exist. But both the patches<br>
are running out, and the milk is progresively turning sour by the<br>
equilibration metabolites. A 1 GPeople to join the happy-select-few-throng<br>
will produce a _lot_ of metabolites. Sustainability of progress?<br>
<p>
I say: let's turn our eyes to sky. The Mother of all Milkbowls: Galactica.<br>
Let's move industrialization into orbital factories, us following on the <br>
heel. Autoreplicating systems are cheap, and there are lots of <br>
unequilibrated matter/energy patches out there.   Let's.<br>

<i>&gt; The turnaround point is somewhere around a per capital income level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; $8,000.00 per year. Once you get to that point as a nation, your average</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal pollution goes down.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Extrapolating this, considering that gamma rays are about the nastiest</i><br>
<i>&gt; form of pollution one could produce, I highly doubt that a highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; advanced civilization would be party to widespread pollution of parsecs</i><br>
<i>&gt; of space by gamma ray bursts.</i><br>
