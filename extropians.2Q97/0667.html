<i>&gt; In a message dated 97-04-25 20:03:02 EDT, you write:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;&lt; Remember, you need to make that hydrogen at power</i><br>
<i>&gt;  plants &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; actually, the author states the electrolysis can be done in the car, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason it's not in use is because the federal government told him that it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would ruin the economy.  Also, the media wont air the info because of fear,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is also why i believe many people wont go for it, even though its</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible (he gave instructions for it).</i><br>
<p>
This is one of the most idiotic things I've heard of late.<br>
<p>
We've got these little laws of physics called the Conservation of Mass<br>
and Energy. Burn hydrogen and oxygen, get water plus energy. Add<br>
energy to water correctly, get hydrogen and oxygen. The amount of<br>
energy you get burning hydrogen and oxygen is exactly equal to the<br>
amount you have to spend to make that much hydrogen and oxygen from<br>
water.<br>
<p>
In other words, BULLSHIT. You *can't* make energy by electrolyzing<br>
water and burning it, since you needed at least that much energy to do<br>
the electrolysis. I don't care what you read on the net, or what<br>
government conspiracies were invoked. It doesn't work.<br>
<p>
Next you'll be telling us about how you were abducted by aliens, and<br>
how if we only pray enough we can cure cancer.<br>
