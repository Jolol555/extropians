<p>
Not at all, governments have about a 2% accuracy rate, but that doesn't  <br>
prevent them from having all sorts of nifty common sense legislation. It's <br>
common sense that the Earth is the center of the Universe and those who say <br>
otherwise should be burned alive. It's common sense that black people are <br>
sub human and thus ethical to enslave. It's common sense that Jews are evil <br>
and so should be exterminated. It's common sense that government should <br>
monitor and control what we say to each other on the Internet, it's for our <br>
own good, we're too dumb to do it ourselves and your typical government <br>
bureaucrat is far more intelligent than either one of us.          <br>

                <br>
I have absolutely no objection to that, I might even help you, provided it's <br>
voluntary. My objection is when people insist of saving me from myself, <br>
whether I want to be saved or not. I don't think I'm significantly stupider <br>
than the average person and I don't want to be protected, if I'm wrong about <br>
my mental capacity I'm willing to accept the consequences.                <br>

<i>        &gt;absolutist fashion about free speech. It's one of my big gripes about         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the practice of libertarianism.  Taken to its extreme, there is just         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;efficiency and no feeling. [...] I'll continue to note signs of         </i><br>

Actually I'm a very nice fellow, my dog thinks I'm wonderful and it's been <br>
months since I evicted and widows and forced their pre school children to <br>
work in my rendering plant. My employees like me also, they tell me that all <br>
the time, good thing too, otherwise I'd fire their ass so fast it'd make your <br>
head spin. But then, why wouldn't they like me, hell, I let them take half<br>
a day off every other Christmas.<br>
