     A modest critique:<br>
     <br>
     Tony Hellick, in a number of his rather lengthy, yet cryptic posts <br>
     would seem to be possessed of a tremendous amount of knowledge and <br>
     potentially intriguing information.<br>
     <br>
     I am currently posing a rather pointed question to myself:<br>
     <br>
     Is my tendency to keep my finger pressed down on the Page Down key <br>
     through his messages because of my perception that he is woefully <br>
     unable to convey information packets to fellow humans in a compelling <br>
     fashion <br>
     <br>
     OR...<br>
     <br>
     that I, myself, am so woefully primitive in comaparison to his <br>
     stream-of-consciousness "you asked for it" spurts of seemingly <br>
     disconnected and questionably relevent information that I am simply <br>
     unable to comprehend it?  <br>
     <br>
     The secondary question is what is Tony's fundamental purpose in <br>
     presenting his montage of information in such a motif?  Presumably, <br>
     the point is to promote exchange of viable information.  I tend to <br>
     question and often disregard that which is presented in an <br>
     alarmist/cryptic/fear-based way.  Perhaps it's because I have only a <br>
     limited time to engage in this, perhaps because I don't want to <br>
     exchange time with those I believe are preoccupied with <br>
     fear/conspiracy.  <br>
     <br>
     Does the marathon runner spend most of his time worrying about the <br>
     other runners or his own performance?  To my mind, future-thinkers <br>
     would do best to devote little if any time to the boogie men under the <br>
     bed, real of imagined.  Fear has to stop being a motivation for our <br>
     culture, to be supplanted by the gratification of success.<br>
     <br>
     Peace and regards,<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
