We can also consider the motivations of someone who provides a free park.<br>
I would guess that it would be done mostly for PR purposes.  Maybe there<br>
would be small, tasteful signs at the main entrances, "This park provided<br>
through the generosity of XYZ Corporation, dedicated to improving the<br>
quality of public life."<br>
<p>
Now, if XYZ is doing it to improve their image and make people feel good<br>
about them, they won't want people to have a bad impression of the park.<br>
If it is an "anything goes" area, with people copulating and shooting up<br>
on the grass, this would make many visitors unhappy, in today's culture.<br>
XYZ Corp is going to end up getting bad publicity instead of the benefits<br>
they wanted.<br>
<p>
So I would expect free areas which are subsidized like this to hew<br>
pretty closely to average morality in what is allowed.  There would be<br>
specialized places for people with particular interests, like nudists,<br>
but that is no different from today's nudist camps and resorts.<br>
<p>
I don't know whether nudism is becoming more popular.  In some ways we<br>
see an increase in formerly "fringe" ideas due to the net, but at the<br>
same time there seems to be a backlash from mainstream religious morality.<br>
I'm very roughly guessing that the conservative religious forces will gain<br>
strength through the year 2000, but then that the millenialist fervor<br>
will die away (Christ's failure to return tarnishing the reputation of<br>
extremists, and by extension all religions) and perhaps there will be a<br>
swing back to liberal tolerance.  Your crystal ball is as good as mine,<br>
though!<br>
