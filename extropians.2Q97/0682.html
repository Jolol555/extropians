<i>&gt;&gt; Philosophical nit-pick: The logical positivists would not say this. They</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would say that the question of the existence of atoms is meaningless</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;*if* they cannot be observed. Any statement that cannot be broken &gt;&gt;down</i><br>
into directly observable entities is meaningless to the logical &gt;&gt;positivists.<br>

<i>&gt;What would "directly observable" mean?  Eyes?  Light microscope?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Accelerator?  Where does one draw the line?</i><br>

<i>&gt;Good questions, and they point to major problems with logical &gt;positivism.</i><br>
Today's descendents of the logical positivists are the &gt;empiricists like van<br>
Fraasen. I find far more plausible the scientific realist &gt;approach which<br>
lets you talk meaningfully about entities that cannot be &gt;directly observed<br>
(with unaided human senses) or observed at all (they &gt;can be inferred by<br>
their effects).<br>
<p>
This thread reminded me of a paper from my "Science, Reason, and<br>
Rationality" class last semester.<br>
<p>
On the topic of Hacking's arguments against anti-realism:<br>
---------<br>
     "One area that I think Hacking does not explore in enough depth is the<br>
anti-realist reliance solely upon the senses...  I would have explored this<br>
topic further. For instance, what would an anti-realist, who would deny the<br>
existence of infra-red radiation, think of a picture taken with a thermal<br>
imaging device? S/he would say that we have no way of knowing if it<br>
represents what is real. What would an anti-realist say, however, about a<br>
person who could see into the infra-red spectrum because of a genetic mutation? <br>
<p>
     Taking this line of questioning further, what if genetic engineering<br>
eventually allows us to enhance our current senses, allowing us to detect<br>
the polarization of photons, or even to design a completely new sense, such<br>
as the ability to detect ionizing radiation on our skin?<br>
----------<br>
<p>
I went on to point out that changes in human senses, whether from random<br>
mutation or engineered, would cause problems to the anti-realist position.<br>
My professor didn't think that this refuted the anti-realist argument to any<br>
extent. I don't know if his reaction was because I misinterpreted the<br>
anti-realist position and wasn't really arguing against a critical part of<br>
it, or because this would blow such a big hole in anti-realism that it<br>
wasn't readily apparent. Comments on this from the philosophy of science<br>
heavyweights on this list would be appreciated.<br>
