`And always has been', as I understand it, is the *common-sense error* in<br>
interpreting QT.  Actually the state is not fixed *until* the interaction,<br>
which is what makes non-local connections weird.  A different relativistic<br>
reference frame can show that your distant pal was the one who `first' set<br>
the polariser, entraining the result you see here and now.  Without<br>
simultaneity, traditional causality vanishes.  Strange world.<br>
