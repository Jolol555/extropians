<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE. LEAVE ME ALONE</i><br>
<i>&gt; To which ard saw fit to reply sarcastically:Huh?  Could you please repeat</i><br>
that?<br>
<i>&gt; With the result that the whole list was treated to &gt;I SAID LEAVE ME ALONE</i><br>
 LEAVE ME ALONELEAVE ME ALONE  LEAVE ME ALONE... for his trouble.<br>
<i>&gt; This is an excellent example of why I almost never use sarcasm. </i><br>
	Kennita,   "sarcasm"?  We did not know who wrote it or why.  As it was<br>
repeated over and over, it appeared to be a joke of some sort and our<br>
response was in the spirit of humour.  That someone left such a message in<br>
the first place as a serious response to something on this list was not<br>
considered since there was nothing preceeding it which indicated that to be<br>
the case.<br>
	Thanks for your concern though.<br>
