Lee described an experiment with insomnia and melatonin:<br>
&lt;The result was that I found my insomnia did in fact go away, but <br>
under both the drug and the placebo, so it was probably just due to <br>
the ritual of taking something and going to bed at a regular time <br>
nightly, not due to anything the drug did.  Of course, a larger study <br>
over a longer period of time might well show some real effect, but I <br>
was at least satisfied that I wouldn't benefit much from continuous <br>
outlay of money on melatonin.&gt;<br>
<p>
Of course, and the brain also produces its own melatonin, which <br>
complicates the results...<br>
<p>
You might do the same experiment with headaches and aspirin and get <br>
the same inconclusive results. For example, I don't have headaches <br>
every day, nor do I have trouble sleeping every day; and, I can put up <br>
with a headache and it will probably be gone in the morning, but that <br>
doesn't mean the aspirin wouldn't help with a headache at the right <br>
time. Nor would I necessarily use the aspirin every day. (And in the <br>
case of aspirin, it reputedly also has long-term affects on the <br>
'health of the heart', further complicating the analysis.)<br>
<p>
Your assumption that "it was probably just due to the ritual" is just <br>
as biased and simplistic (simplistic because it tries to fit a <br>
non-linear, multi-variate situation to a linear, single-variable <br>
equation) as the pill-popper's assumption that it is the pill that is <br>
doing all the work.<br>
<p>
I asked<br>
<i>&gt; How do you measure a 'rapture effect' without doing something</i><br>
<i>&gt; impractical like measuring the level of endorphins in the brain?</i><br>
<p>
Lee answered:<br>
&lt;Simple: ask.  Give a dozen people a euphoric, and another dozen a <br>
vitamin or something, then have them all answer multiple-choice <br>
questions about how they feel.  If the answers to some question <br>
correlate strongly enough with those who took the real drug, you've <br>
shown a measured effect (certainly not a conclusive one, but at least <br>
better than nothing).&gt;<br>
<p>
I said 'rapture effect' in quotes precisely because I don't have good <br>
descriptions for many of these mental states, even though I have spent <br>
many hours trying to describe them for my own edification. A selection <br>
of multiple-choice descriptions is too simplistic - there are times <br>
when I could have answered "all of the above" to any list you might <br>
provide even though some of the selections might seem contradictory.<br>
<p>
When dealing with human health, moods and cognitive capacities, we are <br>
dealing with a VERY complex system that does not submit to simple <br>
mechanical measurements.<br>
