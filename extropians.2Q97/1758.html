What I have in mind is anything that replicates physically (or for that <br>
matter anything that creates something that creates something).  Organism <br>
was a poor choose of words on my part.  I was going to say molecule but <br>
that was to specific to early evolution.  I also considered thing.  <br>
Your term agent is not bad.  <br>
<p>
Genes are one of the things that evolve but they are not the only thing.<br>
Bits of DNA both smaller and larger than genes evolve as do other molecules<br>
in the body, most but not all of these molecules are coded for by genes.<br>
I find it easiest to understand the principles with simple molecules.<br>
<p>
I'll reiterate.  The number of copies of something in existence can be<br>
reduced to four factors, the number of copies you start with, the amount<br>
of time a given copy endures, the rate at which a copy duplicates itself and<br>
the fidelity of the copying.<br>
<p>
It gets slightly more complicated if one allows for mutations and considers<br>
them as partial duplicates.<br>
<p>
I don't at all mind personifying genes as long as we keep occasionally<br>
reminding ourselves we are doing so and reconsidering any new results without<br>
personification.  When we say "what genes want" I generally translate that<br>
to what genes tend to do.<br>
<p>
Genes can be taken to mean the physical DNA in my body or to mean every <br>
instance of a given DNA sequence in all the bodies it occupies.  So, some genes<br>
prefer to be in many individuals and some don't.  I suppose when many<br>
people say genes want they are suggesting what the most common genes tend<br>
to do or perhaps suggesting the best survival strategy for a gene.<br>
<p>
I think I can safely say that successful genes (the ones that are common or <br>
endure) use many different strategies and what is most successful varies with<br>
the environment.  Genes and other similar molecules affect their environment<br>
and the environment in turn affects them.  Some genes use strategies that are <br>
successful only because of the way they interact with more common genes<br>
(fighting to the death over food for example works best when many others use a <br>
flee strategy) the various genes tend to reach a equilibrium (so many thieves <br>
per system).<br>
<p>
All that being said I would concur that genes are usually better off having<br>
copies in many different and diverse bodies and that most genes prefer to<br>
do so.  However there can be disadvantages to that strategy in some<br>
situations.  This seems to be a very hard lesson for evolution to learn<br>
I suppose because genes have not had long to adapt to human level intelligence.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Many genes do encourage violent competition and do quite well by it.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The genes "want" as many copies of themselves as possible, by whatever means</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible.  And they are *incredibly* dense.  Insofar as they "think", it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;over evolutionary timescales.</i><br>
<p>
Genes want what genes get.  I am suggesting that I think a more cooperative<br>
system is what we are likely to get and therefore what genes have been<br>
working towards (admittedly in a very indirect way).  <br>
<p>
In a sense you are more correct.  Genes want many things from <br>
suicide to ice cream.  Most genes want to replicate (some quick and dirty <br>
others more cautiously).  Violent and competitive genes are present in <br>
most organisms and have varying degrees of influence. However I think that <br>
less violence in the long run is a high probability event and therefore <br>
the "desire" of the collection of all genes.<br>
<p>
Genes don't particularly want there own survival that is just a means to an<br>
end.  To genes (as a group) what is important is that they create one or<br>
more intelligent creatures capable of surviving.  After that they don't care <br>
what we do.  I am being a bit playful here but if I am going to personify <br>
genes I may as well make them friendly.  I realize many other scenarios are <br>
possible but I may as well assume the best.<br>
<p>
Here is my reasoning.  Once you have mutating self replicators intelligence<br>
is quite likely. With increases in intelligence the capacity for violence<br>
becomes greater.  The higher the cost of violence the less favorable the<br>
reward ratio for using it.  You tend to end up with something like a nuke<br>
on every block and a strong incentive never to have anyone get really<br>
nasty.  <br>
<p>
Then again I have seen a lot of E. coli breed till they all die<br>
off from lack of nutrients.  If enough genes do enough stupid things<br>
everything gets to start over.  Or violence may persist at a moderate<br>
level below some threshold of serious adaptation.  <br>
<p>
Its all getting to complex in my head at this point.  I don't think I or<br>
anyone else knows what is going to happen or what genes tend to do in the<br>
long run.  I do think there is a lot more to be learned by looking at the <br>
question (preferably with math and computers) but not by me today.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Actually if we get to that point, memes will be running the show and not</i><br>
<i>&gt;genes.  The genes will just be tools at that point and considering them as</i><br>
<i>&gt;self-interested agents won't give any useful information.  </i><br>
<p>
Individual genes really don't act as if they have goals (well, really<br>
simple ones maybe but nothing as grand as replication).  Groups of genes<br>
look more goal oriented.  Evolution working on most genes over time seems<br>
to be going somewhere.  If we say genes have goals then one of their goals<br>
was to create memes so I'll hold them responsible.<br>
<p>
I think what I am getting at is that some of the earlier post about genes<br>
seemed to frame them as enemies, something to overcome.  Genes are much<br>
nicer to people than the non living universe.  They have made a stunningly<br>
beautiful world for us.  In aggregate they seem to be working towards<br>
creating life that transcends them.  <br>
<p>
If a gene does something to my advantage it is just as reasonable to say it <br>
did it for me as to say it did it for itself.  Selfish genes tend to <br>
survive more than unselfish genes but if a gene creates a mutant even<br>
more likely to survive than it or other genes, then we would be more<br>
correct to call that gene altruistic than selfish.  So, genes tend to be<br>
selfish but every now and then one comes along that is altruistic<br>
and makes something even better than itself.<br>
<p>
I generally avoid personifying genes.  I also frequently find it useful not <br>
to personify people, or rather to remind myself what is really going on in <br>
their brain.  Once again what we actually have is a continuum which at some<br>
fuzzy level of directed behavior we call purpose.<br>
<p>
Anyway, please don't take me seriously when I personify genes<br>
in significant ways.  Its mostly tongue in cheek.  I suggest anyone<br>
adding to this discussion define what they mean by genes as they use<br>
the various meanings.  There is unfortunately no standard meaning.<br>
