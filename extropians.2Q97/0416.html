<i>&gt; From:          "Laws, David" &lt;lawsd@magic.dcrt.nih.gov&gt;</i><br>
[snip]<br>
<i>&gt; In the US 50% of all traffic deaths involves at least one driver having</i><br>
<i>&gt; an 'illegal' BAC.  This is appealed to in the courts and legislatures.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This TOTALLY assumes you can't add and deduce you're as likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; killed by a sober driver as one who has been drinking! ...</i><br>
<p>
That's true, but unless half the drivers on the road at any given <br>
time are legally drunk, the 50% statistic still shows that a drunk <br>
driver is much more dangerous than a sober one.  That is with all <br>
else being equal, of course, but I'm not arguing that intoxication is <br>
the ONLY thing that can cause hazardous driving.  Granted, I don't <br>
have a statistic for how many drivers are legally drunk at any given <br>
moment.  But 50%?  I doubt that 50% of the population gets drunk <br>
even once a week, let alone having 50% drunk at all times.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (I'm sure there</i><br>
<i>&gt; IS a percentage of traffic deaths due solely to drinking, but it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; nowhere near 50%.)   In other words, according to the statistics it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'How you drive more than what you imbibe' because if you drive like an</i><br>
<i>&gt; idiot sober you'll drive like an idiot after drinking.  .....</i><br>
<p>
Huh?  Are you actually proposing that intoxication doesn't impair <br>
mental function?  Why the heck do people get drunk in the first <br>
place?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; However,</i><br>
<i>&gt; EVERYONE who drinks and drives is considered a criminal, even though YOU</i><br>
<i>&gt; might be safer on the road with a BAC of .1 over some fool who</i><br>
<i>&gt; disreguards all common sense and drives aggressively (and WILL</i><br>
<i>&gt; eventually kill someone) and has a BAC of .00.</i><br>
<p>
IMHO, everyone who drinks and drives IS a criminal, whether they<br>
actually cause an accident or not.  The crime is in seriously and<br>
unnecessarily endangering the lives of others.  The only thing that<br>
seperates the drunk driver who kills someone from the one who<br>
doesn't is pure dumb luck.<br>
<p>
I do agree that driving while intoxicated isn't any more criminal <br>
than driving while stupid, but that comparison doesn't make drunk <br>
driving any less of a problem.  I suppose that ethically, driving <br>
while stupid should be just as illegal and punishable as driving <br>
drunk.  But unfortunately, it comes down to the purely practical <br>
problem that stupidity is a much more difficult thing to measure <br>
objectively.  Although it could be argued that blood alcohol level <br>
while behind the wheel is in itself one fairly good objective <br>
indicator of stupidity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; drinking!  How logical is that?  It's the emotion of the 'evil</i><br>
<i>&gt; drunk driver' that encourages such law.  Remember, logic has no</i><br>
<i>&gt; bearing. We have been appealed to emotionally that drinking causes</i><br>
<i>&gt; death when the statistics themselves prove it's driving habits (US</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyway).</i><br>
<p>
Of course the problem is driving habits, but are driving habits not <br>
affected by drunkennes?<br>
<p>
Consider this:<br>
<p>
1. Driving while intoxicated is significantly more dangerous than <br>
not, and therefore can be considered negligent.<br>
<p>
2. Drunk drivers endanger more lives than just their own.  Therefore, <br>
laws against drunk driving can't be written off as just protecting <br>
people from themselves.<br>
<p>
3. The purpose of law is not just to get revenge on those who do<br>
harm.  It is also to serve as a deterrent to prevent people from<br>
doing harm in the first place.  To that end, penalizing people for<br>
negligent behaviour is quite reasonable, even if no harm has yet<br>
occurred.  Of course, this kind of  deterrent will only work for<br>
reasonably sensible people.  Unreasonable senseless people will<br>
commit the crime anyway, and will end up being penalized.  Seems<br>
like a pretty good arrangement to me.<br>
<p>
The point of all that being that drunk driving laws are easily <br>
defensible with no appeal to emotion.  It seems to me that your <br>
objection to those laws is itself an appeal to emotion rather than <br>
reason.  Painting a picture of the big bad government vs. the <br>
innocent free citizen.  Hardly a convincing picture when that citizen <br>
is drunkenly cruising the streets putting everyone at risk.<br>
<p>
One of the few truly rational arguments against drunk driving laws<br>
is that just letting 'em drive drunk will allow natural selection to<br>
do its work and prevent a few morons from breeding.  I don't think<br>
DWI laws really defeat that though.  They just make it a bit more<br>
selective in that it requires that one not only be stupid enough to<br>
drink &amp; drive, but that one also be stupid enough to do it even<br>
though he/she can face legal penalties even if he/she is fortunate<br>
enough to not be a member of that "someone else" group of people<br>
that bad things always happen to.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I guess US citizens will only understand this when it's illegal</i><br>
<i>&gt; (AGAIN) to consume alcohol and 100% of all traffic deaths are due</i><br>
<i>&gt; to sober drivers who drive like idiots, or we realise the reduction</i><br>
<i>&gt; of traffic deaths is due more to the fact that automobiles</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves are safer and are the major cause of reduced deaths</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than a criminalization of drinking. </i><br>
<p>
Hmm.  The old "Where does it end?" or "If it goes this far why not<br>
further?" deception.  Given a bit of thought, the answer is pretty<br>
clear.<br>
<p>
Where does it end?  It ends with tasks in which inebriation <br>
causes a clear danger to others.<br>
<p>
Why will it not go further?  Because drunk driving laws aren't about <br>
the "sinfulness" of alcoholic beverages.  It's about negligent <br>
behavior that threatens lives.<br>
<p>
Connecting drunk driving laws with prohibition just doesn't work.<br>
