I believe that coercion is immoral.  So as far as I am concerned, asking <br>
whether our tax system is a "legitimate form of coercion" is oxymoronic.  <br>
While this is indeed a simplistic  premise, it works for me and forms the <br>
basis of much of my philosophical and political viewpoint.<br>
<p>
So perhaps we'll just agree to disagree on this basic point.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The contingency factors I refer to are the inputs involved in formulating</i><br>

<i>&gt;groups have legitimate needs. </i><br>
<p>
I believe that _I_ have legitimate needs.  Does that make it right for me <br>
to force you to pay for these needs?  Adding a middleman in the form of a <br>
legislator or a bureaucrat who serves only to compel you to pay me should <br>
have no effect on the basic morality or immorality of this question.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Obviously, some interest groups are wholly self serving and have no</i><br>
<i>&gt;interests beyond their own selfish needs.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I think it could be argued that _all_ interest groups are <br>
wholly self-serving, since by definition an interest group is a <br>
collection of individuals who unite around a common set of beliefs and <br>
attempt to cause change in a direction consistent with those beliefs.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;In these instances a</i><br>
<i>&gt;counteractive filtering process takes place to take as many non-considered</i><br>
<i>&gt;factors under advisement in order to provide greater equity in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;formulation of a policy. Indeed, this does not always work the way we would</i><br>
<i>&gt;like. </i><br>
<p>
So you admit that the legislator applies his own perceptions, beliefs, <br>
and biases to the requests of these groups, and makes judgements of the <br>
worthiness of their claims based on his opinions?  How can he possibly <br>
know their needs better than they do?  The fact that things don't always <br>
work out "the way we would like" only serves to illustrate that none of <br>
us, not even the legislator, is omniscient.  Quite often, we do not even <br>
posesses complete information about the particular issue at hand.  But <br>
until we develop a reliable method of mind-reading, the only person who <br>
knows what a particular person values and needs is that particular <br>
person.  Which is why I believe that an anarcho-capitalistic, free-market <br>
system, which leaves each person free to conduct transactions based <br>
solely on his or her values and needs, is currently the optimal <br>
political/economic arrangement.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;No system is perfect.</i><br>
<p>
I agree with you.  (I don't want to be completely contrary!)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The object is to keep as open a mind as is possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;and encourage the development of an ever greater paradigm that can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;applied to the betterment of the human condition. Within such a framework</i><br>
<i>&gt;all things can be considered and integrated to the extent that they have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;constructive effect on an increasingly literate and slowly evolving</i><br>
<i>&gt;society.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you specifically have in mind here.  But I can't think <br>
of an arrangement which is more open-minded, and which leaves people more <br>
free to develop and better themselves, than the free market.  Admittedly <br>
such an arrangement can't be controlled, or its results predicted, but as <br>
you've already admitted, the same is true for the "democratic" system in <br>
which we currently live and which you seem to advocate.<br>
