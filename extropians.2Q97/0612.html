I have this friend who is in a graduate visual arts program at George <br>
Mason.  Lo and behold, in his art/media/philosophy/crit class, they <br>
studied the works of Orlan and other members of the Fluxus group, <br>
which leads him to mention that he has this friend who is hooked into <br>
this crazy idea called transhumanism that relates to this type of <br>
art.  <br>
<p>
I sent a followup email to his professor to clarify a few points, and <br>
the next day, this professor grabs Michael in the hallway to ask him <br>
to give a lecture the next day in class on the subject of <br>
extropianism and transhumanism!  Unable to reach me that day, he <br>
frantically downloaded everything he could find, found a few notes I <br>
had scribbled in one of his books, and winged it for 45 minutes.  He was <br>
too embarrassed to tell me what he had actually said, but evidently the <br>
class members showed a high level of interest.  Hopefully I or someone <br>
else local can give a talk for this professor's next class cycle, with <br>
more preparation.  But I told Michael that for effort alone he gets a <br>
gold star!<br>
