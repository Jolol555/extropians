<i>&gt; Now that the CDA has been defeated in the Supreme Court, pundits are </i><br>
<i>&gt; focusing on user-education and self-filtering programs.  PICS has been </i><br>
<i>&gt; mentioned as an up and coming standard for user-filtration.  However, </i><br>
<i>&gt; WIRED has mentioned that PICS could be used by anybody to censor others </i><br>
<i>&gt; without their knowledge or consent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is this going to be a problem?  And can anybody explain to me how this </i><br>
<i>&gt; could be done?  And most importantly since this a technical form of </i><br>
<i>&gt; censorship, is there a technical way around it?</i><br>
<p>
Freedom of expression does not give one the right to force others to<br>
listen if they don't want to.  A PICS labelling bureau can evaluate<br>
any site by any criteria it wants, and subscribers can choose any<br>
bureau they want and choose to filter on any ratings they want.  That<br>
is not by any stretch of the dictionary "censorship"; it is enabling<br>
the user to make his own choices; after all, his right to listen to<br>
only what he wants is every bit as valid as your right to say what<br>
you want.  I am a free speech radical absolutist, but if you want to<br>
put me in your killfile, I have no right to complain, nor do I have<br>
any right to know that you have done so or why.  A PICS bureau is no<br>
different.  If they choose to label a site "adult", they are under no<br>
obligation to explain, inform, or grant any recourse.  They are only<br>
exercising /their/ free speech to evaluate and label.<br>
<p>
I'd like to start a PICS bureau that labelled sites for "cluefulness",<br>
so that users could filter out various levels of idiocy.<br>
