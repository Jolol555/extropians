I think about half the research money comes from private sources, but my<br>
poor memory of this is not worth much. I'm sure someone will have the real<br>
figures.<br>
<p>
In discussing this question--what happens to research without state<br>
support--I think it's important to put it in a broad context. We would get<br>
a seriously wrong picture if we imagine the govt. research money going away<br>
while everything else stayed the same.For us to get to the stage of no<br>
government science funding, we would probably have also got rid of much of<br>
government in general. In that case, I believe, economic growth would be<br>
much higher and so private-only investment would very soon exceed what<br>
private + state investment would have been in a more state-regulated and<br>
taxed economy.<br>
<p>
In a free market, I don't think we'd have the absurd spectacle of<br>
ex-Randian Alan Greenspan pushing up interest rates every time economic<br>
growth reaches 3%. WIth faster growth and resulting greater wealth, we'd<br>
soon see greater investment from private only sources. I think "soon" could<br>
be very soon if you take into account the economic drag resulting from the<br>
millions of regulations currently weighing down our semi-free economy.<br>
<p>
Speculation and theory aside, there's only one way to really test the idea:<br>
Let's put our robots and nano to work, build a space colony, and make sure<br>
it's real free market. The challenge is how to do that and how to prevent<br>
the economic system decaying into statism. One of the panel discussions at<br>
EXTRO 3 will address that.<br>
