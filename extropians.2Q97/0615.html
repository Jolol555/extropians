<i>&gt;Recently I requested from the participants of  this  list, any and all</i><br>
<i>&gt;information  available here on the net  which  members could provided</i><br>
<i>&gt;to me in assisting  in my recuperation from my recent heart attack.</i><br>
<p>
The best I could tell you would be to do an AltaVista advanced query on<br>
"(recuperate OR recuperation) NEAR "heart attack".  You can also check<br>
out Medline.  There's an abstract search engine there, and there also<br>
happens to be an article on eating habits and heart health.  The URL is<br>
<a href="http://www.healthgate.com/HealthGate/MEDLINE/search.shtml">http://www.healthgate.com/HealthGate/MEDLINE/search.shtml</a>.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let me help you in your discourse, first you must have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;heart  attack,  then go to any major hospital=92s  ER, and  lastly  you</i><br>
<i>&gt;must believe that death is only 5 feet behind you, and gaining with each</i><br>
<i>&gt;second that passes.  After that, you might reprogram  your discussions</i><br>
<i>&gt;concerning God.</i><br>
<p>
You were obviously extremely frightened by your experience.  Certainly I<br>
would be too, but even if I become frightened enough to start believing<br>
in God (unlikely), I'll want to make sure my friends are ready to execute<br>
my cryonics arrangements -- I have a lot more confidence in them (the<br>
friends _and_ the arrangements).<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You remind me of what  President L. Johnson once said in his description</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the Washington Press Corp.</i><br>
<i>&gt;=93 I wish one of those Bastards had run for Dog Catcher. before coming to</i><br>
<i>&gt;this town=94</i><br>
<p>
I can see you're feeling hostile about your reception.  I on the other<br>
hand am feeling unfairly attacked, perhaps taking too personally your<br>
inclusive "you".  I'll put it behind me -- I hope you can too.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don=92t contribute to this or any other list,  only because I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing to contribute, this is either caused by the lack of knowledge or</i><br>
<i>&gt;the fear of  an intellectual discourse with people more glib and more</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligent than myself.</i><br>
<p>
The people here are certainly glib and intelligent, but I can hardly<br>
believe that the people on every mailing list you come across are more<br>
glib and intelligent than you are.  Being able to spell "participant",<br>
"recuperation", and "experience" puts you a cut above a lot of people<br>
right there.<br>
<p>
I hate when people run themselves down that way (maybe I'm sensitized<br>
because I've done it so often).<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Concerning  my  smoking, I  have been smoke free since 01/01/97.</i><br>
<p>
Congratulations!  Keep up the good work, and don't be surprised or<br>
disheartened if you still feel cravings after a year or more.<br>
<p>
How are you doing with cutting your nicotine dose?  Patches are<br>
better than smoking, but as you've discovered the hard way, nicotine<br>
is still not good for you.<br>
<p>
BTW -- how much exercise do you get?  If you're eating those bran<br>
muffins, and your fruits and vegetables, that may be the next thing<br>
to tackle.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Kennita<br>
