Very high temperature incineration (thousands of degrees) already does what<br>
you're talking about.  Things don't come out as atoms, of course, but<br>
recombine into simple molecules (which ones depends on the inputs).  Still,<br>
it's easy to manage the resulting chemicals (things like CO2, water, various<br>
metal ores, etc.).  You can always add oxygen to the mix but putting in air.<br>
<p>
Very high temperature incineration is used for some nasty toxins but rarely<br>
for the mundane reason that all that energy makes it very expensive.  It's<br>
cheaper to bury, so that's what's usually done.  It's been proposed for<br>
recycling in space, as it's more thorough than purification or biological<br>
processes and there's noplace to bury things without rocketing them to the<br>
Sun or Jupiter, which would be even more expensive than the incineration.<br>
