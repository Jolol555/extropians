The influence of your parents during childhood, you are legally stuck<br>
with, though with a good shrink, one can usually minimize the damage<br>
later. You pick your freinds, so its your fault what they do to you. You<br>
vote for your elected representatives, so its your fault what they do to<br>
you.<br>
<p>
One could reasonably say, "buy that magazine at your own risk, caveat<br>
emptor", although this is a place where one's right to be informed is<br>
used to do an end run around your privacy. However, I wouldn't want to<br>
have to lock my TIME and NEWSWEEK magazines up in a safe like my guns<br>
and Playboys/Penthouse's just to keep them away from my kids. Nor would<br>
I want my kids or nieces/ nephews to be bombarded with billboards<br>
enticing them to smoke while they are on the bus on their way to school.<br>
I also do not see any commercial free sources of news available.<br>
