     I reply,<br>
     <br>
     Sorry if I am one of those people.  It does occur for me that amongst <br>
     the many contributors to this list, there is a preference for those <br>
     things most proveable, tangible and material rather than anything <br>
     etherial, supposed, or otherwise imagined.  I think there is validity <br>
     in both arenas and one should be neither entirely material and <br>
     pragmatic or lost in the clouds and a naive nudnick for any slick <br>
     story/meaning of life that comes along.<br>
     <br>
     I certainly don't regard my tactic as arguing by intimidation (since I <br>
     don't profess to argue and intimidation is a shut down tactic in order <br>
     to be "right"/win, which in turn, limits information exchange).  <br>
     <br>
     Rudeness is interpretation and for the most part, the wordings of many <br>
     posts would have to be fairly explicit for me to interpret them as <br>
     rude since so much meaning is not imparted by this media (no body <br>
     language, inflection, etc., just words).<br>
     <br>
     So it could be circularly observed that to brand comments (none were <br>
     referenced so we'll just go with the general tone of the digest) as <br>
     attempts to intimidate and then further labeling those comments rude <br>
     is a defense/fear mechanism in and of itself.  Moreover, deciding to <br>
     be offended may be regarded as a tactic to divert attention away from <br>
     the informational exchange to devote to oneself and their feelings.  <br>
     <br>
     Rather a lot to extrapolate on such a brief statement but I am somehow <br>
     strangely compelled.<br>
     <br>
