             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
Hmmm...<br>
<p>
After being chucked out of the Freedom Association, Top Thatcher aide and <br>
speechwriter Robert Moss wrote a best-selling 'roman-a-clef' 'The Spike', <br>
published Feb. 6, 1980, ISTR.  It recycles the paranoid Rightist fantasy <br>
that the leading left-wing think-tank in America, the Institute for Policy <br>
Studies, is a KGB 'outstation', and is also involved with international <br>
terrorists.   Yet the US has a Foreign Agents Registration Act, so _why <br>
didn't the FBI_ (which does the US counterespionage stuff too) 'bust' them <br>
all?  They never arrested or charged anyone, AFAIK.  IPS is still there <br>
after the Soviets have disappeared.<br>
<p>
<p>
Rep. Larry McDonald (7th District, Georgia) read some of this stuff into <br>
the Congrressional Record, afterr Orlando Letelier (former Chilean Foreign <br>
Minister and Senior Fellow at IPS), and Ronnie Moffet (who worked at IPS) <br>
were assassinated by a car-bomb on Embassy Row in Washington.<br>
<p>
He was also vocal about CIA Station Chief Richard Welch, who  was <br>
assassinated in Athens, which US Rightists tried to blame on the <br>
'CounterSpy' people being involved in 'disclosing' his home address (an <br>
address known to just about everyone in Athens, and identified by the East <br>
German press much earlier. Nat Hentoff, VP of the ACLU wrote for <br>
CounterSpy.  John Ranelagh's brilliant book 'The Agency' discusses this <br>
case thoroughly and exonerates them.. Ranelagh's no 'crazed leftie.'<br>
<p>
The .45 ACP automatic pistol used to kill him has since been used in other <br>
kilings by the shadowy terrorist group 'November 17'.  Note the date.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, Larry McDonald was himself later a passenger on KAL 007 <br>
when it was shot down, presumably by the Soviets. An unanswered question <br>
is why the KAL transponder apparrently did not automatic returm a <br>
'Civilian Airliner' identifier when 'illuminated' by Soviet radars. If it <br>
was rigged to return an 'E4B' (Airborne Command and Control) ID, it's no <br>
surprise that the Soviets got over-eager.<br>
<p>
In the UK, Soviet 'Bear'  reconaissance bombers frequently intruded into <br>
British airspace.  We just sent up a pair of Lightnings, and they formated <br>
one over the left wing and one under the right wing, and turned it through <br>
180 degrees..  Photos were later exchanged of crew larking about and <br>
smiling at earch other...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
Moss was also a crony of Pinochet's.  He also gave lectures to the <br>
Argentine Junta's military Academies prior to the Falklands war, telling <br>
them that the Thatcher government viewd Argentina as the model for the <br>
whole of Latin America...  He was also the first editor of 'Policy <br>
Review', the journal of the very powerful Heritage Foundation in <br>
Washington.<br>

TITLE:  The Open Society and its Enemies...<br>
<p>
[This is a brief account of some of my experiences of the "Thatcher Years."<br>
Of course, some of these events may have various possible explanations.<br>
Without there having been an adequate investigation, it's not possible to<br>
know.  I am not making threats, or issuing demands. This file most recently<br>
revised 27 March 1997].<br>
<p>
[1978] 18th December; 1:00 a.m. I came within ten minutes of being killed<br>
when a large (@ 150 lb.) car-bomb exploded next to the "Oasis" building in<br>
Holborn (an MI5 outstaion), on my route home.  This was after David Davis and<br>
Graham Smith had stopped their car in Tottenham Court Road next to the YMCA<br>
(where another two bombs exploded in the car park that same night), so that I<br>
could walk home to the Alternative Bookshop in Floral Street, Covent Garden.<br>
<p>
[1979] Graham Smith, Gerald Hartup and I were verbally threatened,<br>
manhandled, and our property destroyed, by a dozen SWP and Communist Party<br>
people in the presence of Mr. Gordon McLennan, the Secretary of the Communist<br>
Party (whose assistant fetched the attackers), while we were distributing<br>
entirely innocuous "Freedom Association" literature to the public at Brixton<br>
Underground Station, pointing out the distinction between communism and<br>
capitalism:  "Under Capitalism, you are free to criticise Capitalism.  Under<br>
Communism, you are also free to criticize Capitalism."<br>
<p>
    On several occasions while I was living and working there, bricks were<br>
thrown, smashing through the front windows of the Alternative Bookshop at 40<br>
Floral Street; and telephoned threats were received, as well as other acts<br>
directed against the property.<br>
<p>
July 1879: I was dismissed from my job at "The Freedom Association",<br>
supposedly for attending an ISOS/Heritage Foundation Summer School at<br>
Cambridge during my holiday, at which I was asked by the ISOS organizers to<br>
give a talk on libertarian ideas. This was after an article by the notorious<br>
right-wing conservative and police witness Ernest van den Haag attacking<br>
libertarianism had been published by the American conservative magazine<br>
"National Review" in their July issue. Van den Haag was a participant at the<br>
Summer School, as were Gerald Frost, Geordie Hayward, Diana Bowen, Graham<br>
Smith and Keith Joseph.<br>
<p>
    Afterwards, a letter was brought to my attention, dated 14 August 1979,<br>
written by the director of "The Freedom Association", a Defence intelligence<br>
Staff army major, Derek Jackson to Lord de l'Isle, the chairman, saying that<br>
"It might be said that we have already in part neutralised the situation as<br>
the two most outspoken of the Alliance are Hollick and Chris Tame." Graham<br>
Smith was not objected to, it seems.  A month later, my friend Gerald Hartup<br>
was also dismissed, but Jackson and Smith themselves were ousted before this<br>
came into effect.<br>
<p>
[1980] Feb 4; My aunt and godparent Mrs. Joyce Pike was found dead in a<br>
river, supposedly from drowning, outside Glenside Hospital, an hour after<br>
news of a "mistaken diagnosis" of depression had been notified to me by<br>
telephone by her consultant, a Dr. Charneaud. This was after she had been<br>
subjected to months of ruinous hospitalization at Barrow, extended<br>
electroshock (at the hands of Drs. Rooth and Hughes) and drug "treatment"<br>
entirely inappropriate to a _thyroid condition_.<br>
<p>
    She herself said her problem was pain and disability casued by an<br>
incompetent knee operation, which had left her hardly able to walk, and look<br>
after her husband.  My telephone calls were made from a phone subject to<br>
interception, at the Alangate Group Chairman's office.<br>
<p>
[1981] On 3 June I had to abandon my home completely and immediately , on <br>
police instructions from David Hedges, after threats were made against me <br>
and the life of my pet cat on 2nd June by one Rex Smoothy, a criminal.  He threatened to cut Beeper's throat in front of me.<br>
<p>
This necessitated my moving immediately to David Davis's house in Denmark <br>
Rd., Bedford, more than sixty miles (five hours a day travelling time) <br>
away from my place of work.<br>
<p>
[1982] My main client company (the Alangate Group of employment agencies) was<br>
finally deliberately and unlawfully put out of business by Inland Revenue<br>
Special Office officials, owing me #1,700.00, and leaving several thousand<br>
people without work, and this after John Blundell, Gerald Frost, Lord<br>
Cockfield and others at the Centre for Policy Studies had been told what was<br>
going on.  This was the second time this had happened.<br>
<p>
1982: My uncle and godparent Bertram Pike, a retired trade union leader, was<br>
found dead (and his will was found to have been changed; no probate document<br>
was ever received). One of his friends has said there was something<br>
suspicious about his death; I have no means of knowing.<br>
<p>
July 1982: The MI5-controlled publication "Searchlight" published an article<br>
attacking George Miller, a young Liberal Party officer and NTS anti-Soviet<br>
activist; and the Libertarian Alliance, a small human-rights group which I<br>
had helped to found.  This attack 'coincided' with the KGB arresting NTS free<br>
trade union activists in Russia.<br>
<p>
22 Aug; A contentious Libertarian Alliance (LA) foreign policy day-school<br>
took place.<br>
<p>
October; the LA dispute worsened. At Chris Tame's request, I went to his<br>
assistance, and that of the Alternative Bookshop and George Miller. A<br>
sub-group of Libertarian Alliance members, led by David Ramsay Steele and<br>
Mark Brady, and supported by the American-based Institute for Humane Studies<br>
and SEARCHLIGHT, were trying illicitly to seize control of the Alternative<br>
Bookshop and the LA.<br>
<p>
20 Nov; Michael Zegarac threatened to arrange for the Socialist Workers'<br>
Party to fire-bomb the Alternative Bookshop, if Chris Tame got into a fight.<br>
Steele repeatedly threatened to publicly "name" Chris Tame, Judy Tame, myself<br>
and others as "intelligence agents", implying that we were acting under<br>
direction, when -- as far as I know -- none of us ever had.<br>
<p>
15 Dec; A menacing -- blackmailing -- letter from David Ramsay Steele<br>
addressed "To Whom It May Concern" was forwarded to the DPP by our --<br>
concerned -- Solicitors.<br>
<p>
24 Dec; A very unpleasant entrapment attempt took place, when a "security<br>
guard" approached me in a railway carriage, asked me if I had a "shooter",<br>
and then offered to _kill_ Steele and his associates for money.<br>
<p>
25 Dec; These incidents were pre-emptively reported by me to the Metropolitan<br>
Police, who seemed in no hurry whatsoever to obtain a description of the<br>
'hit-man'.<br>
<p>
[1983] 9 Jan.; After further efforts on my part to get the authorities to<br>
deal with the deteriorating situation, I was asked by the Anti-Terrorist<br>
Branch at New Scotland Yard (C13) to stay on after Hillel Steiner's inquiry<br>
at the Waldorf Hotel so as to learn more of the intentions of Steele and his<br>
associates.<br>
<p>
11 Jan.; I did so: more threats, and violent attacks by Steele occurred (and<br>
were reported by complaint later that night to C13)<br>
<p>
13 Jan.; According to a C13 officer, the matter was the responsibility of the<br>
Metropolitan Police, Special Branch (C11). During a meeting with two of their<br>
people which took place at Beckenham Police Station, which they started by<br>
saying that they were investigating allegations of security "leaks", it was<br>
rather obvious they would prefer these matters to be ignored, and hints to me<br>
of ten-year terms of imprisonment for "conspiracy to murder" making it harder<br>
to leave the country rather emphasised this. They seemed quite friendly. I<br>
would not want to harm Steele's life-chances, and I would also prefer a quiet<br>
life. I said I did not want to press charges for assault and threats to<br>
murder, and that I wanted Steele to rejoin his American wife in America.<br>
<p>
[ The officer was Detective-Inspector Ray Dowd ]<br>
<p>
    On returning to the U.S., Steele, with his friend Brady, rewarded this<br>
forbearance by publishing a variety of abuse, disinformation and allegations<br>
of involvement with British intelligence and so on, in "Libertarian<br>
Vanguard", a publication controlled by US government informers.  When I<br>
discussed their threats of further 'revelations' with Special Agent Dolan of<br>
the San Francisco Branch of the FBI, he pointed out that the First Amendment<br>
prohibited pre-publication censorship, and asked _me_ for a written<br>
complaint, even though the LV article was in blatant breach of the US<br>
Intelligence Identities Protection Act.<br>
<p>
<p>
    At that time, the Reagan administration was apparently trying by means of<br>
National Security Directive D84 to get powers of prior restraint on<br>
publishing, in violation of the US Constitutional guarantees of freedom of<br>
the press.  I received hints that if Chris Tame and/or his wife Judy and/or<br>
myself had been attacked or killed by 'terrorists' this would have been most<br>
helpful to passage of such further measures.<br>
<p>
<p>
    Since then, Brady and and some of his associates have received tens of<br>
thousands of dollars from Institute for Humane Studies-linked funds. (This<br>
may be what I.H.S. (a Koch front) calls "recruiting intelligence officers for<br>
freedom:" paying America's enemies to attack America's friends).<br>
<p>
<p>
    Since then, my telephone has been monitored and obstructed (obtrusively);<br>
my mail has been opened or 'disappeared' (obtrusively); someone with SIGINT<br>
knowledge may explain more about the monitoring of word processor<br>
radiofrequencies. Other unusual and unpleasant incidents have occurred.<br>
<p>
<p>
17 November 1982: Ashford, Kent; My friend Andrew Robert Dennett, whom I used<br>
to accompany to church when he was five years old, was found dying of cyanide<br>
poisoning. He was 19 years old. I learnt of this after receiving a letter<br>
from Steele's associate Steven Berry, at ESOC Darmstadt, West Germany,<br>
referring to "a leather-bound set of the Encyclopaedia Brittanica." This was<br>
a gift given by me to Andrew, Peter and Terence Dennett when they were<br>
children, at Christmastime in 1969.<br>
<p>
    The existence of a cassette tape-recording was pointed out to me, and I<br>
asked Andrew's step-father for it; I then listened to the recording, made by<br>
Andrew prior to his death.  Andrew Dennett had recorded his belief thast his<br>
life was being destroyed, as well as his fear that he was going to be<br>
murdered, and naming those he feared were going to kill him as Klara Barrett<br>
and his step-father Michael Dickens (a Freedom Association member). The<br>
existence of this tape-recording was notified to New Scotland Yard within 24<br>
hours; the interviewing officers' existence was denied; there was no<br>
follow-up at all.<br>
<p>
<p>
13 October 1983; Margaret H. Thatcher's birthday. My pet cat Beeper's<br>
still-warm and floppy dead body was handed to me in a black polythene bag at<br>
6 o'clock in the evening at the local Veterinary Hospital. I had been told<br>
that Beeper had died 'under anaesthesia' at 10 o'clock that morning. A "vet"<br>
was obliged to leave the country a few days later for illegally 'operating on<br>
human beings.' [I had asked 'Dr.' Robert Lefever for a 'second opinion.'<br>
<p>
    In the same week, George Miller's car was rammed. Coincidentally, Two<br>
cars hired by Jeremy Shearmur from Hertz had mechanical failures. Jeremy's <br>
a skeptic.<br>
<p>
[1984] 14 Jan; After spending the evening with Jeremy Shearmur, I was<br>
attacked, head-butted and maliciously injured in Croydon Road, Beckenham,<br>
while trying to arrest a man who had attacked and injured my landlord's son.<br>
The police were called, and seemed very uninterested. After 15 minutes they<br>
were persuaded to note a description of the attacker. They were not heard<br>
from again.<br>
<p>
<p>
    7 February 1984; Andrew Dennett's brother Terry was hospitalised with a<br>
broken neck in New South Wales, Australia, after his car was rammed in a<br>
head-on crash by an identical stolen BMW, registration no. BS 201. (BS 201<br>
happens to be the basic CIA file descriptor).  Both cars were destroyed by<br>
fire. The other driver disappeared. This happened one year to the day after<br>
Brady's associate Michael Zegarac issued a document mentioning "measures" he<br>
and his associates would be taking, and one year to the day after Jorge<br>
Amador's "Better Red than Dead" article was published in the US.<br>
<p>
<p>
    July 1984; All mention of these events was censored from the publication<br>
"Free Life: The Journal of the Libertarian Alliance", which I edited, after I<br>
had sent the copy for the issue to the printers. This was done on the<br>
instructions of Jillian Becker, the self-styled "terrorism" expert and <br>
RENAMO apologist.<br>
<p>
<p>
    [1985] As confirmed by John Warden, the Daily Express Political Editor,<br>
abuse and disinformation instigated by Mr. John Selwyn Gummer and his<br>
associates at Conservative Central Office, and directed against conservatives<br>
and libertarians as well as the Libertarian alliance, was published on the<br>
front page of the Daily Express, on national ITV news, and elsewhere. By this<br>
time I had ceased work on medical advice, with a diagnosis of "stress<br>
reaction." My employment was subsequently lost. The Daily Express paid<br>
four-figure sums in damages to Chris Tame and Madsen Pirie.<br>
<p>
<p>
    A man was charged with and convicted of arson with intent to endanger <br>
life after another fire-bombing at the Alternative Bookshop, while Brian<br>
Micklethwait was staying there. On the very same day, the "private-sector"<br>
doctor R. Lefever (another "Freedom Association" member, whose stated concern<br>
for "state secrecy" seems to exceed his concern for the well-being of the<br>
patients who pay him) was telling me I was being "paranoid" and that I was<br>
"imagining" these incidents (having previously told me the very same<br>
incidents (including the three 'non-accidental' deaths) were connected in a<br>
way I would never discover, being part of a "plot" being perpetrated by "the<br>
KGB", based at 9, Poland Street, London W1, according to him, who were<br>
"trying to drive us crazy" as part of a plan to diminish the effectiveness of<br>
anyone opposing the KGB).<br>
<p>
<p>
    Counter-Information Services, the UK affiliate of Transnational Institute<br>
(the international wing of the American Institute for Policy Studies), as<br>
well as the Tory Reform Group, also used 9, Poland Street, which was<br>
controlled by the Rowntree Trust. The Rowntree Trust, (which with Keith<br>
Joseph also took part in establishing the Centre for Policy Studies), had<br>
Chitnis as chairman at the time. Chitnis is also a close associate of David<br>
Steel, the Liberal Party politician.<br>
<p>
    Since that time, further unpleasant incidents have occurred.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
    The cumulative effect of being subjected to this continued misconduct,<br>
without adequate defence or support, has been to deplete my resources of<br>
skills and intellectual and financial capital, and to make it almost<br>
impossible to plan ahead with any confidence so as to earn a living. I am<br>
presently receiving prescribed mild tranquillizers (to mitigate anxiety) and<br>
prescribed anti-depressants (to mitigate a profound sense of grief at having<br>
my life, my relationships and my life-chances damaged). And those are the<br>
only drugs I have had anything to do with (to my knowledge). I am at this<br>
time disabled and unable to work, with a diagnosis of reactive depression<br>
and/or post-traumatic stress disorder.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
    The response of the "Conservative" government to these and other<br>
incidents has been quite disgracefully negligent, inadequate as well as<br>
incompetent. I do know that I have not done anything injurious to anyone. We<br>
might have expected that the authorities would help us to resolve the<br>
problems, and that they would at least try to provide adequate safety<br>
measures and restitution. So much for "defending freedom." So much for "the<br>
Rule of Law."<br>
<p>
<p>
    As the Tory Government allows this country's free-society intellectual<br>
activists to be messed around like this, it is not really surprising that<br>
their policies continue to lose support by the day. If the abilities and<br>
energies and resources of our "brightest and best" are dissipated by such<br>
unpleasantness, is it any wonder that our country has so many unsolved<br>
problems? Or that people become reluctant to speak out in defence of a free<br>
society, with disastrous consequences for the quality of life and the<br>
prospects for any real national security?<br>
<p>
<p>
    It is a matter for some regret that, after so many years of effort trying<br>
to make this a country where individual freedom, ability, courage,<br>
independent thought and civilized behaviour are respected, valued and<br>
protected, I should have to say, with very considerable regret, that for me,<br>
the "Thatcher Years" proved to be an unnecessarily costly and miserably<br>
disappointing failure.<br>
<p>
<p>
    I think it is fair to say that what has been going on in this country<br>
does not come close to measuring up to the standards of administration for an<br>
Open Society which Karl Popper could have considered to be anywhere near<br>
satisfactory.<br>

<p>
        One Dr. Robert Lefever made an appalling mess of my life for a <br>
while. I was a paying customer, BTW.  The Secretariat of the Ethics <br>
Committee of the GMC _asked me to make a formal complaint_, after my <br>
enquiry had been 'bounced' by a hack staffer who told me 'nothing we can <br>
do.'  The Committee then said there was nothing they could do, after all.  <br>
Surprise, surprise.  Lefever has (or had) some very prominent and <br>
influential Thatcherite Conservatives as patients.<br>
<p>
<p>
        He told me that my aunt (who was found dead in a river outside <br>
Glenside Hospital an hour after her consultant had informed me of a <br>
'mistaken diagnosis' -- a diagnosis that resulted in massive electroshock <br>
and wholly inappropriate drug 'treatment' for her supposed 'thyroid <br>
disorder') had been killed.  She was actually suffering from a botched knee <br>
operation. Negligence lawsuits, anyone?  I was told by a senior adviser to <br>
10 Downing Street that all the relevant witnesses would be issued with <br>
immunity certificates, to prevent them being subpoena'd and compelled to <br>
testify.  Sound familiar?<br>
<p>
<p>
        He told me that her husband had also _not_ died accidentally.<br>
<p>
        He told me that my young friend Andrew Dennett had been killed <br>
(Andrew had been found dying of cyanide poisoning on november 17, 1982. He <br>
left a tape recording stating his belief that he was going to be murdered. <br>
 I notified this to Special Branch at NSY.  Nothing was done -- no <br>
follow-up at all.  The first time this information appeared on the <br>
Coroner's file was around the time that Thatcher resigned).<br>
<p>
        He told me 'the KGB' were involved, and that he had access to <br>
'secret information'  confirming this, which was denied to me.<br>
<p>
        Imagine, if you can, being told that three people you loved had <br>
been murdered to 'get at' you because of your _political activities_, and <br>
thant there was _nothing_ you could do about it.<br>
<p>
        Oh, (and the least of my problems), he stuck something violently <br>
into my 'back passage' without bothering to ask for my informed consent <br>
first.  I hadn't visited him with any problems in that region of my <br>
anatomy. In the States, this can constitute felony rape.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
        Lefever now owns and runs a vastly costly 'addiction treatment <br>
unit' in Kent. According to the Professor of Psychiatry who examined the <br>
Unit, he utilizes Sargant's 'conversion' techniques (i.e. brainwashing), <br>
which physiologically alters brain functions by imposing unbearable stress.<br>
 <br>
        His patients may be referred by the police or the courts, or their <br>
parents, or their employers, or the government.  Or, they may be told that <br>
the alternatives to attending his 'Unit' for his 'treatment' may be very <br>
unpleasant.  And that, should they try to _leave_ during 'treatment'...<br>
<p>
        This constitutes an ethical basis for _informed consent_?<br>
<p>
        If someone were to get their 'jollies' making people suffer, or <br>
watching them suffer, what a great place to work!  According to their <br>
office, _all_ the staff are (or were) 'graduates' of his treatment regime. <br>
He wants to sue for libel? Well, I (and others) can always counter-claim.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
        According to 'The Dictionary of Espionage' (Stein and Day, New <br>
York), MI6 have a Section, P4, which recruits doctors, lawyers, and other <br>
'professionals' as informants and operatives, in grotesque breach of <br>
professional ethics and the hippocratic oath.<br>

Check out Professor Lawrence Weed's diagnostic software and treatment <br>
systems.  He's at the University of Vermont.  It's truly brilliant work.<br>

Interleaved comment here:<br>
<p>
Lefever stole the PROMIS medical information system name, told his <br>
patients he was using it, and completely failed to provide any of the <br>
elements of the PROMIS procedures: He calls himself PROMIS medical <br>
services.<br>
<p>
[1] Full printed copy of all symptoms detected provided to the patient.<br>
<p>
[2] Full copy of diagnosis, and rationale for recommended treatment <br>
procedures ditto.<br>
<p>
[3] Full monitoring of treatment outcome(s) with copy to patient.<br>
<p>
<p>
No-one I know ever received _any of this_.<br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Imagine, if you can, being told that three people you loved had </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; been murdered to 'get at' you</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I can imagine being told, as you relate, but I find it hard to believe. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do *you* believe it?</i><br>
<p>
I did then.  I _trusted_ the man.  And this was all in the context of the <br>
'Cold War', and some pretty hideous things happening to me directly.  A <br>
lot of our worst fears had eventuated.<br>
<p>
I was terrified of even _discussing_ all this for years.<br>

<p>
Now, I've considered and discussed so many possiblities, it's hard to be <br>
certain any more.  A Public Inquiry might get to the bottom of it all.  <br>
The maddening thing is that the necessary information and reports are on <br>
file with MI5, MI6 and CIA, just for starters.<br>
<p>
But that won't happen, I'd guess.  For rather obvious reasons....<br>
<p>
I have a 20k. ASCII file available on all this, BTW.   A chronology.<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; because of your _political activities_, </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; what activities were these, Tony?</i><br>
<p>
Inter alia:<br>
<p>
I was and am an active individualist radical liberal, associated with <br>
other like-minded people, including anarchists of various hues.   We were <br>
valuable to the intellectual architects of what became known as <br>
'Thatcherism' -- Chris R. Tame worked at the Freedom Association, and the <br>
Centre for Policy Studies.   David Ramsay Steele did some work for Keith <br>
Joseph, whom I'd met several times, along with Geoffrey Howe and various <br>
other 'name' political figures.<br>
<p>
<p>
Without acting under their direction or control, or beinmg paid for it, <br>
some of us might just on occasion have helped MI6 and CIA folk in <br>
smuggling 'subversive' literature into various despotic countries.  All <br>
part of the 'War of Ideas.'  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
We had the Alternative Bookshop, with something to attract (and offend) <br>
everyone.  Firebombings.  Death threats.  Window-smashings.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From 1978 to 1980, (even though i was summarily fired in July 1979), I </i><br>
worked as Office Services Manager for the Freedom Association &lt;sigh&gt;, <br>
described by Thatcher as 'probably the most effective organization <br>
fighting for our freedoms in Britain today.'  Ref: Hugo Young, 'One of <br>
Us', p. 111<br>
<p>
Also, see Brian Crozier's recent book 'Free Agent', and LOBSTER 11.<br>
<p>
<p>
I was fired for giving a talk on libertarian ideas during my holiday (!), <br>
to a 'Free Society' Summer School organized by the UK end of the Heritage <br>
Foundation in Washington, at the invitation of the organizers.  <br>
<p>
One of the participants was Ernest van den Haag, a US academic who was a <br>
police witness in the judicial murder of Lenny Bruce, the comedian.. <br>
<p>
Assistant Attorney General in the case, Vincent Cuccia said: "We knew what <br>
we were doing.  We drove him into poverty and bankruptcy ... We watched <br>
him fall apart. We used the law to kill him.'<br>

<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<p>
Then we started the Libertarian Alliance, to further our own ideas.<br>
<p>
Hey, ho!<br>
<p>
<p>
So we were upsetting lots of people, you see:<br>
<p>
[1] MI5, who are an immiscible culture vis-a-vis MI6.   [The TV series <br>
'The Prisoner' portrays this brilliantly. Written by George Markstein, <br>
senior MI6 officer... ]  MI5 exists to prevent radical change in this <br>
country -- _any_ kind of radical change.  It's rather good at it.<br>
<p>
[2] The Marxist 'Left', who disliked our market economics and our <br>
anti-collectivist bias, and our aversion to Statism and determinism.<br>
<p>
[3]The Fascist Right, who hated our position on race, immigration, <br>
individual liberty, and freedom of thought and expression.<br>
<p>
and 'SEARCHLIGHT' magazine, which manages to combine all three of these...<br>
<p>
<p>
The authoritarian Tories:<br>
<p>
The authoritarian elements in the Police.<br>
<p>
<p>
The list is not exhaustive...  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and that there was _nothing_ you could do about it.</i><br>
<p>
Inter alia, Madsen Pirie, President of the Adam Smith Institute, told me <br>
this.  It seems to be true, doesn't it?  We used to be friends.  I used to <br>
be invited to his birthday dinners.  Not any more.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; this, I find impossible to imagine. If these murders were committed, and </i><br>
<i>&gt; if there was a coverup, then I am sure there's not a cixen here who </i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't offer to help see justice done.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can start with me</i><br>
<p>
Always remember, you did ask.  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
There quite certainly have been a _series_ of 'coverups.'  Quite what of, <br>
is not entirely certain.<br>
<p>
If my aunt and God-mother had been deliberately tortured to death in the <br>
most hideous manner, it would have looked no different to what actually <br>
happened.<br>
<p>
Check out the ongoing case of the hideous death of JonBenet Ramsey on the <br>
Web, and you will understand rather better, why it is that some people are <br>
_extraordinarily_ reluctant to talk about various things.<br>
<p>
[What was her father involved with?  Her death has all the hallmarks of a <br>
'demonstration' killing.]<br>
<p>
Check out the death of Patricia Luna Wilson (writer Robert Anton Wilson's <br>
daughter) who was found battered to death, aged just 15, with a bloodied <br>
MasterCharge machine lying next to her.  "For a few dollars more..."<br>
<p>
Would anyone here want this sort of thing to happen to _their_ family?<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
I notified details of the circumstances of Andrew Dennett's death, and the <br>
tape recording he left behind, to Special Branch at NSY immediately upon <br>
learning of it, and hearing the tape (a hideous experience -- <br>
'Schrechtlichkeit', as the Germans say).  I was told that the name I gave, <br>
of the senior SB officer who interviewed me at Beckenham Police Station on <br>
13 January, 1983, _didn't exist_.  I called several times.  Got me <br>
no-where. No follow-up at all.<br>
<p>
<p>
Three other witnesses heard this tape also.  I didn't 'imagine it.'<br>
<p>
[The SB officer was Detective Inspector Ray Dowd.  He certainly does <br>
exist. I spoke with a colleague of his just the other day.  _So why was I <br>
repeatedly told by the SB switchboard they had no officer of that name on <br>
the staff?_]<br>
<p>
<p>
I notified the Ashford Coroner's Office three times.  The relevant person <br>
was 'on holiday' or 'away for the day' or the safe was locked and someone <br>
else had the keys (rather apt, that).<br>
<p>
<p>
A police officer friend of mine, David Hedges, tried three times to <br>
contact the Kent Police to get them 'on the case', apparently without <br>
success.  Coincidentally, he was busted off the Force a bit later, on some <br>
pretext or other.  <br>
<p>
Even more coincidentally, his youngest son was killed in a motorcycle <br>
smash a couple of years later.  He was around Andrew's age. Maybe just <br>
another 'accident.'<br>
<p>
MPs and senior Government advisers in Britain and the US have been told. <br>
Nothing happened.  Zilch.  It's the _total lack of response_ tht's <br>
interesting.<br>
<p>
          ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
In 1990, , I gave a signed written statement by way of complaint to <br>
Bristol Special Branch. I was asked sternly:  'Why haven't you raised this <br>
before?'  [ROFL!!!]<br>
<p>
The officer said he'd get back to me with the Coroner's reports.  He <br>
'vanished' too, and was not seen again.  He was promptly moved to another <br>
post.  But the details of the tape etc. appeared on the Coroner's file on <br>
Andrew's death at that time.<br>
<p>
Thatcher resigned pretty well at the same time.  Coincidence, no doubt).<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
At the request of his Personal Private Secretary, I sent a 20k. Fax copy <br>
to Douglas Hurd's personal fax number at the Foreign Secretary's office at <br>
the Foreign Office.  He announced his retirement from politics a little <br>
bit later. Just another coincidence, no doubt.  Ask him why there was no <br>
follow-up, and the man I spoke with about this was posted out of the <br>
country, to Hong Kong.<br>
<p>
<p>
'Coverups'?  On _this_ scale?  What sort of country do you think we've <br>
got here, Peter?  <br>
<p>
<p>
Fire up your Search Engines.<br>
<p>
Do a Web Search for 'November 17' to start with.  The date of Andrew's <br>
death.  Someone's 'calling card', perhaps?  Such things do happen.<br>
<p>
Do some 'NameBase' searches, and check out the links and contexts.<br>
<p>
Then check out 'Robert Moss' (who was chucked out of the Freedom <br>
Association -- then named 'The National Association for Freedom.' a bit <br>
before I went to work at its HQ).<br>
<p>
Then 'Richard Welch'<br>
<p>
Then 'Larry McDonald'<br>
<p>
Then 'CounterSpy'<br>
<p>
Then 'Transnational Institute'<br>
<p>
Then 'Heritage Foundation'<br>
<p>
[ Then 'Edwin J. Feulner' ]<br>
<p>
<p>
Then we'll talk some more.<br>
<p>
'Good Hunting', all!<br>
<p>
Best Wishes,<br>
<p>
Tony<br>
