Lee, you are obviously a highly rational person with a strong grasp of<br>
objective reality. What you say is correct, it is emotional backlash, so I<br>
am not going to waste our time arguing about my motives.<br>
<p>
I respect the fact that, though you present highly rational ideas in<br>
this forum, you are not in here to inflate your own ego, which is more<br>
than can be said for several others on this list. Extropy is not about<br>
being admired by others - this is the fuel that creates cults - it is<br>
about the advancement of humanity.<br>
