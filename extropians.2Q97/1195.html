I was actually less radical, trying to delegate the task of sifting and<br>
sorting to an external artifical agency, which first learns by looking<br>
over my shoulder, then gets progressively more autonomous. I'd like to<br>
have a newsfeed continuously available, which requires a cell-linked<br>
wearable, and a headup. Btw headup, TI now offers a MDM beamer kit, but<br>
it's much too expensive yet (6k$, or so).<br>

<i>&gt; &gt; [ attention load leveling ]</i><br>

I think we _need_ periods of vita activa/contemplativa. Just maxing out<br>
the load might blunt down you concepts/reduce overall processivity. I do<br>
my best work when I deliberately isolate my self from the environment,<br>
though I haven't tried out the proverbial cabin in the woods yet. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; There is a qualitative difference between "transportable computing" (I can</i><br>
<i>&gt; carry my computer anywhere, but only use it while I'm sitting down plugged</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the appropriate power and phone jacks) vs. "continuously online" (I</i><br>
<p>
This is very good for work, when you need to make last-second changes to<br>
the software when out in the field (I recently had a problem out at the<br>
BMW research center, where there was no adequate IT infrastructure, it<br>
would have taken 30 sec to fix, but so it required a trip through the<br>
congested city), but I am thinking more towards an augmented reality,<br>
rendered by a wearable. The Wintel cartel has not been contemplating <br>
these yet, though it is only a question of time. Another opportunity lost <br>
to big business :(<br>

<i>&gt; can, at any instant, give my computer a bit of data to remember, or have it</i><br>
<i>&gt; beep at me with a reminder message indicating what the alarm was about, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; ... instant response, without waiting to boot up ... the Apple Newton</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept).</i><br>
<p>
I have got a Newt 130, which looks like a prototype in relation to a Newt<br>
2000 I've recently toyed with. The later lacks belt wearability, a colour<br>
headup, and speech input still for a killer app. True wearables are at<br>
least a decade off. Whoever has the resouces, should contemplate building<br>
one. The MIT wearable group had some Linux-based wearables, which I<br>
thought an overkill at the time, but a better machine would lack the<br>
software basis Linux has. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [...] </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;once the Linux box is done</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Amazing coincidence, I've been setting up a Linux box in my house.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Nothing terribly complicated; I bought Debian on a CD-ROM ... I hit one</i><br>
<p>
The Rat Head (Red Hat) distribution seems to offer a good value for the<br>
money, their installer and the Accelerated X considered. I will be<br>
sticking with S.u.S.E. Linux for the next time, though. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; little glitch, but When I Get Around To It, I think I can make one little</i><br>

I guess I will simply dump the raw hard disk image to the streamer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; [ email dbase ] </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, I have stacks of floppies laying around. I have decided that I want</i><br>
<i>&gt; *all* my information online; I am willing to pay extra to buy a</i><br>
<i>&gt; adequately-sized hard drive to hold *all* my information rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; shuffle it in and out on removable media.</i><br>
<p>
Yes. I consider buying a scanner, and OCRing most of my multi-K treekiller<br>
infobase into a digital medium, best accessible as a wearable. So far,<br>
hard disks are not large enough. But soon....<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (I still shuffle CD-ROMs in and out ... but I rationalize and say that is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not "my" information)</i><br>
<p>
I will buy a CD changer quite soon. I'd wish the multi-TByte holographic <br>
storage units were already here....<br>

<i>&gt; While this seems like a good idea, I haven't really seen any good</i><br>
<i>&gt; general-purpose implementations. (I've seen a few pretty-good ad-hoc</i><br>
<p>
I was speaking about the wetware implementations.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; implementations -- fresh new mailing lists before they get bogged down in</i><br>
<i>&gt; spam or flamewars). Moderated Usenet Newsgroups are the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; general-purpose implementation I've seen, but there seems to be something</i><br>
<i>&gt; missing. There must be a better way.</i><br>
<p>
I guess there is. Let's invent one, in a pinch.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I volunteer for a scanner. Anybody else?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Me !</i><br>
<p>
Great. I was thinking about dividing several mailing lists/usenet<br>
newsgroups around persons with similiar interests, who bounce messages<br>
they consider interesting to a _small selection_ of mailing lists. E.g.<br>
classes involing alternative energy, nanotechnology, cryonics, or whatever<br>
other sorting bins a vote among scanners might result (an important point,<br>
this). This feed going into web-accessible archives cum a full text<br>
index/search engine, the whole shebang being later to be financed via<br>
digicash by the subscriber. <br>
 <br>
But initially, this to be run purely on a nonprofit basis. I guess we <br>
could achieve interesting results with just 2-5 scanner volunteers, <br>
probably using Extropy Institute's planned new infrastructure. Hence, I<br>
am CCing this to the extropy list. Anyone more joining "A Scanner Darkly" <br>
throng?<br>
