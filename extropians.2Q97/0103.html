<p>
Of course we respect individuals choice in the roles they chose. And the way<br>
they bring up their children. This thread is not about enforcing gender<br>
roles, it is about rationally analyzing them. Choosing values instead of<br>
accepting ( perhaps not so useful?) traditional ones without thinking.<br>
<p>
' We' is a word which can be inclusive of one or more persons. How we should<br>
do things is a very rational topic , from businesses - to families, to<br>
societies, to individuals, and it is not 'collectivist'. That would entail<br>
enforcing our ways upon you. Coercion has not been suggested.<br>
 I would see extropians as one rational  "we" (group), and also my wife and<br>
I, or my society and I, and "we' are always discussing how things should be<br>
done. Even Objectivists and Libertarians talk about how "we" do things.<br>
Can we talk about what "we" should do about space exploration? Freedom of<br>
speech? Technological advances?<br>

<i>&gt;how to deal with others openly, honestly, and fairly to achieve</i><br>
<i>&gt;whatever his ends might be.</i><br>
 <br>
Changing how we do things, especially as "A SOCIETY", is helpul, for<br>
dysfuntional societies form a large part of the darwinistic pool against (or<br>
with ) which our individual concepts must swim.<br>
To censor a forum about such an important issue, especially one that involves<br>
our future- as children do- is IMHO, more collectivist than allowing free<br>
speech. <br>
