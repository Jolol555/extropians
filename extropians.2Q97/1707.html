<i>&gt;&gt; But not every bra has a cryptographic function. Most are used for ASCII </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; armor or for compression. Some are even designed to make the plaintext</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stand out and more enjoyable to read.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Touche, but I believe what we have here is a clear case of steganography.</i><br>
<p>
Yikes.  I think that we should hammer down some definitions before<br>
this whole thing gets out of hand.<br>
<p>
Cryptography:<br>
Building an difficult-to-unhook bra.<br>
<p>
Steganography:<br>
Building a flesh-colored bra, or one whose unhook mechanism is<br>
hidden somewhere unexpected (Man:  "How the Hell...?"  Woman:<br>
"It unhooks in front."  Man:  "Damn those steganographers.")<br>
<p>
Public-Key Cryptography:<br>
Building a bra that anyone can put on, but that only Alice can<br>
remove.<br>
<p>
Watermarking:<br>
Building a bra that stays on even after smoothing, compression,<br>
and rotation.  Also, Bob should not be able to put his own bra<br>
on over Alice's and claim ownership of her body.<br>
<p>
Fingerprinting:<br>
Um, I'm probably already in trouble for the last one, so I'll<br>
just skip this.<br>
<p>
Signatures:<br>
Building a bra with a nametag ("Property of Alice, machine wash<br>
warm...") such that bras with Alice's name only fit Alice's body.<br>
Bob could in theory remove Alice's bra and replace it with his <br>
own, but there's no real reason for him to do so.<br>
<p>
All-or-Nothing Disclosure Of Secrets:<br>
Alice transforms her bra into a duffle bag, and either (a) shows<br>
Bob how to open it, or (b) shows Bob how she made it into a duffle<br>
bag.  Alice repeats the procedure until Bob is satisfied (perverted<br>
freak).<br>
<p>
One-time Pad:<br>
Kleenex.<br>
<p>
NSA:	An organization that wants women to go back to wearing corsets and<br>
chastity belts.  Oh, and Bill Clinton gets to keep all the keys.<br>
<p>
[looks up at what's written so far and sighs]  I'm so damned juvenile.<br>
I'm going to go do something more constructive and serious.  Well, happy<br>
Monday.<br>
<p>
