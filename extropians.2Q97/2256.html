     Hara Ra responded to one of my less recent attempts to eliminate =20 <br>
     incidents in my resultant messages:<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Please don't do this. I read my email straight through, and jumping<br>
     around, decoding files, etc, etc to read what you have to say means <br>
     only<br>
     one thing:<br>
     <br>
      I DON'T READ IT<br>
     <br>
     If you want to be read, DO THE TRANSLATION TO ASCII YOURSELF and post <br>
     it<br>
     as<br>
     plain ole email.<br>
     <br>
     Flame! Grouch! Unprintable!<br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     It was an experiement, one I discovered quickly didn't work.  Got a <br>
     new version of ccMail that I *thought* was causing the problem but <br>
     then it went away.  (Machine gnomes making my wishes come true no <br>
     doubt).<br>
     <br>
     But may I interpret your displeasure with my tactic as a desire to <br>
     read my posts.  Of many of the respondents on this digest, there seems <br>
     to be an unspoken affinity with a fellow Santa Cruzan (me, formerly). <br>
     &lt;G&gt;<br>
