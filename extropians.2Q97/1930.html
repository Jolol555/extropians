No, there is no point (and actually a bit dishonest) to present two<br>
images (a bit like scientology starting out as self-help training and<br>
then turning into a religion). I leave secret teachings for the<br>
initiates of the inner order to the cults. <br>
<p>
It makes a lot of difference if the first impression people have of<br>
transhumanism is somebody speaking about how you can become<br>
smarter/happier/more long lived through some fairly simple tricks<br>
(especially if they can be demonstrated easily) or if it somebody<br>
speaking of uploading oneself into a computer and colonizing the<br>
entire universe. The latter is so far-out that it doesn't matter<br>
other than conversation fodder (if even that), the former is<br>
downright interesting, and can in time lead to discussions about<br>
basic transhumanist philosophy and other practical self-enhancing<br>
methods. <br>
<p>
As I see it, there are three groups of people we want to reach: the<br>
people who are or will become transhumanists, the people who think<br>
transhumanism is a good thing, and the people who accept<br>
transhumanism as a valid view, even if they disagree with it. We need<br>
to enlarge the last group if we are to be able to make our voices<br>
heard in the debate, otherwise we will be seen as simply some lunatic<br>
fringe group of no importance. The second group is of course<br>
important to get public support. Compare this to the environmental<br>
movement: practically everyone today agrees that environmental issues<br>
are relevant, many support environmentalism (albeit passively) and a<br>
small group is active environmentalists.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; The public image and presentation issue is tremendously important for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; future of our ideas. Apart from Anders' comments on the above questions, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; encourage everyone else to offer suggestions. How do we find the optimal</i><br>
<i>&gt; path between being boring/blending in with other ideas, and standing</i><br>
<i>&gt; out/looking scary.</i><br>
<p>
As a radical idea becomes more acceptable it seems to go through<br>
different phases. At first people find it crazy or ridicullous. Then<br>
it becomes scary and people get angry about it. Then it is new and<br>
suddenly completely mainstream. We have moved from crazy to scary,<br>
and that is a good thing. But there is no doubt that we have<br>
turbulent weather ahead. <br>
