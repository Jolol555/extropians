Subject: Lifespan extension and the existence of soul<br>
<p>
     Greetings all,<br>
     <br>
     As I've noticed one extropian aspiration is physical life extension <br>
     which I'm all for (actually quality of life over quantity of years <br>
     seems preferable but if we shaped up our act as a society, I might be <br>
     persuaded to stay on the planet longer &lt;G&gt;).  I've been recently taken <br>
     with the notion that it would be quite ironic that right about the <br>
     time we cinch the mortality issues and can extend physical human life <br>
     indefinitely through our technology, we will also have discovered a <br>
     spectrum of energy that could/will be defined as consciousness or, <br>
     more classically, the soul.  <br>
     <br>
     I've rather casually associated a metaphor of a laser with a <br>
     "self-aware discarnate entity".  The laser, being a concentrated beam <br>
     of photon energy, the uses of which continue to revolutionize our way <br>
     of life and our "self", also seemingly a concentration of thought and <br>
     potent awareness.  Though lasers they have been found to exist in <br>
     nature, our discovery and harnessing of them and how they work has <br>
     given us another tool in our ongoing discovery of "fire".  One step up <br>
     the ladder, monkey boys! (think Lithgow in Buckaroo Bonzai).  Perhaps <br>
     a discovery that self is not just an contrivance of our desperate <br>
     ego-based, and physically bound existence but more an instinctual <br>
     knowing that we have been and always will be (maybe it's something <br>
     that is a "Known" right down to the quantum level but that we can't <br>
     yet prove).<br>
     <br>
     I'm presently not very well read on the myths of all cultures but in <br>
     the Judeo-Christian motif out of which many people in Western Civ have <br>
     emerged, self-awareness is the first energy mentioned in Genesis, that <br>
     self-awareness being "God" (not compelling religious discussion here) <br>
     who then spoke (vibrated) light.  Archetypes, regardless of the <br>
     validity one might attach to them, are fascinating in how they take on <br>
     an iconic position in culture.  Could self-awareness, of what was <br>
     primitively regarded as Godhood be just around the corner in our <br>
     scientific understanding?  <br>
     <br>
     My latest reading project is "A Brief History of Everything" by Ken <br>
     Wilber and his theory of holarchy (every "thing" has the <br>
     characteristics of being a part and a whole) is quite fascinating.  <br>
     I'm quite busy and I read slowly (it's because I'm a writer/editor I <br>
     imagine...can't quickly gulp up concept because the structure of words <br>
     is so preoccupying my thought process) so it'll be a while before I'm <br>
     done with the book but I wouldn't mind anyone who has read the book <br>
     piping up with some of their thoughts on it.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Digging beyond the gut-level response, I'll admit that I had reservations</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for many years about bringing a child into the world.  Look around - the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; forces of big government seem to be entrenched around the world, children</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are being shot on the streets and in schools, couples are having to work </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; harder to make ends meet, etc.  I could go on and on.  It seems like the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; world is going down the toilet, and that things just aren't as good as </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they were when I was growing up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	We have none of that where we live.  Merchants take a two-hour</i><br>
<i>&gt; lunch and leave their outdoor displays and goods in place,</i><br>
<i>&gt; unguarded.  The stores leave such things as fertilizer, wood,</i><br>
<i>&gt; potting soil outside, unguarded at all times.</i><br>
<p>
I must say that even here in New York City, life isn't too bad. The<br>
continues to be run by socialists, but crime is not a particular day<br>
to day worry (the murder rate is down to mid 1960s levels), work is<br>
plentiful, and rent control may even end on June 15th if the<br>
Republicans in the State Senate have the balls to go through with what<br>
they've threatened -- if rent control goes away, housing prices will<br>
likely drop and the city will probably experience a renaissance of<br>
sorts.<br>
<p>
In general, I'm optimistic. Unlike any other time in human history,<br>
there is a low but good chance that we'll solve the aging problem<br>
before I drop dead, and I'm signed up for cryonics just in<br>
case. Business prospects for thinking people are better than ever<br>
before, and money nearly litters the streets provided you have the<br>
brains to pick it up.<br>
<p>
The odds of global thermonuclear war are down (although the odds of<br>
nuclear terrorism are up), and technology continues to develop<br>
unabated, leading to interesting results for all of us within fifty<br>
years or so.<br>
<p>
All in all, a good time to be alive.<br>

Subject: Distant Gamma Ray Burster Nailed<br>
<p>
On Wed, 14 May 1997, Robin Hanson forwarded a message called "Caltech <br>
Astronomers Crack the Puzzle of Cosmic Gamma-Ray Bursts" which noted:<br>
&lt;Competing theories on gamma-ray bursts generally fall into two types: <br>
one, which supposes the bursts to originate from some as-yet unknown <br>
population of objects within our own Milky Way galaxy, and another, <br>
which proposes that the bursts originate in distant galaxies, several <br>
billion light-years away.&gt;<br>
<p>
The message added:<br>
&lt;The results demonstrate for the first time that *at least some* of <br>
the enigmatic gamma-ray bursts that have puzzled astronomers for <br>
decades are extragalactic in origin.&gt;<br>
<p>
Emphasis mine.  There seems to be a healthy competition of ideas in <br>
this area. For example, the following comes from a 3 May 97 Science <br>
News article called "Milky Way's Heart Gushes Antimatter " and can be <br>
found at<br>
<a href="http://www.soundprint.org/sn_arc97/5_3_97/fob1.htm">http://www.soundprint.org/sn_arc97/5_3_97/fob1.htm</a><br>
<p>
&lt;New observations suggest that the heart of our galaxy pumps a <br>
fountain of antimatter and hot gas into the tenuous halo of material <br>
lying several thousand light-years above it. The discovery could <br>
dramatically alter astronomers' view of the Milky Way and how the <br>
hotbed of activity at the galaxy's center influences its farthest <br>
extremities. The fountain "provides a conduit between the galactic <br>
center and distant parts of the galaxy," says gamma-ray astronomer <br>
Charles D. Dermer of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in <br>
Washington, D.C. "This high-altitude feature . . . reveals how the <br>
core regulates the rest of the galaxy."&gt;<br>
<p>
Sounds to me like these gamma ray emissions may be just a normal part <br>
of galactic dynamics.<br>

<p>
Since I am also expecting my first and only biological child, I am also very<br>
interested in this question.  Newsweek has a special issue out now on child<br>
development, which has an overview of a number of recent breakthroughs in the<br>
study of infant brain development.  Things like, during a certain age period,<br>
the brain wires itself for recognizing phonemes.  People who are raised in<br>
households with different languages use different parts of their brains when<br>
hearing the same phonemes.  The example I've seen is differences in brain<br>
activity when hearing the "r" and "l" sounds, between english speakers and<br>
Japanese speakers.  In the former, the brain lights up in a couple physically<br>
distant spots, while in the latter it doesn't.<br>
<p>
It's becoming clear that from 0 to 3, the brain gets wired in many different<br>
ways, and this early wiring is both critical, and (so far as we know)<br>
irreproducible.  Pretty damn amazing stuff, and the article is highly<br>
recommended.  As the date approaches, I'll be searching out the primary<br>
sources.<br>

May I suggest that a few enterprising Extropians create a <br>

Yes indeed, as always.  Aside from the silly pseudo-theories, Wolf<br>

The gift is that I see, objectively, how much of the physical universe<br>

human life is meaningful and<br>
