<i>&gt;Since I first joined the Extropians list I have had to be disabused of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;number of fallacious notions.  General appeals to laws-of-whatever didn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;help.  Only being taken step by step through the process of determining</i><br>
<i>&gt;that 0 did not equal 1, and being shown where the error crept into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;proof that it did, allowed me to see that the impossible actually wasn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;true.  The Monty Hall door-choosing probability problem (on which I think</i><br>
<i>&gt;some people disagree to this day) also comes to mind, and there are others</i><br>
<i>&gt;that don't.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The point is that saying that something "violates the laws of physics"</i><br>
<i>&gt;doesn't convince people -- being open to input that seems to violate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;known laws is what allows people to discover new ones.  And calling the</i><br>
<i>&gt;people names *certainly* doesn't convince them.  Look at the proof</i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself, find the erroneous step, point it out, and explain where</i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary.  Just saying "there's an error there somewhere" is either</i><br>
<i>&gt;presumptuous, naive, or lazy, depending on the attitude with which it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;said.  Most things are obvious once you understand them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you can't calmly convince a single intelligent and sympathetic person</i><br>
<i>&gt;of where the law of conservation of energy is violated in this instance,</i><br>
<i>&gt;how do you expect to convince (mostly less intelligent and less</i><br>
<i>&gt;sympathetic) people of things more important to you?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Every time I see misunderstanding handled in such a dismissive and</i><br>
<i>&gt;contemptuous way, I think I gain further insight into why Extropianism</i><br>
<i>&gt;(with its cousin Libertarianism) hasn't taken the world by storm.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For people who wonder what the foofaraw is all about, and how people get</i><br>

<i>&gt;I just told AltaVista to find "car NEAR water NEAR fuel NEAR hydrogen" for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the first one, and "car NEAR water NEAR power" for the second.  Not very</i><br>
<i>&gt;good queries, but I came up with them in under a minute.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The world would probably be improved by a Web page debunking some of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;claims in the first one, without reference to name-calling.  I'd write</i><br>
<i>&gt;one myself, except that I don't know my physics well enough to explain</i><br>
<i>&gt;the matter clearly.</i><br>

Well put, Kennita.  I would just say, to balance it back the other way<br>
just slightly from where you leave it, that this is a list in which *<br>
critical thinking* is important.  I think Mike offered the car thing in a<br>
spirit of critical (political) thinking, and while that's great, and<br>
while I think his critics were a bit rude in a human sort of way, still,<br>
he's got to take the criticism seriously if he wants to participate in<br>
that critical spirit.  (The thing is, I'm sure his critics would have<br>
some sympathy with his political point in itself, to some extent -<br>
perhaps that might be a more interesting topic?)<br>
