<p>
For one, you seem to arguing that only "corporations" advertise: many<br>
businesses (like mine) are proud /not/ to be incorporated; we take<br>
full responsibility for the actions of our business, and demand our<br>
full rights as human beings.  Even in the case of a corporation, it<br>
can still be held responsible for fraud and slander just as a person<br>
can, and with that responsibility comes rights.  The two go together.<br>
Freedom implies responsibility, and vice versa.<br>
<p>
The fact that a corporation can weasel out of its responsility by<br>
declaring bankruptcy is no different from the fact that a person can<br>
too.  That's a problem, but it's a reason to change bankruptcy law,<br>
not the first admendment.<br>
