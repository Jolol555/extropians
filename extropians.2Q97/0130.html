<i>&gt;Yes its complex, but the time to bring expectations and actions into</i><br>

<i>&gt;that there seems to be little conversation on these topics. </i><br>
<p>
Well, discussion would help, but discussion is generally with highly selected<br>
groups.  You'd want people to know what other people, in the aggregate, are<br>
deciding, and surveys are far better for that.<br>
<p>
Another big problem with forecasting or discussion is that people often<br>
change their minds about what they want.  It's difficult for a 20-year-old in<br>
college who's never worked anything more than part-time casual work and who's<br>
never had a significant relationship or children (an awful lot of<br>
20-year-olds these days) to really have any good idea what they will want at<br>
40.  For example, a lot of career women change their minds and want kids when<br>
their biological clocks start going off in their 30's.  For another example,<br>
"Mid-life crisis" is a cliche.<br>
<p>
So my point is that we aren't going to have a good idea what people's<br>
long-term life choices are going to be if they don't follow traditional<br>
paths.  Surveying, planning, and discussion are all good things, but even<br>
ideal application of the above (unlikely) will leave us with a lot of<br>
uncertainty.<br>
