	I could not agree more. Fortunately, at least some Teachers Colleges<br>
are now emphasizing creative and critical thinking skills in the<br>
graduate school curriculum. My beautiful wife had to re-learn, in<br>
accordance with this new paradigm, much of what she had learned when she<br>
started teaching twenty-five years ago. As teachers learn to emphasize<br>
such things as thinking skills and cooperative education, I suspect that<br>
the curriculum will slowly evolve into one that will emphasize the<br>
skills of the post-industrial era we are gradually entering. There will<br>
be resistance to such changes, however. <br>
The politics involved in school boards and the intransigence of many in<br>
our social oligarchy who wish to attempt to maintain the status quo will<br>
probably result in a very slowly changing emphasis on skills that can<br>
and will cause a power shift towards less instinctive respect for<br>
presumed and landed authority. As usual, political change and social<br>
change will go hand in hand.<br>
