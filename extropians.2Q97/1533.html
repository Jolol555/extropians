<i>&gt; Friday night I was listening to a Bio prof talk about the monkeys he</i><br>
<i>&gt;  uses in his research.  They are rugged and damn smart, and are trained</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to help run each new experiment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  If any brand of AI researcher had a computer that good, they'd</i><br>
<i>&gt;  probably think they were very close to the holy grail.  But here we do</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have such computers, and we don't put them to much use besides</i><br>
<i>&gt;  studying their brains.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  So why is it exactly that we haven't trained such monkeys to do real</i><br>
<i>&gt;  jobs around in our society?  Couldn't they be trained to be security</i><br>
<i>&gt;  guards, to sweep streets, to wash cars, or to run machines in</i><br>
<i>&gt;  factories?  Yes language is important for many jobs, but for all jobs?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Sure they like to be with each other, but couldn't teams of monkeys</i><br>
<i>&gt;  work together?</i><br>
<p>
Phoned any technical support lines lately!?  You're right it's about time we<br>
gave animals a place in society.  This is like my idea of engineering bee's<br>
to make alternative food products (which I submitted under my former address<br>
MonkeyWAX@aol.com).  With genetic egineering we could make a variety of even<br>
more useful animals, and maybe even useful people!<br>
