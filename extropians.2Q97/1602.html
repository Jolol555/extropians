<p>
The 'them' in your last sentence refers to the species as a collective.<br>
Consider what the extinction/employment choice looks like to an individual<br>
ape: a risky life in the wild, leading perhaps to producing less than two<br>
offspring, versus life in a factory assembling toilet brushes.  Any<br>
reasonable ape would prefer the former.  Since I don't believe in oppresing<br>
individuals for the good of the species, I don't think your argument has<br>
moral force.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I don't extend the full spectrum of human rights to<br>
nonhuman apes, so if you want to oppress apes, it's probably OK by me.  Just<br>
don't argue that it's for their own good.<br>
