<i>&gt; From: Sarah Marr &lt;sarah.marr@dial.pipex.com&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; I don't agree that Extropians do not believe in coercion. They may not</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe in corecion by the State, but how do they propose to effect even</i><br>
<i>&gt; contractual law without any form of enforcement? </i><br>
	From the strict definition of the word, coercion, Extropians use coercion<br>
as well as anyone else.  Exploiting anothers' fear is coercion; fear of<br>
being ostracized is but one way they coerce others to "fall in line". <br>
However, it might be more accurate to say they do not believe in initiating<br>
force.  Enforcement of laws under an Extro-Society would not violate this<br>
principle since all laws would have victims.  The offender would then be<br>
the initiator of force and the victim, having a contract with an<br>
enforcement agency (private of course), would have the right to respond<br>
through this agent of theirs.  That, is how they would enforce their<br>
rights.  Writing about rights, we believe there is only one right...the<br>
right to life.   Rights to property, health, and liberty all derive from<br>
this single right.  If another can control our property (taxes, etc.) they<br>
can deprive us of life, the same for health and liberty.  To interfere with<br>
anothers' life would be the only crime.  And certainly we all recognize the<br>
right to use force, if necessary to prevent someone from killing us, no<br>
matter how slowly they are doing it.<br>
