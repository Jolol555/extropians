My original post was<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If I wanted to simulate myself, how much of me would I need to simulate?</i><br>
 Just the <br>
<i>&gt; brain patterns? or would I have to simulate everything?  Surely if I</i><br>
simulate <br>
<i>&gt; something in every possible detail, the simulation would be larger and</i><br>
slower than <br>
<i>&gt; the original.  Would my uploaded self be free from the effects of time, or</i><br>
does <br>
<i>&gt; information have to represented by something physical? (and could we</i><br>
represent it <br>
<i>&gt; by something more efficient than the original?)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All information describes something physical, therefore the physical object</i><br>
takes  &gt; less space than the description (when the description is of<br>
*everything* concerning  &gt; the physical object, and the information has to be<br>
represented by something  <br>
<i>&gt; physical).  Existing as pure information would be less efficient than</i><br>
existing as the <br>
<i>&gt; thing we create information about.</i><br>
<p>
Everyone seems to know why uploading would be an advantage (the usual<br>
uploading memories, eternal life, etc.)  But my original question was this:-<br>
<p>
To simulate physical object (which we all are) in all detail (all detail to<br>
our knowlege) would take more physical space than the original object.  For<br>
instance, say I wanted to simulate a single atom, and I wanted to simulate<br>
this on a nano-computer.  To simulate that atom, would infact take more atoms<br>
(for storage, processing, ect.) than the atom I am simulating.  The<br>
information will always require more physical space than the actual object<br>
the information is about.  Obviously a image of a house takes less space (in<br>
the form of a storage medium) than the house itself, but that is only a<br>
image, the simulate an actual house, would mean to simulate everything at a<br>
nanoscopic level.<br>
<p>
We may well be able to simulate the 'functions' of a brain, but would this be<br>
a brain?  Just because we've made rules to make it look like a brain, doesn't<br>
mean it *is* a brain.  I believe that in-order to simulate a brain you would<br>
have to simulate every detail, thus offering no advantages over the original<br>
brain (infact the new brain would be at a disadvantage).<br>
<p>
However, seeing what it's like to become a different species or downloading<br>
knowlege directly into your brain could still be just as possible in the real<br>
world.  The universe is the ultimate computer, any computer that exists<br>
inside of it is inferior.<br>
