I watched a documentary by David Suzuki on population growth recently. Paul<br>
Ehrlich was featured prominently and his famous bet with Julian Simon about<br>
commodity prices was also mentioned.<br>
<p>
The story I had heard previously was that Simon's challenge to Ehrlich was<br>
to choose any non-governmentally controlled commodities, choose any period<br>
of time greater than a year, put up a $1k and if the prices went up Simon<br>
would pay Ehrlich (and others involved in the bet) the difference, while if<br>
the prices went down they would pay him the difference. In the end<br>
Ehrlich's group chose five metals - chromium, copper, nickel, tin and<br>
tungsten - bought $200 worth of each on paper and set a ten year time<br>
period. All the prices went down and they lost $576.07.<br>
<p>
The story told in the documentary what that Ehrlich's group was basically<br>
only allowed to chose metals - no other commodities were allowed. They also<br>
didn't mention the amount of money he lost or the fact that he was able to<br>
choose the time period.<br>
<p>
They did mentioned that much more recently there has been a second<br>
challenge by Ehrlich to Simon, but that Simon had not taken up the bet.<br>
Does anyone know what's become of this second bet? And what the true story<br>
of the first bet is?<br>
<p>
The program itself was irritating is many ways. One stupidity that<br>
particularly irritated me was Ehrlich saying things like its impossible for<br>
an economy to keep growing indefinitely - implying that it would be against<br>
the laws of nature. No mention or even conception of the fact that<br>
non-physical resources could make up a major part of a growing economy.<br>
Does anyone have any figures on what part of the growth in the global<br>
economy in the last 50 years has been based on non-physical resources?<br>
<p>
best,  patrick<br>
