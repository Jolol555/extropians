Actually, the article was rather brief and to the point.  It basically said<br>
that crime was down, complaints were up from some groups, and praise was<br>
coming from others.  Specifically, it was stated that young black males<br>
were complaining while their mothers were happy.  <br>
[here begins my analysis] Such is the nature of "progressive" reform.  One<br>
group is happy but the group that coercion is practiced upon is not. <br>
Progressives have helped stall progress through regulation and they shall<br>
continue to do so in the name of the common good.  What the NYPD needs is<br>
economic analysis of law.  I see New York City resorting to martial law<br>
before that would happen.<br>
<p>
I do agree with your assessment that the media is biased.  This is why I<br>
try to look for facts when I am reading instead of mere subjective opinion.<br>
 The negative influence of the media is easily seen.  People think about a<br>
poor hurt animal featured in a special segment more than they think about<br>
dying people, or their own lack of freedom.  They think that other people<br>
should be altruistic, even though they seldom apply this to themselves<br>
(saints are fine, they are too busy doing "good works" to tell me how to<br>
live my life, its the people who think others should be saints that I worry<br>
about).  Oh well, I guess the only thing to do is to start getting my news<br>
off the net.  Can anyone recommend a good source(s) for the latest breaking<br>
news in technology, libertarianism, and economics?  <br>

<i>&gt; Although there are times when the frustration of some members of NYPD</i><br>
<i>&gt; expresses itself in unwarrented manners, the number of incidents where</i><br>
<i>&gt; this actually happens are very few and far between.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It must be remembered that there is an unfortunate tendancy on the part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the mass media to emphasize the negative disproportianately. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect on an uncritical general public is invariably received in an</i><br>
<i>&gt; uncognitive, and primarily emotional framework. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Critical thinking has not yet become as commonplace in our cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolution as we would like. If the media persist in their de-emphasis on</i><br>
<i>&gt; critical analysis and fail to provide appropriate and balanced coverage</i><br>
<i>&gt; of daily events, lacking a viable alternative to these induced vicarious</i><br>
<i>&gt; adventures, would not humankind respond accordingly in most</i><br>
<i>&gt; instances?</i><br>
