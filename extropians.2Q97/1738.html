In a previous squib, I said cryptically:=20<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the dynamic of pomo - bricolage, algorithm/trope, re-combination - will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Dominant in both scientific and humanities discourses for the next 50</i><br>
<i>&gt;years.  Sorry if that's a bit... compressed.  It's unpacked in the book.</i><br>
<p>
For anyone who's interested in a less compressed version, I'm posting a<br>
four-part summary drawn from the end of my book.  All the italics will drop<br>
out, alas, and probably some of the formatting. =20<br>
<p>
[I ask that none of this essay be quoted or reproduced beyond the extropian<br>
list, as it is still awaiting publication in an Australian magazine.]<br>
<p>
	RE-CYCLING THE ZEITGEIST<br>
=09<br>
<p>
	i<br>
<p>
What if history isn't arbitrary, isn't just a blind jostling of power and<br>
knowledge-claims?  What if human action and discourse track a kind of<br>
Zeitgeist weather cycle, periodic seasons that bias the `spirit of the<br>
times'?  During the last half-century, such questions were rarely raised<br>
but suddenly they're cropping up again - as they do, from time to time.<br>
<p>
Between the World Wars, Czech semioticians Jan Mukarovsky and Roman<br>
Jakobson noticed that the arts of distinct eras seem to be governed by<br>
different `dominants'.  Here's a simple, if obscure, example: in Czech<br>
Realist poetry of the second half of the nineteenth century, Jakobson<br>
noted, `rhythm was a dispensable device, whereas the syllabic scheme was a<br>
mandatory, inalienable component, without which verse was not verse'. =20<br>
<p>
For Jakobson, the dominant was the focusing component of an art work, the<br>
aspect that `rules, determines and transforms the remaining components'.<br>
It did not supplant or erase every other aspect of the work, of course, but<br>
it steered creativity through a particular favoured channel.  More than 60<br>
years ago, he saw that `we may seek a dominant not only in the poetic work<br>
of an individual,' or the canon of a school, `but also in the art of a<br>
given epoch, viewed as a particular whole.'  During the Renaissance, visual<br>
arts became the typical aesthetic criteria, as music did under Romanticism.<br>
 In Realist aesthetics, the dominant art was verbal.<br>
<p>
Jakobson also proposed a model for any communication process. Its circuit<br>
held six components, somewhat oversimplified and one-dimensional, but<br>
forming a neat flowchart.  A Sender exchanges a Message with the Receiver<br>
(or addressee) about some aspect of their shared World, written in a common<br>
Code and transmitted through an error-correcting, reliable Channel. =20<br>
<p>
This brutally reduced analysis can be critiqued, deconstructed and<br>
reassembled, but it stands up pretty well once you see that there's always<br>
a flow back-and-forth between writer and reader.  So it's not just a<br>
one-way imposition of Authority, from active to passive. =20<br>
<p>
Put these two Jakobson ideas together - dominant and communication circuit<br>
- and something strangely illuminating occurs.  The history of writing,<br>
according to literary critic Christine Brooke-Rose, can be seen as an<br>
itinerary `round and round the Jakobson diagram'.  If I'm right, that's<br>
true for the philosophy of science as well.<br>
<p>
Strikingly, the six communication components are themselves large-scale<br>
dominants, which have regulated the flow of ideas in the last six centuries<br>
- and perhaps much longer.  These large-scale dominants seem to orchestrate<br>
a grand waltz of ruling discourses from one generation to its successor.<br>
Call them, handily, We (addressee), I (sender), It (world), Text or Theory<br>
(message), Language (code), and Rule or Algorithm (channel).<br>
<p>
Dominant literary and artistic schools have lingered at one node or another<br>
for a decade, a generation or even longer (an Augustan Age, a Belle<br>
=C9poche), only to move on inevitably in a new leap to a predictable point o=<br>
n<br>
the diagram.  Science, too, passes from an emphasis on the inspired, to the<br>
empirical, to the theoretical, the coded, and the `cook-book' or=<br>
 algorithmic.<br>
<p>
In my new book Theory and Its Discontents, I propose a kind of discursive<br>
Theory of Everything, which plots a cyclical sequence of six phases or<br>
dominants (drawn from the Jakobson communication circuit) in the histories<br>
of both the humanities and the sciences.  It's quite a shocking thought, of<br>
course.  What could control or impose such a fixed sequence of dominants?<br>
Let me sketch a cartoon of my lengthy argument.<br>
<p>
Two obvious sites to look for the primary script of such a<br>
multi-generational round are both located in human evolutionary biology.<br>
The first is the generations of history.  Could human chronicles form<br>
chapters of a regular length, so to speak?  The second is the succession of<br>
stages of each individual's life.  Might the life-cycle sequence somehow<br>
merge and control the diverse ingredients of that narrative hubbub we call<br>
history?  Those are quite different questions from the discredited<br>
historicisms of Hegel or Marx.<br>
<p>
There's a simple way to test these possibilities - try to see if we can<br>
parse history, or life-span, into analogues of the six Jakobson nodes.  Yet<br>
if certain fairly simple biological and discursive tides might carry us in<br>
their flow, don't we slip into some inadvertently blackly comic horror of<br>
reductionism?  Such patterns, if any are discernible, will bear the same<br>
distanced relation to thick reality as Galileo's frictionless planes bear<br>
to an experimental surface of grained wood.<br>
