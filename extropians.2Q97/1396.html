<p>
Exactly. It seems to me to be the ultimate freedom. If you can work<br>
remotely, doing consulting, programming, freelance writing, etc., you<br>
can BE anywhere. And you dont have to TRAVEL. Check out Vince Cate,<br>
<a href="http://www.offshore.com.ai/vince">http://www.offshore.com.ai/vince</a>, who lives in Anguilla, a true<br>
tropical paradise, and rents a nice home for $500 a month, and pays<br>
zero income tax. (check out the view from his house at<br>
www.offshore.com.ai/vince/view.jpg , that's St. Martin/Maarten in the<br>
distance. I pay $500/mo in Cincinnati, Ohio and have a lovely view of<br>
the parking lot.)<br>
<p>
There was a story some time back on Americans who had moved to the<br>
Czech Republic and were doing telecommuting work. While not a tax<br>
haven, the guy I read about rented a 2800 square foot loft for like<br>
$50/mo US.<br>
<p>
Also, I dont see this as Tax "evasion". If you try to hide money from<br>
the US government, you're stupid. They'll catch you. True PT is REAL<br>
tax free living, you arent avoiding taxes, because you dont owe any.<br>
<p>
As a US citizen, if I spend no more than 21 days in the country in a<br>
given tax year, the first $70,000 of my income is tax free. I can also<br>
deduct any housing costs from my offshore income before I figure out<br>
my taxable income. All the while maintaining US citizenship and full<br>
rights. On a well laid out PT structure, it would be easy to live VERY<br>
well on $70,000US. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;With a proper structure of offshore companies and trusts, I can run</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;most of my life from anywhere in the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you're right when emphasizing on *structure* and not money.</i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, if you take the money you spend on an apartment and</i><br>
<i>&gt; your office (and add the none-tax bonus), you'll probably get a</i><br>
decent<br>
<i>&gt; hotel room where you can sleep and work.</i><br>
<p>
Definitely. People think that it is expensive to live in the<br>
Caribbean, because they only think of the posh resorts. Vince lives in<br>
paradise for $500/mo. Cable &amp; Wireless does provide Internet<br>
connectivity off the Island, and there has been modern digital<br>
switched phone service to the whole island for quite some time.<br>
<p>
The structure is the key. Both for anonymity and tax abatement. The<br>
structure I envision involves a network of companies in several places<br>
about the world. Every country has it's inherent benefits. Banking is<br>
good in Belize, Income tax is gone in Anguilla, Cayman, and the like.<br>
There's a portion of Switzerland, 50 square miles or so, that is<br>
legally owned by Italy. It's fairly easy, albeit a bit pricey, to set<br>
up companies there under Italian law with all rights of Swiss<br>
companies, but without the strict foreign ownership laws and control<br>
reporting. You also gain free entry and travel to switzerland,<br>
lichtenstein, and Italy.<br>
<p>
I've been pondering this very subject VERY hard for the past several<br>
weeks. At the risk of using a cliche, I've come to realize that Wealth<br>
doesnt equal money. You only need enough to support the lifestyle you<br>
want. If you do what you want, live where you want, and feel 'Free',<br>
then you are wealthy. Dont get me wrong, I'd love to be obscenely<br>
rich. But I think I could live as a PT for actually alot less than I<br>
make now. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Which brings me to an aside. Why do we need, as Extropians who</i><br>
embrace<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Intelligent Technology, a physical presence anywhere today?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The family still is and will continue to be important. But still,</i><br>
<i>&gt; its not an obstacle for the PT. Event if you travel a lot, you'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably want to return "home" once in a while.</i><br>
<p>
To quote Bill Shakespeare, "Aye, there's the rub." I have a wife and a<br>
2 year old son. My wife doesnt want to move away from her family. If I<br>
were a single man, I could detach fairly easy.<br>
