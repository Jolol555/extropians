Hmm, it has just occurred to me that there might be a Hayekian<br>
argument here?  Maybe the killjoys have a point in that our present<br>
emotional/cognitive setup is functional in ways we don't yet understand,<br>
and perhaps there is some sort of balance there that, if disturbed,<br>
would render it dysfunctional in some way we can't foresee?<br>
