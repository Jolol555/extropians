Chris Thompson:<br>
<i>&gt;This is a subject I've been wanting to bring up here for some time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The concept of PT or Perpetual Traveler is very Extropian to me. In</i><br>
<i>&gt;essence, you are never in one country long enough to be under it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;jurisdiction. This doesnt mean skulking from country to country every</i><br>
<i>&gt;week, but essentially it involves a way to structure your life so that</i><br>
<i>&gt;you have complete freedom to do what you please with your money.</i><br>
<p>
What strikes me, from my browsing on the PT subject, is that it<br>
is so easy. You don't even need a starting capital, only you're able<br>
to be more or less flexible with where and how you get your income.<br>
Opening an offshore bank account doesn't seem more difficult than<br>
doing it at your local bank. (It's sad that, at least here in Sweden,<br>
tax-crime is regarded as one of the most serious crime you can<br>
commit, in fact much worse that murder).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;With a proper structure of offshore companies and trusts, I can run</i><br>
<i>&gt;most of my life from anywhere in the world.</i><br>
<p>
I think you're right when emphasizing on *structure* and not money.<br>
For example, if you take the money you spend on an apartment and<br>
your office (and add the none-tax bonus), you'll probably get a decent<br>
hotel room where you can sleep and work.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Which brings me to an aside. Why do we need, as Extropians who embrace</i><br>
<i>&gt;Intelligent Technology, a physical presence anywhere today?</i><br>
<p>
The family still is and will continue to be important. But still,<br>
its not an obstacle for the PT. Event if you travel a lot, you'll<br>
probably want to return "home" once in a while.<br>
