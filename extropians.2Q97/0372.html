<i>&gt;Well... I belive in NOTHING. I have come to realise that everything</i><br>
<i>&gt;is just a game/filter/theory/map/menu etc. etc.</i><br>
[...]<br>
<i>&gt;For operation of my bio-computer in the 'real' world I have to choose a</i><br>
<i>&gt;game/ritual/theory (which deep down I know to be a lie).</i><br>
<p>
I don't know, is a game or filter the same thing as a lie?<br>
Aren't they really just choices, like choosing which city to live in?<br>
I mean, do you believe there is a more real reality behind these things<br>
that they're covering up?  Or is this choice of games just the way it is?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;[...]I refuse to stick to any one emic reality for any length of</i><br>
<i>&gt;time. This is [...] bad as progress is slowed almost to a stop.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was wondering if any other extropians had similar difficulties[...]</i><br>
<p>
I had two separate depressed years where it seemed existence was<br>
baseless and there was no reason to go on.  Also a pretty long period<br>
where I felt I just didn't *want* anything.  The thing that helped me<br>
was realizing that I sure didn't *want* to feel depressed, I didn't<br>
*want* life to be empty, etc.<br>
<p>
For instance, you talk about lack of progress as a problem.  maybe you want<br>
"progress."  Or, maybe not, when you look at it.  But if that sounds<br>
bad, it means that there is some "good" way you wish things were.  Also<br>
you talk about tolerance as a good thing.  Or maybe you're overdoing<br>
tolerance!<br>
<p>
Anyway it worked for me.  At least started me moving.<br>
