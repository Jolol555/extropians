<i>&gt;The Libertarian and Green and movements are beginning to coalesce</i><br>
<i>&gt;(thanks to an old economic philosophy that seems new bringing the two</i><br>
<i>&gt;into greater discussion</i><br>
<p>
I think there is a lot of room for greater use of libertarian thought in<br>
Green philosophy. Simple economic arguments are uncomfortable to many<br>
Greens. It clear that here in Australia there is a massive subsidy to the<br>
forest industry by the government. The government not only builds roads in<br>
the forest for the logging industry, but does all the clean up and planting<br>
of new trees after logging has finished. This tax subsidy allows woodchips<br>
very cheaply at $70 a tonne which is particular ironic as surveys<br>
repeatedly show that around 80% of Australians don't want forests logged in<br>
the first place. However trying to get Green groups to push a rational<br>
economic line is particularly difficult. There is a strong almost religious<br>
fervor against all economic arguments. Money to many in the movement is<br>
seen as a tool of the devil.<br>
<p>
I would very much appreciate getting a better understanding of how<br>
libertarian thought can be meshed with the idea of public property.<br>
Wilderness areas to the Greens are common property to all and must be<br>
managed as such by a government body and this I think (from my shallow<br>
reading of libertarian philosophy) would be a major sticking point between<br>
better integration of the two groups.<br>
<p>
best, patrick<br>
