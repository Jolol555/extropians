I think you left out my favorite now shock area: biotechnology. It is<br>
already making a lot of headway, and while people in general are<br>
horrified by distractions like Dolly and genetically engineered soya<br>
the field rushes on in Mach 3. Hugo is producing discoveries like a<br>
fleet of Voyager probes (ever noticed how pre-Voyager pictures of the<br>
solar system now look quaintly antique?), people are making cells do<br>
fascinating tricks (grow in patterns, produce tissues and substances<br>
we want etc) and we are getting better and better at understanding<br>
the "logic" of life. Guess where I would bet nanotech and other &gt;H<br>
goodies will appear? Even if they doesn't it is an useful field, and<br>
probably worth looking into, although so far the huge profits<br>
predicted has not panned out. It reminds me of the debate books about<br>
the information society I read as a child in the 70's; many of them<br>
got a lot of things *right*, but since not much happened in the 80's<br>
people forgot about it until it suddenly knocked down their doors. <br>
Biotechnology may do the same.<br>

<i>&gt; 1) The &gt;Web, a near-future noosphere matrix which leads</i><br>

<i>&gt;    by technologies unimaginable to us-current. This is</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the most conservative route, since involving merely</i><br>

<i>&gt;    agentry, operated by radical GUIs (HMDs, speech and</i><br>
<i>&gt;    optical input, Brain-Actuated Control (BAC) and trivial</i><br>
<i>&gt;    neuro emplants for virtual motorics).</i><br>
<p>
It is also a quite hot area to invest in. My guess is to look for<br>
tools for *knowledge management*, we are getting better at<br>
information management but we need more knowledge tools. <br>

Ever thought about taking up a career in poetry? :-)<br>

<i>&gt; 3) Space-located (macroscopic) autoreplicators (initially</i><br>
<i>&gt;    designed and deployed for extraterrestrial industry</i><br>
<i>&gt;    purposes) subjected to darwinian fitness pressure will</i><br>

<i>&gt;    luminance/hard vacuum being their natural habitat, letting</i><br>
<i>&gt;    their meek engineered origins far behind (even forgetting us,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    though future machines should be able of being sentimental).</i><br>
<p>
Not as imminent IMHo as your 1) and 2) (or my biotech), since it<br>
supposes a working space industry. Right now the sky is looking<br>
brighter, but  I doubt we will see a space boom anytime soon. Too<br>
bad, I want to be off this rock ASAP.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Apart from having a good time, and a faint chance of actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; contributing to the global transhumanist memefection conspiracy</i><br>
<i>&gt; (tee-hee), my strictly personal life heuristic is thus to</i><br>
<i>&gt; maneuvre oneself into a position of surviving the transition</i><br>
<i>&gt; imminent (it'd better), possibly even profiting by it. Somehow I</i><br>
<i>&gt; surmise am not alone in this ;)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, this is important. It is safer to be useful and productive than<br>
merely supporting. And learning to become very flexible is always a<br>
good way to improve survival.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; We are in a curious position today: the inexpensive computing</i><br>
<i>&gt; power currently available to us has far outstripped our</i><br>
<i>&gt; capability to do useful things with them. Quite obviously we</i><br>
<i>&gt; haven't been able to keep up with the way our tools have grown.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Our tools are not sufficiently autonomous and smart yet to aid</i><br>
<i>&gt; us in their use. The year this changes will make us stumble a</i><br>
<i>&gt; yet another major step up to the Singularity.</i><br>
<p>
Very true. In some sense HCI is one of the most important fields for<br>
our future evolution. Judging from its current state (metaphors vs.<br>
direct manipulation, 2D and 3D GUIs) we need some more geniuses here<br>
(hmm, I wonder if there is some signal substance that can be used to<br>
attract geniuses to a field? Spread it, and they come flying). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; since the age histogram of industrialized countries is getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; progressively skewed towards higher age.</i><br>
<p>
The baby boomers will soon be demanding life extension.<br>
