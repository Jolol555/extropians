If people like us dominated a rich and powerful future civilization,<br>
what a glorious place it might be.  They would value the things we<br>
value, and so we stand a good chance of approving of their choices<br>
regarding space exploration, scientific advance, body modifications,<br>
individual freedoms, ecological preservation, spiritual insight, and<br>
industrial advance.<br>
<p>
But will our future descendants want what we want?  Or will<br>
evolutionary pressures change the distribution of values in our<br>
descendants?<br>
<p>
The following two papers offer useful insights into the evolution of<br>
values.  <br>
<p>
  Ingemar Hansson, Charles Stuart, "Malthusian Selection of Preferences",<br>
  American Economic Review, June 1990, V.80 No. 3. pp.529-544.<br>
<p>
  Lawrence Blume, David Easley, "Evolution and Market Behavior",<br>
  Journal of Economic Theory, 1992, V.58, pp.9-40.<br>
<p>
The Blume &amp; Easley paper analyzes the investment values selected for<br>
by asexual reproduction.  It finds that such evolution selects for<br>
investors with logarithmic (and hence risk-averse) utility of wealth,<br>
minimal time-discount (i.e. maximal patience), and Bayesian beliefs<br>
with the smallest relative entropy to the truth.<br>
<p>
The Hansson &amp; Stuart paper tries to infer the gender and age specific<br>
time discount values that were an equilibrium in our tribal past.<br>
They note that on average sexual reproduction in a stable population<br>
should prefer a discount rate of a factor of 2 per generation (which<br>
fits with historic interest rates), but find that for tribal humans it<br>
varies with age and gender.  Young males, for example, discount the<br>
future heavily, in contrast to children and men over 35.<br>
<p>
I don't have a cite, but I think there are also good reasons to think<br>
that young males should be risk-takers rather than risk-averse.  On<br>
average though one would expect only slight risk-aversion from sexual<br>
reproduction, except for small genetic populations.<br>
<p>
I also have a theory that young males should be more optimistic than<br>
Bayesians; the better they think of their prospects the more likely<br>
they are to fool young women into thinking highly of their prospects.<br>
<p>
As we become better at exchanging information in ways other than via<br>
sexual reproduction, it seems the longer time-horizon of asexual<br>
reproduction should win out.  This suggests a future of very patient<br>
risk-averse asexual Bayesians, in contrast to the impatient optimistic<br>
risk-taking young males who dominate science fiction.<br>
