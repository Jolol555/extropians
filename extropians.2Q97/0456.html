	We have some questions which we would love to get some feedback on if<br>
there is anyone on the list who is familiar with the problem.<br>
	The overall question is how a protein with a certain sequence of amino<br>
acids takes the form of a unique three dimensional structure in water/body.<br>
 The next level of question to this, what are(is) the most dominating<br>
forces in the formation of the unique structure.  In the 60's an oil drop<br>
in water was suggested and said as the oil in water collapses to a globule<br>
so does a stretched sequence of protein collapses into a globular-like<br>
structure.  This force was/is called hydrophobicity.  Later on it was found<br>
that water around oil/apolar groups in proteins forms very organized<br>
structures known as clathartes/ice-like structures etc.  These "ice-like"<br>
structures have small entropy (high structure)  Until recently the<br>
understanding was up to this point: formation of highly organized<br>
structures around apolar groups.  Recently it has been found that the low<br>
entropy phenomena is not restricted to apolar groups but is found for water<br>
around polar groups as well.  So what do we do?  What is so unique about<br>
water around polar groups (oily matter)?  It has been found it the past few<br>
years that the heat capacity (tendency to absorb heat) around apolar groups<br>
increases while the heat capacity of water around polar groups decreases. <br>
Can this last observation be reproduced by computer simulations?  Can this<br>
be explained by a reasonable theory?<br>
	If it is understood how water behaves around apolar groups and polar<br>
groups in proteins, it will be easy to understand and predict the formation<br>
of a unique 3-dimensional structure from a sequence of protein.  Hence the<br>
design of a drug from a computer for a diseased protein.<br>
	We would appreciate any discussion of this problem.<br>
