The response is quite inappropriate.<br>
<p>
Max's first listed publication was published by the LA, when I was an <br>
LA Executive Committee member.<br>
<p>
I took political advice on publishing it from the President of the Adam <br>
Smith Institute.<br>
<p>
He said 'publish it.'  <br>
<p>
I said 'publish it.' <br>
<p>
Chris R. Tame said 'Publish it.'<br>
<p>
And so Maz's first essay was was published.<br>
<p>
<p>
That is, we took a chance on publishing Max.<br>
<p>
<p>
The Daily Express paid out four-figure damages to Chris Tame and Madsen <br>
Pirie when John Selwyn Gummer put them up to trying to smear us with it.<br>
<p>
Neither Chris Tame nor I are 'paedophiles.'<br>
<p>
We do -- as intellectuals and libertarians, subscribe to the principle of <br>
open discussion of difficult problem-situations.<br>
<p>
<p>
Chris has a superbly attractive wife. &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
[FX: "Thou shalt not covet..." ]  &gt;:-}  <br>
<p>
I rather fancy Sandahl Bergman, Linda Hamilton and Olivia Newton-John.<br>
<p>
<p>
Thank you so much for your interest and concern ...<br>
