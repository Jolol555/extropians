<i>&gt; I am curious how important money is to people on this list.</i><br>
<p>
That's not a meaningful question.  Money is simply a means of<br>
measuring and facilitating trade among people in order to get<br>
the actual things they value.  "How important is money" is them<br>
like asking "How important is importance?" or "How valubale is<br>
value?"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would you take a job that had little effect on other extropian </i><br>
<i>&gt; type goals but made you millions in a few years?</i><br>
<p>
If it makes me millions, then it /will/ have an effect on<br>
extropian goals; namely, mine.  It will pay for my cryonic<br>
suspension and that of any willing family.  It will pay for my<br>
web bandwidth to publish extropian ideas.  It will pay for any<br>
modifications to my body, by house, my car, may computers, or<br>
other things that assist my goals.  That's what it's for.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can more be accomplished by funding research (or politics) than</i><br>
<i>&gt; by direct involvement?</i><br>
<p>
Funding /is/ involvement.  Money makes it easier for those<br>
people with the most skills at, say, cryonics, to be hired by<br>
those whose talents can be more productive elsewhere.  Money<br>
and trade make the system more efficient, by making things like<br>
human talent and vision more fungible.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What sort of tradeoffs do you see between time spent making money</i><br>
<i>&gt; and time spent doing other things?  How much money is plenty?</i><br>
<p>
If you are making money, you are by definition doing what you<br>
can to achieve whatever your goals are.  There is no such thing<br>
as "enough" or "plenty"; they are menaingless abstractions.<br>
