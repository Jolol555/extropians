<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I can't talk for Extropians, but I can talk for myself. And I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;that economy and free markets is what makes those people poor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Some facts are so simple and obvious that somehow they get</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; overlooked.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Free markets and economies don't make poor children.  Parents do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh man, you did it. You made me laugh, which rarely occurs on this list.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is one of the funniest Libertarian explanations for inequality I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; ever read.</i><br>
<p>
And rather obvious as well. How children turn out is entirely based on<br>
the choices their parents made, even before they were born. I'm 29 with<br>
no kids, because I choose to not reproduce until I am in my own opinion<br>
able to provide a responsible environment for my kids. This is not just<br>
me either. My older brother, currently much farther along the same<br>
track, is still expecting to wait at least another 5 years before having<br>
kids. The only people I know who have had kids and are my age are the<br>
idiots who did not go on to college. Most of them are bankrupt and<br>
divorced by now at least once.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But to become serious again: Education _is_ a real problem. Not only</i><br>
<i>&gt; education of the poor, but also education of those who are able to buy</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole universities. Money means power, and in a world where some people</i><br>
<i>&gt; are much richer than others, you will always have explicit power</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures.</i><br>
<p>
Duh, and there will alwasy be black holes and quasars too. Communist<br>
systems also had their moguls, you just never heard about them because<br>
their wealth was a state secret, and if you complained it was off to the<br>
cotton mines for you.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Decisions of today are made by this power elite. This ain't the big bad</i><br>
<i>&gt; government guys, it's those economic rulers, investment banks especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Brown Brothers Harriman, Morgan Investment Trust). They own all the</i><br>
<i>&gt; larger companies and, as if this wouldn't be enough, also manage them</i><br>
<i>&gt; with their people sitting in the board of directors.</i><br>
<p>
WHile I personally see no merit in large inheritances, those that get to<br>
such positions due to their own skill and drive to me deserve to be<br>
where they are and have demonstrated ability to match the responsibility<br>
they assume.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; They WANT government. Goverment is an easy way to get money (taxes) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; to invest it the way they want. Government therefore doesn't only (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; does hardly) do "clever" investments. Pushing weapons industry, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; example, always helps big companies to grow bigger and to crush smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies, for it doesn't raise the life standard.</i><br>
<p>
HAH, now you did it. Its the old imperialist gun makers routine again.<br>
Sorry you could not be more wrong. I can tell you for a fact that the<br>
absolute very worst thing for any arms company's long term stability is<br>
war and arms buildups. If you look at all of the arms companies<br>
operating over the last 200 years, you will find that at a bare minimum,<br>
90% of them go bankrupt within 2 years of the end of a major war or arms<br>
buildup. WHy? because in war and during buildups, governments give them<br>
huge orders beyond their capacity to meet, so they expand furiously to<br>
meet the artificial demand, and often are under strict quotas of<br>
production which they cannot vary from, even when any idiot can see that<br>
a war is almost over and it would be wise to start shifting resources<br>
back to consumer production. Once the war or buildup ends, government<br>
contracts are cancelled, leaving huge amounts of capacity idle for a<br>
bare minimum of 6 months to 5 years, which is the kicker that breaks<br>
companies backs. <br>
<p>
People still are wondering why Russia is still in the pits. Its obvious,<br>
they still havent fully converted from a wartime production footing.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Remove government and you get a dictatorship of banks / monopolies. Much</i><br>
<i>&gt; worse than gov't could ever be. Freedom? You'll be so free, you'll want</i><br>
<i>&gt; to buy a whole load of guns in order to defend yourself from street</i><br>
<i>&gt; thugs. Equality? Raising life standard? Nope. But nobody who defends</i><br>
<i>&gt; markets claims that -- that's natural selection. Eat or be eaten. Live</i><br>
<i>&gt; and let die.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Conclusion: Make those powerful guys cleverer, and they'll recognize</i><br>
<i>&gt; that making the everone else cleverer, too, will be to their own benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the long term. That's all you need. No communism (any communist</i><br>
<i>&gt; movement is crushed in its roots, whether by media propaganda or by</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons power), no free markets and no dictatorships (whereas these two</i><br>
<i>&gt; are actually the same).</i><br>
<p>
THis lesson has already been learned by our most successful<br>
billionaire/mogul/tycoon/capitalist running dog oppressor, Bill Gates,<br>
as well as scores of other technology industrialists. You've still got<br>
problems over there because you've got ex-communist party bosses running<br>
around playing 19th century robber baron. You should have strung them up<br>
when you had the chance.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I advocate efforts to help the poor. They'll never be enough to save the</i><br>
<i>&gt; poor children, though. And anyone who puts this phrase in quotation</i><br>
<i>&gt; marks should take a look. 12.5 million each year, have fun on your</i><br>
<i>&gt; vacation. Poor, poor children -- they're just too stupid, or their</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents are, or government is evil, or aliens have infiltrated them, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; they've deserved it, or ...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, I hope this isn't classified as "rant" again. I hope some of you</i><br>
<i>&gt; think about what I say, or it is a waste of time. I don't want to insult</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone, I'm a peaceful guy. Maybe I just want the same thing you do:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Make this world a better place.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
That is what most of us are after, but we know from experience that much<br>
more is done constructively by individuals on a volunteer basis than any<br>
centrally planned solution. It is a fact that Americans are the very<br>
most charitable givers in the world, at the very same time that we are<br>
considered by most to be the most capitalist.<br>
