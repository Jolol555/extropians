Something exists in nothing in order for that nothing to observed as nothing,<br>
or is it something!?  Okay, you where right I can't answer that question.  It<br>
wouldn't help us if we did know.  To individuals perception is everything,<br>
that's what we are.  To the universe perception is nothing.<br>

<p>
Think about it, logic *is* cause and effect.  There is nothing that exists<br>
that has effect without cause. <br>
               <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;I have no idea why you would consider the soul and consciousness</i><br>
as <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;the same thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The soul as I understand it is something important, the only important</i><br>
thing <br>
<i>&gt;  about me, the only important thing in the universe, is consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
True, without something to percieve the universe the universe may aswell not<br>
exist.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          &gt;Information is 'about' physical things.  It must be representing</i><br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;something physical and it must be represented by something</i><br>
physical.<br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  If I am sad, frightened, angry and jealous then I am feeling 4 emotions.</i><br>
   <br>
<i>&gt;  Are Emotions something physical?</i><br>
<p>
These are 4 emotions that are attached to something physical.  All these<br>
emotions are physical reactions, to physical things.  They have been evolved<br>
to help you react (although in modern society the triggers for these emotions<br>
have become more complex).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          &gt;How are you defining the soul exactly ?  </i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt;  The essential thing that makes me be me. </i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;If the soul is like information, what is the information on ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Information on the position and velocity of atoms.</i><br>
<p>
So the essential thing that makes you be you (and me be me) is the position<br>
and velocity of your atoms.  Why should this be information? or is<br>
consciousness the processing of the information, and the soul the infomation<br>
it processes?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;          &gt;An abstraction would only seem the same, on a physical level it</i><br>
    <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;would not be identical and nor would it react the same.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I'm not sure what you mean by "an abstraction" but I agree, if something </i><br>
<i>&gt; does not react the same then it is not the same, I was supposing it did.</i><br>
<p>
By 'an abstraction' I mean a computer simulating of a brain (or functions of<br>
a brain).  If the computer reacts the same as a brain, it is a brain.  <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;&gt;It seems to me that the mind is what the brain does, if two</i><br>
brains <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;&gt;are doing the same thing then there is only one mind.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;Only if they occupy the exact same space, otherwise they are</i><br>
seperate.          <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;All of the differences between seperate objects are due to</i><br>
position <br>
<i>&gt;          &gt;and movement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           </i><br>
<i>&gt;  By itself a brain can not detect it's position, a brain can't detect</i><br>
anything, <br>
<i>&gt;  only the position of the brain's sense organs is important. It's not just </i><br>
<i>&gt;  space, a brain can't detect time either, I could stop your brain for a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  billion years and then restart it and you would never know unless your </i><br>
<i>&gt; senses told you.</i><br>
<p>
True, and two similar brains without senses would act the same.  However,<br>
even if the brain cannot detect it's position, it's position can effect it<br>
(amount of oxygen, radiation, etc.)  But what would the brain care!?<br>
<p>
Also:  If we could build conscious software to run on other systems<br>
(conscious or otherwise) could it be that other consciouses exist within<br>
ourselves already.  Or is it a one per system thing (which would rule<br>
uploading everyone to one super-computer out)<br>
