I wrote Friday that I thought it would be a bad idea to invest in a startup<br>
doing R&amp;D towards Drexlerian nanotech.  At the time I was being completely<br>
hypothetical.  However today I was browsing <a href="http://www.foresight.org">http://www.foresight.org</a>, and<br>
I learned that exactly such a company started up last month!<br>
<p>
Zyvex, at <a href="http://www.zyvex.com/">http://www.zyvex.com/</a>, is a Texas company whose mission is to<br>
develop the first assembler.  They don't have a very clear timeline to when<br>
they will achieve it, although I saw "5+ years" mentioned.<br>
<p>
They aren't asking for funding on the page, but if anyone wants to ignore<br>
my advice I'm sure you could contact the company and find out if there would<br>
be any opportunities to participate in future funding rounds.<br>
