     As an independent thinking extopian, I would like to ask everyone of<br>
their opinion on the following idea.  Since we do not believe in coercion,<br>
and we don't believe in using force against others (except in self defense),<br>
then it would seem to me that there would be no "crime" committed by being<br>
nude in public.<br>
     In an Extropian type, anarcho-capitalistic society, clothing would<br>
definately be optional.  I only raise this issue because so very many people<br>
think it is "evil" to be nude.  I think mandating that all people wear<br>
clothes is somewhat like mandating that everyone have car insurance.  It's<br>
great for the clothing industry, and to foster control over people, but it's<br>
seems to me that "mandatory clothing in public" is as rediculous of a concept<br>
as any of which I can think.<br>
     I know many of you may say that it is a trivial matter, but I think it's<br>
deeper than that.  It's about freedom.  Please respond with comments,<br>
whatever your opinons are.  Thanks.       Shawn Johnson<br>
