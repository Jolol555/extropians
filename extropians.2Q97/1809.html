I agree with you. But one has to play on the safe side, especially<br>
when dealing with subjects which have a huge potential for flakiness<br>
(uploading, nanotechnology, transcending the human condition, the<br>
singularity, life extension etc). There is mountains of imagined,<br>
supposed and ethereal stuff out there, but very little practically<br>
useful stuff in the areas this list deals with. So we need to keep an<br>
eye on what can and cannot be done, and avoid being swept away by our<br>
hopes. <br>
<p>
Of course, you are right that many here are a bit sensitive about<br>
certain "spiritual" issues (even my blood pressure rises<br>
involuntarily when I encounter what I perceive as "new age fluff"),<br>
something which suggests the presence of sacred cows (and we all know<br>
what to do with them! :-). Still, I think we all have to learn to<br>
deal with each other and try to make something very practical out of<br>
our grand visions. <br>
