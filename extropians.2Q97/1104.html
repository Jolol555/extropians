<i>&gt;&gt;Wouldn't it be simpler to say that these</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;studies show that there is a health advantage gained by having a low</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;*quantity* of fat in your diet: you can achieve this either by having a low</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;proportion of fat in a high calorie diet, or a large (or low) amount of fat</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;in a low-calorie diet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No; the studies show there is an advantage to having a low quantity of</i><br>
<i>&gt;*calories* in your diet (above starvation, of course).  High-fat, low-fat, no</i><br>
<i>&gt;big deal, as long as the calories are low.</i><br>
<p>
I think we are talking at cross-purposes. My point was that there appear to<br>
be two factors at work: amount of fat and amount of calories appear to be<br>
independent risk factors. That is:<br>
<p>
A low-fat, low-calorie diet is better than,<br>
A low-fat, high-calorie diet is better than<br>
A  high-fat, high-calorie diet.<br>
<p>
I don't really see how you can have a diet high in fat (in terms of actual<br>
**amounts** of fat eaten) if you are on a low-calorie diet.<br>
<p>
Large amounts of fat does all sorts of damage to the cardiovasular system<br>
as well as increasing the risk of cancer. Lowering the amount of fat<br>
reduces the amount of damage you can do. On the other hand lower calories<br>
appears to be related to the slowing the aging process itself. I am not<br>
sure whether this slowing only occurs when one passes a certain threshold<br>
of calorie intake or whether at all stages a lower calorie intake implies<br>
slower aging.<br>
<p>
You seem to be arguing that there is no point going on a low-fat diet<br>
unless you go on a low-calorie diet which I think is not only false, but<br>
dangerous advice to many people since most aren't going to go on a calorie<br>
restricted diet, but certainly could improve their health by better diet.<br>
<p>
Please post the references to the studies you are citing.<br>
<p>
best,  patrick<br>
