<i>&gt;your ego is your idea of yourself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;and while you want to leave your idea of yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt;subject to doubt and revision,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you still need to be as true to yourself--your actual self--</i><br>
<i>&gt;as you know how to be.</i><br>
<i>&gt;and your ego is your own judgement--so far--about that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;so the idea is not to fight or oppose or ignore or belittle the ego,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but to realize that it is an idea, a judgement, and that it's necessary.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;you don't want to be ego-centric--enslaved to one of your own ideas,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but you do want to be self-centered--speaking and acting from your</i><br>
<i>&gt;own center as best you know how--and that know-how is your ego.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is possible to be more true to yourself than you *know* how to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be, just because it's possible to have resources or luck that you</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't know you had.  in fact it's possible to know *that*, to count</i><br>
<i>&gt;on it, make provision for it, choose it as a way of life--that is, to</i><br>
<i>&gt;incorporate knowlege of your ego's incompleteness into your ego.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;but maybe what some people mean by ego is your self-image's tendency</i><br>
<i>&gt;to distort to serve *itself*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;I follow Fritz Perls' line in most things, and he noted that your "self" is</i><br>
<i>&gt;just yourself.  You are your body, there is no "self" inside you.  But the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ego, in Perls' terms, is the aspect of you that is trying to determine</i><br>
<i>&gt;what's you and what's not-you.  Perls thought that most neuroses were</i><br>
<i>&gt;problems of incorrect identification, treating self as nonself or vice-</i><br>
<i>&gt;versa.  And he seemed both fascinated by "satori" (awakening) experiences,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and scornful of the idea of "oneness with everything."  I still worship the</i><br>
<i>&gt;guy but I think he was difficult sometimes.  I mean difficult to worship.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe he was saying what I was saying (or vice-versa): that are you and</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to be you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I hope I made clear the three levels I was talking about above:</i><br>
<i>&gt;actual self, idea/image of self, and the tendency of the idea to distort</i><br>
<i>&gt;so as to become entrenched.  Only the last one of the three is something to</i><br>
<i>&gt;work against.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Goeff notes:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Some religions claim that this [letting go of ego] is letting in "god".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Another way to look at it is to define "God" as all the stuff one's</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas and habits of perception don't account for.  So to let go [of</i><br>
<i>&gt;preconceptions] is to "let [in] God."  I think a lot of what religions say</i><br>
<i>&gt;is useful--even vital--when you interpret it in that way.  Ideas and</i><br>
<i>&gt;habits have a tendency to close in on themselves tighter and tighter, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's important to have a compass that keeps pointing you in the opposite</i><br>
<i>&gt;direction.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Great post Steve!  Only looking at it cursorily, but I think I<br>
understand and agree with just about everything you've said here.<br>
