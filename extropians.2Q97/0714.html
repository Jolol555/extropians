Okay, this time I'm replying to the list on purpose rather than by<br>
accident.  Kennita says:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;...  You're supposed to screw up your eyes, look off into space for</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a bit, and then say, "I *get* it!  I get *it!*..." etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If it's an IQ test, I flunk.  I've been over it and over it, and I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;get it.</i><br>
<p>
Kennita, you're not the only one.  Sorry, the thing about "getting it"<br>
was a joke.  The piece itself was meant as, well, what it was: a<br>
series of semi-related things that look like broken beginnings of jokes or<br>
koans or dreams or short stories... all pasted together in a fast sequence<br>
so it looks like it's a poem or song lyric, or trying to go somewhere.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A couple of times I thought maybe I did, but when I checked, what</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was thinking didn't make sense.</i><br>
<p>
Oh!  In that case, you *did* get it!<br>
<p>
I've just finnished a couple books by Thomas Moore: _Care of the Soul_ and<br>
_The Re-Enchantment of Everyday Life_.  One of the things he stresses<br>
repeatedly is that good art, like myths and dream imagery, doesn't<br>
admit to any single interpretation.  Instead it gives your mind something<br>
to get interested in, wonder about, vamp on, get lost in, etc.  "Tell me<br>
if you've heard this one" was my first piece of, er, improvised writing<br>
since reading Moore.  The things in "Tell me" that look almost sensible I<br>
didn't think about until after I'd written them.<br>
<p>
I think Franklin VanArdoy gets a B.  Extra points for saying it's a<br>
schizophrenia test, but then points off for saying "You don't want to<br>
pass it."  How mundane!  What is this world coming to!?<br>
<p>
Hal Dunn gets a B, too, for saying it's either nonsense or code.  True,<br>
but *then* what?  The correct response to nonsense would have been to<br>
decode it.<br>
<p>
Shaun Russell gives *me* a B, I think (honored if so), by saying "...it has<br>
you thinking, doesn't it?"<br>
<p>
Thanks, all.<br>
<p>
