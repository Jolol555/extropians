Hi!<br>
<p>
I would like to know your opinion about why are we allowed to age? Why,<br>
after millions of years of evolution, we still age?<br>
<p>
Following the darwinist concept of evolution, surely a trait that would<br>
allow one individual to live longer than the others would be favoured.<br>
Indiduals with these trait would produce more offspring and therefore<br>
the trait would soon be present in the general population. This,<br>
however, doesn't happen with humans neither (as far as I know) other<br>
mammals. If, there are species capable of such intellectual skills (such<br>
as us) and many other species with amazing skills, why hasn't a<br>
non-aging process evolved in many more species that it did?<br>
<p>
I'm pratically new to this mailing list so I hope I get some answers.<br>
<p>
             Hasta la vista...<br>
<p>
