IMHO it was not a great case, but a funny and interesting case. I<br>
recommend the book, but it does not provide that much evidence for<br>
the "universal theory"; it mainly uses the same kind of convincing<br>
handwaving (if more cyberdelic) as is used to support other<br>
personality models (Ericsson, Freud, Jung and other personality<br>
psychologists). It is easy to tie together everything, the hard part<br>
is showing that the ties actually mean something. <br>
<p>
I have found support of many of his observations both in my own<br>
experience and in established psychological results; "what the<br>
thinker thinks the prover proves" is widely recognized in cognitive<br>
science, the anal character of territorialism is quite noticeable<br>
(although this could be a WTTTTPP effect) and I have found plenty of<br>
evidence for the snafu-principle of hierarchical organisations. I'm<br>
somewhat more sceptical of the "higher circuits"; I partially buy the<br>
concept of the fifth which I have experienced myself, but the others<br>
need better delineations and support (and one should remember that<br>
this system is just one possible map of the human mind).<br>

The difference is that the benefits are less well defined. <br>
