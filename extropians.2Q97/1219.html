<i>&gt; From: James Rogers &lt;jamesr@best.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Subject: Extropian Investment Club?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would like know if anyone would be interested in starting an investment club.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Investment is essential for financial security and is accessible </i><br>
<i>&gt;even to people of meager financial means. </i><br>
<p>
Hello. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Since, many extropians are planning on living indefinitely, </i><br>
<i>&gt; it would be prudent to start planning your very long-term finances now.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Intelligent investments usually result in being independently wealthy </i><br>
<i>&gt; when applied for ~40 years, even if the investments appear small.</i><br>
<p>
 20% compounded annually for ETERNITY sounds good to me!<br>
How about you?<br>
If we play smart (the only way to play) we can get 2000% gains.<br>
It may take solid dedication and determination, <br>
but it has been done before and will be done again.<br>
Who better to do it?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Additionally, I would be willing to operate a website and other Internet</i><br>
<i>&gt; services dedicated to this.  I am half-owner of a couple modest servers and</i><br>
<i>&gt; some redundant T-1 connections, so it would cost me nothing other than my time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If anyone is interested in becoming involved in something like this, please</i><br>
<i>&gt; let me know.</i><br>
<p>
 I would, at least, like to be kept informed of how this meme evolves.<br>
I've been wanting to become a broker, <br>
but I've yet to fit the pieces of this puzzle together.<br>
I want to see this idea get off the ground.<br>
Being rich is very extropian.<br>
