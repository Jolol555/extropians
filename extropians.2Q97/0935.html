It's a cool concept, but nature has tried it, and the separation is not that<br>
good.  All the planets and most large asteroids have been entirely molten at<br>
some time in their past, and they have seperated into only three chemically<br>
distinct units, thanks to the miscibility of elements:<br>
<p>
--Iron, nickel, carbon, and heavy metals.  Geologists call this "core" and<br>
steelworkers call it "molten steel".<br>
<p>
--Silicates rich in aluminum and magnesium.  Geologists call this "mantle<br>
and crust" and steelworkers call it "slag".<br>
<p>
--Water, carbon dioxide, and various bad smells.  Geologists call this<br>
"atmosphere and oceans", and steelworkers call it "flue gases".<br>
<p>
You can spin all you want, but I don't think things will seperate much more<br>
than this, any more than a bottle of ocean water will seperate into a pile<br>
of salt with fresh water on top.<br>
