<i>&gt; "It is my firm belief that it is a mistake to hold firm beliefs"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But I ask myself, 'how can we move forward if we have no firm beliefs to</i><br>
<i>&gt; spring from?'</i><br>
<p>
Solipsism may be uncomfortable to accept, but it seems to me that <br>
it's the closest thing I've seen to an absolute truth.  That isn't as <br>
self contradictory as it may sound.  Solipsism doesn't preclude the <br>
existence of absolute truth, but only absolute knowlege of the truth.<br>
<p>
Living with that philosophy is not what a "believer" might expect.<br>
Severing all dependence on outside definitions of "meaning" allows<br>
life to have whatever meaning we choose to give it.  Which, if we<br>
choose, can go far beyond any "canned" sense of meaning that might<br>
come from one of the ready-made paths to enlightenment that religion<br>
may offer.  Beauty can exist wherever we choose to see it.  Hardly<br>
the bland, nihilistic world that some might mislead you to expect.<br>
<p>
As for how one progresses without a foundation of faith, it isn't so<br>
difficult really.  We decide what seems most likely to be true, and<br>
act upon it with full knowlege that we may be wrong.  Having a "plan<br>
B" can improve the odds, but the B plan can be as disfunctional as<br>
the A plan.  We place our bets, and we take our chances.  Those with<br>
a "solid" foundation of belief may perceive life as something other<br>
than this, but they're rolling their dice just like the rest of us.<br>
<p>

    "Why are we here?<br>
     Because we're here.<br>
     Roll the bones"<br>
     -- Neil Peart<br>

<p>
I prefer genuine ignorance over false knowlege.<br>
