<i>        &gt;As for the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?"         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;there isn't, what we percieve as something is nothing.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then why is there nothing rather than something? Anyway, isn't perception something?<br>
                <br>

<p>
<p>
Either that or it was random, that is based on nothing. I know of no law of <br>
logic that demands that every effect have a cause.<br>
                <br>

<i>        &gt;I have no idea why you would consider the soul and consciousness as         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the same thing.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
The soul as I understand it is something important, the only important thing <br>
about me, the only important thing in the universe, is consciousness.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Information is 'about' physical things.  It must be representing         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;something physical and it must be represented by something physical.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
If I am sad, frightened, angry and jealous then I am feeling 4 emotions.    <br>
Are Emotions something physical?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;How are you defining the soul exactly ?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The essential thing that makes me be me. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If the soul is like information, what is the information on ?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Information on the position and velocity of atoms.<br>
                <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;An abstraction would only seem the same, on a physical level it         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;would not be identical and nor would it react the same.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by "an abstraction" but I agree, if something does <br>
not react the same then it is not the same, I was supposing it did.<br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;It seems to me that the mind is what the brain does, if two brains         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;are doing the same thing then there is only one mind.</i><br>
         <br>
<i>        &gt;Only if they occupy the exact same space, otherwise they are seperate.          </i><br>
<i>        &gt;All of the differences between seperate objects are due to position         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and movement.</i><br>
         <br>
By itself a brain can not detect it's position, a brain can't detect anything, <br>
only the position of the brain's sense organs is important. It's not just <br>
space, a brain can't detect time either, I could stop your brain for a <br>
billion years and then restart it and you would never know unless your senses <br>
told you.<br>
