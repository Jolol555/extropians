<i>&gt; Warhol was a magician who created a currency and laughed all the way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the bank</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would like to ask, 'what is the differnce between this artist sorcerer</i><br>
<i>&gt; and any scientist who has a particular 'theory'?'</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Surely both are playing the currency game and neither represent any</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective truth.</i><br>
<p>
The currency Warhol traded in was exactly the same as all others, and<br>
very real: human desire.  The theories created by science or economics or<br>
any other philosophy are every bit as quantifiable and testable as Mr.<br>
Warhol's bank account.<br>
<p>
Anyone who believes there is no objective truth I sentence to standing<br>
in the middle of the street and choosing not to believe in the bus<br>
heading toward you.<br>
