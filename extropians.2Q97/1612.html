Nay, Heretic!!  It is you that will be smitten!!  The true messiah is the <br>
Anti-Max on the Anti-Earth that hides behind the Sun.  Their space prgram<br>
is farther along than ours, so the spaceships should be arriving soon.<br>
They are coming for our heads :-)<br>
<p>
I jest, but seriously, does anyone know the names of the sources mentioned<br>
earlier listing Extropians as a cult?  WOuld it do any good to contact<br>
these people and tell them they're wrong, at least as far as the popular<br>
connotaion of "cult" goes?  Or would that be percieved  like Scientologists <br>
attacking all critics by saying, "We're not paraniod, you're trying to destroy<br>
our religion!"<br>
<p>
Are there any laws banning "cult" activities?  Should Extropians beware,<br>
or I am just paraniod? <br>
