I haven't read the book, but I have heard that there are some valid <br>
self-transformation techniques in it. That is the secret of Scientology: <br>
it actually works when people try it, so they want to learn more and get <br>
better, all the way to the Thetans and Xenu...<br>
<p>
The engram is a term used in psychology to refer to the "memory record" <br>
of a person. Quite a bit of research has been done attempting to find it <br>
(Lasley's famous ablation failures are most important), and today it is <br>
generally believed to be encoded in the network connections of the brain <br>
in a rather non-localized manner.<br>
<p>
What Hubbard refers to are suppressed painful memories possibly from past<br>
lives. I don't buy the past life part, but all people seem to react<br>
strongly to signals that threaten their identity or peace of mind, even if<br>
they don't consciously think they are threatening (why do my blood<br>
pressure rise steeply when I read *stupid* attacks on transhumanism, but<br>
not when I read logical and well reasoned attacks? Maybe it is the<br>
stupidity that affects me more than the attack). <br>
