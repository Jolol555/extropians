I like Japan too, but it has its problems. Although far less than any <br>
communist country, government does indeed engage in a lot of intervention in <br>
Japan, and the level is far greater than the optimal amount (zero). The same <br>
thing is true of the USA, both would be much better off without any of it. <br>
I can only think of 3 areas where Japan has substantially more regulation <br>
than the USA.<br>
<p>
1) Agriculture<br>
2) Domestic Retailing<br>
3) Telecommunications<br>
<p>
I do not think it's a coincidence that those are also the 3 areas where<br>
Japan is furthest behind.<br>

<i>        &gt;Quite simple.</i><br>
<i>        &gt;1) Media propaganda. </i><br>
        2) Financial support by US secret services <br>
                                             <br>
<p>
If you have really been able to convince yourself that these silly reasons <br>
are sufficient to explain why over the last 38 years millions of people have<br>
permanently abandoned all their possessions and been eager to undergo an <br>
horribly dangerous and unpleasant voyage so they can live in capitalistic <br>
land full of strange customs where their language is not even spoken,  then I <br>
can only conclude that your critical thinking skills, at least in economics <br>
and politics, have been destroyed by a malignant socialist meme.<br>
