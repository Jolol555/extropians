<i>&gt;&gt; I'm not sure why you think people's preferences regarding nudity would</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;... common areas are extremely restrictive, largely to prevent residents</i><br>
<i>&gt;from disturbing each other's quiet enjoyment of their homes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A park, on the other hand, is not directly near someone's home.</i><br>
<p>
Nudity is noisy then?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;To the Victorians, who rarely saw a naked ankle, even the sight of an</i><br>
<i>&gt;ankle was a charged experience.  To those who see the naked form</i><br>
<i>&gt;repeatedly, it becomes uninteresting or even banal.  Indeed, one might</i><br>
<i>&gt;note that the degree of bodily exposure considered "uninteresting" in</i><br>
<i>&gt;our society has dropped radically over the last century. ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is not unreasonable to assume that the existance of places</i><br>
<i>&gt;open to the general public at which large numbers of people were</i><br>
<i>&gt;"routinely" unclothed would lead to further erosion of current</i><br>
<i>&gt;societal norms on body modesty as fewer and fewer people noticed or</i><br>
<i>&gt;eroticized nudity qua nudity.</i><br>
<p>
The question is whether recent historical trends are a one-time<br>
historical transition, or whether it is more a matter of cycles,<br>
multiple equilibria, and other contextual effects.  Maybe both the very<br>
prudish and the routinely nude cultures are self-consistent equilibria<br>
in certain contexts.  But most of human history has been between these<br>
extremes, and so absent a reason to expect some fundamentally new<br>
development, I'd expect future culture to also lie within historical<br>
ranges.<br>
