  From one of the religion-and-genetics posts:<br>
<p>
<i>  &gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>  &gt; ...assume that there is Some Big Smart Entity out there...</i><br>
<i>  &gt; [...]</i><br>
<p>
  I think some of us are a bit too hasty to dismiss the possible<br>
  existence of Some Big Smart Entity. Given reasonable assumptions, the<br>
  present existence of such an Entity is inescapable. If you believe that:<br>
<p>
  1) Evolution to unlimited power and intelligence has a nonzero<br>
     probability of occuring, given a reasonably complex universe;<br>
  and<br>
<p>
  2) Reasonably complex universes have existed, at least<br>
     occasionally, throughout an infinite past;<br>
     (It seems unlikely that our own Big Bang could have been the<br>
     only one to ever occur.)<br>
  and<br>
<p>
  3) Given infinite past time, anything having a nonzero probability<br>
     will have happened;<br>
<p>
  it follows logically that<br>
<p>
  4) Evolution to unlimited power and knowledge has already happened.<br>
     That is, the "Big Smart Entity", or "God", or whatever you want<br>
     to call Hir, does in fact exist.<br>
<p>
  Forget the Ontological, Cosmological, and Teleological Arguments.<br>
  The Evolutionary Argument for the Existence of God rules.<br>
<p>
  Now the really interesting question:<br>
<p>
  Why, after infinite past time, with Some Big Smart Entity having<br>
  surely evolved by now, do we find ourselves in a universe with more<br>
  than a sextillion stars wastefully dissipating their energy; i.e. a<br>
  universe full of chaos and entropy?<br>
<p>
<p>
  This is, perhaps, an extrauniversal extension of Fermi's Paradox: a<br>
  typical intergalactic civilization should be able to do a great deal to<br>
  control cosmic entropy, slapping Dyson spheres around all those stars<br>
  to prevent their waste of energy and whatnot. So why do we live in such<br>
  a wasteful galaxy, among so many other wasteful galaxies? As Fermi<br>
  asked, "Where are they?" And why aren't they cleaning things up?<br>
<p>
  Going on to consider the likelihood that Big Smart Entities of<br>
  unlimited power and intelligence exist, somewhere, having had infinite<br>
  past time in which to develop, why haven't they organized all of<br>
  Reality by now?<br>
<p>
  Possible types of explanations: they can't organize all of Reality;<br>
  they don't care to organize all of Reality; or they in fact don't<br>
  exist.<br>
<p>
  1) Big Smart Entities (BSEs) are incapable of influencing this<br>
  universe. This would imply that<br>
<p>
    1a) There has been as yet no evolution to unlimited power and<br>
    intelligence in this particular universe.<br>
  and<br>
    1b) BSEs that evolve in other spacetime bubbles are forever<br>
    confined to those bubbles, no matter how far they advance in<br>
    power and intelligence, so that they are incapable of influencing<br>
    All of Reality in general, and our universe in particular.<br>
    That is, there are in fact some ultimate limits to the<br>
    implementation of power and intelligence.<br>
<p>
  In addition to being a bit depressing, I find (1b) implausible.<br>
  Even our lowly pre-interstellar race is beginning to conceive of<br>
  theoretical possibilities for wormholing out of this spacetime bubble.<br>
<p>
  2) BSEs are able but not willing to impose order on our universe.<br>
<p>
  Perhaps they find universes full of entropy interesting to watch<br>
  from time to time. Perhaps they are completely involved in virtual<br>
  realities, completely unconcerned with our universe.<br>
<p>
  I have trouble with this explanation as well. Given infinite past<br>
  time and infinitely many universes, BSEs will have evolved not once,<br>
  but (if allowed by previous BSEs) infinitely many times. If only *one*<br>
  of them wants to impose order on our messy spacetime bubble, it will<br>
  have been done.<br>
<p>
  3) Perhaps Reality is not infinite after all, and no BSE has yet<br>
  evolved - i.e., perhaps there was an Ultimate First Event a finite<br>
  number of events ago, with not enough time yet for a BSE to evolve.<br>
<p>
  Again, I have a hard time with this possibility. An Ultimate Limit<br>
  on past events just seems counterintuitive to me.<br>
<p>
  But this seems to exhaust the possible types of explanation.<br>
<p>
  So, in sympathy with Fermi, I'm wondering not only "Why are there no<br>
  signs of extraterrestrial extropic activity?" but, even more,<br>
  "Where are the infinitely advanced extrauniversal intelligences?"<br>
  Why, after infinite time for power/intelligence to evolve, does a big<br>
  chunk of Reality remain out of control?<br>
