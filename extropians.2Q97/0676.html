I am no geologist.  I am no economist.  To say we are running out of any <br>
mineral (except oil) just basically seems silly.  The earth's crust should <br>
be strewn with every mineral known to man (and then some....wood and air is <br>
a far more known limiter).  It may take a little bit more searching and <br>
deeper digging to find them but we have only scratched the resources.  Oil <br>
may be an exception, but we may still have vast resources we haven't found. <br>
 Oil may also be in it's last gasps.  Shale oil is another matter.  But <br>
chromium?  Copper?  Tin?  Nickel?  The 'mother lodes' of these minerals are <br>
probably just the tip of the iceberg of resources hiding in the crust (the <br>
deepest mine is only a mile or two down, correct?  Anyone attempted mining <br>
Greenland?)  Prices may rise, because the monopolies can do it, but we <br>
won't run out of these metals.<br>
<p>
The popular belief we ARE running out of basic minerals may spawn a new <br>
interest in space travel/space engineering as we can get these from the <br>
moon and/or asteroids, a good thing.<br>

You could name your own terms: select any raw material you wanted - <br>
copper,<br>
tin, whatever - and select any date in the future, "any date more than a<br>
year away," and Simon would bet that the commodity's price on that date<br>
would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager.<br>
<p>
Ehrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would<br>
undergo big price rises: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. <br>
Then,<br>
on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using<br>
the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September <br>
29,<br>
1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices<br>
of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the<br>
combined difference; if the prices fell, Ehrlich et alia would pay Simon.<br>

<p>
Between 1980 and 1990, the world's population grew by more than 800 <br>
million,<br>
the largest increase in one decade in all of history. But by September <br>
1990,<br>
without a single exception, the price of each of Ehrlich's selected metals<br>
had fallen, and in some cases had dropped through the floor. Chrome, which<br>
had sold for $3.90 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.70 in 1990. Tin, which<br>
was $8.72 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.88 a decade later.<br>
<p>
Which is how it came to pass that in October 1990, Paul Ehrlich mailed<br>
Julian Simon a check for $576.07 . . . .<br>
