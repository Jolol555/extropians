<i>&gt; 	"Most" ?  Is this somewhere between 51 % and 99 %?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, that's the generally accepted definition of 'most'. In this case it<br>
may be &gt;99% though. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Can you be more exact?</i><br>
<p>
No. Never done any real research. But I've noticed such experiences with<br>
most of the people I know well and I know I have a few unexpurgated<br>
buttons myself. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	What are those people who do not have "buttons" like?</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	Are they emotionless, comatose, non-productive entities?</i><br>
<p>
I don't know; I've never met one but I can imagine that they exist<br>
somewhere. However I'd suspect your conception of them is 180 degrees out<br>
of sync. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 		4. egoitsm, or self-importance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; 		5. self-esteem or self-image; feelings.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, so two of the definitions here basically match mine. The point I was<br>
trying to make was not that the dictionary gave some particular definition<br>
but that often in the past I'd spoken to people who would talk and talk<br>
about 'ego', but when I asked them what they meant by the word they umm-ed<br>
and ahh-ed and failed to define it. They talk about this thing, they claim<br>
to have one, but don't actually know what it is. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; This was taken out of a direction-ary....you know, the book which gives</i><br>
<i>&gt; directions on the use of words?</i><br>
<p>
Uh yes, I know what a dictionary is.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Would you suggest that Socrates' admonition to "Know thyself." </i><br>
<i>&gt; applies in this 	modern age?</i><br>
<p>
Yes. Why shouldn't it? <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 	What do you consider "ego nonsense"?</i><br>
<p>
The fact that we all like to regard ourselves as somehow better than we<br>
really are. Even the most deranged killers think that they have a good<br>
reason for what they do. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	How would someone "know" they were seeing themselves as they "truly are?</i><br>
<p>
Because their internal model of themselves would match their actions. If,<br>
say, I was to go around telling everyone that I was going to be a famous<br>
writer yet I never wrote anything, then I would clearly have an ego<br>
problem and would never attain my goal until I solved it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	How does seeing oneself as one truly is, help to see your life the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; way 	any other individual sees their own life?</i><br>
<p>
Uh, can you start that question again? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	How were they programmed?</i><br>
<p>
Input data =&gt; neural net =&gt; output data. Reinforcement of input leads to<br>
reinforcement of pathways leads to reinforcement of output. Go and read<br>
about Skinner Boxes sometime. Or take a martial arts or dance class; both<br>
program your body and brain by repeating the movements until they stick,<br>
and both are useful and fun. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Were other entities involved?</i><br>
<p>
Maybe, maybe not. Perhaps deliberately, or perhaps not. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Do you think you are 'just' a computer?</i><br>
<p>
There's no neurophysiological evidence to think otherwise, unless the<br>
quantum mechanical effects in the brain are truly significant. You cannot<br>
conclusively prove that we don't have 'souls', but there seems little<br>
point when the vast majority of human behaviour can be explained without<br>
them. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Is this just another way of simplifying humans?</i><br>
<p>
I don't really understand the question, but if anything I'd say it's<br>
another way of complexifying humans. Claiming that we're 'souls' in<br>
physical bodies is a much greater simplification. If we accept that we are<br>
computers then exploring the precise details of our operation will be<br>
extremely complex. Frankly I find the idea of humans as computers far more<br>
bizzare and puzzling than the idea of humans as immortal souls incarnated<br>
in flesh. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 	Have you worked out how to activate it yet?</i><br>
<p>
Yes.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	If you have, could you share the programming, or do you sell it?</i><br>
<p>
Nope. It's not something you can tell to anyone; they have to go out and<br>
find it for themselves, though you could point them in the right direction<br>
as the Buddhists try to do. You'll just have to trust that the switch<br>
exists and go hunting for yours by yourself. Anyone who claims that they<br>
can tell you how to do it is trying to sell a religion. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Also, if you have, do you prefer to turn your own "joy button" on or do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you 	prefer having interactions with other people ('love', etc.) ?</i><br>
<p>
I prefer interactions with other people, I just know that it's a natural<br>
brain-state which I turn on by my own actions so I don't make such a fuss<br>
about it as they do. I don't meet someone and think that I could never be<br>
happy without them because I know that I can switch on that circuitry<br>
pretty much at will. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; 	Does not "utter" mean complete, total, absolute?</i><br>
<p>
Uh-huh. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Do you know what 69% bliss is like?</i><br>
<p>
Roughly. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	How do you arrive at the percentage of bliss less than 100%?</i><br>
<p>
Because 100% bliss would require that I shut down all processing in my<br>
brain except for the bliss-circuits. I've never been there, but I've been<br>
close. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Can you have a 46% orgasm?</i><br>
<p>
Yes, but I much prefer 100%. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	"claim that this is letting in "god".....What do the people who </i><br>
<i>&gt; have these</i><br>
<i>&gt; 	experiences claim it is?</i><br>
<p>
Been there, done that. I sort of agree if you use 'letting in god' in the<br>
sense of Crowley's 'true will'. A lot of mystics have talked about moving<br>
out of the way and letting 'god' work thru them. This seems to be what<br>
they're talking about; the idea that 'god' created us with our 'true<br>
wills/true natures' and that the way to follow the 'will of god' is to<br>
find your 'true will' and follow that. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	How is it important in an evolutionary sense, regarding consciousness?</i><br>
<p>
Because erecting a barrier between yourself and reality and calling it<br>
'ego' is a sure way to get into lots and lots of trouble. Of course,<br>
eliminating it and sitting in cave going 'Aum' and blissing out is just as<br>
bad. <br>
