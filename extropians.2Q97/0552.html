Theatre Games by Viola Spolin.  Mind Magic by Bill Harvey.<br>
Spolin is responsible in large part for Second City.  Many members of<br>
Saturday Night Live came from there, as did Alan Alda, Alan Arkin, George<br>
Segal, Peter Falk, and Barbara Hershey.  Many of todays' most creative<br>
actors began with classes wherein the teacher used this book as a textbook,<br>
including Whoopi and Robin Williams.  Neither of these books teach<br>
anything, they let you learn by experiencing.  Mind Magic is more of an<br>
introduction to yourself and your programming.  It is more suitable for the<br>
extropian types who are interested in reprogramming themselves.  But it<br>
does require that you actually do something besides just read the book,<br>
although that too is useful.  <br>
