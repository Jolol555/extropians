     Hi again,<br>
     <br>
     In my previous e-mail today, I meant to attach a quote that I got from <br>
     a guy by the name of Michael Ventura who used to (may still) write for <br>
     LA Weekly.  The quote was to underscore my feeling about how overt <br>
     materialism preoccupies (at best) or sedates/immobilizes (at worst) <br>
     our citizenry.<br>
     <br>
     "This is the death of the Republic: When the people clamor to be <br>
     shielded from reality, when they praise their government for keeping <br>
     things from them, when they choose to conduct their lives within the <br>
     limits of whatever fantasy the government supplies, then they are no <br>
     longer consenting to be governed, they are begging to be ruled."<br>
     <br>
     Don't know if there are any "magic pills" out there to be the <br>
     stimulant needed to shake off more of the complacency that dulls the <br>
     senses of many in this culture but I'm hopeful that benevolent <br>
     thinkers and feelers, perhaps within the ranks of Extropians, will <br>
     emerge that will rally our resources together not only to take <br>
     responsibility but to act zealously to improve our communities and <br>
     restore our environment.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
