: So as extropians looking at the political arena, we must look at the<br>
: best "Intelligent Technology" to win elections. THAT is the prime<br>

: later. We need a slick, savvy, intelligent, photogenic person as a<br>
: mouthpiece, and once elected, work change from the shadows. Deceitful?<br>
: perhaps. The way things are done already in most other parties?<br>
: Definitely.<br>
<p>
Winning elections is the purpose of a political movement<br>
like killing foreigners is the purpose of an army.<br>
<p>
Would you lie about your goals to get elected?<br>

: As a 28 year old, I cannot run in the important elections for another<br>
: 7 years. There is an Ohio Senatorial race in my 35th year, and I will<br>
: be running.<br>
<p>
You're already old enough for Congress (25).<br>
At 30 you can run for Senate.<br>
Only the Presidency requires 35 years.<br>
<p>
At what age does the typical American stop daydreaming<br>
about running for President as soon as he's eligible?  ;)<br>
