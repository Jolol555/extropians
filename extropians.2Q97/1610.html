<i>&gt;How is cult defined, anyway? A group sharing a common set of beliefs </i><br>
<i>&gt;noticeably different than those of the average Joe? Then I'd guess we are </i><br>
<i>&gt;a cult. (Hey, who will be passing around special kool-aid at Extro3 ?)</i><br>
<p>
You've reminded me of an auxilary concern here.  Last year, in <br>
addition to crashing Julf's remailer, the Scientologists drove the <br>
Cult Awareness Network into bankruptcy and bought it outright.  When <br>
people call CAN to see if their kid is mixed up with a cult, they get <br>
a Scientologist on the line and who knows what kind of 'information'.<br>
