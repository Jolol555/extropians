No. If your potentials were reset, you would lose your short-term memory<br>
(and perhaps some intermediate-term memory), but not your long-term<br>
memory, which seems to reside in synaptic strengths and connectivity<br>
(i.e. "hardware"). People who nearly has drowned in cold rivers have<br>
been revived after fairly long periods of no brain activity with no<br>
loss of identity.<br>
<p>
(Strictly speaking, a brain in total equilibrium is by definition a<br>
dead brain, but here we are speaking more about equilibrium of<br>
sodium, potassium and other neuroelectrically important ions. There<br>
is also no reason not to think the revival process can't handle some <br>
ion leakage if it can handle the other damage)<br>
<p>

<p>
Judging from studies done on ECT patients, they might lose memory a<br>
few months back. Not that bad for escaping death (and a good start<br>
for an science fiction story: the protagonist awakens from biostasis<br>
only to find out that had been murdered. The only witness was himself<br>
and the murderer, and he can't remember who it was. So the murderer<br>
could be *anyone* in his vicinity... ).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, on a more technical side, is liquid Nitrogen capable of stopping</i><br>
<i>&gt; ion/molecular transport, or just slowing it down?</i><br>
<p>
I would say it does, since once all the water has frozen all ion<br>
channels are blocked (and the ions themselves frozen in place). Some<br>
diffusion and tunneling will occur, but it is likely extremely slow.<br>

Thanks for asking about something I really do know something about... <br>
