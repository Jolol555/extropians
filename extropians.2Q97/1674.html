<p>
Nanotech is a great concept and a fine thing to work on but<br>
I don't think it is the shortest path to dealing with the problem<br>
of aging.  Nanotech is similar to computers, in that<br>
you will have many different generations of the technology.  I<br>
think machine intelligence and nanotechnology are the essence<br>
of where we are going but I can see simpler routes to some of<br>
the basic problems with our bodies.<br>
<p>
Using nanotech to stop aging is still going to require an <br>
understanding of the body.  The various nano devices will have<br>
to be designed.  It may be possible to redesign much of the body<br>
from scratch but the brain will require greater faithfulness<br>
to the original.<br>
<p>
I know it sounds like a kludge but I think in the short term <br>
preserving and augmenting the brain by a combination of understanding <br>
(neuronal processes and neuronal aging), pharmacy, gene therapy,<br>
and partial replacement with computer circuits will buy time until<br>
complete brain replacement is possible.  Some simple nanotech could<br>
help a lot here but I don't think it is required.<br>
<p>
One nice sideline of the neuro approach is the likelihood of<br>
stumbling onto ways to augment human intelligence.  Personally<br>
I'd just as soon stay smarter than the computers until I am at<br>
least part computer myself.  I don't think its terribly <br>
important but I appeals to me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;This year it looks like software development is one</i><br>
<i>&gt;route toward molecular nanotechnology that might help, so I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;working on acquiring skills in that area, and I'm also trying to</i><br>
<i>&gt;bone up on some of the chemistry I've already studied and some of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the engineering I've never studied before.</i><br>
<p>
Up until about a year ago I thought working on molecular <br>
modeling software while trying to use as much machine<br>
intelligence as possible and paying a lot of attention to protein<br>
chemistry and neurochemistry was the prefect start.  From <br>
there one is positioned to go in a lot of directions and is<br>
unlikely to be poor in the mean time.  <br>
<p>
Now I feel the main thing to be done is to understand the aging <br>
brain, figure out how to keep it alive, and improve it's functioning.<br>
This is a more conservative approach.  I see this as the number<br>
one problem we face and until I really understand what is the<br>
minimum requirement to solve the problem of brain aging I am not <br>
willing to assume it will be easy or hard and I am not willing to<br>
skip ahead.<br>
<p>
For me all of this is just conceptual for a while.  My own<br>
current idea is to do as much as I can to take advantage of the<br>
technologies, skills, etc. currently available to keep me alive<br>
and functioning at my best, and to help others do the same.<br>
I think this makes sense for anyone who has not already done it<br>
because I don't know how long the big stuff will take, because<br>
it is comparatively easy (it lets me do something I can make<br>
progress at in a time frame my mind can grasp), and it will help <br>
me be more capable of progress on the big stuff when I get there.<br>
<p>
Of course even the simple stuff isn't that simple.  How do I know<br>
which supplements make sense without some aging theory? What are<br>
my favorite ways to gain lots of additional benefits from my work <br>
while making a comfortable living?  Which things present meaningful <br>
short term risks and which are not significant enough to bother <br>
with. Etc.  The long term guesses do help some.<br>
<p>
Anyway Eric, your strategy seems fine to me; it is hard to go wrong<br>
with computation or chemistry paired with a keen mind.  I would love<br>
to hear more about why you think nanotechnology is the shortest path<br>
though.<br>
