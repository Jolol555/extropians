Horses are useful.  Zebras are like horses.  Horses can't live in lots<br>
of Africa, because of tsetse flies.  Most of Africa has known about<br>
livestock; Diamond claims much Bantu livestock near the Sahel is<br>
Eurasian in origin, which managed to trickle across the Sahara.  Bantu<br>
farmers moving south left livestock behind because the livestock kept<br>
dying.  Zebras would be useful.  But zebras are nasty; they don't let go<br>
when they bite, and they duck lassos.  Zebras have not been domesticated.<br>
In the past or by modern humans, who've tried again.<br>
<p>
Neither have elephants; wild ones get tamed, at least in India, but they<br>
haven't been bred and modified by humans.  And African elephants don't get<br>
tamed.  Hannibal's were presumably African, but I think I've heard they<br>
were an extinct breed.  (My reliability is deteriorating.)<br>
<p>
Cheetahs have been tamed or domesticated as hunting cats.  Tigers and<br>
lions haven't been.<br>
<p>
Why did no North Americans become nomadic bison herders, like herders of<br>
cattle, sheep, and goats in the Old World?<br>
<p>
Proposal: most animals, for one reason or another, just aren't<br>
domesticable.  Small mammals you can try breeding as you want anyway;<br>
it's easy to play god to a gerbil or pigeon.  (I heard about Coast Guard<br>
pigeons being used to rescue people years ago; I'd forgotten about it.<br>
They peck a button when they see bright orange.  Source: 3-2-1 Contact a<br>
long time ago.)  I don't know if there's any guarantee you'll succeed.<br>
Or that it'll be economical for mortals to try.  If it takes 300 years<br>
to breed an animal to a useful state, who's going to keep at it for that<br>
long?  Knowing more about how dogs and horses got bred would be useful,<br>
but presumably being useful and controllable in the wild state was<br>
rather significant; after that maybe a royal breeder can start some long<br>
term project.<br>
<p>
I think I've heard the word "fragile" applied to great apes,<br>
particularly in response to wounds or disease.  Wait five to ten years<br>
for the gorilla to grow up, spend many years training it to do its job<br>
*and* to interact safely with humans (gorilla might be smart enough to<br>
figure out that it _is_ stronger than all the pale midgets around it)<br>
and then it dies of the flu.  Or cold.  Nice profitable investment you<br>
have here.<br>
<p>
And what's a primate?  Curious, fairly intelligent, playful, and<br>
manipulative.  And verbally autistic.  What's the market for dumb but<br>
mischievous humans you can't talk to?  Monkeys may be too small to be<br>
too useful, and the apes' generation time is too long.<br>
<p>
I see no reason to assume an AI, human-level or not, would be as<br>
intractable as most animals.  (Apart from the non-existence problem<br>
right now.)  You can perhaps imitate the neural structure of nice<br>
animals; you can have not built in nastiness in the first place; their<br>
structure can be directly modified to see what happens, rather than just<br>
breeding two animals with nice bloodlines and praying; and software AIs<br>
running on SuperHexium or CAM-arrays can be even more easily modified,<br>
or could be evolved at some speed.  And they shouldn't bite, shit, or<br>
get sick.  (Brittleware has advantages Eugene: parasites can't spin out<br>
and evolve so well.)<br>

Merry part,<br>
