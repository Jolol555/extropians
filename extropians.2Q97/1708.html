John K Clark &lt;johnkc@well.com&gt; protested:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What's this "we" business? The only feelings you can detect directly</i><br>
<i>&gt; are your own, if you reject the evidence of behavior then there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; no reason you could not be the only conscious being in the universe.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes!  As long as we are trapped inside our own spirit world we<br>
can't "eff" feelings.  As long as we don't scientifically understand<br>
them they are ineffable.<br>
<p>
	But, once we discover what they are, how and why they are<br>
produced we will be able to eff them.  We will be able to produce a<br>
stimulus inside your brain after possibly altering a few neurons and<br>
say to you: "This is what salt tastes like to someone else".  you<br>
might reply after experiencing the sensation: "Whoa, that isn't what<br>
salt tastes like to me!"  Then you will know for sure that the other<br>
person, though different than yourself, most definitely is conscious!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Consciousness is overrated, you can get along fine without it. I'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; let you in on a little secret, I am not conscious and never have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been, I've been on the Extropian list for several years now and if</i><br>
<i>&gt; anybody has suspected my lack of sentience nobody has been unkind</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough to say so.</i><br>
<p>
	Yes, it is very possible that you are telling the truth.<br>
(Although I doubt mere abstract representations could achieve the<br>
particular kind of intelligence you have without absurdly extreme<br>
amounts of bruit force.  How many bits of information must be used to<br>
record all the possible appropriate answers to the question: "What is<br>
blue like"?  It has to be much more efficient to just honestly<br>
reproduce an actual blue sensation.) Today, as you say, we do not have<br>
a way to know for sure.  But, when we discover what blue really is and<br>
how it is produced we will be able to observe the particular<br>
neural/chemical behavior that corresponds to or produces a blue<br>
conscious experience and know for sure if you are lying.  Just because<br>
we can't YET do it doesn't me it is impossible.  Have a little<br>
faith. :)<br>
