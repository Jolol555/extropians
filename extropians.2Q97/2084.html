<p>
Dear Hagbard and other fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
At the unfortunate risk of being disagreable I have to state that in the<br>
real world coercion has very little to do with drafting and enacting<br>
legislation. <br>
Legislation is, in the first instance, not usually written by politicians. <br>
<p>
Legislative drafting is a learned professional skill that many law schools<br>
do not teach. Those of us who write legislation as our livelihood<br>
frequently do so in response to a social problem or need. Very often the<br>
social problems or needs that we attempt to resolve legislatively are<br>
brought to our attention by the effected groups.<br>
On other occasions those of us who have studied sociology and/or psychology<br>
in addition to Public Administration, Public Policy and Law will do our own<br>
research and apply our findings to legislation. <br>
<p>
Obviously, drafting and enacting legislation is no the sum total of all<br>
things. The act of effective implimentation must also be considered. Where<br>
on occasion coercion does take place, it is usually at the bureaucratic<br>
level in attemping to induce compliance from those whose job it is to<br>
enforce the statutes or regulations that they had no part in creating and<br>
were usually not consulted about.<br>
<p>
At this point we are dealing with a management problem that is only<br>
slightly related to Extropian philosophy, and appears to be the antithesis<br>
of a dialogue on Anarcho Capitalism.<br>
<p>
I'll leave this tangent alone for the time being, unless someone else wants<br>
to pick it up and run with it.      <br>
<p>
Enjoy,<br>
<p>
A.M. Genen<br>
<p>
If you and I are in a conflict with each other and even if we both agree<br>
that <br>
we don't want the Supreme Court to be the final arbiter and we want<br>
somebody <br>
else, it doesn't matter, we're stuck with those bozos.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Anyone who signs the contract (we can call them "citizens") </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then I am not a citizen of any country, of course you will say that my<br>
heart <br>
is beating and that is my implicit signature.<br>
<p>
PPA's are not euphemisms for states because PPA's do not claim powers that <br>
individuals do not have. There are only 3 ways to get somebody to do<br>
something <br>
you want, love, trade, or force. I like to encourage the first two and keep<br>
<p>
force to a minimum. Everybody agrees that force is justified in self<br>
defense <br>
but government claims far more rights than that, more than any sane<br>
individual <br>
or corporation would dream of. If government needs money they take it, if I<br>
<p>
object to them stealing my property they will use force to get their booty,<br>
<p>
as much force as they need to, up to and including a bullet in my brain. <br>
They will NOT take "no" for an answer. If government needs labor to fight a<br>
war or be on a jury they feel justified in enslaving me until the task is <br>
accomplished. They'll make me an offer I can't refuse because I know that<br>
if <br>
I do armed men will come to my house and drag me away. I don't think <br>
government should not have more rights than individuals, but then of<br>
course, <br>
it wouldn't be a government.                                      <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;are also allowed to live in a certain geographical area </i><br>
<p>
<p>
You can join a PPA and live in any geographical area you want.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Anarchy in the traditional sense is an absence of government. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Exactly, it is not the absence of law.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Just look at the world prior to WWI. Treat each country as an     </i><br>
   <br>
<i>        &gt;individual person. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Treat horse manure as ice cream and you could have strawberries and ice<br>
cream, <br>
if you had some strawberries.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The history of international relations until WWI is a study in    </i><br>
   <br>
<i>        &gt;anarchy. Accordingly, the history of humanity is the history of</i><br>
war         <br>
<i>        &gt;between nations in an anarchic  system. </i><br>
<p>
                                                               <br>
If there were no nations there would be no war between nations.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;While I see that it is anarchic, in some sense, to have all people</i><br>
       <br>
<i>        &gt;contracting singly with all others in order to protect themselves,</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;how can this be desirable? You can't make a contract with every   </i><br>
     <br>
<i>        &gt;single person you come into contact with. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Don't be foolish, nobody is saying make a separate contract with everybody<br>
on  <br>
earth, you just sign up with a PPA of your choice. The PPA makes contracts <br>
with other PPA's about what laws to follow and how arbitration is to be  <br>
handled. You won't have total freedom of choice about what laws you want to<br>
 <br>
live by and who you want to judge you, but you'd have a lot more choice<br>
than<br>
you have now.<br>
<p>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;What about fraud, duress, or unconscionability? </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Yes, those are problems unique to Anarchy, fraud and duress and <br>
unconscionability are impossible today. <br>
<p>
            <br>
<i>        &gt;It is similarly inane to attempt to treat each specifically. There</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;must some things that are just  "understood" as common to all and </i><br>
       <br>
<i>        &gt;decent for all. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Obviously. If it was possible for law  to be completely spelled out like a <br>
<p>
theorem in Geometry then there would be no need for courts or arbitrators, <br>
but it isn't so there is.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I point to the only example I can of true  anarchy -- the world at</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;any point before WWI. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
What about the Internet?<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;the profit-motive is the final arbiter. In this situation, what</i><br>
does         <br>
<i>        &gt;one measure one's profit in? Not dollars or francs or rubles,</i><br>
because         <br>
<i>        &gt;a currency would require a large group contract which would</i><br>
"govern"         <br>
<i>        &gt;its value. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
"Money" is just something that is easy to transport, fungible, and a large <br>
number of people think is valuable. Exactly the same thing would be true in<br>
a <br>
world of Anarchy, except you would not be forced to use only the currency<br>
of <br>
the nation you were living in. If somebody tried to tax you by inflation, <br>
a great favorite among politicians today, you could just switch to a<br>
currency<br>
that was more stable.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What happens when a party declares his rubles to be worth more    </i><br>
   <br>
<i>        &gt;than the contract stipulates? Send a PPA  after him? </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I have no idea what that means.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;So then a weapons race among PPA's? Small tactical nukes built</i><br>
from         <br>
<i>        &gt;the Anarchist's Cookbook? </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Today we don't have small tactical nukes, we have huge multi-megaton<br>
doomsday   <br>
H- bombs.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I foresee a very convoluted, and profitable weapons industry      </i><br>
         <br>
        <br>
<p>
I don't know what you mean by "convoluted" but yes, I expect it would be<br>
about <br>
as profitable as the industry is now.        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;not exactly world peace, and a waste of valuable resources which </i><br>
<i>        &gt;might be used for more transhuman pursuits. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's true, a world without crime or war where everyone lived together in <br>
peace love and happiness would be better than anything I described, so<br>
would <br>
a world where the tooth fairy was real.<br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But in the U.S. republic, there's nothing one idiot can do in four</i><br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;years that the next idiot can't undo in four  years. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It takes far less than 4 years to kill you dead as a door nail. Only about<br>
25 <br>
years ago the U.S. republic forced millions of its citizens to leave their <br>
home and fight and often die in a idiotic war 12 thousand miles away that <br>
they didn't believe in. <br>
<p>
