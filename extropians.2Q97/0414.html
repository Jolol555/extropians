 <br>
Saberhagen's Berserkers? :)  But you're right, I know of no SF of<br>
that sort, presumably because the evidence obviously conflicts with it.<br>
One would have to have such a universe result from human development,<br>
and most people assume that means extinction of humans, which makes<br>
storywriting hard.<br>
<p>
Hmm.  Given that this _is_ similar to the universe I've been working on,<br>
perhaps I should try writing some SF, at least if Benford's 6 book<br>
series (can't remember the title) isn't too similar to what I have in<br>
mind.  Even if I can't make up a story I should get points for new<br>
combination of ideas.<br>
<p>
Authors may also shy away from imagining a universe where nearly all<br>
matter is biomass, fuel, or substrate.  I'm not sure I've seen any<br>
entirely alive universes, Bayesian immortals or not.  Although I read<br>
_Star Maker_ a long time ago.<br>

You can have sex, just don't reproduce with it...<br>
<p>

<p>
I'm not sure what you mean by fantasy; reading fiction or believing the<br>
tabloids?  At any rate, since both mortality and sexuality have yet to<br>
do poorly I wouldn't expect the analysis to apply, from what Robin's<br>
said.  Is fashion largely attributable to sexual competition?  Also,<br>
evolution does take time; scientific reasoning is mostly new to the past<br>
few centuries, and its large growth wouldn't be eating into the<br>
'parasites' you mention yet.<br>
