<i>&gt;Do they work or not?  A simple</i><br>
<i>&gt;question, easy to answer, with methods known for centuries.  The fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;that no one even tries to answer it is very suspicious.  I'm happy</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you feel better or think you concentrate more with them, but if</i><br>
<i>&gt;I see no reason to believe that those aren't just placebo effects,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then I'm not going to blindly pop pills on some random testimonial.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is suspicious, but I there is a lot of taboo around the idea of<br>
promoting a drug as a nootropic, or anti-aging drug, even if it does work.<br>
Most companies are very comfortable with the idea of producing drugs for<br>
"the sick". That is why most of the currently available "nootrpics" were<br>
developed to treat diseases of cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's<br>
disease. If there are any side effects, those side effects are not so<br>
acceptable when they occur in someone who doesn't *need* the drug.<br>
Maybe the information you are looking for is contained in the data for the<br>
control populations that are usually tested along with the "diseased"<br>
populations in most sudies. In order to get this data you would have to<br>
look at the original research articles, which shouldn't be too diffcult.<br>
