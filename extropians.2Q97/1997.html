You are correct, you are missing something. In Anarcho- Capitalism, there <br>
would still be police and there would still be law, but it would be private <br>
police and private law. PPL's (privately produced law) in a anarchic world <br>
would have private protection agencies (PPA's) to back them up. Disputes <br>
among PPA's would be settled by an independent arbitrator agreed to by both <br>
parties BEFORE the disagreement happened. Something like that can happen <br>
today. When companies sign complicated contracts they sometimes also agree on <br>
who will arbitrate it if differences in interpretation happen. Nobody wants <br>
to get caught up in the slow, expensive court system run by governments. The <br>
arbitrator would be paid by the case, and because he is picked by both sides, <br>
it's in his interest to be as just as possible. If he favored one side over <br>
another or made brutal or stupid decisions he would not be picked again and <br>
would need to look for a new line of work. Unlike present day judges and <br>
juries, justice would have a positive survival value for the arbitrator. <br>
                      <br>
All parties would have a reason to avoid violence if possible. The disputing <br>
parties would not want to turn their front yard into a war zone, and violence <br>
is expensive. The successful protection agencies would be more interested in <br>
making money than saving face. Most of the time this would work so I expect<br>
the total level of violence to be less than what we have now, but I'm not <br>
such a utopian as to suggest it will drop to zero. Even when force is not <br>
used the implicit threat is always there, another good reason to be civilized.<br>
                      <br>
I'm not talking about justice only for the rich. If a rich man's PPA <br>
makes unreasonable demands (beatings, sidewalk justice, I insist on my <br>
mother being the judge if I get into trouble)  it's going to need <br>
one hell of a lot of firepower to back it up. That kind of an army is <br>
expensive because of the hardware needed and because of the very high wages <br>
it will need to pay its employees for an extremely dangerous job. To pay for <br>
all this they will need to charge their clients enormous fees severely <br>
limiting their customer base and that means even higher charges. They could<br>
never get the upper hand, because the common man's PPA would be able to <br>
outspend a PPA that had outrageous demands and was just for the super rich. <br>
A yacht cost a lot more than a car, yet the Ford motor Company is far richer <br>
than all the yacht builders on the planet combined. <br>
                      <br>
No system can guarantee justice to everybody all the time but you'd have the <br>
greatest chance of finding it in Anarcho-capitalism. In a dictatorship one <br>
man's whim can lead to hell on earth, I don't see how 40 million Germans <br>
could have murdered 6 million Jews in a Anarcho-capitalistic world. Things<br>
aren't much better in a Democracy, 51% can decide to kill the other 49% ,  <br>
nothing even close to that is possible in Anarchy, even theoretically .    <br>
                      <br>
In general, the desire not to be killed is much stronger than the desire to <br>
kill a stranger, even a Jewish  stranger. Jews  would be willing to pay as <br>
much as necessary, up to and including their entire net worth not to be <br>
killed. I doubt if even the most rabid anti Semite would go much beyond 2%. <br>
As a result the PPA protecting Jews  would be much stronger than the one that <br>
wants to kill them. In Anarchy, for things that are REALLY important to you <br>
(like not getting  killed) you have much more influence than just one man <br>
one vote.   <br>
