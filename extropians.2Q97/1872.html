I think both of you are slightly right, slightly wrong (talk about a<br>
definite stand! :-) The creative act needs both dreaming/imagination,<br>
the creation of new and unlikely ideas, and critical analysis to get<br>
rid of those 99% which are pure junk and implement the good ideas; <br>
this happens to a large extent almost subconsciously and forms an<br>
integral system. Overly critical thinking strangles creativity, and<br>
overly imaginative thinking never gets anywhere. <br>
<p>
Nothing in the mind is disjoint from everything else, our modularity<br>
is not very good; most of our mental abilities overlap in nontrivial<br>
ways. Of course, imagination and analytical thinking are basically<br>
different processes, but they are closely intertwined even if it is<br>
not obvious. <br>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure about that. Ok, I doubt you would get any worse<br>
by trainign both, but cross-talk does occur when we learn to do<br>
different things with the same part of the brain. If they are<br>
different enough there is no problem, but similar actions easily get<br>
mixed up with each other. There is also interference from older<br>
memories; for example, I have some trouble with some falling<br>
techniques in ninjutsu because of old motor programs (likely<br>
from my childhood) which kick in when they shouldn't. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; They have nothing to do with each other, and discussing them</i><br>
<i>&gt; together and calling them a continuum of sorts just feeds our</i><br>
<i>&gt; prejudices that they are somehow at odds, and that perception can</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause genuine harm by perpetuating stereotypes like "artist" and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "nerd" based on that mistake. </i><br>
<p>
That is a good point. Placing things on a line tends to suggest a<br>
dichotomy. It would be better to see it as a complete graph, where<br>
each mental ability forms a vertex...<br>
