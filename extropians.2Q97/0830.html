Whatever Gamma Ray Bursters are (an Industrial accident?) they're really odd <br>
and we now know, the most powerful thing since The Big Bang. They happen once  <br>
or twice a week in our observable universe, come from random directions, last  <br>
from several seconds to several hours, never come twice from the same place, <br>
and produce incredibly  intense Gamma rays, but very little in any other part <br>
of the electromagnetic spectrum, not even X rays. Just a few weeks ago for the <br>
first time, a very faint optical and X ray counterpart to a Gamma ray Burst <br>
was detected. A satellite found Gamma rays of enormous magnitude, at exactly <br>
the same time another detector in space with better resolution found a weak <br>
X ray source. The Hubble telescope was quickly turned to the spot and at the <br>
very limits of its sensitivity found a extremely faint optical dot in a <br>
Galaxy several billion light years away, 2 days later the dot was gone. <br>
It's incredible, this sucker was big, for the Gamma rays to be as bright as <br>
they were this far away, it  must have been HUGE. I wouldn't want to be in <br>
the same Galaxy with a Gamma ray source of that intensity, even if it only <br>
lasted a minute. <br>
<p>
When matter and antimatter annihilate each other the photons of the gamma rays  <br>
produced have a specific amount of energy, the antimatter beam recently <br>
discovered in our Galaxy was discovered by Gamma rays made by anti electrons <br>
and electrons, in fact anti electrons is the only antimatter ever found in <br>
quantity outside the lab. The Gamma Ray Bursters don't fit the energy profile <br>
for electrons or any other known particle. These things make a supernova look <br>
like a cherry bomb, but what they are I have absolutely no idea. It's spooky.                                <br>
