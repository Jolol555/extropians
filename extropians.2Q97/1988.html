A photon polarized at 45 degrees encounters a polarizer set at 90 degrees. <br>
Only 2 things can happen, the photon can pass through the polarized <br>
completely unharmed or it can be stopped completely, modern Science has no <br>
way of predicting which will happen, the probability is exactly 50, 50. <br>
You could say there might be some cause that we just haven't found yet, <br>
but experimental results have proven that Bell's inequality is violated, <br>
so if there is such a cause it must be non local. A  non local "cause" would <br>
not weaken with distance, it could instantly change something on Earth even <br>
if the "cause" was 10 billion light years away and do so without changing <br>
anything between here and that distant location.  It would also mean that<br>
reverse causality is real, the reason of you just won a thousand dollars at <br>
the roulette table is a cause that has not happened yet and will not happen <br>
for a million years. A non local cause would be utterly bizarre, so different <br>
from our everyday meaning of "cause " that we'd really need to  invent a new <br>
word for it. <br>

Every time you drink a cup of coffee you remain you, even though your brain <br>
is changed FAR more that a little quantum uncertainty concerning the position  <br>
of some of your atoms.<br>
