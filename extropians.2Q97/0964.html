Clearly. And I think the discussions on this list is good evidence that<br>
there are many who desire this kind of technology. <br>

<p>
No, it is a fallacy which is surprisingly common. The oldest and most <br>
obvious counterexample is IMHO Samuel's checker program, which was <br>
significantly better than him. I'm constantly amazed (and dismayed) by <br>
what the neural networks I play with do, and sometimes they come up with <br>
obvious solutions to problems I did not think of. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; How far has self-learning computing progressed? </i><br>
<p>
Depends on what kind of learning you refer to. I don't know enough about <br>
classical AI, but EURISKO-style heuristic competition is quite similar to <br>
genetic algorithms, a field where there is plenty of exciting results. <br>
Neural networks learn fine, but we still have to find good input <br>
representations and architectures for them. <br>
