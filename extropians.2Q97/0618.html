I had the immense privilege tonight of attending a lecture by Max Perutz <br>
(Nobel Prize, chemistry) celebrating the life and accomplishments of <br>
Lise Meitner, whose work led to the discovery of nuclear fission.  It <br>
was refreshing to hear that this female genius was respected and <br>
esteemed by the top physicists and chemists, and the relevant <br>
obscurity of her career had more to do with the disruptions wrought <br>
by the two world wars.  <br>
<p>
A distinguished audience including friends of Perutz and prominent <br>
members of the scientific community gathered in the elegant main room <br>
of the Chancery of the Embassy of Austria.  Somehow the Library of <br>
Congress was persuaded to release their collection of books on <br>
Meitner for the evening. Accompanied by slides of historical photographs, <br>
Perutz provided both an historical overview and his own personal <br>
insights into that turbulent period of history as it was experienced by <br>
the great scientists of the era.  He described Lise as a woman who <br>
'combined a brilliant mind with a warm heart, compassion and a sense of <br>
humor.'  <br>
<p>
The stories he told reflected the quest for discovery and <br>
pure joy of pursuing the frontiers of the new sciences, and this <br>
positivity infected the audience.  Upon the announcement that an <br>
element discovered in 1982 has been named 'Meitnerium', a great round <br>
of applause broke out.  When we adjourned for chemical experiments <br>
involving wine, I was able to have a few words with Mr. Perutz, wherein <br>
I found him a friendly and upbeat person.  Many thanks to the <br>
Austrians for providing such an informative and entertaining evening.<br>
<p>
*A brief summary for those interested:*<br>
<p>
Lise Meitner was born into a Viennan Jewish family and was raised in <br>
an intellectual atmosphere.  Although official schooling for women <br>
ended at the age of 14, Lise obtained private lessons and eventually <br>
entered the Vienna University, where she studied under Boltzmann.  <br>
Moving on to Berlin, where she was to remain for 31 years, she <br>
attended Max Planck's memorable debates with the logical positivists <br>
who declared that atoms simply couldn't exist because they couldn't <br>
be seen.  In her first job, she was banned from the chemistry lab and <br>
had to set up working space in a woodshed, because women weren't <br>
allowed in the main lab!  This proved only a minor setback as her <br>
work progressed, and the discovery of X-rays led to exciting work in <br>
radioactivity experiments.  An hypothesis formulated by Lise, <br>
Frische (sic?) and proven by Hahn's experiments resulted in two papers <br>
that established fission as a reality and led to the infamous  <br>
memorandum to the British government detailing how to construct an <br>
atomic bomb.  <br>
<p>
During World War I, Lise worked as an X-ray nurse on the Eastern <br>
Front, the Italian front, and then the Russian front.  Upon her <br>
return to Berlin, she took a university position and began a lifelong <br>
collaboration with Otto Hahn.  Just prior to World War II, as the <br>
Nazi laws took effect, Lise was denounced by one of her younger <br>
colleagues.  Invitations for safe haven arrived from colleagues around <br>
the world, but she waited too long and became trapped in Berlin.  A <br>
group of Dutch physicists organized a complex rescue operation <br>
involving the Dutch border guards, and Lise fled into Holland with <br>
only two suitcases and ten marks.  Unable to find work in Holland, <br>
she left for Stockholm just in time to avoid the mass deportation of <br>
Jews.  Sadly, she remained stranded for many years in Stockholm <br>
without money, equipment, or trained assistants who spoke her <br>
language.  <br>
<p>
In 1962 she retired to Cambridge, where Max Perutz met her <br>
and later nominated her for the Ferme Prize.  She was awarded the Ferme <br>
Prize two years prior to her death.  Although nominated twice for the <br>
Nobel, she did not receive it, first due to confusion over which <br>
committee should judge her work, and secondly due to the immense <br>
communications problems during the WWII.  It is somewhat fitting that <br>
the Ferme Prize should be awarded to her, as Ferme used his own Nobel <br>
Prize money to secure escape to the U.S. for himself and his Jewish <br>
wife.<br>
