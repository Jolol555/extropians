Concluding their 1997 term, the Supreme Court Justices ruled 5-4 in<br>
favor of states rights proponents and against the Federal Brady Law.<br>
They ruled that federal law cannot commandeer the resources and time of<br>
state officials without compensation to administer the requirements of<br>
federal regulation. It is a usurpation of states 10th Amendment rights.<br>
<p>
The next legal challenge to the Brady Law will be on its effectiveness.<br>
There is a class action lawsuit brewing based on the findings of the<br>
GAO's report on the effectiveness of the Brady Law in deterring<br>
criminals from purchasing guns. Given the the government's own report<br>
found that tens of thousands of citizens legally entitled to purchase<br>
guns have been denied their rights due to faulty administration of the<br>
Brady requirements, and only 7 criminals have actually been prosecuted<br>
under the law, the suit seeks to have the court declare that the social<br>
benefits of the law are vastly outwieghed by the violations of citizens<br>
constitutional rights under the law. They have specific instances of<br>
citizens being denied the right to purchase handguns based on false or<br>
incorrectly applied information, who then went on to become victims of<br>
violent crime that they had been seeking to protect themselves from<br>
(typically battered women seeking to protect themselves from boyfreinds<br>
or husbands who have violated restraining orders).<br>
<p>
Given that state and local officials will no longer be administrating<br>
the law, the feds are now forced to move forward with the InstaCheck<br>
program, which is a nationwide database of criminals who are barred from<br>
purchasing guns. Up to now, the Clinton administration has been stalling<br>
the implementation of this program for political reasons, even though<br>
they had committed themselves to full implementation of it by 1998 under<br>
amendments to the Brady Bill that the NRA had pushed and the White House<br>
agreed to.<br>
<p>
What remains is that a watchdog organization be given oversight to the<br>
Instacheck program to ensure that this system is not used to collect<br>
information on the gun buying habits of law abiding citizens. Right now<br>
the instpector general and the GAO both share in this responsibility.<br>
Lets hope that this is not abused.<br>
