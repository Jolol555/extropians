&lt;My model applies to *any* situation where any two agents disagree <br>

<p>
I was going to ask, does "understanding what the claim means" imply an <br>
agreement on the prior probabilities involved in the problem <br>
statement, or just an agreement on what the terms of the debate are?<br>
(I thought, very simplistically I'm sure, that the essence of a <br>
Bayesian analysis was that you had these prior probabilities <br>
describing the likelihood of a particular outcome in some problem <br>
domain, *that everyone had to agree upon*, and THEN you try to come up <br>
with a new likelihood estimate, or decision between several options, <br>
given some additional evidence or arguments.)<br>
<p>
BUT, after rereading your abstract, it seems that you're really <br>
describing how to measure the average bias *between* competing <br>
evidence or arguments, that is, quantifying the level of disagreement, <br>
rather than trying to establish the likelihood of either one of the <br>
individual arguments being correct, or of making a choice between the <br>
two arguments.<br>
<p>
Again, this is all based just on your abstract and my VERY inadequate <br>
understanding of the subject, so thanks for your helpful response.<br>
