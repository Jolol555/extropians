THIS HAS SPOILERS FOR VERNOR VINGE'S NOVEL "A FIRE UPON THE DEEP".<br>
<p>
I was pleased to see Max mention a few weeks ago that Vernor Vinge is<br>
working on a book tentatively titled "A Deepness in the Sky".  I assume<br>
this is related to "A Fire Upon the Deep", which is one of my favorite<br>
SF novels.<br>
<p>
In re-reading AFUTD though I find that the parts I liked best were the<br>
high tech space adventures, the descriptions of future technology,<br>
and the usenet-style galactic newsgroup postings.  I didn't really<br>
care for the parts about the dog packs and their medieval plotting.<br>
So it will be interesting to see what direction he goes with the new book.<br>
<p>
One thing I didn't like about the ending to AFUTD is that it seemed so<br>
destructive.  Readers will recall that the Countermeasure, activated by<br>
the "godshatter" within Pham Nuwen, has altered the boundaries of the<br>
zones of thought, pushing the Slow Zone up into what used to be the<br>
Transcend.  This effectivelly killed the Blight since it could not<br>
live within such conditions.<br>
<p>
However, this also will wreak terrible destruction on the other<br>
civilizations in that part of the galaxy, which have become dependent on<br>
FTL communication and transportation, and possibly other technologies<br>
that won't work in the Slow Zone.  As Vinge has a character say,<br>
"In some ways the Revenge was a worse thing than the Blight itself."<br>
Truly this is burning down the village in order to save it.<br>
<p>
When I read the book the first time I had the impression that the<br>
extension of the Slow Zone occured throughout the galaxy.  Sandor at<br>
the Zoo, a tough and smart newsgroup poster, had speculated that the<br>
previous incarnation of the Blight and its subsequent destruction marked<br>
the beginning of recorded history.  This would presumably have been a<br>
galaxy wide event, otherwise the unaffected regions would no doubt have<br>
passed down some legends about such a dramatic occurance.<br>
<p>
Actually Vinge leaves the magnitude of the Zone changes somewhat ambiguous.<br>
Ravna's instruments indicate that Tines World, at the former bottom of the<br>
Beyond, is now 1,000 to 30,000 ly deep within the Slow Zone.  The Beyond<br>
was about 5,000 ly deep, so this would be consistent with the Slow Zone<br>
extending far into the Transcend.<br>
<p>
The last item in the book is a news posting from the "Society for<br>
Rational Investigation" saying that they are getting no response from<br>
sites to spinward.  Apparently they are right on the edge of the extended<br>
Slow Zone.  They are also getting no response from sites in the Transcend<br>
above the affected region, confirming that the Slow Zone does in fact<br>
extend high enough to engulf the Powers up there.<br>
<p>
So, the Slow Zone extends high, but how wide is the affected region?  I did<br>
a bit of detective work to get some information.  The Society for Rational<br>
Investigation is mentioned a couple of times earlier, and its location is<br>
given.  Unfortunately two different numbers are used in my edition.  In<br>
chapter 18 it is described as "Probably a single system in Middle Beyond,<br>
5700 light-years antispinward of Sjandra Kei."  In chapter 40 the same<br>
description is used, except the distance is 7500 ly antispinward.  So it<br>
is around 5700-7500 ly antispinward of Sjandra Kei.  Sjandra Kei is itself<br>
about 1500 ly spinward of Tines World, putting SRI about 4000-6000 ly<br>
antispinward of them.<br>
<p>
If we assume that the Zone disturbance is roughly symmetrical around Tines<br>
World, then this suggests that the affected region is about 10,000 ly wide,<br>
extending maybe 10,000 ly out, to include all of the inhabited part of the<br>
Transcend above Tines World, and hopefully including all the area which<br>
had been grabbed by the Blight.<br>
<p>
I tried to get some information about how wide the Blight's region was.<br>
A few High Beyond civilizations are described as under its control.<br>
One way to judge how far these are away is by looking at the language<br>
translation paths.  They all end up as Triskweline, apparently a widely<br>
used language in that part of the galaxy.<br>
<p>
Arbitration Arts is the first High Beyond civilization conquered.<br>
Their messages are translated as Firetongue-&gt;Cloudmark-&gt;Triskweline.<br>
However the first two are High Beyond trade languages apparently capable<br>
of carrying high level protocol packets, something like an advanced<br>
version of Java applets.  The Blight uses these to subvert Arbitration<br>
Arts, and after that nobody uses the High Beyond languages any more,<br>
they stick to the Middle Beyond ones.  So basically this civilization is<br>
going directly to Triskweline, suggesting it is close by.  Similarly,<br>
Sandor Arbitration Intelligence at the Zoo is another powerful High<br>
Beyond "military corporation" which gets taken over by the Blight.<br>
Their messages are directly in Triskweline, with no translation, again<br>
suggesting that they are located roughly "above" Tines World.<br>
<p>
All this is consistent with the Blight's range still being relatively<br>
limited (on the galactic scale) at the time that the Countermeasure<br>
was activated, so that even though the Zone disturbance was relatively<br>
localized, it is reasonable to assume that all of the Blight was in<br>
fact engulfed.  That's good.  There is so much death and destruction in<br>
the novel that it would be a real tragedy if it had failed to accomplish<br>
its purpose.<br>
<p>
The remaining puzzle then is why the destruction of the Blight this time<br>
is seemingly less harmful to the galaxy as a whole than the previous<br>
incarnation.  Throughout the novel there is no hint that anyone remembers<br>
any earlier instance of the Blight.  My guess is that in fact the previous<br>
time the Blight was activated, its destruction required a far more<br>
powerful defense.  Perhaps it spread much faster before a Countermeasure<br>
could be found and activated.  After all, it was a near enough thing<br>
this time.  Yet by Sandor's speculations, the Countermeasure would have<br>
been widely distributed throughout the galaxy to be ready if and when<br>
the Blight is activated again.  So even if this particular instance had<br>
been destroyed, assuming the Low Beyond remains relatively free from the<br>
Blight's control (perhaps something like Vichy France), someone might<br>
eventually stumble on the Countermeasure and find out how to activate it,<br>
or perhaps something the Blight would do would eventually trigger it.<br>
<p>
We might assume that the activation of the Countermeasure in the novel<br>
was finely tuned by the godshatter so that it would do no more damage<br>
than was necessary.  Since the Blight was being destroyed relatively<br>
early in its spread, only a limited shift of the Zonal boundaries would<br>
be enough to eradicate it.<br>
<p>
What this theory suggests then is that at some point in the past, the<br>
Slow Zone was extended into the Transcend on a nearly galaxy-wide basis<br>
in order to destroy a Blight which had conquered the galaxy, controlled<br>
the Upper Beyond absolutely, and through agents had a great deal of<br>
control over the rest of the Beyond.  The Countermeasure was activated,<br>
the Zonal boundaries extended, and ever since then they have been receding<br>
until they are at the size observed "today".<br>
<p>
One problem with this is that the Zones are said to be shrinking at<br>
710 m/s.  This is about 2000 ly per billion years.  So if the Slow Zone<br>
was pushed out beyond the Transcend, it would need to shrink more like<br>
10,000 ly to be back to where it is today, requiring 5 billion years.<br>
But this is much longer than their history seems to go back.  Possibly the<br>
surge is more temporary, shrinking back at a much faster rate initially,<br>
then slowing down as the Zones approach their "natural" states.  In that<br>
case the previous incarnation of the Blight might have happened only a<br>
billion or two years ago.<br>
<p>
Hope you enjoy this bit of speculation -<br>
<p>
