<i>&gt;	Since most religions are founded on the teachings of mystics, the</i><br>

<i>&gt;moves on and the control-oriented people take over.</i><br>
<i>&gt;	If the mystical experience is "part of our natural cognitive state", then</i><br>

<i>&gt;especially considering the obvious "reprogramming" that seems to occur with</i><br>

<p>
Yes, we need to explore the experience more fully; that's what I'm<br>
saying.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Believe me, there is *nothing* like that experience; even</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;  psychedelics give merely a weedy little echo of the 'cosmicness' of</i><br>
<i>&gt;it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;  And I think that sentient beings who *lived* from that perspective</i><br>
<i>&gt;could</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;  be immensely powerful and joyful creatures.  Easily able to re-program</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;  themselves, to morph, etc. - in fact, Transhuman!)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	"Believe me, there is nothing like that experience;..."  ...Of course; but</i><br>
<i>&gt;that can be said of many expeiences, can it not?</i><br>
<p>
It can be said of *every* experience, depending on the 'grain' of one's<br>
experience.  But there are experiences and experiences, there are stars<br>
and then there are STARS.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;	"...immensely powerful..."...When the need for power disappears, then all</i><br>
<i>&gt;power is realized, right?   Isn't the striving for power an indication of</i><br>
<i>&gt;fear and the need to control?</i><br>
<p>
The dog barks, the flower grows.  Power is a natural expression - every<br>
entity that exists is trying to "remake reality closer to the heart's<br>
desire".  It simply canot be avoided.  From one point of view life is<br>
just a game, with winners and losers.  If there is no game, then<br>
everything is the same.  That is the desired goal for the suffering one,<br>
but the sorted one realises that the intrinsic sameness of things is<br>
boring, and magically creates goals, possibilities that call to be<br>
realised, and that, when realised, will temporarily upset the 'balance',<br>
whatever it was.  The Dance.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; but your so called 'mystics' have found meditation does it also. Also</i><br>
<i>&gt;exercise seems to help and mindless simple things like shaving...</i><br>
<i>&gt;driving....</i><br>
<i>&gt;This process helps with creativity also. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	It appears that creativity can be accessed when one gets out of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;critical, judgemental state of mind.  This is referred to as "being in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;space".  This can be accomplished by remaining focused on "the point of</i><br>
<i>&gt;concentration".  The mindless activities, you mention, are ways of dropping</i><br>
<i>&gt;the critical, judgemental state of mind.and leaving oneself open to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;creative process.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Agreed, but that has nothing to do with ego loss per se.  The Buddhists<br>
distinguish between Shamatha, tranquility, lucidity, 'emptiness' in the<br>
sense of silence, not much going on, on the one hand, and Vipashyana,<br>
insight, 'getting it'.  The thing about the mystical is that it isn't<br>
just a state of relative calm and peacefulness or just plain absence of<br>
being bothered by thoughts or the ego, it is literally *seeing through*<br>
the ego, seeing it for what it is, actually grasping as a fact that it<br>
is empty of intrinsic identity, identifiability or reality.<br>
