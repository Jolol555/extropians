I read this article.  This number is pretty completely bogus.  They went<br>
through the literature and found about 60 studies that estimated the value<br>
of various ecosystem services (flood control, CO2 recycling, etc) provided<br>
by various types of ecosystem (ocean, reef, wetland, grassland etc).  Then<br>
they added them all up.  So far so good.  What makes it bogus is that some<br>
of the prices were marginal prices and some were replacement costs.  These<br>
are only the same if unit cost is independent of supply, which they<br>
explicitly point out in their article is not true.<br>
<p>
If the value of ecosystem services could be estimated accurately, the<br>
government be able to charge people for destroying ecosystems (or reward<br>
people for fixing them).  Such charges would make the world a better place.<br>
Unfortunately, this would only apply if the costs are estimated<br>
*accurately*, which I doubt is possible.  If costs could be estimated<br>
accurately by governments, socialism would be a thriving system.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Global GNP is around US$18 trillion/yr.</i><br>
<p>
Hey!  If we triple GNP, we'll be able to get rid of Nature entirely!<br>

<i>&gt;"Although it is possible to imagine generating</i><br>
<i>&gt;human welfare without natural capital and ecosystem</i><br>

<i>&gt;too remote and unlikely to be of much current</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest. In fact, one additional way to think</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the value of ecosystem services is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dteermine what it would cost to replicate them</i><br>
<i>&gt;in a technologically produced, artificial</i><br>
<i>&gt;biosphere.</i><br>
<i>&gt;No figures are provided in support of these </i><br>
<i>&gt;claims about space-colony economics.</i><br>
<p>
I estimated the cost of sustaining someone in Biosphere II to be about<br>
$200,000/yr in direct consumption and several times that in depreciation.  I<br>
don't have the email message with the details on this estimate any more but<br>
I think it was to this list, so you could maybe find it in the archive.<br>
<p>
Of course, Biosphere II is the first try, and new technologies always get<br>
cheaper.  I doubt they'll get cheap enough to move the whole human race into<br>
biospheres any time soon, though. <br>
