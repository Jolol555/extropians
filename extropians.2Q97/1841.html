<i>        &gt;intelligence doesn't really produce consciousness.     </i><br>
    <br>
<p>
You're free to believe me or not, but I know for a fact that I'm conscious, <br>
I also know that Evolution produced me, and I know that Evolution is only <br>
interested in results, in behavior, so it's easy to see why it came up with <br>
intelligence, but there is a mystery here. Why am I conscious?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I'm sure some animals and insects aren't conscious like we are.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I still don't understand why you say "conscious like we are" instead of <br>
"conscious like I am". Anyway, you think insects aren't very conscious, <br>
I agree because they don't act very intelligent, but if you're correct and  <br>
behavior tells you nothing about consciousness then there is no reason they <br>
couldn't be conscious, rocks too for that matter, or a cadaver.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;There are machines now that can pass, at least limited, Turring         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;tests.           </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Limited Turing Tests are a mockery, they insult Turing's original idea.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Soon they will be completely unlimited and in distinguishable.          </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
If so then soon they will be completely conscious.<br>
              <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What would you think of these computers when they try to answer the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;question: "What is blue like?"  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
They probably couldn't give a very good answer to that question, but then, <br>
I can't either.<br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;My present consciousness was also influenced by the experiences I        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;had in my life up to now, and every bit of it came to me through my        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;senses and they can be represented digitally also.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;No.           </i><br>
        <br>
No!? What do you mean "No"? The image you're looking at this instant is a  <br>
digital one created by your computer, when you listen to a CD it is a digital  <br>
sound. Does your entire argument hinge on the impossibility of doing the<br>
same  thing with smell, taste and touch?<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We know that neural firing is not physically anything like light         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reflecting off of a surface.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
True, and we know that the digital electrical signal produced by  a CCD  <br>
television camera is not physically anything like light reflecting off of a  <br>
surface, and we know that neural firing is not physically anything like the  <br>
quale of seeing a color. In other words, the physical nature of the objects <br>
processing the information, neurons or transistors, has no effect on the <br>
subjective experience.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;We simply abstractly know that if we feel a red sensation then 700nm         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;light is being reflected. Knowing this doesn't imply that the two         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;phenomenon are anything like each other. The actual nature of the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;red quale, or what it is like, did not come to you through your        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;senses.  Your brain simply used these phenomenal qualities to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;represent the abstract information it was getting about the world.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That is certainly true, we have no idea what the ultimate reality is, but I <br>
don't see how that helps your argument that only meat can be conscious.         <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;The important thing is the way the matter is organized and the name        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;for that is information.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;But there is more than just this!          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
What is the difference between you and me? You agree that one atom is <br>
identical to another so that can't be it, if it's not the way those atoms are <br>
organized either then the holly rollers must be right and we have a <br>
traditional religious soul. If I thought that I'd throw away my science books  <br>
and buy a saffron robe.                        <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I know that the sensation I get from looking at a fire red mustang         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;is very different from what I experience  when I try to remember that         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;red.  With my eyes closed I can't normally experience this red        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;sensation, unless I am dreaming.  I know the difference between         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;these two representations and I did not find out this difference        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;information from my senses.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Of course you used your senses, otherwise you wouldn't know what red "looked" <br>
like in the first place and so discover that your color memory is faulty.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Some day you will be able to configure a part of your brain to        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;reproduce the same conscious phenomenon that is going on in my brain        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;because of our scientific physical understanding of the processes         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that we will discover. You will then know precisely what it is like         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;for me to experience something.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Then "I" will know precisely  what it is like for part of my brain to be <br>
configured like part of your brain. "I" would still not know what it's like  <br>
to be you unless the part grew until it included the entire brain, and even  <br>
then "I" wouldn't know because "I" would no longer exist.<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;if you use different stuff to represent or model the same         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;information or process, though it may abstractly model you, it will         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;be fundamentally different and distinguishable from you.          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
At one time programs were run on computers made with vacuum tubes, modern  <br>
machines use different stuff, would the results be fundamentally different  <br>
and distinguishable if those old programs were run on a semiconductor machine?<br>
          <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The information is important but the nature of the particular stuff         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;and what it is like is also important for consciousness.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Even if true, which I very much doubt, the nature of the particular stuff can <br>
be expressed, in fact can only be expressed, as information.<br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt; Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt; 1) The soul can't be duplicated but information can be.  </i><br>
          <br>
<i>        &gt;I would completely disagree with this.  What is there about the soul         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;that can't be duplicated given the proper ability to manipulate         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;physical stuff into the proper operating state?</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
My idea of the soul, information, can certainly be duplicated, I was <br>
referring to the traditional religious soul in the above.<br>
           <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt; 2) The soul is and will always remain unfathomable,</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;What a depressing thought. </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
Agreed, it's one of the two main reasons religion is so depressing, the other <br>
being a loving God who will torture you not for a billion years, but for <br>
eternity for the slightest infraction of his many rules. <br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>         &gt;Why would you think this?  I see no evidence that points to this.          </i><br>
         <br>
<p>
You can't ask for logic or evidence here, this is religion, it's not supposed <br>
to make any sense. <br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;but even if the soul exists it will never be proven.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Why would you say this?          </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Because according to the religious even trying to understand the mechanism of  <br>
the soul is blasphemous and the less logical a belief you have faith in is,  <br>
the greater your virtue.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;You can put on colored glasses which will invert the qualia you use         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;to represent particular wavelengths of light.  (Or you might invert         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the color wiring between your retina and the primary visual cortex)         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;What you once called blue might become red and what was once red        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;might become blue.  You will act the same, but you subjective  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;experience or the way you represent the visual world will be very        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;different. </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
You say right at the beginning that you invert the qualia, if so then of <br>
course, if you change the qualia then the qualia is changed, and my behavior <br>
would change too, I'd be complaining about the weird red sky. If you bolted <br>
on these glasses at my birth then my behavior would not change and it's far <br>
from clear to me that my subjective experience would be  different than what <br>
it is now, and if you suddenly took off my colored glasses I would be <br>
completely disorientated.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;A machine can represent joy/desire and behave as if it is         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;experiencing joy/desire, but it can't, YET, really know what         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;joy/desire is like.</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
Just out of curiosity, why do you think it's easier to build an intelligent <br>
machine than a conscious one? Considering Evolution's experience in building  <br>
such things, you could make a much stronger case that a computer might be  <br>
able to feel emotions but it could never be intelligent.<br>
<p>
Nature found it much easier to come up with feeling than the ability to  <br>
reason, it's certainly came up with it first. The most ancient part of the  <br>
brain, the spinal cord, the medulla and the pons is similar to the brain of  <br>
a fish or amphibian and first made an appearance on the earth about  400 <br>
million years ago. According to Paul MacLean of the National Institute of<br>
Mental Health it deals in aggressive behavior, territoriality  and social  <br>
hierarchies. <br>
<p>
The Limbic System is about 150 million years old and ours is similar to that  <br>
found in other mammals. Some think the Limbic system is the source of awe and  <br>
exhilaration because it is the active sight of many psychotropic drugs,  <br>
there's little doubt that the amygdala, a part of the Limbic system has much  <br>
to do with fear. After some animals developed a Limbic system they started to  <br>
spend much more time taking care of their young, so it probably has something  <br>
to do with love too. <br>
<p>
It is our grossly enlarged neocortex that makes the human brain so unusual  <br>
and so recent, it only started to get ridiculously large about 3 million  <br>
years ago. It deals in deliberation, spatial perception, speaking, reading,  <br>
writing and mathematics, the one new emotion we got was worry, probably  <br>
because the neocortex is also the place where we plan for the future.     <br>
<p>
If nature came up with feeling first and high level intelligence much later,  <br>
I don't see  why the opposite would be true for our computers. It's probably <br>
a hell of a  lot easier to make something that feels but doesn't think than <br>
something that thinks but doesn't feel.                    <br>
                                             <br>
