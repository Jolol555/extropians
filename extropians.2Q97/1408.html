<i>&gt; The Borg saga has taken a new twist with the season finale of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Star Trek Voyager series, in which the Borg encounter a species with</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely dense DNA that overwhelms their attempts at assimilation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Voyager crew is faced with making their way through Borg space</i><br>
<i>&gt; and try to cut a deal with the Borg after they develop what they</i><br>
<i>&gt; think is a method of fighting the biological hordes utilizing Borg</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology.  There is an excellent explanation of Borg assimilation</i><br>
<i>&gt; technique, as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, we won't find out what happens for several months, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is interesting to see a storyline developed between two possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; modes of projected evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Its interesting that the story implied that this new species are<br>
ferocious fighters who live by an extremely Darwinian credo: "And the<br>
weak shall perish." This would explain why their military technologies<br>
have reached such a high level that they can take on and wipe out a Borg<br>
Armada of 15 cubes with ease. That they originate from a thin stream of<br>
space that is awash in "gravi-temporal disturbances" would imply the<br>
possibility that they are an extremely advanced species from the far<br>
future (which would explain the dense DNA, which would resist rediation<br>
better than ours does) possibly near the opemga point. Their extreme<br>
level of evolvement, and DNA radiation resistance together point to<br>
this. <br>
<p>
Working with the Borg serves a useful strategic interest, not only of<br>
the Voyager, but of the Federation. The Borg are apparently the only<br>
thing impeding this new species advancement into Federation space. If<br>
you help the Borg fight the new species, they will 1) be less likely to<br>
flee into Federation space, and 2)be more occupied with fighting the new<br>
species than in fleeing, thus slowing the Borg expansion into Federation<br>
space.<br>
<p>
Another possibility is that this conflict is what caused the Borg to<br>
become borganized. This may have happened as a desperate response to<br>
this overwhelming threat. What they do to other species is seen in the<br>
collective as of utmost importance as it is supporting the "defense<br>
effort" against this alien species.<br>
