     "For those who think society is in an inevitable decline: The FBI just <br>
     released their crime figures (no, not crimes *by* the FBI--those they <br>
     don't reveal!). Violent crime dropped for the fifth year in a row in <br>
     the USA, this time by 7%. This includes an 11% decline in murders <br>
     (16.5% decline here in LA).<br>
     <br>
     Of course, government agencies want to take the credit, though it's <br>
     really not clear why this downward trend is happening. The LA Times <br>
     story speculating that it's because the baby boomers are aging and <br>
     there are fewer young people (who mostly commit the violent crimes). <br>
     This may contribute, though I find it doubtful that this alone would <br>
     result in such a rapid decline in violent crime."<br>
     <br>
     My response: <br>
     <br>
     I've been following the same news thread/statistics and I wonder too <br>
     what is promoting a trend towards people becoming less violent.  The <br>
     future I imagine won't have people clamoring for the almighty dollar, <br>
     honestly or with a gun (or briefcase in the case of white collar <br>
     crime..hats off to Don Henley for that observation).  <br>
     <br>
     A few observations of my own:<br>
     <br>
     * crimes of passion--are we finally getting it that our culture is one <br>
     of serial monogamists at best?  The rather "constipated" way we have <br>
     regarded our intimate partners as possessions may be what triggers <br>
     irrational explosions of violence when the status quo of a <br>
     "relationship" is upset.  I can see the logic for adultery being <br>
     something to discourage in more primitive societies where women were <br>
     objects of trade and ownership but this century has been the first to <br>
     see women de-objectified.<br>
     <br>
     * Is it more (or better, psychologically and technologically advanced) <br>
     law enforcement or better distractions for the respective classes?  <br>
     Speculation abounds that the government keeps the poorer classes well <br>
     anesthetized (drugs/alcohol) and the middle class seems to be content <br>
     as long as we get our toys and entertainment fed to us without fail.  <br>
     I've often maintained that TV is the best heroin value for the money <br>
     &lt;G&gt;.<br>
     <br>
     * Information economy--Could it be that our information-rich economy <br>
     is able to stand on its feet?  Can we capably provide more people with <br>
     better or more interesting (or simpler) jobs so that they can spend <br>
     less time in angst about how much their lives suck and actually think <br>
     about how they may want to express themselves/contribute (the analogy <br>
     drawn from when agriculture released people from the day-to-day <br>
     survival game, some were actually able to start contemplating their <br>
     environment and the first sciences and religions could emerge)?<br>
     <br>
     What motivates crime?  I'm the personality type that likes to slot <br>
     things snugly rather than consider a more dynamic motif.  Is crime <br>
     motivated fundamentally by (somewhat outdated) survival issues (I want <br>
     what you have, I resent what you have, I hate you for it, I'll <br>
     kill/hurt you for taking what I have)?  In a society of such <br>
     abundance, should crime based on survival issues not already be <br>
     antiquated?  Is our culture a luxury liner or a lifeboat?  Who has to <br>
     do what to participate?  What happens to them if they don't?  Some <br>
     resort to violent crime and some give up and become the <br>
     disenfranchised reminders of what still must be addressed as we take <br>
     aim at a more evolved society.<br>
     <br>
     Just some thoughts.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
