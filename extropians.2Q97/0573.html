In a message dated 97-04-23 04:33:46 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Apparently your idea of "too simplistic" is "says something meaningful</i><br>
<i>&gt;  clearly enough to be understood."  The actual content of the statement,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  that public education costs twice as much as private education of better</i><br>
<i>&gt;  quality, you evade altogether so you can react to my choice of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  word "stolen" to describe taxes.  Fine, substitute "taken"--a simple</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fact of reality you can't evade--and then deal with the actual content</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of the assertion, which I stand by.  I also happily stand my my use of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the word "stolen", but if that gets in the way of your ability to apply</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ordinary reason to an assertion, then go ahead and pick a less loaded</i><br>
<i>&gt;  word for your own use.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
No I do not have a problem with your assertion of education being badly<br>
managed by the government. Or of taxation being unfair.<br>
The MAJOR difference - which you appanrently missed - is pointing out that<br>
SOME people, not you.. not Mr. Lorrey, not most Libertarians, but this one..<br>
see value in educating people who have no money. In making education<br>
available at OUR OWN EXPENSE to others who have  children but may ( for some<br>
stupid reason) think their children don;t deserve it. I said this is my own<br>
SELFISH desire for a better society. <br>
I would gladly pay a part of my salary to educate your kid, if you were<br>
stupid enough to want him to NOT go to school - or if you were a poor<br>
provider. I want public education to survive, even if I do ( and I do ) have<br>
my kids in private schools.  Even if that "public" education is privately<br>
funded.<br>
<p>
<p>
This came in before I unsubsribed, but will not be on list so you may reply<br>
offlist if you like.<br>
