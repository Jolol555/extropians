Sorry, but I can't let you off so easily.<br>
<p>
1) Legislators and their staffs are paid from funds which are coerced by <br>
the taxpayers.  So the very act of legislating, as it is currently <br>
practiced in most locations, has everything to do with coercion and would <br>
be impossible _without_ coercion.  (Obviously this does does not include <br>
legislators who work for free, or who are funded [legally] from other <br>
non-coercive sources, but I'm not aware that such people exist.)<br>
<p>
2) In the United States, the Executive branch is prohibited  by the <br>
Constitution from making laws.  Therefore, if legislators didn't write <br>
laws, bureaucrats wouldn't have regulations to enforce.  So again, <br>
legislators play a crucial role in the coercive cycle of politics.<br>
