     Rick Knight commented:<br>
     <br>
     It does occur for me that amongst the many contributors to this list, <br>
     there is a preference for those things most proveable, tangible and <br>
     material rather than anything etherial, supposed, or otherwise <br>
     imagined. <br>
     <br>
     Mark Grant replied:<br>
     <br>
     Personally I want to achieve a variety of tangible things; the only<br>
     reliable way of doing that is to concentrate on the tangible, provable <br>
     and material aspects of life. I've met zillions of people who dream <br>
     about and talk about achieving many things, but few who actually do <br>
     anything about it. The latter folks have a high success rate, the <br>
     former almost zero. <br>
     <br>
     Rick responds:<br>
     <br>
     Action is the only logical way to get things done.  I only advocate <br>
     balance between the realm of dreaming/imagining/intention-ing and <br>
     acting on those intentions.  And I'd imagine that *zillions* was a <br>
     metaphor &lt;G&gt;.  <br>
