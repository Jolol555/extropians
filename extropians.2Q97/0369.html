        The following poem just got rave reviews by my friend Wade<br>
Cherrington today.  I'd like to hear what others think...<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Delusions Of Grandeur<br>
<p>
<p>
Welcome to the afterlife: a place of false surreality,<br>
Where window-paine Charlemagnes bask in superficiality.<br>
Meet the men who would live your life, the men who want to sell your soul,<br>
The men of mercy, the men of faith, the men who just want control.<br>
Welcome to your private Hell, reminding you of the thoughts unmade,<br>
The heart of virtue, the core of fear where you take a promenade.<br>
The idleness of vanity will lead to cold insanity,<br>
A picture of confidence for the goodness of humanity.<br>
Meet the men who would steal your faith and make you a catastrophe,<br>
The men who'd love to suck you dry and watch the coming atrophy.<br>
Welcome to the place where you give up and give in to disrespect,<br>
A world where you must earn your pain and circumstantial retrospect.<br>
Meet the men who would take your heart and drain it of the blood it wields,<br>
The men who abhor reason and the concept the ideal yields.<br>
Meet the one who would flush his world because he could not dare be true,<br>
Welcome to the afterlife: the previous life is overdue.<br>
