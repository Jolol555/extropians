In an anarcho-capitalistic society, what else is there besides private<br>
areas and "common areas of a private contractually based community"?<br>
Assuming all land is owned by someone, and all law is by private<br>
contract, all laws regarding display of nudity would also be by<br>
private contract.<br>
<p>
I would predict that in most common areas, nudity would be illegal.<br>
As Perry indicated, most people find it tasteless, and it is an<br>
especialy easy to define and enforce tasteless behavior in this area.<br>
That is, most people are willing to pay more to have nudity go away<br>
than the potential nudists are willing to pay to parade around nude.<br>
<p>
I would also predict widespread exceptions, accessible from most<br>
locations, where common nudity is legal.  <br>
