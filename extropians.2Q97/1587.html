I'm not entirely sure this discussion belongs on this, so, folks, yell at me<br>
(via email of course) if appropriate.<br>

<i>&gt;First a pet peeve:</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;1. Apes are not monkeys</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2. Monkeys are not apes</i><br>
<p>
<p>
And, by the same definition, humans aren't apes.  But these definitions are<br>
pretty arbitrary.  Apes certainly fall entirely within the monkey family, and<br>
we fall within that of the apes.  In other words, apes are closer to some<br>
monkeys than other monkeys are.  So calling an ape (or a human) a monkey<br>
isn't really inaccurate, although there are valid reasons for drawing a<br>
distinction. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Let me throw out a few benchmarks. Homo and Pan (chimpanzees) shared</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;parents around 14 million years back (immunological  and fossil</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;evidence). </i><br>
<p>
All this timing business remain unsettled.  Conventional wisdom today,<br>
however, says that humans and chimps shared a common ancestor only 3 million<br>
years ago.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Canus Lupus appears to be the first victim of</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;domestication, which, as Eric Watt Forste points out is not always a</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;good thing for the domesticee.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Well, perhaps not for the individual (depending on your definition).<br>
 Domestication, however, is a spectacular success for the species.  There's a<br>
lot more dogs than wolves today, and with some species (cats and sheep) the<br>
ancestor species is nearly extinct.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;The preponderance of  evidence is that H. Sapiens and H. Neanderthalis</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;are not distinct species making the correct names H. Sapiens Sapiens</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(cro-magnon) and H. Sapiens Neanderthalis. Using the biological</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;definition of species (progeny of members of the set are able to</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;procreate, contrast donkeys and horses produce offspring, a mule that is</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;sterile). </i><br>
<p>
The preponderance of evidence vis-a-vis that is simply missing.  We don't<br>
have any Neanderthals to crossbreed with humans, so who knows if we could.<br>
 For all we know, they might have had 48 chromosomes like other apes rather<br>
than our 46 and crossbreeding would be quite out of the question.<br>
<p>
Typical Neanderthals fell well outside of modern human norms in several<br>
respects.  There larynxes were different and they probably couldn't speak as<br>
well as us.  They had enormous nasal passages.  Their arms were put together<br>
slightly differently and they would have been about twice as strong as us<br>
(much as with the apes).  Conventional wisdom today is that they were<br>
separate species both descended from Homo Heidelbergensis (sp?).  This is<br>
pretty tentative conventional wisdom, though.<br>
<p>
Speciation is a little more complicated than you put it.  There's also<br>
species that could interbreed but don't, e.g., all the big cats.<br>
 Homo/Neanderthal could have been that, too.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We are not significantly advanced from Neanderthals</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;(biologically).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Not more advanced, but somewhat different.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Domestication does not always result in species. </i><br>
<p>
I don't think it ever has, to date.  It could, if you bred the species for<br>
differing sexual behaviour or genitalia.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Monkeys are small, cheap and terrably limited in their abilities, </i><br>
<p>
Not *that* limited.  Quite capable of caretaking or machine operation, at<br>
least in theory. Some mental abilities seem limited to apes, and some only to<br>
humans.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;great apes (orangutans, gorillas, chimps) are very delicate, expensive</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;and rare creatures. </i><br>
<p>
Expensive, yes.  Rare, yes (although if they were successfully domesticated<br>
they'd become very common, like dogs, cats, parakeets, horses, etc)<br>
 Delicate?  No more than any other large animal.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There is a surplus of available human labor.</i><br>
<p>
Really?  Could you give me some?  I never have enough.<br>
