Creatine:  Creatine is a nutrient found in our bodies, and made from a<br>
combination of three amino acids:  arginine, glycine and methionine.<br>
Creatine helps provide energy for muscle growth.  When muscles contract, the<br>
fuel power is called ATP, adenosine triphosphate.  We need to rev-up the ATP<br>
supply to make muscles.  To produce more ATP, creatine phosphate can be<br>
taken as a supplement.  Creatine also helps to make proteins within the<br>
muscle fibers.<br>
<p>
Loading:  Loading means to divide the creatine supplement into phases.  By<br>
loading, we build up the muscle fibers' storage supply. Do this for a week<br>
(or so) and then reduce intake.  There are different loading methods, and I<br>
would suggest that you read about it on the Internet.  You will also have to<br>
experiment for yourself. There is a really clear and easy to understand<br>
loading table in Ray Sahelian's book _Creatine_ (you can find it on the<br>
Internet.)<br>
<p>
Each person is different, and each body builder will respond differently to<br>
loading phases.  I had to keep my grams small because of nausea.  There is a<br>
new supplement out that combines protein a creatine that I plan to purchase<br>
quite soon.  This product, produced by "Pinnacle" has the creatine mixed<br>
into it, so one doesn't have to dissolve the creatine in boiling water and<br>
drink it this way.<br>
