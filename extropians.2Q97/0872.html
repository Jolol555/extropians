routing in the low transcend<br>
<p>
Risking Anders' axe-swinging berserkergang, I hazard to<br>
(briefly) venture into his private domain: Jupiter Brains.<br>
(Since my current shell account at the Leibniz-local Sun<br>
cluster can only lynx, AmiTCP is still not installed, and<br>
I don't like imposing large binaries/high-overhead<br>
applications on a decade-old hardware with just 7-odd MHZ,<br>
7 MB RAM, no virtual memory and a 120 MByte SCSI drive, and<br>
the new 64 MByte/K6/Chaintech/Matrox Millenium/L4 Linux box<br>
is getting delayed, and delayed and delayed, I never can<br>
browse on the great Aleph server too much) &lt;/apology&gt;. So:<br>
<p>
How much bang can we squeeze from _conventional_ lunatic fringe<br>
tech -- no spacetime engineering, no femtotechnology -- plain<br>
old-fashioned stellar-scale autoreplicating molecular circuitry<br>
clusters, lazily swinging themselves around their own gravity<br>
centers, or solar-sailing fleet of line-of-sight laser-linked<br>
hardware boxes, on light-minute wide (lest their circuitry fry<br>
to black crisp in solproximal infernal heat) stellar orbits?<br>
<p>
We already know the outer limits of it, as defined by the<br>
Bekenstein bound. Actual constraints are much more pronounced,<br>
however. Using excited states of organic molecules for doing<br>
logics, obviously limits switching speeds to bond dissotiation<br>
energies (twirling dipoles emit/absorb EM radiation, and<br>
electron density is changed at excitation, geometry as well).<br>
Much lower, even, since thermal vibration will destroy the<br>
circuitry (I think defect introduction rate vs. temperature<br>
will be markedly nonlinear, showing a catastrophic threshold<br>
at few hundred K), and operating many switches at high<br>
frequencies at extremely high integration densities achievable<br>
by three-dimensional macromolecular crystals (I don't think<br>
the respite, if any, granted by reversible logics will amount<br>
to much), will dissipate a lot of heat.<br>
<p>
Best implementation for these would be fractal cooling fluid<br>
channels with integrated pumps, in a solid diamond matrix,<br>
encasing, and containing the hyperactively wiggly molecular<br>
switches. Notice that by engineering excited state species -<br>
containing cavities we can control their lifetimes, energy<br>
level spacing, and, most importantly, relaxation trajectories.<br>
However, I am still unsure whether drextech (aka machine-phase<br>
chemistry) is actually viable outside of post-cyberpunk SF<br>
novels, in the real world.<br>
<p>
Now autoassembly of linear polymers - macromolecular cluster<br>
complexes, initially going through a solvated, wet stage,<br>
automagically crosslinking to dry, relatively rigid macroscopic<br>
circuitry crystals, instantly inflates the atomic cell edge by<br>
at least one of order of magnitude, dropping integration density<br>
by three. Due to matrix bloating, necessary for kinetical fold<br>
guidance (as we lack the machine-phase reactive-moiety Gatling<br>
guns), and a large density of (mated, in the assembled cell)<br>
complementary surfaces essential in the hierarchical autoassembly<br>
process, structures will be much coarser, and since the crosslink<br>
concentration must be low, mechanical properties drastically<br>
worse than that of a diamodoid solid. Isotopically pure CVD<br>
diamond wafers are the best heat conductors known to man (people<br>
like to slice ice cubes with them for a demo, using merely the<br>
heat of your fingers), while linear polymers, even if dry and<br>
crosslinked, do not conduct at all well, nor would they withstand<br>
much higher operation temperatures than 400 K, or so, before<br>
denaturating irreversibly, while diamondoid matrix might survive<br>
at up to 800 K for prolonged periods of time.<br>
<p>
(It is interesting to speculate, whether low-K temperature range<br>
quantum dot (not qubits) arrays can achieve radically new kind of<br>
high-density, high-speed, low-power-dissipation computational<br>
devices, but here I am entirely out of my depth. Likewise in<br>
solid-state qubit devices (which I deem unusable, but then that's<br>
just meek me). Resident physicists please step forth to enlighten<br>
us).<br>
<p>
Anyway, the maximal concentration of circuitry in the embedding<br>
matrix, and the limiting amount of dissipated power per volume,<br>
as signal travel delay threshold for a given propagating distance,<br>
(as imposed upon us by that pretty unpopular piece of relativistic<br>
physics), seem to imply there are indeed tight limits to bit<br>
integration density and their kinetics both, even though I am<br>
currently somewhat at loss of giving even ballpark figures.<br>
<p>
I guess, that without resorting to yet hypothetical machine-phase<br>
chemistry, one could implement a molecular CAM with an elementary<br>
cell with a 0.1-1 um edge (this gives us a integration density<br>
uncertainty bandwidth of merely three orders of magnitude), and<br>
absolute upper limits to switching speed of roughly 10^14, or<br>
10 THz (visible light photons, of roughly 0.4-0.8 um wavelength<br>
(at least the green/blue ones), bear enough energy to lyse bonds<br>
en masse, obviously a strong no-no in a computer, even a<br>
fault-tolerat one, since defect rate must remain below a<br>
certain threshold to be able to operate the circuitry for a<br>
sufficient time span for it to be useful, before it has to be<br>
replaced by a freshly synthesized module).<br>
<p>
As EM radiation in vacuum (in matter significantly slower, the<br>
slower the higher the refractive index and vice versa) travels<br>
roughly 30 cm in 1 ns (1 GHz clock, coming soon to a desktop near<br>
you, e.g. as Merced, though I'd rather like a PIM (processor-in-<br>
memory design) instead), 0.3 mm (300 um) in 1 ps (1 THz clock,<br>
which is unattainable with semiconductor technology), and 0.3 um<br>
(300 nm) in 0.1 fs (1 pHz clock), whereas EM of 1 um wavelength<br>
(still NIR) has a frequency of about 3*10^14 Hz, or theoretical<br>
maximal switching time in fs range, we have discovered our outer<br>
limits at the individual molecular switch model (please notice<br>
that we have not adressed the very thorny issue of maximal switch<br>
concentration yet, which is a function of both the assembly<br>
process, and cooling system efficiency). We know that the<br>
transfer of energy by direct electromagnetic interaction between<br>
chlorophylls is considered to be pretty rapid, while happening<br>
in 10^12 s (ps) range.<br>
<p>
Hence it seems to be realistic to assume maximal switching speeds<br>
achievable with physical structures to lie somewhere in the ps..fs<br>
range, 1 THz - 1 pHz, the lower bound to be more probable. Perhaps<br>
my earlier mentioning of "clock" was somewhat misleading: it is<br>
quite clear that, due to relavistic constraints, assuming<br>
synchronized action by a global clock appear unfeasible. Rather,<br>
a system of locally-coupled, externally pumped oscillators, where<br>
synchronization emerges at a higher operational plain appears more<br>
feasible.<br>
<p>
Personally, I like laser pumping, where a system of dyes funnels<br>
the energy into an orthogonal 1d metal grid, crisscrossing the<br>
crystal, and acting as a transient energy storage (as photon<br>
absorption is a stochastic event, we cannot count on cell-local<br>
dye assembly to provide cell-local juice at any time) system,<br>
which then feeds the individual cells. A pulsed operation can<br>
be envisioned, with each pulse pumping up the energy cache, until<br>
it discharges spontaneously, or triggered by a second laser pulse.<br>
If we assume 1 ps for 1 um CAM cell switching time, we can expect<br>
a information light cone propagation velocity of roughly 2 um/1 ps,<br>
or 2 Mm/s, almost 1% of c.<br>
<p>
(Anyway, as we now have arrived at the very heart of Never-Never<br>
Land, and I am notorious for goofing up my math this numbers should<br>
be taken cum grano salis. If your bogosity detector notices a<br>
supercritical bozon flux, please let the list know).<br>
<p>
Let us leap up to the next integration level: energy dissipation<br>
will impose a tight limit onto volume/surface ratio. Whereas<br>
diamondoid systems can directly radiate power into few-K space,<br>
molecular CAMs must be fluid-cooled. I guess one could engineer<br>
proteins the resulting crystals to feature orthogonally aligned<br>
mesopores/channels for the cooling fluid to seep through<br>
(this opens the opportunity for chemical energy pumping), but<br>
this will make the crystal much more brittle, and further dilute<br>
the circuitry concentration.<br>
<p>
On the module cluster level, we have a mechanical gravitation/<br>
tidal/resonance problem. If we assume the computational nodes to<br>
be mounted on a stiff truss structure, sooner or later tidal<br>
forces, own gravity, and vibration resonance (a problem already<br>
plaguing today's satellite photovoltaics arrays).<br>
<p>
So sooner, or later, we must resort to freely orbiting computational<br>
nodes. If we consider them to be orbiting around their own center of<br>
gravity, orbit perturbations both require the need for active position<br>
control, and limit the maximal module/space voxel. Since their<br>
relative velocities might be considerable, collisions may trigger<br>
release of debris, the so-called fragmentation catastrophe. The need<br>
for active position control requires reactive mass, which must be<br>
sometimes replenished. If solar sails are utilized, this will<br>
dilute the circuitry even further. All in all, a nontrivial<br>
multidimensional optimization problem, as the optimal grain<br>
size of each hierarchy must be chosen.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, it is instrumental to realize, that gravitation tends<br>
to create circular, wrap-around structures. Whether nodes on a<br>
planetary surface, nodes orbiting around their common gravity<br>
center, or a star, the node grid is subtly distorted, with node<br>
neighbourhood relation in constant flux. If we assume geodesic<br>
(a quite inappropriate term for an orbiting node cluster) routing<br>
scheme, where a data packet emerged somewhere deep within the<br>
individual molecular circuitry piece has to worm its way towards<br>
surface, being beamed node along node, unless finding the right<br>
node, the right target metaCAM subcell, we must assume each node<br>
to bear an identity which is not a function of relative position.<br>
Instead, node IDs could be derived from a global position,<br>
requiring beakon nodes. As node orbits are deterministic on<br>
the short (a few revolutions) run, perhaps this information<br>
can be used.<br>
<p>
As mankind's machines are going to spin off into interplanetary<br>
space, we need a GPS++, which is also handy for node ID derivation.<br>
The natural coordinate system for the solar system seems to be<br>
obviously a heliocentric one.<br>

P.S. This is a pretty old post sketch, expanded on the fly --<br>
     sorry if I rehash trivialities. <br>
