Hal Finney &lt;hal@rain.org&gt; commented:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You may have to live in a cartoon world.</i><br>
<p>
	We already live in a cartoon world!  (Although I prefer to<br>
call it a spiritual world).  Everything we are directly aware of is<br>
reproduced inside our brain via the data collected by our senses.<br>
This entire world that is our conscious knowledge is inside our brain.<br>
You aren't directly aware of that tree out beyond your eyes.  You<br>
can't be because the information flows into your eyes, not out of!<br>
You only have a phenomenal representation of that tree in your cartoon<br>
world inside your brain.  When you stub your toe, the pain isn't in<br>
the real toe, that would be impossible.  The pain is inside the cartoon<br>
toe that is inside this cartoon world that is entirely inside your<br>
head.  All this stuff only represents what is out beyond your senses.<br>
<p>
	There is no color, smell, warmth, pain and so on and so forth<br>
outside our brains.  This is all cartoon stuff. (I prefer to call it<br>
spiritual stuff) There is only the light, chemical content, vibrating<br>
molecules, and the destruction and such that these cartoon things only<br>
consciously represent.<br>
<p>
	The exciting thing about uploading, is we will finally be able<br>
to escape from our lonely isolated cartoon worlds, that are trapped<br>
inside our skulls, into a unified and shared spiritual world of global<br>
consciousness.<br>
