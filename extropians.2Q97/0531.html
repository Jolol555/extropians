<i>&gt; Anyone notice an "urban legend awareness" meme lately?  A.K.A. the "Here's</i><br>
<i>&gt; something else that didn't really happen" meme or the "Be careful what you</i><br>
<i>&gt; THINK you know" meme.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's either:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A. Just me.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; -or-</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B. There is a lot more awareness of urban myths and legends lately.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The "urban" from urban legend comes from the idea that it is in the cities</i><br>
<i>&gt; where there are a large number of people to spread them (transmitters or</i><br>
<i>&gt; "vectors").  The same happens in the corporate workplace where there are a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of people.  And, now with the Internet there are a lot of people sharing</i><br>
<i>&gt; info and spreading stories, some of which are urban myths, for example see</i><br>
<i>&gt; the following list of urban myths that are false.  My theory is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Internet has also facilitated the spread of the "Here's something else that</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't really happen" meme.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * The criminal ring of highly-skilled surgeons who steal kidneys from</i><br>
<i>&gt; unsuspecting victims to sell on the black market.</i><br>
<p>
No but the protocols that surgeons are using to determine when to start<br>
taking organs shows that the drugs they give prior to "death" are not<br>
helpful to the patient and prevent the patient from clotting any wounds,<br>
and there have been documented cases of head trauma patients at the<br>
Cleveland Center where the time listed on the death certificate as to<br>
when the heart stopped beating was when it was cut out of the patient's<br>
body. This sort of treatment is what engenders the far out stories like<br>
you cited...<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * The homosexual act of sending a gerbil (or hamster) up a toilet-paper tube</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the anus.</i><br>
<p>
it was actually a stalinist torture method in eastern europe, and a<br>
hungry rat was used...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * The helicopter that fights forest fires by scooping water from lake.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Charred body of scuba diver found in ashes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * People occasionally spontaneously combust and burn to death.</i><br>
<p>
Cool.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * The razor blade in the Halloween apples and other Halloween candy-tampering.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Snuff films exist.</i><br>
<p>
What are they?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * There are satanic symbols on the Proctor &amp; Gamble logo.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Numerous Internet virus hoaxes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Suicide rates go up around the holidays.</i><br>
<p>
They actually go down.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Domestic violence goes up on Super Bowl Sunday.</i><br>
<p>
I know, there were a lot of articles in the paper on this last<br>
Superbowl, with interviews of people who run womens shelters saying that<br>
this is true.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * People are much loonier (e.g., shoot, screw, etc.) during a full moon.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * "Blue star" or cartoon character (esp. Mickey Mouse) tattoos laced with</i><br>
<i>&gt; LSD is sold at schools to hook kids on acid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * There was a fried rat served in a Kentucky-Fried Chicken restaurant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Aspirin and Coca-Cola taken together get you high. (Nope. May cause insomnia.)</i><br>
<p>
I haddn't heard that one, but I had heard that Mikey, the kid on the<br>
Life cereal commercial, had died from eating Pop Rocks candy and<br>
drinking Coca-Cola. False.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Henry Ford/Gen. Douglas McArthur/T. Edison/IBM Rep./et al. tests an</i><br>
<i>&gt; interviewee by when they salt their food during lunch.</i><br>
<p>
It was Howard Hughes, and it was steak at his casino in Las Vegas...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * Albert Einstein did poorly in school.</i><br>
<p>
Nah, he just didn't talk much till age three or four.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * We only use 10% of our brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * NASA did experiement on making love in zero gravity.</i><br>
<p>
Actually a married pair of astronauts did go up 2 years ago, and were<br>
supposed to be doing some "research" on it, at least according to what<br>
the other astronauts said in interviews. If its false, we've got some<br>
astronauts spreading disinformation...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; * No two snowflakes are alike.</i><br>
<p>
You mean they've cloned snowflakes down to the atom?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Here's a real urban legend: people don't kill people, guns kill<br>
people...<br>
