Yes.  This also ties into something I was thinking about this morning <br>
as I dragged my weary rear to a protest rally, in that the extent of <br>
the Extropian commitment to E-prime may render the process of <br>
image-making a bit difficult.  Our media tends to fall into the <br>
programmatic 'I am', and activists utilize this to get points across <br>
succinctly.  You adopt a political identity and render your own self <br>
as the image of that identity, thereby providing both a visual <br>
reinforcement of the verbal message.  And that political identity can <br>
change according to the issue at hand, but because it is only a <br>
temporary rendering and not a permanent life state, you can step out <br>
of it in private.  I've been wondering the extent to which Extropians <br>
who are in the media spotlight utilize this strategy, and I have <br>
pondered it in relation to my own contributions to the Internet <br>
Political Report.  <br>
