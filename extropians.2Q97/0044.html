That tells me that our naive notions about what is easy and what is difficult <br>
are wrong. Today's computers don't have much trouble with higher math but <br>
with more mundane things like pattern recognition, manual dexterity and that <br>
grab bag of skills and knowledge we call common sense. Only recently has much <br>
progress been made. One surprising thing computer science has taught us is <br>
that an enormous about of brain -power is needed to perform an apparently <br>
simple task like moping a floor. How do I pick up the mop? Is that dirt on <br>
the floor or is it a shadow? Should I move that obstacle or go around it? <br>
How long should I try to get rid of that stain before I give up? <br>
<p>
These problems don't seem hard to us because we're very good at them. Natural <br>
selection gave a big advantage to those who were good at spotting the pattern<br>
of a saber toothed tiger hiding in the bushes, but no advantage to those who <br>
were good at solving differential equations. It is not mere rhetoric to say <br>
that in an absolute sense a janitor has a more intellectually challenging job <br>
than a professor of mathematics.<br>

I don't see how. Even with his tiny brain a rat can feel, and I can find no <br>
evidence that his emotions are inferior to ours, even though our brain is a <br>
thousand times larger. I can find lots of evidence that a rat's thinking is <br>
inferior to ours.                                 <br>
