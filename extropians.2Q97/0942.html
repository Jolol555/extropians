See the end of my reply to Mr. Metzger and take a look at the real<br>
effects and extent of poverty in the US.<br>
<p>
TV is a guaranteed necessity in Germany. It can't be seized in any case.<br>
<p>
Best way to manipulate large numbers of people. No free decision.<br>

<p>
Oh, it was Stalin's grandson. Then he must be right, of course.<br>
<p>
In the US, politicians struggle to make the rich richer. That's all.<br>
