This is true. In my basic neuroscience course a pathologist gleefully<br>
showed us slides of various malformed brains. You can remain normal<br>
with some rather non-trivial damage, especially if they are in-born. <br>
One of the more interesting types consisted of cortex embedded inside<br>
the white matter or even turned inside out! During early development,<br>
radial glia cells provide a scaffolding which the neuroblasts climb<br>
to the brain surface, where they form the cortex. The lowest layers<br>
develop first, and higher layers climb past them (another absurd<br>
result of evolution). Under some (rare) circumstances this process<br>
fails, and the cortex is inside out or pieces of it are left inside<br>
the brain. According to the pathologist the victims can be quite<br>
normal (although, as he put it, "few are Einsteins").<br>

Sounds vaguely possible; although I buy James explanation as more<br>
likely:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Sounds like Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, a common symptom of which is</i><br>

<p>
There is even a certain "look" to it, with drooping eyelids and a<br>
subtle shift in facial features. Yet another reason to avoid alcohol.<br>
