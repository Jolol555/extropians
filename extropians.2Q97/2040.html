Sayeth Miss Rand after reading Nietzche's "The Birth of Tragedy:<br>
He is "statedly anti-reason.  He said that reason is an inferior faculty,<br>
that drunken-orgy emotions were supereior.  That finished him as a<br>
spiritual ally."  (from the biography by Barbara Branden,  "The Passion of<br>
Ayn Rand" <br>
<p>
I found "Atlas Shrugged" to be very ingaging, and have taken many valuable<br>
lessons from her philosophy, as well as some that are best unlearned.  I<br>
haven't read any Nietzche, but would like to-- I dig drunken-orgies.  ;-&gt;<br>
