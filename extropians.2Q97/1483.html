<i>&gt; Please no!  It's bad enough having people who think they can talk on their</i><br>

<p>
Am I the only one wondering why cellphones usually have no headsets? But <br>
agreed, jabbering on the street is very thete. Rather give me a BAC, or <br>
an implant to generate output vectors at will. You won't see nor hear a <br>
single thing.<br>

<i>&gt; Why, exactly, do you need a head-up and a head tracker to replace paper ?</i><br>
<p>
Because paper is static, and not smart. Because it's flat, monochrome,<br>
kills trees, produces waste, and requires lots of pointless infrastructure<br>
which is not under my immediate control. The only niche for the paper is<br>
not bureau, but the toilet. Paper does not listen when I talk to it, and<br>
it doesn't at all search well. Because I need hands to handle it. Paper<br>
doesn't render VRML very well, nor can it do live video. Only audio paper<br>
can do is &lt;rustle&gt; &lt;rustle&gt;. Paper heaps have no memory on their previous<br>
arrangement. Paper is bulky, not machine readable, and does not age<br>
gracefully. Paper can't add, divide, or FFT. Paper attracts termites and<br>
fires.  Paper contains dioxines. People have been killed by collapsing <br>
paper. On the whole, paper is a definite hazard to civilization. <br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
(Ok, HMD is no good at origami).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; When was the last time you walk around with paper stuck to your face ?</i><br>
<p>
Think see-thru headups, as non-dominant eye monocles, or i-glasses type <br>
of display (but better resolution, structureless pixel, wide-angle large <br>
opening pupil, eye tracking, etc.)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; (don't answer).  Here's a good replacement for paper, paper!  Smart paper,</i><br>
<i>&gt; made from thin, flexible displays or smart ink.  You can pick it up, write on</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, save the document and leave it for the next person.</i><br>
<p>
The idea is, everybody has an augmented reality rig. I let the <br>
representation of a document hover in space for the next guy to pick up. <br>
I can toss the document to a passer-by, whether it is a real passer-by, <br>
or a ghost. I can beam it to anybody who is interested. And best of all, I <br>
don't need even hands for that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; People yearn for wearables. They just don't know it yet. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think people know exactly what they want - something that works, something</i><br>
<i>&gt; that makes life easier.  I think one of the reasons why they aren't getting</i><br>
<p>
People buy what other people tell them. It's called marketing and peer <br>
pressure. 95% of all people suspend all ratio when buying consumer goods.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; what they want is the acceptance that computers are complex, difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt; machines.</i><br>
<p>
Humans are also complex, difficult machines. But surprisingly user-friendly<br>
(well, some of them). Whatever happened to our fabled human design? <br>
Unable to cloak boring complexity. Tsk, tsk. Baaad designer.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can anyone tell me why an SG O2, a professional workstation, is easier to</i><br>
<i>&gt; setup, install, use and upgrade than a home PC ?  It's not the cost!</i><br>
<p>
Because the average consumer is a turkey. Ever seen a Lisp machine? Ever <br>
seen a Forth machine? Ever seen an Oberon 2 machine?<br>
<p>
Forget unix. Unix is not sexy. Unix is simply the lesser evil of those on <br>
the market. Make? C? Memory leaks? Dangling pointers? Core dumps? <br>
<p>
Brittle?  Who _dares_ to say brittle? <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;Now this is a challenge for marketing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It's a lot to ask from an industry seems to spend more time making colorful</i><br>
<i>&gt; icons than making computers that don't crash, files that don't corrupt and</i><br>
<i>&gt; applications that don't just decide to 'loose all unsaved information'.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ~Wax</i><br>
<p>
For crying out aloud, it has taken the industry mainstream two decades to<br>
adopt virtual machines and garbage collection. Brave brand new world. I<br>
feel like breaking down and crying. <br>
<p>
Drivers? Why the device either understands the message, or doesn't.  What,<br>
no incremental compilation? Files? Which files? Ah, you probably mean<br>
persistant objects.  Which "corruption"? This is distributed nonvolatile<br>
holographic store.  What is 'save'? You mean your computer can drop state,<br>
and does not keep a history? Aw come on, joker.<br>
<p>
Wake up, 'gene. This is 1997, and IBM, Microsoft and Intel are not to <br>
blame. You and I are to blame. The consumer boneheads.<br>
<p>
<p>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
