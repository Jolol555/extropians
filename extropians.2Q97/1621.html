The trait would be advantageous *only* if it carried no disadvantages.  The<br>
general idea is that almost every mutation that come up for humans that would<br>
extend life carries some disadvantage - stricter dietary requirement, delayed<br>
puberty, greater chance of death by disease, etc.  Those that help, we do<br>
have, and that's why we live decades rather than minutes.<br>
<p>
It may also be that extended life is a disadvantage in and of itself by<br>
slowing adaption to parasites and diseases.<br>
