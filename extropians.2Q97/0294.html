At the exi-bay meeting last night, it occurred to me that Robin<br>
Hansen's idea for fixed-time debates could be adapted to a mailing<br>
list like this to control list traffic and optimize quality of<br>
postings.  It might require the involvement of some cypherpunks<br>
to write parts of the software (depending on how strictly we want<br>
to enforce the rules), so I would appreciate it if someone here<br>
who is also involved with that community could forward this.<br>
<p>
Robin's original idea was this: at the start of a multi-person<br>
debate, issue each participant a fixed number of tokens.  A device<br>
that beeps a certain number of times per minute (but not at fixed<br>
intervals so it's unpredictable) is placed on the table.  Whoever<br>
is talking when a beep is heard discards one of his tokens.  No<br>
tokens, no talk.  But here's the catch: the tokens are fungible,<br>
so that if you find someone interesting, or making your point<br>
bettter than you would, you can toss him some of your tokens.  If<br>
you want to talk more, you can beg tokens from others.  The total<br>
time of the debate is fixed, but who talks most depends on who<br>
the participants want to hear from most.<br>
<p>
To adapt this to a mailing list, the moderator of the list maintains<br>
a Chaumian digicash mint (here's where we need cypherpunks), in which<br>
the digicoins are /posting rights/, and are similarly exchangeable.<br>
If you're rich and don't have anything to say, email your coins to<br>
someone you find interesting.  If you're poor and want to post, beg<br>
for coins from others.  Or another possibility is to archive every<br>
message sent, paid for or not, but only distribute the paid ones;<br>
then anyone with more time who wanted to could browse the unpaid<br>
archive and send mail to some poster saying "I liked this, and I'll<br>
pay for you to post it to the main list."  That way we eliminate<br>
begging by email, which might make some uncomfortable.  Posting to<br>
the unpaid list is something like lobbying for a grant.<br>
<p>
The details that need to be worked out are the specific method used<br>
for distributing and cashing in the coins.  We might not even need<br>
something as complex as digicash: just issue coins as serial numbers,<br>
and tell people to put the number in brackets on line 1 of the post<br>
to spend it.  The moderator might maintain a 'bot that issues the<br>
coins randomly to list members at a given rate, and he can control<br>
the rate to "inflate" the list if there's a good discussion going on,<br>
or slow its growth during quiet periods to avoid accumulation.<br>
<p>
The minimal setup is this: two distribution lists (paid and unpaid),<br>
a robot at the list address that splits the messages and cashes the<br>
the coins, a robot that issues the coins, two Web archives.  Perhaps<br>
better is to have a robot actually keep track of all the coins and<br>
who owns them, so that users won't lose them--that would require<br>
them to go to a web page form to give a coin to another list member.<br>
Perhaps some user software to simplify the process would be nice.<br>
<p>
One problem I forsee: since the above assumes 1 coin=1 post, there<br>
will be incentive to make long rambling single posts on multiple<br>
topics, so we may have to either set a fixed limit, or pay per page,<br>
or some other standard (but then quoting or attributing others costs<br>
you, so would discourage that).<br>
<p>
Any ideas how to fix those incentives, or other ideas?<br>
