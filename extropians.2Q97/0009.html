Robin Hanson:<br>
<i>&gt; It seems to me we are far from the point where the losses from</i><br>
<i>&gt; moving are less than the losses from defending via central military</i><br>
<i>&gt; coordination.</i><br>
<p>
Since the free rider effect occurs in governmental as well as private<br>
solutions to the public goods problem, the cost of a central military may<br>
only need to be a significant fraction of the cost of a military loss for<br>
defunding of the military to occur.  That fraction is merely<br>
somewhat smaller for the voluntary as opposed to<br>
the coerced centralized solutions, but smaller enough so that <br>
coercion has usually triumphed.   Decentralized security will, when<br>
it is a viable and widely recognized technological option, have far greater <br>
funding, and thus the possibility of  winning even in the face of substantial <br>
battlefield inferiority.   <br>
<p>
Think of regulatory arbitrage, with taxpayers using various kinds of<br>
mobility, in some cases of their investment funds, in some cases of their<br>
persons.    A person evading taxes incurs negligible increase risked of foreign<br>
invasion due to the absence of their own tax payments in the pot.   They do<br>
incur increased personal risk from the tax collector.   If they can use <br>
decentralized security services to make that risk small enough to be worth<br>
the savings, they will come out ahead of the game.   Enough people come <br>
out ahead of the game, and centralized coercively funded militaries are <br>
history.<br>
<p>
In the U.S.,  tax rates are typically 30-40%, but military funding<br>
represents less than 4% of GDP.   So we have a 10:1 advantage for excludable <br>
military technology, even before accounting for the efficiency gains to be had<br>
from a competitive market instead of a legal monopoly, and before taking<br>
into account the free rider effect, that in the decentralized case the customer<br>
benefits directly from their expenditure, rather than benefiting at the<br>
insignificant margin.<br>
<p>
So, the question for futuristic analysis is how a decentralized voluntary "military", <br>
which might take the form of cryptography, untraceable payments and <br>
communications, cooked books,  offshore corporations,  hit squads to deter <br>
tax audits, and so on, can fare against tax collectors.   We see right away<br>
that traditional centralized military solutions are useless in combatting this <br>
decentralized threat.   You won’t make a tax-evading Wall Street investor<br>
pay by nuking New York City in front of the world’s TV cameras.  Whether tax <br>
collectors can find other solutions in  this futuristic scenario is an interesting <br>
question.   The mortgage deduction is one powerful solution that has been <br>
found for pinning people down on big chunks of fixed capital.<br>
<p>
Of course, I don’t expect very many people working for a taxpayer-funded <br>
institutions argue in favor of such tax defunding scenarios.  There will<br>
be a substantial lag between technological capability and cultural<br>
realization.<br>
<p>
Onwards,<br>
Zylof<br>
