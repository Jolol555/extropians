I can give a very concrete example of mobile working.  I recently finished<br>
a software development project where the members of the development team (<br>
10-15 developers over the life of the project ) were not physically<br>
co-located at all.  The job was in Los Angeles, but most of the work was<br>
done in Silicon Valley, Washington D.C., and Germany by individual<br>
developers on their own time schedule.  The project and code management<br>
made heavy use of the Internet and telephone.  <br>
<p>
This is not only a cheaper way to work ( low overhead ), but is in many<br>
ways more efficient as well.  We  created a virtual development team to<br>
suit the particular project.  Due to the difficulty of getting everyone<br>
into one location, meetings were only held when absolutely necessary ( a<br>
major efficiency multiplier! ).<br>
<p>
I normally work from home, but a couple of the developers were literally<br>
travelling through various parts of the world as they worked on this (have<br>
modem, will travel!).<br>
<p>
Some stats on the type and size of this project for those interested:<br>
  <br>
750,000 lines of code, $1.5M total cost, and 10 months of development effort.<br>
The project involved the development of the core business app for France<br>
Telecomm's GlobeCast conglomerate.  <br>
It is believed to be the world's largest and most sophisticated<br>
Oracle-based Intranet application and involved the development of many<br>
tools and techniques which I still haven't seen developed anywhere else.<br>
