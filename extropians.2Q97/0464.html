Let us swap some good antihelmintica urls.<br>

<p>
PFP/iPFP? _The_ most trivial problem of entire molecular biology.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	The overall question is how a protein with a certain sequence of amino</i><br>
<i>&gt; acids takes the form of a unique three dimensional structure in water/body.</i><br>
<p>
Actually I think the inverse problem is much more interesting. (I <br>
also think it also to be much harder).<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The next level of question to this, what are(is) the most dominating</i><br>
<i>&gt; forces in the formation of the unique structure.  In the 60's an oil drop</i><br>
<p>
The most dominating? Volume exclusion. At biological energy levels no two <br>
atoms may occupy the same place. Second by stringence: no covalent bond <br>
may break (ignoring autocatalytical scissile bond activity, which is Rare). <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; in water was suggested and said as the oil in water collapses to a globule</i><br>
<i>&gt; so does a stretched sequence of protein collapses into a globular-like</i><br>
<p>
Uh, it is more than crude. It is an important contribution, but without <br>
other's contribution impact your Hamiltonian is entirely bogus.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; structure.  This force was/is called hydrophobicity.  Later on it was found</i><br>
<i>&gt; that water around oil/apolar groups in proteins forms very organized</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures known as clathartes/ice-like structures etc.  These "ice-like"</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Clathrate domains are long and well known structures. In fact water has <br>
nanoscopic, fluctuating ice domains. Methane/water clathrate is very well <br>
known due to its propensity to clog up siberian gas pipelines. Modeling <br>
methane aggregation in a water box is very well known PFP toy model.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; structures have small entropy (high structure)  Until recently the</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding was up to this point: formation of highly organized</i><br>
<i>&gt; structures around apolar groups.  Recently it has been found that the low</i><br>
<i>&gt; entropy phenomena is not restricted to apolar groups but is found for water</i><br>
<i>&gt; around polar groups as well.  So what do we do?  What is so unique about</i><br>
<p>
PFP people are a heterogenous field, there is very little dogma there.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; water around polar groups (oily matter)?  It has been found it the past few</i><br>
<i>&gt; years that the heat capacity (tendency to absorb heat) around apolar groups</i><br>
<i>&gt; increases while the heat capacity of water around polar groups decreases. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Can this last observation be reproduced by computer simulations?  Can this</i><br>
<i>&gt; be explained by a reasonable theory?</i><br>
<p>
Why is heat capacity of such an interest to you? _Which_ heat capacity? <br>
Besides, I doubt heat capacity has much relevance in nanocluster domain.<br>
Modeling? Sure you can model that.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	If it is understood how water behaves around apolar groups and polar</i><br>
<i>&gt; groups in proteins, it will be easy to understand and predict the formation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a unique 3-dimensional structure from a sequence of protein.  Hence the</i><br>
<p>
Oh no. You forgot the oompteen other contributions. Trivial example: two <br>
helices interact strongly, being macroscopical dipoles. And water is not <br>
the only context, what about phospholipid bilayers? Assymetric bilayers? <br>
How about influence of protein history upon tertiary structure? <br>
Disulfides require certain redox potential, and chaperonines have some <br>
crucial aspects to the fate of misfolded proteins. Being under kinetical <br>
control, ribosome outlet channel/transmembrane transport protein pore <br>
geometry has a distinct impact on tert structure.<br>
<p>
Context is crucial: in vivo may fold different from in vitro.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; design of a drug from a computer for a diseased protein.</i><br>
<p>
Easy it is not. PFP, and particularly IPFP require dedicated hardware and <br>
novel algorithms to be usable. Coming soon to a site near you.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	We would appreciate any discussion of this problem.</i><br>
<p>
Let's discuss antihelmintica instead. Tapeworms are fascinating creatures.<br>
