Chris Thompson:<br>
<i>&gt;The two extropian stances on Politics, as I see it, are Becoming a</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perpetual Traveler and dropping out entirely (and legally), or playing</i><br>
<i>&gt;the political game to it's fullest, using it as one uses a hammer or a</i><br>
<i>&gt;crowbar.</i><br>
<p>
And you can always use both of them. This reminds me of a wild<br>
discussion I had with a friend recently (originally about a friend<br>
whos unemployed). He complained about the system, and argued that<br>
you should have a strong political opinion of the things that are wrong.<br>
I strongly insisted on having no opinion about the system at all. Even<br>
though I was very firm about it, he didn't took my opinion serously :-(<br>
