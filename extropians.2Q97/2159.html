Diamonds are not durable even under moderately high temperatures <br>

environmental conditions.<br>

<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;p&gt;The surface of the Sun is hotter than the boiling point of any known </i><br>
<i>&gt; material.  Indeed, it is hot enough to rip any known molecule into atoms.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; One might think this would preclude the direct exploration and </i><br>
<i>&gt; exploitation of the Sun.  However, this is not the case.  It </i><br>
<i>&gt; is possible to build a device that can operate for long periods of time in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the atmosphere of the Sun.  This can be done with plausible near-term </i><br>
<i>&gt; technology, operating with known materials and entirely within the </i><br>
<i>&gt; well-established laws of physics.  </i><br>
<p>
Like Silicon or Tungsten Nitride as my favorites.  Silicon Nitride <br>
is a wonderful material that allows you to make loaded bearings <br>
without pesky hydrocarbon lubrication. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;p&gt;I call my design for such a device a &lt;i&gt;heliopter&lt;/i&gt; (from the Greek </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;i&gt;helios&lt;/i&gt;, Sun, and &lt;i&gt;pter&lt;/i&gt;, wing).  It is essentialy a helicopter </i><br>
<i>&gt; that can hover indefinitely in the Solar atmosphere, using solar energy as </i><br>
<i>&gt; a power source.  </i><br>
<p>
Will this energy be utilized as heat to run a turbine, do <br>
that standard p-n junction like photovoltaics or high temperature <br>
based thermionics for electricity?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;p&gt;First I will discuss the environment of the solar atmosphere.  This is </i><br>
<i>&gt; well-established science.  Then I will discuss how one might keep an </i><br>
<i>&gt; object immersed in that atmosphere cold enough to remain solid.  This is </i><br>
<i>&gt; an application of well-established engineering thermodynamics.  Finally, I </i><br>
<i>&gt; will describe the heliopter as a whole.  This is an excercise in wild-ass </i><br>
<i>&gt; system engineering.  There's nothing in the design that I know to be </i><br>
<i>&gt; infeasible, but I certainly haven't worked out every stress and heat flux </i><br>
<i>&gt; and confirmed that it will work. [end excerpt]</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; o Outgoing radiation doesn't have to have a blackbody spectrum.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   Lasing comes to mind, or one could heat up relatively small</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   radiators to a very high temperature.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Lasing in particular is very bad.  You wouldn't know it to look at one, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; laser beams are very cold, i.e. have very low entropy.  Thermodynamically</i><br>
<i>&gt; speaking, they're like a perfect crystal at very low temperature, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; process of producing one requires extracting lots of entropy from a lasing</i><br>
<i>&gt; medium and dumping it in the environment.  Trying to cool something by</i><br>
<i>&gt; emitting a laser beam is like trying to cool your house by installing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful freezer, making lots of ice cubes, and throwing them out the</i><br>
<i>&gt; window.  (Hmmm... that has a certain surreal delight to it.  Imagine a house</i><br>
<i>&gt; with ice cubes flying out all the windows...)</i><br>
<p>
There is an engineer that has conducted an experiment that actually <br>
successfully used a 40 watt laser to cool a crystal in a surprising way.  <br>
As a matter of fact, the paper on the technique is something else to read.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; That's OK, I love giving answers. -- CarlF</i><br>
<p>
A distant laser beam could potentially provide a remote cooling source to <br>
optically relocate the entropy of the heliopter while it is very close to <br>
the atmosphere of the Sun.  The radiator would appear as black, but <br>
actually could be reflective to the optical coupling to the remote <br>
cooling laser array.  Phase cooling is also valuable for nano-technology, <br>
silicon semiconductor fabrication and in vacuum object thermal shunting.<br>
