<p>
There are two recent trends, both of which favor asexual reproduction:<br>
<p>
1) Until recently, organisms have had very little occasion to make<br>
long-term investments other than children.  So the investment benefit<br>
of asexual reproduction has been moot.  But now humans do have to<br>
choose between "consuming" their own ability to have more children<br>
now, and investing toward their children's ability to have more<br>
children later.<br>
<p>
2) Until recently, orgnisms have had very little effective means to<br>
communicated information about how to build better organims, other than<br>
via sexual reproduction.  Now humans can exchange culture and memes,<br>
and and uploads &amp; A.I.s may be able to buy and sell new designs for<br>
their componenets and new knowledge on a truely vast scale.  Sexual<br>
reproduction won't be needed to exchange this information.<br>
