<p>
If we skip details about *how* genes (that is, the information that<br>
is used to produce an offspring) get from here to there, the distinction<br>
between asexual and sexual reproduction boils down to *where* the<br>
information comes from.  Does it all descend from the information that<br>
originally went into the parent, with no other input, *or does it come<br>
from more than one source*?  If the latter, that's sex in my book.<br>
<p>
Robin, you are clearly using a different definition of "sexual<br>
reproduction" since you are talking about different ways of<br>
exchanging information (the essence of sex as I see it)--what is your<br>
distinction and why is it interesting?  Are you only talking about<br>
*current* methods of mixing information vs... *all the possible other<br>
ways*?  To me, most of the possible ways of mixing information<br>
are even *more* sexual than the current two-parent, crossover-only<br>
methods.  Why do you use the term "asexual" for these more-sexy methods?<br>
<p>
One way of making the distinction (motivated by your question of how<br>
people's behavior and repro strategies might change) would be: does<br>
the contribution of the other parent come as a package deal?  Even<br>
if genes become nanite subroutines sent over the internet, package-deals<br>
would still be possible.  (N mutually suspecting parties can agree to<br>
put their separate contributions into a box where<br>
some agreed-on process determines the combination.)  Maybe package<br>
deals would have a long-term advantage over finer-grain choosability...<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;There are two recent trends, both of which favor asexual reproduction:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1) Until recently, organisms have had very little occasion to make</i><br>
<i>&gt;long-term investments other than children.  So the investment benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt;of asexual reproduction has been moot.  But now humans do have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;choose between "consuming" their own ability to have more children</i><br>
<i>&gt;now, and investing toward their children's ability to have more</i><br>
<i>&gt;children later.</i><br>
<p>
I think this just means, reproduce now (with current methods) vs.<br>
invest, then reproduce more wisely later?  The sexual/asexual question<br>
seems independent here, even with your definition.  For instance, I<br>
could become rich and marry a carefully selected mate who was<br>
capable of bearing large litters, and fund the raising of all these<br>
kids.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;2) Until recently, orgnisms have had very little effective means to</i><br>
<i>&gt;communicated information about how to build better organims, other than</i><br>
<i>&gt;via sexual reproduction.  Now humans can exchange culture and memes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and and uploads &amp; A.I.s may be able to buy and sell new designs for</i><br>
<i>&gt;their componenets and new knowledge on a truely vast scale.  Sexual</i><br>
<i>&gt;reproduction won't be needed to exchange this information.</i><br>
<p>
You seem to be saying, the *old way* of exchanging info is limited,<br>
and there will be more interesting ways.  Yes, you're right!<br>
<p>
But still it's sexual reproduction, in the sense that all the things<br>
we know about sexual reproduction (and the comparison with asexual<br>
reproduction) still apply, right?  I mean, for instance, observations<br>
about selfish genes, or dynamics where two synergistic genes build up<br>
slowly in a gene pool, then suddenly take over when they reach a threshold<br>
of popularity, etc.  Phenomena that biologists think of as applying<br>
only to species that have sex.<br>
<p>
The reason I ask is that I could imagine things that would really<br>
deserve the term asexual--hermits going off and purposely isolating<br>
themselves from contamination by others' ideas--that might be<br>
interesting to compare with idea-mixing reproduction, although I<br>
still guess this asexual route in this sense would be a minor niche<br>
if viable at all.<br>
