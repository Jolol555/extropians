<p>
There have been some fairly in-depth attempts to train macaques as<br>
aid-animals for humans with sensory and motor handicaps, with only mixed<br>
results, at best.  All the animals had to have their canine teeth removed and<br>
a majority have been unable to maintain their usefulness after puberty.<br>
 (Based on hazy memories from the Primate-Talk list server from about a year<br>
ago.)<br>
<p>
It seems to me that it is the very intelligence of primates that works<br>
against the possibility of using them as domesticated animals.  Having had<br>
the opportunity to observe a prosimian at close quarters for a few years, I<br>
can say that the overpowering curiosity and playfulness of our primate<br>
cousins just isn't compatible with any sort of work habits: They're too<br>
damned smart to be put in harness and, after puberty, can't be said to be<br>
"docile" in any setting but one where humans are willing to accomodate their<br>
wild nature.  Note that the successes with chimps and gorillas in language<br>
study arises from INTENSE social interaction with a few humans who adapt to<br>
the natural behavior patterns of their subjects and have been able to make<br>
the work seem like social play, the thing that all primates are most<br>
interested in.<br>
<p>
Short of genetically engineering some of these basic behavior patterns, I<br>
don't think there's any money to be had in monkey business.<br>
<p>
BTW, remember the genetically engineered "super chimps" in Clarke's short<br>
story about the dirigible?<br>
