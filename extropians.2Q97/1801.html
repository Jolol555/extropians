I also remember studies of individuals who by some fault of nature were<br>
missing non-trivial sections of the human brain (like most of a<br>
hemisphere), but who otherwise were indistinguishable from normally<br>
developed individuals.  <br>
<p>

Sounds like Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, a common symptom of which is<br>
significantly decreased convolution in the brain.  According to my parents<br>
(who live in an area of Alaska where FAS is prevalent in many people),<br>
individuals with FAS can often be distinguished by their behavior.  They<br>
tend to be aggressive and have a hard time conforming to social norms.<br>
Part of this may be a direct result of their significantly hindered ability<br>
to learn.  Although most FAS victims do not have the physical symptoms many<br>
people associate with mental retardation (i.e. Down's Syndrome), most have<br>
unusually low IQs and have an extremely difficult time grasping complex<br>
concepts.  Many never get beyond an elementary school education.<br>
