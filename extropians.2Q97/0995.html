WHile I applaud your appeal to practicality, I might remind you that<br>
many of the inner solar system space projects are now being planned and<br>
funding is being prospected. There are several that could easily take<br>
place within the next ten years. Based on this, I would respectfully<br>
suggest that you reexamine what you regard as practical, near term<br>
extropian goals, projects, and subjects. While personal improvement via<br>
pharmaceuticals or other technology is one goal of ours, remember that<br>
in order to develop the resource base necessary to make such present or<br>
upcoming technologies available to all without destroying our ecology is<br>
much larger than that which is presently available here on earth.<br>
Development of space infrastructure rightfully is a major subject for<br>
extropians to discuss, participate in, and work towards, for this will<br>
make our other dreams that much more possible and affordable.<br>
<p>
WHile we occasionally see people here complaining that all we ever do<br>
here is talk, etc., they need to realize that many of us do more than<br>
talk. Many of us are pursuing educations that will be applicable to the<br>
technologies we discuss, or are actively engaged in extropian related<br>
projects.<br>
<p>
One thing I have NOT seen or have seen little of, which could probably<br>
be of use, is a directory of active extropian projects. One cause of<br>
this is that extropians tend to be rugged individualists, and aren't<br>
into the joiner mentality. Thus they tend to be involved in individual<br>
projects.<br>
<p>
However there are many projects ongoing by non-extropians that fit into<br>
extropian goals. The Artemis Project, First Mellenial FOundation, to<br>
name a few. If there is a need for a project that you see, don't<br>
complain that nobody is doing anything about it. If you think it needs<br>
doing, do it yourself. That is the extropian way. <br>
