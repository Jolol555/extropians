<i>&gt; "It's interesting how many companies in the medical device industries </i><br>
<i>&gt; a quite content selling their products at a very high price, since </i><br>
<i>&gt; the insurance carriers pick up the bills.</i><br>
<p>
This is a real effect, but let's put the blame where it belongs: on<br>
government regulation, not private insurance.  I have worked in the<br>
medical insurance business and have family who still does.  Nothing<br>
would please them more than to be able to give incentives to medical<br>
device makers to reduce their costs; but so long as "Medicare will<br>
pay X", they have no clout.<br>
<p>
A private insurance company would have every reason to embrace,<br>
even subsidize, research on cheaper devices and methods, and would<br>
likely require their use by its subscribers.  The reason they<br>
don't is that industry standards are set by Medicare and other<br>
regulatory agencies with no financial incentive to be efficient.<br>
The government operates under the myth that there is such a thing<br>
as "enough" health care or "sufficient" care, and takes it upon<br>
itself to define that concept, which is completely at odds with<br>
rational economics. <br>
<p>
On top of that there is the government interference in the form<br>
of patent law, which grants monopolies by fiat to manufacturers<br>
of devices that might otherwise have to compete in the free<br>
market withother craftsmen.<br>
<p>
In a free society, health care would be no different from any<br>
other technology product, and the market would drive its prices<br>
down and its quality up just as it does so well for less regulated<br>
markets like computers.<br>
