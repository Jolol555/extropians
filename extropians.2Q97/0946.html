In a message dated 97-05-05 23:25:53 EDT, you write: <br>
 <br>
&lt;&lt; But all I see on web pages and all I read in this mailing list's messages<br>
are theories  <br>
 or general ideas.  I can make theories.  I can have general ideas.  &gt;&gt; <br>
 <br>
I don't understand where you get that idea from.  Everyone in ExI I deal with<br>
has taken personal responsibility to put theories into action.  Most of them<br>
work all day at extropic jobs.  I do.  Some produce Extropian artworks, some<br>
write books about new technology that have stimulated creativity and<br>
invention,  some are setting the framework for new social systems and<br>
experimenting with them.  There is a brain drug clinical trial protocol being<br>
written.  There are people working on improving computer systems hardware and<br>
software, as well as research into cell injury repair and cryonic suspension.<br>
 There are many other examples.  We are in for the long haul not the quick<br>
fix.  Most of these activities will take decades to achieve societal impact. <br>
 <br>
The non-fiction books on the ExI reading list are all practical as far as<br>
I've read -- the nutritional supplement books in particular have dozens of<br>
resources for the drugs.  Even the philosophical books are highly practical.<br>
 I can think of many times they influenced my decisions.  Advancing<br>
philosophy is a step forward in making me a better future person.  Just think<br>
of how pan critical rationalism and Churchland's books can be used on a daily<br>
basis.   <br>
 <br>
Why object to the speculative fiction books and ideas of Extropy?  They are<br>
there to make me more creative.  They stimulate my mind into producing<br>
something useful.  I would not be so involved in nanotechnology advancement<br>
if it where not for Ed Regis and K. Eric Drexler.  Both of them were found<br>
through ExI.  I now work with AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) manufacturers.<br>
  From science fiction -------&gt; to science reality -------&gt; to technological<br>
reality.  That's how it works.  This is very practical in that SF leads to a<br>
change of societies mind from fear of technology -------&gt;  to accepting the<br>
possibility  -------&gt;  to developing the technology  -------&gt;  to using the<br>
technology. <br>
 <br>
BEST DO IT SO principles are all practical as far as I can see.  Take Dynamic<br>
Optimism for example:  That's a way of life in its self.  The greatest force<br>
against scientific and technology is pessimism (only looking at the fear<br>
aspect) and that leads to depression.  Depression is where a person is<br>
mentally paralyzed from doing anything worthwhile.  Anything at all in fact.<br>
 These poor people can't even get out of bed in the morning.   <br>
 <br>
If you just take one of the principles at a time, e.g. Self-Transformation,<br>
and follow the "how to's" advice in the Extropy article(s) _that_ might be<br>
enough make things more practical to you.  I like "DO" (do . . . how<br>
appropriate) Dynamic optimism, myself.   <br>
 <br>
You are right, I book "So You Want To Be An Extropian -- A How To Manual"<br>
would be valuable.  If you want to do something practical, compile and write<br>
this book, (before I do).   For now,  I like Sarah Marr's web site:<br>
