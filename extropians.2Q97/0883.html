<p>
Then it's not a breeder, just a plutonium reactor.<br>
            <br>

<i>        &gt;Getting the plutonium is one thing, but knowing how to build a bomb         </i><br>

<i>        &gt;accomplishment entirely. </i><br>
            <br>
<p>
Making an H bomb would be tricky, but not a simple A bomb, a Physics student <br>
working on a masters degree and a chemist with a little knowledge of  <br>
explosives could do it, if they had the Plutonium. It's really not that hard, <br>
in fact in all the thousands of A bomb tests there has not been one dud, <br>
it's always worked the first time.<br>
<p>
A few years ago I had a sort of morbid curiosity about this, I figured if one  <br>
was going to blow me up one day I wanted to know something about them, <br>
it's amazing what's available. "The Curve of Binding Energy" by John McPhee <br>
was very useful, so was " The Las Alamos Primer" by Robert Serber and <br>
"Mushroom"  by John Aristotle Phillips. Also very interesting was a <br>
thermonuclear weapon maintenance manual, apparently unclassified, that I <br>
found deep in the stacks of a public library.                         <br>
       <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it [a breeder] uses plutonium at an enrichment level of about 40%,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;half that of weapons grade.</i><br>
            <br>
<p>
If you're using U235 then about 80% enrichment is needed before the bomb is  <br>
practical, but if you're using Plutonium 40% would work fine, you'd need <br>
11 kilograms of it, at 20% you'd need about 18 kilograms, at 50% you'd need  <br>
just under 10, and at 100% you'd only need 4.4 kilograms. This assumes that  <br>
the implosion is done crudely and the Plutonium is not compressed beyond its  <br>
normal density, this is never true of in modern weapons so they need less <br>
Plutonium. The critical mass varies inversely with the square of the density  <br>
of the plutonium, but a terrorist might be too dumb to take advantage of this. <br>
Anyway, enriching plutonium is Far easier than enriching Uranium, plutonium  <br>
is a different element so you can use chemical means.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;BUilding a bomb of the simplicity of the Nagasaki weapon requires a         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;minimum of 35 pounds of plutonium,   </i><br>
     <br>
<p>
That was over half a century ago, and far from an ideal design, for example,  <br>
the heavy tamper was placed right next to the Plutonium giving it no place  <br>
to build up speed. As Ted Taylor, the Michelangelo of A bomb designers has  <br>
publicly stated, If you want to drive a nail into a board, do you place the <br>
hammer on the nail and then push?<br>
                     <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;as well as requiring the use of 48 Klystron switches, which are even         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;more highly controlled items than plutonium itself.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Krytrons are used in other things besides bombs, in the oil exploration  <br>
industry for example. The EGG corporation makes them, part number RN22,  <br>
cost 80$.            <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;WHat is a cheap and easy way to make muons?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Aim an ion beam into a target of deuterium or lithium.<br>
