Is anyone else completely disgusted with the estate tax?<br>
<p>
Here in Canada, we use the euphenism "probate tax", but it's still the<br>
same ugly tax.<br>
<p>
How can government profit from it's citizen's demise?  Isn't that just an<br>
incentive for government to kill us off.  Obviously it wouldn't be<br>
advantageous for government to kill off a young worker who is contributing<br>
more income tax that s/he could in estates taxes, but for someone older<br>
who is using up free medical benefits, no longer paying income tax, and<br>
sitting on a large estate, why should government care about these people?<br>
And, more relevant to extropy, why would they care about longevity?  It<br>
seems to me that it would be to the government's advantage to cover-up<br>
and dissuade people from conducting longevity research.<br>
<p>
I wonder if you get an estate tax refund after you are reanimated from<br>
cryonic suspension ;)<br>
