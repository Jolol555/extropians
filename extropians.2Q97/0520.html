&lt;Can anyone direct me to any books on Creativity, brain function  and <br>
Cognition? Anders? Mark?&gt;<br>
<p>
My favorite book on these subjects (it's not extremely technical but <br>
seems to cover all the main issues AND covers all the fringe theories <br>
as well) is Nick Herbert's _Elemental Mind_.  The book is a few year's <br>
old but I think it's still on the shelves in most large book stores <br>
(at least in the U.S.).<br>
<p>
Here's a couple of extract from my notebooks:<br>
<p>
01/14/95. In ch.1 of "Elemental Mind" Nick Herbert gives the best <br>
explicit description of the various philosophical schools of thought <br>
that I have ever seen. He calls this the "psi/phi", or mind over <br>
matter problem, distinguishing Dualistic models of consciousness, <br>
which maintain "that mind and matter are essentially different kinds <br>
of essences", where you have epiphenominalists who say "mind is a mere <br>
byproduct completely subject to matter's motion ... The switch <br>
controls the light; the light never controls the switch", and animists <br>
who "imagine that behind every material motion lies an invisible <br>
spiritual cause", and interactionalists who believe that "neither mind <br>
nor matter dominates"; and, Monistic models of consciousness believing <br>
that "matter is all that there is", e.g., William Uttal: "Mind is to <br>
the nervous system as rotation is to the wheel", which subdivides into <br>
reductionist materialists who "resemble animists" by believing that <br>
"virtually any mechanical motion results in some kind of inner <br>
experience", emergent materialists who "also believe that <br>
consciousness is a wholly mechanical property of matter, but that only <br>
very complex systems possess it", and idealists (like Roger Penrose) <br>
who feel that "the existence of inner experiences is undeniable, but <br>
... the existence of the external world is not so certain"; finally, <br>
there is neutral monism that "posits the existence of a single <br>
substance possessing both mental and physical attributes." Herbert <br>
goes on to posit 13 criteria that successful consciousness theories <br>
must explain: mind links, mind maps, artificial awareness, quantity of <br>
mind, quality of mind, attention mechanisms, sense of self, <br>
personality, free will, death, mind reach, evolution, and surprise.<br>
<p>
01/29/95. In ch.10 of "Elemental Mind", describing the brain as a <br>
quantum reality receiver, Nick Herbert relates the following subjects: <br>
John von Neumann was the father of quantum consciousness models; <br>
Eccles proposal that synapses serve as quantum-actuated microsites <br>
where the immaterial mind exerts its will on the material brain; Bass <br>
&amp; Donald's model of "the quantum mechanics of warm, wet switches" <br>
asserted that "a neuron's ionic channels are the quantum entry points <br>
for consciousness"; E.H. Walker's "flawed but detailed" theories of <br>
quantum synaptic tunneling creating "a kind of 'second nervous system' <br>
operating by completely quantum rules and acting in parallel with the <br>
conventional nervous system [which] mediates unconscious data <br>
processing"; Penrose's claim that we need a theory of correct quantum <br>
gravity to collapse the wave function has the flaw that the Planck <br>
mass, at which quantum states are collapsed to classical states, "is <br>
embarrassingly large" [about the mass of a flea]; In other words, many <br>
objects with large mass could exhibit quantum uncertainties; <br>
Bose-Einstein condensates, systems where the particles act in concert <br>
to generate quantum behavior on the macroscopic scale, underly the <br>
'ferroelectric' proposals of I.N Walker and his wife, Danah Zollar who <br>
"sees neither matter nor mind as primary in nature. Rather each serves <br>
as a context for the other's development"; Greg Keith (a "technoerotic <br>
poet") says "and the I is only an index into life ... I, the constant <br>
truth that controls our innermost loop. The massless I, dilating at <br>
dreamspeed, grows coextensive with more and more selves."<br>
<p>
And there's quite a bit more.  In particular, Herbert devotes an <br>
entire chapter to James Culbertson's "spacetime reductive materialism" <br>
theories of consciousness. I made a lengthy post last fall excerpting <br>
some of this which is in the archives at<br>
