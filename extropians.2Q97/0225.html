<i>&gt; I have seen no references to any negative side effects for DMAE. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Remember, the result of taking DMAE is to increase the amount of </i><br>

<p>
	I'm not certain that this is entirely true.  It does operate in<br>
the cholinergic system, but I don't believe that it is ever synthesized<br>
into choline, I believe it is synthesized directly to acetylcholine.  That<br>
is why DMAE is better than choline, they have the same function, but DMAE<br>
more effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; AND choline is a natural substance </i><br>

<i>&gt; like a 'vitamin supplement' for the brain.</i><br>
<p>
	Many vitamin supplements can cause harm.  Look to ascorbic acid as<br>
one examample of a highly used yet still potentially dangerous supplement.<br>
To much ascorbic acid can cause kidney stones in the long run, and ulcers<br>
as well.<br>
	Just because it is "natural" doesn't make it safe...<br>
	I do agree in regards to the safety of DMAE however, I have not<br>
seen any reports of negative side affects.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; DMAE is often combined with B vitamins in </i><br>
<i>&gt; prepared capsules.  </i><br>
<p>
	B-5 is the most crucial.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For stronger effects, I think the recommendation </i><br>
<i>&gt; 300 mg per day in three doses.  </i><br>
<p>
	I believe that is correct.<br>
