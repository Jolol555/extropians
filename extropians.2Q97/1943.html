In a message dated 97-06-21 00:25:43 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  That is a good point. Placing things on a line tends to suggest a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  dichotomy. It would be better to see it as a complete graph, where</i><br>
<i>&gt;  each mental ability forms a vertex...</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<p>
aarrrgghhh.... placing things on a continuum, is what I meant by sliding<br>
scale, not a LINE... arrgghhhh, this debate shit makes me crazy . maybe it's<br>
just cuz I suck at it!<br>
Oh., BTW - I have been acused of being emotional, um...<br>
- is that something bad?<br>
<p>
<p>
Ok, I am not making myself clear: <br>
imagine a sliding scale of thought in time, not in space...<br>
Imagine perceptions and thoughts as a Stream, not isolated bits of<br>
information or data.<br>
Now:<br>
In this stream, or continuum, we move through our day  - thinking.<br>
In other words, we slide from a high focus logical state: deductive, linear,<br>
used for say, a math problem... then perceptions influence your "thought<br>
stream" - say , a noise behind you...you look behind you and gather some<br>
fresh perceptions, your mental focus slides into a different focus, - your<br>
focus governs the relationship to your thoughts.<br>
<p>
Some people, some of the time, percieve the world in a way that fastens on<br>
the details, clipping out interesting detail of a scene, such observers<br>
question and wondr abotu the details. This type of person may go after the<br>
data, for closer inspection.<br>
Some people, some of the time, percieve in a "diffuse "way, simply watching<br>
the world go by... more likey to notive mood and ambiance than to fasten<br>
analytically on particular details. Ths person will be more passive, rather<br>
than go hunting about the landscape huntng for points of interest.<br>
everyone experiences both, and will recognize some aspects of themslves at<br>
least in some measure...<br>
<p>
One of these is a high focus state and the other low...<br>
Higher focus people are more comfortable camping out for sustained periods at<br>
the the higher ends of the spectrum. Lowere focus personalities aren't.<br>
<p>
<p>
When you believe thoughts are bits of data points, then there is a dichotomy,<br>
because you will see it as a bunch of points on a graph paper... <br>
If you see us as a stream, it will be more of a pattern...<br>
