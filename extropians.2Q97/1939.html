This is kind of a tangent, but I thought I'd bring it up.<br>
<p>
Often I find I begin to appreciate an artist I didn't originally like once I<br>
understand where they're coming from.  One thing I almost hate is when I read<br>
a foreword to a collection of a comic strip I don't like (yeah, I know, I<br>
read everything).  Often afterwards I start appreciating the strip!<br>
 Sometimes this almost makes me feel used.<br>
<p>
I've had similar experiences with my favorite art, music.  Schubert was once<br>
no big deal to me.  But then I got a music professor who explained about<br>
Schubert's playing with keys and some interesting deliberate breaking of<br>
compositional rules.  For example, in one song, Schubert deliberately makes a<br>
beginner's error of going to the dominant too soon to create an atmosphere of<br>
somebody who doesn't know what they're doing (which is the point of that part<br>
of the song).  Now I love Schubert.<br>
<p>
"Modern" art (which is not really modern anymore - we need a new name)<br>
generally leaves me cold, no matter how well I understand it.  John Cage can<br>
be interesting, but I don't think he should be listened to - his pieces are<br>
better appreciated as visual or conceptual art.  Some abstract painting<br>
(complex semi-random smears/streaks/etc), however, I now like, as I realized<br>
it's very similar to the appearance of polished stone.  "Fantasy stone", I<br>
call it.  Indeed, the tile on my floor (a mid-grade commercial) could pass<br>
for an abstract painting if you hung it on the wall.<br>
