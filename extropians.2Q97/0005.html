<i>&gt; &gt; With all due respect Greg, I think that you have a bit of denial here as</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to what Alife feels. Since we are simulating creatures of instinct,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; which react to stimuli, then, Alife has really no distinction from</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; biolife.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A computer cannot say something feels good in the way I can say such. </i><br>
<p>
At this point in time it cannot, only because our ability to program<br>
such has not reached the level of sophistication of the human being.<br>
<p>
It<br>
<i>&gt; can analyze data inputted to it and come to the purely abstract</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion that according to all its data this incoming data should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered a "good" feeling.</i><br>
<p>
When it comes down to it, your own feelings are just as abstract as the<br>
computers, relative to everyone else.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But it is not feeling the data.</i><br>
<p>
You are not feeling it feeling the data.<br>
<p>
 It is just<br>
<i>&gt; running subroutines and more subroutines.</i><br>
<p>
As do you when you receive sensory stimuli. With proper reprogramming,<br>
you can be made to find pleasure in pain, joy in sorrow, and art in<br>
ugliness.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; All the computer has done is</i><br>
<i>&gt; label the data. </i><br>
<p>
As do you label sensory stimuli as "good" or "bad", "pain" or "pleasure"<br>
as you have been programmed to do.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;It has given the data a name and that is it. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer can then be programmed to blow bells and whistles but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer will in no way ENJOY blowing bells and whistles. </i><br>
<p>
You are not participating in its own joy, just as you are not<br>
participating in mine. What is the difference in the ego separation<br>
between you and I and a computer programmed with human level<br>
conciousness?<br>
<p>
It just does<br>
<i>&gt; it. There is no way I could scare my computer, there is no way I could</i><br>
<i>&gt; anger my computer, there is no way I could embarass my computer, there</i><br>
<i>&gt; is no way I can give my computer pleasure or pain, no matter what data I</i><br>
<i>&gt; send it or in what fashion I handle it. How is this so difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand?</i><br>
<p>
Only because you are only existing in the now. You automatically assume<br>
because your computer is not programmed to do these things now, that it<br>
will never be programmed to do these things. There is your error.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Animals merely react to input via sensory nerves as pre</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; programmed by evolved instincts.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not true. There is this thing called training or learning which</i><br>
<i>&gt; allows us to modify our programming.</i><br>
<p>
Exactly my point, so you acknowledge that we, as animals, operate<br>
conciously as reactions to sensory stimuli and analyses of same.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; A-Greg will debate with Greg over who is real</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and who is not real......</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sure, we will be able to debate all day long. I will be emotively</i><br>
<i>&gt; affected by the debate and A-Greg will not be.</i><br>
<p>
In your opinion, not in his....<br>
