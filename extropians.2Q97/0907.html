<i>&gt;         &gt;A breeder can be set to produce excess plutonium, produce no excess,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;or to burn up excess plutonium.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Then it's not a breeder, just a plutonium reactor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;Getting the plutonium is one thing, but knowing how to build a bomb</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;that will actually explode using only  9 pounds is another level of</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;accomplishment entirely.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Making an H bomb would be tricky, but not a simple A bomb, a Physics student</i><br>
<i>&gt; working on a masters degree and a chemist with a little knowledge of</i><br>
<i>&gt; explosives could do it, if they had the Plutonium. It's really not that hard,</i><br>
<i>&gt; in fact in all the thousands of A bomb tests there has not been one dud,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's always worked the first time.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A few years ago I had a sort of morbid curiosity about this, I figured if one</i><br>
<i>&gt; was going to blow me up one day I wanted to know something about them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's amazing what's available. "The Curve of Binding Energy" by John McPhee</i><br>
<i>&gt; was very useful, so was " The Las Alamos Primer" by Robert Serber and</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Mushroom"  by John Aristotle Phillips. Also very interesting was a</i><br>
<i>&gt; thermonuclear weapon maintenance manual, apparently unclassified, that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; found deep in the stacks of a public library.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;it [a breeder] uses plutonium at an enrichment level of about 40%,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;half that of weapons grade.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you're using U235 then about 80% enrichment is needed before the bomb is</i><br>
<i>&gt; practical, but if you're using Plutonium 40% would work fine, you'd need</i><br>
<i>&gt; 11 kilograms of it, at 20% you'd need about 18 kilograms, at 50% you'd need</i><br>
<i>&gt; just under 10, and at 100% you'd only need 4.4 kilograms. This assumes that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the implosion is done crudely and the Plutonium is not compressed beyond its</i><br>
<i>&gt; normal density, this is never true of in modern weapons so they need less</i><br>
<i>&gt; Plutonium. The critical mass varies inversely with the square of the density</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the plutonium, but a terrorist might be too dumb to take advantage of this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anyway, enriching plutonium is Far easier than enriching Uranium, plutonium</i><br>
<i>&gt; is a different element so you can use chemical means.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;BUilding a bomb of the simplicity of the Nagasaki weapon requires a</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;minimum of 35 pounds of plutonium,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That was over half a century ago, and far from an ideal design, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the heavy tamper was placed right next to the Plutonium giving it no place</i><br>
<i>&gt; to build up speed. As Ted Taylor, the Michelangelo of A bomb designers has</i><br>
<i>&gt; publicly stated, If you want to drive a nail into a board, do you place the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hammer on the nail and then push?</i><br>
<p>
The plutonium bomb used was not a tamper type, that was the uranium bomb<br>
used on Hiroshima. The one used on Nagasaki was plutonium, and used a<br>
sphere of TNT charges. Your original comment was concerning the lack of<br>
security with so much plutonium around. Given this, one must expect that<br>
those seeking to take advantage of this would be terrorists who not only<br>
are not known for their technical sophistication, but also for not<br>
taking proper safety measures. One would expect them to make as cheap<br>
and easy a bomb as possible, thus the most technically simple types<br>
would be those used. One would also expect them to poison themselves<br>
with radioactivity while in the process of putting such a device<br>
together.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;as well as requiring the use of 48 Klystron switches, which are even</i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;more highly controlled items than plutonium itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Krytrons are used in other things besides bombs, in the oil exploration</i><br>
<i>&gt; industry for example. The EGG corporation makes them, part number RN22,</i><br>
<i>&gt; cost 80$.</i><br>
<p>
Excuse me? SUre there are similar components used for explosives use,<br>
but they have nowhere near the same tolerance level. Your 80 cent<br>
component cannot be used for the detonation sphere of a plutonium bomb.<br>
Those that are of proper performance are highly controlled munitions.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         &gt;WHat is a cheap and easy way to make muons?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Aim an ion beam into a target of deuterium or lithium.</i><br>

ANy more specific data or info sources?<br>
