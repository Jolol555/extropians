	Recently we finished reading the 1200 page tome "Chronicles of the 20th<br>
Century.  We used it as a bathroom book, so each trip to the John allowed<br>
us to read a day by day account of what the world, especially the United<br>
States, was doing.  It is amazing how what was being done by various<br>
governments then would be unacceptable today.  In many ways we "growing<br>
up".  But throughout history there have been people who want "a piece of<br>
the action" without contributing to the action.  Someone controls a pass to<br>
the market and if you want to take your goods to the market you must pay<br>
them in order to do so, etc.  Over and over again the same scenario is<br>
repeated; those merchants who are established want to prevent competition<br>
and/or gain a special privelage and they use government to do so.  All the<br>
wars are just organized gangs of thieves using the people as cannon fodder<br>
so the established merchants will prosper even more.  Until there is a<br>
"Seperation of State and Market" this scenario will continue.  We may not<br>
have wars as intense as before (the establishment could actually get hurt<br>
the next time around), but we will have trade wars or government<br>
regulations to achieve the same end.  Keeping in mind the real purpose of<br>
government (to protect the established businesses), we may wish to<br>
reexamine history, if necessary, to see that Communism and Capitalism are<br>
both ideas which function without the State.  When the State is involved in<br>
either of these ideas the ideas become corrupted.  There has never been an<br>
armed struggle between these two ideas, only struggle between groups<br>
wanting a piece of the action.  Merchantilism (with a small group of<br>
wealthy merchants) called Capitalism has been on one side; Socialism, (with<br>
a small group of politicians) called Communism has been on the other side. <br>
Both groups were greatly enriched by using the State.  Now there is such a<br>
mix of Mechantilism and Socialism that there is not much difference between<br>
various countries, only in degree.  Socialism appears to be the modern<br>
version of the Roman circuses; give the masses something to keep them<br>
satisfied while you are stealing from them.<br>
	The United States did not go to war in 1917 to keep the World safe for<br>
Democracy.  Our excuse for getting into that war was to bring up, on April<br>
6th 1917, the sinking of the Lusitania on May 15th,1915.  The United States<br>
did not go to war in 1941 to keep Herr Hitler from running Europe, they<br>
were attacked by Japan, an ally of Germany.  Germany had a free hand to<br>
occupy Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Holland, France, Yugoslavia and<br>
Greece by June 1941.  Their ally Italy, and "fellow fascist" Franco in<br>
Spain pretty much put most of Europe into the same camp.  If the U.S. was<br>
trying to stop Hitler from "running Europe", they would not have stood by<br>
while he marched into Prague on the Ides of March, 1939, or when he invaded<br>
Poland on September 30th of the same year.  The Second World War allowed<br>
the United States to rise from the Depression and to allow government to<br>
interfere in peoples lives as they had never done before; all with the<br>
excuse that "we are at war".<br>
	With the seperation of the State and the Market, the causes of war would<br>
cease, including the War on Drugs and other victimless crimes.  Governments<br>
would cease to be a tool of the "established businesses", donations would<br>
dry up, most regulations would be scuttled, and people would be more in<br>
charge of their own lives.  Governments would naturally shrink drastically.<br>
	A few years ago an economist won the Pulitzer for showing the correlation<br>
between government regulation and efficiency of the economy; any<br>
interference makes it less efficient; the more interference the more<br>
inefficient it becomes.  So why is interference tolerated?  Tradition.  And<br>
we all know that "Tradition is easier than thinking."  Let's hear it one<br>
more time for Seperation of State and Market.<br>
