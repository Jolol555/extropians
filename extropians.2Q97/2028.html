Dear Hagbard and other fellow Extropians,<br>
<p>
Full participation should mean more than being fully informed.<br>
It should mean being fully educated in reasoning and developing the<br>
understanding required to make careful, critical, value judgements based on<br>
highly developed knowledge, skills and abilities.<br>
<p>
Ultimately, dear Hagbard, we should all be part of the ruling class.<br>
<p>
A.M. Genen <br>
