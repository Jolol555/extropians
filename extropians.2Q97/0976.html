The Craving Brain <br>
by Ronald A. Ruden, Marcia Byalick<br>
<p>
Is a book I highly recommend for several reasons. On the personal<br>
level he is the personal Dr. for myself and for Perry Metzger.<br>
<p>
It is a very interesting book clearly for the subject matter it covers<br>
but also for the way the information has been presented.<br>
<p>
The basic premise of the book is how certain Nuro chemicals can<br>
trigger addiction of any kind. Dr. Ruden takes a very evolutionary<br>
view of things. For example he explains that 12 Step programs work,<br>
basically because they trigger the Nuro chemical response that mammals<br>
and other animals would get when in a "herd;" he may or may not be<br>
correct but it is a more philosophically pleasing answer than it works<br>
because someone invoked their higher power. He also touches on some<br>
things which give sound scientific basis to the Extropian principal of<br>
Dynamic Optimism.<br>
<p>
The book is divided into two sections. A very easy to read six<br>
chapters that details Dr. Ruden's Point of View (POV). Then there is<br>
an other six chapters on the very same topics but with a more<br>
scientific approach, far less easy to read but with significantly more<br>
information. The type of information an Extropian might like to sink<br>
his or her intellectual teeth into. I think more books should be<br>
written this way; you get easy to read and you don't have to leave out<br>
any of the hard details.<br>
<p>
It is available via WWW.amazon.com and from other fine book sellers.<br>
