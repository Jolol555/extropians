I thoroughly enjoyed these urls, this is honestly Good News. I wonder<br>
however, whether a different brand of architecture might not offer a<br>
better price-performance ratio than hypercubed 100 via MBit tx, PVM/PMI'd<br>
Linux boxes. <br>
<p>
The most natural topology for MD and lattice inspired runs is a<br>
lattice/grid. The development has swung full circle: after the demise of<br>
the venerable British transputer we now have diverse SuperDSPs with links,<br>
noticeable numerical performance and lots of on-die core. <br>
<p>
Consider the Analog Devices SHARC: a $100 chip in large quantities. It is<br>
a 40 MIPS/120 MFLOPS, 1-4 MBIT on-die dual-ported SRAM 6 high-speed links<br>
DSP. COAST SRAM modules have dropped down in price sufficiently that a<br>
node can easily feature few MByte SRAM with 12-15 ns latency. TI's new<br>
SuperDSP offers 1.2-1.6 GOPS performance, and 1 MBit core on-die, though<br>
the first family member does not feature any high-speed links. <br>
<p>
A 64-node superDSP cluster, assuming $200/node would fit in a mini tower<br>
cabinet, and offer a _dedicated_ performance rivalling that of many<br>
supercomputers for just 13 k$; make it 15 k$ for a Linux box to do I/O and<br>
visualization. In case of a SHARC 64-node cluster we'd get 7 GFLOPS, a TI<br>
would peak at 70 BOPS (!), making the latter's lack of an FPU negligeable<br>
(one can do plenty of scientific things with scaled integers).  This<br>
numerical performance is a lot for 15 k$ -- and it's available for a<br>
single user, for months if this needs be. <br>
<p>
This stuff won't run UNIX, but there are now several DSP OSses around, <br>
and message-passing code should be easy enough to isolate to make porting <br>
to other platforms easy. You see, I am obviously very excited about this.<br>
<p>
Now a question: is anyone already doing modeling on such beasties? If no,<br>
is anyone going to? Is anyone aware of cheap multi-DSP cards for ISA/PCI<br>
bus, coming with documentation and a compiler? I will search on the web,<br>
however I'd like to first sample experiences of people who already worked <br>
with above boards. <br>
<p>
Please answer, I will summarize to the lists.<br>
