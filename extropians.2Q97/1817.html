I don't think your model needs to assume any real evolutionary<br>
advantage to this behavior/mental model. Animals build simple mental<br>
models of their environment, and it is likely their parents (and<br>
other friendly animals) are included (there is an evolutionary<br>
advantage to have such a model during *childhood*). As the animal<br>
grows up and leaves its parents, the mental model remains and under<br>
some circumstances it becomes actual even if there are no parents<br>
present. It doesn't give a big advantage, or a big disadvantage, so<br>
evolution will not lead to some system making animals forget their<br>
parents explicitly.<br>
<p>
Actually, I like Sasha's model, it makes a lot of sense although I<br>
think he is overestimating the evolutionary pressure on having the<br>
"Big Helper".<br>
