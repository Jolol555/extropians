Scientists Confident of Life on Jupiter Moon<br>
<p>
PASADENA, Calif. (Reuter) - Space scientists said Wednesday they were <br>
confident life existed in the muddy waters of<br>
one of Jupiter's moons. <br>
<p>
"I am sure there's life there," John Delaney of the University of <br>
Washington said in a reference to the Jovian moon<br>
Europa. Delaney and the other experts spoke at a news briefing detailing <br>
results of pictures from the Galileo probe. <br>
<p>
Pictures of Europa sent back by Galileo after its closest flyby of the <br>
moon in February and released by the National<br>
Aeronautics and Space Administration Wednesday showed a red-colored sea <br>
with a crust of ice about three feet thick in<br>
which huge icebergs several miles across were floating, the scientists <br>
said. <br>
<p>
The images were taken as Galileo was 363 miles from Europa. <br>
<p>
Talking to reporters at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the scientists <br>
said they believed all the ingredients for creating<br>
and sustaining life forms existed in Europa's waters. <br>
<p>
Delaney, a professor of oceanology, said he and other scientists believed <br>
the waters under the ice crust were being<br>
warmed by volcanic activity and undersea research on Earth had shown that <br>
"volcanic activity supports life without<br>
sunlight." <br>
<p>
Richard Terrile of the JPL, a planetary scientist, said he believed there <br>
was organic matter in sediment at the bottom of<br>
Europa's ocean and pointed out: "On Earth, these same ingredients in a <br>
million years gave presence to life." <br>
<p>
Terrile said he would like to see a "machine exploration" of Europa <br>
during a future unmanned probe to the moon in the<br>
hope of confirming his beliefs. <br>
<p>
Delaney said he was "very excited" by Galileo's pictures. "The bottom <br>
line is, it's about life. The discovery of life on<br>
another planet will surpass anything that has ever taken place in human <br>
history," he said. <br>
<p>
He added that volcanic activity not only sustained life but encouraged <br>
it, saying when a volcano erupted under the ocean<br>
on Earth it caused bacteria to "bloom at a massive level." <br>
<p>
In an effort to bolster their life-in-outer-space theory, scientists and <br>
engineers from around the world were meeting in<br>
Pasadena on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss an exploration of Lake <br>
Vostok, a subglacial lake under the ice in<br>
Antarctica which they believe has conditions similar to Europa's sea. <br>
<p>
Michael Carr of the United States Geological Survey said there was <br>
evidence of movement and rotation by the icebergs<br>
which could not be explained by wind as Europa is in a vacuum. "The <br>
plausible cause for this motion is traction below<br>
which implies liquid below. <br>
<p>
Dr Paul Geissler of the University of Arizona said the pictures showed <br>
the sea as a red-brown area on the surface of<br>
Europa. He speculated that the red-brown material in the waters indicated <br>
it was a "muddy sea," while Max Coon, a<br>
scientist with NorthWest Research Associates, Inc., concluded after <br>
studying the pictures that, "The ice features here (on<br>
Earth) look very, very like the ones on Europa." <br>
<p>
Oceanographer Clark Chapman of the Southwest Research Institute said he <br>
believed Europa was still developing and<br>
the ice crust was about one million years old, "a mere day in geological <br>
terms." <br>
<p>
The scientists, who make up the Galileo imaging team and whose task it is <br>
to interpret the pictures and data sent back<br>
from the spacecraft, also said it appeared that the ice crust was slowly <br>
melting because of the warmer waters below<br>
which were being heated by volcanic activity. <br>
<p>
Galileo was launched by the shuttle Atlantis in October, 1989 and arrived <br>
at Jupiter to begin its exploration of the planet<br>
and its moons in December of 1995. <br>
