Welcome to the wonderful world of Science, it's not nice, it's not polite,  <br>
nothing is more fulfilling to a Scientist than smashing somebody else's <br>
theory into a quivering bloody heap begging for mercy. Take no prisoners is <br>
the rallying cry, look for the slightest logical flaw, the smallest possible <br>
crack, then use it to pry open the entire theory and expose the disgusting <br>
stupidity inside for all the world to see. And that is EXACTLY what they <br>
should do because nearly all theories are wrong. The few ideas that survive <br>
this brutal process are possibly true and certainly tough as nails, they have <br>
to be. Historically one of the very toughest of these is the law of <br>
conservation of energy, it has withstood fierce attacks by brilliant minds <br>
and come out without a scratch. If it were untrue we'd need to throw all the <br>
Physics books written in the last 300 years in the garbage, if the evidence <br>
was strong enough I'd be willing to do just that and start from square one, <br>
but it would take one hell of a lot more that some Bozo saying "Trust me. <br>
Why would I lie?"<br>
<p>
Perpetual motion machines are a dime a dozen, crackpots have been making them <br>
for thousands of years, life is short and I see no reason to spend any more <br>
time studying this one than the millions of other such designs.<br>
