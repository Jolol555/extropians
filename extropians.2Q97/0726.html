John K. Clark was the last to evidence extreme intolerance by writing:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; You have to understand, with all the amazing discoveries in this incredible</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; age it's difficult for even the best of us to keep up with it all,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and we just don't have time for such ..., how  can I put it politely...,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; male bovine excrement.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Mike Rose displayed a fair degree of self-control in responding:<br>
<i>&gt;I understand. Good luck to 'the best of you' in deciding what isn't.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Since I first joined the Extropians list I have had to be disabused of a<br>
number of fallacious notions.  General appeals to laws-of-whatever didn't<br>
help.  Only being taken step by step through the process of determining<br>
that 0 did not equal 1, and being shown where the error crept into the<br>
proof that it did, allowed me to see that the impossible actually wasn't<br>
true.  The Monty Hall door-choosing probability problem (on which I think<br>
some people disagree to this day) also comes to mind, and there are others<br>
that don't.<br>
<p>
The point is that saying that something "violates the laws of physics"<br>
doesn't convince people -- being open to input that seems to violate the<br>
known laws is what allows people to discover new ones.  And calling the<br>
people names *certainly* doesn't convince them.  Look at the proof<br>
yourself, find the erroneous step, point it out, and explain where<br>
necessary.  Just saying "there's an error there somewhere" is either<br>
presumptuous, naive, or lazy, depending on the attitude with which it's<br>
said.  Most things are obvious once you understand them.<br>
<p>
If you can't calmly convince a single intelligent and sympathetic person<br>
of where the law of conservation of energy is violated in this instance,<br>
how do you expect to convince (mostly less intelligent and less<br>
sympathetic) people of things more important to you?<br>
<p>
Every time I see misunderstanding handled in such a dismissive and<br>
contemptuous way, I think I gain further insight into why Extropianism<br>
(with its cousin Libertarianism) hasn't taken the world by storm.<br>
<p>
For people who wonder what the foofaraw is all about, and how people get<br>
such ideas, check out:<br>

and for something somewhat more likely to work (?), try:<br>

I just told AltaVista to find "car NEAR water NEAR fuel NEAR hydrogen" for<br>
the first one, and "car NEAR water NEAR power" for the second.  Not very<br>
good queries, but I came up with them in under a minute.<br>
<p>
The world would probably be improved by a Web page debunking some of the<br>
claims in the first one, without reference to name-calling.  I'd write<br>
one myself, except that I don't know my physics well enough to explain<br>
the matter clearly.<br>
