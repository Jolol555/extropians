The Six Essentials? Minimal Requirements for the Darwinian<br>
Bootstrapping of Quality by William H. Calvin (40Kb)<br>
<p>
Selectionism emphasizes carving patterns, memes remind us of minimal<br>
replicable patterns, but a full-fledged Darwinian process needs six<br>
essential ingredients to keep going, to recursively bootstrap quality<br>
from rude beginnings. While there may be situations ("sparse<br>
Darwinism") in which a reduced number suffice, another five<br>
ingredients, while not essential, greatly enhance the speed and<br>
stability of a Darwinian process. While our best examples are drawn<br>
from species evolution, the immune response, and evolutionary<br>
epistemology, the Darwinian process may well be a major law of the<br>
universe, right up there with chemical bonds as a prime generator of<br>
interesting combinations that discover stratified stabilities. <br>

Cultural r/k Selection by Agner Fog (56Kb)<br>
<p>
A new model of cultural r/k-selection is introduced. This model, which<br>
provides a classification of cultural processes based on the factors<br>
that influence memetic fitness rather than on selection mechanisms,<br>
predicts that cultural evolution will go in different ways depending<br>
on the balance between internal and external conflicts of a society. A<br>
society dominated by external conflicts or war will evolve in a<br>
direction called regal, whereas a society in a peaceful or sparsely<br>
populated area will evolve in the opposite direction, called kalyptic.<br>
The regal or kalyptic characteristics of a society influence the<br>
evolution in many areas of culture, including religion, political<br>
structure, art, music, etc.<br>

The Origin and Evolution of Culture and Creativity by Liane Gabora<br>
(115Kb)<br>
<p>
Like the information patterns that evolve through biological<br>
processes, mental representations, or memes, evolve through adaptive<br>
exploration and transformation of an information space through<br>
variation, selection, and transmission. Since unlike genes, memes do<br>
not come packaged with instructions for their replication, our brains<br>
do it for them, strategically, guided by a fitness landscape that<br>
reflects both internal drives and a worldview that is continually<br>
updated through meme assimilation. This paper presents a model for how<br>
an individual becomes a meme-evolving agent via the emergence of an<br>
autocatalytic network of sparse, distributed memories, and discusses<br>
implications for complex, creative thought processes and why they are<br>
unique to humans. Memetics can do more than account for the spread of<br>
catchy tunes; it can pave the way for the kind of overarching<br>
framework for the humanities that the first form of evolution has<br>
provided for the biological sciences.<br>

Macromemetics: Towards a Framework for the Re-unification of<br>
Philosophy by Derek Gatherer (66Kb)<br>
<p>
The review of the philosophical and scientific antecedents of memetics<br>
by Elan Moritz [27] is extended to cover 20th century philosophy. It<br>
is proposed that `macromemetics', ie. the study of the evolution of<br>
entire meme pools, is in many respects a similar enterprise to that<br>
attempted by the cultural evolutionist school of anthropology which<br>
flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Memetics may<br>
provide a new, and more rigorously Darwinian, slant to this rather<br>
neglected branch of anthropology. Furthermore, it is proposed that<br>
much of the terminology and conceptual apparatus of memetics may be<br>
reconciled with that used by recent Continental philosophers in their<br>
studies of culture, thus suggesting a possible Darwinian framework for<br>
the re-unification of Western philosophy.<br>
