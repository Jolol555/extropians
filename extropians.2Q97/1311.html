In a message dated 24/05/97  01:21:44, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; A while ago I started telling people about my idea's to engineer bee's to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; make alternative food products.  Now they all think i'm crazy!</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;In that case they are unusually unimaginative.</i><br>
<p>
It always suprises me how unimaginative many people are.  Unfortunately,<br>
there are a lot of people out there who, not only refuse to *believe* in new<br>
technologies (Nanotechnology being their favorite disbelief), but don't even<br>
relise life exists beyond their own homes.  Even more unfortunately, I seem<br>
to be related to all of them!<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure what alternative food products you are thinking of, but I</i><br>
definitely<br>
<i>&gt;think bees could be used for producing a lot of stuff.</i><br>
<p>
Jelly, Peanut Butter (aided by worms).  Maybe assembling microelectronics<br>
(ants could be good for this).  It may even be possible to create a<br>
'computer-ecology'.  Birds tell you when you have mail, Infomation grows on<br>
tree's and Rabbits act as know-bots (at this point you probably understand<br>
why many people think the idea is 'crazy').  Certainly takes ubiquitous<br>
computing to a strange new level.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I wonder what kind of scavengers might work in a apartment to clean</i><br>
<i>&gt;it up?  Cockroaches and ants seem to be obvious choices, but are</i><br>
<i>&gt;there others?</i><br>
<p>
Have you ever seen the french movie "City of Lost Children".  They have a<br>
flea, trained to be an assasin.  There is already research into<br>
'remote-control' cockroaches that can (theoritcally) be used for spying, etc.<br>
 Experiments into using dolphins as weapons have been going for a long time.<br>
