Minority, isn't that pretty much everyone transhuman? ; - )<br>
META:<br>
Of those who benefit, a certain number of them will be those who travel or<br>
are often too busy to write. Those  who have the luxury of time, and post<br>
often will have to limit, others will have more than they use.<br>
IMO you have no control over quality, but the system makes for LESS posting<br>
 in general, limiting the list by numbers of words alone, if I am reading it<br>
correctly.<br>
Question: When I  return from a business trip or an extended work schedule,<br>
will <br>
I have a lot of tokens stacked up? Or do they expire....<br>
