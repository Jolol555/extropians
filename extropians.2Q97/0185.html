<i>&gt; I was complaining about our society in general, not about this forum</i><br>

I fancy that the popularity of _The_Rules_ stems from the uncertainties many<br>
women feel about their sex roles.  I believe that this best-selling book's<br>
chief purpose is telling women how to find husbands.  I skimmed a little of it<br>
months ago; my impression was that the book prescribes dating in which the<br>
woman's company is a prize the man wins by proving his worth to her in<br>
specified ways.  Its "one size fits all" method and insistence on<br>
old-fashioned sex roles makes it easy for self-consciously up-to-date folks to<br>
dismiss the book, but its sales suggest that it fills a need.<br>
<p>
The writers might make their title a brand name:  THE RULES (TM).  I imagine a<br>
series of _Rules_ for different market segments--e.g., black yuppies,<br>
lower-middle-class fundamentalists, etc.--whose needs would be better served<br>
by more specialized mate search algorithms.  Male and female versions might be<br>
made for each heterosexual market segment.  People could tell each other which<br>
version of _The_Rules_ they'd chosen to follow so that potential dates would<br>
know what to expect.  (Such allegiances are a very weak version of the phyles<br>
in Neal Stephenson's _The_Diamond_Age_.)<br>
<p>
In the modern American social flux, many people don't "know their places" and<br>
have inherited inadequate mores.  Inventing customs from scratch exposes one<br>
to the perils of innovation.  _The_Rules_ and, in other areas of life,<br>
etiquette books allow the safety of emulation.<br>
