Robin Hanson, hanson@hss.caltech.edu, writes:<br>
<i>&gt; Nodland describes the effect as the sort of thing produced by magnetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; fields, but dismisses mag field correlations on billion light year</i><br>
<i>&gt; scales as improbable, and so opts for saying the speed of light is</i><br>
<i>&gt; anisotropic.  Having just heard a talk here at Caltech on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mysteriously large strength of most large scale (including galactic)</i><br>
<i>&gt; magnetic fields, I'm inclined to guess that there really are billion ly</i><br>
<i>&gt; scale correlations of magnetic fields.</i><br>
<p>
Several years ago I read (and reported here on) a book called "The Big<br>
Bang Never Happened".  The author challenged conventional theories about<br>
the formation and evolution of the universe.  He proposed that large<br>
scale dynamics were dominated by electromagnetic interactions rather<br>
than gravitational ones.  He had some pictures of plasmas which resembled<br>
the shapes of galaxies, with spirals, etc.<br>
<p>
Most theories that totally contradict the conventional wisdom turn out to<br>
be wrong, so this one probably is, too.  But Robin's comment about the<br>
possibility of very large scale, strong magnetic fields reminded me of<br>
this earlier theory.  There are a lot of things which cosmologistsy can't<br>
explain, so the door is not yet closed on alternatives.<br>
