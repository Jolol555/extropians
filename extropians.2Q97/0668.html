I will concur with Lee's first statement here.  I also had assumed that <br>
people would contact you via private mail if they had advice or <br>
insight into your condition.  I am sure that most who read your post <br>
would offer their sympathy, but sympathy would not necessarily be of <br>
the greatest use to you right now.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, we should feel free to ask life advice from each <br>
other, utilize each other as resources.  Persons who pioneer <br>
transhumanist thinking can at the least be misunderstood and <br>
at the worst become isolated.<br>
<p>
Because it is common knowledge to many on this list, I can tell you <br>
that I do relate to your condition in that I have also experienced <br>
recovery from near death.  While very difficult to endure at the <br>
time, it proved to be the most incredible learning experience of my <br>
little life and became a source of strength and perspective. When <br>
faced with the tremendous effort required to walk, talk and speak <br>
again, you have to know why you are undergoing that, what your goals are, <br>
what life is worth in the most basic of calculations.  And while <br>
others can help you with the physical and medical aspects of this <br>
process, the rest of it involves you facing yourself and that line <br>
that delineates our existence, without the comfort of the minor <br>
illusions humans conjur to ease their passages in life.  This <br>
exploration is every bit as dangerous and exciting as that taken by <br>
the astronauts who shoot off into space, and the knowledge gained is <br>
just as important to our advancement into whatever future forms.<br>
<p>
Take care,<br>
<p>
Kathryn Aegis<br>
