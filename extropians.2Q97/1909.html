<i>&gt; What is the extropian stance on capital punishment? Personally, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; against the death penalty because I don't believe that two wrongs make a</i><br>
<i>&gt; right. However, the issue takes on an added dimension when, in our</i><br>
<i>&gt; envisioned immortalist future, murder is equivalent to denying someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; eternity. What should be the punishment then?</i><br>
<p>
That's one of the few issues upon which libertarians, and even<br>
Objectivists, have no specific stance.  I've seen Friedman make<br>
economic arguments against it, but I think in general libertarians<br>
are split just as the public is.<br>
<p>
I personally don't think the US Government, or any government on<br>
Earth I've seen, has anywhere near sufficient moral integrity to<br>
issue such a judgment, so I oppose it.  Any government who would<br>
knowingly execute an innocent man after using him to testify<br>
against the real killer has no business being given that power.<br>
(Jesse Dewayne Jacobs, by Texas in 1995.  Governor George Bush Jr.<br>
signed the death warrant.)<br>
<p>
As far as punishing immortals, there's still isolation.  Removing<br>
one from public interaction and communication should be hardship<br>
at any level of technology.<br>
