I just read an article about creatine in Men's Health that seemed to<br>
cover most of my questions.<br>
<p>
	-.your muscles use oxygen to break down ATP into ADP-a slow proscess<br>
compared to some other methods. In explosive muscle use the cell finds<br>
other ways to make the converson.<br>
<p>
	-Creatine is made in the liver, stored in the muscle, and is used to<br>
make creatine phosphate which speeds up ATP regeneration.<br>
<p>
	-you get about 1 gram per lb. of meat- alot less than most studies use<br>
to gauge its effectiveness. <br>
<p>
	-most tests referred to in the article show improwed strength, power,<br>
and faster recovery.<br>
<p>
	-It's suggested that recreational athletes will not see it's full<br>
benifits. Distance athletes may see decreased performance and it may not<br>
affect some people at all.<br>
<p>
	-There are few long term use studies looking at long term effects.<br>
<p>
	-The article also talks about how and why you should load.<br>
<p>
   Check out the article if you use the stuff- hope this helps!<br>
