I actually spent a while thinking about how he was doing it all wrong.<br>
Juan Chanson's attempt was documented near the end of the book (pgs.<br>
534-536 of the Baen paperback).  He apparently:<br>
a) didn't control the breeding of the monkeys<br>
b) didn't even measure the monkeys' intelligence in any quantifiable way<br>
   (speed at solving problems, number of different attempts to solve a<br>
   particular problem, attention span, number of communication symbols<br>
   learned, etc.)<br>
c) taught the monkeys to do a particular task rather than how to solve<br>
   problems<br>
d) gave the monkeys no pro-cognition evolutionary pressures (I bet I could<br>
   think up some very useful predators, given time) (or, say, I could try to<br>
   get something as yummy to a monkey as a banana to grow inside something<br>
   as hard as a coconut shell)<br>
e) didn't even significantly control the environment of the monkeys<br>
f - z) (and more) a whole _bunch_ of stuff I'd have an awfully long time<br>
   to think of<br>
<p>
Basically I convinced myself in short order that, given his resources,<br>
there's no way I would have ended up in his sorry situation.  No surprise,<br>
since _he_ was well on the way to being nuts when his ordeal started, and<br>
had pretty much snapped before he even started his work on breeding an<br>
intelligent species.<br>
