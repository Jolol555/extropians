Last Thursday some of us in Washington, DC, attended a National<br>
Geographic lecture by astronaut Shannon Lucid about her 6-month stay<br>
aboard the Russian space station Mir.<br>
<p>
Some highlights of the lecture and discussion were (1) the biggest<br>
problem for space travel seems to be radiation exposure, (2) work on the<br>
new international space station is being hindered by economic<br>
transformations in Russia, (3) Mir is past its expected lifetime now and<br>
the cosmonauts spend almost 90% of their time on maintenance.<br>
<p>
Afterwards we met, appropriately, at the Luna Cafe.  Also appropriate,<br>
Kathryn shared some ideas about transhuman survival in alien<br>
environments from a story she is writing.<br>
<p>
Anyway, in light of the above, a few snippets from a story called "A<br>
Killer Commute, Nasty Gamma Rays, But What a View!" by Robert Steiner in<br>
today's Wall Street Journal might be entertaining:<br>
<p>
The subtitle is "Japanese Builders Plan Condos on the Moon; Is it Lunacy<br>
or Foresight".<br>
<p>
"Three of the biggest construction firms [in Japan] have spent an<br>
estimated $40 million on moon projects over the past decade. Shimizu<br>
alone will spend $3 million this year....<br>
<p>
Nishimatsu Construction Corp., which builds dams and tunnels on Earth,<br>
plans to build Escargot City on the moon. It's a high-rise resort<br>
development with three 10-story towers that each look like a cross<br>
between a snail and a beehive.<br>
<p>
Kazuo Kurihara, a senior Nishimatsu researcher, shows off a scale model.<br>
Each floor is an inflated ring, designed to repel pesky asteroids; the<br>
centerpiece is Hotel Nishimatsu with its conference halls and flashing<br>
neon sign.  Dr. Kurihara says his lab is working on a secret<br>
antiradiation wall material that will protect guests from the moon's<br>
killer gamma rays....<br>
<p>
Japanese companies have dozens of engineers working on lunar<br>
construction projects. By comparison, the U.S. National Aeronautics and<br>
Space Administration has 'somewhere between zero and two,' says Wendell<br>
Mendell, a planetary scientist at NASA's Johnson Space center in<br>
Houston, 'depending on the day you visit.'"<br>

P.S. I got tied up all weekend, how did the DC meeting on Sunday go?<br>
