Most of your points sound good here are a few more.<br>
<p>
As Robin pointed out maintaining fidelity in the germ line requires a <br>
lot of energy.  There is a very large burst of gene repair activity<br>
involved.  It would be to costly (for poor primitive genes) to maintain <br>
the whole body that well in the world we evolved in.  Also there is a <br>
balance between optimal mutation rates for adaptive change and the cost <br>
of those mutations in terms of survival.<br>
<p>
Genes are not the only thing competing for survival here.  Most of the<br>
things that are relatively poor at surviving are not very well<br>
represented in the world.  I don't think that bodies have ever passively<br>
accepted a role as mere carriers of the genes but they also compete<br>
with the genes they carry.  The process of life goes on at many<br>
different levels simultaneously.  I would like to get a better<br>
understanding of processes on a larger scale than me.<br>
