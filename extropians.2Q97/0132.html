<p>
I just ordered a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) meter from Tools For<br>
Exploration. By the way. There has been a recent thread on this listserv<br>
about Dianetics and Scientology. The main tool used by Scientologists is<br>
a GSR. It is what they use to measure their engrams. Jung and his<br>
colleagues were the first to use the GSR for this purpose, though<br>
Hubbard didn't give Jung (or anyone else for that matter) credit for the<br>
discovery. Many psychotherapists (non-scientologists and non-jungians)<br>
employ the GSR in their clinical practice today. It is effective in<br>
measuring stress levels via the amount of moisture present in the skin.<br>
The GSR is actually measuring your bodies electrical resistance. Its<br>
really pretty amazing if you ever get the opportunity to use one.<br>
<p>
Jung and Hubbard would run through a list of words with a patient and<br>
when the GSR meter reading increased they knew they were on to<br>
something. They would then use word associations and other technigues to<br>
further localize and reveal the source of a person's psychological<br>
problems. Once the source of the problem was fully remembered, the<br>
memory could be "discharged" so as not to have further neurotic<br>
effect/affect on the individual. A clear would be a person without any<br>
of these "negatively charged" repressed memories.<br>
 <br>

<p>
I used to own one, and found it somewhat helpful in attaining theta<br>
states. The discipline was in reaching and sustaining the state without<br>
losing consciousness. You have to keep your mind entertained while<br>
reducing the metabolism of your thoughts. The entrainment devices are<br>
definitely relaxing, but there's really not a lot to them yet. The thing<br>
about them is they do not require much from you. They entrain you.<br>
Personally, I'm more interested in bio-feedback. <br>

Explore and play!<br>
