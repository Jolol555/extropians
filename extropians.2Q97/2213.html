NIPS'97 Postconference Workshop<br>
                ===============================<br>
 <br>
        Can Artificial Cerebellar Models Compete to Control Robots?<br>

 <br>
Objective:<br>
----------<br>
Recent successes in robotics have broadened the field of application<br>
and acceptation of robots.  Nevertheless, industrial robotics still<br>
has to go a long way.  While the applicability of classical robots<br>
remains limited to factory floors, research lab robotics is moving<br>
towards novel actuators for constructing light-weight, compliant robot<br>
arms.  Hereto actuators are needed which consist of agonist-antagonist<br>
drive pairs for maintaining accurate positioning without recalibration,<br>
as well as for controlling the stiffness of a joint.  However, when<br>
these joints are combined to construct a robot arm, existing<br>
algorithms can only inaccurately control the arm at low velocities.<br>
 <br>
Starting from Albus' model from the 70's, neuro-computational models<br>
of the cerebellum have been advocated as possible candidates for the<br>
control of complex robot systems.  Unfortunately, there have been very<br>
few applications of cerebellar models to the control of real robot<br>
manipulators with at least 6 degrees of freedom.  Cerebellar models<br>
have become more refined through specialised investigations based on<br>
details of the biological cerebellar system, while insufficient<br>
attention has been given to applicability of these refinements in<br>
robotics. In the development of these methodologies, there are few<br>
examples of successful integration of neuro-computational models.<br>
 <br>
In this workshop we want to investigate how neuro-computational models<br>
might be incorporated as a standard part of robotics.  We want to<br>
address two questions: How reasonable is the desire for such an<br>
amalgamation?  What prerequisites are there for having cerebellar<br>
models successfully compete with alternative approaches to control of<br>
real robots?<br>
 <br>
These questions will be addressed through the presentation of papers<br>
which:<br>
  1. describe biologically plausible models of sensory-motor control;<br>
  2. apply cerebellar models to the control of robot manipulators;<br>
  3. describe robot control methodologies that can incorporate<br>
     cerebellar or other neuro-computational model (e.g., vision);<br>
  4. provide a case history illustrating barriers to successful<br>
     competition by cerebellar models for robot control.<br>
<p>
<p>
Call for Contributions<br>
======================<br>
For the workshop we will be looking for talks and papers which:<br>
<p>
* describe research applying cerebellar models to robot<br>
  applications implemented on real robots;<br>
<p>
* describe biologically plausible models of<br>
  sensory-motor control;<br>
<p>
* describe robot control methodologies that can incorporate<br>
  cerebellar or other neuro-computational model (e.g., vision);<br>
<p>
* provide a case history illustrating barriers to successful<br>
  competition by cerebellar models for robot control.<br>
