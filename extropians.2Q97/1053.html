Well, there you have it.  I think most Extropians would agree with the second<br>
statement, although many share mental similarities with their families (I<br>
do).  Naturally your family isn't going to approve of this attitude.<br>
<p>
I think it's valuable for happiness to have people you are very close to,<br>
have been close to for a long time, and will be close to for a long time.<br>
 Family is an easy and common way to get this, but it's not the only one.  <br>
