Funny, I just read these, but I had written the following for my diary<br>
today:<br>

<p>
your ego is your idea of yourself.<br>
and while you want to leave your idea of yourself<br>
subject to doubt and revision,<br>
you still need to be as true to yourself--your actual self--<br>
as you know how to be.<br>
and your ego is your own judgement--so far--about that.<br>
<p>
so the idea is not to fight or oppose or ignore or belittle the ego,<br>
but to realize that it is an idea, a judgement, and that it's necessary.<br>
<p>
you don't want to be ego-centric--enslaved to one of your own ideas,<br>
but you do want to be self-centered--speaking and acting from your<br>
own center as best you know how--and that know-how is your ego.<br>
<p>
it is possible to be more true to yourself than you *know* how to<br>
be, just because it's possible to have resources or luck that you<br>
didn't know you had.  in fact it's possible to know *that*, to count<br>
on it, make provision for it, choose it as a way of life--that is, to<br>
incorporate knowlege of your ego's incompleteness into your ego.<br>
<p>
but maybe what some people mean by ego is your self-image's tendency<br>
to distort to serve *itself*.<br>
<p>

I follow Fritz Perls' line in most things, and he noted that your "self" is<br>
just yourself.  You are your body, there is no "self" inside you.  But the<br>
ego, in Perls' terms, is the aspect of you that is trying to determine<br>
what's you and what's not-you.  Perls thought that most neuroses were<br>
problems of incorrect identification, treating self as nonself or vice-<br>
versa.  And he seemed both fascinated by "satori" (awakening) experiences,<br>
and scornful of the idea of "oneness with everything."  I still worship the<br>
guy but I think he was difficult sometimes.  I mean difficult to worship.<br>
Maybe he was saying what I was saying (or vice-versa): that are you and<br>
have to be you.<br>
<p>
I hope I made clear the three levels I was talking about above:<br>
actual self, idea/image of self, and the tendency of the idea to distort<br>
so as to become entrenched.  Only the last one of the three is something to<br>
work against.<br>
<p>
Goeff notes:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Some religions claim that this [letting go of ego] is letting in "god".</i><br>
<p>
Another way to look at it is to define "God" as all the stuff one's<br>
ideas and habits of perception don't account for.  So to let go [of<br>
preconceptions] is to "let [in] God."  I think a lot of what religions say<br>
is useful--even vital--when you interpret it in that way.  Ideas and<br>
habits have a tendency to close in on themselves tighter and tighter, and<br>
it's important to have a compass that keeps pointing you in the opposite<br>
direction.<br>
