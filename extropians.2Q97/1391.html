It's so funny: while most humans are against cloning their physical bodies,<br>
they find nothing wrong - and even encourage - cloning of their ideas,<br>
value system, mindsets, etc., such as religious teachings, standardized<br>
textbooks and languages, political consensus-building, or computers.<br>
Even the arguments against biological cloning are not aimed against<br>
repetition, they are trying to preserve the status quo.  I am sure<br>
the protesters against cloning would equally oppose artificial genetic<br>
variations of any kind, even though their effect would be opposite to<br>
cloning.<br>
  It is exactly these people who make me feel that I live in a land<br>
of cloned mundanes; they have reasonably varied body shapes, but<br>
frightingly similar collections of off-the-shelf motivations and<br>
interests.<br>
  If I ever decide to raise one more child, I think I'd rather raise<br>
a clone of myself.  I would know him in advance much better than any<br>
other child, and would be able to provide him with support, environment,<br>
education and personal opportunities that I dreamed about so much when I<br>
was young but never received - thus assuring, by the way, that he would<br>
grow up much more different from me than the conservative people's<br>
children are [intended to be] from their parents.   Maybe, that's why<br>
they wouldn't let me do it?<br>
 <br>
  There are, of course, "natural clones" - the twins.  I do not know<br>
what part of the population have genetically identical twins, and I bet<br>
neither do most of the people who don't want to see the same situations<br>
created intentionally.  "Whatever that number is, it is the ideal number,<br>
don't increase it, don't change anything, my cloned mind can't handle<br>
change, just leave things the way they are!"<br>
