Real estate is categorized under my blunder list.  I was co-owner of two<br>
homes in Colorado, one in a exclusive ski resort, the other in Boulder near<br>
the University.  The houses were purchased at a low price.  I did a lot of<br>
renovation on both homes, and enjoyed it immensely.  <br>
<p>
The blunder was on the house in the ski resort.  We sold too soon -- just<br>
before prices ski-rocketed.  It was commercially zoned, (my first business<br>
was in this house).  Patience is a virtue in real estate.  My partners had<br>
other priorities, although I wanted to hang on to the property.  Last time I<br>
walked by the house, it was for sale for 16 2/3rd times price we sold it.<br>
Big blunder.<br>
