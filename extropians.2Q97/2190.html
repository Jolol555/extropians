Now that the CDA has been defeated in the Supreme Court, pundits are <br>
focusing on user-education and self-filtering programs.  PICS has been <br>
mentioned as an up and coming standard for user-filtration.  However, <br>
WIRED has mentioned that PICS could be used by anybody to censor others <br>
without their knowledge or consent.<br>
<p>
Is this going to be a problem?  And can anybody explain to me how this <br>
could be done?  And most importantly since this a technical form of <br>
censorship, is there a technical way around it?<br>
