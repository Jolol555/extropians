<i>&gt; Subject: Your registered page  has changed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This message is never sent unsolicited.</i><br>
<i>&gt; NetMind's "URL-minder" has detected new changes in:</i><br>
<i>&gt;   <a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/</a></i><br>
<p>
This URL-minder service I mentioned a few weeks ago provides a form of<br>
"push" technology which notifies you of changes in web pages you have<br>
selected.  I see on looking at Robin's page that he is going to be at<br>
Berkeley starting this summer as a "Scholar in Health Policy".  (Apologies<br>
if this is old news, or if I am announcing it prematurely.)<br>
<p>
This program is a multi-disciplinary effort to analyze health policy<br>
using economics, political science, and sociology.  From their web page:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Economists may help by examining the merits of market-based competition</i><br>
<i>&gt; versus regulatory approaches, by analyzing the effects of organizational</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes on the cost of care and on the willingness of competing</i><br>
<i>&gt; organizations to serve diverse population groups, and by assessing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; effects of continued growth in health spending on federal and state</i><br>
<i>&gt; budgets as well as on other sectors of the nation's economy.</i><br>
<p>
This sounds like exactly the kind of study which can benefit from the<br>
kind of hard-nosed, critical analysis that Robin is known for, as well<br>
as his creative, decentralized solutions to difficult problems.  I hope<br>
they know what they are getting into bringing him on board...<br>
<p>
Only 12 people are selected each year for this program, and although I<br>
am not familiar with the post-doc job market, the stipend looks generous,<br>
and the freedom from teaching and administrative responsibilities sounds<br>
like an ideal research environment.<br>
<p>
Clearly health care policy is going to be of increasing importance in<br>
the next few years, with the ongoing advances in research results that<br>
we all expect.  Congratulations to Robin on being selected for this<br>
position!<br>
<p>
