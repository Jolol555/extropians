Yes, there is a distinction between sex and nudity.  And Americans can<br>
recognize that distinction.<br>
Though cognizant of the distinction, I too become embarrassed when nude<br>
before the masses.  You see, although sex and nudity are not the same, there<br>
is a bridge between them.  <br>
And I get embarrassed when I "erect" that bridge in public.<br>
