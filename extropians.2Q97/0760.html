There are lots of urban legends out there about great inventions that have<br>
been suppressed by The Powers That Be.  In these stories, They seem to use<br>
threats, media blackouts, and murders that look like accidents.  I am<br>
willing to believe that all such stories are bunk.  However, there is<br>
another way to suppress an invention: licence the patent, and then don't<br>
manufacture it.  This is entirely legal, though people don't tend to talk<br>
about it, as it is anti-social. Does anyone know of a time when this has<br>
definitely happened?<br>
<p>
Let me tell a story of a time when this *might* have happened.  A friend of<br>
mine came up with an idea for an easily manufactured consumer gizmo that<br>
would distribute many millions of dollars a year in revenue away from the<br>
big long distance companies, particularly AT&amp;T.  My wife and I hoped to<br>
capture some of these millions, so we looked into patenting it.  Alas, a<br>
patent search revealed that exactly the device in question had been patented<br>
in 1993:  <br>
<p>
<a href="http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5425085">http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5425085</a><br>
<p>
The company that got the patent is a small phone-equipment manufacturing<br>
firm that would be perfectly placed to build the device and make a ton of<br>
money.  But it's four years later and they haven't.  Why not? <br>
<p>
I will now speculate recklessly.  <br>
<p>
I estimate the device could be sold for $80 with a manufacturer's profit of<br>
$10. The average customer that buys this gizmo will save $300 per year on<br>
phone bills, which will cost AT&amp;T about $70 per year.  It is worth it for<br>
AT&amp;T to pay the inventor any amount between $10 and $70 per unit to make<br>
this gizmo not be sold.  If I had the patent, I'd probably take them up on<br>
it.  Millions of dollars, for not working.<br>
<p>
Has this actually happened?  I don't know.  But it could.<br>
