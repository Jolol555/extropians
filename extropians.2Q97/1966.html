Hardly; in an anarcho-capitalist society you have a choice as to whether<br>
you subscribe to a legal system which allows capital punishment. Since<br>
this may reduce the associated costs of the system many people probably<br>
would. I probably wouldn't, but my decision would depend on the <br>
difference in price.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; CIA prohibited assassinations for moral and prudential reasons which </i><br>
<i>&gt; Richard Bissell gives in his autobiography, "Reflections of a Cold </i><br>
<i>&gt; Warrior"  [Yasle, 1996]. Not least, because it degrades policymaking with </i><br>
<i>&gt; an 'Off with their head' modality of thought.</i><br>
<p>
And because foreign leaders might then 'bring the war back home' by<br>
killing US politicians rather than US conscripts. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; [2] It's _unnecessary_: check the murder rates country by country and </i><br>
<i>&gt; compare them with the execution rates.  Supporters would predict an iverse </i><br>
<i>&gt; correlation:  but there is none.  In fact, countries with execution are </i><br>
<i>&gt; frequently _more_ murder-prone. </i><br>
<p>
Or, perhaps, more murder-prone countries are more likely to execute<br>
criminals in an attempt to reduce the murder rate. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Every country in Europe is safer than any </i><br>
<i>&gt; state in the US, AFAIK.</i><br>
<p>
Not true; several US states are 'safer' (in terms of lower murder rates)<br>
than some European countries. If you're not an inner-city drug dealer then<br>
most US states are comparable to most European countries. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At the completion of the month, you _have_ to execute the accused _even if </i><br>
<i>&gt; you believe they're innocent, and you'll destroy the hasppiness of others, </i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps deprive the world of irreplaceable talents, and be executed </i><br>
<i>&gt; yourself into the bargain.</i><br>
<p>
I suspect the Extropian approach would be to back them up prior to<br>
execution so that you could reinstate them if you were wrong. Of course<br>
it's far from ideal, but it's better than killing them permanently; though<br>
a smart criminal would back themselves up before undertaking a crime just<br>
in case they're caught.<br>
