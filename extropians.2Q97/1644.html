	The "advanced" being may think it is more advanced.  Human beings have<br>
also thought they were more advanced than others (and in some cases they<br>
were, technologically).  African (or South American? both? I forget.<br>
source, recent Discover magazine) tribes often give themselves names that<br>
can be translated roughly to "the most human."  The tribes do not<br>
systematically enslave each other because they cannot.  They may define<br>
themselves as better but they are not more powerful, and that is what it<br>
comes down to.  Europeans saw themselves as better than others and they had<br>
the technology to enforce this view, although often not without a fight.  I<br>
doubt any advanced intelligence would have any use for us, as they would<br>
probably have developed nanotech in which case the most use they would find<br>
for us is the matter in our bodies.  If they somehow managed to take to the<br>
stars without nanotech and wanted to enslave us you can be sure that it<br>
would be costly (and if it wasn't they would not have to take slaves).<br>
