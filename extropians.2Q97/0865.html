Making a Gamma ray burster in your back yard would not be a good idea, but  <br>
what would be a reasonable energy source for an super advanced civilization? <br>
Solar power may be old fashioned but I still like it. I certainly would not <br>
recommend building breeder reactors, there is already a glut of plutonium in<br>
the world. All reactors produce plutonium, a big power plant reactor will <br>
invariable produce many tons of it in its lifetime. A breeder reactor is <br>
designed to maximize the production of plutonium. I'm not even a great fan of <br>
conventional reactors, and call me a wimp if you want to, but breeders really  <br>
give me the creeps.<br>
<p>
1) A breeder is at a much higher energy density than a regular reactor and      <br>
   that means it's inherently more dangerous.<br>
<p>
2) A conventional reactor uses Uranium as fuel in which the U235 has been    <br>
   enriched from the naturally occurring .7% concentration to about 4%,    <br>
   you need about 85% to make a bomb.  A breeder uses weapons grade plutonium    <br>
   as a fuel, and lots of it.<br>
<p>
3) A conventional reactor uses water as a coolant and to slow down the  <br>
   neutrons, a breeder uses molten sodium that burns in the air and explodes    <br>
   in the presents of water. After a short time in operation this hot liquid    <br>
   sodium becomes intensely radioactive. Just last year a leak in a sodium <br>
   pump destroyed the newest and largest breeder reactor in Japan,  if it<br>
   wasn't in a containment building it could have been a human disaster.    <br>
   It's already an economic disaster of several hundred million dollars.<br>
<p>
The thing I really don't like about fission reactors is that they produce all  <br>
that damn plutonium. There is so much of it in existence, thousands of tons,  <br>
that it's very hard to keep track of it all. You only need slightly over  <br>
9 pounds to make a crude nuclear bomb, less if you're clever.<br>
<p>
There is another type of Nuclear power, but there are 2 things I don't like   <br>
about fusion reactors. <br>
<p>
1) They don't exist, yet. <br>
<p>
2) Most reactions would make things near the reactor radioactive because they    <br>
   produce high speed neutrons.  <br>
         <br>
The fusion reaction I like best is between non radioactive deuterium <br>
(Hydrogen 2) and non radioactive Helium 3, this produces non radioactive   <br>
Helium 4, an easily controlled proton, 18.3 mev of energy, and most important <br>
of all, no neutron. Unfortunately you need a higher temperature to achieve it  <br>
than the deuterium tritium reaction most are talking about.<br>
<p>
There is a type of cold fusion that definitely works, even as cold as 13 <br>
degrees Kelvin but, as Eugene mentioned recently, there hasn't been much <br>
happening in muon-catalyzed cold fusion lately, and it's a shame because the <br>
idea seems so elegant. A negative muon is almost identical to an electron<br>
except it's 207 times as massive, you can even substitute them for electrons <br>
in Hydrogen and the result is atoms and molecules 207 times smaller than <br>
normal. In all fusion reactions you need to get the nucleus of 2 atoms so <br>
close that the short range nuclear forces can take over, this is not easy to <br>
do because the nucleus of both atoms have a positive charge and so repel each<br>
other. In normal fusion you use brute force to do this, things get very hot <br>
and so the two slam together, if you use muons instead of electrons in a <br>
hydrogen molecule the two nuclei are already 207 times closer together even <br>
when ice cold.<br>
<p>
There are problems of course, it takes energy to make a muon, to break even <br>
each muon would have to catalyze between 100 and 500 fusion reactions, and <br>
muons are not stable, their half life is 2*10^-6 seconds, but a lot can happen<br>
in two microseconds, that's a very long time by particle physics standards. <br>
I know of no fundamental reason it couldn't be made to work.<br>
