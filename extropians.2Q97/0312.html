<i>&gt; While I agree with Robin on the base point that time has an economic </i><br>
<i>&gt; value and that it represents a resource that must be carefully managed </i><br>
<i>&gt; within a group, I fail to understand how rendering that into coinage of </i><br>
<i>&gt; any sort will solve the problems that plague group discussions, </i><br>
<i>&gt; because those problems usually stem from factors other than the amount </i><br>
<i>&gt; of time someone speaks.  </i><br>
<p>
If there's a specific claim in there, please name it.  I don't know<br>
what problems you have in mind, so I can't solve them.  The fact<br>
that reader attention is valuable and posting is free leads to an<br>
obovious tragedy of the commons that the proposal helps solve.  If<br>
you have other problems, be specific.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From a design standpoint, for any facilitation process to be fully </i><br>
<i>&gt; effective, it must make accomodations for what is known as 'minority' </i><br>
<i>&gt; viewpoints, the word 'minority' referring both to the social standing </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the speaker and the popularity of a viewpoint.  I could predict </i><br>
<i>&gt; a situation in which a few people are highly 'paid' to silence someone </i><br>
<i>&gt; else, akin to holding a filibuster.  Or a situation in which the </i><br>
<i>&gt; economic incentive to garner more 'coins' leads to the development of </i><br>
<i>&gt; opposing factions that stall collaborative discussion.  </i><br>
<p>
Read the specific proposal again: coins are issued to /all/ participants<br>
regularly, and once spent, coins get reissued randomly.  The only way<br>
someone can be "silenced" is by his own choice, and even then, his<br>
comments appear on the unpaid list.  In fact, it is likely that some<br>
people will refrain from making minor comments on the paid list so that<br>
they can save up for those times when they really want to let fly.  But<br>
that's exactly what we want--the paid list having the discussions the<br>
authors found most important, and the unpaid list having everything else.<br>
