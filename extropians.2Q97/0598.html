Well, I took a look at the websites you mentioned. While they both <br>
contained introductory materials, they did not explain it as simply as I <br>
would like it. What I would like is a website showing the bare-bones view <br>
of various basics, so that one could argue rationally about them ("I see <br>
here that you attribute X to Y, which makes it rational to do Z...").<br>
<p>
This would go for a lot of other theories and models, like <br>
nanotechnology. Ideally one would have "support and consequence trees": <br>
the facts and ideas which support and lead to the basic idea, and the <br>
logical consequences of it. I think it would look good in a graphical <br>
form, and make discussing them easier. <br>
