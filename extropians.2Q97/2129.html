     William Wiser queried:<br>
     <br>
     What sort of tradeoffs do you see between time spent making money<br>
     and time spent doing other things?  How much money is plenty?<br>
     <br>
     which has been an issue that has been festering for me since I signed <br>
     on with this discussion.<br>
     <br>
     Lee Daniel Crocker replied:<br>
     <br>
     There is no such thing as "enough" or "plenty"; they are menaingless <br>
     abstractions.<br>
     <br>
     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     As if that assertion isn't potent with its own meaning!  Do you really <br>
     think something that circular and benign has genuine significance?  I <br>
     sympathize with Mr. Wiser's query and am concerned about the <br>
     self-absorbed tendancies of a full-blown libertarian perspective which <br>
     rear their unattractive heads in this digest from time to time.  It <br>
     seems imbalanced and lacking sensitivity.  Forgive my frankness but <br>
     your assertions occur in contrast to Mr. Wiser's questions as haughty <br>
     and dismissive.<br>
     <br>
     *Enough* is when you aren't devoting energy to a particular goal or <br>
     desire.  As in full or satiated.<br>
     <br>
     *Plenty* is when you can comfortably/benevolently redirect your focus <br>
     and consider the needs/desires of others or embellish/expand your own. <br>
      As in comfort or even abundance.<br>
     <br>
     I have applied meaning to your absolutist assertion of no meaning and <br>
     request that you devote a modicum of time/energy to address Mr. <br>
     Wiser's question with some respect and consideration.  Otherwise, it <br>
     would be more beneficial to simply refrain because credibility <br>
     expressed in the motif you've chosen is seriously lacking.<br>
     <br>
     It appears you moderate this digest or at least decide what types of <br>
     submissions are included (I attempted to submit an attachment because <br>
     =20 marks were peppering my submissions, thus making them <br>
     unpleasant/undesirable to read).  Please, use your sharpened intellect <br>
     with some discretion and graciousness!<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
