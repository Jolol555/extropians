My response:<br>
<p>
This is a potentially loaded statement and I'd like some clarification on <br>
it as well as pose a question.<br>
<p>
Are human rights exclusive to humans because we have the power to invent <br>
and enforce them (as opposed to apes/gorillas and other creatures which we <br>
have established do not)?  <br>
<p>
I continue to marvel at the mileage this "Planet of the Apes" thread seems <br>
to have.  Perhaps it touches down in a territory of undecided or <br>
questionable ethics that make the more-evolved mind uncomfortable because <br>
of the potential conflict of interests or duality represented by the notion <br>
of enslaving creatures (we enslave the smart ones, we eat the dumb ones).<br>
