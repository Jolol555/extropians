Kennita Watson &lt;kwatson1@home.com&gt;:<br>
<i>&gt; The point is that saying that something "violates the laws of physics"</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't convince people -- being open to input that seems to violate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; known laws is what allows people to discover new ones.  And calling the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people names *certainly* doesn't convince them...</i><br>
<p>
Having just checked many of the usual sites I use for good debunking<br>
info, I must admit that there is very little on the old water-power<br>
scam.  I had assumed that such info would be plentiful; such good<br>
resources like the Skeptic's Dictionary, urbanlegends.com, and others<br>
have lots of good rational analyses of such claims, but this specific<br>
one is under-documented, so I suppose I do bear some culpability for<br>
assuming that our proponent had more resources than he actually did.<br>
I'm sure a more thorough search might turn up something better, but<br>
I doubt our particular reporter would have been swayed by calmer heads<br>
anyway, as his credulity seemed unswayed by any of the replies, and I<br>
didn't think a suggestion to read the whole set of Feynmann Lectures<br>
on Physics would be very welcome, although that's really all there is<br>
to say.<br>
<p>
Guru George:<br>
<i>&gt; Well put, Kennita.  I would just say, to balance it back the other way</i><br>
<i>&gt; just slightly from where you leave it, that this is a list in which</i><br>
<i>&gt; *critical thinking* is important.  I think Mike offered the car thing in</i><br>
<i>&gt; a spirit of critical (political) thinking, and while that's great, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; while I think his critics were a bit rude in a human sort of way, still,</i><br>
<i>&gt; he's got to take the criticism seriously if he wants to participate in</i><br>
<i>&gt; that critical spirit.  (The thing is, I'm sure his critics would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; some sympathy with his political point in itself, to some extent -</i><br>
<i>&gt; perhaps that might be a more interesting topic?)</i><br>
<p>
Actually I find the political claim--the idea that some unnamed agency<br>
of government might be capable of supressing a spectacularly valuable<br>
invention, that it would be in their interest to do so, and that the<br>
effect on the economy would be anything but positive--even more ludicrous<br>
that the pseudo-scientific claims, and strong evidence that the author<br>
is not merely a harmless crackpot but trying to perpetrate a deliberate<br>
fraud upon his readers for some purpose I can only speculate.  And while<br>
I might have some sympathy for innocent dupes, I have none for criminals.<br>
