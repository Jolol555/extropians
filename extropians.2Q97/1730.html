If Green is 'real', then could you perhaps point it out to me? I find<br>
Dennett's theory (that colors are simply tags we attach to certain kinds<br>
of incoming data) far more convincing than yours. <br>
<p>

<p>
But you just said that Green is something real, now you seem to be<br>
reversing that claim to say that Green is indeed merely a tag inside our<br>
heads. <br>
<p>

<p>
No, they reject it because they believe that there's something 'spiritual'<br>
inside themselves because that's what everyone's told them. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Blue is not some</i><br>
<i>&gt; abstract representation of a particular wavelength of light. </i><br>
<p>
Then what is it? You seem to be reversing your opinion again.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	These are my thoughs on this subject, what do you think?  Do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you fear or wince at the idea of calling it "spiritual" stuff?  If so</i><br>
<i>&gt; then why?</i><br>
<p>
I for one don't fear it, I just find it pointless because it tells us<br>
absolutely nothing new. Treating the brain as a computer explains the vast<br>
majority of our observations about human behaviour. We don't need to <br>
bring 'spirits' into this.<br>
