<i>        &gt;Are there any good books that cover current work in genetics? </i><br>

<p>
Try "The Human Blueprint" by Robert Shapiro, the book is ancient, almost <br>
5 years old, but very good. I presume you've already read "The Selfish Gene" <br>
by Richard Dawkins, if not, shame on you. I just bought Dawkins new book <br>
"Climbing Mount Improbable" today, if it's no good it will be the first bad <br>
book he ever wrote.      <br>
<p>

<i>        &gt;I saw Ed Regis's book Nanotechnology in the window the other day.         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Any opinions on that? </i><br>
                            <br>
<p>
Yes, I thought it was excellent. If you know nothing about Nanotechnology <br>
this is the place to start, by the way it's called "Nano".<br>
<p>
"Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman" by Richard Feynman is the perfect book to <br>
read on an airplane, it's both funny and profound and about one of the most <br>
brilliant men of the century.<br>
<p>
A lot of people hate "The Physics of Immortality" by Frank Tipler, but not me, <br>
I thought it well worth reading.<br>
<p>
The best science fiction novel I've read in years is "The Silicon Man" by <br>
Charles Platt.<br>
<p>
If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have 10 books <br>
"Godel Escher Bach" by Douglas Hofstadter would certainly be one of them, <br>
as would "The Tao Is Silent" by Raymond Smullyan.  Smullyan is a mystic and <br>
I don't agree with everything he says, but it's an absolutely wonderful and <br>
brilliant book. Before I read Smullyan I thought that all mystics were fools,<br>
now I know that is not true, only most of them. <br>
                                      <br>
