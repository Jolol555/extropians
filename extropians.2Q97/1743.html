(For some of you this is a second announcement - <br>
because it was not quite so definite before.)<br>
<p>
I'm losing two rentmates at end of June.  If you've been to a <br>
"Free Exchange" you know the place.  (Now picture it without chairs.)<br>
<p>
It's a comfortable flat in northwest San Francisco, <br>
well lit, airy, cool, near Golden Gate Park and the ocean.  <br>
Garage (one space), laundry.<br>
One of the nearly-departed used the dining-ell for an office.<br>
<p>
Present occupant (me) has varied interests, mild (but not monotonous) <br>
taste in music, and a sense of humor which some find cryptic.<br>
<p>
$450, plus $50 for whoever uses the garage.  <br>
Nonsmokers required (by landlord as well as me), book-lovers preferred.<br>
<p>
Please pass the word.<br>
