I'd kill to see an audience of hard-headed, purple-faced silk-tied<br>

their teeth when exposed to this kind of memoids. Hee-heeh. <br>

I think this has a darker undertone: an ALife golem population, sent out<br>
to trade on the web, to mine cash for a bright programmer, could very soon<br>
develop a kind of private interest in the harsh darwinian web theatre soon<br>
to dominate out there. Current protection system brittleness assuming<br>
(ice=firewalls, authentication and crypted links), matrix subversion<br>
through evolved agents is a very real possibility. Consider AFUTD:<br>
man-made Blight reaching out to claim Earth seems a very real possibility. <br>
The digicash demise. Flight of fancy? I think not entirely. <br>
