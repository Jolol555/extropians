Chris Thompson,<br>
	I really liked your post on "PTs".  I identified with one part very much.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I've been pondering this very subject VERY hard for the past several</i><br>
<i>&gt; weeks. At the risk of using a cliche, I've come to realize that Wealth</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesnt equal money. You only need enough to support the lifestyle you</i><br>
<i>&gt; want. If you do what you want, live where you want, and feel 'Free',</i><br>
<i>&gt; then you are wealthy. Dont get me wrong, I'd love to be obscenely</i><br>
<i>&gt; rich. But I think I could live as a PT for actually alot less than I</i><br>
<i>&gt; make now. </i><br>
<p>
	When we first recognized our sovereignty we were bringing in a net of $8K<br>
per month and living on $100 per month.  We lived in a 2m x 3m travel<br>
trailer which we parked on the street, moving it every two or three days. <br>
We were a member of the YMCA for $100 per year, so we had full use of all<br>
their facilities, including toilets, showers, pools, weight rooms, etc.  We<br>
had food, clothes and shelter and we were free!  What more does one want? <br>
Well, a computer for one thing. :-)  After about four years of that we<br>
created a small, private park where visitors could also feel free.  But we<br>
really had a chance to see how little one needs of "things", and once one<br>
is free from the urge to fill their lives with "things" they are really<br>
free, free to make their own choices without all the shadow voices in the<br>
head giving their opinion to sway their decision.  And you don't have to<br>
worry about someone ripping-off your "things". :-)  Never locked doors,<br>
never suffered a theft.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; The family still is and will continue to be important. But still,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; its not an obstacle for the PT. Event if you travel a lot, you'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; probably want to return "home" once in a while.</i><br>
<p>
	And there there are many ways to accomplish that.  The main thing is, what<br>
is it that holds one back?             <br>
	What is of greater value than recognizing one's sovereignty?<br>
	What's got a hold on you, Baby? :-)<br>
