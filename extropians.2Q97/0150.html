<i>&gt;Of course you have no proof that humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; are any different; most people I know have 'buttons' you can press (by</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing or saying something) which will make them react in a predictable</i><br>
and<br>
<i>&gt; seemingly deterministic fashion. </i><br>
<p>
	"Most" ?  Is this somewhere between 51 % and 99 %?<br>
	Can you be more exact?<br>
	What are those people who do not have "buttons" like?<br>
	Are they emotionless, comatose, non-productive entities?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	When you boil all the bullshit out of it, is not ego simply the notion</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; being an individual?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure of the 'official' definition of the word, and few of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; people I've asked seem to have any idea either. </i><br>
<p>
ego: 		1. the "I" or self of any person; a person as thinking, feeling, and<br>
willing, and distinguishing itself from the selves of others and from<br>
objects of its thought.<br>
		2. (often cap.) Philos. a. the enduring and conscious element that knows<br>
experience.  b. Scholasticism...the  complete man comprising both body and<br>
soul.<br>
		3. Psychoanal.  the part of the psychic apparatus that experiences and<br>
reacts to the outside world and thus mediates between the primitive drives<br>
of the id and the demands of the social and physical environment.<br>
		4. egoitsm, or self-importance.<br>
		5. self-esteem or self-image; feelings.<br>
This was taken out of a direction-ary....you know, the book which gives<br>
directions on the use of words?<br>
<p>
To me ego is the<br>
<i>&gt; difference between a person's perception of themselves and their real</i><br>
<i>&gt; state. This is why it holds people back; you can't act sensibly if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know who you are. </i><br>
<p>
	Would you suggest that Socrates' admonition to "Know thyself." applies in <br>
this 	modern age?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Is it possible for an individual to see their life the same way any </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other individual sees their own life?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes. It just takes effort to eliminate the ego nonsense and see yourself </i><br>
<i>&gt; as you truly are.</i><br>
<p>
	What do you consider "ego nonsense"?<br>
	How would someone "know" they were seeing themselves as they "truly are?<br>
	How does seeing oneself as one truly is, help to see your life the same<br>
way 	any other individual sees their own life?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I think the biggest problem with reprogramming is that people first have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to accept that they are programmed entities. </i><br>
<p>
	How were they programmed?<br>
	Were other entities involved?<br>
<p>
They usually try to change the subject to avoid having to even consider<br>
that<br>
<i>&gt; they might be 'just' computers. </i><br>
<p>
	Do you think you are 'just' a computer?<br>
	Is this just another way of simplifying humans?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Everyone has a self-activated joy-button connected to the "feels good" </i><br>
<i>&gt; section of the brain. Most people just haven't worked out how to activate</i><br>
<i>&gt; it yet except through interactions with other people ('love', etc). Again</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's just a matter of programming.</i><br>
<p>
	Have you worked out how to activate it yet?<br>
	If you have, could you share the programming, or do you sell it?<br>
	Also, if you have, do you prefer to turn your own "joy button" on or do<br>
you 	prefer having interactions with other people ('love', etc.) ?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Have you ever experienced 100% Bliss?  Can people experience this </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; state at will?  Can they go from Bliss to rationality at will?</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Close to 100%, maybe and yes. Utter bliss is fun, but it gets dull after</i><br>
a <br>
<i>&gt; while, at least for me. </i><br>
<p>
	Does not "utter" mean complete, total, absolute?<br>
	Do you know what 69% bliss is like?<br>
	Would 23% bliss be less boring for you?<br>
	How do you arrive at the percentage of bliss less than 100%?<br>
	Can you have a 46% orgasm?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Regarding ego ( Ego) and bliss... the so called 'spiritual ( which I</i><br>
beleive<br>
<i>&gt; is just another part of our brain's inner working) bliss'  of letting go</i><br>
of<br>
<i>&gt; the ego ( awareness of the separation between self and reality) is well</i><br>
<i>&gt; known. An interesting topic. It seems to be hardwired into many humans.</i><br>
Some<br>
<i>&gt; religions claim that this is letting in "god".</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think it is important in an evolutionary sense, regarding</i><br>
consciousness. <br>
<p>
	"hardwired into many"....what studes have indicated this?<br>
	Why would some humans have this "hardwiring" and others not?<br>
	"claim that this is letting in "god".....What do the people who have these<br>
	experiences claim it is?<br>
	Are there any common themes reported by these people?<br>
	How is it important in an evolutionary sense, regarding consciousness?<br>
