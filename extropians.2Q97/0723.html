<i>&gt;  WHere is he getting the power to electrolyse the water? From power</i><br>
<i>&gt;  plants of course. I highly suggest that you get some hard facts on how</i><br>
<i>&gt;  much power his system demands from the grid. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, I believe the power comes from the alternator.</i><br>

I see that you are one of the members of the population Piaget found<br>
were simply incapable of abstract reasoning. I suppose it isn't your<br>
fault.<br>

<i>&gt; The whole deal on this water car and why the government doesnt like it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that ANYBODY can convert their car to run on water through a simple process</i><br>
<i>&gt; of building a hydrogen converter and changing some things in the engine,</i><br>
<i>&gt; putting the oil companies out of business, and ruining the pacts they have</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the government and the economy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; - -danny</i><br>
<p>
Tell you what. Convert your car. Show those evil government types a<br>
thing or two, eh? Its not like they can't keep you away from all the<br>
water you'd like to run your car.<br>
<p>
Now go away and call back when you've done it.<br>

Really! PLEASE!<br>

<i>&gt; I am sure Da Vinci or Picasso would have both failed your little test.</i><br>
<p>
Da Vinci was considered a scientific genius in his own day, and<br>
probably would have passed any test given by his contemporaries.<br>
<p>
Picasso was an artist, and I am not sure I would have cared to hear<br>
his opinions on subjects like medicine or how to propel cars.<br>

<i>&gt; I actually got a double A in science. This was in a country in which</i><br>

<p>
I suppose that tells you how low the standards have gotten in the<br>
U.S., eh?<br>
<p>
Look, go off, convert your car to run on nothing but water<br>
(electrolysed by the current you get from the alternator), and hail a<br>
passing UFO.<br>
<p>
When I started this mailing list (a long, long time ago in a galaxy<br>
far, far away) it was not supposed to be for a bunch of fuzzy-headed<br>
UFOlogists debating whether the government was trying to keep cars<br>
running on water away from the public. It was supposed to be an oasis<br>
for our little clique -- unashamedly so.<br>
<p>
I'm not embarassed by the idea of a private space for friends to<br>
unwind, let their hair down, and happily chat away about whether it<br>
was more likely that people would go back to the gold standard under a<br>
free banking regime or use some other sort of backing, or to discuss<br>
whether beta carotine is or isn't something you should be taking to<br>
extend your life, or to exchange information on whether the state of<br>
the art in space launch vehicles is actually progressing.<br>
<p>
I have nothing against the existance of other sorts of people, but in<br>
a world hostile to pleasant conversation among people with whom you<br>
share a rationalist anarcho-cryonicist world view, it seemed nice to<br>
have an online space of our own.<br>

<i>&gt; 						- 'Book of Joy', M.El.Mir</i><br>
<p>
Look, FEEL SUPERIOR if you want to. I don't care how you feel. I just<br>
don't want to have to waste my time reading about crap. Maybe you are<br>
right -- maybe we're all idiots for not believing in the water powered<br>
car running off of hydrogen electrolysed with the alternator -- but<br>
frankly I'd be happier if you left us to our fate while you prayed for<br>
the return of the aliens who will come bearing the magic water power<br>
machines.<br>
