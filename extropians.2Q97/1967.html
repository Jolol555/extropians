<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;..... it seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; obvious that the concept will be very successful in the long run. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Well, it depends. I agree that the basic idea is quite neat, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;there is an appalling lack of technical information and calculation</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;on the pages (including the "academic" section - what?! no literature</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;references?). Of course, this could be because Robodyne wants to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;patent it etc., but there are enough grandiose claims about</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;terraforming, uploading, nanotechnology and self-repair to make my</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;bogosity detectors chime.</i><br>
<p>
Um yeah. This has been detrimental to my own work, as comparisons have <br>
been drawn.<br>
<p>
 I have asked Joe Michael about these things<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;but have not yet got an answer.</i><br>
<p>
I wouldn't hold my breath. There is also a 'Stellar Drive" at the site that purports to <br>
exploit a "little known flaw" in Maxwell's Equations...<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Anders Sandberg                                      Towards Ascension!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I agree that there are a huge number of details to be worked out- a lot</i><br>
<i>&gt;would depnd on how self contained you coudl make these things, as well as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the scale you could make them at..  And the site certainly does send the</i><br>
<i>&gt;hype-meter way over into the red.  I'm not about to send this guy any money</i><br>
<i>&gt;(even if I had it..heh), but I think the basic idea of these cubes which can</i><br>
<i>&gt;organize themselves is a very poweful one.  In fact I've started working</i><br>
<i>&gt;this morning on a program to simulate the idea and see what I can get them</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do with a few basic rules. </i><br>
<p>
I published a paper in an IEEE Proceedings on CA modeling of these structures.<br>
I'll put it on my website pretty soon.<br>
<p>
 As I've said, I have no idea how original<br>
<i>&gt;this all is- in fact it seems almost impossible that Robodyne is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;originator of the concept....</i><br>
<p>
I am not sure if Joe Michael (he is essentially Robodyne) thought it up<br>
independently or not (nor do I care). See the "Me n Joe" post.<br>
