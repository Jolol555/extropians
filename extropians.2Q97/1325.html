<i>&gt; How can rational people expect to make good investments in</i><br>
<i>&gt; an irrational economy?</i><br>
<p>
Good question, and my personal approach is to invest in those<br>
people--and a corporation is only as good as the people who<br>
control it--who exhibit the most rational behavior, because it is<br>
the rational minds of people that will overcome many of the evils<br>
of the present system.<br>
<p>
I invest in companies that produce quality products, that do not<br>
do much business with the government or lobby for legislation,<br>
that look to the next century instead of the next quarter, etc.<br>
Since almost no company isn't without a few faults, one can<br>
approximate this by investing in the market broadly /minus/ those<br>
companies who commit the most heinous offenses: regulated<br>
monopolies like utilities, military contractors, the government<br>
itself of course (don't buy treasuries), industries that rely on<br>
subsidies like recyclers, and industries with big lobbies.<br>
