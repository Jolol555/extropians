<i>&gt; &gt; } Apparently, at least one member of this select circle has not</i><br>
upgraded to a<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; } browser that can read HTML. In an attempt to please a possible</i><br>
minority of<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; } one (at least until he upgrades) I'll write in plain script.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As a twelve year Internet veteran, let me first correct your terminology:</i><br>
<i>&gt; all "browsers" read HTML; that's their job.  Some of them also read mail,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which isn't their job, but many people think it is.  Email has been</i><br>
<i>&gt; around for a lot longer than the web has, and has developed its own</i><br>
<i>&gt; standards over time to allow interchange between the millions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems supporting it, hundreds of thousands of which have never even</i><br>
<i>&gt; heard of HTML.  Email programs support lots of features that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; developed over those years to make email more powerful and useful.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Many browsers fail to support many of those features, and instead like</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make up their own standards outside of the Internet community so</i><br>
<i>&gt; they can brag about "features" that have already been available in</i><br>
<i>&gt; standardized forms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; HTML is not and has never been a valid format for email.  It has</i><br>
<i>&gt; never been endorsed by any standards organization, it is not supported</i><br>
<i>&gt; by most serious email programs, and is a serious waste of bandwidth</i><br>
<i>&gt; and nuisance to those of us who use real email programs.  The MIME</i><br>
<i>&gt; format "text/enriched" /is/ a valid format, and less intrusive, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; understood by real email programs (but not, alas, by the idiots who</i><br>
<i>&gt; write Netscape mail and MS Exchange, so it should still be avoided).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All communication requires standards.  Without them, one would have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to tailor every communication to its specific audience, which is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; impossible state of affairs the standards were created to avoid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Where the standards fail, expanding them is justified.  But where they</i><br>
<i>&gt; work well, and have worked well for years, flagrantly violating them</i><br>
<i>&gt; is pointless and rude.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; P.S. Thanks for the opportunity to expand ny Web page's rant about</i><br>
<i>&gt; standards.  The email nonsense hadn't occurred to me at the time. :)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Dear fellow Extropians,<br>
The point as to a lack of standards is duly noted and is being taken under <br>
constructive advisement.<br>
In the interest of peace (and a possible -- but unlikely -- end to petty<br>
quibbling) hereafter I'll use plain script. (At least until someone adopts<br>
and impliments a uniform standard for the transmission of E-mail)<br>
<p>
I appreciate all constructive suggestions.<br>
Thank you,<br>
<p>
A.M. Genen <br>
