<i>&gt;         A couple of weeks ago, we had the opportunity to thumb through a weekly</i><br>
<i>&gt; American magazine called TIME, perhaps you have heard of it.  It is filled</i><br>
<i>&gt; with short, shallow articles on a variety of topics.  </i><br>
<p>
Yes, it is however a good measure of what pap is popular with the<br>
public, and what sort of disinformation they are being fed by the<br>
establishmentia.<br>
<p>
One article was about<br>
<i>&gt; encryption for computers which would make it too expensive for the State to</i><br>
<i>&gt; break.  This was tied in with E-Money being the new world currency.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Scenario:  With encryption on our PC we have secrecy concerning our</i><br>
<i>&gt; financial affairs if we use E-Money.  The spread of E-Money will break the</i><br>
<i>&gt; STATE/BANKS and their monopoly on the money supply.  It will also cause the</i><br>
<i>&gt; collapse of governments because of the vastly increased underground economy</i><br>
<i>&gt; which cannot be taxed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         The  author seemed to be unaware that the STATE could very easily tax</i><br>
<i>&gt; something that cannot be hidden, such as real estate, which they do</i><br>
<i>&gt; already.  So the STATE might be thwarted in attacking production and merely</i><br>
<i>&gt; take its share of the "action" via the spot where our home or business is</i><br>
<i>&gt; located.  The BANKS would lose their nice marriage to the STATE and would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to compete on the open market.  With property tax, people get one tax</i><br>
<i>&gt; bill, no forms to fill out, just a bill marked "Pay this amount....."</i><br>
<i>&gt; Renters pay with greatly increased rent.  Businesses use property</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiently.  Land speculation goes bust.  Property values drop.  The only</i><br>
<i>&gt; way out of paying taxes is to have your home or business off of STATE</i><br>
<i>&gt; controlled real estate.  (although the effect of taxes, reflected in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher cost of goods and services, would still be experienced).</i><br>
<p>
Being a resident of a State (New Hampshire) which derives roughly 2/3 of<br>
its tax revenues from property taxes, I think I can comment on this with<br>
some authority (we also have no income or sales tax, though there is a<br>
rooms and meals tax, a professional services tax, cigarette taxes, as<br>
well as state lottery and state control of liquor sales). If I<br>
illustrate my own situation at the moment I think you can uderstand the<br>
economic impacts.<br>
<p>
I accept temporary design, CAD, webauthoring, and desktop publishing<br>
jobs, and average between $10-15 per hour, though 1/3 of my time is free<br>
between jobs. I'm paying about 10% of my income to uncle sam in income<br>
taxes, plus about 15% in everything else (SS, WC, etc..) Business is<br>
starting to pick up as this area begins to become more computerized.<br>
<p>
I live in Lebanon, NH, a city of 12,000 on the Conneticutt river, with<br>
immediately to the north, Hanover, NH, home of Dartmouth College. The<br>
area has a total of 45,000 people in mostly rural surroundings. We are<br>
one hour from Concord NH, and two from the Massachusetts border. We<br>
currently have very low unemployment, estimated at around 2.5% or less.<br>
There are three pages plus of help wanted ads in the paper.<br>
<p>
Rent on a one room apartment varies through the area, but here in<br>
Lebanon, rent typically is between $400-600 per month. Electricity costs<br>
are $0.10 per kWh with comparably high heating oil and propane costs<br>
(natural gas is not available). Property taxes are around $4,000 on a<br>
$110,000 house annually. This $110,000 house I am using is in an upper<br>
middle class neighborhood, has 2,200 square feet and is on a 3/4 acre<br>
lot on top of a hill with a great view. The house has a septic system<br>
rather than sewage, has a paved driveway with a 2 car garage, 2<br>
bathrooms and four bedrooms.<br>
<p>
THere are towns with much lower property tax rates, but about the only<br>
thing to do in those areas is spiking deer out of season and incest with<br>
your sisters.<br>
<p>
Culturally, there is little to do, except for what is available at<br>
Dartmouth, though the local opera house has regular musical<br>
performances, and the small six plex theatre at the local mall. Being on<br>
the NH/VT border, Lebanon has a huge amount of shopping centers (VT has<br>
an 8% sales tax) and retail space ranges from $10-20 per square foot.<br>
The intersection of Interstates 89 and 91 right across the river help<br>
funnel Vermont and Quebecois shoppers to our area.<br>
<p>
As for government, NH has the largest legislative body in the world, so<br>
with a state population of just over 1,000,000 representatives still<br>
have a close relationship with their constituents, (I know at least one<br>
of mine personally) and they only get paid $400 per year plus gas money<br>
to do their jobs, and are only in session for I beleive two months of<br>
the year. The state tax burden, when measured as a percentage of income,<br>
is second lowest only to Alaska, I beleive, and we used to be first in<br>
the country. Its around 2.5-3.0% of income.<br>
<p>
We also have the lowest expenditures per student on education in the<br>
country, yet consistently score in the top 5% of states on SAT tests (we<br>
were once first for several years running, when our expenditures were at<br>
their lowest rate).<br>
<p>
As for the cost of living, I would say that a single person needs to<br>
make at least $8.50 an hour just to tread water around here. My little<br>
brother makes $15 an hour on average delivering pizza and is supporting<br>
his family of three and slowly getting ahead.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         That, my friends, suggests Cities, Floating on the Sea and in the Air.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Private Cities, which provide (no roads of course...who would need them?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; the structure for living, playing, working.  Cities, which compete by</i><br>
<i>&gt; giving better service for less.  Cities, which provide the space for</i><br>
<i>&gt; automated hydroponic farms.  Cities, freed from the STATE.  Cities,</i><br>
<i>&gt; providing all the variety or sameness one wishes.  (Although EXTROS,</i><br>
<i>&gt; midgets, and animal trainers would probably not find a City just for</i><br>
<i>&gt; them.....perhaps a neighborhood..........a BIG neighborhood, mind you...)</i><br>
<i>&gt; :-)</i><br>
<p>
Yes, when political power resides mainly in local bodies, the locality<br>
will be a direct reflection on those who weild power locally. Hanover, a<br>
white collar/intelligentsia/alumni town is quite progressive, while its<br>
bedroom hamlets of Etna and Lyme are extreme NIMBY practitioners of the<br>
rich and hermit celebrity sort.<br>
Lebanon is more average, with a normal level of buddy buddy corruption<br>
in city gov't, with a cultural impasse between natives and Taxachusetts<br>
carpetbaggers.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;         Well, we can just let our imagination run rampant with orgasmic joy at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes to be wrought by the creation of a tool for war.  (The Internet, of</i><br>
<i>&gt; course.)  It looks like it is going to eat its MAKER.  My, my...the times</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are a changin...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
