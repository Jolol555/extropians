A few years ago there was a male student at UC Berkeley who attended<br>
classes in the nude. He was eventually persuaded to put on some shorts,<br>
not on legal grounds but on the grounds that seats he had sat in were no<br>
longer sanitary.<br>
<p>
As an attendee of various neopagan events which are clothing optional I<br>
have to say that the novelty wears out very quickly. The usual reasons<br>
for clothing - protection and self expression will continue to<br>
apply.....<br>
<p>
Privately, as an owner of a hot tub, it is easy to get people to disrobe<br>
- just offer them something worthwhile, like the warm water...<br>
