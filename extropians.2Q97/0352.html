Ick. Unless it's a damn sight better than the MPEG CD-is I've seen I'll <br>
be sticking with Hi8.<br>

Serves ESCOM right. When I bought my laptop from them I had to wait six<br>
weeks for them to get one which worked, then take it back for a<br>
replacement because they left off the CPU heatsink and it continually<br>
overheated, and they told me they'd have some more RAM for me a couple of<br>
weeks after I bought it. Nine months later I finally found a RAM card for<br>
it in Taipei... <br>

Why not? Sounds like a good price to me; just delete NT and install Linux <br>
instead.<br>

Bad, bad, bad. I don't want my browser downloading pages which I didn't<br>
choose to look at, because I don't want to end up in access logs unless I<br>
have to. I get more than enough junk mail as it is. And just think of the<br>
problems if someone links from a popular page to a legal Dutch porn site<br>
with images which would count as 'child porn' in America, or to an<br>
American crypto ftp site. People looking at those pages would be breaking<br>
the law purely by accident as their browsers go off and download the <br>
illegal data for them. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; from skies seems a better choice, though. Speaking of that,</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;From what I was reading last week British Rail have been testing video by </i><br>
GSM. AFAIR it uses four GSM channels and only gives two or three frames <br>
per second, but that's good enough for the security cameras they want to <br>
install on trains. Presumably if you could afford to use 40 GSM channels <br>
at once you could send 25fps.<br>

<i>&gt; Digital photography has taken wing, silver stock will definitely not</i><br>
<i>&gt; be a good future investment.</i><br>
<p>
Do color films use silver? Anyway, we have a long way to go before film<br>
becomes obsolete; my $700 35mm camera gives about five times the linear<br>
resolution (twenty-five times as many 'pixels') of any similar priced<br>
digital camera. So digital is great for snapshots and advertising photos<br>
with a short turnaround time (e.g. real estate agents, used car ads), but<br>
at the moment it's lousy for real photography. <br>
