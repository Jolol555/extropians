Yes, I do care. Bandwidth to display is dear, has latency, and is not <br>
under my control, but that of the cell RF connectivity provider. Distance <br>
matters in a relativistic universe. A CM-5 at home is useless for me in <br>
the field (not exactly useless, let's say complementary). I sure will let <br>
my linux box run permanently, so I can log on via telent and PPP both. <br>
A laptop with a cellmodem is a good thing to have in the field.<br>

True, so what?<br>
<p>

<p>
If it works for you... Can I drive a MDM from home, over a 9.6 kBaud link?<br>
  <br>

<p>
Why not? With a good headup, I can read while walking on the street.  I<br>
can let the machine read my mail, and dictate responses. There is lots of<br>
small, irritating waits which can be utilized much better. Making tree<br>
killing obsolete is impossible without a good head-up, and a head tracker,<br>
and both are impossible without a wearable. I'd kill for a good wearable.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and Nokia PC-card I can do web browsing anywhere, and it gives me a</i><br>

Me, I simply don't get mad. But the Newt2000 is just an expensive toy.<br>

<p>
Speak for yourself. Working in the park, in the meadow, in the mountains. <br>
Untethered.<br>
<p>
People yearn for wearables. They just don't know it yet. Now this is a <br>
challenge for marketing.<br>
