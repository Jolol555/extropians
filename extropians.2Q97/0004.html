Maybe I'm misunderstanding you two.  What I hear is "We no longer need<br>
centralized military coordination because we can just run away when<br>
attacked."  But this seems crazy to me.  Even if a single firm loses<br>
30-50% of their value in such a move, groups of firms could lose much<br>
more if they failed to coordinate to all move to the same place in<br>
such a way as to preserve their business relations (based in part on<br>
geographic proximity).  Also, individuals would lose houses and<br>
personal possessions, communities would lose roads, shopping centers,<br>
etc.  It seems to me we are far from the point where the losses from<br>
moving are less than the losses from defending via central military<br>
coordination.<br>
