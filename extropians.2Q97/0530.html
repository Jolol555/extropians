Anyone notice an "urban legend awareness" meme lately?  A.K.A. the "Here's<br>
something else that didn't really happen" meme or the "Be careful what you<br>
THINK you know" meme.<br>
<p>
It's either:<br>
<p>
A. Just me.<br>
<p>
-or-<br>
<p>
B. There is a lot more awareness of urban myths and legends lately.<br>
<p>
The "urban" from urban legend comes from the idea that it is in the cities<br>
where there are a large number of people to spread them (transmitters or<br>
"vectors").  The same happens in the corporate workplace where there are a<br>
lot of people.  And, now with the Internet there are a lot of people sharing<br>
info and spreading stories, some of which are urban myths, for example see<br>
the following list of urban myths that are false.  My theory is that the<br>
Internet has also facilitated the spread of the "Here's something else that<br>
didn't really happen" meme.<br>
<p>
<p>
* The criminal ring of highly-skilled surgeons who steal kidneys from<br>
unsuspecting victims to sell on the black market.<br>
<p>
* The homosexual act of sending a gerbil (or hamster) up a toilet-paper tube<br>
in the anus.<br>
<p>
* The helicopter that fights forest fires by scooping water from lake.<br>
Charred body of scuba diver found in ashes.<br>
<p>
* People occasionally spontaneously combust and burn to death.<br>
<p>
* The razor blade in the Halloween apples and other Halloween candy-tampering.<br>
<p>
* Snuff films exist.<br>
<p>
* There are satanic symbols on the Proctor &amp; Gamble logo.<br>
<p>
* Numerous Internet virus hoaxes.<br>
<p>
* Suicide rates go up around the holidays.<br>
<p>
* Domestic violence goes up on Super Bowl Sunday.<br>
<p>
* People are much loonier (e.g., shoot, screw, etc.) during a full moon.<br>
<p>
* "Blue star" or cartoon character (esp. Mickey Mouse) tattoos laced with<br>
LSD is sold at schools to hook kids on acid.<br>
<p>
* There was a fried rat served in a Kentucky-Fried Chicken restaurant.<br>
<p>
* Aspirin and Coca-Cola taken together get you high. (Nope. May cause insomnia.)<br>
<p>
* Henry Ford/Gen. Douglas McArthur/T. Edison/IBM Rep./et al. tests an<br>
interviewee by when they salt their food during lunch.<br>
<p>
* Albert Einstein did poorly in school.<br>
<p>
* We only use 10% of our brain.<br>
<p>
* NASA did experiement on making love in zero gravity.<br>
<p>
* No two snowflakes are alike.<br>
<p>
<p>
And here is an urban legend that is true:<br>
<p>
Disney parks are riddled with secret tunnels and surveillance equipment. <br>
