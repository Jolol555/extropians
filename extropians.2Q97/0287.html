 often in the past I'd spoken to people who would talk and talk<br>
<i>&gt; about 'ego', but when I asked them what they meant by the word they</i><br>
umm-ed<br>
<i>&gt; and ahh-ed and failed to define it. They talk about this thing, they</i><br>
claim<br>
<i>&gt; to have one, but don't actually know what it is. </i><br>
<p>
	That appears to be "normal" for humans, does it not?  Can we not see the<br>
same thing happening on this list when it comes to "mysticism"; i.e.;<br>
judgement made without examination?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Would you suggest that Socrates' admonition to "Know thyself." </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; applies in this 	modern age?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes. Why shouldn't it? </i><br>
<p>
	Would "knowing" oneself be useful as a prelude to re-programming?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	What do you consider "ego nonsense"?</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The fact that we all like to regard ourselves as somehow better than we</i><br>
<i>&gt; really are. Even the most deranged killers think that they have a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; reason for what they do. </i><br>
<p>
	Isn't this an almost universal trait of humans to self-justify?<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	How would someone "know" they were seeing themselves as they "truly</i><br>
are?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because their internal model of themselves would match their actions. If,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, I was to go around telling everyone that I was going to be a famous</i><br>
<i>&gt; writer yet I never wrote anything, then I would clearly have an ego</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem and would never attain my goal until I solved it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	How does seeing oneself as one truly is, help to see your life the</i><br>
same<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; way 	any other individual sees their own life?</i><br>
	<br>
	This question was in response to..."Probably, you already saw your life <br>
differently from the way any of us see our lives."<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Uh, can you start that question again? </i><br>
<p>
	Since all humans have different values, world-views, etc. they would each<br>
see their lives as they are; uniquely different.  It would not be<br>
reasonable to expect any two individuals to have the same life, or to even<br>
share the same world-view, would it?<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Do you think you are 'just' a computer?</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; There's no neurophysiological evidence to think otherwise, unless the</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum mechanical effects in the brain are truly significant. You cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; conclusively prove that we don't have 'souls', but there seems little</i><br>
<i>&gt; point when the vast majority of human behaviour can be explained without</i><br>
<i>&gt; them. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Is this just another way of simplifying humans?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't really understand the question, but if anything I'd say it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; another way of complexifying humans. Claiming that we're 'souls' in</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical bodies is a much greater simplification. If we accept that we</i><br>
are<br>
<i>&gt; computers then exploring the precise details of our operation will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; extremely complex. Frankly I find the idea of humans as computers far</i><br>
more<br>
<i>&gt; bizzare and puzzling than the idea of humans as immortal souls incarnated</i><br>
<i>&gt; in flesh. </i><br>
	Have you studied anatomy and physiology yet?   The point being, that when<br>
humans began making and using machines extensively, they had a mechanistic<br>
view of the Universe, including bodies.  Now they appear to be doing the<br>
same with the body, which has to be a gross over-simplification of this<br>
very complex item.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nope. It's not something you can tell to anyone; they have to go out and</i><br>
<i>&gt; find it for themselves, though you could point them in the right</i><br>
direction<br>
<i>&gt; as the Buddhists try to do. You'll just have to trust that the switch</i><br>
<i>&gt; exists and go hunting for yours by yourself. Anyone who claims that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; can tell you how to do it is trying to sell a religion. </i><br>
<p>
		This sounds consistent with our experience. :-)<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Because 100% bliss would require that I shut down all processing in my</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain except for the bliss-circuits. I've never been there, but I've been</i><br>
<i>&gt; close. </i><br>
<p>
	If you have never "been there", you don't really "know" what 100% Bliss<br>
requires, do you?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Been there, done that. I sort of agree if you use 'letting in god' in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense of Crowley's 'true will'. A lot of mystics have talked about moving</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of the way and letting 'god' work thru them. This seems to be what</i><br>
<i>&gt; they're talking about; the idea that 'god' created us with our 'true</i><br>
<i>&gt; wills/true natures' and that the way to follow the 'will of god' is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; find your 'true will' and follow that. </i><br>
<p>
	It also sounds like Joseph Campbells' "follow your bliss".<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Seems about right to me, but this depends mostly on motivation. Many</i><br>
<i>&gt; people set out to change habits but don't have the motivation to do so</i><br>
<i>&gt; properly or are so stuck in their social role that the people they</i><br>
<i>&gt; interact with won't let them. It's just a matter of repeating the new</i><br>
<i>&gt; behaviour until the new pathways through the brain's neural network take</i><br>
<i>&gt; over and the old ones rot away through disuse. </i><br>
	<br>
	We have seen this too.  Perhaps if they first understood themselves, they<br>
would also understand their habits.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Do you know of a modern, scientific, rational form of mysticism?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Crowley's Thelema is the closest that I know of, though the Chaos</i><br>
<i>&gt; Magickians might qualify. Of course Crowley never did get the hang of</i><br>
<i>&gt; ego-loss himself, much to his chagrin. </i><br>
<p>
	"...chagrin..."   disappointment....comes from expectation....this<br>
explains why he "never did get the hang of ego-loss"<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; 	Do you know of any mystical scientists, living or dead?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Didn't Crowley study Chemistry at Cambridge? I think someone already</i><br>
<i>&gt; mentioned Newton, and various 20th century scientists have had some kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of mystic beliefs. Do Leary and Lilly count?</i><br>
<p>
	Of course.  We were just checking. :-)<br>
