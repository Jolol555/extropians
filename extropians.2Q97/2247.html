<p>
That's a very noble idea but it's not quite that simple in a typical <br>
Prisoner's Dilemma situation. Suppose that if you and your partner you can't <br>
communicate with both cooperate then you both get 10 days in jail,  if you <br>
both defect then you both get 10 years in jail, if your partner  cooperates <br>
and you defect then you go home today with no jail time at all,  and if your<br>
partner defects and you cooperates then you get 50 years in jail.<br>
<p>
Obviously to minimize the total amount of time anybody spends in jail the  <br>
best strategy would be for everybody to cooperate, and if there was some way <br>
to form a binding agreement with my fellow prisoner I most certainly would, <br>
BUT  there is no way to communicate or influence what the other prisoner will  <br>
choose to do, and regardless of what he does I'm always better off if I <br>
defect. <br>
<p>
When I say "better off" I assume I don't love your fellow prisoner, if I did  <br>
my strategy would change dramatically, but you must take that love as an <br>
axiom, you can't derive it from the prisoners dilemma. At least you can't <br>
derive it at a level as high as the individual, at the gene level perhaps.    <br>
                     <br>
