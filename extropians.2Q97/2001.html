<i>&gt; From: Hagbard Celine &lt;hagbard@ix.netcom.com&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; I am definitely missing something. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How can an anarchist speak of law or legal systems? </i><br>
<p>
Easily. Many places and times have operated without states but with<br>
legal systems. Law does not require a State, any more than building<br>
roads or delivering mail requires a State.<br>
<p>
In medieval Europe, commercial law was entirely developed in private<br>
courts without any power of state based enforcement behind them -- and<br>
yet it worked well, and the Lex Mercatoria is the basis for all modern<br>
commercial law.<br>
<p>
In medieval Iceland, there was no "public" law enforcement at all --<br>
all law enforcement was private. And yet, there was law.<br>
<p>
If you want to learn more on this topic, I suggest "The Machinery of<br>
Freedom" by Friedman and "The Enterprise of Law" by Benson as good<br>
starting points.<br>
