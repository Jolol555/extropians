WHO CITES WORLDWIDE INCREASE IN HUMAN LONGEVITY<br>
The United Nations World Health Organization reports that<br>
average life expectancy is now 64 years in developing countries<br>
and 80 years in some industrialized nations, with the overall<br>
population of people older than 65 likely to grow by 82 per cent<br>
in the next 25 years, compared with 46 per cent in the working<br>
age population, and only 3 per cent in newborns. The WHO 1997<br>
report also details the increased incidence in developing<br>
countries of diseases usually associated with the industrialized<br>
nations: heart disease, stroke, and cancer.<br>
(Chicago Tribune 5 May)<br>
<p>
RUSSIAN DEATH RATE RISING WHILE BIRTHS DECLINE<br>
Recent studies indicate Russia is facing a demographic crisis<br>
due to a rising death rate and falling birth rate. It appears<br>
that Russian demographic indicators have dropped from those of a<br>
developed country to those of so-called Third World countries.<br>
Deaths in 1995 increased to 2.2 million from 1.4 million in<br>
1989, while births in 1995 declined to 1.4 million from 2.2<br>
million in 1989. A recent report of an advisory board to Boris<br>
Yeltsin states that in 1995 Russia's death rate was higher than<br>
in any European or North or South American country, and higher<br>
than in most Asian and African states, while in 1989 death rates<br>
were at the average European level. (Chicago Tribune 5 May)<br>
<p>
COMPANY OBTAINS PATENT FOR SKIN CANCER MELANOMA GENE<br>
Under present U.S. and European patent law it is possible to<br>
obtain a patent on a human gene in the same manner as one<br>
obtains a patent on a chemical compound. Myriad Genetics, the<br>
Salt Lake City company that has two patents pending for breast<br>
cancer genes (BRC-1 and BRCA-2), has now received a patent for<br>
the gene it claims causes melanoma (Multiple Tumor Suppressor 1<br>
or MTS1), and for the method of testing for the presence of that<br>
gene in humans. Lisa Cannon-Albright, a University of Utah<br>
geneticist, Mark Skolnik, a Myriad geneticist, and Alexander<br>
Kamb, a Myriad molecular biologist are listed as the inventors.<br>

SYNTHESIS OF A NEW POLYMER THAT LOWERS BLOOD CHOLESTEROL<br>
Ordinary cholesterol-lowering drugs either interfere directly<br>
with cholesterol metabolism or introduce changes in the<br>
sequestration of cholesterol in the blood. A Massachussetts<br>
company, Geltex Pharmaceuticals Inc., has now patented a polymer<br>
compound it claims can be taken orally to draw cholesterol out<br>
of the bloodstream. The polymer, which is not absorbed into the<br>
bloodstream, sequesters cholesterol in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract, preventing exogenous or endogenous cholesterol from being<br>
absorbed. In high-blood-cholesterol patients, the liver is thus<br>
induced to use more available cholesterol to make bile acids<br>
with a resultant lowering in blood cholesterol. The bile acids<br>
are sent to the intestine, where their cholesterol is<br>
sequestered by the polymer and prevented from returning to the<br>
bloodstream. Three Geltex scientists, W. Harry Mandeville, S.<br>
Randall Holmes-Farley, and John S. Petersen received the patent.<br>
(New York Times 5 May)<br>
<p>
CHEMIST CITES CRISIS IN DISTRIBUTION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION<br>
Alexandru T. Balaban, Professor of Organic Chemistry at the<br>
University of Bucharest, argues that current methods of<br>
distributing scientific information have caused critical<br>
hardship to research workers in most countries of the world. In<br>
Romania, for example, the only complete collection of *Chemical<br>
Abstracts* exists in the capital city, Bucharest, although<br>
universities and chemical research institutes are located in<br>
five other cities. Balaban cites the paradox: Quality scientific<br>
information is being produced, but only a tiny fraction of the<br>
potential users can afford to buy and use this information. For<br>
example, the Houben-Weyl *Methoden der organischen Chemie*,<br>
important for any research in chemical synthesis, has more than<br>
50 volumes with each volume priced at approxiamtely $2000.<br>
Recent volumes are practically unavailable, and many libraries<br>
have stopped subscribing to the well-known Gmelin and Beilstein<br>
series as well. Balaban concludes that a completely new approach<br>
to the dissemination of scientific information is badly needed,<br>
perhaps an approach utilizing the current interconnections<br>
available via the Internet. (American Scientist June 1997)<br>

NATIONAL ACADEMY MEMBER REVISITS NAS REJECTION OF CARL SAGAN<br>
Jared Diamond, a member of the U.S. National Academy of<br>
Sciences, an elected honorary society and advisory group to the<br>
U.S. Government, discusses the hostility of most scientists to<br>
colleagues who popularize science, an apparent paradox, since<br>
most scientists recognize the need to keep the public informed<br>
about science. Diamond considers in detail the problem of the<br>
rejection of recently deceased Carl Sagan by the Academy several<br>
years ago. Although Sagan's research was considered important<br>
enough so that he was nominated in the first place, his<br>
nomination was challenged on the floor, and the two-thirds<br>
majority required following such a challenge could not be<br>
obtained. Diamond states his belief that Sagan was rejected<br>
because of his efforts to popularize science, and that young<br>
scientists have been therefore warned they risk ruining their<br>
careers if they spend time communicating science to the general<br>
public. (Discover May 1997)<br>

NOVEL PATTERNS OF CANCER IN AIDS PATIENTS<br>
It is perhaps to be expected that any disease or therapy that<br>
interferes with the operation of the human immune system will<br>
produce new spectra of associated diseases. At a recent<br>
international meeting devoted to AIDS and cancer, held in<br>
Bethesda MD, and sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer<br>
Institute, studies were reported that show an increasing<br>
incidence of various types of cancers in people infected with<br>
the HIV virus that causes AIDS. The classic cancers associated<br>
with AIDS are Kaposi's Sarcoma (skin and internal organs),<br>
non-Hodgkins lymphoma (lymph system), squamous cell of the<br>
conjunctiva of the eye, and in situ carcinomas of the cervix and<br>
and anus. Now three other cancers are appearing in AIDS<br>
patients: Hodgkin's disease (lymph system), plasmocytoma (blood<br>
system), and leiomyosarcoma (muscle), and studies have also<br>
suggested increases in the incidence of lung, lip, testicular,<br>
and other cancers. One critical question is whether the<br>
increased incidence of these HIV-associated cancers is due to<br>
the effects of HIV on the immune system or to the affects of the<br>
chemotherapeutic regimes on the immune system and/or other<br>
systems. That question remains to be settled. Another puzzle is<br>
that the new cancers associated with AIDS apparently differ in<br>
different geographical regions, some cancers appearing in the<br>
U.S. and Europe and not in Africa, and vice versa. The important<br>
consideration is that studies of AIDS, cancer, and immunology<br>
are fast coalescing into a unitary research entity.<br>

NEW CALCULATION OF HUBBLE CONSTANT APPEARS TO RESOLVE PARADOX<br>
There has been a recent puzzle concerning the apparent age of<br>
the universe and the apparent age of the oldest stars. Recent<br>
data have suggested the universe is younger than the oldest<br>
stars by a few billion years, which of course produces a<br>
paradox. Now Simon Goodwin and John Gribbin at Sussex, working<br>
with Martin Hendry in Glasgow, have devised and applied a new<br>
method for estimating the age of the universe that apparently<br>
resolves the paradox. The key to establishing the age of the<br>
universe is the numerical value of the Hubble Constant (H). What<br>
Goodwin, Gribbin, and Hendry have done is to deduce the value of<br>
the Hubble Constant that must obtain if the average sizes of a<br>
number of galaxies are to be statistically in harmony with the<br>
average known sizes of other nearby galaxies whose distances are<br>
now measurable with the Hubble Space Telescope. Once its distance is<br>
known, the size of a galaxy can be measured by red shift analysis. The<br>
new deduced result for the Hubble Constant puts the age of the<br>
universe at 13 billion years, and since the latest data for the oldest<br>
stars indicates their age at 12 billion years, the stellar<br>
chronological paradox is apparently resolved. (Communicated by<br>

VIRAL SABOTAGE CONFUSES THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM<br>
Elucidation of the methods of combat in the ongoing war between<br>
viruses and cells is one of the more fascinating areas of<br>
biological research. Certain viruses have been shown to harpoon<br>
cells with proteins to facilitate translocation of the virus<br>
into the cell interior. Now there is evidence that once inside<br>
the cell, viruses can take control of the protein synthetic<br>
machinery responsible for putting out protein marker posts on<br>
the cell surface that tell immune system cells whether the cell<br>
has been invaded. By sabotaging the marker post production, the<br>
invading virus controls the type of marker posts produced and<br>
fools the immune system into believing the cell intact and<br>
without pathogen visitors. The immune system does not destroy<br>
such cells, and the virus is allowed to continue its<br>
intracellular replication. (New York Times 6 May)<br>

CLOCK GENES: LINK BETWEEN RESPONSES TO LIGHT AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS<br>
Many organisms exhibit daily (circadian) rhythms, cyclical variations<br>
in various bodily functions, metabolisms, etc., even in constant light<br>
or constant darkness. Such biological clocks are most easily studied<br>
in simple organisms. Now Susan K. Crosthwaite, et al, of the<br>
Department of Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover NH, have<br>
shown that certain clock genes in the fungus Neurospora are also<br>
involved in the production of proteins necessary for the organism's<br>
response to light, suggesting that circadian oscillators in more<br>
complex organisms evolved from light-regulated pathways in simpler<br>
organisms. (Science 2 May)<br>
