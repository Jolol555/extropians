I wouldn't think so.  Presumably this is related to reproductive success,<br>
since it gets worse after puberty.  Chimpanzees raised as humans generally do<br>
OK until puberty but become intractable afterwards.  While aggression,<br>
dominance games, and shirking work would probably help a monkey's<br>
reproduction, it's going to be counterproductive for an AI, at least as long<br>
as AIs depend on humans for reproduction.  Long domestication tends to make<br>
animals more docile (e.g. dogs vs. wolves) and AIs will presumably start out<br>
docile, from both design goals and (presumably) little need for<br>
self-motivation in the early stages.<br>
