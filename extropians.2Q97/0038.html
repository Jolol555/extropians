All the talk about cognition and emotion got me thinking as to the role<br>
that emotions play in humans and the role emotions could play in a computer<br>
(not an upload).  <br>
<p>
With human beings, and other animals, emotions are simply the equavalient<br>
of commands or instructions.  Without emotion, a human being is nothing. <br>
Contrary to what some think, there is no grand meaning of life that<br>
trancends beyond the merely human.  There is no such thing as pure<br>
rationality.  Without emotion, one would not care whether one existed or<br>
not.  Since a person with no emotion would have no reason to do anything,<br>
not even a reason to think, they would, for all practical purposes, be<br>
quite dead.<br>
<p>
Computers, on the other hand, are given instructions, in my opinion just<br>
simplified emotions. These instructions motivate the computer to do<br>
something.  Without instruction, the computer does nothing and for all<br>
practically purposes, can be considered inactive.  The computer without<br>
instruction and the human without emotion produce the same output, nothing.<br>
<p>
It is agreed that at least some other animals have emotion.  Therefore,<br>
emotion must have evolved in a continuum.  Bacteria obviously do not have<br>
emotion while human beings obviously do.  As the creatures become more<br>
complex, more complex control mechanisms are nescesary.  Hence the<br>
evolution from mere instruction, or instinct, to emotions.<br>
<p>
With computers the brain power of insects we have no need to program<br>
emotion.  As computers become more powerful and are entrusted with more<br>
tasks, the instructions we give them will probably start to look more and<br>
more like emotions.  You can easily imagine a robot scurrying away from an<br>
explosion, or even from a loud noise (cockroach level).  Think of a<br>
computer in increasing complex scenarios and they may show even more<br>
behavior indicative of emotion.  The simulation of emotions is all that is<br>
need to have emotions.  This is simply the emotive equivalent of the Turing<br>
test.<br>
