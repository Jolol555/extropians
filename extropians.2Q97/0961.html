&lt;&lt; <br>
 Is there anything that a vegan is in danger of missing? Do I need to<br>
 suppliment my diet, or are there naturally occuring provdiders?<br>
<i>  &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Nope, u can get more protein from beans than from meat.  Vegan diet gives you<br>
so much nutrition its crazy.  The only thing better is a noncooked,, organic,<br>
living foods diet.  I go for milk too though.  Proper food combining is a<br>
must too, drink water before eating fruit before veggies before grains.<br>
You know what the worst food combination is?  Meat and potatoes.  The<br>
chemicals in each cancel out the digestive chemicals in your stomach,<br>
becoming undigestibabl and rotting in your stomach and intestines for a day<br>
like it was sitting in the hot sun.<br>
