Well, it seems to be done by resurrecting the last of the classical <br>
economists Henry George.  Toward the end of the 1800's, he wrote a book <br>
called _Progress and Poverty_ ( available online at <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.henrygeorge.org/pplink.htm">http://www.henrygeorge.org/pplink.htm</a>&gt; ) which sold 3 million copies <br>
and sparked off the progressive movement.  It provides subtle arguments <br>
against Marx and not-so-subtle arguments against Malthus.  The strict <br>
georgist libertarianism of the kind that Henry George advocated can be <br>
seen espoused at the Dan's Geolibertarian Home Page <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.geolib.pair.com">http://www.geolib.pair.com</a>&gt; which has a page called "Greens and <br>
Libertarians:  The yin and yang of our political future"<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.geolib.pair.com/essays/sullivan.dan/greenlibertarians.html">http://www.geolib.pair.com/essays/sullivan.dan/greenlibertarians.html</a>&gt; <br>
which I highly recommend.  The progressive libertarian caucus within <br>
the Democratic Party of the US known as the Democratic Freedom Caucus <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.progress.org/dfc">http://www.progress.org/dfc</a>&gt; was founded by the same fellow that <br>
started the Maryland Chapter of the Green Party. <br>
<p>
But perhaps I'm putting the cart before the horse.  Let's get back to <br>
basics for a moment shall we.  First thing that you must understand <br>
when talking to Greens are the green values.  "The Original Ten Key <br>
Values of the Green Committees of Correspondence" with the questions <br>
used to clarify them can be found at &lt;<a href="http://www.greens.org/gcofc.html">http://www.greens.org/gcofc.html</a>&gt; <br>
and Harry Reid's response to them can be found on page <br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.atlantic.net/~dwatney/reid/reid01.htm">http://www.atlantic.net/~dwatney/reid/reid01.htm</a>&gt; in the section <br>
labeled "Libertarian and Green Values."  We are infinitely compatible <br>
movements with similar roots and understanding this will help us both <br>
get that much closer to reaching our goals.<br>
<p>
In liberty,<br>
