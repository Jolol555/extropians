    COLLEGEVILLE, Pa., April 9 /PRNewswire/ -- NanoSystems LLC today<br>
announced<br>
a three-year feasibility collaboration and license agreement with Warner-<br>
Lambert Company (NYSE: WLA), to develop new pharmaceuticals through the<br>
Parke-<br>
Davis Research division of Warner-Lambert Company.  Under the terms of the<br>
agreement, NanoSystems will apply its patented NanoCrystal(TM) drug<br>
formulation technology to develop nanoparticle formulations of proprietary<br>
Parke-Davis compounds for evaluation in preclinical and human clinical<br>
studies.  In return, NanoSystems will receive R&amp;D support, milestone<br>
payments,<br>
and royalties on sales of products incorporating NanoCrystal technology.<br>
          "NanoSystems' NanoCrystal formulations provide a means for<br>
improving<br>
delivery efficiency and clinical performance of drugs with low solubility,"<br>
said Larry A. Sternson, Ph.D., President and CEO of NanoSystems.  "The<br>
partnership with Warner-Lambert Company will result in the application of<br>
this<br>
technology in support of discovery and development of new drugs that because<br>
of the limited water solubility could not otherwise be developed."<br>
          Fred Hershenson, Ph.D., Sr. Vice President of Technical Development<br>
for<br>
Parke-Davis Research says he expects the collaboration with NanoSystems "will<br>
allow us to optimize formulations of poorly water soluble drugs to accelerate<br>
their development and commercialization.  By utilizing this technology at<br>
early stages of the R&amp;D process, we anticipate that the efficiency and speed<br>
of drug discovery will be significantly enhanced thereby reducing drug<br>
development cycle times."<br>
          Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Company, is devoted to<br>
discovering, developing, manufacturing and marketing quality pharmaceutical<br>
products.  Its central research focus is on heart disease, diabetes,<br>
infectious diseases, disorders of the central nervous system and women's<br>
healthcare.  Warner-Lambert Company is a worldwide company employing<br>
approximately 38,000 people, and along with Parke-Davis is headquartered in<br>
Morris Plains, New Jersey.<br>
          NanoSystems is applying its expertise in particulate/colloidal<br>
systems to<br>
improve drug delivery via a broad range of dosage forms and across all common<br>
routes of administration.  NanoSystems is collaborating with a number of<br>
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop improved formulations<br>
of<br>
both marketed products and new chemical entities.  To date, eight drugs<br>
incorporating the Company's  technology have been tested in human clinical<br>
trials.  The Company has over two dozen feasibility studies ongoing with<br>
various clients.  In addition to Warner-Lambert, the Company has license<br>
agreements with a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Merck &amp; Co.,<br>
Astra Draco AB, Mimetix Inc., and Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., a subsidiary of<br>
Johnson &amp; Johnson.<br>
