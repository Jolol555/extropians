<i>&gt;  Actually at the moment my model has constant creativity, and it is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  criticism which slides freely.  </i><br>
<p>
I think creativity is linked to the emotions, and higher levels of critical<br>
thought/logic are unemotional, numb, and dry. New ideas, original ideas, are<br>
not deductive, but result from a blending of many things... almost accidental<br>
pairings of unrrelated thoughts... like the guy who accidentally dipped his<br>
chocolate in peanut butter..What happens is that the creative moments are<br>
often unfocused, daydreamy moments...resulting in flashes of "AHA!" which may<br>
be very unclear and even unuseful,  but THEN the critical parts can go in and<br>
hone and perfect...<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;If you call random spew creativity,</i><br>
<p>
random spew is fine, it is EXPRESSIVE,  and can result in great Music, but it<br>
is not creation, creativity by defintion must hbe followed with product,<br>
 action or result..<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  I suspect that is what it must amount to under the hood. </i><br>
<p>
I don't understand that comment.<br>
<i>&gt; When you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tired you're not too focused, more ideas get through, you feel more</i><br>
<i>&gt;  creative, and some of them might even be good. </i><br>
<p>
Exactly - you are allowing your brain to flow to areas less ruled by logic<br>
and more by emotion: hence the new and odd combinations of peanut and<br>
chocolate slip through<br>
<p>
 When you're sleeping<br>
<i>&gt;  you're not focused at all and your mind goes on a random walk. </i><br>
<p>
And don't you get the most marvelous ideas then? i do... driving too...<br>
<p>
<i> &gt;That it  makes as much sense as it seems to do while you're asleep is</i><br>
probably<br>
<i>&gt;  due to our neural networks desperately trying to find patterns.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt;  you're too tightly focused and critical not enough ideas are allowed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;  live long enough.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Hallucinogens perhaps actively affect the creation of ideas, vs. simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;  tearing down the critical walls; I wouldn't know. </i><br>
<p>
So I hear! Very extropic!<br>
<p>
 For my purposes a<br>
<i>&gt;  constant source of idealets with varying intensity and quality of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  surrounding filters works as a model, so far.</i><br>
<p>
SOr tof backwards to what I would reccomend, but a good model if it works for<br>
you.<br>
  <br>
<i>&gt;  Smart people have more dumb ideas than dumb people, because dumb people</i><br>
<i>&gt;  don't have ideas.  Really smart people, of course, recognize their dumb</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ideas before they open their mouth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  That last sentence was not meant as a jibe at anyone specific.  </i><br>
<p>
O I C - OK, maybe I am not smart enough to worry about being dumb...or vice<br>
versa.. ; )<br>
Love, <br>
