IRS raids a cypherpunk<br>
by Declan McCullagh (declan@well.com)<br>
<p>
<p>
Jim Bell's first mistake was publishing an<br>
essay describing how disgruntled citizens could<br>
kill off Federal government agents by using<br>
anonymous betting pools and digital cash. His<br>
second mistake was informing the IRS that the<br>
agency had no legal authority to tax him.<br>
<p>
About twenty armed IRS agents and other<br>
Federal police swarmed into Bell's home in<br>
Washington state on Tuesday morning, hunting for<br>
evidence that Bell's "Assassination Politics"<br>
essay had come to fruition. They expropriated<br>
Bell's three computer systems, two guns and even<br>
a solitary mouse cable. The Feds were taking no<br>
chances: Since Bell's voluminous Net postings<br>
mentioned tax collectors, agents from the BATF,<br>
FBI, DEA, and local police forces joined the<br>
raid.<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<p>
The raid stemmed from a six-month tussle<br>
between Bell and the IRS, which began in November<br>
1996 when the 38-year old computer engineer<br>
demanded a hefty tax refund and threatened to<br>
convene his own "common-law court" if it was<br>
refused. That grabbed the Feds' attention. (So<br>
did the actions of the "Multnomah County Common<br>
Law Court," which apparently met in January to<br>
convict IRS agents and Attorney General Janet<br>
Reno of "theft by deception.") In February, IRS<br>
agents seized Bell's 1986 Honda as payment for<br>
back taxes -- and found inside it a printout of<br>
his "Assassination Politics" essay. "<br>
<p>
[...]<br>
<p>
And it was, ultimately, a Federal magistrate<br>
who signed the search warrant on 9:02 am on March<br>
28 at the request of the IRS. Jeffrey Gordon, an<br>
inspector in the IRS' Internal Security Division,<br>
details in an 10-page affidavit how he traced<br>
Bell's use of allegedly fraudulent Social<br>
Security Numbers, how he learned that Bell had<br>
been arrested in 1989 for "manufacturing a<br>
controlled substance," how he found out that Bell<br>
possessed the home addresses of a handful of IRS<br>
agents. Gordon's conclusion: Bell planned "to<br>
overthrow the government." The IRS investigator<br>
says in his affidavit that Bell's "essay details<br>
an illegal scheme by Bell which involves plans to<br>
assassinate IRS and other government officals...<br>
I believe that Bell has begun taking steps to<br>
carry out his Assassination Politics plan."<br>
