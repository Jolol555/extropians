     "Evolution is a pretty simple mathematical phenomenon once you<br>

     clear that immortality serves no purpose to a gene's survival,<br>
     and in fact is detrimental in many cases.  Once you're done<br>
     reproducing, your body is no longer useful to your genes' further<br>
     replication, so no evolutionary pressure to continue is present.<br>
     Evolution serves the replicators (genes, roughly speaking),<br>
     not organisms."<br>
     <br>
     My response:<br>
     <br>
     "This somehow triggered a "what if" that I'd like to muddle thru.  Is <br>
     it possible that the torch-bearer for millions of years of physical <br>
     evolution has been the gene.  With the fairly recent advent of <br>
     self-aware beings who have evolved consciously to a point of <br>
     themselves creating the first near-sentient life forms (our computers, <br>
     our eventual nanotechnological agents).  Could the torch possibly be <br>
     ready to pass from physical matter-bound immortality to a lighter <br>
     energy form?  <br>
     <br>
     We all fancy immortality or at least life extension with good quality <br>
     of life but I don't even think it would take a century for an immortal <br>
     to become quite weary of a matter-bound existence.  Granted, if the <br>
     majority were to become "immortal" in the physical sense, we'd likely <br>
     get a lot more done, with no preoccupation on time constraints or <br>
     energy spent fearing the limits of our own mortality.  <br>
     <br>
     Fundamentally, I think we ultimately want freedom and retention of <br>
     self-awareness, two things we perceive death robs us of.  (Whether it <br>
     does or not is answered individually for us post-mortem I suppose...if <br>
     we care...if we're still there to care...).  <br>
     <br>
     Living in the here and now, we can yammer on about quality of life, <br>
     quests for the stars, soundness of financial investments, exploiting <br>
     anything beneath us on the food/brain chain, yadda, yadda, yadda.  <br>
     It's all well and good, keeps the neurons firing and ideas <br>
     percolating, passes the time and provides intrigue and distraction.  <br>
     <br>
     But what if we as humans (or perhaps the posthuman motif of Extropian <br>
     design) have the transcendent mechanism to shift immortality from <br>
     physically-bound to an ethereal situation.  <br>
     <br>
     Don't know about some of you but being fabulously wealthy in a chateau <br>
     by the sea with plenty of servants and assured physical immortality <br>
     doesn't hold a candle to the ability to experience the consciousness <br>
     of an eagle over the mountains, a wave cresting, a thunderhead <br>
     culminating, a whale breaching, a redwood capturing a spring breeze, . <br>
      I could actually see spending even a fraction of eternity (lets say a <br>
     thousand millennia) instilling my matter-emancipated consciousness <br>
     into other physical manifestations and assimilating the "knowing" of <br>
     the experience into my being(acquiring experience, BTW, is what I've <br>
     assigned to be the meaning of life).  Experience is the ultimate <br>
     upload.  Matter-bound existence seriously limits the quality and <br>
     quantity of experience gathering I suspect.<br>
     <br>
     So what of it?  Care to engage in a discussion as to whether genes <br>
     will have soon served their usefulness and will give way to higher <br>
     forms of communicating essence and design to (for the next several <br>
     billion years) a blooming and fertile universe?<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
