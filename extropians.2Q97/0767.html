&lt;However, there is another way to suppress an invention: licence the <br>
patent, and then don't manufacture it.  This is entirely legal, though <br>
people don't tend to talk about it, as it is anti-social. Does anyone <br>
know of a time when this has definitely happened?&gt;<br>
<p>
Once corporations were illegitimately recognized as individuals (a form of<br>
group rights thoroughly destructive to individual rights), the primary<br>
usage and utility of patents changed radically.<br>
<p>
In "The Evolution of Technology" (1988) by George Basalla, it is explained:<br>
 "Once the corporation gained control of patents, the monopoly was used to<br>
suppress any inventions that might harm its own products or enhance those<br>
of a rival....  Researching new frontiers of technological knowledge might<br>
be far less productive than, in the words of a Bell president, occupying a<br>
technical field with 'a thousand and one little patents and inventions.' <br>
The prevention of competition was just one of the new uses Bell, and<br>
others, found for patents.  Patents also could be acquired to frustrate a<br>
competitor's attempt to secure a strong patent position through its own<br>
research efforts.  Finally, patents are often used to provide a strong<br>
bargaining chip that, at the right moment, can be traded to a rival for<br>
other patents or concessions.  Patents obtained for defensive purposes<br>
often remain undeveloped.  Instead of serving as a source of innovation,<br>
research becomes part of a business maneuver aimed at preserving the status<br>
quo, or at least assuring that novelties will emerge at a slowed rate."<br>
<p>
The international cartel of corporate commercialists maintains monopolistic<br>
patent practices; in the absence of this cartel, patents might not be<br>
useful at all considering the accelerating product cycle times we are<br>
experiencing.<br>
