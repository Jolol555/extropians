If you thought your finances were screwed up, and that you weren't<br>
getting much value from posting, then of course you did well to change<br>
your priorities.  But why must you assume we share your problems and<br>
values?  Maybe most of us are making reasonable tradeoffs between<br>
health, wealth, and enjoying life.  Part of enjoying life is<br>
participating in communities such as this one.<br>
