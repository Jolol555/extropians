I don't know about this commercial trick, but I am personally familiar<br>
with the Defense Department's practice of classifying patent<br>
applications. Every patent application that comes into the patent office<br>
is reviewed by a military liason. Anything with defense applicability,<br>
or even merely can be considered a threat to "national security" (i.e.<br>
anything that threatens the status quo), is classified, which means that<br>
while you cannot get a patent, the defense department gives your<br>
invention to a defense contractor via a laundering system that involves<br>
national labs like Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, Battelle, and<br>
Phillips. This process "cleanses" the invention so the contractor can<br>
legally make millions and billions of dollars off of your invention<br>
while it is classified. Only once your invention has been declassified<br>
can you receive a patent, and by then there are one or more defense<br>
contractors who have already patented more advanced versions of your<br>
invention, so you typically cannot get a patent by this time. Of course,<br>
they typically do not declassify it until it has no remaining commercial<br>
value.<br>
<p>
This happened to me with a device I invented that does some fun things<br>
with police radar. It also happened to a guy I know who is an<br>
oceanographer at UW. He invented an underwater microphone to listen to<br>
whale songs and underwater seismic activity. Turns out it is so<br>
sensitive that the Navy classfied it due to its potential for use in<br>
anti submarine warfare. Being rather miffed, and having the resources of<br>
the UW behind him, he brought the Navy to court. Evnetually they settled<br>
out of court. Now the Navy is the only licensee of his invention, in<br>
return for which, accredited scientists can have free access to Navy<br>
underwater listening stations at scheduled times, as well ass access to<br>
tape archives that have been "filtered" of sensitive content.<br>
