<p>
I'd suggest mentioning how excruciating the agony of heart attack is,<br>
and how much fun hobbling around as a post-stroke paralytic patient<br>
can be, and how much people usually enjoy chemotherapy and how<br>
successful it often is.<br>
<p>
I may have an advantage here -- living in New York, I have no trouble<br>
eating anywhere I please, including the fanciest restaurants. Most<br>
places other than steak houses will accomodate my eating preferences,<br>
and there are lots of purely vegan restaurants, too. I imagine things<br>
might be different in parts of Canada.<br>

<p>
No, you're missing just about nothing.<br>
<p>

<p>
B12 might -- *might* -- be difficult for vegans to get naturally. It<br>
is required in grotesquely small amounts -- micrograms per day -- and<br>
the body stores it. Take a vitamin supplement (preferably without<br>
iron) that has B12 in it and you are likely going to get more than<br>
you'll ever need.<br>
<p>
Beyond that, remember a couple of things: steer clear of sources of<br>
added fat like oils (no point in being a vegan for health reasons and<br>
frying every meal), and given all the research on sugar I'd try to<br>
steer clear of refined sugars when possible (I do, at least, although<br>
I'm not religious about it). Try to eat a balanced diet, and you<br>
should be fine.<br>

<i>&gt; B12 is probably the only thing you can't get from a vegan diet,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but you don't need much--it's likely you'll get enough just from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the things you don't check out carefully (the occasional baked</i><br>
<i>&gt; good with egg or gelatin or milk). </i><br>
<p>
True enough, but I supplement anyway.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; But, since there is actually no valid evidence that a vegan diet </i><br>
<i>&gt; is better than a more well-rounded low-fat diet, I think it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be negligent to recommend it to anyone except for religious</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons.</i><br>
<p>
There is a problem with this reasoning.<br>
<p>
A) Most of the best research on low fat diets and heart disease<br>
has involved low fat vegan diets. You are correct that no evidence<br>
exists that an equally low fat non-vegan diet would not be just as<br>
good, but then again, neither is there evidence that it would.<br>
<p>
B) It is far, far harder to maintain very low fat intake levels on<br>
anything but a fairly strict vegan diet. With a strict vegan diet,<br>
simply avoiding a couple of obvious things (i.e. frying everything or<br>
eating lots of avocados) keeps your fat intake levels insanely<br>
low. With a non-vegan diet, you have to take enormous amounts of care,<br>
estimate fat intake on everything you've eaten, etc. The effort is<br>
almost unsustainable. You can probably get below 20% of calories from<br>
fat by keeping close track on a non-vegan diet, but getting much lower<br>
than that requires almost superhuman dedication, and 20% is still<br>
probably far too high. Most vegans achieve substantially lower fat<br>
intake levels than that without any real effort at all. Being able to<br>
avoid thinking about what I'm eating is a real honest win.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am a lacto-veg myself, but I don't go out of my way to ask every</i><br>
<i>&gt; restaurant if they use a little lard in their beans or gelatin in</i><br>
<i>&gt; their desserts.  It just isn't worth the effort for unproven gains.</i><br>
<p>
As a "vegan for health reasons" I generally don't pay attention to<br>
issues like "is honey vegan" (I don't care about the bees and happily<br>
eat honey, although I usually avoid sweeteners to keep my glucose<br>
levels from surging anyway) and if someone slips me an egg in some<br>
baked good by accident I doubt it will kill me. However, I try my<br>
best, largely so that the occassionaly unexpected surprise actually<br>
will be noise in the food statistics rather than being "just one more<br>
egg won't kill me", if you know what I mean.<br>
<p>
Also, I don't do dairy products. Dairy is very high in fat -- a slab<br>
of cheese is much higher in fat than a similar calorie content slab of<br>
lean beef. I might as well be eating meat if I was going to eat cheese<br>
or milk. Besides, at this point, I've become lactose intolerant after enough<br>
years of not eating dairy. It appears most people do -- eating dairy<br>
products isn't something we evolved to do.<br>
<p>
So, I'll agree -- yes, in theory, a non-vegan diet can possibly be<br>
just as healthy, and yes, there isn't much point in being insanely<br>
anal retentive about veganism. On the other hand, its actually simpler<br>
being a vegan than trying to watch your diet closely and evaluating<br>
content with a calorie and fat percentage chart at every meal, and<br>
generally speaking, it has very few negatives in my quality of life.<br>
<p>
Also, I must say that although it made no obvious difference in my<br>
health when I was younger, as I've gotten older I've noticed that I'm<br>
not gaining weight the way my age peers are, and I seem to be<br>
healthier than them. We'll know for sure in another ten or twenty<br>
years, but I suspect that the experiment is already pretty<br>
successful.<br>
