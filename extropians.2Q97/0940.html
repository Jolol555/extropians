I wrote that there were plenty of Web sites and online catalogs <br>
devoted to nootropics.  One site I had in mind was Samu's Nootropics <br>
Resources at<br>
<a href="http://www.uta.fi/~samu/nootropics_resources.html">http://www.uta.fi/~samu/nootropics_resources.html</a><br>

&lt;Most of the information is quite unreliable. I suggest looking at the <br>
original papers&gt;<br>
<p>
Most of the information that I've seen on the Net is based on Ward <br>
Dean and John Morgenthaler's _Smart drugs &amp; nutrients : how to improve <br>
your memory and increase your intelligence using the latest <br>
discoveries in neuroscience_ ,1990 ISBN: 0-962-741892.  I don't know <br>
how reliable their book is nor how good the claim to representing "the <br>
latest discoveries" is given that it's seven years old.<br>
<p>
I think there was alot of interest in the early 90's that sort of <br>
faded away as people found that "good old-fashioned drugs" (as Hal F <br>
once aptly put it) were just as good and easier to get ahold of in <br>
many cases.<br>
<p>
Still, I'm not sure all the fragmented, original medical research <br>
papers would be very useful to the average person.  My approach was to <br>
get *just* a general, vague description of these substances, try them, <br>
and *only then* compare my experiences the annecdotes.  This was the <br>
closest I could come to a 'blinded' study.  The purpose of my post, <br>
yesterday, on nicotine was to illustrate just how extremely difficult <br>
and expensive it would be to document all the complex interactions <br>
related to these substances in a completely scientific and useful <br>
way.<br>
<p>
IOW, as long as the danger appears to be minimal, better to just do <br>
your own experiments rather than waste hundreds of hours combing the <br>
medical literature or waiting years and years for objective, <br>
non-commercial studies that may never be conducted.  As Perry pointed <br>
out:<br>
&lt;As for other sorts of drugs, well, most people are reluctant to talk <br>
about them, the political and legal situation being what it is.&gt;<br>

&lt;You don't want current implants, believe me (I'm studying implant <br>
technology for fun right now. BTW, as an exercise I will have to write <br>
an analysis/idea for a novel implant (ideally for medical use) based <br>
on today's capabilities: any ideas for an implant in need of <br>
development?).&gt;<br>
<p>
In my earlier response to litenite I gave an example of a current <br>
'cyborg' technology (Xybernaut's $5K Mobile Assistant <br>
speech-activated, head-mounted display for maintenance manuals).  I <br>
said "somewhat facetious"  because I'd really love to have such a <br>
device to access my own systems and the Web, anytime, anywhere.<br>
<p>
However, assuming the head-mount may eventually shrink to something <br>
like sunglasses, I think the big disadvantage of the current device is <br>
that it must be speech-activated.  I can picture a team of people in a <br>
meeting, or sitting at their individual work stations, all apparently <br>
babbling to themselves.  Social animals that we are, this may be <br>
unacceptable.<br>
<p>
SO, the next step, and my idea for one of the first practical <br>
semi-implant devices, would be subvocalizing speech-activation device. <br>
 On second thought, this could probably just be some sort of necklace. <br>
 I was thinking that this would be something implanted in the throat <br>
with some sort of lead coming out through the skin to connect to an <br>
external electronic device.  Still, some type of simple implant such <br>
as this with an external connection that avoids infectious and <br>
immunolgical problems would be an nice advance (unless something <br>
similar has already been done?)<br>
