<p>
<p>
In an earlier post I said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; My point is that I have heard that PICS can be &lt;used&gt; to </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; censor OTHER people. . . .</i><br>
<p>
Then Lee Daniel Cricker said:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Then you heard wrong.  PICS cannot /itself/ censor anything; a PICS</i><br>
<i>&gt;bureau is a source of information, nothing more.  It is the /users/</i><br>
<i>&gt;of that information who can use it to censor if they desire, but one</i><br>
<i>&gt;cannot blame a technology for its misuse.  To paraphrase the NRA on</i><br>
<i>&gt;that subject: PICS doesn't censor people, people censor people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

   It's ironic Lee that you and I have so much in common that you can't <br>
see past your passionate opinions of things to see what I'm really <br>
asking.  First of all, I never once said PICS &lt;itself&gt; can or cannot be <br>
used to censor anything.  In fact since I know very little about PICS, I <br>
haven't stated anything affirmative about PICS at all.  Perhaps my <br>
questions were not worded precisely enough to fit your semantic <br>
prejudices. Thus, your responses to my QUESTIONS have been off base. <br>
This seems to me that your more interested in showing off your opinions, <br>
rather than to constructively answer my specific questions.  If this is <br>
not the case, then I will try for round 3.  I hope this time my <br>
questions are worded in such a way as to not upset your sensabilities.<br>
<p>
   Is there a way for PEOPLE to get around other PEOPLE &lt;using&gt; filters <br>
to censor them without their consent?  For example, is there a way for a <br>
clever enough Chineese citizen to gain access to those parts of the Net <br>
the Chinnees Government has blocked? Can a high-level filtering system <br>
be hacked?  And if so, how?<br>
<p>
If anybody else out there has answers to these questions please feel <br>
free to reply.<br>
