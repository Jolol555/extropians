<i>&gt; Yes its complex, but the time to bring expectations and actions into</i><br>
<i>&gt; equilibrium depends on the mechanisms of information transmission.  If</i><br>
<i>&gt; each person just makes a private guess, and then waits a generation to</i><br>
<i>&gt; see the results, it could take a while.  It should help to have more</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a conversation about what we want and expect.  So I am dissapointed</i><br>
<i>&gt; that there seems to be little conversation on these topics.  </i><br>
<p>
Frankly, I find the nature of the questions as posed disturbingly<br>
collectivist.  How "we" should teach "children" about "roles in<br>
society" is an irrational concept from the start.  What I will<br>
teach my son or daughter is how to best exploit his or her own<br>
natural talents and predispositions, whatever they might be, and<br>
how to deal with others openly, honestly, and fairly to achieve<br>
whatever his ends might be.<br>
<p>
Certainly many assumptions will be made in relationships.  Any<br>
contract, such as marriage, rarely spells out every detail of who<br>
performs every action; typically each will settle into assumed roles,<br>
or make choices based on ability or predisposition, as you say.  But<br>
to correct the problems that come from bad assumptons doesn't require<br>
changing to new--and potentially just as bad--assumptions; it<br>
requires learning how to communicate openly and deal fairly in light<br>
of /whatever/ issues come up that weren't covered in the original<br>
contract, and the commitment that /all/ human relationships are<br>
founded on mutual consent, not shared assumptions.<br>
<p>
I am certainly not among the PC-brainwashed masses who are afraid<br>
to state the obvious that men and women are different, and I will<br>
even go so far as to say that those who postulate equal abilities<br>
and drives for the sexes have no rational basis to do so in light<br>
of the evidence of evolution.  But that doesn't mean I really want<br>
to know every detail of the differences, nor do I think it is<br>
necessary to know them to deal fairly.  I deal fairly with women<br>
because I deal fairly with people, not because I understand them<br>
or empathize with them or other such psychobabble.<br>
