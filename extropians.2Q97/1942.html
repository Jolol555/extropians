<i>        &gt;I wonder if the founding fathers in declaring the right of free</i><br>
<i>        &gt;speech imagined multi-national companies with huge advertising</i><br>
<i>        &gt;budgets</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Who cares, I don't usually listen to moral advice from slave owners.<br>
             <br>
     <br>
<i>        &gt;Free speech is not an oan all or nothing consideration in my book.It</i><br>
<i>        &gt;is leveraged by discernment and the discernment of the collective at</i><br>
<i>        &gt;that. And even then, if the decisions of the people are a result of</i><br>
<i>        &gt;a smoke and mirrors deception by a charismatic leader (say...Hitler</i><br>
<i>        &gt;or Kohmeni), is it true discernment?  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
I would be all in favor of government thought control to protect the world<br>
from dangerous or erroneous ideas, provided you can prove to me that this new<br>
ministry of truth would have the following 4 properties:<br>
  <br>
1) A ministry of truth that can always tell truth from falsehood.<br>
 <br>
2) A ministry of truth that can always tell when little people like me and <br>
   you can not handle the truth and so must be lied to.<br>
<p>
3) A ministry of truth staffed exclusively by saints so it always has the <br>
   moral courage to do the right thing and would never abuse its awesome <br>
   power.<br>
<p>
4) A ministry of truth that can magically enforce its edicts on incorrect<br>
   speech even in a world that contains strong encryption, anonymous <br>
   re-mailers, DC nets and a Internet that spans the globe.<br>
<p>
     <br>
<i>        &gt;with alcohol consumption linked to so much dysfunction, death and </i><br>
<i>        &gt;destruction, I don't really associate "free speech" with a </i><br>
<i>        &gt;multi-billion dollar industry's ability to exercise it sensibly, </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
I concede that stupidity can be hazardous to your health, and perhaps it's a<br>
character flaw on my part but I just don't have a burning desire to make the<br>
world safe for fools, especially when it would mean less freedom for me.<br>
I think of it as Evolution in action.<br>
            <br>
     <br>
<i>        &gt;In most things in a cooperative democracy, there are limits</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That's one reason most of us on this list do not believe in democracy, I<br>
certainly don't.<br>
                                                                     <br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;and not just yelling "Fire" falsely in crowded theater.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That cliche originally came from the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes<br>
(1841-1935), he used it in one of his decisions that upheld the conviction of<br>
a man imprisoned for saying America should not be in the First World War.<br>
Years later Holmes said it was the worst decision he made in his entire legal<br>
career and he cringed whenever he heard somebody quoting his famous saying.<br>
