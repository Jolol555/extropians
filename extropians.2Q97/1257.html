<i>&gt;Yes.  A while back, I started a thread "Extropians Investing in the Future."</i><br>
<i>&gt;The responses were quite informed.  Over the months, I have been meeting</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a couple of friends to discuss stock and investments portfolios.  Since</i><br>
<i>&gt;this time, I have begun taking charge of my own investments.  By using the</i><br>

<p>
<p>
I would recommend trading via the web.  Not only is it the cheapest way to<br>
trade (per share), but brokers are often poor sources of information.<br>
Commissions vary not only with the amount of stock they sell, but which<br>
stock they sell.  As my mother ( a stock broker and regional manager for a<br>
large brokerage house ) often reminded me, half the brokers she ever worked<br>
with would routinely lie to their clients to make extra money.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;One aspect of taking charge of one's investments is to learn from another's</i><br>
<i>&gt;mistakes.  I would gladly share some of my blunders as well as success and</i><br>
<i>&gt;insights with  investments, especially real estate.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I would be very interested in hearing about your real estate investments.<br>
I am not an expert on real estate investing but am very interested in it.<br>
