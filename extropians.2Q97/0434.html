Sulloway's _Born to Rebel_ has tons of number crunching behind it, and<br>
is about applying Darwinian family mechanics to personality development.<br>
It doesn't do much for predicting history per se, but claims to tell you<br>
something about the people in it.  Sulloway also applied for a grant to<br>
do some statistical study, I forget about what, and the NSF historians<br>
basically laughed him out because of his idea of applying numbers to<br>
history.  At least that's how he tells it.<br>
<p>
Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ isn't so obviously numerical, but<br>
it's certainly an attempt at figuring out broad laws from empirical<br>
data.<br>
