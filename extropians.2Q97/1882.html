ASTEROID DISCOVERED TO HAVE ORBIT LOCKED TO EARTH'S<br>
This week came the interesting news of a 5 km asteroid whose<br>
orbit is dynamically locked into the orbit of the Earth, making<br>
it, aside from the Moon, Earth's only known natural companion.<br>
An explanation of the quite special orbital geometry is difficult<br>
without diagrams, but one can attempt it. The story is that<br>
more than two hundred years ago, the French mathematician<br>
Lagrange investigated the dynamics of the gravitational three-<br>
body problem, and discovered that if there are two bodies, A and<br>
B, and the mass of B is less than 0.04 the mass of A, then as B<br>
orbits around A, there are two equilibrium points in B's orbit,<br>
one leading B and one trailing B, and that at these equilibrium<br>
points a third smaller body (or bodies) can enter the two-body<br>
system and there can be sustained a dynamic equilibrated<br>
arrangement. Such arrangements have in fact been observed for<br>
asteroids associated with the Jupiter and Mars orbits. This new<br>
asteroid, called asteroid 3753, is associated with Earth's orbit,<br>
but in a quite special way: the orbit of 3753 encompasses both<br>
equilibrium points and is a "horseshoe" orbit, and it is only<br>
because the asteroid's orbit is highly inclined with respect to<br>
the plane of the Earth's orbit that a collision is unlikely. The<br>
analysis and numerical solutions of the relevant dynamical<br>
equations were presented by Paul A. Wiegert et al (York<br>
University, CA; University of Turku, FI). (Nature 12 June)<br>

NEW LASER STUDIES OF ULTRAFAST REACTION DYNAMICS<br>
Most chemical reactions involving two or more reactants occur in<br>
the presence of a solvent, a significant presence, since the<br>
solvent molecules are always interacting with the reactants<br>
themselves in some important manner. To fully understand what<br>
occurs between the main reactants, one must understand the<br>
participation of the solvent in the reaction sequence. The<br>
problem has been that these solvent-reactant events are of<br>
extremely short duration, on the order of femtoseconds<br>
[10exp(-15) sec], and it is only recently, with the availability<br>
of laser pulse techniques, that physical chemists can observe<br>
chemical bonds break and reform in real time. B. Jefferys<br>
Greenblatt et al (University of California Berkeley, US) have now<br>
described the use of such techniques to examine the influence of<br>
a solvent on the photodissociation of a molecular cluster ion<br>
(Iodine-Argon). Apparently, in a single experiment, they have<br>
presented "a comprehensive picture of the recombination,<br>
relaxation, and evaporation processes that follow photodissocia-<br>
tion of a diatomic molecular ion in a cluster." (Science 13 June)<br>

TWENTY-TWO DAY OBSERVATION OF A SINGLE MOLECULE ENERGY SWITCH<br>
Single-molecule optical information storage would make possible<br>
information storage densities enormously greater than any that<br>
can now be achieved. This is one reason why physicists and<br>
physical chemists have recently been much interested in single-<br>
molecule doped systems in which the single molecule is forced to<br>
switch energy states. The problem has been that so far no one has<br>
found a way to produce accurately controlled switching. Now F.<br>
Kulzer et al (University of Munich DE) have reported accurately<br>
controlled switching of energy states of a single molecule of<br>
terrylene resident in a p-terphenyl crystal, and show switching<br>
of "single-molecule absorption lines in a controlled way between<br>
well-defined frequency positions." The experiments involved<br>
flipping the same single molecule switch for 22 days. Single-<br>
molecule optical information storage devices are not yet a<br>
reality, but this is certainly a significant step forward.<br>

NEW OBSERVATIONS OF CHEMICAL EVOLUTION OF ENZYMES<br>
There is a consensus that chemical systems in biological<br>
organisms came into being through evolutionary processes. Some<br>
hold that natural selection is the only evolutionary mechanism<br>
involved, while others consider the possibility of additional<br>
mechanisms. In any case, the extant chemical systems evolved, and<br>
the question of how they evolved is important for our<br>
understanding of many vital chemical systems such as the immune<br>
system in humans. Enzymes, for example, are proteins that are<br>
capable of exquisite selectivity and enormous catalytic power,<br>
and we would like to know how any particular set of enzymes in an<br>
organism came to exist. Gary J. Wedemayer et al (University of<br>
California Berkeley US, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,<br>
Berkeley US) this week presented the results of x-ray<br>
crystallographic studies of a particular antibody enzyme (Fab<br>
germline fragment, which matures into 48G7), and correlated the<br>
data with the antibody's biophysical, kinetic, and structural<br>
properties. They suggest that a limited number of protein<br>
frameworks, each capable of evolving multiple configurations, is<br>
the origin of the extraordinary diversity present in the<br>
antibody-catalyst domain. They further suggest that their studies<br>
provide important insights into the molecular basis of the immune<br>
response, and may also be of significance for the understanding<br>
of other biochemical systems and functions. (Science 13 June)<br>

EVIDENCE FOR CROSS-KINGDOM TRANSPOSABLE DNA ELEMENTS<br>
A transposon is a limited DNA sequence that under the proper<br>
dynamic conditions can effectively translocate from one DNA<br>
system to another, either in the same cell, or between cells, or<br>
between cells of different organisms of the same or different<br>
species, and remain functional. Until now, transposons were<br>
thought to be loosely limited to same or neighboring species<br>
translocations. But this week Frederico J. Gueiros-Filho and<br>
Steven M. Beverley (Harvard Medical School, Boston US) have<br>
demonstrated that a transposon of what is known as the "mariner"<br>
family can be experimentally translocated cross-kingdom, in this<br>
case from the insect Drosophila mauritiana (a mosquito) to the<br>
protozoan Leishmania major (the pathogen responsible for<br>
malaria). This development has caused excitement among micro-<br>
biologists because it makes possible new genetic techniques<br>
not only in the study of the malaria parasite, but also in<br>
studies of other parasitic pathogens. The authors point out that<br>
the reported mariner translocation involves the crossing of an<br>
evolutionary divide of one billion years. (Science 13 June)<br>

SUGGESTION OF EVOLUTIONARY DUPLICATION OF YEAST GENOME<br>
After a systematic computerized search of a particular entire<br>
yeast genome, Kenneth H. Wolfe and Denis C. Shields (University<br>
of Dublin, IE) report that statistical analysis of duplicate<br>
segments suggests the entire genome underwent duplication<br>
approximately 100 million years ago. Duplication of single genes<br>
is considered a significant source of biological novelty, but<br>
this is the first evidence of the possibility of the duplication<br>
of an entire genome. The authors suggest that duplication to<br>
tetraploidy may have led to the ability of this species, S.<br>
cerevisiae, to anaerobically ferment sugar and produce ethanol.<br>
(Nature 12 June)<br>
<p>
NEW DATA SUGGESTS IMPORTANCE OF MUTATION RATE VARIABILITY<br>
There is a growing consensus that at least in bacteria mutation<br>
rates within a species can be highly variable, and that this<br>
variability is itself subjected to Darwinian selection. Two<br>
related reports appeared this week, one involving mathematical<br>
modeling [F. Taddei et al (University of Paris, FR; University of<br>
Sussex, UK], and the other experimental observations of<br>
populations of the bacterium E. coli [P. D. Sniegowski et al<br>
(University of Pennsylvania, US; Michigan State University US)].<br>
Both groups provide support for the idea that high mutation rates<br>
may play an important role in adaptive evolution. In an essay<br>
reviewing this work, E. Richard Moxon (University of Oxford, UK)<br>
and David S. Thaler (Rockefeller University, US) claim a broader<br>
implication, and state, "The generation of variation is itself<br>
under genetic control, allowing a reflectivity -- an informat-<br>
ional feedback -- on the mechanisms by which diversity is<br>
generated in biological evolution." (Nature 12 June)<br>

AN UNUSUAL OUTBREAK OF DEADLY HANTAVIRUS DISEASE<br>
Hantavirus is a serious pulmonary infectious disease with a high<br>
mortality rate (approximately 50%). It is caused by a family of<br>
viruses (Hantavirus or Hantaan virus) named after the Hantaan<br>
River in Korea, where the first strain was discovered in the<br>
1950s. For the past 40 years it has been thought that the virus<br>
spreads only via the inhalation of microscopic bits of contamin-<br>
ated rodent urine or feces. Now after an investigation into a<br>
hantavirus outbreak in Argentina last year, it has been concluded<br>
that the first known instance of person-to-person transmission of<br>
the hantavirus has occurred. The epidemiology of this pathogen<br>
will need to be revised. (New York Times 17 June)<br>
