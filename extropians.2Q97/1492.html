What is your problem with other people talking on their cellular phones?<br>
Are you bothered because you are so self involved that you think that<br>
the rest of the world should spend its time watching you as you go by?<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  I can let the machine read my mail, and dictate responses.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; There is lots of small, irritating waits which can be utilized much better.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Making</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; tree killing obsolete is impossible without a good head-up, and a head</i><br>
<i>&gt; tracker, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; both are impossible without a wearable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Why, exactly, do you need a head-up and a head tracker to replace paper ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  When was the last time you walk around with paper stuck to your face ?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  (don't answer).  Here's a good replacement for paper, paper!  Smart paper,</i><br>
<i>&gt; made from thin, flexible displays or smart ink.  You can pick it up, write on</i><br>
<i>&gt; it, save the document and leave it for the next person.</i><br>
<p>
What the hell are you talking about here. Just giving a high tech<br>
electronic or nano device a fancy name like "smart paper" does not make<br>
it paper. Besides, paper is opaque, so you cannot read it and walk at<br>
the same time. With a heads up, you can do both.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; People yearn for wearables. They just don't know it yet.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think people know exactly what they want - something that works, something</i><br>
<i>&gt; that makes life easier.  I think one of the reasons why they aren't getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they want is the acceptance that computers are complex, difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt; machines.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
If that is so, why haven't we had fax machines since the instant the<br>
phone was invented, or at least since radio or tv was invented? If<br>
people knew they needed fax machines, then they should have been hard at<br>
work on them decades before they were available.<br>
<p>
What it takes is one person or company with the money available that is<br>
willing to bite it for a while and really pump the PR machine up until<br>
enough people see the need for it that they create a critical mass<br>
market. In today's risk averse environment, it takes people with vision<br>
that is still only present in a precious few.<br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Now this is a challenge for marketing.</i><br>
