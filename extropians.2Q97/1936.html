<i>&gt;That's useful feedback, thanks. Do other folks agree? The spiral logo is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;neat way of saying "here is extropian stuff" but if it really does give the</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrong impression we might need to scale back on its use. Is it just the</i><br>
<i>&gt;spiral logo, or do other aspects of the site give a misleading impression.</i><br>
<p>
Unfortunately, many new ageish cults have adopted the symbols and <br>
artistic style that used to be within the domain of those who <br>
considered themselves pragmatic futurists.  Reading up on Heaven's <br>
Gate really opened my eyes to the appropriation of verbiage and <br>
symbology to create a veneer of scientific appropriateness.  <br>
<p>
Whether organizations like Extropy should accomodate this and change their <br>
own style is another question.  Any symbol might be interpreted in a <br>
cabalistic manner;  why should we limit our artistic expressions?  I <br>
would rather that effort be put towards correcting these (previously <br>
discussed) citations of Extropy Institute as a cult and getting hard <br>
information out about transhumanist thought in general.  <br>
