The Internet and its users treat attempted censorship as damage, and <br>
promptly route around it.<br>

This post will interest intelligent subscribers to HAYEK-L.<br>

<p>
Coping with volunes of mail with threadings is a bit of a bind, eh?<br>
<p>
Here are some simple ways to save on connect time, on disk space, on <br>
unnecessary effort, and on 'information overload'   &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
First, access this Universal Resource Locator: (URL):<br>
<p>

             <a href="http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/archives/hayek-l">http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/archives/hayek-l</a><br>

      <br>
using your World Wide Web Browser:<br>
<p>
<p>
Look around first, and see how easy it all is!<br>
<p>
If you reckon you can handle it (and if you've managed to get thus far <br>
on HAYEK-L, you certainly can!):<br>
<p>
then save the URL to your 'Hotlist.'<br>
<p>
<p>
If you're a penniles student or scholar, and have a low-spec PC, and you <br>
have no Web browser, and you have some software configuration skills, <br>
there are other browsers than all the cumbersome, unreliable Windoze <br>
nonsense!<br>
<p>
One of them is at:<br>

<p>

<p>
It's a fairly unsophisticated browser, but it will run on an Intel 8086 <br>
(and upwards) system with 540k of RAM and floppy disks!. <br>

<p>
Here's an interesting and relevant problem-situation for HAYEK-L <br>
subscribers to discuss; it raises profound issues of fundamental <br>
importance to Hayek's programme of spontaneous orders, probably the most <br>
valuable part of his oeuvre.<br>
<p>
If you think this next part a digression, you're wrong!  Serious Hayek <br>
scholars will spot this instantly!<br>
<p>
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------<br>
<p>
The Microsoft Empire was founded on a deliberately crippled platform <br>
(the IBM-PC, which was designed not to impact on IBM's mini- and <br>
mainframe sales)).<br>
<p>
Microsoft took over a crippled Operating System which had been clumsily <br>
ripped off from CP/M by people with nothing like the skills of Gary <br>
Kildall and his team at Digital Research.<br>
<p>
IBM couldn't do a deal with Digital Reasearch, for reasons which bear <br>
looking into, and because Kildall didn't want to downgrade his fine <br>
product, which was the foundation of Personal Computing.<br>
<p>
So here we are, with Wintel foisting an absurd and costly system which <br>
locks up and falls over from time to time, on the entire world.  There are <br>
few misguided but influential people in parts of the US Government who <br>
cooperate with Microsoft, because (according to James Adams, writing in <br>
the Sunday Times), there are 'back doors' and latent viruses embedded in <br>
the software.<br>
<p>
These can be remotely activated while you're online, and data packets <br>
inserted into the data stream to activate subroutines which scan your hard <br>
disk, and send the whole directories strucure to somewhere else by means <br>
of interleave data packets with _different address destination headers_.<br>
<p>
On your next logon, they can pick selected files straight off your hard <br>
drive.  Think about it: they may have done this already, if you're <br>
'interesting' enough.<br>
<p>
<p>
Any half-way competent foreign signals intelligent outfit knowing how to <br>
do this (a totalitarian dictatership elsewhere in the world, ferinstance) <br>
can ransack the hard drives of any American who browses the Web via <br>
Windows95.<br>
<p>
This, according to intelligence expert James  Adams (writing recently in <br>
the 'Sunday Times').  Many other people are discussing it, too. The Windoze <br>
'bloatware' makes them a bit difficult to spot, but they're there all <br>
right.<br>
<p>
<p>
This cannot possibly be in accordannce with the very explicit Mission <br>
Statement of the National Security Agency, which is charged with <br>
protecting the interests of _all_ American citizens, not just Bill Gates.<br>
<p>
All NSA staffers are sworn to uphold the American Constitution, and all <br>
the rights it guarantees to all Americans.<br>

There are much better, cheaper alternatives to Wndoze around right now, <br>
and even better combined Web TV (and SVGA) home PCs with built-in <br>
'softmodem' and voice command and text input at 100+ wpm. impending.<br>
<p>
Much beter than the (appropriately-naemd) slave terminals -- Network <br>
Computers, with no real local computational power.<br>
<p>
<p>
'Blackbird' MacroComputers (Copyright).<br>
<p>
And other goodies too.<br>
<p>
They will be so cheap that an ISP or telco will _give_ you a basic <br>
Blackbird.  They're based on the Motorola micocessor range, and Bill Gates <br>
(or any half-witted deputy) won't know what hit him if they try to screw <br>
Motorola around.  They're a fully-fledged major defense contractor, with a <br>
global data-radio going up soon -- 'Iridium.'<br>
<p>
Better yet, the 'Blackbird' DSP technology means you can _download_ the <br>
latest SofmMdem software -- including spread-spectrum datastreams wich <br>
are far faster and more error-resistant than what most of you use at the <br>
moment. The telcos will be more than willing to let you 'blink' on and off <br>
the Web during your seesions -- it reduces the load on their systems.<br>
<p>
The present value of a new ISP client to an ISP provider in America is <br>
around $1200.  They can afford to _give_ customers a basic Blackbird, <br>
which wil 'retail' at arounf $500.  Not much Bill Gates can do about that, <br>
unless he wants to start killing everyone... &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
Don't complain about 'advertizing': -- to the customers, Blackbirds can be <br>
_free_.  Some people will complain about anything, of course.<br>
<p>
The more _UNaffordable_ these  lightning-fast personal computers were, the <br>
more we would see a 'verticalist' hierarchical society of priviledge, <br>
where only the better-off can participate in the Information Revolution <br>
and the 'Warp-Speed' transformation of the world's econmy.  Oh, and the <br>
world's societies, too.<br>
<p>
Spontaneous Orders are horizontalist and equalitarian.<br>
<p>
The choice has to be obvious to any genuine Hayekian who is not using <br>
Hayek's ideas as ' ... a cover for unconfessable intersts ... ' in scholar <br>
Robert G. Wesson's apt turn of phrase.<br>

Thusly, you get no mail at all from HAYEK-L, but you can read all the <br>
postings, instantly and automatically indexed into the onsite Hypertext <br>
Archives at St. Johns.  Of course, Hayek-L could be anywhere in the world <br>
right now, given the nature of 'CyberSpace' and the Domain Net Address <br>
servers. Ditto ourselves!  &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
All the URLs are automatically highlighted in the Archives, and are <br>
fully 'clickable'.  Useful for scholars and writers and publishers who <br>
want to provide embedded HotLinks to various papers and sites.<br>
<p>
And you can still post direct to HAYEK-L, at your pleasure.<br>
