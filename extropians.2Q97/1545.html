<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A tunable plasma engine designed by MIT is being tested by NASA.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It can reduce the one way trip to Mars to 2.5 months and</i><br>
<i>&gt;allow a round trip of 7 months duration.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It uses microwaves to heat hydrogen to 10 million degrees which</i><br>
<i>&gt;sends ions out at speeds of 50-300km/sec. (The nando article says</i><br>
<i>&gt;per hour but that must be incorrect). Power source would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;a nuclear reactor. They expect to flight test in 5 years.</i><br>

HOUSTON, Texas (May 20, 1997 10:55 a.m. EDT) - A revolutionary rocket engine<br>
using ions as fuel will cut the duration of a round-trip, manned mission to<br>
Mars from more than three years to a mere seven months, scientists said.<br>
<p>
The Tunable Exhaust Plasma Rocket is undergoing its first tests at the<br>
Johnson Space Center near Houston. A flight test will come in five years<br>
aboard a space shuttle.<br>
<p>
With the ion engine, astronauts will take two-and-a-half months to reach<br>
Mars, where they will remain for two months before completing their<br>
round-trip space voyage in seven months.<br>
<p>
With current rocket technology, Mars would be an eight-month space trip each<br>
way, forcing astronauts to wait two years on the red planet for a favorable<br>
alignment for the return to Earth.<br>
<p>
Astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz, who is researching the ion engine for the<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the technology forces plasma --<br>
ionized gas heated to 10 million degrees -- through a tube topped by a<br>
nozzle. Heating hydrogen to such high temperatures separates the atom from<br>
its electron, creating an ion shot out at a speed of 50 to 300 kilometers<br>
per hour.<br>
<p>
Magnetic fields inside the main body of the rocket and at its openings<br>
channel the plasma and "control the speed of ejection, just as you do for a<br>
water hose," Chang-Diaz said.<br>
<p>
Despite its modest size, three to four yards in length by one yard in<br>
diameter, the ion engine will be able to propel a spaceship all the way to=<br>
 Mars.<br>
<p>
To heat up the gas, a microwave oven of sorts is used, powered by 10<br>
megawatts of power supplied by a nuclear reactor.<br>
<p>
The spaceship will be surrounded by several huge tanks filled with liquid<br>
hydrogen, similar to those used by the shuttle at launch. The tanks will<br>
shield the crew from dangerous solar emissions and, at the same time,<br>
provide good insulation against heat.<br>
<p>
In a trip to Mars, Chang-Diaz said, the ion engine would accelerate the<br>
spaceship for half the distance and then decelerate it until it can settle<br>
into an orbit around the red planet prior to a landing.<br>
<p>
For now, Chang-Diaz is happy firing up his new engines every day inside a<br>
special room at Houston's Sony Carter Training Center, where US astronauts<br>
undergo their training.<br>
<p>
If all goes well, he said, in five years a smaller version of the ion engine<br>
will be dropped out of an orbiting space shuttle and fired up to see how it<br>
cruises along.<br>
<p>
Electricity during the tests will be supplied by a series of batteries.<br>
Chang-Diaz believes that once proven in a Mars mission, the ion engine will<br>
propel man further out, to Jupiter, Saturn or even Pluto.<br>
