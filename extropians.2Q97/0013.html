Robin Hanson:<br>

<i>&gt; Even if a single firm loses</i><br>
<i>&gt; 30-50% of their value in such a move, groups of firms could lose much</i><br>
<i>&gt; more if they failed to coordinate to all move to the same place in</i><br>
<i>&gt; such a way as to preserve their business relations (based in part </i><br>
<i>&gt; on geographic proximity).</i><br>
<p>
This is a good, important point, and it is probably the main part of the<br>
secular trend that is bringing about the end of the nation-state.   In most<br>
industries geographic proximity is  becoming less important, slowly but<br>
substantially over the long term.  <br>
<p>
For  example, steel mills can now  operate on scrap and electricity, <br>
they no longer need to be located near coal sources and alongside <br>
railroads to raw ore mines.   <br>
<p>
Telecommuting is growing far  more slowly than enthusiasts would like, <br>
but  it is nevertheless a substantial long-term secular trend that will likely <br>
account for two-thirds of earned income (that it does not involve the majority<br>
of workers is irrelevant)  by the middle of the next century.   A "phase transition" <br>
in telecommuting  comes when the benefits of worldwide teams based on <br>
specialty instead of  proximity come to outweigh the remaining lower-touch <br>
nature of team interaction.   The "touchiness"  available from teleconferencing  <br>
is increased, and  more social/institutional workarounds to lack of touchiness <br>
are discovered, and these trends meet  the growing realization of the value <br>
of worldwide-deployable teams.<br>
<p>
Commuting by airplane, worldwide, is also substantial long-term secular growth<br>
trend – it is a commonplace for a growing band of executives, salesmen, <br>
and technological hyperspecialists.  By 2050 most <br>
of the world’s high earners will consider the planet their workplace, not<br>
a particular geographical subset of it.    As this occurs, geographical <br>
proximity becomes more particulate  (e.g., being next to an airport, any<br>
airport, leads to more high-touch interaction than being in the same province) <br>
and less important (the telecommuting phase change).   Geographical <br>
boundaries, quite useful for extorting from peasants tied to land or industrial<br>
plants tied to railheads, become ludicrous for extorting from global information<br>
workers.<br>
<p>
The the same conferencing and commuting technologies, communities are<br>
slowly becoming worldwide communities of  interest, with geographical <br>
communities slowly diminishing into quaint backwaters.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Also, individuals would lose houses and</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal possessions, communities would lose roads, shopping centers,</i><br>
Ø etc. <br>
<p>
The threat of major media exposure, combined with lack of substantial<br>
benefit from undertaking the effort to capture this mass (which will be dead<br>
mass, having  been stripped of its information capital value), will be<br>
a sufficient deterant in nearly all cases.<br>
<p>
<p>
Onwards,<br>
Zylof<br>
