A thread with the above subject, Mar 22 -31, helped me think as I worked<br>
on a paper on the same topic, a draft of which is now available at:<br>
<p>
   <a href="http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/calibration.ps">http://hss.caltech.edu/~hanson/calibration.ps</a><br>
<p>
I had mentioned theoretical results which indicated that Bayesians<br>
can't have persistent disagreements.  In my research I focused on the<br>
critique that such models require far too much computational abilities<br>
of their agents, and generalized the result to highly computationally<br>
constrained agents.  Here is a title and abstract:<br>
<p>
      "Disagreements are about Computation, Not Information".<br>
       <br>
  Consider two agents who want to be Bayesians with a common prior, but<br>
  who can not due to computational limitations.  If these agents agree<br>
  that they can reason abstractly about the fact that they have these<br>
  limitations, then they can only agree to disagree about their estimate<br>
  of a random variable if they agree to disagree (to a similar degree)<br>
  about both their average biases.  Yet average bias can in principle be<br>
  computed independently of any agent's private information.  Thus<br>
  disagreements must be fundamentally about computation, rather than<br>
  about the actual state of the world.<br>
<p>
Be warned: the paper has a lot of math.<br>
