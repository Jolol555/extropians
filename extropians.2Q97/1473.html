Actually, I believe that the reason the crime rate appears to have gone<br>
down (at least as far as crimes of violence are concerned) is because<br>
many of the violations of law that have been occuring are technically<br>
not yet classified as crimes.<br>
What the FBI does not include as crimes are many of the offenses<br>
normally classified as fraud. Most of these fraudulent acts a handled as<br>
civil offences and therefore not included in USDOJ statistics.<br>
If an analysis were made of civil fraud complaints usually considered to<br>
be consumer fraud complaints that have been filed with the FTC, the SEC,<br>
the Postal Inspector, the 50 state Attorneys General, other Consumer<br>
Protection Agencies and the small claims courts around the country, I<br>
think you would find that the number of incidents of financial loss as<br>
well as the amount of money lost through fraud have increased<br>
substantially. <br>
Since these incidents tend to involve emotional rather than physical<br>
pain they tend to be de-emphasized by the media. And, since many of the<br>
frauds are committed by allegedly "reputable" members of society with<br>
the ability to obtain political and legal support for their actions, it<br>
is currently unlikely that any substantive action to prevent most<br>
incidents of fraud will be taken by law enforcement officials. The<br>
unfortunate reality of the situation is that most prosecutions of fraud<br>
are to complex for criminal prosecuters to handle and lack media "sex<br>
appeal".<br>
