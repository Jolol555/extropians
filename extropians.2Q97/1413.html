<i>&gt;The problem is getting work. How many jobs are there that you can do</i><br>
<i>&gt;from a laptop anywhere?</i><br>
<p>
It's not a technological problem. You can get &gt;200 MHz laptops with<br>
enough memory to do almost anything you would with a desktop<br>
computer. Internet is usually not a problem, 56K modem or perhaps<br>
ISDN will get you far enough. As a mobile knowledge worker, you<br>
don't need any reference books, most of the information is on the<br>
Internet or on CD-roms.<br>
<p>
Mobile working is also getting less and less a social problem, as<br>
communication is getting better and better. Teamwork will always<br>
require a fair amount of communication between the players, but<br>
physical distance is no longer an obstable for that. You still have<br>
to meet people face to face, but being mobile will be an advantage,<br>
not a disadvantage.<br>
<p>
I can't think of any jobs that I would like to do that I couldn't do<br>
anywhere. (I admit working on the factory floor for some big<br>
software company is not on my list.) To me, the only difference<br>
and the only reason to go mobile is to become truly Transnational<br>
and Transcultural.<br>
