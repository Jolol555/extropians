You're falling into the statist misconception that becasue there is no<br>
government, there will be no rules.  Property owners can still set their own<br>
rules, and as long as current popular opinion about public nudity prevails<br>
(many are offended and only a few want it) it's a good bet that most public<br>
spaces - malls, park, roads, and offices - will continue to bar nudity.  No<br>
doubt you will see clothing-optional spaces, which you can't find now, but<br>
they will be in the minority.<br>
