<i>&gt; I hope Mark's comments will make it little clearer to Mr. Celine</i><br>

<p>
Yes they do. <br>
<p>
I happen to think that in a short time, what we know of as "privacy"<br>
will be a thing of the past. Some others are not convinced of that. <br>
<p>
The technologies that we are pushing on this list are just as easily<br>
used against us as they are by us and for us. Since these technologies<br>
*will* someday exist, I feel also that the last remnants of what we call<br>
privacy will dissipate into a vestigial anachronism. I have resigned<br>
myself to this, and that attitude has infiltrated my post. <br>
<p>
If you don't believe it will happen, then take issue with me. If you<br>
don't like my attitude of resignation, tell me why. But spare me the<br>
vitriol. I'm on this list to learn. If you know it all, then teach me.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Mr. Celine's namesake, a fictional character in a famous novel,</i><br>
<i>&gt; once observed "Without private property, there can be no private</i><br>
<i>&gt; life." Mr. Celine might also want to keep in mind that without</i><br>
<i>&gt; privacy, there can be no private property.</i><br>
<p>
So is this my doing? I observe that privacy will be eventually and<br>
inevitably be merely an anachronism, and yet, somehow I am also<br>
advocating the death of private life? Words are being put into my mouth<br>
as far as I can figure.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Erik Moeller, for instance, might be happy to do away with all</i><br>
<i>&gt; private life, once and for all, and condemn all human beings to</i><br>
<i>&gt; permanently live the life of a politician, but I suspect many here</i><br>
<i>&gt; would struggle to escape from such a fate. I know I would.</i><br>
<p>
Okay.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Mr. Celine, you've read your Wilson, but have you read your</i><br>
<i>&gt; Orwell?</i><br>
<p>
I am really unsure of what you are assuming about me. If thought Big<br>
Brother was inevitable, would this also mean I wanted it to happen? <br>
<p>
