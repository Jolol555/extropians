Speeking of these 'buttons', I have a question regarding them.  In the book<br>
'Dianetics', by L. Ron Hubbord (super mystic of the millenium), he talks of<br>
these 'buttons' as being something called 'engrams'.  I'm sure many of you<br>
are familiar with it.  I have always wondered to what extent the 'engram'<br>
theory may be true.  I don't believe in anything mystical, but I still wonder<br>
if there are any valid points in the book.  Perhaps one of you out there has<br>
a theory about 'engrams', and how we could use this knowledge in a<br>
non-mystical way.  Please let me know.<br>
