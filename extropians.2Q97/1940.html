I have great fondness for Cage.  He first created his music to animation on<br>
Sunset Boulevard above what is now the Whisky A-Go-Go.  There he and Oscar<br>
Fischinger (animator) explored symbolic imaging with sound.  I love what he<br>
did with Ju Ju (African for becoming emerged in the "play" of life - a type<br>
of Action Art where you see what happens next by fully participating in the<br>
art of life.)  Best experienced by the one doing it -;)<br>

Modern Art covers a century of art and many styles and art movements.  Its<br>
roots  can be seen in French 19th-century avant-garde throughout the late<br>
20th Century.  Modern Art subsets such as the Abstract Arts of Cubism,<br>
Abstract Expressionism , Fauvism, etc. are less literal (Impressionism,<br>
etc.)  than symbolic and noted for their design quality and color.<br>
(Mondrian, geometric shapes and monochromatic colors expresses a theory of<br>
universal harmony.)<br>
<p>
The Modern Art era completed and there was a fusion of Conceptual Art and<br>
Action Art, Performance Art and other genre's when Technological Art came to<br>
surface.  This was/is a fascinating period of art because we can watch art<br>
create itself vis-a-vis digital evolution and the Electronic Arts (Virtual<br>
Reality, A-Life.)  Simultaneously, Transhumanist  Art (1982)  grew into<br>
Extropic Art (1997) which is an art movement (subsets Automorph Art and<br>
Exoterra Art) combining imagination with critical thought.  Voila!<br>
