<i>&gt;&gt;     Greetings,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     There seems to be an abundance of interest in and information provided </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     about how to invest in the market economy.  I've yet to thoroughly </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     peruse some of the ideas and perspectives since the thread has </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     dominated recent digests I receive (although the idea of investing in </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     a company like Coca-cola, simply because of its yet untapped </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     markets--presumably in developing nations--seems disconnected from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     consequences both to health and environment that result from its mass </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;     consumption).  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm unsure about the environmental effects of Coke, but anyone who</i><br>
<i>&gt;had read much Extropian writings about health would avoid drinking </i><br>
<i>&gt;drinking high calorie, low vitamin foods such as regular Coke (the</i><br>
<i>&gt;health effects of diet Coke are less clear).</i><br>
<p>
I am perfectly willing to tailor my investments according to my values.<br>
Environmental health is one of those, but I don't see any environmental<br>
problems caused by Coke (anymore than result from any form of production in<br>
our pre-nano, only partially market-based system). As for health, which of<br>
course is a major value to me -- especially my own -- I drink Diet Coke<br>
sometimes, and don't believe it's harming me. Drinking a large quantity<br>
might be bad because of the phosphoric acid (informed feedback is welcome<br>
here), but I don't drink much. Sugary Coke shouldn't be bad for someone if<br>
they drink it *occasionally*. That choice is up to each individual. I do<br>
not see it as my duty to refrain from investing in Coke because some people<br>
choose to drink five cans of sugary Coke per day.<br>
