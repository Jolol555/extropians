<i>&gt; &gt; From: John Blanco-Losada &lt;jbl@clark.net&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Digging beyond the gut-level response, I'll admit that I had reservations</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; for many years about bringing a child into the world.  Look around - the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; forces of big government seem to be entrenched around the world, children</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; are being shot on the streets and in schools, couples are having to work </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; harder to make ends meet, etc.  I could go on and on.  It seems like the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; world is going down the toilet, and that things just aren't as good as </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they were when I was growing up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	We have none of that where we live.  Merchants take a two-hour</i><br>
<i>&gt; lunch and leave their outdoor displays and goods in place,</i><br>
<i>&gt; unguarded.  The stores leave such things as fertilizer, wood,</i><br>
<i>&gt; potting soil outside, unguarded at all times.</i><br>
<p>
I must say that even here in New York City, life isn't too bad. The<br>
continues to be run by socialists, but crime is not a particular day<br>
to day worry (the murder rate is down to mid 1960s levels), work is<br>
plentiful, and rent control may even end on June 15th if the<br>
Republicans in the State Senate have the balls to go through with what<br>
they've threatened -- if rent control goes away, housing prices will<br>
likely drop and the city will probably experience a renaissance of<br>
sorts.<br>
<p>
In general, I'm optimistic. Unlike any other time in human history,<br>
there is a low but good chance that we'll solve the aging problem<br>
before I drop dead, and I'm signed up for cryonics just in<br>
case. Business prospects for thinking people are better than ever<br>
before, and money nearly litters the streets provided you have the<br>
brains to pick it up.<br>
<p>
The odds of global thermonuclear war are down (although the odds of<br>
nuclear terrorism are up), and technology continues to develop<br>
unabated, leading to interesting results for all of us within fifty<br>
years or so.<br>
<p>
All in all, a good time to be alive.<br>
<p>
