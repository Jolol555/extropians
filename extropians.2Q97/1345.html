In the history of "the Blabber", we see that AFUTD is in our own future<br>
history, and even in AFUTD, we read that either Sjandra Kei, or the<br>
planet its founding fathers came from was settled directly from Earth.<br>
In "the Blabber", the attraction of the Blabber's world to those in the<br>
Transcend was that it had been settled only a hundred years or more<br>
previous by people directly from earth, only since they had been riding<br>
a subluminous "slowboat" they had been traveling for some 35,000 years<br>
in cold sleep at relativistic speeds, which is why they could<br>
realistically pull off a reproduction of a 20th century Michigan port<br>
city for the transcendant tourists. <br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Didn't the Zones contract around Tines World just before the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Countermeasure's final surge, so that Tines World was briefly</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Transcend? </i><br>
<p>
Yes, but that region was already at the bottom of the transcend, so that<br>
just prior to reaching the Tines world, Ravna and her pursuers hit breif<br>
pockets of slow zone, wherever the gravity gradient was too steep.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One thing we do know (from "The Blabber") is that Ravna is destined</i><br>
<i>&gt; to return to the Beyond, somehow.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
We don't however, know when she does in relation to AFUTD. In the<br>
Blabber, doesn't the ansible reply that the Tines interstellar empire<br>
(that they supposedly would build AFTER AFUTD) was a thousand or more<br>
years dead, and that the Revenge was blamed on them as an even worse<br>
blight than The Blight.<br>
