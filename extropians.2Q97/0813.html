(As a friend of mine said (who is an extropian and visiting) says, "If<br>
extropians are ever investigated for being a cult, we would be cleared of<br>
being a cult.")<br>
<p>
Michael Lorrey replied to Carl:<br>
<p>
"It was on April 1st, get it?"<br>
<p>
While Dan Sale mused:<br>
<p>
"Pretty soon, an "internet cult" is going to be defined as ...<br>
<p>
And Robert Schrader's commentary explained:<br>
<p>
"That was me posting nonsense on April 1st.  There is, to the best of my<br>
knowledge, no truth to it whatsoever.   It was totally the product of<br>
my deranged brain."<br>
<p>
This was a pretty funny joke, and I laughed out loud after the initial shock<br>
wave running through my veins.  Cults have very bad press - not my vision<br>
for association.<br>
<p>
Now, wouldn't it be just cryo to read one sunny morning:<br>
<p>
"A few weeks ago the Los Angeles Times, extropians were being interviewed<br>
for being international innovators of cultural change."<br>
