Subject: sc cfv<br>
<p>
                     FIRST CALL FOR VOTES (of 2)<br>
       moderated group sci.cryonics (moderates existing group)<br>
<p>
Newsgroups line:<br>
sci.cryonics            Cryonics and related topics. (Moderated)<br>
<p>
Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC, 29 May 1997.<br>
<p>
This vote is being conducted by a neutral third party.  Questions<br>
about the proposed group should be directed to the proponent.<br>
<p>
Proponent: Joe Strout &lt;jstrout@ucsd.edu&gt;<br>
Mentor: Jonathan Grobe &lt;grobe@netins.net&gt;<br>
<p>
Votetaker: David Bostwick &lt;bostwick@cas.chemistry.gatech.edu&gt;<br>
<p>
RATIONALE: sci.cryonics<br>
<p>
The existing unmoderated group sci.cryonics has been suffering from a<br>
decreasing signal/noise ratio.  In addition to the usual cross-posted<br>
spam, there have been numerous personal attacks of a highly offensive<br>
nature posted from anonymous remailers, as well as forged messages<br>
apparently from legitimate members of the group.  This traffic is<br>
damaging to the members of the group, as well as to the cryonics<br>
community as a whole.  Changing the newsgroup from unmoderated to<br>
moderated should greatly reduce the volume of such messages, and so<br>
enhance the value of the group.<br>
<p>
CHARTER: sci.cryonics<br>
<p>
Cryonic suspension is an experimental procedure whereby patients who<br>
can no longer be kept alive with today's medical abilities are<br>
preserved at low temperature for treatment in the future.  This<br>
newsgroup will be the place to keep up-to-date on topics related to<br>
cryonics, which include biochemistry of memory, low temperature<br>
biology, new cryonics-related research and publications, legal status<br>
of cryonics and cryonically suspended people, nanotechnology and cell<br>
repair machines, mass media coverage of cryonics, conferences, and<br>
local cryonics group meetings.<br>
<p>
Unacceptable messages include personal attacks, messages posted<br>
without a valid sender address, and any message not pertaining to the<br>
topics above.<br>
<p>
END CHARTER.<br>

<p>
IMPORTANT VOTING PROCEDURE NOTES:<br>
<p>
Standard Guidelines for voting apply.  One person, one vote.  Votes<br>
must be mailed directly from the voter to the votetaker.  Anonymous,<br>
forwarded or proxy votes are not valid.  Votes mailed by WWW/HTML/CGI<br>
forms are considered to be anonymous votes.<br>
<p>
Vote counting is automated.  Failure to follow these directions may<br>
mean that your vote does not get counted.  If you do not receive an<br>
acknowledgment of your vote within three days contact the votetaker<br>
about the problem.  It's your responsibility to make sure your vote<br>
is registered correctly.  Duplicate votes are resolved in favor of<br>
the most recent valid vote.  Addresses and votes of all voters will<br>
be published in the final voting results post.<br>
<p>
The purpose of a Usenet vote is to determine the genuine interest of<br>
persons who would read a proposed newsgroup.  Soliciting votes from<br>
uninterested parties defeats this purpose.  Please do not distribute<br>
this CFV.  If you must, direct people to the official CFV as posted<br>
to news.announce.newgroups.  Distributing pre-marked or otherwise<br>
edited copies of this CFV is generally considered to be vote fraud.<br>
When in doubt, ask the votetaker.<br>
<p>
HOW TO VOTE:<br>
<p>
Extract the ballot from the CFV by deleting everything before and after<br>
the "BEGINNING OF BALLOT" and "END OF BALLOT" lines.  Don't worry about<br>
the spacing of the columns or any quote characters ("&gt;") that your<br>
reply inserts.  Please do not send the entire CFV back to me.<br>
<p>
Fill in the ballot as shown below.  Please provde a valid name and<br>
indicate your desired vote in the appropriate locations inside the ballot.<br>
<p>
When finished, MAIL the ballot to: bostwick@cas.chemistry.gatech.edu<br>
Just "replying" to this message should work, but check the "To:" line.<br>
<p>
Examples of how to properly indicate your vote (do not vote here):<br>
<p>
  [ YES     ]  example.yes.vote<br>
  [ NO      ]  example.no.vote<br>
  [ ABSTAIN ]  example.abstention<br>
  [ CANCEL  ]  example.cancellation<br>
<p>
DO NOT modify, alter or delete any information in this ballot!<br>
If you do, the voting software will probably reject your ballot.<br>
<p>
If these instructions are unclear, please ask the votetaker.<br>
