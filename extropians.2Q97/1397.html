<i>&gt; nice.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; has a greater positive effect on the future of humanity than all my posting</i><br>

<i>&gt; a little more efficient.</i><br>
<p>
I have a similar priority view.<br>
<p>
Although I'm very interested in a transhuman future and try to orient<br>
myself to take advantage of potential "interesting" developments as<br>
they arise, that isn't what I think about all day long.<br>
<p>
I've taken certain concrete steps to try to try to assure my survival<br>
into the future -- I've signed up for cryonics, I try to eat as<br>
healthy a diet as I can, etc. -- and I try to take the probable<br>
direction of the future into account when planning my<br>
actions. However, the fact is, we aren't yet in the final slide into<br>
transhumanity or posthumanity, and for the most part there is very<br>
little to be done about such things on a day to day basis.<br>
<p>
Unlike Carl, I have no family, so my family isn't a priority. My #1<br>
priority is remaining healthy and conscious into the indefinate<br>
future, but I've already taken all steps I think can be reasonably<br>
taken in that regard. My #2 priority, which consumes most of my tiem,<br>
is assuring I have sufficient resources at my disposal to do whatever<br>
I feel might need doing in the future. Somewhere way down the list --<br>
far below the point where you can even assign numbers -- comes<br>
"participate in the extropian movement".<br>
<p>
Were a massive breakthrough in nanotech to occur next week, I suspect<br>
that my priorities would remain the same, although my means of<br>
achieving them might shift.<br>
<p>
I think this is as it should be. As an objectivist (but not a high<br>
church objectivist by any means!) I feel my top priority is caring for<br>
me and those things important to me, and given that I have no<br>
offspring to pay attention to, and no life partner, that pretty much<br>
just leaves me. Caring for myself implies assuring my survival, short<br>
term and long term, and trying to (on a slightly higher level) plan<br>
ahead to make sure I have the resources needed to achieve things I want.<br>
<p>
Perhaps sometime I'll discover there is some way I could save the<br>
world, but if its worth saving, its worth saving only if I personally<br>
need it saved, or if a profit is to be earned in the process of saving<br>
it.<br>
<p>
What, then, does Extropianism mean for me?<br>
<p>
Well, it provides me with an augmented world view and a community of<br>
friends. This has had concrete dividends -- I actually took the step<br>
of signing up for cryonics after becoming surrounded by other<br>
cryonicists, for example. I've gained some perspective and some<br>
entertainment out of the community, and I'm happy about that. So long<br>
as it continues to pay off a bit in this way, I'll continue reading.<br>
