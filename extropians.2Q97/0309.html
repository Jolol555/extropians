I missed the beginning of this, apologies for the unattributed quote:<br>
<i>&gt; &lt;It might feel that, since our ability to interpret the state of other </i><br>
<i>&gt; people is largely subconscious - just think of those pheromones. We </i><br>
<p>
It may not have been on this list, but I recall having a discussion <br>
on empathy.  At that time, I mentioned that in the relatively new <br>
areas of study involving emotional skills, psychological experiments <br>
have been conducted on children to determine how they develop empathy <br>
and how that development can become stunted.  Empathy is considered <br>
by psychologists and conflict resolution practitioneers to be a <br>
learned skill and as such, one's abilities can be enhanced in that <br>
area.  Conflict resolution trainings teach people methods of <br>
increasing the use of empathic skills in problematic situations, and <br>
this is done from the standpoint that much of what we consider <br>
'subconcious' is actually 'unconcious'.  I agree that there is a <br>
point at which our limbic systems take control, but an increased <br>
self-awareness can bring some of the process into our control.<br>
<p>
As an example, I could use the people that make themselves known as <br>
'psychics'.  In actuality, according to the histories of the slavic <br>
peoples, gypsy fortunetellers could be considered the first <br>
therapists, because they had developed empathic skills to a degree that <br>
they could cloak them in mystic rigaromole and render sage advice to <br>
others.  Modern 'psychics' often play the same role, focusing their <br>
attention and acumen on perceiving what sort of state a person is in <br>
and then using that as a basis for making 'predictions' that are <br>
usually just commonsense advice.  In societies where psychiatry has <br>
not been widely accepted, astrologers and fortunetellers fulfill the <br>
roles of therapist and advisor.  <br>
