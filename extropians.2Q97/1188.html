or, Keeping Abreast of the ongoing Information Tsunami <br>
<p>
I am currently confronted with a common problem,<br>
namely: how to manage one's mail. As soon similiar<br>
trouble will probably plague other users, an ad<br>
hoc analysis seems to be in order. Feel free to<br>
dissect this to a bloody rag.<br>
<p>
First, I am overwhelmed by sheer traffic volume.<br>
Chronically infoglut infected (EPrime=me) tend to<br>
homeostate their load up to the tolerance level<br>
(and sometimes beyond), but the personal<br>
infoprocessing resources _do_ fluctuate over<br>
time. Should I become suddenly unable to access<br>
my mail for several days (as happened recently<br>
when my (notoriously unreliable, since academic)<br>
ISP was down), processing the backlog can be<br>
demanding, and scanning a month worth of mail is<br>
beyond human (well, at least well beyond my current)<br>
mental (fuzzy-brained) and bodily (chronically<br>
bleary-eyed, carpal tunnel syndrome/RSI ridden<br>
;) capabilities.<br>
<p>
When in transit, accessing one's mail via<br>
a cellular link and a laptop seems also a good<br>
idea.<br>
<p>
The most straightforward solution would be to be<br>
able to cut off the bulk of the information stream,<br>
but the most vital data by one invocation. The<br>
simplest implementation for this would be to utilize<br>
(at least) two email addresses, one for important,<br>
low-traffic personal mail, and one for publicly<br>
visible bulk traffic. Furthermore, a means to<br>
(un)subscribe to one's mailing lists in one<br>
step (or the reply-less equivalent of the<br>
*NIX vacation program) seems to be useful.<br>
<p>
(At least) 95% of everything is trash. So is<br>
incoming mail. About 1-5% of everything I retain<br>
for possible future reference. The simplest way to<br>
reduce the percentile of trash (so I can subscribe<br>
to even more mailing lists to max out on traffic)<br>
is to block out certain posters (particularly certain<br>
kooks, who generate many a wealth of redundant<br>
posts) -- the classical killfile. I guess it is<br>
not too difficult to implement a personalized<br>
killfile filter via a perl script, which I intend<br>
to do pretty soon, once the Linux box is done (btw<br>
Linux, there is much ado hereabouts, as the (press)<br>
mainstream has suddenly became aware of it). This<br>
is also a first, albeit weak protection dam against<br>
unsolicited mail, aka spam, since one might mark<br>
certain domains for killfile targets with a single<br>
(space-cadet) keystroke. I am not sure forged<br>
mail headers are a good means for dealing with bot<br>
scans, though I might be forced to accept this<br>
easy solution, as absolute spam load has become<br>
pretty intolerable on some days. I still think<br>
that, apart from banishing <a href="mailto:">mailto:</a> tags from one's<br>
web site (never came around to do this), this must<br>
be handled by mailing list majordomo sofware,<br>
which must substitute web-accessible archives<br>
with local-visible-only mailing list users<br>
handles, and which additionally limits access<br>
to mailing lists by trivial (mail-back ack with a<br>
one-time random token) or sophisticated (grant<br>
of full membership by invoking majority decisions<br>
of the inner circle, after a thorough scan of<br>
applyers mail history) mechanisms.<br>
<p>
Other thing plaguing me is inability to access<br>
important, stored mail. Years worth of compressed,<br>
'gene-filtered traffic lie around on several machines,<br>
virtually inaccessible. A mail database, and full-text<br>
index are a must, I guess. As I am determined to use<br>
(x)emacs for a generic tool, and it can browse HTML,<br>
I think using mSQL and w3-msql might be not a bad<br>
choice. (I'd be thankful for pointers if anybody is<br>
aware of a better PD dbase with a web interface).<br>
<p>
Lacking truly smart filters (whatever happened to<br>
Cyc?), we must still rely on human agents. I am<br>
sure informal users groups forwarding user-prescanned<br>
information are pretty common, what we need is to<br>
formalize this approach. We must approve a panel<br>
of high-selectivity web/usenet/mailing list<br>
scanners, who feed their results into dedicated<br>
channels. Thanks, Damien (cum shillelagh) for the<br>
idea.<br>
<p>
I volunteer for a scanner. Anybody else?<br>
<p>
ciao,<br>
