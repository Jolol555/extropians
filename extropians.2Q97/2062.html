<i>&gt;Somebody mentioned that bit about yelling fire in a crowded theater, I said:</i><br>
<i>&gt;    </i><br>
<i>&gt; That cliche originally came from the American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes </i><br>
<i>&gt; (1841-1935), he used it in one of his decisions that upheld the conviction  </i><br>
<i>&gt; of a man imprisoned for saying America should not be in the First World War. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Years later Holmes said it was the worst decision he made in his entire </i><br>
<i>&gt; legal career and he cringed whenever he heard somebody quoting his famous </i><br>
<i>&gt; saying.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Several have written me asking for a source.  The decision was called  </i><br>
<i>&gt;"Schenck vs United States" and came out in 1919, you can read about it on </i><br>
<i>&gt;page 942 of "The Oxford Companion To The Supreme Court" edited by Kermit L  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Hall. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On page 422 of the book "Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes"  by G Edward White is  </i><br>
<i>&gt;a letter Holmes wrote to a friend talking about this and several similar  </i><br>
<i>&gt;decisions he wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "I greatly regretted having to write them and, between ourselves, that the   </i><br>
<i>&gt;  government pressed them".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In another letter he expressed his sorrow, and I don't think guilt would be </i><br>
<i>&gt;too strong a word, that Schenck was still in jail:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "I hope the president will pardon him and some other poor devils I have  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  more sympathy"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It's ironic that in his day Holmes was one of the leading advocates of free </i><br>
<i>&gt;speech but today his most remembered saying is used by those who wish to  </i><br>
<i>&gt;stifle it.                                      </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;                                            John K Clark    johnkc@well.com</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

Yes. Prosecuting someone who falsely yells "Fire!" in a crowded theater is<br>
not an infringement of free speech. The ticket purchaser and the theater<br>
owner have<br>
entered into a contract. The ticket purchaser has bought a ticket to view a<br>
performance. It's contract law and property rights, not a free speech issue.<br>
