     There is at least a modicum of interest in deriding those on which we <br>
     slap the label "New Age" or "Fundamentalist".  Both have their whacko <br>
     extremes.  But as we can often observe, things are not quite so black <br>
     and white (I have to constantly resist the urge to stridently classify <br>
     things tidily).  What about a New Age Rationalist?  Sound far-fetched. <br>
     If I were to label myself, it might be something to that effect.  I <br>
     need/desire proof but don't demand it to form an opinion.  Facts get <br>
     me more intrigued and bought into a prospect.  Is my "self" existent <br>
     beyond my present physicality.  I don't *know*.  I can believe but <br>
     belief is merely a choice.  I have reached the point, past years of <br>
     religious indoctrination and trying to find the "right path" that it's <br>
     folly to try to argue/prove a "belief" system.  <br>
     <br>
     My belief system on that which cannot be currently/rationally proven <br>
     is kind of like "I wonder what Greece is like this time of year?"  I <br>
     entertain the notions but don't get plagued by them and constantly <br>
     embellish them.<br>
     <br>
     Rationalism taken to its extreme could ostensibly be as myopic and <br>
     therefore, potentially limited as the belief-bound fundie/new age'r.  <br>
     <br>
     I consider things such as scientific thought on the dimensions of the <br>
     Earth prior to Columbus, the nature of light prior to scientific study <br>
     in this and part of the last century.  Things ubiquitous are often <br>
     accepted at face value or without need of compelling evidence.  It may <br>
     yet be discovered that consciousness isn't just a wonderfully evolved <br>
     network of chemically activated neuron firings but a self-contained <br>
     spectrum of energy utilizing the biology of the brain.  An energy <br>
     domain existing above/beyond the spectrum of light (a domain on which <br>
     we are no doubt still getting volumes of new information).<br>
     <br>
     While some things are "known" as to their possible or impossible <br>
     nature, others still reside in the speculative realm.  The "New Age" <br>
     (whatever that means) belief may not be substantive but it may yet <br>
     carry something intuitive, archetypal or as Sheldrake expressed <br>
     "morphogenic".  These ideas/thoughts/beliefs may not appear rational <br>
     and may never be proven as such and can thus, be easily dismissed.  <br>
     Conversely, wives waited dutifully on the shore so that their husbands <br>
     would have an assurance that if they went out of sight, they wouldn't <br>
     fall off the world.  Scientific knowledge, as large as it looms in our <br>
     age of information, may yet be scratching the surface of what is <br>
     known.  And who knows, as some New Age types have been known to <br>
     express (also me under the influence of psychedelics), maybe we're <br>
     just making it up as we go along...<br>
     <br>
     Keeps things interesting I'd suspect.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
