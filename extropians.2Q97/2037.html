<i>&gt; I wonder if the founding fathers in declaring the right of free speech </i><br>
<i>&gt; imagined multi-national companies with huge advertising budgets, ...</i><br>
<p>
No need to wonder, just go look up their actual words.  Yes, they did<br>
indeed imagine just that; large multi-national trading companies and<br>
advertising existed then just as they do now, and Jefferson himself<br>
said that he preferred the advertisements in a newpaper to the editorials<br>
because they contained more truth.<br>
<p>
Becoming wealthy does not cause one to lose human rights.  Advertising<br>
is free expression, and always has been, even of the court has only<br>
recently started to recognize that plain fact (the Coors case, etc.)<br>
<p>
It is an insult to the human mind to suggest that it is not capable<br>
of judging for itself the value of information it receives, and a<br>
exercise of boundless blind faith to suggest that any government is<br>
more capable of such judgment than anyone with &gt;80 IQ.  I, for one,<br>
am capable of judging for myself, and I refuse to concede my right<br>
to do so to any government.  Caveat Lector.<br>
