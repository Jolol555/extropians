The March 3 1997 issue of Fortune carried a survey (based on 13,000<br>
responses) of the Most Admired Companies. This was broken down into eight<br>
attributes of reputation. One of the categories: Community and<br>
Environmental Responsibility. Guess who ranked number 1? Coca-Cola.<br>
<p>
[Aside to Peter McCluskey: Coke also ranked no.1 in the category Value as a<br>
Long-Term Investment. This information had nothing to do with my choice,<br>
which I made before seeing that result, but adds to my confidence in my<br>
analysis of the company's prospects.]<br>

Aspartame:<br>
<i>&gt;     Ever since aspartame </i><br>

<i>&gt;     There is no direct proof that aspartame caused the brain tumors, but </i><br>

<i>&gt;     Minutes" recently did a report linking the increase in brain cancer to </i><br>
<i>&gt;     aspartame use.  </i><br>
<p>
Somehow this does not convince me at all. TV shows frequently produce<br>
reports that aim at ratings more than truth.<br>
     <br>
Regarding the studies you mention, I appreciate your information, but must<br>
point out that it shows nothing. You omitted information essential to any<br>
rational assessment of the studies. Practically any substance will induce<br>
tumors or other problems in sufficient doses. You said nothing about the<br>
doses or whether the animals respond to aspartame in the same way as<br>
humans. This would certainly not be the first time that claims of health<br>
problems have been based on bad science. Remember the Alar scare?<br>
<p>
I do not claim that you're wrong about aspartame. Just that you have not<br>
given adequate reason to accept your claims.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;     Yes, humans make their own decisions as I am profoundly aware with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;     loss of both my parents this year to lung-related illness due to </i><br>
<i>&gt;     smoking.  But some humans are less capable of others of making sound </i><br>
<i>&gt;     decisions and that factor must be considered before one shrugs off </i><br>
<i>&gt;     consequences. [snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt;     </i><br>
<i>&gt;     If someone drinks their way to obesity or diabetes, the subtle </i><br>
<i>&gt;     rippling effect of that dis-ease manifests in the community, in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;     culture. Might not the extropian aim be not so much altruistic as </i><br>
<i>&gt;     quintessentially noble?</i><br>
<p>
I do not choose to be paternalistic to that degree. People need to learn to<br>
make responsible choices. I will not avoid investments because some people<br>
will abuse the product of the company. My choices here reflect a spectrum<br>
and I cannot draw a sharp line: there are companies and industries that I<br>
will not invest in because the product is, according to my assessment, just<br>
too easily abused. I will not invest in a tobacco company, even though I<br>
grant that smoking two or three cigarettes per day probably does you no<br>
harm. While my mother for many years smoked exactly one cigaretter per day<br>
(two on Christmas Day and her birthday) I know that few people restrain<br>
themselves. I prefer to seek profit from investments that do not have such<br>
negative health effects (especially since I loathe cigarrette smoke and<br>
give some credence to studies showing the effects of secondhand smoke).<br>
<p>
On the issue of values, I will also note that my investment priorities will<br>
vary depending on my circumstances. When I am wealthy, I may be even more<br>
strict about refusing to invest in companies that have less extropic<br>
effects than I'd like. I will be willing to take a lower return in order to<br>
invest in the most extropic companies. However, the less my wealth, the<br>
more flexible (within limits noted above) I  will be in order to get a<br>
higher return. A very high priority for me is to secure my financial<br>
position. I consider this a highly extropic thing to do.<br>
<p>
Although I disagree with your critique of my investment choice, I<br>
appreciate your raising the issue. I agree completely that investment<br>
decisions should reflect our values. However, my assessment of the facts,<br>
and probably also my values, differ from yours.<br>
<p>
Onward!<br>
