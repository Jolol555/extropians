<i>&gt; Dear fellow Extropians:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you think about it a bit more seriously there is a germ of an idea</i><br>
<i>&gt; there. From a more pragmatic perspective it might be more effective</i><br>
to<br>
<i>&gt; work from within the structure of an existing major political</i><br>
<i>&gt; organization and modify its direction in order to help advance</i><br>
society<br>
<i>&gt; more directly. Logic would indicate that the political organization</i><br>
you<br>
<i>&gt; might want to consider changing is that organization which is the</i><br>
least<br>
<i>&gt; progressive and least representative of our diverse culture. I think</i><br>
you<br>
<i>&gt; can all figure out which party that is. </i><br>
<i>&gt; What do you all think about that one?</i><br>
<p>
The Communist Party? <br>
<p>
Seriously though. Looking at the growth of the reform party, it's easy<br>
to see that big things are possible. Even if your leader is insane.<br>
(Well, that would describe the Nazi's too.) Look at the last US<br>
Presidential election. The Libertarian party didnt even finish 4th.<br>
They finished 5th. Ralph Nader and the Green Party finished 4th.<br>
(Albeit many california/Alaska/Hawaii voters voted for him out of<br>
spite in last minute voting because ABC/CBS/NBC/CNN had already<br>
declared clinton the winner.)<br>
<p>
What it all proves, however, is that Americans in particular are ready<br>
for multipartisan politics. Winning elections today has nothing to do<br>
with right ideas, vision, drive, determination, sincerity, or<br>
integrity. It is a matter of having a candidate who is Photogenic,<br>
quick witted, and able to 'handle' the press. Because honestly, most<br>
voters base their decision on who to vote for based on what the press<br>
tells them. Bob Dole lost the presidential election not because he<br>
supported tobacco companies, not because he was republican, but<br>
because he was older, not photogenic, cold, and aloof. Clinton, with<br>
all of his whitewater/travel office/paula jones/funding baggage won<br>
handily because he handles the press better.<br>
<p>
So as extropians looking at the political arena, we must look at the<br>
best "Intelligent Technology" to win elections. THAT is the prime<br>
directive of a party today. You win elections first, make change<br>
later. We need a slick, savvy, intelligent, photogenic person as a<br>
mouthpiece, and once elected, work change from the shadows. Deceitful?<br>
perhaps. The way things are done already in most other parties?<br>
Definitely.<br>
<p>
Take a look at the Libertarians and Howard Stern's Gubernatorial bid<br>
for New York. My personal opinion is that he would have won. (Only in<br>
New York, sheesh) He stated from the beginning that he would take<br>
office, reinstitute the death penalty, and step down. Leaving, of<br>
course, the lieutenant governor, a trusted hand picked libertarian<br>
insider, as Governor. Stern says he dropped out because he didnt want<br>
to disclose his income on the forms. I think he got cold feet because<br>
he thought he would win. (ED Note: I dislike mostly everything about<br>
Howard Stern)<br>
<p>
As a 28 year old, I cannot run in the important elections for another<br>
7 years. There is an Ohio Senatorial race in my 35th year, and I will<br>
be running.<br>
<p>
