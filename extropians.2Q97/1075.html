The following is from 'Love Your Body', Viktoras Kulvinkas, M.S.:<br>
<p>
"Most people suffer digestive disorders...the biggest villian is serving<br>
two concentrated foods that are hard to digest at the same meal. Man's<br>
digestive tract was not made to be a receptacle for an 8 course meal<br>
containing a wide array of poisons...The typical combination of meat,<br>
potatoes (sic), butter or margarine, a glass of milk along with an array<br>
of highly processed carbohydrates (bread, pastries), has produced the<br>
sickest nation on this planet.<br>
<p>
"Protein requires acid digestive juices, while starch and sweet food<br>
requirte alkaline. You cannot digest both at the same time. Dairy products<br>
are highly alkaline, so they interfere with meat digestion. Fat interferes<br>
with protein digestion.<br>
<p>
"Poorly combined food remains too many hours in the digestive tract. In<br>
this warm environment it rots and/or ferments, producing a wide range of<br>
poisons, headache, and an unloving disposition.<br>
<p>
"Vegetables take longer to digest than fruit; combining them in a single<br>
meal can cause fermentation."<br>
<p>
<p>
The guy is a bit of a hippie and he needs a better proofreader but what he<br>
is saying seems to make sense. He gives a chart of good/bad combinations:<br>
<p>
Good:<br>
<p>
Protein and leafy greens<br>
Starch and veg.<br>
Oil and leafy greens.<br>
Oil and acid fruit.<br>
Oil and subacid fruit (non-citrus I guess)<br>
<p>
Poor:<br>
<p>
Protein and acid fruit<br>
Leafy greens and acid fruit<br>
Leafy Greens and subacid fruit<br>
<p>
Bad:<br>
<p>
Protein and starch<br>
Oil and protein<br>
Starch and fruit<br>
<p>
<p>
Thought this above may be interesting to list members.<br>
<p>
This is the only book on nutrition that I possess, can anyone recomend any<br>
other/better sources?<br>
