Thanks for that feedback. Since you and Perry seem to have some<br>
differences, I'd be interested to hear if Perry agrees. <br>

<p>
Of course, but if you don't yet have enough money to diversify, the next<br>
best thing is to pick one very safe stock. Given the markets still opening<br>
to Coca Cola, I think it's a very safe bet. I intend to hold the stock for<br>
many years.<br>
