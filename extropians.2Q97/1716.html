     In my original post I posed:<br>
     <br>
<i>     &gt; Could the torch possibly be ready to pass from physical</i><br>
<i>     &gt; matter-bound immortality to a lighter energy form?</i><br>
     <br>
     Anders Sandberg replied:<br>
     <br>
     Personally I think this is the logical step, although I would not<br>
     call it a "lighter energy form" (that term in my opinion reeks of<br>
     cheap new age). I think information is the future. Information is of<br>
     course always implemented in matter or energy, but the point is that<br>
     it can be abstracted and copied into new matrices (this shows me to<br>
     be a believer in the Strong AI Hypothesis); information is the<br>
     "light energy" which can be easily transferred, stored, mutated and<br>
     evolved.<br>
     <br>
     I respond:<br>
     <br>
     Don't take this the wrong way (i.e. defensively) but I continue to <br>
     find it intriguing how certain terms are a sure-fire trigger for this <br>
     group.  While there are plenty of topics in the heap of dogma branded <br>
     "New Age", I see nothing illogical, inappropriate or even <br>
     simple-minded about a description like "lighter energy form".  Mass <br>
     wise, this is a no-brainer.  <br>
     <br>
     When a judgment like this is slapped on a term because of its <br>
     associative meanings with ideologies (apprently) incongruous with <br>
     extropian thinking, I immediately am compelled to leave the main topic <br>
     and explore the reflexive nature of such a response such as "cheap new <br>
     age".  A little trite and unnecessary in intellectual discourse except <br>
     to clarify a discomfort or prejudice.  And if that was necessary, I'm <br>
     intrigued to drill down into the "why". <br>
     <br>
