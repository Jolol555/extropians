        Then why not kill him in the first place?  If someone presents a<br>
significant (and proven) danger to others, then why risk the safety of the<br>
family?  If someone murdered my son, daughter, sister or anyone close to me,<br>
I would not even dream of wanting that person around.  I'm sure that<br>
rationality would be quite blind to me for awhile, and I would probably take<br>
it into my own hands to kill him.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;4. In a Friedman-like system he'd probably become an outlaw and anyone who </i><br>

<p>
        But still, letting him roam freely would be jeopardizing others; why<br>
compromise the safety and life of others when it is truly unnecessary?<br>
"Claim" or no, I still value my life more than my money...I think most<br>
people are that way.  Perhaps I am slightly unclear on your concept --I have<br>
not read any of Friedman's books-- but from what I can tell, it seems that<br>
you are advocating a claimed parole on dangerous offenders.  If I am<br>
mistaken, please correct me.  What I want to emphasize is that execution and<br>
incarceration are sometimes necessary...though most certainly not<br>
state-sanctioned.  If someone decides to take other people's lives away, why<br>
should he be able to walk away freely?  If he caused a family pain, grief,<br>
and a lifetime of longing for their lost relative, should there not be an<br>
effect.  As I said in my last post, all crimes are committed with different<br>
circumstances; what I advocate is to find a fair way to judge the<br>
circumstances and make a subsequent decision.  The only question is *how*.<br>
