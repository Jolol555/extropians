The original claim was "I heard from someone that little bugs keep our<br>
eyelashes in. And when our eyelashes fall out its because the bugs die."<br>
The NOVA reference Mr. Quinn provided did not mention this phenomenon;<br>
the above text seems to contradict it.  <br>

Mr. Quinn's statement that "Its true. The human body is more than just<br>
human cells---it a symbiosis with several other species in benign<br>
interactions like these." is not entirely to the point.  That lots of<br>
beasties live on us is not only true, it is rather old news as far as I<br>
am concerned.  That mites keep our eyelashes in has had no evidence<br>
presented in its favor, and was the idea which caused much<br>
righteous furor.<br>

problem by lying down on the paper.  I don't know if that tactic is the<br>
product of calculation of trial and error -- but it works."<br>
