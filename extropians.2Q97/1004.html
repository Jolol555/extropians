Yes .. <br>
    Last summer I attended a program at McGill University, here in Montreal,<br>
for high school students interested in science. We visited various<br>
scientific departments, as well as sites off campus. One of the dept's we<br>
visited was I believe physiology or biology, where they were doing<br>
experiments with snails. Since snails are myogenic, meaning their organs<br>
still function outside of their body, they actually had a snail, minus skin,<br>
splayed out on a sheet of lucite, still quite alive. They said that snails<br>
have a very small amount of neurons (like under 1000), it would be possible<br>
to create a remote controll snail. <br>
What's interesting about this is that small organisms with simple brains can<br>
have some very advanced structures (like dragonflies' eyes) so it would be<br>
possible to interface those biological apparatti to computers...<br>
