{I think I'll respond to the original post, since we seem to have gotten<br>
off on a tangent about emotional programmers. Geoff will have to forgive me<br>
if I steal his words.  And since this is related to that thread on Proton<br>
Pseudo-Translation, here I'll argue against the point I made in that thread.}<br>

  Just because emotions were evolved earliest doesn't mean they will be<br>
easier to replicate in human-designed computers.  Much of the impetus for<br>
the 80's work on connectionism was the interesting fact that we had made<br>
computers that could deal with all the very difficult "thinking" of<br>
academics and scientist but that couldn't do what a 18month-old could (like<br>
walk, see, recognize Mommy).  With all those various brain structures<br>
devoted to who-knows-what, it could be that feeling requires far more<br>
computational power than thinking or seeing.  And integrating feeling with<br>
the rest of cognition may be pretty tricky or require a whole new<br>
computational model.<br>
<p>
Mind you, we've gotten pretty far since then, using programs modeled after<br>
neural systems, in replicating vision and motor functions.  Just because it<br>
isn't easier than replicating the higher functions doesn't mean it's<br>
actually hard...<br>
