Robert A. Freitas Jr. describes a trick for making research<br>
academically respectable by stating a conservative end as the<br>
prinicpal objective, while downplaying the will true objective. I<br>
think this happens all the time in academia (my current research<br>
project is about memory consolidation, but my hidden agenda is of<br>
course to understand nootropics).<br>
<p>
In biomedical engineering there is a huge, very virtuous goal:<br>
helping the disabled. If we could make good neurointerfaces making<br>
prosthesises would become much easier and disabled people would be<br>
helped. Not to mention the spin-off effects in neuroscience and<br>
biosignalling. This is obviously a reasonable goal, and would have a<br>
good chance of getting funding. <br>
<p>
Note that in biomedical engineering matters are routinely discussed<br>
that makes most laypeople quite nervous (implants, how to change<br>
tissues, applying genetic engineering to create custom surfaces) but<br>
they are accepted because they are obviously made for reasonable<br>
ends. And once the technology has been developed, it can be used for<br>
other things, just look at how the piercing industry has adapted some<br>
biomaterials. <br>
