<i>&gt; } Apparently, at least one member of this select circle has not upgraded to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; } browser that can read HTML. In an attempt to please a possible minority of</i><br>
<i>&gt; } one (at least until he upgrades) I'll write in plain script.</i><br>
<p>
As a twelve year Internet veteran, let me first correct your terminology:<br>
all "browsers" read HTML; that's their job.  Some of them also read mail,<br>
which isn't their job, but many people think it is.  Email has been<br>
around for a lot longer than the web has, and has developed its own<br>
standards over time to allow interchange between the millions of<br>
systems supporting it, hundreds of thousands of which have never even<br>
heard of HTML.  Email programs support lots of features that have<br>
developed over those years to make email more powerful and useful.<br>
Many browsers fail to support many of those features, and instead like<br>
to make up their own standards outside of the Internet community so<br>
they can brag about "features" that have already been available in<br>
standardized forms.<br>
<p>
HTML is not and has never been a valid format for email.  It has<br>
never been endorsed by any standards organization, it is not supported<br>
by most serious email programs, and is a serious waste of bandwidth<br>
and nuisance to those of us who use real email programs.  The MIME<br>
format "text/enriched" /is/ a valid format, and less intrusive, and<br>
understood by real email programs (but not, alas, by the idiots who<br>
write Netscape mail and MS Exchange, so it should still be avoided).<br>
<p>
All communication requires standards.  Without them, one would have<br>
to tailor every communication to its specific audience, which is the<br>
impossible state of affairs the standards were created to avoid.<br>
Where the standards fail, expanding them is justified.  But where they<br>
work well, and have worked well for years, flagrantly violating them<br>
is pointless and rude.<br>
<p>
P.S. Thanks for the opportunity to expand ny Web page's rant about<br>
standards.  The email nonsense hadn't occurred to me at the time. :)<br>
