 This basic idea makes sense, but it is important to base your belief<br>
that it's a safe bet on something other than what other investors are<br>
currently thinking, or you will generally end up buying fads. Personal<br>
knowledge of the quality of a company's product/service/technology is<br>
usually the right kind of approach to picking safe long-term investments.<br>
 Your attitude towards Coca Cola sounds more like something you have<br>
picked up from popular investment ideas rather than independent analysis.<br>
 It may be very safe to bet that Coca Cola's earnings will continue<br>
to grow around 18%/year, but at a price/earnings ratio of 47 I would<br>
say that the market has already discounted 8-10 years of this kind of<br>
growth. Most earnings forecasts more than 5 years into the future are<br>
worthless.<br>
