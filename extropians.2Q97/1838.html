WILLIAM WISER:<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  (Skim)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I will make the argument to my own values short.  I think it’s </i><br>
<i>&gt;  really cool.  I like an awful lot of things.  I am having a lot </i><br>
<i>&gt;  of fun in life and there are a ton of things to do.  I think the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  future is going to be pretty bright and look forward to </i><br>
<i>&gt;  participating in it.  I can’t see how my survival will doom </i><br>
<i>&gt;  humanity so I don’t even need to weight the relative value of </i><br>
<i>&gt;  my survival and theirs.  I could conceivably be wrong and the </i><br>
<i>&gt;  future may be very grim indeed, but I doubt I will be forced </i><br>
<i>&gt;  to stay alive in such a world.</i><br>
<p>
; - )  WELL SAID<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  Now what I want is a relatively sound set of arguments and </i><br>
<i>&gt;  techniques that convince other people that my longevity is good </i><br>
<i>&gt;  or at least neutral and their longevity is also (thus generating </i><br>
<i>&gt;  customers and co-workers while simultaneously being a very helpful </i><br>
<i>&gt;  fellow). </i><br>
<p>
I think the future AND the present look pretty bright, and I ALSO like a ton<br>
of stuff, I participate in tons *more* of that stuff than most people do, and<br>
I intend to survive longer, prosper and be healthier becuse of it! Some other<br>
folks will see how amazingly resilient and strong this makes me and mimic it,<br>
and perhaps survive as well...<br>
