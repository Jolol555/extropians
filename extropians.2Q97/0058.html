In a message dated 97-04-03 13:11:13 EST, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; generation of intelligence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    If I ever get a chance to reprogram myself, I would put emotions</i><br>
<i>&gt;  under complete control, so that, when I want, I could turn off the bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;  ones, and feel the selected good ones.  So that the emotions would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  be used only for fun, and will not stand in the way of decision-making</i><br>
<i>&gt;  processes, where they tend to mess things up, even when the goal of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  decision-making is to optimize future emotions.</i><br>
<p>
I would suggest that this might hamper decision making as well, for it would<br>
disable the program that can tell the difference between a pleasurable<br>
outcome and an unpleasant one. For example you could switch off the bad<br>
feelings just before you went into battle, or executed a risky plan that had<br>
50- 50 chance - And in case it came out wrong, and you would still "feel"<br>
good about your decision, even if things went terribly awry. <br>
If everything turns to shit, you're in jail or broke, or whatever, just<br>
amplify the good feelings and what's the difference?<br>
