&lt;I see nothing illogical, inappropriate or even simple-minded about a<br>

<p>
This is a ‘cheap, New Age’ description to me because it provides<br>
absolutely no useful information about how such a form of existence<br>
functions or how to attain it. ‘Energy’ is much too simplistic a<br>
description of something as complex as life, knowledge and experience. <br>
<p>
Your earlier statements about wanting to fly like an eagle or<br>
experience the sensations of other creatures seem inconsistent: One<br>
the one hand you say, "matter-bound existence seriously limits the<br>
quality and quantity of experience gathering", and then you talk about<br>
"instilling my matter-emancipated consciousness into other physical<br>
manifestations and assimilating the ‘knowing’ of  the experience into<br>
my being."  The question is, what is this "being"? Calling it "energy"<br>
just doesn’t cut it for me. <br>
<p>
Perhaps you are really just unsatisfied with your current physical<br>
manifestation and want to experience others, not abandon physical<br>
manifestations altogether.  I think this is what we all want, but I<br>
don’t think that talking wistfully about "energy forms" is going to<br>
get you there!<br>
<p>
As Anders said:<br>
&lt; We need to be embodied in some sense to have experiences, to be able<br>
to grow.&gt;<br>
<p>
Or, perhaps you feel that the ‘you’ you experience in dreaming, or<br>
during meditative and psychedelic experiences, is this "lighter energy<br>
form" AND it is ALREADY your PRIMARY being. For example, Terence<br>
McKenna has suggested:<br>
<p>
&lt; the dream is a higher-order spatial dimension. In sleep one is<br>
released into the real world of which the world of waking is only the<br>
surface in a very literal geometrical sense ... We are not primarily<br>
biological, with mind emerging as a kind of iridescence, a kind of<br>
epiphenomenon at the higher levels of organization of biology. We are,<br>
in fact, hyperspatial objects of some sort which cast a shadow into<br>
matter. The shadow in matter is our physical organism.&gt;<br>
<p>
Even if this is true, and I don’t think it is (biology comes first<br>
IMO), it’s still an inadequate description for achieving that state<br>
even psychically, let alone in some permanent physical way.<br>
<p>
I find it interesting to note that Catholic theologians distinguish<br>
"four properties of the resurrected body: Incapability of suffering<br>
(also called IMPASSIBILITY), meaning that we will no longer suffer<br>
physical evils such as sorrow, sickness or death; SUBTILITY, meaning<br>
that we will have a spiritualized nature, in the sense of a spiritual<br>
body ... AGILITY, meaning that the body will obey the soul with the<br>
greatest of ease and speed of movement; and CLARITY, meaning that the<br>
body will be free from any deformity and will be filled with beauty<br>
and radiance." <br>
<p>
Inadequate as this is, it is still a much more functional and<br>
prescriptive description of what you seem to be seeking than "lighter<br>
energy form".  (It might even have some applicability for how virtual<br>
beings would navigate in cyberspace.) It’s also interesting how<br>
similar these properties are to the four 'Gates of Dreaming' that<br>
Carlos Casteneda describes in his 1993 book, _The Art of Dreaming_,<br>
but I won’t go into that (some possibly practical exercises but still<br>
too much mushy talk about ‘energy bodies’).<br>
<p>
If you really do believe this, that you are already this ‘energy body’<br>
and it is primary, then you really have nothing to worry about: once<br>
your current physical manifestation dies, your ‘soul’ will just move<br>
on to another level of existence.  No need to do anything special in<br>
this world except keep your karma clean! (so that you don’t ‘come<br>
back’ as a cockroach, for example, instead of an eagle ;-)<br>
