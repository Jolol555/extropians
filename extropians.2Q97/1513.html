&lt;It may yet be discovered that consciousness isn't just a wonderfully<br>
evolved network of chemically activated neuron firings but a<br>
self-contained spectrum of energy utilizing the biology of the brain. <br>
An energy domain existing above/beyond the spectrum of light (a domain<br>
on which we are no doubt still getting volumes of new information).&gt;<br>
<p>
Most of us harbor ‘hopes’ of dimensions ‘above and beyond’ the<br>
physical world.  For example, there is the computationalist vision of<br>
the universe as a giant computer program, running on some higher (or<br>
‘lower’ ?) dimensions’ ‘hardware’, that we can eventually decode and<br>
treat as software such that we could ultimately gain access to the<br>
privileged levels of the operating system, maintain our selves as<br>
immortals at some virtual reality level, and pop in and out of<br>
physical reality whenever and whereever we like.  This is what we<br>
sometimes call ‘transcension’. <br>
<p>
Also, for those on Extropians not aware of it, a recent Transhumans’<br>
thread ("What will you be doing in 3000?") has discussed the notion of<br>
hyperspherical, nested universes; e.g., on Tue, 3 Jun 1997, Mathew<br>
Korica wrote: <br>
&lt;..."jumping" to a  higher or lower hypersphere (ie. energy level) (if<br>
the nested universe theory is correct. In order to do this we may have<br>
to compact ourselves into diffusable components.&gt;<br>
As Anders responded, Iain Banks’ latest novel, _Excession_, paints<br>
some promising pictures of this.<br>
<p>
A while back (5/16?), I responded to one of Rick Knight’s early posts,<br>
disparaging Fred Alan Wolf’s book _The Spiritual Universe_, appearing<br>
to be critical of _any_ such notions of the soul and spirit.  Let me<br>
try to clarify what I found most appalling in Wolf’s theory, as well<br>
as in most "New Age"  speculation:<br>
<p>
First, most of these theories fail to distinguish between a<br>
dis-incarnate mind that, supposedly, could exist without any physical<br>
embodiment *at all* (the spiritualist position), and a distributed<br>
mind that, somehow, exists at a level beyond normal constraints of<br>
space-time (if above, ‘transcended’, if below, ‘sublimed’) and makes<br>
use of selected physical substrates, that may be non-locally<br>
connected, utilizing some sort of broad- (or narrow-) casting<br>
technique, to maintain itself (the &gt;computationalist position).<br>
<p>
What I found most ‘appalling’ about Wolf’s notion of a ‘spiritual<br>
universe’ was its entropian tendency to regress back to the void,<br>
rather than onward into higher and higher levels of complexity.  Part<br>
of Wolf’s thesis states: <br>
&lt;... we will see the soul as a process involving consciousness of<br>
knowledge. This process occurs in the vacuum of space in the presence<br>
and absence of both matter and energy ... The major activity of the<br>
soul is manifestation of matter and energy and the shaping of the<br>
material world by knowledge.&gt;<br>
<p>
Frankly, this sounds like shoddy, wishful thinking to me: Knowledge is<br>
the ability to rationally (and intuitively) store and manipulate<br>
symbolic representations of reality. It can only grow or be<br>
constructed through material interactions.  At the level of vacuum,<br>
unorganized matter and energy, there is yet no knowledge, only<br>
fundamental ‘urges’ or forces.<br>
<p>
Wolf concludes:<br>
&lt;I will show that all of these nearly countless separately conscious<br>
souls are illusions, reflections of one soul with singular<br>
consciousness lasting throughout the span of time our universe<br>
persists.&gt;<br>
<p>
Well, that may be true from a certain warped perspective, but it is<br>
also an illusion, a worse one, because it leads only to a void of<br>
"limitless potential" which would never be actualized but for the<br>
individual material instantiations.<br>
<p>
Wolf adds:<br>
&lt;Based on my research, the spirit appears to be virtual vibrations of<br>
vacuum energy, the soul turns out to be reflections of those virtual<br>
vibrations in time, and the self is an illusion arising from<br>
reflections of the soul in matter.&gt;<br>
<p>
So, matter is an illusion, just because it is impermanent, and we are<br>
to believe that potentials can exist independently of the population<br>
of actuals from which they arise.  It is this type of vacuous,<br>
post-modernist thinking that I want to avoid when speculating about<br>
possibilities for transcension (or sublimation).<br>
<p>
Leaving Fred Wolf aside, F.David Peat's 1987 book _Synchronicity_<br>
attempted to popularize physicist David Bohm's ideas about a<br>
holographic mind and universe, emphasizing that Bohm's theory of the<br>
implicate order is a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics<br>
because it postulates a quantum potential connecting all things. Peat<br>
proposed that awareness is a sort of "guide wave", encompassing the<br>
whole distributed memory of the universe, while attention is the<br>
localized retrieval mechanism. The guide wave works on the principle<br>
that information encoded in a small amount of energy has the potential<br>
to guide much more energetic objects, just like 'immaterial' radar<br>
signals can guide a materially huge ship at sea.<br>
<p>
Even if this is so (guide wave encompassing the whole distributed<br>
memory of the universe), it is still a code that is just an unrealized<br>
potential until it ‘finds’ materials and organisms through which it<br>
can be executed.<br>
<p>
In ch.7 of _Synchronicity_ Peat gets distracted by mystical notions<br>
about "the implicit ground which is sustained by the eternal spring<br>
which bubbles up from the unnamed source of creativity." (Arghh!) I<br>
contend that, because this energy "pervades all of existence", any<br>
attempt to focus on it is fairly meaningless. As Peat admits, "the<br>
actual generative power ... lies behind the various manifestations of<br>
the world." Thus, it is only by 'programming' within the bounds of<br>
this universe that we have any hope of tapping into this evolving<br>
energy base. Mystical experiences are a dime a dozen - they come and<br>
go - and are just as ‘illusory’ as time-stamped rational judgments!<br>
The zen master knows that the Unlimited Potential evaporates into a<br>
fog when we try to focus on it. In other words, as a distinct concept<br>
or captured state, it has no meaning! The 'Vacuum State' is just that<br>
- it has meaning only when combined with the 'Plenum'. Peat's<br>
neurosis, and that of other mystics, is to be always searching for<br>
some 'underlying' Godhead when, as his own arguments show, such a<br>
thing is meaningless but for its manifestations in the material<br>
universe; or, as Peat admits, "the animating power of the world arises<br>
within movement of dualities."<br>
<p>
Also, in ch.4 of _Infinity and the Mind_ Rudy Rucker concluded that<br>
consciousness was simply existence in an environment ("I am") and<br>
that, therefore, everything is conscious. I don't think it's quite<br>
that simple: Consciousness is the interplay between awareness, or<br>
perception, attention and intention. Therefore, only complex<br>
self-adaptive systems capable of creating semantic models and taking<br>
action on them can exhibit consciousness. Mere stimulus and response,<br>
just bobbing without judgment on the waves of some cosmic ocean of<br>
being, is not consciousness as we know it.<br>
<p>
I think neither matter nor mind is primary in nature; rather, each<br>
serves as a context for the other's development.<br>

P.S. Here’s a few appropriate snips from Iain Banks, _The Excession_ :)<br>
<p>
[The drone is trying to escape the Excession’s clutches: ] "... a<br>
skein wave passed around and through it; a sharp, purposeful ripple in<br>
space-time ... But this wave was compressed, tightly folded; not the<br>
massive, swell-long surge created when a star contracted into a black<br>
hole ... It was a signal. Or, it was part of a sense." (~p90-100)<br>
<p>
Eccentric /Shoot Them Later/ on tight beam, M32, to GSV /Anticipation<br>
of a New Lover's Arrival, The/ [trying to coverup a suspected<br>
conspiracy]: "my dear friend ... spend more time enjoying yourself ...<br>
simulations, abstractions, projections; these are only themselves, not<br>
the reality of what they claim to represent. Attend to the actuality<br>
of events ... What is there to fear but the wild imaginings which may<br>
well be the result of looking too far beyond the scale of relevance<br>
.. I think it is this constant urge to inquire that causes you such<br>
pain; when one is able to scrutinize a subject as closely as we are -<br>
and to do so with the cross-referential capacity we possess, then the<br>
closer one looks into anything the more coincidences one finds,<br>
perfectly innocent though they may be." (~p100-150)<br>
