<p>
No we don't.  Even the "The Blabber" is in the same universe "Ravna"<br>
could easily be a descendant of the original population with the same<br>
name.  The name of the founding mother might well be popular.  And at<br>
any rate, I've generally figured that the short story was a prototype<br>
for the universe, and shouldn't be shoehorned in.  I've tried, and it<br>
doesn't fit very well.<br>

More like _Ringworld Engineers_; a small fraction die to save the whole.<br>
But the whole is so big the death of the fraction beggars the<br>
imagination.  Unchecked the Blight might well have spread around the<br>
galaxy to consume the whole High Beyond and Low Transcend (since it<br>
seemed fairly good at killing off Powers) and who knows what after that.<br>

Perhaps.  My take on the book, and the Skroderider legends, has been<br>
that the natural state of the universe corresponds to what I'll call the<br>
High Transcend, and that the entire system of the Zones is an artifact,<br>
partly to deal with the Blight, and partly to make sure that budding<br>
civlizations were protected in the future.  Beyond and Slow Zone as<br>
nurseries.  This exaplains why the Blight was so good at murdering<br>
Powers -- its previous incarnation had been in the High Transcend, so<br>
while the current one wasn't running at full capacity it had access to<br>
algorithms and whatnot that the Low Powers didn't, in much the same way<br>
that skrodes couldn't be designed, tinkered with, or understood, by<br>
Beyond intelligences.<br>
<p>
I had the impression, from one brief mention of Andromeda(?) that the<br>
Zonal pattern was in other galaxies as well, which would help the belief<br>
that it was natural.  So 5 billion years ago Powers arose, one or more<br>
were nasty (the Blight may have extended through much of the universe<br>
then -- Straumli activated one of many dormant copies -- and the High <br>
EPA zonked it and then set up a general protection scheme.<br>
<p>
Why they made the Unthinking Depths, I don't know.  <br>
<p>
A scenario where they simply exploited and expanded the natural<br>
structure of the universe is equally compatible with the evidence, but I<br>
think mine is more space operatic. :)<br>

} was pushed out beyond the Transcend, it would need to shrink more like<br>
} 10,000 ly to be back to where it is today, requiring 5 billion years.<br>
} But this is much longer than their history seems to go back.  Possibly the<br>
<p>
} case the previous incarnation of the Blight might have happened only a<br>
} billion or two years ago.<br>
<p>
Reliable (?) history may go back 1 gigayear; I don't remember.  But they<br>
have at least traces to 5 gigayears I think, and specifically the<br>
Skroderiders are said to be 5 gigayears old.  So the shrinkage rate<br>
numbers, which I did check once, match the history if the rate has been<br>
constant.  Your first answer was right.<br>
