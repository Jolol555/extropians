What does it take to produce productive work towards life extension <br>
and well being?<br>
<p>
A belief that it is possible<br>
A belief that it is a good thing<br>
A belief that you are capable of it<br>
A belief that it is a better thing to do than the alternatives <br>
(for people with high need for achievement scores)<br>
A decision to do it<br>
Knowledge and skills<br>
Actual possibility and capability<br>
<p>
(Skim)<br>
If significant life extension is not possible it may still be <br>
rewarding, but does not stand out from the many other things <br>
one might do.  Possibility is a key issue but is best approached <br>
with an open mind which I think is more likely once the value of <br>
longevity is established.  Therefore the first question to tackle <br>
is whether longevity is a good or bad thing.<br>
<p>
(Skim)<br>
My own thinking on meta-ethics suggest that values are an evolved <br>
phenomenon.  They come about as a result of genetic tendencies, <br>
cultural influences and personal experiences but have no inherent <br>
validity.  There may be an inevitable direction to which ethics <br>
are heading but that involves a discussion of fatalism and the <br>
fate of the universe which I do not think is required at this time.<br>
<p>
My point is that I think longevity may be a really good thing and <br>
will move on to considering whether or not it is indeed good given <br>
my own values (which you will hopefully find comfortably familiar). <br>
I will follow that (when I can) by a discussion of common values <br>
and how to argue to those values (ethics).<br>
<p>
(Skim)<br>
I will make the argument to my own values short.  I think it’s <br>
really cool.  I like an awful lot of things.  I am having a lot <br>
of fun in life and there are a ton of things to do.  I think the <br>
future is going to be pretty bright and look forward to <br>
participating in it.  I can’t see how my survival will doom <br>
humanity so I don’t even need to weight the relative value of <br>
my survival and theirs.  I could conceivably be wrong and the <br>
future may be very grim indeed, but I doubt I will be forced <br>
to stay alive in such a world.<br>
<p>
Okay, there is all the justification I need.  My argument hinges <br>
primarily on the prospect of a worthwhile future and my <br>
observation that I find life good now.  <br>
<p>
Now what I want is a relatively sound set of arguments and <br>
techniques that convince other people that my longevity is good <br>
or at least neutral and their longevity is also (thus generating <br>
customers and co-workers while simultaneously being a very helpful <br>
fellow).  I also want to see how hard it is  to convince people <br>
of the value of longevity before moving on to possibility.  <br>
<p>
My first quest is to identify people’s values and the relative <br>
importance of their various values to them.  Values vary by <br>
culture and from one individual to another but what sort of <br>
value groups relevant to longevity can I identify?<br>
<p>
(Skim)<br>
<i>&gt;From Paul Churchland’s  _Engine of Reason, Seat of the Soul_ I </i><br>
learned that brains function as neural nets doing vector <br>
calculations.  From a psychology book (Zimbardo and Gerrig) I <br>
learned, recalled, or inferred the following, people have states <br>
or modes,  behavior habitually falls short of expressed morals, <br>
prior beliefs influence perceptions, thinking is a conditioned <br>
behavior, optimism is a good habit, situations have a big <br>
influence on behavior, belief that a therapist can help is a <br>
prime requisite for good therapy, and many people follow the <br>
group and/or authority figure.<br>
<p>
I think I would be best to return to my study of marketing <br>
and sales at this point but I would like hear some ideas.  <br>
<p>
What are the common values about longevity and how do people <br>
group based on their thinking about life extension?  <br>
<p>
What are the most persuasive ethical arguments that can be <br>
made in favor of longevity keeping values in mind?  <br>
<p>
What sorts of  people would be easiest to convince?  <br>
What sorts of people would be most rewarding to convince?  <br>
What are some signs that a give person is beyond practical <br>
help for the time being?<br>
<p>
