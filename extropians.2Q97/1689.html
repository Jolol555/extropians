	No.  Abstract representation, though behaviorally similar is<br>
nothing like the phenomenal representations and feelings we use to<br>
represent information.  Currently color detecting machines can tell us<br>
what color things are many times better than we can.  But what the<br>
machine uses to represent this color knowledge is nothing like the<br>
phenomenal, or spiritual if you will, stuff we use to represent color.<br>
<p>
	A simple abstract representation of us may behave the same but<br>
when we ask the abstract simulation what the color blue is like it's<br>
abstract representations of what we would try to say to describe blue<br>
would simply lie since it would only represent information abstractly<br>
and it wouldn't have anything to do with the phenomenal sensations we<br>
represent such information with.<br>
<p>
	In order to upload ourselves we must do more than abstractly<br>
represent such sensations.  We must learn how to accurately reproduce<br>
the precise sensations and feelings we now use to represent our<br>
conscious knowledge, not just do it with abstract structures.  I want<br>
red to be much more than a certain pattern of abstract bits in my<br>
future uploaded self.  Abstraction isn't enough!  We must have<br>
identical phenomenal representations.<br>
