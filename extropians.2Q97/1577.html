<p>
Open question, but, as I said, probably not.  Monkeys have evolved to<br>
reproduce successfully in the wild for millions of years (billions in some<br>
senses) and this has left them with many behaviors not well suited to<br>
domesticated society.  AIs will not start with this disadvantage.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Long domestication tends to make animals more docile (e.g. dogs vs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;wolves) and AIs will presumably start out docile, from both design</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;goals and (presumably) little need for self-motivation in the early</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;stages.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think you're arguing that docility is irrelevant to increasing</i><br>

<p>
I would think that some self-motivation is important to intelligence.  But<br>
even the most docile domesticated animal is pretty self-motivated.  Docility<br>
is comparative.<br>
<p>
As an aside, the domesticated primate (us) is the smartest primate of all.<br>
 Domesticated animals by contrast tend to be dumber than their wild<br>
relatives.  Apparently we prefer assistants as dumb as practical; this<br>
preference may carry over to AIs.  The highly limited idiot savant-type AI<br>
might well be the kind humans prefer to have about.  Of course, we want AIs<br>
for thinking, while animals we generally want for other purposes.<br>
