Tony, please note that I did *not* say that certain things could not be<br>
discussed. I said that certain things could not be discussed *on this<br>
list*. Without having some rules for our private community, chaos will<br>
reign. That doesn't mean I want to set rules for anyone else's private<br>
community.<br>
<p>
What's the big deal about putting this discussion on another list? You can<br>
even send a message here pointing interested parties to that discussion.<br>
<p>
We've done remarkably well without moderation. Let's try to keep it that way.<br>
