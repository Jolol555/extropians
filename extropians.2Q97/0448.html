<i>&gt; &gt; Prizes can be an excellent mechanism.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This thread started with Robert Anton Wilson's excellent idea in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Schrodinger's Cat.</i><br>
<p>
The idea is much older than that: prizes for invention predate<br>
the relatively recent idea of patents by centuries, and have<br>
much to recommend them over the present approach.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I see no reason why it cannot work. I just find it sad that the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; incentive in today's world is money, and not pride, or fame, or the </i><br>
<i>&gt; pure thrill of success, or the feeling of achievement gained when you see</i><br>
<i>&gt; a private fantasy tuen into a reality.</i><br>
<p>
All of those things--pride, achievement, thrill--are income, and no<br>
different than any other form of income.  What each person desires,<br>
and what efforts he is willing to put in to obtain them, is a<br>
personal matter, different for each person on the planet.  "Money"<br>
is a wonderful invention that allows different people to compare<br>
their desires more accurately and facilitate exchange.  It is only<br>
a mechanism, not the end goal.  But since everyone wants different<br>
things, if I want to give someone a prize for a certain task, money<br>
makes it possible for me to offer something of value to more people.<br>
If I offerred my labor, some may not want it.  If I offered fame,<br>
some won't care.  But if I offer money--interchangeable for all of<br>
those things--then everyone can participate, and use the money to<br>
buy what /he/ wants instead of what I might want to give him.<br>
<p>
Someone might very well prefer the feeling of accomplishment at a<br>
job well done, but that's his business, not mine; and there's no<br>
reason he can't have that /and/ the money.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Nobody believes in their dreams any more, only if they get rewarded</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the surrogate american dream of MONEY MONEY MONEY!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is a sad state of affairs.</i><br>
<p>
A meaningless tirade that people use to excuse the fact that they<br>
don't feel like doing what's necessary to achieve their goals, or<br>
by those whose goals aren't imaginitive enough.  It would indeed be<br>
irrational to seek green squares of paper for their own sake; but<br>
any person with goals, who wants to interact with others freely to<br>
achieve those goals, would find those pieces of paper to be his<br>
handiest tool.  Seeking money is a sign that you have goals, and<br>
are willing to work for them.  Nothing could be more anti-life,<br>
anti-progress, anti-human than to not value money.<br>
