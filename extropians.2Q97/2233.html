Well, don't jump *too* hard on RAW.  He's an an entertaining read, good at<br>
poking holes in silly conceits, and an eloquent advocate for open-mindedness.<br>
 As you point out, he is indeed an object example that it's possible to be<br>
*too* open-minded.<br>
<p>
One interesting thing about RAW is that sometimes, his positions are jokes,<br>
and he doesn't really mean them.  Apparently this is part of a "question<br>
authority and think for yourself message."  I sure hope that's the case with<br>
his support of Velikovsky.<br>
