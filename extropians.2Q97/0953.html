<i>&gt; From: "Michael M. Butler" &lt;butler@comp-lib.org&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I suggest either the paid subscription (or variant) or the institution of</i><br>
a policy that topics like free-market vs (x) *must* be discussed purely in<br>
E-Prime--violators to be banished, no warning, no exceptions.<br>
<i>&gt; Harsh, but effective.</i><br>
	But not honest, as in honoring the other.  We appreciated Max dropping a<br>
note now and again when we stepped on toes.  <br>
	Why have so many on this list spent so many lines on this...a subject they<br>
do not wish to debate?  Where did the compulsion come from?  <br>
	If this is not the list to discuss such things as the marriage of Jesus,<br>
how to raise teenagers, or when is the best time to put out ones geraniums,<br>
then don't discuss those things.  If we don't debate free-market vs<br>
control, then don't give it a single line and watch how fast the poster<br>
either moves on or discusses that which we have all decided on.  Try it,<br>
you'll like it!      ard<br>
