<i>&gt; In recent mailings there has been talk of "changing the system from within"</i><br>

<i>&gt; that this won't work, because (true) Extropians are such an incredibely</i><br>
<i>&gt; small</i><br>
<i>&gt; minority. </i><br>
<p>
Yet the meme is infectious.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; In fact if Extropy were some suicidal CULT it would have more</i><br>
<i>&gt; "followers"</i><br>
<i>&gt; than it has now.</i><br>
<p>
Suicide doesn't quite swell the ranks. :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Our "enemies" are not just the politicians and business</i><br>
<i>&gt; conglomerates and their henchmen who rule the present "system", but also</i><br>
<i>&gt; "the people" themselves. They are the ones who really hold the system up,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and prevent important social/political/ economical/technological change.</i><br>
<p>
The "people" are you and I as well. My point is that, given the best of<br>
information, the "people" will generally choose to better themselves.<br>
The problem then becomes giving the people the best of information.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The reasons for this are of course a childish fear of "the unknown", an</i><br>
<i>&gt; aversion to personal responsibility, pure laziness, stupidity and related</i><br>
<i>&gt; negative characteristics. Indeed, most people prefer to huddle up</i><br>
<i>&gt; under the ubusive wings of Big Brother, pretending to be safe, rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; to boldly and independently surge forwards in life, always looking for</i><br>
<i>&gt; improvement.</i><br>
<p>
This is a common view and, in my opinion, untrue. People do not "huddle"<br>
with Big Brother. Indeed, it is Big Brother who "corrals" them into<br>
finite areas bounded by law. People are, in my opinion, by nature<br>
self-aggrandizing animals. Fear may have once been the reason for the<br>
social contract. However the only things "unknown" these days are of<br>
concern to the most expert of scientists. Indeed, it is arrogant to<br>
underestimate the collective intelligence of the human race -- or at the<br>
very least the democratic electorate.  People are smarter together than<br>
by themselves -- once again, if they have the best of information.   <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Therefore, any attempt to change the system from within is certain to fail,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; progressive Extropian ideas simply lack a broad popular support.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Consequently, Extropian politicians would be a small minority and thus an</i><br>
<i>&gt; easy target for their less enlightened colleagues. Their progressive</i><br>
<i>&gt; proposals would either be badly</i><br>
<i>&gt; compromized, or be ignored/defeated.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Watered-down policy is the essence of Madisonian political architecture.<br>
I would expect nothing less than a half-baked attempt at deregulation of<br>
key industries.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; What are the alternatives then; doing nothing?  No, this would definately</i><br>
<i>&gt; be very</i><br>
<i>&gt; un-Extropian. </i><br>
<p>

miles." -- Lao Tse<br>

<i>&gt; Any "tough" future colonists (the real Extropians) out there?</i><br>
<p>
I appreciate your vision.<br>
