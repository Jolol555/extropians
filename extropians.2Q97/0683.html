        <br>

Sometimes yes but not in general. When an excited mercury atom returns to its <br>
ground state it emits 2 photons, the two are forever linked even if they are <br>
on the other side of the universe, you can make a destructive measurement on <br>
one and it will tell you what the measurement of the   correlated, still<br>
existing photon must be. This sort of thing was done by Clauser and Aspect in <br>
their experiments on Bell's inequality that proved it  was violated.<br>
         <br>

<p>
It's not just spin that's digital, so is the quantity of electric charge,  <br>
and the type of electric charge (2), and baryon number, and electron family <br>
number, and muon family number, and magnetic moment, and parity, and the <br>
number (6) of different types of quarks, and the number (3) of "color" <br>
charges that quarks come in. <br>
<p>
Even polarization is digital, sort of. Pick a direction at random, and for  <br>
any photon of unknown polarization there are only 2 choices, it must be <br>
polarized in that direction or at right angles to it. If it makes it through  <br>
your polarization filter, it could make it through a thousand set in the  <br>
same direction, and so could any twin photon correlated with it. If it  <br>
doesn't make it through then the photon was polarized at right angles to the  <br>
polarization filter, as can be proven by the correlated photon.  <br>

<i>        &gt;To the best of our knowledge, muon is an elementary particle. It         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;decays into an electron and two neutrinos.</i><br>
           <br>
<p>
If it decays into something lighter and more stable then it can't be  <br>
very elementary.<br>
           <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If what you are saying were true, momentum of the electron in the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;rest frame of the parent muon would be quantized, meaning it could         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;only have values from a discrete set, and the spacing between the         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;possible values would be some constant.  This is not observed.  </i><br>
                    <br>
<p>
I see your point and it's a very good one. The energy (and thus the momentum  <br>
too) of the electron is indeed random and limited to the range from zero to <br>
52 MeV. It's interesting that the range of energy of something like an alpha <br>
particle given off by a nucleus in not continuous, because it's the only <br>
particle given off in the decay reaction. When the muon decays on the other <br>
hand, 3 particles are created and the electron must share the energy with the <br>
other 2 particles in an arbitrary ratio. I'll just have to find comfort in <br>
the fact that the total momentum in the rest frame is quantized, to zero in <br>
this case. :&gt;)<br>
           <br>
I could eliminate all my problems with energy and momentum if I could invoke <br>
digital space and time, in a way that would be a cheat but in another way it <br>
wouldn't be. Today's Physics can tell us nothing about what happens when time <br>
gets smaller than The Plank Time of 5.4 * 10^-44 second or distance gets <br>
smaller than The Plank Length of 10^-33 cm, photons of that wavelength are so <br>
small and have so much energy that they become Black Holes, and  Black Holes <br>
contain a singularity. We had no choice, we've already made a defacto <br>
quantization of space-time. However, I admit I'm not comfortable using this <br>
dodge, because at these very small distances Quantum Mechanics and General<br>
Relativity and not compatible, so obviously the last word has not been spoken. <br>
We need a quantum theory of gravity before we can know for sure.                                  <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;The point is that c and h are more fundamental than meter or second.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Yes, but not more fundamental than space or time.               <br>
                 <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;don't forget that all these weirdnesses are problems of</i><br>
<i>        &gt;interpretation, not of quantum mechanics itself. </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
I disagree, an interpretation is part of any theory, quantum mechanics has <br>
several, all weird.   <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;QM works.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
I agree, in fact I would say that no theory in the history of Science has <br>
been more successful than Quantum Mechanics. It works, it's true, it's crazy. <br>
