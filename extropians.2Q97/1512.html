I don't think I was ever "taught" critical thinking or reasoning. I<br>
somehow "just got it". Of course, both of my parents were heavy handed<br>
critical reasoners of one sort or another (my father more<br>
mathematically oriented, my mother better at public speaking sorts of<br>
things).<br>
<p>
The most important thing, I think, is the fundamental lesson that you<br>
CAN reason things out. All else is just learning tricks for doing<br>
it. The point in "Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman" where people<br>
expressed surprise to the young Richard Feynman that he would<br>
successfully fix appliances after "thinking about them". Most people<br>
don't *try* to think things out when confronted with a novel problem<br>
-- they just flail. The very idea of using a systematic approach is<br>
crucial.<br>
<p>
The biggest lesson is simply "try to think how what you are concerned<br>
about works and then think about what the results of your actions will<br>
be". Thats the cornerstone of all problem solving -- the seed from<br>
which it springs. Unless you have the systematic/thinking approach in<br>
mind to begin with, the very idea that there might be tools like logic<br>
to help you in your thinking never even comes up.<br>
<p>
I don't know if this can be taught, or if it can be taught, if it can<br>
be taught past the age of three.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From there, there appears to be a second big leap -- the leap to</i><br>
understanding abstractions. By this, I mean the ability to do<br>
"empirical" thinking -- to note that certain patterns are repeated in<br>
different realms and abstract them out into general rules. Some people<br>
"get" abstractions, and "get" the idea of modeling a system in terms<br>
of them, and some people don't. I don't know if this can be taught,<br>
either, or if it is just something you learn when you are very, very<br>
young.<br>
<p>
I've noticed, btw, that neither of these "core skills" seems to be<br>
correlated with social station in an absolute way. I've met lawyers<br>
who *could not reason*, and stone masons who were fine at inventing<br>
solutions to problems on the fly.<br>
