We are a community, and this community has different aspects.  We are<br>
a social group, in that we share a history of socializing together and<br>
knowing each other.  And we are a community of commonality: In some<br>
way we are people who share certain values.  In other ways we are<br>
likely people who share certain beliefs.  And we share common<br>
interests in what sorts of new developments elsewhere we'd like to<br>
hear about. <br>
<p>
But in part at least, we are also a research community.  And as such a<br>
community we must share some core open research questions.  These are<br>
questions where we not only want to keep each other abreast of<br>
research done elsewhere, but where our interests and abilities are so<br>
strong that we consider contributing to such research ourselves.  And<br>
where we would likely turn to each other first for criticism and<br>
comments on this research.<br>
<p>
I think it would help if we could just collect a list of suggested<br>
research questions.  Then we could talk about which we think are more<br>
interesting and important, so we could create a common impression of<br>
our core questions.  Knowing that our community knows it is interested<br>
in these questions would help inspire people like me to actually go<br>
research those questions.<br>
<p>
Here are some that come to mind, biased of course to my interests:<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------<br>
What does the Great Silence tell us about our future chances for expansion?<br>
<p>
How does the brain encode long-term information in neurons?  What<br>
devices could read this information with enough accuracy for uploading?<br>
<p>
What would be the labor and population economics of a post-upload<br>
world, or a post AI world?<br>
<p>
What are the primary causes of economic growth, and how will upcoming<br>
technologies such as nanotech, AI, uploads, WWW, affect growth rates?<br>
<p>
What new tech transitions pose the most risk for sudden destabilizing<br>
changes?  How could we best avoid such problems?<br>
<p>
How strongly does/will evolutionary pressures change values, and in<br>
what direction?  How plastic are our values now?<br>
<p>
Why are we such a minority?  Is it our values or beliefs or<br>
intelligence, or what?  If our beliefs, we can't we persuade others,<br>
and how sure are we that we're not wrong?<br>
<p>
Would new institutions, such as fact forums, hypertext debate, or idea<br>
futures help much to persuade others?<br>
<p>
How can a cryonics organization remain stable for as long as required?<br>
<p>
What are the real limiting factors to large scale space colonization?<br>
E.g., how cheap a launch to get to support energy or mining colonies?<br>
<p>
What are the real limiting factors to large-scale crypto?  Do we want it?<br>
<p>
What core "constitutional" contract would best support the widest<br>
freedom in private law and elsewhere for a long time?<br>
<p>
What would be good private law contracts to consider to deal with:<br>
defense, scale economies, privacy, slavery, marriage, intellectual<br>
property, restitution, pollution, children's rights, etc.?<br>
<p>
What now limits freedom?  People's perceptions of how much freedom<br>
they want, or structural failings of our forms of government?<br>
<p>
What are the prospects for getting more freedom via intentional<br>
physical communities vs. cyberspace vs. political advocacy?<br>
<p>
How should one best define property rights in near solar space?<br>
Can these be profitably sold before "mixing labor with land"?<br>
<p>
