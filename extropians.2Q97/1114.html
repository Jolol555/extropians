The control of the various enzymes for glycogen synthesis and breakdown, for<br>
fat synthesis and breakdown, and for glucose production are part of one of<br>
these typically complicated feedback systems.  Most of this stuff takes place<br>
in the liver and that's what I meant by "decides".  Glycogen stores don't<br>
have a strict maximum, it's just that the more of it there is, the more the<br>
enzymes tend to break it down and the less they tend to make it.<br>

<p>
This is basically what's going on, except that I've never seen any indication<br>
that the liver cares all that much about the type of food coming in.  The<br>
liver is very good at interconverting the 3 forms (protein, carbohydrate, and<br>
fat) and normally interconverts all of them all of the time.  The associated<br>
energy loss is apparently negligeable.<br>
