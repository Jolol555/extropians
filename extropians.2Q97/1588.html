What we have here is burgeoning awareness that "self and other" *may* be as big a fantasy as "soul and meat". Dualisms are funny things.<br>
<p>
<p>
A great deal depends on how you look at it.<br>
<p>
<p>
Where does "I" end and "it" begin? Where does "I" end and "you" begin?<br>
<p>
What was your face before you were born? Show me.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; This sounds no different to me from the Christian Apocalypse &amp;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Resurrection.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
As G. Spencer Brown said, the symbol = may be taken to mean "is confused with".  Maybe we should use that incisive brain to look harder at the individual pieces of the proposition, rather than adopting an all-or-none approach. Then again, maybe not, what do I know? :)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;e're supposed to regress back into the womb, the void,</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; from everything back to nothing, renouncing our worldly 'sins'! Isn't</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; that wonderful?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Maybe. How different, really, is that notion from the Big Crunch? If you believe you can outlast that, we're talking metaphysics anyway; hunker down, have some vittles and we'll jaw. :)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;Not very wonderful at all, really. I'm still not sure of the full</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;implications of my theory above, but I certainly hope that it doesn't mean</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;that there's only one consciousness in the universe. That sounds pretty</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;dull to me. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Mebbe. You can always play "let's pretend there's me and you"--which is a philosophy with a long and motley heritage.<br>
<p>
<p>
BTW, FWIW, I'm dead serious about everything. All hail Eris--or don't.<br>
