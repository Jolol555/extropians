Yeah. I happen to know Hans Thulin (sp?), a Swede who was the first<br>
Swedish real estate billionaire. Seems the Swedish IRS came up with a<br>
tax bill that was 110% of his income and assets, so he skipped the<br>
country with a couple of suitcases of dough and offshore bank accounts.<br>
He moved to Seattle where he bought out the West Coast Hotel Chain and<br>
grew it from less than 15 hotels up to over 50 in a span of less than 5<br>
years. Eventually, the INS was ordered to extradite him back to Sweden<br>
to face his "crimes", but he found out about the order early and caught<br>
a flight elsewhere. The last time I talked to him was when he called a<br>
freind of mine and I from his yatch off Argentina, 2 years ago. He now<br>
hardly ever goes within national waters. He sends a launch with crew<br>
ashore to provision and ferry fuel when needed.<br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think you're right when emphasizing on *structure* and not money.</i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, if you take the money you spend on an apartment and</i><br>
<i>&gt; your office (and add the none-tax bonus), you'll probably get a decent</i><br>
<i>&gt; hotel room where you can sleep and work.</i><br>
<p>
The problem is getting work. How many jobs are there that you can do<br>
from a laptop anywhere?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Which brings me to an aside. Why do we need, as Extropians who embrace</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Intelligent Technology, a physical presence anywhere today?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The family still is and will continue to be important. But still,</i><br>
<i>&gt; its not an obstacle for the PT. Event if you travel a lot, you'll</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably want to return "home" once in a while.</i><br>
