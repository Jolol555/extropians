I don't know how literally you mean "bordering on creationism" but if it's<br>
literally true you're probably wasting your time.  Anybody believing in<br>
creationism is following emotional or social needs while ignoring<br>
overwhelming evidence in matters biological.  If so, even the most pithy or<br>
telling arguments will be ignored.  <br>
<p>
Anyway, on defying evolution: We already do.  I'd have died of pneumonia at<br>
age 3 if we didn't defy evolution with antibiotics.<br>
<p>
On playing God: What, is all this hypothetical God able to do is push around<br>
a few DCA molecules?  Pretty wimpy God, I'd say.  I thought God was supposed<br>
to have made the universe, which would be a much more impressive feat.  I<br>
don't see how even completely remaking our entire *galaxy* could even<br>
remotely be considered "playing God".<br>
