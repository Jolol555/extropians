Are you all saying that there is definately no evidence that food combining<br>
has any benefits, in and of, its own rights (the combining part, not the food<br>
content)?  I have never studied it that much, but I have friends that try to<br>
follow it.  Is there simply a lack of evidence supporting it, or is there<br>
actually evidence contrary to it?  Just wondering.  Personally, I take plant<br>
enzymes with my meals, and it aids digestion quite well.  In fact, even if<br>
food combining did have any merits, I think enzymes would make food combing<br>
obsolete.  I don't mean to get into a discussion, at this time, about<br>
enzymes, I just thougt I'd mention it.  Thanks.<br>
