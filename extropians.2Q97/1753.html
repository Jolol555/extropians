           <br>
<p>
If you stimulate a part of my brain I may indeed have a conscious experience  <br>
of some sort, but the only reason I would have for thinking it was anything  <br>
like the experience you're having is that a theory of consciousness that  <br>
somebody thought up tells me it is. Now I'm sure we will have such theories,  <br>
I'm sure we will have lots and lots of them, but the trouble is unlike <br>
theories of intelligence, consciousness theories are very easy to dream up,  <br>
far, far too easy. These theories have no objective facts they must explain  <br>
so there is no limit to the number of them you can crank out. How could we  <br>
ever know which theory is correct?<br>
<p>
Let's say you have a super sophisticated brain analyzing machine. One day  <br>
you feel sad and analyze your brain with the machine. You develop a <br>
reasonably sounding theory to equate the state of the neurons in your head to <br>
your subjective experience. How do you test your theory? Well, you try it on <br>
me. You notice that the state of my neurons is similar (but not identical) to<br>
yours when you felt sad, and from this you use your theory to conclude that I <br>
am experiencing sadness just like you did. As proof your theory was <br>
successful you point to the fact that I have tears in my eyes and I made a <br>
noise with my mouth that sounded like "I feel sad".<br>
<p>
In any other area this would be sufficient proof that your theory was correct  <br>
but in this one area, for reasons I don't understand, people demand a level <br>
of rigor not seen in any other human endeavor, not even pure mathematics. <br>
A skeptic could correctly point out that the state of my neurons were not<br>
identical to yours only similar, we are after all different people with <br>
different brains. The differences could be crucial, you really felt sad but <br>
it's different with me, I get tear production elevated and the nerves in my <br>
mouth stimulate my tongue to make a noise like " I feel sad" but really  I <br>
feel nothing. The only way to know for sure what it's like to be me is to <br>
turn your brain into an identical copy of mine, but then you wouldn't be you <br>
you'd be me.                                <br>
<p>
Actions are not a perfect instrument for studying consciousness but  it will <br>
just have to do because we will never find anything better. <br>

<p>
I agree with you, although I can't prove it with mathematical certainty I  <br>
think the idea of intelligent zombies is crazy and it's entirely reasonable <br>
to assume that information (memes and genes) is the essence of a person. <br>
I can  give you 4 reasons to support my view, any one of which I find <br>
convincing,  the fact that they all point in the same  direction makes the <br>
case overwhelming, not beyond a shadow of a doubt but certainly beyond a   <br>
reasonable doubt.<br>
<p>
1) The Genetic Code, the blueprint for the body, including the brain, is a <br>
   DIGITAL code, the only difference is that life's digital code uses base 4 <br>
   and most computers use base two. The way ribosome's use this information <br>
   to assemble the building blocks of life (not atoms but a slightly higher <br>
   level object, amino acids) is amazingly computer like. <br>
<p>
2) Nobody has ever seen even a hint of fundamental new physics in the matter <br>
   of the brain, and it uses the same building blocks as non thinking matter. <br>
   The difference must be at a higher level, how the matter is organized and <br>
   there science has found vast differences. To organize anything you need to <br>
   know how to arrange the parts so that you get something that is a <br>
   functioning whole, and all that takes is information.<br>
<p>
3) There is no scientific reason that information processing can't duplicate <br>
   the behavior of an intelligent person, Turing said that 40 years ago. <br>
   I will concede he didn't prove that's the way the brain does it, nor did <br>
   he prove anything about consciousness, but I think it's very probable that <br>
   information processing , if it's complex enough, generates subjectivity. <br>
<p>
4) I don't see how the essence of a person, consciousness, could be an <br>
   unobservable characteristic, because if it was we would never have evolved <br>
   it, thus information processing must be able to duplicate the essence of a <br>
   person. The  Turing test may not perfect but it's the best way we have to <br>
   find consciousness  and we are not likely to find a better one. If the <br>
   Turing test is good for intelligence but not for consciousness that would <br>
   mean that consciousness is not needed for intelligent behavior, so why did <br>
   Evolution ever come up with consciousness in the first place?  Evolution <br>
   is interested in our internal  mental states ONLY if they impact behavior. <br>
   Even if consciousness arose by pure chance (extremely unlikely to say the <br>
   least) most would have lost it by now because of genetic drift, like the <br>
   eyes in fish that have lived in dark caves for millions of years.  <br>
   If Turing is wrong then so is Darwin. <br>
<p>
The only way Turing and Darwin could be wrong is if we posses some inner <br>
non material quality (and not just information) that can not be duplicated by <br>
nanotechnology or even detected by the scientific method, in other words if <br>
we had a soul. If I believed that I would be much more interested in the <br>
mumbo-jumbo of conventional religion than in science.<br>
