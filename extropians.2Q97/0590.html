<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; You are speaking from theory.  In reality, I don't think anyone has yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; shown that a society without compulsion can compete with other societies</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in the real world.</i><br>
---Sniiiiiiiiiiiiiiip---<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;But</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; until they have been proven to work, it's silly to get indignant about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First you might prove to me that your idea of society works.  What's</i><br>
<i>&gt;your chosen example, the US?  Where hundreds of thousands of innocent</i><br>
<i>&gt;men and women are jailed every year, whole cities are impoverished by</i><br>
<i>&gt;inflation of fiat currency and barriers to business entry, twice as much</i><br>
<i>&gt;money is stolen from working families as is necessary for education, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;yet fails miserably to educate them, tens of thousands are killed by</i><br>
<i>&gt;overregulation of medicine, thousands have been sent to kill and die on</i><br>
<i>&gt;foreign soil for political reasons, thousands more have died in secret</i><br>
<i>&gt;medical experiments and state-sactioned murders?  Is their blood just a</i><br>
<i>&gt;theory to you?</i><br>
<p>
Well put.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If it seems silly to you to be indignant about such things, I suggest</i><br>
<i>&gt;that you are simply lucky enough never to have felt the shackles on</i><br>
<i>&gt;your own hands or to have buried good friends.  Utopia might not be</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible, but since I can't run simulations of whole societies to find</i><br>
<i>&gt;out, I must rely on principle and reason.</i><br>
<p>
Hasn't Bart Kosko done some work on simulations of free vs. not-so-free<br>
societies?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Reason tells me that a free</i><br>
<i>&gt;society would work, and would be less likely to commit the atrocities</i><br>
<i>&gt;that every govenment in human history has committed.  It would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;inhuman not to work toward that goal.</i><br>
