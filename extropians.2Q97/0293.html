I just learned that the strong anti-quantitative stance in history<br>
departments in the last two decades is largely a reaction to Fogel's<br>
'74 book "Time on the cross; the economics of American Negro Slavery".<br>
In this book, Fogel argued that his quantitative analysis suggested<br>
that while slavery was bad for the slaves, it was not economically<br>
"inefficient" (in the sense that there was another arrangment that<br>
would have made everyone better off).  In general owners took care of<br>
their property as one would a valuable machine, thought slaves were<br>
worked harder than free men willingly would.  <br>
<p>
This position outraged historians, who called Fogel an ultra<br>
conservative and racist.  This though Fogel was an active member of<br>
the communist party and was named one of the ten most dangerous<br>
intellectuals during the 50s red scare.  Quantitiative analysis has<br>
ever since been a no-no in history departments, who say the<br>
"contingent" nature of history makes numerical comparisons<br>
meaningless.<br>
<p>
Fogel is on the U of Chicago econ faculty, and won the economics Nobel<br>
prize on '93.<br>
