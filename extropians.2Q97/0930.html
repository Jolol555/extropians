<p>
It's even worse then that; the heavy elements accumulated in the lunar core,<br>
but there weren't many heavy elements there in the first place.  Apparently<br>
the Moon originated when something hit the Earth and knocked a big chunk of<br>
it into orbit.  Since the Earth had already separated into core and mantle<br>
at that time, the stuff that got knocked off was all mantle, and consisted<br>
mostly of the boring elements O, Si, Mg and Al.<br>

<i>&gt;We now know more than 2 k objects in orbits</i><br>

<p>
Lots more than that, actually.  To be officially 'numbered', a minor planet<br>
has to have an orbit that is known with sufficient accuracy that we can find<br>
it again when we look any time in the next few decades.  There were 6300<br>
numbered asteroids two years ago; probably by now there are more than 7000<br>
(I can't find recent data).  There are also more than 112,000 observations<br>
of minor planets with too little accuracy to be numbered; typically any<br>
given minor planet accumulates several such preliminary observations before<br>
its orbit is pinned down and it gets a number.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;More than 30 objects have orbits</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the perihelion within Mars orbit. About 20 objects</i><br>
<i>&gt;have their perihelions within the Earth orbit, this are</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Apollo asteroids.</i><br>
<p>
I just counted 27 inside the orbit of earth *now*; those with perihelia<br>
inside earth orbit must be substantially more numerous.  Look at the amazing<br>
and wonderful charts <br>
<p>
<a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/lists/InnerPlot.html">http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/lists/InnerPlot.html</a><br>

to see what's up in our neighborhood.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Asteroids are commonly classified</i><br>
<i>&gt;in Hirayama families by their orbit data; about 40 such</i><br>
<i>&gt;families are known. </i><br>
<p>
90% of asteroids do not belong to any known Hiriyama family.  The families<br>
originate when a body is smashed into smaller pieces by an impact.  The<br>
pieces have similar compositions and pursue similar orbits for a few million<br>
years.  Eventually the orbits drift apart from each other and the family<br>
resemblance is lost.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Additionally, there are the Trojans,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which move in 60 deg distance onto Jupiter orbit, as seen</i><br>
<i>&gt;from the Sun (as predicted by Lagrange).</i><br>
<p>
Probably there are as many bodies in the Trojan clouds as in the main belt,<br>
but since they are further away, less brightly lit, and covered with<br>
(mysterious) coal-black stuff, not as many of them have been observed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;These are but the largest primeval debris pieces, smaller ones</i><br>
<i>&gt;being inaccessible to astronomic observations. </i><br>
<p>
More precisely, nobody wants to pay for the astronomic observations.  An<br>
astronomer with a professional-grade telescope (cost ~$300,000) can find new<br>
asteroids at a rate of one or two a night.  Finding a new asteroid costs<br>
about $1000, and there are thousands available at this cost.  Once these are<br>
found, there are hundreds of thousands available at $5000 each.  Automation<br>
could bring these prices down substantially. <br>
<p>
I'm just making up these costs, but I think they're right to a factor of<br>
two.  Back when I was in grad school, I spent a lot of time studying<br>
asteroids and hanging out with people who looked for them.  It was cool<br>
stuff, but it didn't pay the bills, so I went back to doing computer stuff.<br>
