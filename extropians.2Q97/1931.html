Point noted and appreciated. However I'm not even considering<br>
information that is false. If one knows false information I concede that<br>
this is entirely worthless. But at the same time, if one knows true<br>
information, I'm suggesting that as that kind of information increases,<br>
people will be less risk-averse. The conclusion is that perfect<br>
information about all things (omniscience) leads to perfect behavior.<br>
Risk becomes irrelevant.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and it is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible to know the future with 100% certainty.</i><br>
<p>
You're right. But I'll take 99.9% certainty as good enough.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The main thing that</i><br>
<i>&gt; people seem not to know is how probability and statistics and risk</i><br>
<i>&gt; work, </i><br>
<p>
I think you're saying that the more information people have about such<br>
things, the better they will perform. If so, this is precisely my point. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; and what they most seem to aggrandize is what they will lose on</i><br>
<i>&gt; a given down side.</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure what you're saying here.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Surveys show that many (most?) people are more</i><br>
<i>&gt; afraid of public speaking than of death.</i><br>
<p>
Is public speaking a risk? I think so, in a certain way. Now, I'm not<br>
sure that the only reason people are afraid of public speaking is<br>
risk-aversion. I figure self-confidence (a purely mental construction)<br>
is the primary basis. Indeed, when I get up in court, the more<br>
information I have about the law and the facts of the case, the more I<br>
look forward to my argument. Again, where information increases,<br>
risk-aversion decreases, the more sure of yourself you become.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; A given person can be an optimist in the face of scanty information,</i><br>
<i>&gt; or a pessimist in the face of extensive information.  I think most</i><br>
<i>&gt; people tend towards pessimism, and others towards optimism.</i><br>
<p>
I personally tend towards cynicism. But this only because I'm a stark<br>
optomist. I have such a feeling that mankind is capable of everything<br>
that I can't help a certain arrogance towards the people who are running<br>
our world into the ground. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I tell</i><br>
<i>&gt; some people everything I know about cryonics and they say "What if</i><br>
<i>&gt; it doesn't work?".  My reply:  "Maybe it won't, but then nothing's</i><br>
<i>&gt; changed.  The point is, what if it _does_?".</i><br>
<p>
And that, my extropian friend, is indeed the point.<br>
<p>

Boat drinks (check out Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead for an<br>
explaination of this farewell...),<br>
