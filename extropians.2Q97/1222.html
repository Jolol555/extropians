     Good day to all,<br>
     <br>
     With a recent thread about what to invest in and how "from an <br>
     extropian angle", this begs the question in my mind: Do extropians <br>
     support or indulge the current market economy motif?  I keep <br>
     speculating about how some of the new up and coming industries (such <br>
     as nanotech) might turn the current economic structure inside out.<br>
     <br>
     Not to be too "Jetsons" but as the aforementioned multi-billion <br>
     dollar-funded industry jumps the hurdles it now faces (nano-scale <br>
     physics I believe to be a major area of R&amp;D), we could have material <br>
     goods assembling themselves for cheap and manufacturing (like word <br>
     processing, desktop publishing and studio recording of the last decade <br>
     or two) become something done on a personal scale in our homes.  Some <br>
     of the XPARC brains envision replicating machines like microwave ovens <br>
     or dishwashers now, using carbon-based feedstock in a water-heater <br>
     type container as the building block.  Outlandish?  Any more so than <br>
     how the common citizen of the previous century regarded (if they even <br>
     considered) telecommunications, supersonic flight, laser surgery and <br>
     the like.  And our advancements (when not bogged down by trifling <br>
     concerns of how to outwit competitors and return the largest profit on <br>
     a huge investment) increase much more rapidly as we approach the end <br>
     of this decade/century/millennium.<br>
     <br>
     Biotech is another area where great advancements are being made but <br>
     will it become as belabored and full of misplaced priorities and <br>
     controversy as the pharmaceutical industry?  As long as we are <br>
     cow-towing to the money machine, acting like modern Phoenicians, <br>
     clutching our coins, assigning them meaningful value, equating them <br>
     with survival and success, lying, cheating, stealing and killing for <br>
     them, implicitly and blatantly, how far can we go in the extropian <br>
     sense and how swiftly can we expect to get there?<br>
     <br>
     Must we embrace the notion that people in this culture only do <br>
     something when something is in it for them?  And the "it" is the <br>
     material-bound "stuff" that our culture is completely awash in.  Do <br>
     all the gadgets and distractions of the super warehouse stores and <br>
     mega malls promote cultural/racial harmony, reduce crime, improve <br>
     minds, get us individually involved, change paradigms, innovate beyond <br>
     our dreams?  Or do we just continue to want and hoard?  Do we finally <br>
     get "enough" of the things we want (an ever expanding list thanks to <br>
     the likes of multi-nationals like Sony, Nike, et.al.) and go off in <br>
     our corner and contentedly play (that is, after we've activated our <br>
     home security system to keep out those who would take our toys)?  <br>
     <br>
     People seem to be numbed and immobilized by their possessions.  One <br>
     has to wonder, do we (speaking of all of us not just extropian-minded <br>
     people) just merrily follow the status quo?  Do extropians try to <br>
     wedge their vision into the current socio-economic structure?<br>
     <br>
     True, right now, it takes money to do the things, make the changes we <br>
     envision.  I am not advocating forsaking material wealth and gain.  I <br>
     am advocating that the goal of the post-human would be to restructure <br>
     the current order, not only for self improvement but for the <br>
     improvement of all.  Libertarianism (still not sure how that is <br>
     regarded in the extropian realm), as ideal and utopian as it is <br>
     sometimes painted, could end up being just as noxious, just as futile <br>
     as the material-bound capitalist and communist run systems in the last <br>
     few centuries.  If "investment", meaning capital investment, has the <br>
     result of serving the needs of the many as well as the one, I regard <br>
     that as a good thing.  Self-serving indulgence doesn't seem like a <br>
     post-human endeavor.  If it does, let me know now for I'm here to <br>
     examine whether or not this a group with a creed I can genuinely <br>
     subscribe to.  A post-human, in my estimation, not only pushes the <br>
     envelopes of the technological, physiological and social structure but <br>
     also the structure of self and of ego.  These are components that <br>
     should not be neglected in the evolutionary process.  <br>
     <br>
     Ego is useful but so is gasoline.  It has to be treated with respect, <br>
     used in the right way, carried in the right container, developed in a <br>
     way that limits/eliminates its cumulative toxicity to the environment. <br>
     The metaphor can be easily applied to our seemingly innate tendencies <br>
     to exploit, conquer, usurp and ignore.  Should post-humanism be <br>
     considered complete without including the evolution of emotions.  <br>
     <br>
     One thing I've noticed occasionally turn up in these threads (and <br>
     something that the initial rules disclaimer seeks to limit) is an <br>
     opinionated pomposity, a precursor to name-calling and certainly a <br>
     suppressive element to pro-active and constructive exchange of ideas.  <br>
     I am compelled to ask those so motivated to diminish and deride the <br>
     ideas and opinions of others what their fundamental goal is.  In this <br>
     message, as soapboxy as it may occur for some, I've posed the ideas <br>
     not as altruisms but as questions to be considered.  My participation <br>
     in this is to be a component in improving, recognizing the partness <br>
     and wholeness of everything.  I hope to check ego at the door so as to <br>
     provide the most potency for the exchanges here.  My aim is not to <br>
     provoke or alienate but stimulate and intrigue.  My goal is <br>
     possibility beyond the known, perhaps beyond the dream.  Please <br>
     consider that thoughtfully if you are compelled to reply.  <br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
