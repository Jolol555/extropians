Oliver Richner asked<br>
&lt;DMAE have any known negative side effects?&gt;<br>
<p>
I have seen no references to any negative side effects for DMAE. <br>
 Remember, the result of taking DMAE is to increase the amount of <br>
choline available to the brain AND choline is a natural substance <br>
produced in the brain, so it's not like it's really a drug, it's more <br>
like a 'vitamin supplement' for the brain.<br>
<p>
Most of the questions related to DMAE that I've seen deal with the <br>
question of the proper dose to achieve some noticeable effect.  The <br>
conservative recommendation is 100 mg per day, which is usually the <br>
amount in one capsule.  DMAE is often combined with B vitamins in <br>
prepared capsules.  For stronger effects, I think the recommendation <br>
300 mg per day in three doses.  At this level you might get a <br>
noticeable 'buzz'.<br>
