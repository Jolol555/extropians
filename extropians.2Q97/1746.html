Damien Broderick wrote 6/13/97: &lt;What if human action and discourse track=<br>
 a<br>
kind of Zeitgeist weather cycle, periodic seasons that bias the `spirit o=<br>
f<br>
the<br>
times'?&gt;<br>
<p>
Montesquieu entertainingly dwelt on this question at length in "The Spiri=<br>
t<br>
of Laws" (1748), climate and temperament went hand-in-hand.  The analysis=<br>
<p>
given by Damien seems to be a refinement of an old idea.  In "The History=<br>
<p>
and Geography of Human Genes" by L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi &amp;<br>
Alberto Piazza (1994), pgs. 142-5, the authors find a strong correlation<br>
between human genetic components and absolute temperatures (lending<br>
confirming evidence to Montesquieu's general theory, if not to his specif=<br>
ic<br>
characterizations), and a weaker correlation with humidity.  Only a handf=<br>
ul<br>
of specific genes have strong correlations with climate, a comparatively<br>
slight impact.  The authors are at pains to point out how difficult it is=<br>
<p>
to separate out the effects of climate from historical movements and from=<br>
<p>
the effects of natural selection.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;Between the World Wars, Czech semioticians Jan Mukarovsky and<br>
Roman<br>
Jakobson noticed that the arts of distinct eras seem to be governed by<br>
different `dominants'.&gt;<br>
<p>
I ran across an interesting exercise in the perennial philosophical<br>
exercise of categorization along this line in a work by Alan Gowans calle=<br>
d<br>
"On Parallels in Universal History Discoverable in Arts &amp; Artifacts"<br>
(1972).  Rather than tracking sunspots or earth wobbles, he tracked the<br>
systematic development of human thought beginning from questions we all<br>
have in common (because we all experience the same objective reality), an=<br>
d<br>
following the logic of the answers as they are tried out in concrete form=<br>
s<br>
of life.  Coincidentally, he also looked to approximately 300 year<br>
increments (not really "cycles" but periods of translating thoughts to<br>
their full consequential forms).<br>
<p>
Some interesting things he wrote:  "The ideological presuppositions of an=<br>
y<br>
given era ultimately determine the character of all its arts =AD what kin=<br>
ds<br>
of artifacts it produces, and what forms they take.  Likewise they will<br>
determine any fundamental changes of artistic style or directions of<br>
development =AD both for those arts supporting current ideologies, and th=<br>
ose<br>
opposed....  All arts and artifacts everywhere embody the ideas and<br>
aspirations of human beings at a given moment in time...."<br>
<p>
Hmmm...  No mention of sunspots or climatological mood swings here, only<br>
individual human thoughts.<br>
<p>
Gowans: "Ideas can only develop in minds already accepting their<br>
presuppositions; and these presuppositions cannot be forced in, nor picke=<br>
d<br>
up by chance observation.  Or more succinctly, to be absorbed and acted<br>
upon, truths must seem self-evident.  The kind of questions that any<br>
civilization asks about itself and the world is determined by the<br>
presuppositions it takes to be self-evident truths....  Underlying mental=<br>
<p>
attitudes of civilization in any age are not transmissible in the ordinar=<br>
y<br>
sense.  They are absorbed by rather than taught to its members.  They are=<br>
<p>
not arrived at by reasoning processes, but instead provide the foundation=<br>
<p>
for whatever reasoning processes a given civilization may employ...."<br>
<p>
I think Damien gets at some of this when he writes "the collectivity tend=<br>
s<br>
to lag another decade behind the cultural standard-bearers.  This communa=<br>
l<br>
sluggishness might be dubbed `Zeitgeist inertia'."<br>
<p>
Gowans concludes: "So far from arts being determined by means of producti=<br>
on<br>
or being reflections of the spirit of an age, the principle of arts being=<br>
<p>
determined by social function makes them chief agents for the ideas which=<br>
<p>
determine economic, political, religious, and all other institutions of<br>
society.  Or more simply =AD arts create Zeitgeist, not the other way rou=<br>
nd."<br>
<p>
Its true that social functions are formed by many factors, including<br>
climate and geography; but always foremost is the factor of the<br>
individual's relations with groups of outsiders, that is, individuals who=<br>
<p>
do not hold the presuppositions taken to be self-evident truths.  Our own=<br>
<p>
inventions and the nutcases who wield them are far more of a threat to<br>
human survival than anything Mother Nature is likely to throw our way.  S=<br>
o,<br>
arts are determined by social function, which is overwhelmingly determine=<br>
d<br>
by individuals, and arts create Zeitgeist - the role of the weather seems=<br>
<p>
to be missing.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;A Sender exchanges a Message with the Receiver (or addressee)<br>
about some aspect of their shared World, written in a common Code and<br>
transmitted through an error-correcting, reliable Channel.  This brutally=<br>
<p>
reduced analysis can be critiqued, deconstructed and reassembled, but it<br>
stands up pretty well once you see that there's always a flow<br>
back-and-forth between writer and reader.&gt;<br>
<p>
No need to critique, deconstruct or reassemble this, the premise is fatal=<br>
ly<br>
flawed at the outset.  I do not see that there's always a flow<br>
back-and-forth between writer and reader.  This is nonsense.  A writer<br>
sends forth words into the wild blue yonder.  Period.  One-way.  The<br>
message is not "exchanged," it is sent.  What the reader does with it is =<br>
up<br>
to the reader, not the writer, and most certainly not with the climate or=<br>
<p>
with sunspots.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;The history of writing, according to literary critic Christine<br>
Brooke-Rose, can be seen as an itinerary `round and round the Jakobson<br>
diagram'.&gt;<br>
<p>
It can also be seen in many other ways, but which way is true?  The histo=<br>
ry<br>
of writing is not cyclical in any way, it is a tale of individuals, of<br>
point-sources of words cast upon the ocean or its tributaries, to be<br>
delivered up to a fortuitously receptive mind, or to be stuck in an eddy =<br>
of<br>
oblivion.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;Strikingly, the six communication components are themselves<br>
large-scale dominants, which have regulated the flow of ideas in the last=<br>
<p>
six centuries - and perhaps much longer.  These large-scale dominants see=<br>
m<br>
to orchestrate a grand waltz of ruling discourses from one generation to<br>
its successor.  Call them, handily, We (addressee), I (sender), It (world=<br>
),<br>
Text or Theory (message), Language (code), and Rule or Algorithm<br>
(channel).&gt;<br>
<p>
Sigh...  More pop mysticism of a new variety and just when I was starting=<br>
<p>
to get the hang of interpreting planetary conjunctions within Placidian<br>
houses.  I can't wait for eudaemonia-in-a-pill, all this learning new<br>
arcania is so painful.  I'll cover this tiresome academic quasi-determini=<br>
sm<br>
in some general comments down below.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;In my new book "Theory and Its Discontents," I propose a kind of=<br>
<p>
discursive Theory of Everything, which plots a cyclical sequence of six<br>
phases or dominants (drawn from the Jakobson communication circuit) in th=<br>
e<br>
histories of both the humanities and the sciences.  It's quite a shocking=<br>
<p>
thought, of course.&gt;<br>
<p>
Nothing shocking about this thought at all, except that here it comes aga=<br>
in<br>
on the E-list.  This whole historical cycle nonsense was brought up by so=<br>
me<br>
fortune-teller wannabe back in March of this year.  I recall some ravings=<br>
<p>
about "The Fourth Turning" by Strauss &amp; Howe.  I will repeat what I poste=<br>
d<br>
then, that the market-targeted readers for this genre are the<br>
tried-and-true gullible aging yuppies with the narcissistic urge to read<br>
about their life, have their palms read and have money to waste.  Once<br>
again, the fallacy of analysis like this, is that you can start arbitrari=<br>
ly<br>
anywhere in history, in any given year, and make historical facts fit<br>
whatever cycle you choose, quite possibly without invoking either Ptolemy=<br>
's<br>
epicycles or Guth's inflation.  But history is continuous, one year after=<br>
<p>
another, no one year any different than any other year, every year of equ=<br>
al<br>
length.  No year is to be given a privileged position when starting a<br>
cyclical analysis.  There is no "generation" identifiable anywhere except=<br>
<p>
in relation to yourself and yourself alone.  To arbitrarily assert<br>
otherwise is to commit a category error in analysis.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;Two obvious sites to look for the primary script of such a<br>
multi-generational round are both located in human evolutionary biology. =<br>
<p>
The first is the generations of history.  Could human chronicles form<br>
chapters of a regular length, so to speak?  The second is the succession =<br>
of<br>
stages of each individual's life.  Might the life-cycle sequence somehow<br>
merge and control the diverse ingredients of that narrative hubbub we cal=<br>
l<br>
history?  Those are quite different questions from the discredited<br>
historicisms of Hegel or Marx.&gt;<br>
<p>
The generations of history is "The Fourth Turning" sleight-of-hand, utter=<br>
ly<br>
arbitrary unless self-centered.  The succession of stages is just more<br>
quasi-deterministic academic depth pschology (like Gail Sheehy using big<br>
words).  They both are recognized as being another permutation of<br>
historicism, the attempt to sneak determinism back into liberty-loving<br>
Western polities to subvert them, and just as discredited as any other<br>
variety.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;Clearly, what's needed is a theoretical perspective able to bind=<br>
<p>
together the empirical evidence for historical recurrences, and organise<br>
them into a schema of some robustness.&gt;<br>
<p>
Clearly, what's needed is some extreme skepticism about so-called<br>
"empirical evidence" for historical recurrences.  Individuals aren't<br>
pistons in an engine, they never recur.  Individuals make history and<br>
individuals never recur, so why should history recur?  History in the<br>
modern sense only arose when the individual was taken to be of supreme<br>
worth, the dignity of man.  This was specific to Greco-Roman culture and<br>
Western Christianity, no other cultures, anywhere or any time, ever<br>
developed this notion.  Attempts to make history into quasi-deterministic=<br>
<p>
recurrent cycles are therefore attempts to degrade the worth of the<br>
individual, to strip the dignity from the lone human.  Indeed, it flushes=<br>
<p>
the notion of history down the toilet and takes science along with it.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;We are now living through the exhausted stage of an American<br>
century, and, if no better and more humane means is devised for<br>
adjudicating leadership, the world is probably doomed to a new global war=<br>
<p>
in perhaps 2030 (but not until then).&gt;<br>
<p>
"Exhausted stage"?  Is this an empirical statement of fact, or might it b=<br>
e<br>
a bit of chafing over Australia being off the radar screen when it comes =<br>
to<br>
current superpower status?  "Humane means" for "adjudicating leadership" =<br>
is<br>
always - always - code for One World Government.  Adjudicating requires<br>
jurisdictional authority, such jurisdiction in the question of world<br>
leadership can only be the entire world.  I'm afraid that world tyranny<br>
won't go down well with several groups of individuals who have access to<br>
weapons of mass destruction and the will to use them to protect their own=<br>
<p>
jurisdiction from encroaching world elite busybodies who want to save the=<br>
m<br>
from themselves.  In the meantime, thanks for the hot tip!  I'm investing=<br>
<p>
heavily in stock put options that expire in '29.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;It is a prediction of this model that the channel-oriented, the<br>
algorithmic, the generic will command the first 25 or 50 years of the new=<br>
<p>
millennium.  Such emphases on rule, rote and formulae work both for good<br>
and ill, creatively expressed as computerised virtual realities and<br>
stultifyingly as media pap.  There will be resurgent local loyalties<br>
(something we are seeing already, often marked by blood), with routinised=<br>
<p>
work or none at all.&gt;<br>
<p>
I've seen more unambiguous horoscopes than this, casting haruspices is<br>
tricky work.  The ol' forecasting rule of thumb is:  "give 'em a date or<br>
give 'em a number but never give 'em both at the same time."<br>
<p>
Some general comments:<br>
<p>
Isaiah Berlin in "The Crooked Timber of Humanity" writing on where these<br>
quasi-deterministic ideas come from: "The relativism which has so deeply<br>
troubled historians, sociologists, anthropologists and philosophers of<br>
history during the last hundred years is, in the main, if not entirely, a=<br>
<p>
legacy of the schools of thought which look upon human activity as being<br>
largely caused by occult and inescapable forces of which explicit social<br>
beliefs and theories are rationalizations =AD disguises to be penetrated =<br>
and<br>
exposed.  This is the heritage of Marxism, of depth psychology, of the<br>
sociology of Pareto or Simmel or Mannheim."<br>
<p>
Ugh... there it is, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse - Marxism,<br>
psychology, sociology and anthropology.  Individuals, beware!<br>
<p>
I posted to the E-list about "Individualistic History" back in March '97.=<br>
 =<br>
<p>
The occasion was some excellent comments by the Australian historian Keit=<br>
h<br>
Windschuttle, in his essay "The Real Stuff of History" published in "The<br>
New Criterion" March 1997.  Windschuttle correctly pointed out that<br>
anthropology and sociology have long lost their intellectual<br>
respectability.  He also delivered a devastatingly accurate indictment of=<br>
<p>
why academia has waged war on the individual.<br>
<p>
First, he points out that Ferdinand Braudel (mentioned by Damien) wrote i=<br>
n<br>
"The Identity of France": "Men do not make history, rather it is history<br>
above all that makes men and absolves them of blame."  Therefore, I would=<br>
<p>
say that attempts to find deterministic cycles in history, whether it's<br>
caused by our genes or by the climate, are childish efforts to achieve<br>
freedom from the consequences of our actions.<br>
<p>
Secondly, he wrote about the reaction of Western academia to the politica=<br>
l<br>
disappointments of 1968:  "[T]his kind of historical determinism became a=<br>
<p>
comfort blanket for the academic Left.  There was no longer any need for =<br>
a<br>
radical to be politically active since activism could make no difference =<br>
to<br>
the great determining structures.  All that remained was to study,<br>
theorize, and debate the nature of the structures themselves.  This was a=<br>
n<br>
agenda perfectly suited to the academic world of seminars, conferences,<br>
cafes, and bars, and to the careers, tenure, and promotions that have<br>
focused their minds ever since."<br>
<p>
Ouch!  I'm glad I'm not a professor, that barb would've sunk deep.<br>
