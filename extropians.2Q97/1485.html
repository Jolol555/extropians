<i>&gt; &gt; I will point out for the "New York is a filthy dangerous city" crowd</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that New York is now at the bottom of the list for crime rates in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cities above 1 Million in the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So, for those looking for a nice, safe place to live, come to New</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; York!  We need more Extropians here!</i><br>

Although there are times when the frustration of some members of NYPD<br>
expresses itself in unwarrented manners, the number of incidents where<br>
this actually happens are very few and far between.<br>
It must be remembered that there is an unfortunate tendancy on the part<br>
of the mass media to emphasize the negative disproportianately. The<br>
effect on an uncritical general public is invariably received in an<br>
uncognitive, and primarily emotional framework. <br>
Critical thinking has not yet become as commonplace in our cultural<br>
evolution as we would like. If the media persist in their de-emphasis on<br>
critical analysis and fail to provide appropriate and balanced coverage<br>
of daily events, lacking a viable alternative to these induced vicarious<br>
adventures, would not humankind respond accordingly in most<br>
instances?<br>
