About a month ago we had a discussion, after some inquiries about <br>
supplements and nootropics, of how to test and measure the effects of <br>
these substances.<br>
<p>
Lee Daniel Crocker suggested this was "simple":<br>
&lt;Give a dozen people a euphoric, and another dozen a vitamin or <br>
something, then have them all answer multiple-choice questions about <br>
how they feel. If the answers to some question correlate strongly <br>
enough with those who took the real drug, you've shown a measured <br>
effect (certainly not a conclusive one, but at least better than <br>
nothing).&gt;<br>
<p>
While what Lee suggested may be a useful approach for determining if <br>
there is *any* effect, I suggested it wouldn't be very helpful for <br>
quantifying or qualifying the effect because human health, moods and <br>
cognitive capacities, are too complex a system to submit to simple <br>
mechanical measurements.  One of the reasons, I suggested, was that <br>
these substances can have multiple effects and the effects may differ <br>
depending on the subject's neurochemical background at the time.<br>
<p>
Along these lines, today's Wall Street Journal has several articles <br>
that look at the surprising complexity in the effects of one of the <br>
most commonly used nootropic substances, namely nicotine.<br>
<p>
One article, "Kicking the Habit: Personality May Predispose Some to <br>
Nicotine Addiction" by Robert Langreth, notes that "Indeed, nicotine <br>
even seems to have varying effects on the same people at different <br>
times of day" and quotes Neal Benowitz, a tobacco researcher at the <br>
University of California at San Francisco, saying "It is one of the <br>
few drugs that can be a stimulant first thing in the morning, a <br>
tranquilizer later in the day for people who are anxious and a mild <br>
antidepressant for people who are feeling a little down".<br>
<p>
One of the difficulties in substantiating nootropic effects is that, <br>
over time, the body acquires a 'tolerance' to them so that the effects <br>
can vary depending on how long someone has used the substance.  As <br>
Langreth's article puts it: "Researchers don't know exactly why, but <br>
they suspect that over time, the brain becomes accustomed to operating <br>
with a certain level of nicotine, and eventually depends on nicotine <br>
to produce even normal levels of dopamine and other brain chemicals."<br>
<p>
The article also pointed out that genes may be important for who <br>
becomes addicted to nicotine: "Numerous studies of identical twins <br>
show that if one twin smokes, the other also does about 80% of the <br>
time; this is true only about half of the time for fraternal twins, <br>
who don't have matching genes. The commonality between identical twins <br>
exists even in cases where the twins were reared apart, indicating <br>
that genetics -- not environmental factors like the close bond that <br>
often forms between twins -- are at work."<br>
<p>
A companion article, "Kicking the Habit: Antidepressants Give New Hope <br>
To Hard Cases Trying to Quit" by Elyse Tanouye, also provides some <br>
insights on the multiple and synergistic effects nicotine and other <br>
nootropics may have.  Basically, this article describes how nicotine <br>
affects dopamine and norepinephrine levels but seems not to affect <br>
serotonin levels.<br>
<p>
Linda H. Ferry who conducted a study at a California VA medical center <br>
said that "Nicotine is the best and most effective over-the-counter <br>
antidepressant available in the world". Her study found that <br>
Wellbutrin (generic name bupropion, which may soon be approved by the <br>
FDA as Zyban) is an effective substitute for nicotine because it <br>
boosts both dopamine and norepinephrine levels: "In two small trials, <br>
she found that smokers who took the drug were two or three times more <br>
likely to quit than those who took a placebo."<br>
<p>
Most interesting to me, as a recovering smoker now using only the <br>
nicotine gum, was the insight that there are "nicotine receptors <br>
inside the mouth and throat" in addition to those in the brain.  In <br>
fact, in my own experience, I could do without nicotine most of the <br>
time (I still chew four or five 2 mg pieces per day) except for the <br>
oral craving.  Jed Rose, a Duke University nicotine researcher, has <br>
had success "using substances like citric acid" to relieve these <br>
cravings.  This confirmed my own experience that grapefruit juice was <br>
a big help in reducing these cravings.  I've also noticed that <br>
piracetam somehow almost completely eliminates these cravings, as well <br>
as the more generalized nicotine anxiety which probably originates in <br>
the brain.<br>
<p>
The point for Extropians, most of whom are probably not smokers, is <br>
that any of these nootropic substances that work on the brain are <br>
likely to have many, entangled and difficult to measure effects.<br>
