Where do you get this?  I admit I'm less sensitive to such things, but I<br>
haven't noticed many denouncings of art and entertainment on the list.<br>
All I remember is Eliezer's obsession with Singularity-creating as the<br>
primary and only goal of his life.  In fact, I thought the cyclical<br>
complaint about the list was that there was too much play and creativity<br>
on it that wasn't backed up by efforts to apply to the real world.  I<br>
certainly haven't noticed an oversupply of technical data or<br>
mathematical theorems on the list.<br>
<p>
I have heard suggestions that the proportion of technical types at home<br>
in the liberal arts is probably higher than the proportion of liberal<br>
arts natives at home in technical subjects.  Of course there isn't so<br>
much social approval of a defensive pride in ignorance of the<br>
humanities, the way people can shrug off not having a mathematical or<br>
scientific clue in most circles.<br>

<p>
Insofar as for me "extroping" is not something I worry about applying to<br>
my entire life, you don't have much to contribute.  It's not that I'm<br>
too stodgy to appreciate art; I'm a very big fan of fairy tales and<br>
Celtic music.  Visual tastes aren't so well-developed, but what I've<br>
seen in members' galleries hasn't grabbed me.  Ditto for much of the<br>
poetry.  As I lack the language and concepts to usefully criticize what<br>
I don't like of "transhuman art", and am too subjectivist to place a<br>
high priority on learning how at the moment, exactly what should I do?<br>
When I think of "extroping" (actually I've never used such a word<br>
myself) I think of Della Lu or the High Willow, and those connections<br>
are largely technically defined.<br>

There's something in my garden, it's been there for a week.<br>
I tried to feed it crackers, but that only made it squeak.<br>
I tried to wash its scaly head, but all it did was cry,<br>
So I think I'll put it back to bed, and sing it a lullaby:<br>
