That's bogus.  If the software I write doesn't end up smarter than I am,<br>
I'll be in trouble come salary review time.  Not smarter in general, of<br>
course-- but smarter at the tasks people will buy it for.  <br>

<i>&gt;How far has self-learning computing</i><br>

<p>
It's charging right along.  There are plenty of people out there making<br>
money from machines learning how to do stuff, and plenty more people in<br>
universities and research labs coming up with new methods.  I used to be in<br>
the second category, and am now trying to be in the first.  There seems to<br>
be about a ten-year gap between development and commercial deployment,<br>
because that's how long it takes to know if a technique isn't a loser.<br>
<p>
We're still a long way from 'general-purpose intelligence'.  The present<br>
state of the commercial art is to point a program at a database of a bunch<br>
of stuff that's happened in the past, and then ask it what's the best thing<br>
to do in a new situtation.  For example, you might have a database of loan<br>
applications, and whether those people later defaulted on their loans, and<br>
you can ask the program if a given application is likely to be a good one or<br>
a bad one.  That's the level of boringness of typical uses of machine learning.<br>
