<i>&gt; "followers"</i><br>
<i>&gt; than it has now. Our "enemies" are not just the politicians and business</i><br>
<i>&gt; conglomerates and their henchmen who rule the present "system", but also</i><br>
<i>&gt; "the people" themselves. They are the ones who really hold the system up,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and prevent important social/political/ economical/technological change.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The reasons for this are of course a childish fear of "the unknown", an</i><br>
<i>&gt; aversion to personal responsibility, pure laziness, stupidity and related</i><br>
<i>&gt; negative characteristics. Indeed, most people prefer to huddle up</i><br>
<i>&gt; under the ubusive wings of Big Brother, pretending to be safe, rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; to boldly and independently surge forwards in life, always looking for</i><br>
<i>&gt; improvement.</i><br>

Dear fellow Extropians, <br>
It must first be understood that politics is the art of the possible.<br>
<p>
Is it possible for any individual or small group to influence a large<br>
political organization for the purpose of bringing about change?<br>
<p>
The answer is yes. You cannot expect change to occur overnight in most<br>
instances, however. The object in a political organization is to<br>
influence prevailing opinion by presenting logical, viable alternatives<br>
to existing policy and ideology.<br>
Frequently, this is an evolutionary activity. <br>
It's not that easy to change the minds of the people whose primary<br>
activity is political involvement as an outlet of their daily<br>
frustrations. <br>
We are not dealing with great intellectuals or academiticians, but<br>
rather with people who are simply trying to survive in a world they did<br>
not make. <br>
Most people are willing to accept change if they understand how it will<br>
benefit them. <br>
If all of society re enlightened through continuous education and<br>
knowledge accumulates, change occurs that much faster. <br>
Maybe we can consider the move to Mars next year.<br>
