New Documentary on Waco to show in Austin this Week<br>
<p>
A new, million-dollar production about the government's role at the Waco<br>
disaster is creating quite a stir as it is shown around the nation.  The<br>
documentary comes to Austin this week and will show at the Dobie Theater<br>
beginning this Friday.  The Friday 7 p.m. showing will be followed by a<br>
panel of Waco survivors discussing the incident and taking questions from<br>
the audience.  Movie times can be obtained by calling 472-3456.  What<br>
follows are excerpts of a review of this movie that appeared in the March<br>
14th issue of The Texas Observer:  <br>
<p>
<p>
Waco: The Rules of Engagement, A film by William Gazecki and Dan<br>
Gifford.  More than a year has passed since the Justice Department<br>
admitted that its troops had been trigger-happy at Ruby Ridge, but the<br>
Feds' position on Waco hasn't changed. "We looked at the entire<br>
situation and we made the best judg-ment we could," Attorney General<br>
Janet Reno maintains. . ..<br>
<p>
Waco: The Rules of Engagement is a critical look at the 1993 assault<br>
on the religious group led by David Koresh, and it's unlikely that<br>
anyone who sees the nearly three-hour documentary will agree with the<br>
Attorney General. The film is playing to unexpectedly large<br>
audiences. It opened at Utah's Sundance Festi-val in January, played<br>
at A&amp;M's Texas Film Festival in February . . ..<br>
<p>
Rules of Engagement doesn't use drama for polemical purposes or make<br>
claims it can't sustain. It is not the child of a garage or attic<br>
studio: its makers say it has cost nearly a million dollars, and as<br>
docu-mentaries go, it has the feel of a real flick: dramatic<br>
structure, soundtrack, tear-jerking conclusion, the works. Director<br>
William Gazecki and executive producer and writer Dan Gifford are not<br>
Hollywood big names, but that, after all, is the point of film<br>
festivals.<br>
<p>
The film's summary of the issues surrounding the Waco affair<br>
demonstrates newsman Gifford's be-lief in "balanced reporting." The<br>
documentary includes Congressional testimony by Kiri Jewell "the<br>
teen-ager who claims she was sexually molested by David Koresh" and<br>
the stinging critiques of New York Congressman and gun foe Charles<br>
Schumer, the charging bull of the 1995 Congressional hearings on<br>
Waco. Even Janet Reno mutters her story, saying, among other things,<br>
that the tanks that the FBI deployed at Mount Carmel were "like a good<br>
rent-a-car."<br>
<p>
The film presents a half-dozen sources that print journalists . . .<br>
couldn't tap in the years immedi-ately following the events. The prize<br>
catch, brought in by researcher Mike McNulty, a Colorado insurance man<br>
turned Waco sleuth, is leathery McClennan County Sheriff Jack Harwell,<br>
who had little to say during the fifty-one-day siege in 1993. In the<br>
film, Harwell doesn't exactly call federal lawman flatfeet or<br>
murder-ers, but what he does say raises some important questions about<br>
the sanctioned version of the Mount Car-mel story. "We had a bunch of<br>
women, children, elderly people, they were all good, good people," the<br>
sheriff says. "I was around them quite a lot. They were always nice,<br>
married, they minded their own busi-ness, they were never<br>
overbearing."<br>
. . ..<br>
<p>
At Sundance, viewers who sat through this long film despite knowing<br>
how it would end, didn't even yawn during its lengthy re-runs of<br>
C-Span Congressional testimony. And when the film did end, the<br>
festi-val's ski-and-film buffs were convinced that the government's<br>
hands are not clean.<br>
<p>
Even liberals as confirmed as Carol Gnade, director of the Utah<br>
chapter of the American Civil Lib-erties Union, left the film<br>
perturbed. "My gut feeling when I was watching," she says, "was that<br>
there was so much that as a citizen I didn't know about what happened<br>
at Waco. Organizations like the ACLU and NRA have to keep a closer eye<br>
on events like that."<br>
<p>
Few issues connect interests as diverse as the ACLU and the National<br>
Rifle Association"which is one of the oddities that keeps the Waco<br>
controversy alive. Rules of Engagement further erodes the official<br>
version of what happened in Waco in April 1993. With any luck, the<br>
film will create enough public pres-sure to elicit new information<br>
about a mystery that refuses to die.<br>
