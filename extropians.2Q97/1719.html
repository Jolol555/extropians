The extropian interest in smart drugs could be a problem.  Especially the<br>
illegal ones.<br>
<p>

<p>
I don't think people would see Extropian ideas as a threat until they start<br>
to become a reality.  Most people can't grasp them, or simply dismiss them as<br>
stupidity.  However, if we started serious attempts to aid research into<br>
these things (which I would like to see us do) then they'll be problems.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  We have a long way to go before we reach the level of cult that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Catholic church has reached.  Of course, we have a long way to go before</i><br>
we<br>
<i>&gt;  reach their level of political pull as well (at which point everyone would</i><br>
<i>&gt;  start losing political pull, anarcho-capatilism forever!).</i><br>
<p>
How about an extropian party!?  Maybe then we'll see some change.<br>
