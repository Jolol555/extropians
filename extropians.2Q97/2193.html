Dear Extropian List Reader,<br>
<p>
Tonight, I will be posting the following Prometheus Project update to<br>
CryoNet, sci.cryonics, and sci.life-extension. I am posting it here,<br>
since this is an important announcement and many of you do not read<br>
CryoNet.<br>
<p>
<p>
Prometheus Project Update<br>
<p>
Two major developments have taken place since my last report<br>
on the Prometheus Project. First, a $10,000 per year pledge has been<br>
received from Walter De Brouwer of Belgium who wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We have done our best to publicize your research programme and due to</i><br>
<i>&gt;our good reputation in research I have been offered a board seat on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Visionary Research Funding Committee of the European Commission.  That</i><br>
<i>&gt;is where I could take this further (although I encountered a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;unbelief and scepticism already).  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Now I want my company to make a pledge of 10,000 $/year.</i><br>
<p>
In a reply to my thank-you note, Walter wrote:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;If you are ever in the neighbourhood of our countries (or anyone from</i><br>
<i>&gt;prometheus) we'll set something up to introduce them to the right &gt;people.</i><br>
<p>
The second major development is the offer of $100,000 in immediate<br>
research funding plus the use of a laboratory, its equipment (including<br>
3 electron microscopes), and access to specialized testing and analysis<br>
in other labs as necessary. The lab facilites being offered are located<br>
in a major university medical center and the person (a cryonicist<br>
medical doctor) offering this package is the Head of Pathology at that<br>
center. A dialogue between this person and a well known cryobiologist is<br>
in progress which aims to develop research plans for a pilot project to<br>
begin prior to the achievement of the Prometheus Project's targeted<br>
pledge total. Several months ago, there was a proposal and discussion on<br>
the Prometheus pledgers forum about the possibility of such a pilot<br>
project and several pledgers indicated, at that time, that they would be<br>
willing to commit their pledge funds early toward such a pilot project. <br>
It is hoped that such a project will show that the Prometheus Project<br>
is  "really" going to happen, and, as a consequence, accelerate the<br>
achievement of its goals.<br>
<p>
In addition, pledges were received from:<br>
<p>
Doug Platt for $500 per year to join with someone else who is pledging a<br>
like amount;<br>
<p>
Brook Norton for $1000 per year who wrote: "I'm glad to be of some help<br>
on this project and thank you for your tremendous effort to make<br>
Prometheus happen"; <br>
<p>
and two pledgers who wanted to remain anonymous. The first, who pledged<br>
$1000 per year wrote: "Good luck and kudos on your persistence". The<br>
second for $2000 per year came just two days ago.<br>
<p>
Many thanks to these new pledgers for emphasizing their concern for<br>
conserving life through support of the Project. Naturally, I am<br>
delighted with these events and will keep readers posted about further<br>
developments.<br>
<p>
