	I love a well reasoned argument.  Maybe it can be used to persuade the<br>
algae to separate from the fungus in a lichen so that it can assume its<br>
full individuality, just before it dies.  <br>
	The concept of the individual is not rooted in stone.  It is rooted in<br>
malleable cells that make up tissue, that make up neural sub-systems, which<br>
go on to make up the entire nervous system.  If one adds more neurons, or<br>
sub-systems is one fundamentally altered?  Perhaps a person would like<br>
greater creative ability.  Would adding another "creative region" destroy<br>
their individuality?  What if they simply borrow it when another person is<br>
not using it in exchange for the other person using part of their brain? <br>
Another idea would be to share experiences.  Having direct access to<br>
another's experience could be very useful in avoiding making certain<br>
mistakes.  Would it destroy another's individuality?  Perhaps I should have<br>
said "formerly limited individual" in attempts to avoid a knee jerk<br>
response.<br>
