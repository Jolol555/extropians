<i>&gt; It's not a technological problem. You can get &gt;200 MHz laptops with</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough memory to do almost anything you would with a desktop</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer. Internet is usually not a problem, 56K modem or perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; ISDN will get you far enough. As a mobile knowledge worker, you</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't need any reference books, most of the information is on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Internet or on CD-roms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Mobile working is also getting less and less a social problem, as</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication is getting better and better. Teamwork will always</i><br>
<i>&gt; require a fair amount of communication between the players, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; physical distance is no longer an obstable for that. You still have</i><br>
<i>&gt; to meet people face to face, but being mobile will be an advantage,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not a disadvantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I can't think of any jobs that I would like to do that I couldn't do</i><br>
<i>&gt; anywhere. (I admit working on the factory floor for some big</i><br>
<i>&gt; software company is not on my list.) To me, the only difference</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the only reason to go mobile is to become truly Transnational</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Transcultural.</i><br>

There are many many things at which you could do as a nomad. Freelance<br>
writing, programming, system administration, web authoring. You could<br>
set up a web page which generates revenue, either from Advertisments<br>
or merchandise sales. And if you set yourself up with the right<br>
structure, you could live on considerably less than you think.<br>

I am Internet Administrator for a major US VAR. My only need for<br>
actually being here at my desk is twofold. A) On rare occasions I need<br>
physical access to our machines to reboot them. This is being migrated<br>
to our 24 hour operations staff. B) To make my boss feel like he's in<br>
control. The main barrier to working from home is political.<br>
