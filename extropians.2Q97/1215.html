Hi.<br>
<p>
Since people on this list occasionally inquire about various aspects of<br>
investing on the stock market (esp. tech stocks), I would like know if<br>
anyone on this list would be interested in starting some type of investment<br>
club.<br>
<p>
Investment is essential for financial security and is accessible even to<br>
people of meager financial means.  Since, many extropians are planning on<br>
living indefinitely, it would be prudent to start planning your very<br>
long-term finances now.  Intelligent investments usually result in being<br>
independently wealthy when applied for ~40 years, even if the investments<br>
appear small.<br>
<p>
If there is enough interest, I would be willing to donate my experience<br>
with investing as well as my access to investment information resources to<br>
help out those of you with less experience than I.  And if there are other<br>
experienced investors out there, I would hope that they would be willing to<br>
share their knowledge as well.<br>
<p>
Additionally, I would be willing to operate a website and other Internet<br>
services dedicated to this.  I am half-owner of a couple modest servers and<br>
some redundant T-1 connections, so it would cost me nothing other than my<br>
time.<br>
<p>
<p>
If anyone is interested in becoming involved in something like this, please<br>
let me know.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
