     Michael,<br>
     <br>
     Interesting essay.  I like the metaphor of prejudice applied to our <br>
     culture's current sexuality conflict.  Although I can see this getting <br>
     published as an editorial or at least as an abridged letter to the <br>
     editor, I'd a) grammar check it and b) remove the consternation you <br>
     attribute to Gelenter's comments.  However influential he may be, even <br>
     a remotely vicious comment on his opinions or sensibility weakens your <br>
     credibility as I read it.  <br>
     <br>
     Using your analogy, as a gay man, when people are pounding or <br>
     resounding too loudly, I'm always inclined to think "where there's <br>
     smoke, there's fire."  Look at what's triggering your hostility, deal <br>
     with it and then re-read your comments.  Much potent and innovative <br>
     stuff.  I just feel that the harshness against Gelenter distracts the <br>
     reader's attention away from the possibility and toward an unresolved <br>
     and unamplified personal conflict.<br>
     <br>
     Just a suggestion.  Enjoyed your thoughts.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Rick<br>
