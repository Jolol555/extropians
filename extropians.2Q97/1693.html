Hi!<br>
<p>
I'm glad to see there were so many replies to my message. Thank you all.<br>
<p>
First of all, I'm going to the U.S. East Coast in August. I'm new to<br>
this mailing list but I would sure like to meet some other extropians,<br>
is there any of you in the East Coast in August willing to meet me?<br>
<p>
After reading your replies, I couldn't still form a conclusive opinion<br>
(is there anybody who can?) but here's some of my thoughts and comments<br>
on your replies.<br>
<p>
I think we all agree that genes are selfish and care about us only to<br>
create more like them.<br>
<p>
One divergent opinion was weather a gene that codes for extra longevity<br>
is good or evil? (in terms of reproductive success)<br>
<p>
My opinion is that it is good. If one organism lives longer, it has a<br>
higher chance to produce more offspring and therefore it is a good gene.<br>
It's as simple as that.<br>
<p>

<p>
You're making a mistake, you are assuming that aging is only the decayed<br>
state humans reach at their 70s, 80s, etc. This is not truth, the<br>
chances of a primitive human (or other mammal) to survive decrease due<br>
to aging after he reaches puberty (that is why primitive humans never<br>
died from the aging you name, they died at the first signs of aging).<br>
So, a non-aging primitive human should have an advantage.<br>
<p>
Anders Sandberg wrote this Medawar suggestion:<br>
<i>&gt; living longer would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; slight disadvantage (competition of resources)</i><br>
<p>
The gene is selfish, it only cares about himself and it is not going to<br>
kill himself as an altruistic act to favour others. The gene will<br>
continually create more copies, that is his mission.<br>
<p>
Finally, Lee Daniel Crocker wrote:<br>
<i>&gt; Evolution is a pretty simple mathematical phenomenon once you</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand it.  When applied to living organisms, it's quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; clear that immoratility serves no purpose to a gene's survival,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and in fact is detrimental in many cases.  Once's you're done</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproducing, your body is no longer useful to your genes' further</i><br>
<i>&gt; replication, so no evolutionary pressure to continue is present.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Evolution serves the replicators (genes, roughly speaking),</i><br>
<i>&gt; not organisms.</i><br>
<p>
If aging is not present, reproduction is never done, the body is always<br>
useful to the genes and evolutionary preassure is always present.<br>
<p>
If, indeed, a gene that codes for extra longevity is an advantage, why<br>
isn't it present?<br>
<p>
I don't know. The species that do not endure aging are very primitive<br>
ones, perhaps in mammals it is much more complex and since with aging we<br>
can still reproduce, the species continues. Perhaps to stop aging is so<br>
complex that it will take millions or billions of years for aging to<br>
naturally stop (although the consequences would be disastrous). Let's<br>
see what we have to say about it.<br>
<p>
                  Hasta la vista...<br>
