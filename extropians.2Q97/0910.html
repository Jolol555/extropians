I've had extropian ideas for a long time and when I found out that there was an <br>
extropian movement, I thought "Great!  There are people who think like me!  Perhaps are <br>
they going to help me grow faster."<br>
<p>
But all I see on web pages and all I read in this mailing list's messages are theories <br>
or general ideas.  I can make theories.  I can have general ideas.  We all can.  It's <br>
fun to think about exploiting the moon's ressources or about changing social structures, <br>
but it doesn't really change anything that can be immediately felt.<br>
<p>
I think it would be good to be a bit more practical about extropianism.  I'd really like <br>
to read information on where to get drugs that can make you think faster or feel a <br>
certain way.  Such drugs are sometimes legal and available to the public, but we just <br>
don't know about them.  Putting an end to this kind of ignorance would be beneficial to <br>
us.  Understanding how the drugs work on us could further our knowledge of ourselves and <br>
truly make us grow.<br>
<p>
And what about existing technology?  We've made wonderful things already, much more than <br>
we usually imagine.  Why dream about future technology when there's so much we already <br>
have but don't use?  Getting to know the tools we already can use would certainly help <br>
us acheive greater technological advences faster.<br>
<p>
What I'm saying is that it may be nice to dream about things, but it's better to do <br>
things, to apply theories, to build upon what's already built.  What I'd like to see is <br>
an "extropian resource guide" of some sort in which one could find information that <br>
could be immediately used to expand one's physical and intellectual capacities.<br>
<p>
Entries in that guide could include such things as hormones presently available to <br>
modify the body, chemicals presently available to modify the mind, technology already <br>
available to explore the human mind (biofeedback devices, personal EEG boxes, etc.), <br>
genetic analysis centers, "extropian food" presently available, etc...<br>
<p>
Sure, I want to be a cyborg, but right now, precisely what can science and technology <br>
make me?<br>
