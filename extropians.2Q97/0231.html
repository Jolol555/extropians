I agree with Lee about the lack of good information about supplements.<br>
Unfortunately there is a huge gulf between the people doing actual<br>
research (which is often quite misinterpeted; just reading a medline<br>
abstract supporting it doesn't prove substance X makes you smarter) and<br>
the people selling and using "smart drugs" and supplements. I'm reading<br>
Gilovich's _How We Know What Isn't So_ right now, a book about how we are<br>
often misled by our flawed reason, and almost every pitfall I read about<br>
are represented among the enthusiasts. Tragic. <br>

I agree that this should be done. It will not likely be strongly<br>
significant (you need plenty of subjects for that), but at least it is<br>
better than the usual "I've tried it and I feel great!". Of course, doing<br>
a good mini-study isn't entirely trivial since there are plenty of<br>
pitfalls, but it can be done. Maybe we should try writing a<br>
"laytranshumanists's guide to testing" explaining how to do a double-blind<br>
placebo study and analyze the data? <br>

<p>
This is a good example why it is easy to get fooled by small studies. In<br>
the above case, you implictly assume that the drug will have effect quite<br>
immediately (most medical models suggest it takes weeks), and if you are<br>
not doing it double-blind you are quite likely to influence the subjects.<br>
But the general idea is sound. We at Aleph have been thinking of doing<br>
"consumer testing" of smart drinks like Magic or Red Bull, comparing test<br>
results before and after, and adding comments about taste, price and<br>
nutrients. Maybe we transhumanists could work together on something like<br>
this? <br>
