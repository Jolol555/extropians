"What is the extropian stance on punishment? Personally, I am against<br>
the death penalty because I don't believe that two wrongs make a right.<br>
However, the issue takes on an added dimension when, in our envisioned<br>
immortalist future, murder is equivalent to denying someone eternity. What<br>
should the punishment be then?" <br>
<p>
Well, I think execution is the only right punishment for murderers, now and<br>
in the<br>
future. In fact, the whole justice system should be according to the<br>
supremely fair<br>
and consequent "an eye for an eye" principle. The punishment should be like<br>
a mirror<br>
image to the crime. Of course this usually isn't possible for reasons of<br>
practicality, but<br>
it *should* be the basic idea behind every judicial decision.<br>
<p>
Of course, c.p. should only exist in an "enlightened Extropian State",<br>
where you can <br>
actually (more or less) trust the legal authorities and (thus) only the<br>
guilty are punished.<br>
<p>
Reasons why to prefer execution over incarceration:<br>
<p>
1) It (execution) is a lot cheaper (no endless appeals in the new<br>
system)---Eternal <br>
imprisonment is  infinitely (!) expensive.<br>
2) It will prevent repetition by the same offender (guaranteed !)---One can<br>
escape from prison <br>
or get paroled or pardoned by bleeding heart humanists (and kill again).<br>
3) It *probably* has a better preventive function than imprisonment.<br>
4) It satisfies the rightful need for revenge of the freinds &amp; relatives of<br>
the victim <br>
a lot better than the prison alternative.<br>
5) It is the most rational, fair and consequent punishment for a horrible<br>
crime. <br>
If someone is killed, his future is taken away from him. Consequently, the<br>
offender <br>
should have no future either, not even in prison.<br>
<p>
The only really valid objection against capital punishment is the fact that<br>
if you<br>
accidentally execute an innocent person, you can't "bring him back".<br>
Fortunately,<br>
we have cryonics. Once (in a couple of decades or so) it is proven that<br>
suspensions<br>
can be successfully "reversed", it could become a standard practice to<br>
"freeze" a<br>
convict after execution. In case of a judicial error (which is btw very<br>
unlikely in an<br>
"Extropian System"), you can revive the victim, make excuses, pay damages,<br>
and<br>
all is well.<br>
<p>
Incidentally, I think corporal punishment should be (re-)introduced also.<br>
It is cheap,<br>
effective and very just...<br>
