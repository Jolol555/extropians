WHere is he getting the power to electrolyse the water? From power<br>
plants of course. I highly suggest that you get some hard facts on how<br>
much power his system demands from the grid. <br>
<p>
His claim of his vehicle "ruining the economy" is a bit extreme but not<br>
totally false, as the economy is not built for his technology. The<br>
problem is that there are not enough power plants to meet the needs if<br>
everyone converted to electric/hybrid/or hydrogen type vehicles. The<br>
reason why the California ZEV law mandating 3% of vehicles be electric<br>
ONLY mandates that 3% be electric is that California has a power surplus<br>
equal to what the additional demand would be if 3% of all car owners in<br>
the state converted to electric vehicles. With electric rates among the<br>
highest in the nation, when they export their surplus power to places<br>
like Washington or Oregon, they get only half the amount they get from<br>
customers in their own state, so they'd obviously like to make top<br>
dollar on every kWh they sell, and if they keep that power in their<br>
state and sell it to electric car owners, they make more profits. The<br>
reason why the state kept the level to 3% of car owners is that if more<br>
people converted than that, then demand on the grid would go up, which<br>
would 1) cause more power plants to be built, and 2) electric rates<br>
would go up due to market pressures.<br>
<p>
Politicians like keeping the status quo as quo as possible.<br>

As Wayme's buddy Garth said, "We fear change..."<br>
