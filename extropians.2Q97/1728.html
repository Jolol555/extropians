<p>
 How many top notch antibiotics from just a few years ago are now<br>
considered worthless? There is a new predator in this "human dominated<br>
ecosystem" and you can't even see it. Unless the population pressure is<br>
released by space colonization, our overburdening of the ecosystem will<br>
be our own demise. Since the ecosystem is our life support system on<br>
spaceship earth, claiming that its demise would not endanger us is like<br>
claiming you can shut off oxygen in the space shuttle and expect to live<br>
more than a few hours.... Don't get me wrong, I still think we will<br>
survive, but it will wind up becoming a VERY near thing, so much so that<br>
we will have a minimum of several decades to as much as a century of<br>
work to repair the damage once we've "graduated".<br>
