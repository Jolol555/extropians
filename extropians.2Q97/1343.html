 There is no way to avoid making a bet when investing. All you can do is<br>
choose between low risk and high risk bets.<br>
 Buying an index today is a bet that todays index prices aren't inflated<br>
by abnormal popularity of index investing. I could come up with other<br>
bets involved with index investing, but that is probably the riskiest today.<br>
 It is important to avoid making bets where the person you are betting against<br>
has more info than you. If you see a company whose price looks low enough<br>
that it's obviously a good buy, stop and think about why people are selling.<br>
If you can't find a good reason (i.e. they bought at a better price and are<br>
deciding it's time to diversify), assume they have knowledge of problems at<br>
the company that you haven't found yet.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;When investing in personal skills and new ventures, rather than in</i><br>
<i>&gt;financial markets, there is less market arbitrage and so a better</i><br>
<i>&gt;chance that your new idea really is better.  But try to be honest with</i><br>
<i>&gt;yourself about the degree to which you just enjoy this "investment"</i><br>
<i>&gt;activity, vs. it really having a big chance of paying off well.</i><br>
<p>
 This advice is very much true for investing in financial markets<br>
as well. Many investors fail to distinguish between the entertainment<br>
value they get from betting on an interesting company and the wealth<br>
they are likely to get from investing wisely. That usually interfers<br>
with their ability to make money.<br>

<i>&gt;I read an article (in Fortune, I think) that warned investors to be careful</i><br>

<i>&gt;5000. I'd be very interested to hear comments on this.</i><br>
<p>
 This concern should be taken seriously. I'd guess an S&amp;P index fund<br>
will underperform broader indexes by 0.5 to 1 percentage point over<br>
the next decade.<br>

<i>&gt;For those who haven't come across it, I recommend Microsoft Investor as a</i><br>
