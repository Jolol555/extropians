requests that the present letter and the attached report be<br>
circulated to all Member States as an official document of<br>
the General Assembly.<br>
<p>
Annex<br>
Information about the appearance in Cuba of the Thrips palmi<br>
plague.<br>
I.- Description of the facts.<br>
1-On 21 October 1996, at 10.08 hours, crew members of<br>
  scheduled flight CU- 170 of Cubana de Aviacion (Cuban<br>
  Airlines), on board a Fokker-27 aircraft, flying region<br>
  of Cuba, noticed a single-engine airplane flying from<br>
  north to south, at about 1, 000 feet (300 metres) above<br>
  them, apparently spraying or sprinkling unknown<br>
  substances - some seven times - in an intermittent<br>
  manner.<br>
2-At that very moment, Cubana de Aviacion Fokker aircraft<br>
  was located 25 to 30 kilo metres south of Varadero, in<br>
  Matanzas Province., flying at an altitude of 9, 000 feet<br>
  and at a speed of 400 kilo metres per hour.<br>
3-According to scheduled flights, objective radar control<br>
  and recordings of radio conversations between the<br>
  airplanes and ground control when the south in a course<br>
  perpendicular to the Cubana de Aviacion flight was a<br>
  fumigation aircraft Model SAR, register N3093M, of the<br>
  civilian aircraft registry of the United States of<br>
  America, operated by the State Department of that<br>
  country, as stated in the flight authorization requested<br>
  to the Institute registry of civilian aircraft . The<br>
  above-mentioned airplane had taken off from Patrick<br>
  United States Air Force Base, in Cocoa Beach in the state<br>
  of Florida, bound for Grand Cayman.<br>
4-The Cubana pilot immediately reported to flight control<br>
  on the release of unknown substances, in the form of a<br>
  white or greyish mist, by the SAR airplane. The Cuban air<br>
  controller established communication with the United<br>
  States aircraft and asked whether it was having any<br>
  technical problem, to which the pilot's answer was "NO".<br>
  He was also asked about the type of aircraft he was<br>
  flying, answering that it was a single-engine AY-65. That<br>
  conversation is recorded on tape.<br>
5-On 18 December 1996, the first signs of the presence of a<br>
  Thrips plague appeared in Matanzas Province, at potato<br>
  plantations of the Diamant variety, sowed 38 days before<br>
  on the "Lenin" State Horticultural Farm in Javelins<br>
  Municipality.  Samples of these organism were sent to the<br>
  Central Quarantine Laboratory of the National Pest<br>
  Control Center.<br>
6-On 26 December 1996, the Cuban ministry of Foreign<br>
  Affairs presented a note of complaint to the United<br>
  States Interest Section in Havana regarding the incident<br>
  that had occurred in the Giron corridor, urging the<br>
  United States party to take appropriate measures aimed at<br>
  the clarification of the event.<br>
7-On 12 February 1997, the United States Interest Section<br>
  in Havana handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br>
  of Cuba a reply to that note, stating that on the day of<br>
  the incident, the United states pilot had, during his<br>
  flight, seen a Cuban commercial airplane flying below,<br>
  and as he was nor certain of having seen, "following<br>
  caution and safety procedures, and with the purpose of<br>
  securing a positive visual contact, the pilot used the<br>
  "smoke generator" of his aircraft, in order to indicate<br>
  its location" adding that "the smoke vanished and no<br>
  fluid was poured from the airplane".<br>
8-On 14 February 1997, the Central Quarantine Laboratory<br>
  confirmed that the insect examined was the Thrips palmi<br>
  karay, exotic to Cuban territory until that moment.<br>
9-The Thrips palmi is indigenous to Asia. Since 1985 it has<br>
  scattered across certain Caribbean zones, including<br>
  Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. It is a<br>
  polyphagous phytophagan that infects practically all<br>
  crops, weeds and ornamental plants.  It is reported to be<br>
  a vector of viruses such as that known as TSWV. It is an<br>
  insect of difficult diagnosis, unknown to the majority of<br>
  Cuban specialists. It is self-propagated within a field,<br>
  and into neighbouring ones, disseminating mostly when<br>
  seedlings, fruits and vegetal material, including<br>
  topsoils, are moved from one place to another. It also<br>
  scatters by aerial means, particularly its larvae. It is<br>
  resistant to temperature changes. Its reproductive cycle<br>
  lasts between 15 and 21 days, depending on the host<br>
  plant.<br>
10-    Taking into the levels of highest density of the<br>
  insect population, it could be ascertained that the<br>
  primary source of the outbreak was located on the above-<br>
  mentioned "Lenin" State Horticultural Farm. Smaller<br>
  outbreaks were pinpointed in fields close to the villages<br>
  of Maximo Gomez and Bolondron, also in Matanzas Province,<br>
  a few kilo metres away from the main source.<br>
11-    In the first half of January 1997, outbreaks of the<br>
  same insect were spotted in municipalities south of<br>
  Havana Province, bordering Matanzas, affecting corn,<br>
  beans, pumpkins, cucumbers and other crops.<br>
12-    Once the insect was identified, the Government of<br>
  Cuba adopted a programme of emergency measures to fight<br>
  it, including chemical control, through the purchase of<br>
  pesticides, which in spite of its high cost, have not<br>
  achieved effective results.<br>
13-    At the end of March 1997, The Government of Cuba,<br>
  complying with international regulations, informed the<br>
  Secretary-General and the United Nations Center for<br>
  Disarmament, about the presence of Thrips palmi karay in<br>
  its territory, and notified this finding to the Food and<br>
  Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to<br>
  which Cuba applied for technical and financial assistance<br>
  to fight the pest.<br>
14-    At present, Thrips palmi is spread virtually<br>
  throughout Matanzas and La Habana Provinces, in two<br>
  municipalities of Cienfuegos Province, in some<br>
  municipalities of Pinar del Rio Province and in the<br>
  Island of Youth. Its presence has not been detected in<br>
  the central and eastern provinces of the country.<br>
<p>
II.- RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS.<br>
15-    The SAR aircraft, register N3093M, is used by the<br>
  State Department of the United States in the struggle<br>
  against drug trafficking, to destroy crops. The aircraft<br>
  utilizes two sprinkling systems: one for the use of<br>
  aerosols and liquid particles and another for dropping<br>
  solid particles. No smoke generator is known to be<br>
  installed aboard this aircraft.<br>
16-    The specialists appointed by the Cuban party to<br>
  clarify the event considered unlikely a voluntary or<br>
  involuntary leakage of fuel or oil, which is confirmed by<br>
  the answer given by the United States airplane pilot<br>
  himself to the Cuban air controller.<br>
17-    The argument used by the United States party in its<br>
  note of reply regarding the smoke release, appears, from<br>
  the technical point of view, weak and in contradiction<br>
  with the conversation held during the flight. On the<br>
  other hand it is not a standard procedure established for<br>
  this kind of situation.  The pilot of the Cuban Airline<br>
  Fokker asserts on the basis of his visual observation and<br>
  his previous experience as a pilot of fumigation<br>
  airplane, that the release made by the United states<br>
  aircraft was not of smoke but of a substance.<br>
18-    Bearing in mind the place where the unknown<br>
  substance was released, it can be established that the<br>
  most risky area for infection is a zone covering 15 to 20<br>
  kilometres to the west and 20 to 25 kilometres to the<br>
  east of the Giron air corridor, although the whole<br>
  territory of Mananas Province is considered a probable<br>
  infected zone. These zones match those actually infected<br>
  both by the primary and secondary outbreaks.<br>
19-    Considering the insect population found on 18<br>
  December 1996, at the main source of the outbreak,<br>
  specialists of the Cuban National Pest Control Centre<br>
  estimated the beginning of the plague to date back to<br>
  three or four previous generations.  Bearing in mind the<br>
  reproductive cycle of this insect, the beginning of the<br>
  infection can be ascertained as approximately 21 October<br>
  1996, which was precisely the date when the United States<br>
  S2R aircraft flew over this point.<br>
20-    Mindful of the distribution of the agent in<br>
  countries like Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica,<br>
  it would be expected that any natural occurrence would be<br>
  in the eastern region of Cuban territory, the closest to<br>
  those countries.  Its appearance mora than 600 kilometres<br>
  away from region is, therefore, odd and suspicious.<br>
21-    Although at first sight it could be expected that<br>
  the height of the flight of the S2R aircraft is not the<br>
  most appropriate for the dissemination of biological<br>
  agents, information is available regarding experiments<br>
  made by North Americans themselves in which that type of<br>
  agent was dropped from even higher altitudes. On the<br>
  other hand, the enduring features of the insect, mainly<br>
  in its larva state, make its survival possible at these<br>
  altitudes.<br>
22-    Because of its nature of being a polyphagous<br>
  phycophagan that strikes and severely damages practically<br>
  every crop, and is also resistant to a considerable<br>
  variety of pesticides, the Thrips palmi can be considered<br>
  ideal biological agents able to inflict heavy damage on<br>
  agricultural food crops. In a document entitled "Report<br>
  of the Subgroup for Investigation of Claims of Use or<br>
  Escape of Agents which Constitute Biological or Toxin<br>
  Weapons", of 29 February 1996, prepared by the Federation<br>
  of American Scientists, Thrips palmi are included among<br>
  the invertebrate that could come within the purview of<br>
  the Convention on Biological Weapons.<br>
23-    In this particular case, the behavior of the plague<br>
  in Cuba shows a polyphagia bigger than the one described<br>
  in the scientific literature.<br>
<p>
III.- CONCLUSIONS.<br>
24-    The analysis of the facts and the results of the<br>
  investigations allow us to relate, with a high degree of<br>
  accuracy, the appearance of Thrips palmi in Mananas<br>
  Province with the dropping, on 21 October 1996, of an<br>
  unknown substance by an aircraft operated by the United<br>
  States Department.<br>
25-    There is reliable evidence that Cuba has once again<br>
  been the target of biological aggression.<br>
