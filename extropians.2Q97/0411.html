<p>
Lookahead and awareness are not neeed; they just need to make choices<br>
that end up valuing future payoffs.  Children spend almost all their<br>
time investing in their human capital, investments which pay off later.<br>

<i>&gt;Hmm.  Are these asexuals in general, or immortal asexuals?  And does</i><br>
<i>&gt;asexual meaning cloning oneself or designing your offspring?</i><br>
<p>
The analysis is the same for all these variations, I think.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I find these papers very gratifying, since this result well matches my</i><br>
<i>&gt;most common view of the future.  SF representation... at least partial</i><br>
<i>&gt;matches are Culture Minds, the ship in Cherryh's _Voyager in Night_,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Niven's Outsiders, the aliens of 2001, Babylon-5's First Ones, possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt;DS9's changelings.  Patience and risk-aversion seem to be expected as</i><br>
<i>&gt;consequences of immortality; asexuality comes because the writers shy</i><br>
<i>&gt;away from attributing sexuality to such beings, and no one ever writes</i><br>
<i>&gt;in terms of Bayesianism but low-emotion rationality seems to be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;usual guess.  Curious survivalists.</i><br>
<p>
What these SF creatures lack is the very rapid growth rate predicted<br>
by these models: as fast as possible.  More like grey goo, Von Neuman<br>
machines, etc.<br>

<i>&gt;Do these papers take into account evolution of memetic parasites?  </i><br>
<p>
They are abstract models of simple evolution, rather than coupled<br>
evolutionary systems.  But if one posited memes as the primary<br>
evolution system, one might try to fit memes into these sort of<br>
models.  Then the question is: for a meme considering sacrificing<br>
consumption by today's host to benefit a potential future host, what<br>
is the chance that future host will actually host this meme?  If the<br>
chance is low, say 10%, that makes memes even more impatient than<br>
genes, who have a 50/50 chance of living on in each child.  <br>
