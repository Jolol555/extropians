I actually find it sad when 'money' is looked down upon.  It is the <br>
singular driving force througout history.  I suspect anyone who doesn't <br>
want 'more money'.  It is the means of obtaining that which you desire.  It <br>
is the means of doing that which you wish to do.  It is a far better way of <br>
doing so than to cut down acres of forest to plant a crop that you barter <br>
for the same end.<br>
<p>
Profit brings advance.<br>
<p>
When mining asteroids becomes profitable you'll see amazing advances in <br>
space travel.  Why?  Because you won't go broke developing a better way.<br>
<p>
I'm tired of bashing the rich.  Heck, I wish I were one.  Only when you <br>
make so much money that it doesn't matter will you not mind losing money on <br>
an idea that doesn't prove correct.  IBM made billions on the ideas of it's <br>
pure research that only came to fruit years later (mostly by tapping some <br>
poor bloke on the shoulder who tried to patent something and say 'Ahem, <br>
sorry, WE did that years ago.  There's a market now and WE will exploit <br>
it.'  How?  It could afford pure research.  Combine ambition with desire <br>
with talent with money.  An unbeatable combination.  SOMEBODY HAS to have <br>
the wear-withall to finance the others.<br>
<p>
When there is a market for an idea, the idea makes money.  You can't <br>
develop a cold-fusion reactor unless you can afford to develop and build <br>
one, and no one is going to become homeless hoping to do so.<br>
<p>
Perhaps in a 'Star Trek' future when some folk are happy to take your <br>
filthy stinky trash to the disposal for nothing because they can live in a <br>
mansion as big as the person happy to run an interplanetary conglomerate <br>
because anyone can get it for free because there is no money   (but there <br>
is in the rest of the galaxy so I'm REALLY stumped),  but not in today's <br>
reality.<br>
<p>
Anyway, who says you have to be poor to be famous, feel thrill in your <br>
achievement, or proud of your accomplishment?<br>
