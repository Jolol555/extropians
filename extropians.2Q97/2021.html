<p>
When I say it is "the information processed that counts" I don't mean<br>
its quantity but its quality. That's the difference.<br>
<p>
Communicating with others is not actually necessary in the sense that<br>
THEY have to hear YOU. It's enough if you listen.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't understand the part where you seem to be insisting that</i><br>
<i>&gt; money and trade are not modes of communication. It's obvious to me</i><br>
<i>&gt; that these are indispensable modes of communication.</i><br>
<p>
Posthuman entities, if there are several ones and no collective (whereas<br>
I consider the latter possibility as more likely) will need to talk to<br>
each other to get results. But they will not demand money for them,<br>
because whenever they give knowledge, they don't lose it.<br>
<p>
When I give you an apple, I don't have the apple anymore. But when I<br>
tell you about the principles of quantum mechanics (for instance) I<br>
don't lose anything but I can only win (from a universal viewpoint: the<br>
more people know about it, the more probable it is that new discoveries<br>
will be made soon). That's why trade in the sense of "give and take"<br>
loses its value.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  &gt; Not infinite power, but infinite knowledge is probably the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; purpose of any such entity.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Can you explain to us what the difference between these two</i><br>
<i>&gt; things is? Or are you engaging in empty rhetoric?</i><br>
<p>
It's not just rhetorics. When I want to achieve power, I usually measure<br>
my goal with what I know _now_. For example, "I want to rule the world".<br>
And when I want to achieve power I usually don't want to possess it, but<br>
to USE it -- against other people, other entities or whatever. This<br>
seems entirely unlikely to me for a posthuman behaviour, for it destroys<br>
valuable information sources.<br>
<p>
When I want to achieve knowledge, I want to know things I don't already<br>
know. I want to find NEW things. And I want to possess knowledge, not<br>
for the use against others, just for the possession in itself.<br>
