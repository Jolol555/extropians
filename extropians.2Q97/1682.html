Not necessarily. Most objects are highly redundant (order usually<br>
means that the object can be described succintly, chaos is hard to<br>
describe), which means you can optimize the simulation a lot.<br>
Besides, if your simulation has a lowest scale, a computer using<br>
scales below it could easily be smaller. <br>

<p>
But what is "every detail"? Every neural network? Every neuron? Every<br>
synapse? Every ion channel? Every atom? Every quantum? If it turns<br>
out that it is enough to simulate ever synapse, then we could likely<br>
build a nanocomputer that is smaller. Quantum computing might even<br>
make it possible to do some atomic scale simulations in a smaller<br>
space if we are lucky and clever. <br>
<p>
My personal guess is that we will need roughly the synaptic level of<br>
detail; ion channels are practically identical (a kind of<br>
nanodevices really) and can likely be handled statistically, if atoms<br>
were important we would have a trouble with them wandering around the<br>
whole place, and quantum effects are best left to the Church of the<br>
Holy Trinity of Penrose, Hameroff and Sarfatti. :-)<br>
