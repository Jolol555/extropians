<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I can't talk for Extropians, but I can talk for myself. And I know</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;that economy and free markets is what makes those people poor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Some facts are so simple and obvious that somehow they get</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; overlooked.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Free markets and economies don't make poor children.  Parents do.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Conclusion: Make those powerful guys cleverer, and they'll recognize</i><br>
<i>&gt; that making the everone else cleverer, too, will be to their own benefit</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the long term. That's all you need. No communism (any communist</i><br>
<i>&gt; movement is crushed in its roots, whether by media propaganda or by</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons power), no free markets and no dictatorships (whereas these two</i><br>
<i>&gt; are actually the same).</i><br>
<p>
The rest of the post is littered with economic fallacies (mainly that<br>
corporations are more concerned about power than money) but this is the<br>
paragraph that I think deserves the most dissection.<br>
<p>
A society without dictatorships (or more generally, coercion) is a free<br>
market.  How do you propose to educate these "powerful guys"?  Persuasive<br>
argument or at the end of a gun?  One is the free market and the other is<br>
government.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe I just want the same thing you do:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Make this world a better place. </i><br>
<p>
The temptation to sarcasm is great but I shall resist.  Nobody on this list<br>
is evil.  There are some who are stupid and ignorant but nobody sets out to<br>
do deliberate harm.  This can be said of most people in the population. <br>
How many people do you know who go around saying "My goal in life is to<br>
make the world a horrible place to live,"?  There are many who have that<br>
effect but most would say that making the world a better place is a worthy<br>
goal.<br>
