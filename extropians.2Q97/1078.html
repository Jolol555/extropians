In a message dated 97-05-10 13:58:43 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
&lt;&lt; Note that your model of a purely rational person has no "good reason"<br>
 to want a persian carpet, or a fine painting on their wall -- and yet<br>
 many people do want these sorts of things. Not all rational desires<br>
 may be explained in purely functional terms.<br>
 <br>

I agree about the need for clothing in certain wheather conditions, and if<br>
someone wishes to wear them as a form of "art", then that's fine too.  I<br>
think there may be many people who are more function oriented, who will<br>
prefer not to wear clothes during the times when there is no apparent reason<br>
to.  Concerning the "art" issue, in many tribal cultures, it is "normal" and<br>
"artistic" to wear either rings around the neck (stretching the neck in the<br>
process), or to cut slits in the lower lip, and inserting a "plate" into it,<br>
gradually stretching the skin more, and inserting a larger "plate".  I think<br>
wearing clothing for "art" could be looked at in a way, as we would look at<br>
these tribal people's "art".  I must admit, I am very funtional oriented.  I<br>
like art too, but I pay cash for that which is useful in some way.  The more<br>
useful, the more valuable.  Things of no real use, but are "rare" and demand<br>
large amounts of money, I believe is an artificial augmentation of value.  An<br>
old rare coin, a Renoir painting, and an ancient book could all be reproduced<br>
for a small fraction of the price of the original, and with molecular<br>
duplication techniques that will come about "soon", I would not recommend<br>
investing in these kinds of things now.  Like in the duplication chamber<br>
idea, "If there is no difference between two things, they are essentially the<br>
same thing."  Any comments?<br>
