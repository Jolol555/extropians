<i>&gt;      There is no such thing as "enough" or "plenty"; they are menaingless </i><br>
<i>&gt;      abstractions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      *Enough* is when you aren't devoting energy to a particular goal or </i><br>
<i>&gt;      desire.  As in full or satiated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      *Plenty* is when you can comfortably/benevolently redirect your focus </i><br>
<i>&gt;      and consider the needs/desires of others or embellish/expand your own. </i><br>
<i>&gt;       As in comfort or even abundance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      I have applied meaning to your absolutist assertion of no meaning and </i><br>
<i>&gt;      request that you devote a modicum of time/energy to address Mr. </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Wiser's question with some respect and consideration.  Otherwise, it </i><br>
<i>&gt;      would be more beneficial to simply refrain because credibility </i><br>
<i>&gt;      expressed in the motif you've chosen is seriously lacking.</i><br>
<p>
The topic was money.  The word "enough" is certainly useful when<br>
talking about things that can be satiated, like food or sex, or<br>
things that have physical limits (the speed of light is fast enough).<br>
But when the subject is money, I continue to assert that "enough"<br>
cannot be meaningfully applied, because money is by definition that<br>
which one uses to satisfy one's goals, and there is no limit to<br>
goals except failure of imagination.<br>
<p>
I answered the questions put honestly, meaningfully, and with some<br>
effort put into the ideas and wording.  If you think otherwise,<br>
then please provide evidence or refrain from making baseless<br>
accusations.  If you want to attack the ideas, I welcome that,<br>
but to attack my motives shows that your reasoning is too weak to<br>
stand on its own.<br>
