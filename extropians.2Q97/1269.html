Index funds will only remain a good choice for the next couple years and<br>
for the really long term.  Broader funds, especially ones that represent<br>
international markets, would be better choices for the medium-term.  For<br>
mutual funds, I prefer ones that do not track a particular index, but you<br>
have to shop more carefully to get good results.<br>

Not to burst your bubble, but after trading costs, you pretty much tracked<br>
the market indices for the same period.  Also, diversification is important<br>
to reliable growth and lowering risk.<br>
