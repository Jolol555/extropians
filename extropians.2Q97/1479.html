Decrease in unemployment rates may also contribute to it,<br>
as crime provides both an alternative source of income and<br>
alternative way to spend time to those unemployed.<br>
<p>
Also, I wonder what happened with the price of drugs in the<br>
last few years.  As some of the crimes are connected to<br>
people's attempts to support their drug habits, a fall in<br>
drug prices (or slowdown in their growth) could decrease<br>
the need to earn money via crime. - That would be the result<br>
of *failure* of FBI to fight drugs.  Or maybe drug use shifted<br>
to less dangerous substances.<br>
<p>
Or young males could shift to some other activities, such as<br>
playing videogames, going to raves, enjoying net.porn (all of<br>
these were not so widely available a few years ago), or<br>
committing non-violent frauds in the increasingly virtual<br>
environment.<br>
<p>
I would expect that there should be a number of good theories<br>
explaining the events.  Does anybody know of any?<br>
