&lt;However, there is another way to suppress an invention: licence the <br>
patent, and then don't manufacture it.  This is entirely legal, though <br>
people don't tend to talk about it, as it is anti-social. Does anyone <br>
know of a time when this has definitely happened?&gt;<br>

There was an front-page article in the Wall Street Journal, either <br>
this month or last, about a man who has made millions doing just what <br>
you describe.  It discussed many of his tricks, such as scouring <br>
scientific journals for info and then patenting something vague or <br>
general related to a technology that looks promising.  Precisely <br>
because his patents are so vague, they lurk, semi-approved, in the <br>
system for years.  Of course, he never bothers develop the invention, <br>
but waits until some other company does and then his lawyers pounce <br>
with claims of patent infringement.  As I said, he has gotten quite <br>
rich playing this game!<br>
