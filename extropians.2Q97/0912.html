<i>        &gt;Education _is_ a real problem. Not only education of the poor, but         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;also education of those who are able to buy whole universities.   </i><br>
           <br>
<p>
This is unclear. Are you saying that even the rich will be uneducated and <br>
will just buy a diploma? Or are you saying that if we can't give the poor a <br>
good education we should give everyone a bad education? Or are you just <br>
talking in riddles?<br>
             <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Money means power</i><br>
        <br>
Yes.  <br>
       <br>
<i>        &gt;and in a world where some people are much richer than others,         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;you will always have explicit power structures.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Unless every human on Earth dies or goes into a comma, power will exist.  <br>
Power that is chaotic destroys everything around it, so power that lasts any <br>
length of time is always organized. So when something is organized it has a <br>
structure, so we will always have explicit power structures, so what is your <br>
point?<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Decisions of today are made by this power elite. </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Not everyone makes important decisions, so those that do are an elite, <br>
so decisions of today are made by a power elite, so what is your point?<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;it's those economic rulers, investment banks [...] They WANT         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;government. Government is an easy way to get money (taxes) and to         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;invest it the way they want. </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
True. As I've said before whenever there is a proposal to deregulate an <br>
industry the strongest opposition always come from the industry itself.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Government therefore doesn't only (or does hardly) do "clever"         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;investments. Pushing weapons industry, for example, always helps big         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;companies to grow bigger and to crush smaller companies, for it         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;doesn't raise the life standard.</i><br>
               <br>
<p>
True again, and be advocating even more government you'd be playing right <br>
into their hands.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Remove government and you get a dictatorship of banks / monopolies. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Huh? That is the exact opposite of what you said just one sentence before.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Freedom? You'll be so free, you'll want to buy a whole load of guns         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;in order to defend yourself from street thugs. </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Naturally, nothing is free. There will always be street thugs and I will <br>
always want to be protected from them.  Today the government says they and <br>
only they may offer this protection, they tell me how much protection I will <br>
get and how many of their guns I must pay for. It makes no difference if I <br>
think others could protect me better, I must give my business to the <br>
government or I go to jail, or worse. I'd like to go to a competitor but <br>
government makes me an offer I can't refuse.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;any communist movement is crushed in its roots, whether by media         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;propaganda </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It is well known that the only fault of communism was that it allowed total <br>
freedom of the press and they were far too tolerant of those who disagreed <br>
with them. Stalin only killed 20 million of his own people, if he'd shoved 40 <br>
or 50 million into ovens everything would have been perfect. Next time, <br>
no more Mr. Nice Guy.  <br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;no free markets and no dictatorships (whereas these two are actually         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the same).</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You have something to sell at a price I'm willing to pay and no third party  <br>
is forcing us to do anything. Appalling! Totalitarian! Pure dictatorship!<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I advocate efforts to help the poor. </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
A noble aim, but if most people agree with you then why do we need government? <br>
If most people don't agree with you then how will government help?<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I'm working hard to prove it. Maybe in about 3 or 4 months, maybe in         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;a year, I can give you a fully documented analysis of the effects of         </i><br>
<i>        &gt;economic liberation (and economy &amp; freedom in general). </i><br>
               <br>
<p>
Erik, that doesn't sound very scientific. You've already reached your <br>
conclusion, now you just need the evidence. If you're bound and determined to <br>
obtain evidence to support you viewpoint I can guarantee you that is exactly <br>
what you will find, and it doesn't matter in the slightest what that <br>
viewpoint is.<br>
               <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;I find it amusing that certain beliefs must not be questioned on the        </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Extropian mailing list. </i><br>
<p>
<p>
It's just that most think the Extropian mailing list is no place for<br>
Extropy 101, an idea I disagree with by the way.<br>
