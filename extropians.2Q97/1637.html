<i>&gt; &gt; Max, In case you haven't yet seen this, Extropians are listed as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; cult on several resources, including one web site and one print book. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; I didn't think much of it because I thought that someone had seen it, </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; and I don't remember the name of the book now, but it's getting </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; around. Some sort of directory of groups.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  How is cult defined, anyway? A group sharing a common set of beliefs </i><br>
<i>&gt;  noticeably different than those of the average Joe? Then I'd guess we are </i><br>
<i>&gt;  a cult. (Hey, who will be passing around special kool-aid at Extro3 ?)</i><br>
<p>
English internet magazine .net featured extropians in an article called 'net<br>
cults'.  However, they did start by saying "These guys are completely<br>
different to other internet cults" and ended with "It's scientific,<br>
rigorously logical, and nerdish - in other words, a world apart from the<br>
spiritualists and cyberprophets inhabiting the fringes of the Net."<br>
<p>
So, when's the next comet !?<br>
