Hmm, how is this Anarchy?  If the basic idea of Anarchy is individuals <br>
acting largely free of government coercion, what you had in Europe prior <br>
to WW1 were millions of people controlled by governments that were not even<br>
democratic.  Seems way off the mark.   Your point seems to be <br>
<p>
warring states = anarchy <br>
<p>
because both are political systems without laws.  But in fact this is a <br>
very poor analogy because most Anarchist philosophy is keyed off of the<br>
individual.  Classic examples of Anarchy would be Spain before Franco, <br>
France at points during the revolution, the situationist uprising there<br>
in '68, other TAZ, the internet, hippie communes, whatever.  But not<br>
the empires of 19th century Europe!  It was against these very <br>
institutions that classical Anarchy was formulated.  <br>
<p>
If you want to talk about groups in relation why not American<br>
Indidan tribes prior to the arrival of Europeans?  At least there individuals<br>
were free to wander off if they didn't like the chief, a privilege almost<br>
never given by nation states to their citizens (prisoners). <br>
