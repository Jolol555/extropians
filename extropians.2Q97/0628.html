<i>&gt; From: Frank Mcelligott &lt;Frankmac@ripco.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Recently, last week suffered a heart attack, product of smoking two</i><br>
<i>&gt; packs a day for forty years. Have survided both the attack and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; medical system.  Would ask your help in where do I go from here, all</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggestions</i><br>
<i>&gt; and I mean all will be greatlyand humbly accepted.</i><br>
<p>
1) Obviously, the first step is to quit smoking. If you do so, in a<br>
   few years your risk of cancers and heart disease will dramatically<br>
   fall, although not quite as low as it might if you had never<br>
   smoked.<br>
2) Your second big risk factor is diet. Dean Ornish's studies show<br>
   that moving to a low fat vegan diet is one of the few documented<br>
   ways of reversing the progress of heart disease.<br>
3) Various and sundry antioxidants, especially Vitamin E, have been<br>
   shown to have beneficial effects in the long term, although I have<br>
   no idea if the literature has any evidence for what their impact<br>
   might be on someone who is already suffering from heart disease.<br>
4) Moderate exercise is also in order, according to the experts.<br>
<p>
and finally,<br>
<p>
5) Have you made cryonics arrangements for yourself yet?<br>
<p>
