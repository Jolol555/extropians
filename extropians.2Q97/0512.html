Surely not if there is a cammandeering force, in reality.<br>
<p>

Parents seem to have such narrow reality tunnels.<br>

If you define god as 'one who takes responsibility', yes. But what about a<br>
god who is 'just there' and is just a positive force for good?<br>
<p>

<p>
Praying, to me, is not about unburdoning (confession maybe!). It is about<br>
magick and a way of concretizing ones will, which can be a psychological<br>
trigger or catalyst. I don't pray anymore, I prefer to cast spells as it<br>
fits me fondess of esoterica and it messes with people's heads, but<br>
praying and magick and psychological therapy are all basically the same,<br>
it's also all NLP and metaprogramming at the end of the day.<br>
<p>
And if you believe in metaprogramming, why not a god who is beyond where<br>
you are at at the moment? It is a good metametaphor.<br>
