Hi Natasha,<br>
     I would like to go to Mexico, and if you need me to pick up something,<br>
it will give me all the more reason to go.  If it's just over the boarder, I<br>
may go next weekend, or at least very "soon".  If you need my assistance,<br>
just let me know.  You could also leave a voicemail at (818) 810-3228, if you<br>
wish.  Shawn<br>
<p>
P.S.  I didn't make it to the Extropian dinner this month, but I plan to make<br>
it next month.  Thanks.<br>
