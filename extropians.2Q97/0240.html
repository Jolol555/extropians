Michael Lorrey:<br>
<i>&gt;Rather the converse, when a male term is used to describe a woman, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;typically is a sign of respect of one sort or another, with the possible</i><br>
<i>&gt;conditional exception of "butch".</i><br>
<p>
An interesting point, thank you for bringing that up.  It doesn't <br>
contradict my original point, however, which is that the vast <br>
majority of insults thrown at men referent the female.  The two <br>
points complement each other.  Both are symptoms of our highly <br>
divisive gender power structure that pits males and females against <br>
each other rather than bringing them together for mutual growth.<br>
<p>
Also enjoyed reading Geoff Cobb's comments, and the additional word <br>
suggestions (have we violated any community standards yet?).  As for <br>
Tony's rants, they evidence that he has not read most of what I post <br>
here, so I'll just wait for such time as he catches up to my <br>
post-feminist ouvre to converse with him.<br>

Sin,<br>
