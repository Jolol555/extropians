It would be prudent to mention that small quantities of fat are required<br>
for the proper absorption of some minerals.  Dairy fats are an example of<br>
this.  Calcium is poorly absorbed when it is not mixed with small<br>
quantities of appropriate types of fat.  Dairy fats are well-suited for<br>
this role (surprise!) which is one of the reasons it is often better to<br>
drink 1-2% lowfat milk than non-fat.  I have a relative who was a strict<br>
vegan, but was required by her doctor to ingest small quantities of dairy<br>
fats because her body could not adequately absorbing the calcium she was<br>
ingesting both as supplements and in her food.  She started drinking lowfat<br>
milk which subsequently fixed the problem.<br>
<p>
There are a few other minerals which are also require minimal amounts of<br>
fat for maximum effectiveness.  Fatty molecules serve many useful purposes<br>
in the body and are a required part of the diet.  The real question isn't<br>
if you should ingest fat, it is what is an appropriate quantity and what<br>
types.  The "all fat is bad" meme is incorrect, or at least misleading.<br>
