Damien Broderick wrote 6/14/97: &lt;Thanks to Reilly for a detailed and<br>
thought-provoking response.  Writers *live* for this kind of reaction...&gt;=<br>
<p>
<p>
&lt;chuckle&gt;  A few writers do, perhaps...<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;Yes, Keith read my manuscript and made nice comments about it. =<br>
<p>
The first half of the book is precisely about the pathologies of<br>
fashionable academic silliness.  It might be that my own diffidently<br>
presented discursive model is just as silly.  But I don't think it's<br>
*obviously* so.&gt;<br>
<p>
Considering what Keith has written about academic quasi-deterministic<br>
formulations of history, I doubt very much that he would agree with your<br>
"diffidently presented discursive model."  However, if you have done a<br>
passable job on the pathologies of academic silliness, I'm sure he would<br>
welcome it.  I fully agree that your model is not *obviously* silly,<br>
otherwise, books in this genre (such as "The Fourth Turning") would not<br>
sell so well to "gullible aging yuppies with the narcissistic urge to rea=<br>
d<br>
about their life, have their palms read and have money to waste."<br>
<p>
Much discussion on the E-list over time has centered on rational<br>
decision-making methods, such as game theory, Bayesian theory, risk-rewar=<br>
d<br>
matrices, etc., and why the benighted public makes clueless decisions so<br>
frequently when all these fancy tools are available.  Logical fallacies a=<br>
re<br>
frequently subtle, especially when statistics are involved.  The category=<br>
<p>
error in analysis I mentioned is subtle, yet pervasive.  Individuals who<br>
desire to forecast the future, are inherently self-centered, and are quit=<br>
e<br>
often blind to my dictum that when examining human history "no year is to=<br>
<p>
be given a privileged position when starting a cyclical analysis."<br>
<p>
One of the greatest of academic pathologies is presenting models<br>
"diffidently."  The lack of seriousness among academics and intellectuals=<br>
<p>
today is soul-quenching.  Ninnies like the French compost-modernists with=<br>
<p>
all their "play" and "games" are sickly, and noodleheads like Richard<br>
Rorty, a self-described "liberal ironist," are delusional.  As Roger<br>
Kimball notes, the problem with liberal ironists (e.g., the diffident<br>
academics), is that "they are ironical about everything except their own<br>
irony, and are serious about tolerating everything except seriousness."<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;Communication is usually dialogical, as in this list (as in<br>
this reply).  Even novelists and poets who write in their silent rooms an=<br>
d<br>
fling out messages in bottles get responses back, however mediated, and<br>
those responses help shape their further utterance.  The point I was tryi=<br>
ng<br>
to make is that communication is reciprocal, even when the reciprocity is=<br>
<p>
masked or suppressed...&gt;<br>
<p>
The reciprocity, or loop, or feedback, whatever you wish to call it, does=<br>
<p>
not portend cyclicality in history in any way, shape or form.  A writer's=<br>
<p>
(or speaker's) words go out, they are sent one-way.  They cannot be taken=<br>
<p>
back, they cannot be changed, they are launched at a particular place, at=<br>
 a<br>
particular time, never to return or recur, never to be modified or altere=<br>
d<br>
at all.  It is entirely up to individual readers to accept a writer's<br>
modifications, clarifications, retractions, etc. of previously written<br>
words.  The writer has no part in this.  There is no loop, no continuity,=<br>
<p>
no recurrence.  Responses helping to shape further utterances do not in a=<br>
ny<br>
way, modify previous utterances, every utterance is made by a unique<br>
individual at a unique point in time, and hangs there solid and whole<br>
forever.  If it difficult to see this, think of how long dead writers sti=<br>
ll<br>
can speak to us, with no reciprocity, no mediation, no dialogue at all. =<br>
<p>
Think of Nietzsche's idea of "communication" in "Untimely Meditations"<br>
where "one giant calls to another across the desert intervals of time and=<br>
,<br>
undisturbed by the chattering dwarfs who creep about beneath them, the<br>
exalted spirit-dialogue goes on."<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;Individuals make history and individuals never recur, so why should<br>
history recur?&gt;<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;My reference to Toynbee's punctuations by war is a hint, surely?=<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
This is the reference to Toynbee:  "Arnold Toynbee famously found in this=<br>
<p>
unhappy recurrence a key to alternations between war and peace: `the<br>
survivors of a generation that has been of military age during a bout of<br>
war will be shy, for the rest of their lives, of bringing a repetition of=<br>
<p>
this tragic experience either upon themselves or their children' (A Study=<br>
<p>
of History, Vol. IX)."<br>
<p>
First of all, Toynbee's statement is complete balderdash on the face of i=<br>
t,<br>
as Toynbee knew well.  The instances of war-like conditions extending ove=<br>
r<br>
multiple generations within a given society are so numerous, they could<br>
fill volumes by themselves.  I'm sure Toynbee ran across the Spartans, fo=<br>
r<br>
the most famous instance, somewhere in his studies.  The question is, why=<br>
<p>
would Toynbee publish what he knew to be a big, fat whopper?  The answer<br>
can be seen by filtering through the following passages from Arthur<br>
Herman's "The Idea of Decline in Western History" (1997):<br>
<p>
First, Herman presents some background on the cultural milieu of the<br>
English ruling elite that Toynbee was born into:  "The liberal optimism o=<br>
f<br>
the early Victorians had been evaporating long before Toynbee was born. =<br>
<p>
This was due in large part to the degeneration scare, which had cast<br>
serious doubt on the future of civil society in the industrial age.  If t=<br>
he<br>
fear of degeneration had driven English liberalism into retreat, then the=<br>
<p>
trauma of World War I completed the rout.  In the minds of interwar Briti=<br>
sh<br>
intellectuals, their nation and the modern West were summed up in the tit=<br>
le<br>
of T.S. Eliot's famous poem:  "The Waste Land."  Some turned to Marxism t=<br>
o<br>
create a new social order; a few others, like the artist Wyndham Lewis an=<br>
d<br>
the novelist D.H. Lawrence, turned to an irrational vitalism bordering on=<br>
<p>
fascism.  But Toynbee and many of his generation turned to another<br>
alternative, which flowed out of the New Liberalism of the later Victoria=<br>
ns<br>
and its postliberal assumptions.  Instead of demolishing the West, they<br>
would refurbish it as a community of shared moral values, what the<br>
Enlightenment would have termed 'polite' values.  Tolerance, compassion,<br>
humanitarian concern, and reasonable compromise would define this new<br>
Western civilization; its chief virtues would have a spiritual rather tha=<br>
n<br>
a material basis.  However, this kinder, gentler West would establish in<br>
effect a new universal empire of peace and harmony, with its humane,<br>
civilized values serving as the basis for a world government and unity<br>
among peoples everywhere.  This pacific new vision for the modern West<br>
proved to be immensely influential, and not only in England.  It dominate=<br>
s<br>
the geopolitical outlook of modern liberals to this very day."<br>
<p>
This pacifistic utopianism shares the fatal ideological presupposition th=<br>
at<br>
mankind is inherently good.  Fatal because:<br>
<p>
Herman: "Renouncing force and violence became a moral imperative for the<br>
heirs of liberal humanism....  From appeasement and the League of Nations=<br>
,<br>
to the Committee for Nuclear Disarmament and the Euromissile protests of<br>
the 1980s, twentieth-century liberalism proved more adept at encouraging<br>
its enemies than at protecting those it claimed to represent."<br>
<p>
Now, as to why Toynbee would tell such a whopper:<br>
<p>
Herman: "In terms of sheer numbers =AD 702, 410 dead =AD Great Britain su=<br>
ffered<br>
no more in World War I than Italy.  But Britain's casualties were<br>
disproportionately drawn from society's elite:  one third of the Oxford<br>
class of 1913 died in the war, and the death of many promising young<br>
Balliol men cast a pall over the British establishment.  Out of the shock=<br>
<p>
and sense of loss would emerge the myth of the 'lost generation,' which<br>
haunted British intellectual culture and policy-making for the next two<br>
decades.  World War I was for Great Britain what Vietnam would be for<br>
America, the breaking of the morale of its political elite.  Among those<br>
broken was Arnold Toynbee.  Yet Toynbee managed to escape the ordeal<br>
unscathed.  Although he initially supported 'the war for civilization,' h=<br>
is<br>
mother's encouragement and the help of influential family friends enabled=<br>
<p>
Toynbee to evade service witha trumped up medical deferment.  Guilt over<br>
his compromised position plagued Toynbee for the rest of his life.  Almos=<br>
t<br>
as if in reaction, he became a committed pacifist who detested everything=<br>
<p>
smacking of military value, heroism, patriotism, or other 'antiquated'<br>
notions of the prewar Victorian past.  'In 1914,' he wrote long afterward=<br>
s,<br>
'I became convinced that war was neither a respectable institution nor a<br>
venial sin, but was a crime.'  In January 1918 Virginia and Leonard Woolf=<br>
<p>
had dinner with Toynbee, and Virginia noted afterwards that he 'knew the<br>
aristocratic heroes who are now all killed and celebrated, and loathed<br>
them.'"<br>
<p>
I just love armchair psychology as a spectator sport, especially when it<br>
has the ring of truth about it.<br>
<p>
Herman: "Now, after the experience of the Great War, the New Liberal<br>
consensus asserted that the nation-state, too, would have to disappear,<br>
along with its war-making powers.... [B]y shedding absurd claims of<br>
national sovereignty and joining with other nations to promote peace, the=<br>
y<br>
could concentrate on their primary duty:  feeding, clothing, and elevatin=<br>
g<br>
the lives of their own citizens....  Military victory was always for<br>
Toynbee certain proof of moral deficiency:  he suggested that, had Americ=<br>
a<br>
and Israel lost some wars rather than continually winning them, it might<br>
have been better for their souls....  He made himself the new prophet of<br>
the demise of Western civilization in its modern (especially American) mo=<br>
de<br>
and of a new spiritual stirring in the non-Western world that promised a<br>
future of universal peace and social justice.  '...Mankind must become on=<br>
e<br>
family or destroy itself.'  Privately he added, 'One has to admit history=<br>
<p>
is against us....  I can't think of a single case of the cooperative meth=<br>
od<br>
having done the trick.'  But in Toynbee's perspective... being good was<br>
more important than doing good.  It was one's intentions, not the results=<br>
,<br>
that ultimately counted most.  In a politically unified world, these<br>
various faiths would inevitably merge into an ecumenical religion of love=<br>
,<br>
which would teach compassion and tolerance for diversity =AD the sort of<br>
agenda later adopted by liberal religious groups such as the World Counci=<br>
l<br>
of Churches."<br>
<p>
Yuck!  An all-around bad guy.  He told a whopper in Damien's quote becaus=<br>
e<br>
he wanted to discourage war, ultimately through One World Government<br>
dominated by non-Western peaceniks.<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;We are now living through the exhausted stage of an American<br>
century.&gt;<br>
<p>
RJ: &lt;"Exhausted stage"?  Is this an empirical statement of fact, or might=<br>
<p>
it be a bit of chafing over Australia being off the radar screen when it<br>
comes to current superpower status?&gt;<br>
<p>
Damien: &lt;Ah, the gratuitous ad hominem surfaces.  I don't much like<br>
superpowers, as it happens, so I'm not chafing.  More to the point, the<br>
cited passage is not me speaking as such but me summarizing the Modelskia=<br>
n<br>
theory of long cycles under discussion.&gt;<br>
<p>
I'm sorry, but I simply fail to see the gratuitous ad hominem here.  I am=<br>
<p>
questioning your motivation to characterize America as "exhausted." =<br>
<p>
America as a superpower is the only guarantor of the very notions of<br>
"liberty and justice" as they have been formulated within the traditions =<br>
of<br>
Western civilization.  The notions themselves would likely disappear off<br>
the face of the earth, if Americans fall asleep.  It is dangerous in the<br>
sense of promoting a self-fulfilling prophecy, to encourage the idea that=<br>
<p>
America is "exhausted."  There is no other guarantor on the horizon.  Thi=<br>
s<br>
dislike of superpowers, America being the one only around, is part and<br>
parcel of modern liberalism's ideology, which, in Herman's phrase, is "mo=<br>
re<br>
adept at encouraging its enemies than at protecting those it claimed to<br>
represent."  You say the cited passage is not you speaking, yet I can't s=<br>
ee<br>
that you have distanced yourself from it either in the original post or i=<br>
n<br>
your follow-up.  Indeed, your expressed dislike of superpowers, meaning<br>
America, even if it is a "diffident" dislike, draws you closer to the cit=<br>
ed<br>
passage, not away.  Be diffidently charitable with me, please don't confu=<br>
se<br>
my armchair psychology with bad old ad hominem's.<br>
