Fuel cells are cold, non-Carnot devices, they thus have exceedingly high <br>
efficiencies. They differ from other electrochemical batteries by using <br>
atmospheric air for one electrode, vastly reducing weight. Though one of <br>
the first electrochemical effects observed, fuel cells have been <br>
languishing in obscurity (why?) until quite recently on-board fuel <br>
reforming and PEM electrolyte invigorated the concept. Though platinum <br>
metal content has been reduced drastically, fuel cell, if mainstream, are <br>
thought to increase platiunum metal prices do to enourmous demand. <br>
Direct methanol-metabolizing fuel cells might make NiMH and <br>
lithium-ion/polymer obsolete for powering portable devices. Recharging <br>
could be done in seconds, by refilling the liquid fuel.<br>

     Ballard And Daimler-Benz To Invest Over $450 Million In Fuel Cell<br>
     Ventures To Develop The Next Generation Of Engines For The World's<br>
     Automobiles<br>
<p>
     VANCOUVER/STUTTGART, April 14 /CNW-PRN/ - Ballard Power Systems Inc. of<br>
Canada and Daimler-Benz AG of Germany announced today that they are combining<br>
forces and jointly investing over $450 million in fuel cell ventures to<br>
develop the next generation of efficient and clean engines for the world's<br>
automobiles using Ballard Fuel Cells. The two companies signed a detailed<br>
memorandum of understanding which will result in the alliance of Ballard, the<br>
world leader in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, with Daimler-Benz, the<br>
quality and innovation leader in the automotive industry.<br>
     Ballard Fuel Cells are electrochemical devices which convert a fuel, such<br>
as methanol, natural gas or hydrogen into usable electricity, directly without<br>
combustion. Surrounding a fuel cell is a system which consists of a fuel<br>
processor, air supply subsystem, cooling subsystem and controls. Combining<br>
these subsystems with the fuel cell creates a fuel cell engine which can power<br>
a car, truck, bus or other vehicle.<br>
     In the proposed transaction, Daimler-Benz will invest a total of $198<br>
million in Ballard by contributing all of its fuel cell stack technology,<br>
related fixed assets and $142 million in cash to Ballard in return for<br>
5,653,664 new treasury shares of Ballard at a price of $35 per share which<br>
will constitute 25% of Ballard's outstanding shares after the investment. In<br>
addition, Daimler-Benz will invest a total of $207 million made up of all of<br>
its fuel cell system technology, related fixed assets and $57 million in cash<br>
into a new fuel cell engine company which will develop and commercialize fuel<br>
cell systems to be supplied to the world's automotive industry as the engines<br>
for tomorrow's automobiles in return for two-thirds of this engine company.<br>
Ballard Power Systems will invest a total of $103 million made up of all of<br>
its vehicular fuel cell system technology, related fixed assets and cash of<br>
$53 million to the new fuel cell engine company for one-third ownership of the<br>
engine company. Ballard Power Systems will supply the fuel cell engine company<br>
with the fuel cells which will be integrated into fuel cell engines for sale.<br>
     In addition, Ballard Power Systems and the new engine company will<br>
jointly form a new company which will market all fuel cells for vehicular<br>
applications made by Ballard Power Systems and all fuel cell engines for<br>
vehicular applications made by the fuel cell engine company to all of the<br>
world's automobile, truck and bus manufacturers.<br>
     Ballard Power Systems and the new fuel cell engine company will together<br>
spend over $200 million over the next three years to develop and commercialize<br>
fuel cells and fuel cell engines for market introduction after the year 2000.<br>
     The transaction is subject to the approval of Ballard Power Systems'<br>
shareholders, which will be sought at the Company's annual general meeting on<br>
May 29, 1997, satisfactory completion of all formal agreements between the<br>
companies and the approval of regulatory authorities. Final completion of the<br>
transaction is expected to occur during the third quarter of 1997. Financial<br>
advisors to the Company on this transaction were Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.<br>
Incorporated of New York and Goepel Shields &amp; Partners Inc. of Vancouver.<br>
     "This relationship with Daimler-Benz is the most significant event to<br>
occur to date in Ballard's history. It will be a catalyst for the development<br>
of the next generation of clean and efficient automobiles, and will enable<br>
Ballard to become a major supplier of a key automotive component," said Firoz<br>
Rasul, Ballard's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We have successfully<br>
collaborated with Daimler-Benz over the past four years and, by joining<br>
forces, we can together build on our technological and market lead to provide<br>
the world automotive industry with cost effective fuel cells and fuel cell<br>
engines for use in their vehicles."<br>
     Daimler-Benz presented the first traffic-ready passenger car vehicle<br>
using fuel cell engine technology in 1994. At that time, the fuel cell system<br>
took up almost the entire cargo space of the van. Only two years later, the<br>
company launched a fuel cell car that had room for six people. The next goal<br>
is to integrate fuel cells into the recently introduced subcompact<br>
Mercedes-Benz A-Class in the near future.<br>
     Daimler-Benz chairman Juergen E. Schrempp sees this partnership as<br>
further proof of the company's continuous strive for progress through<br>
innovation. Observes Schrempp: "A provider of premium automobiles can<br>
distinguish itself from the competition only through outstanding technological<br>
achievements. The fuel cell is the only so-called "alternative engine" with<br>
the potential to harmonize mobility and environmental concerns. Through the<br>
intensified collaboration with Ballard, Daimler-Benz will further expand its<br>
technological lead."<br>
     Dr. Ferdinand Panik, Daimler-Benz Senior Vice President and head of the<br>
fuel cell project sees the fuel cell engine as "the alternative engine with<br>
the greatest chance of seriously competing with the combustion engine." He<br>
emphasizes: "Daimler-Benz wants to be the first to bring a production<br>
automobile with fuel-cell engine technology to the market and to develop a<br>
major business with Ballard to supply fuel cell engines to the world."<br>
     Daimler-Benz is the world's most comprehensive provider of<br>
technologically advanced transportation products, traffic systems and services<br>
and has 290,000 employees and revenues of approximately $70 billion.<br>
Daimler-Benz is focused on the development and manufacture of Mercedes-Benz<br>
cars and commercial vehicles, Freightliner trucks, rail systems, diesel<br>
engines and microelectronics. Daimler-Benz Aerospace builds aircraft and space<br>
systems and Daimler-Benz InterServices provides leasing and sales financing,<br>
mobile communications and information technologies. North America, where<br>
Daimler-Benz employs more than 18,000 people, is the largest regional market<br>
outside of Europe and accounts for approximately 20 percent of worldwide<br>
revenues. In 1993, Daimler-Benz became the first German company to list its<br>
stock on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: DAI).<br>
     Ballard Power Systems is the world leader in the development of proton<br>
exchange membrane fuel cells. At the heart of its products is the Ballard Fuel<br>
Cell, a proprietary zero-emission engine that converts natural gas, methanol,<br>
or hydrogen fuel into electricity without combustion. Ballard Fuel Cells are<br>
currently being used by leading international companies to develop<br>
zero-emission vehicles and clean stationary electric power generators.<br>
     Ballard's Common shares are listed on The Toronto Stock Exchange under<br>
the trading symbol "BLD" and on the Nasdaq National Market System under the<br>
symbol "BLDPF".<br>
