The hardest thing for me with a vegan diet is maintaining it whilst<br>
remaining sociable. Peer criticism was also harsher and harder to deal<br>
with than I ever imagined. The age old argument always surfaces; 'you are<br>
missing out on protein and vital nutrients'.<br>
<p>
Is there anything that a vegan is in danger of missing? Do I need to<br>
suppliment my diet, or are there naturally occuring provdiders?<br>

As far as Practical Exropianism goes:<br>
<p>
Nootropics<br>
<p>
I recomend Ginko Biloba (2x260mg twice a day). It stays in your system for<br>
6-8 hours and I have found that it greatly benefits cognition, memory,<br>
concentration etc. If not convinced, make a smart drink with 6x260mg and<br>
really notice the difference. I was flying all day and completed a several<br>
thousand word paper in 4 hours, the grade?, 96 per cent.<br>
<p>
Quitting smoking<br>
<p>
I found chewable vitamin C tablets to be a nice alternative. Every time I<br>
crave, I just pop a tab. Obviously the effects are totally different<br>
(completely opposite healthwise) but the tablet simply serves as a<br>
reminder of my commitment to move towards better health. Oh yeah, and<br>
drink plenty of water......<br>
<p>
<p>
be happy<br>
