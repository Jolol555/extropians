<h2>ALL SPACE IS <em>NOT</em> EQUAL: PHYSICISTS FIND AXIS THAT GIVES THE UNIVERSE ORIENTATION</h2><p>
<p><p>
<p><p>
<h4>April 17, 1997</h4><p><p>

     Physicists at the University of Rochester and the University of Kansas have found evidence that flies in the face
of the long-held belief that space is the same in all directions (isotropic). In fact, measurements indicate something
seldom considered by physicists: that the universe has an
orientation. The unexpected finding, determined by measuring the polarization of light as it travels to Earth from the
far reaches of the universe, is the subject of a paper in the
April 21 issue of <i>Physical Review Letters</i>.<p>

     The work, which may be one of the most fundamental findings about the universe in recent years, could affect
physicists' views about the birth of the universe and suggests that scientists will need to explore how Einstein's
theory of relativity and the theory of electromagnetism might explain the finding. That's quite an impact from an effect
so tiny that it's betrayed only by light traveling across most of the observable universe, from 15 billion years ago.
Physicists have dubbed the effect the "corkscrew effect" for the way it twists light crossing the heavens.<p>

     "The big news is that perhaps not all space is equal, for as far back as we can peer in time," says Borge Nodland
of the University of Rochester.<p>

     Adds co-investigator John Ralston of the University of Kansas: "The shocking thing about our result is that there
seems to be an absolute axis, a kind of cosmological north star that orients the universe. We don't really know yet what
this axis represents."<p>

     This axis of orientation is not a physical entity but rather defines a direction of space that somehow determines
how light travels through the universe. In effect, Ralston and Nodland have discovered a direction in space that is out
of the ordinary or different from all other directions. The idea that any direction of space is in any way "special" has
long been taboo among astrophysicists.<p>

     "This work defies the notion that there is no 'up' or 'down' in space," says Nodland, research fellow at
Rochester's Theory Center for Optical Science and Engineering.<p>

     From Earth, the axis of this orientation runs toward the constellation Sextans, roughly in the direction of Leo and
Gemini and high in the southern evening sky this time of year. The other end of the axis points toward the
constellations Aquila and Equuleus. (Stargazers, of course, will see nothing special when they look in that direction.)
Nodland and Ralston, a professor of physics and astronomy at Kansas, say the axis might have several interpretations: It
could be an intrinsic property of the universe, or it might indicate that an undiscovered particle, such as the long-
theorized axion, is at work.<p>

     The team made the finding by studying the polarization (orientation of electric fields) of radio waves from 160
distant galaxies as measured in previous experiments by
astronomers around the world. Nodland and Ralston found that the plane of polarization of the light rotates like a
corkscrew as the light travels through space, and that the orientation
of the universal axis that they've discovered is key to the amount of rotation. The rotation of polarization depends on
the angle at which the light moves relative to the axis and on the distance the light travels before being measured. The
effect is crudely analogous to that of a crystal that twists light depending on the direction light is traveling through
the crystal.<p>

     Astronomers have long known about a somewhat similar effect called the Faraday effect, which is caused by magnetic
fields between galaxies and causes the plane of polarization of light to rotate as the light travels through space. The
newly discovered effect is in addition to the Faraday effect.<p>

     Though the cause of the corkscrew effect remains unknown, in their paper the team constructs a mathematical theory
that explains the observations. The data indicate that light actually travels through space at two slightly different
speeds. Such a mismatch in speeds would cause the polarization plane to rotate in a well known manner, in a way that
physics students see when they pass light through corn syrup and look at the light with polarizing filters. This
corkscrew effect is far more subtle, though: Light traveling across the heavens undergoes one full rotation of its plane
of polarization about once in a billion years.<p>

     Whatever the cause, the work could have widespread
implications. Scientists have long theorized that the Big Bang was completely symmetric. Says Nodland: "Perhaps it was
not a perfect Big Bang, but a Big Bang with a twist to space and
time." Such a twist would be seen today as a ripple of
non-uniformity, perhaps as the axis (an "axis of anisotropy") represents.<p>

     Much more speculatively, the work may provide some of the first experimental evidence for physicists who have
theorized the existence of other universes. If our universe was asymmetric at creation, and symmetry in the cosmos is
maintained as many physicists believe, it raises the possibility of the simultaneous creation of another universe with
an opposite twist.<p>

     The work also seems to run counter to the notions that all space is uniform and that the speed of light in a vacuum
is always precisely the same, key assumptions of the theory of special relativity.<p>

     Though the researchers say there's only a few chances in a thousand that the result comes from statistical
fluctuations, they stress the need for other scientists to
confirm their results.<p>

     Questions about the universe and our role in it have
fascinated Nodland ever since he can remember, filling his
mind as he took long hikes while growing up in his native
Norway.<p>

     "I've always had a passionate interest in the universe and its origins," he says. "We're on a little planet going
around some burning mass that we call a sun, in a certain region of space. What is this space, and why are we here? The
universe is amazing, and I want to know the most I can about it."<p>

     The team's work is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, the New York State
Energy Research and Development Authority, and the Kansas Science and Technology Advanced Research (KSTAR) program.<p>
