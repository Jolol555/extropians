<p>
I came across two books today: a recent one (1997): "Head Mounted Display<br>
-- designing for the user", James E. Melzer &amp; Kirk Moffit, McGraw Hill,<br>
ISBN 0-07-041819-5. <br>
<p>
It is expensive, but has one intriguing, albeit brief, chapter in it: <br>
"Brain-Actuated Control (BAC) &amp; HMDs". Accurate, and in-depth. Almost<br>
bought it. Anyone interested in fringe GUIs should check it out. <br>
<p>
<p>
The other one (from 1991, or so) is to remain anonymous, as I haven't<br>
written up the title. It was about the role molecular modelling in<br>
investigation of cellular signalling, neurotransmitters/receptor<br>
interaction included. I was thinking ab initio upoading when leafing<br>
through it, but designing symbiontes from scratch is about as adequate in<br>
its scope. <br>
<p>
Talking about simulating cell development, and operation in a computer run<br>
is pretty ridiculous, nowadays. However, from HUGO data &amp; wet context we<br>
can progress very far, if we use stringent simulation validation by the<br>
underlying simulation layer, all the way up the overlapping systems<br>
ladder. (I think Nippon has a project with one of its many focuses on it<br>
now started. Nippon likes to spend lots of money on dumb projects, but I<br>
think this one is a good investment on their part). <br>
<p>
Even given our delicately prying experimental techiques, ab wet initio<br>
might provide us with crucial information unavailable from experimental<br>
data alone. We should definitely look into it. Imo.<br>
