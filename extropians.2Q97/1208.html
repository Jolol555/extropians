Looks like you're close.<br>
<p>
According to the Spring/Summer '97 special issue of Newsweek magazine <br>
which was recommended in an earlier message by Ray Peck (thanks, Ray, for <br>
the tip - this is a great introduction to the latest theories of how kids <br>
from 0 to 3 learn about the world around them!):<br>
<p>
"In a study published in February in the journal Neurological Research, <br>
scientists report how spatial-temporal reasoning in 3- and 4-year-olds <br>
was affected by weekly piano lessons.  After six months, the budding <br>
Horowitzes - all of whom scored at the national average on tests of <br>
spatial recognition - scored 34 percent above average on this reasoning <br>
skill.  None of the other children (who had received computer keyboard <br>
and mouse lessons, singing lessons or nothing at all) had improved.  What <br>
explains the effect?  Physicist Gordon Shaw of the University of <br>
California, Irvine, suspects that in playing the piano, "you are seeing <br>
tho patterns work in space and time."  When sequential finger and key <br>
patterns make melodies, neural circuits that connect positions (keys) to <br>
sounds in space and time (the melody) are strengthened.  "Music training <br>
produces long-term modifications in neural circuitry," says Shaw.  What <br>
scientists do not know is whether the effects of early music training <br>
endure - whether the preschoolers will be math wizards in high school."<br>
<p>
(Personal note - I studied the violin for 5 years and definitely did not <br>
turn out to be a math whiz.  Although at least some of that was probably <br>
because I didn't do a very good job of making myself do the homework...  <br>
As an aside, I find at times that I wish I could still play.)<br>
