Astronomer Alan Hale laments:<br>
&lt;Like I'm sure is true for many of you, I was inspired by the <br>
scientific discoveries and events taking place during my childhood to <br>
pursue a career in science only to find, after completing the rigors <br>
of undergraduate and graduate school, that the opportunities for us to <br>
have a career in science are limited at best and are which I usually <br>
describe as "abysmal." Based upon my own experiences, and those of you <br>
with whom I have discussed this issue, my personal feeling is that, <br>
unless there are some pretty drastic changes in the way that our <br>
society approaches science and treats those of us who have devoted our <br>
lives to making some of our own contributions, there is no way that I <br>
can, with a clear conscience, encourage present-day students to pursue <br>
a career in science.&gt;<br>
<p>
While an anecdotal survey of 'science career horror stories' would <br>
certainly be interesting, and might even be useful, I sense that Alan <br>
Hale is hoping that this could somehow be used to lobby for more <br>
government funding of the sciences.<br>
<p>
I can imagine a situation where, with the right type of marketing, a <br>
bumper-crop of astronomer and physicist wanna-be's could be produced <br>
for which there is simply not enough societal need or demand.  Is Hale <br>
trying to say that everyone who wants to star-gaze for a living should <br>
have the opportunity to do so?!<br>
<p>
After spending several years through my early twenties studying things <br>
on my own, wandering the country and learning several trades, I <br>
realized I should go to school and begin a professional career.  Given <br>
my aptitudes and dispositions, I thought there was nothing I'd rather <br>
be than a hydrographer.  Well, a little market research soon told me <br>
that there wasn't that great a demand for hydrographers; so, I <br>
switched to 'computers' - actually systems science, as I was always <br>
more interested in software than hardware. Anyway, I don't regret not <br>
becoming a hydrographer...<br>
