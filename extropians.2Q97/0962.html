<i>&gt; Is there anything that a vegan is in danger of missing? Do I need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; suppliment my diet, or are there naturally occuring provdiders?</i><br>
<p>
B12 is probably the only thing you can't get from a vegan diet,<br>
but you don't need much--it's likely you'll get enough just from<br>
the things you don't check out carefully (the occasional baked<br>
good with egg or gelatin or milk).  Most vegans take supplements<br>
but probably don't need to.  Protein is not a problem, and the<br>
old Lappe nonsense about carefully mixing protein sources to get<br>
"balanced" amino acid levels has been debunked, so there's<br>
nothing inherently wrong with a vegan diet.<br>
<p>
But, since there is actually no valid evidence that a vegan diet <br>
is better than a more well-rounded low-fat diet, I think it would<br>
be negligent to recommend it to anyone except for religious<br>
reasons.  I am a lacto-veg myself, but I don't go out of my way<br>
to ask every restaurant if they use a little lard in their beans<br>
or gelatin in their desserts.  It just isn't worth the effort<br>
for unproven gains.<br>
