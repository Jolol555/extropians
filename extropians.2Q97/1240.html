<i>&gt;      Thanks for your feedback.  From an extropian p.o.v, I agree that </i><br>
<i>&gt;      robotics has beneficial ramifications to a broad spectrum of our </i><br>
<i>&gt;      society, provided our current work ethic evolves along with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;      technology.  Ask any blue collar worker whose livelihood has been </i><br>
<i>&gt;      usurped by technology, they'd likely have a different (albeit </i><br>
<i>&gt;      knee-jerk) view.  </i><br>
      <br>
Yes, I have had a few laughs over that one.  I just tell people, that is<br>
those who will be taking white collar jobs, that I intend to make people's<br>
lives better by kicking them out of work.  On a side note, when people say<br>
we cannot automate anymore they are saying that society's mental capacity<br>
is stretched to its fullest.  How pessimistic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      I'd need more convincing about your statement "The best way to help </i><br>
<i>&gt;      people is to help yourself."  Sounds kinda like the Republicans in</i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;      80s with their trickle-down economics.  It's also like the glass is </i><br>
<i>&gt;      half-empty, half-full concept.  It may be a very complex path from</i><br>
the <br>
<i>&gt;      results of your efforts to the benefit they perceive (and they may</i><br>
not <br>
<i>&gt;      be well-informed enough to even perceive it).  Therefore, the</i><br>
concept <br>
<i>&gt;      seems to require an installation of "faith" to power it.  OTOH, you </i><br>
<i>&gt;      can't help/love others until you help/love yourself.  I agree with </i><br>
<i>&gt;      that conceptually.  It's just in our culture, the "pure concept" </i><br>
<i>&gt;      becomes an entangled mess of complex exceptions and exclusions when </i><br>
<i>&gt;      filtered through the bureaucracy, the propriety and materialistic </i><br>
<i>&gt;      mindset.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Bottom line: you can't help another person who is drowning if you</i><br>
are <br>
<i>&gt;      in a vulnerable position of going under yourself.  So I do agree</i><br>
that <br>
<i>&gt;      those of us who are capable should get our ducks squarely lined up </i><br>
<i>&gt;      (financially and otherwise).  However, I don't think we need to</i><br>
spend <br>
<i>&gt;      extra time wringing out our wet clothes while the needy continue to </i><br>
<i>&gt;      thrash in water over their heads.  They don't KNOW how to swim.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Whether it's their fault or they deserve what they get is secondary </i><br>
<i>&gt;      when they are about to perish.</i><br>
<p>
I'll admit to a decent probability that "The best way to help others is to<br>
help yourself," may only work in a completely free market but I can come up<br>
with a good argument for it now.  Say I have the choice between wringing<br>
out my clothes and saving the drowning  people (at little risk to myself<br>
other than wet clothes).  There is a decent chance that once this person<br>
has recovered they will be grateful and may do something for me.  For<br>
instance, they may buy me dinner or give me some sort of reward or just owe<br>
me a favor (assuming I will see them again).  So long as the probability of<br>
reward  X  the amount of the reward is greater than the cost of wet clothes<br>
(p  X  a  &gt; c) I will be helping myself by helping another.  This can be<br>
extended to a real world situation by considering the chance that educating<br>
a large number of people will end up benefiting you (either directly or<br>
indirectly) more than any other use of your resources.  <br>
<p>
Of course, in a completely free market, prices will indicate where<br>
resources are most in demand.  <br>
      <br>
That faith jab was a low blow. ; )<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      Also, let me just reiterate that financial investment is not an</i><br>
issue <br>
<i>&gt;      I disdain.  I'd like to become more adept at understanding the</i><br>
current <br>
<i>&gt;      mechanism and I'm appreciating the contributions made along this </i><br>
<i>&gt;      thread.  I am concerned at how quickly we forget where we came from</i><br>
in <br>
<i>&gt;      our own financial climb.  Our "standard of living" gets higher, we </i><br>
<i>&gt;      want more "stuff" and there seems to be less connection to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;      community needs and our ability to assist.  </i><br>
<p>
Once again, assisting others can be seen as a form of investing.  Good<br>
feelings can be considered a return as well.  It's important not to condemn<br>
someone for enjoying a 42" television more than the good feelings generated<br>
by helping others.  Enjoyment is somewhat irrational anyone (of course,<br>
that does not mean its a bad thing, just it is a goal to be pursued by<br>
rational means).<br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;      Looking to the future with a more extropian outlook, I'd like to see</i><br>
a <br>
<i>&gt;      move beyond the current concept of market economy.  Nanotechnology,</i><br>
if <br>
<i>&gt;      its promise of providing everything from manufactured electronics to</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      assembled filet mignon, could facilitate a smooth transition from a </i><br>
<i>&gt;      hoarding, survivalist self-oriented mentality to a connected, </i><br>
<i>&gt;      supportive and benevolent one. I think utopia is possible and I</i><br>
refuse <br>
<i>&gt;      to believe that humanity isn't capable of transcending instinctual, </i><br>
<i>&gt;      animalstic tendencies to survive at all costs.  </i><br>
<p>
That's what extropy is all about.  I am trying to move beyond human<br>
instincts (beyond human actually) and, in the end, I intend to carry others<br>
with me.  By that time hoarding will be irrelevant.  The more material<br>
resources one has the more freedom they have (they have the option to give<br>
it away as well).  In a post human existence more material resources will<br>
mean investment in the self through faster hardware and expanded memory<br>
(granted this is an oversimplification but forgive me for being human, it's<br>
a condition I'm working on overcoming).      <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      If extropian thinking means pushing the envelope, I'd like to</i><br>
include <br>
<i>&gt;      the eventual elimination of the apathy we use as a protection</i><br>
against <br>
<i>&gt;      feeling for those who "have not" (those on the economic edge who </i><br>
<i>&gt;      unluckily fall off) or "can not" (mentally ill/emotionally abused). </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      The other group, the "will nots"--that group of non-contributors who</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      prefer non-participation--are a tougher group for which to drum up </i><br>
<i>&gt;      genuine compassion.  I don't know how to regard people who expect to</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      live in a structured community but not contribute to it.</i><br>
<p>
If nano-tech makes giving someone shelter as easy as dropping a few coins<br>
in a tin can than this will not be a concern.<br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;      As I become more aware of the tenets of libertarianism, I'm still</i><br>
not <br>
<i>&gt;      sure at how compassion for the disenfranchised sector fits into the </i><br>
<i>&gt;      schema.  From what I can perceive, impassive and continuous giving</i><br>
is <br>
<i>&gt;      considered a dysfunctional form of "enabling", only serving to </i><br>
<i>&gt;      perpetuate their lack of usefulness.  I don't want to have tax</i><br>
dollars <br>
<i>&gt;      going toward a feeble welfare system, one so over-burdened with </i><br>
<i>&gt;      bureaucracy that people blatantly take full advantage of it and suck</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      it dry.  But how can I stand in judgment of that type of person when</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      in some capacity, we all take advantage of a system, whether it's </i><br>
<i>&gt;      driving past the agreed upon speed limit, eluding building permit </i><br>
<i>&gt;      rules, excluding items on our tax returns, or using company e-mail</i><br>
to <br>
<i>&gt;      spout our personal agendas &lt;G&gt;.  The welfare hackers just seem more </i><br>
<i>&gt;      obvious and, perhaps despicable, because they are lower in the class</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;      system and provide no ongoing contribution to justify the</i><br>
peccadilloes <br>
<i>&gt;      of their higher class fellow citizens.</i><br>
<p>
Actually, I'm just evading unjust limits on my freedom.  I never agreed to<br>
those constraints and since there is a monopoly held by force I have no<br>
other options.  LGW did a good job of expressing the problems with the<br>
welfare system in general.<br>
      <br>
<i>&gt;      Perhaps a question to end with is how does extropian </i><br>
<i>&gt;      living/thinking/feeling empower beyond the self?  Is</i><br>
self-empowerment <br>
<i>&gt;      the tried-and-true solution to community/national/planetary </i><br>
<i>&gt;      enhancement or is it merely a notion of the noble-minded </i><br>
<i>&gt;      intellegencia?  </i><br>
<p>
I guess the question is this:  Is society as we know it today built on<br>
selfless giving?  I think the answer is an obvious no.  <br>
