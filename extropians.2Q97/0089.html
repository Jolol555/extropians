Something which might emerge before uploading becomes fully feasible<br>
would be some form of World Wide Neural Net. When we can directly<br>
interface wetware and hardware we should soon after be able to create<br>
implants to connect us to the Web via something like cellular phone<br>
service.  <br>
<p>
Is anyone aware of any sci-fi which explores and elaborates on this<br>
idea?<br>
<p>
One of the aspects of this which interests me most is its ramifications<br>
for the technomad and specifically for the technomad seeking an<br>
accreditated education. As universities begin to offer accreditated<br>
degrees via the Web, students are no longer limited in where they exist.<br>
The individual can participate from nearly any place in the world. With<br>
direct neural access this is taken a step further. Nearly every<br>
neurological stimulus could then be sent and retrieved, thus enabling a<br>
full spectrum of communication within the collective cybernetic<br>
consciousness.<br>
<p>
Bridging ethical boundaries for a moment. This technology might even<br>
enable an instructor to directly access a student's memory to ascertain<br>
just what exactly the student has retained. Of course this is only a<br>
small part of education, and only one of many ways in which direct<br>
neural interfacing could conceivably be used in education.  <br>
<p>
Explore and play! <br>
