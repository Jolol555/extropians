Aaah... somebody mentioned the book alt.culture and I remembered<br>
that they have a web site at www.altculture.com<br>
(It's actually cool, just try their "auto-pilot" feature for a TV-like<br>
experience :-)<br>

Here's what they have to say at<br>

Extropians<br>

California-based nonprofit mini-cult of fewer than 500 members built on<br>
the belief that future technologies will overcome problems that today<br>
seem insoluble. Immortality through technology is a central tenet of<br>
Extropianism: fervent hopes for the future include cryogenics, time<br>
travel, and uploading one's consciousness to a computer. The<br>
organization, whose guiding light is an Englishman called Max More (b.<br>
Max O'Connor), also embraces libertarian thinkers such as Ayn Rand;<br>
ideas like privatizing the air are expounded in the magazine Extropy,<br>
as are neologisms like "de-animation" (death), "disasturbation"<br>
(wishful disaster scenarios), and "smart-faced" (stoned). The<br>
Extropians' slender achievements were hymned in a lengthy 1994 _Wired_<br>
feature.<br>
