Parental genetic imprinting has been cropping up in recent journals- a<br>
mechanism whereby alleles are slightly different in effect when received<br>
from either M or F parent.  One study found mice get their brains from<br>
their mums and their poisonalities from their dads.<br>
<p>
The latest, in this week's Nature, I believe, found that Turner's syndrome<br>
(single X) girls are either empathic sweeties or naughty depending on<br>
whether they got their X from dad or mum.  Counter-intuitively, the<br>
Male-derived X is switched on for the former trait, and kickstarts the<br>
developmental cascade that encourages sociality and Niceness and Sugar &amp;<br>
Spice stuff.   The Female-derived X has the gene turned off (it seems), so<br>
boys are all prone to be horrid self-centred bastards.  <br>
<p>
It struck me that the road to utopia is therefore clear - switch on that<br>
gene in boy foetuses.  (I assume it's way too late to do anything once the<br>
developmental path is well-launched.)  It wouldn't turn boys gay, I presume<br>
- or (a different point entirely) into wimps, because women are obviously<br>
capable of protective ferocity, not to mention crabbiness.  But it would do<br>
the world a lot of good if human males were like females in this general<br>
respect.  &lt;pause to allow the alpha males to bellow in rage&gt;  Science<br>
fiction has verged on such a possibility in books such as Stanislaw Lem's<br>
RETURN FROM THE STARS, where men are calmed but not literally emasculated<br>
by `betrization', and in John Brunner's STAND ON ZANZIBAR, where a mutation<br>
makes everyone in a certain tribe more empathic.<br>
<p>
A further speculation: every now and then, the salient gene will be tweaked<br>
on by accident or mutation in a male.  What critter emerges?  A (potential)<br>
saint, perhaps?  Jesus and Buddha and St Francis?  Or, after all, Priscilla<br>
Queen of the Zodiac?<br>
<p>
Ditto girls with dad's gene tweaked off in error - the rare bad/andro girl?<br>
 Serial killettes?  Mrs Thatcher?  (Prob not the latter; she used her full<br>
complement of sociality skills to other than standard ends, I suspect.)<br>
But it means that the old sf scheme of lesbians making kids sans men by<br>
recombining haploid bits of their ova would lead to a world of women just<br>
as nasty and brutish as the men they replace (but shorter)...<br>
