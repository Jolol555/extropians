<i>&gt;From what I remember of my astronomy course, it is a general principle that</i><br>
an object which varies over a time scale t can't be much larger than t*c<br>
in size.  Or, putting it the other way, an object which is t*c in size can't<br>
be seen to vary strongly with time scales much less than t.<br>
<p>
The reason is that, generally, the radiation will come to us from all over<br>
the object, or at least all over the side of the object facing us.  The<br>
distances to the different parts of the object, assuming it is t*c in size,<br>
will therefore vary by around t*c/2 between the closest and farthest parts<br>
of the object that we see.  We are really dealing with orders of magnitude<br>
here so that is effectively about the same as t*c.<br>
<p>
Now, if the object suddenly and uniformly changes its brightness,<br>
we will still see the brightness to change over a period of about t.<br>
First the closest part of the object will brighten, then the farther<br>
parts, and so on.  There will be a difference in time of about t from<br>
when we see the object start to brighten until the brightness change is<br>
complete.<br>
<p>
You can imagine geometries where this might not happen; for example, if<br>
the object were plane shaped, and we were face on to it, and the whole<br>
thing changed at once, then it could change suddenly in brightness even<br>
though the plane was larger than t*c.  However this requires unusual<br>
geometry, and in that case there should be a range of objects with<br>
varying time scales but otherwise similar behavior (where the geometry<br>
happens to be more typical), and I don't think that is the case with GRBs.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure how Carl Feynmann got those incredible numbers about the<br>
energy density within the GRB.  Presumably you look at its (huge) distance<br>
from us, look at the energy we saw, assume that it was radiating that<br>
much energy in all directions, and get a whole lot of energy.  Then the<br>
whole event takes a few seconds, so it has to have all originated in a<br>
small volume, and things get pretty hard to explain.<br>
<p>
One thing I was thinking was that the radiation could perhaps be going<br>
out in a tight beam.  GRB's would actually be much more common than we<br>
see, but most of them miss us.  However you would still have extremely<br>
high energy densities unless the beam is super tight.  Also the fact<br>
that something was visible for hours or days afterwards doesn't sound<br>
right for a tight-beam phenomenon.<br>
