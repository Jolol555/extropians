I sent this message to Alan Hale:<br>

Dear Alan:<br>
<p>
Although I meet your criteria for someone who you wanted to hear from, I’m<br>
not sure that everything I’m going to say will conform to your expectations.<br>
<p>
I definitely sympathize with much of what you are doing, particularly your<br>
efforts to raise awareness of the harsh realities of the science job market.<br>
Had the real situation been more widely known when I was younger, the process<br>
I followed in seeking a career would have probably been much more efficient,<br>
and I almost certainly would have ended my years studying physics after<br>
getting my M.S.<br>
<p>
As it was, I had been encouraged for all of my life to follow my love for<br>
science to a career in it, and it was always implied that there were plenty<br>
of jobs waiting for me if I did. So, I went on towards a Ph.D., a decision I<br>
now feel wasted quite a few years of my life. The closer I got to a Ph.D.,<br>
the more evidence I saw that the what I had been told concerning the<br>
plenitude of science jobs was a myth, and that the reality was that there<br>
were not nearly enough jobs to go around. Finally, in 1994, I decided to jump<br>
ship, and gradually managed to parlay my computer skills into what has become<br>
a fairly satisfying career in information technology.<br>
<p>
I personally know people who haven’t been as lucky, and again, I sympathize.<br>
However, I’m not sure precisely what sort of "drastic changes in the way<br>
society approaches science" you could be proposing, or what exactly you<br>
expect to result from meetings with government leaders.<br>
<p>
The problem, in a nutshell, is that the supply of scientists (especially<br>
physicists, astronomers, and chemists; certain fields have faired better) has<br>
been growing much faster than the economy and the population. It is a matter<br>
of supply-and-demand, exasperated by the sudden end of the Cold War and the<br>
subsequent reduction in defense expenditures. It’s very sad, but I find it<br>
hard to imagine our cash-strapped government doing much about it, or society<br>
reacting positively to any assertion that people who want to be scientists<br>
should be protected from the realities of life.<br>
<p>
What could you say to a person who responded "I wanted to be a (fill in the<br>
blank; actor, professional football player…) but eventually I realized that<br>
it wasn’t likely to happen, and I moved on. That’s life."<br>
<p>
Yes, I personally value scientific research more highly than theater or pro<br>
football, but I also think that it is pointless to expect the government to<br>
repeal the laws of the marketplace and somehow effectively employ all of our<br>
would-be scientists. Rather, I think that the answer lies in people using<br>
their scientific talents to help grow our economy and make our society more<br>
efficient, so that ultimately we will live in a society that can afford to<br>
fund more scientific research. After all, scientists have faired much worse<br>
in the societies of the former Communist world, where the laws of the<br>
marketplace were more blatantly ignored.<br>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
<p>
Michael E. Smith<br>
