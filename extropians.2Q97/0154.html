<i>&gt; I was complaining about our society in general, not about this forum</i><br>
<i>&gt; in particular.  And to our general society, "philosophy itself" seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; much less interesting and fruitful than lowering the apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt; subsantial costs due to misunderstandings and uncertainties regarding</i><br>
<i>&gt; desired and expected sex roles.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Robin D. Hanson</i><br>
 <br>
Philosophy may well seem [to you, and perhaps to many] less fruitful to<br>
society.  Good thing I don't give a damn about society then.  I care<br>
only about how I might act and deal with other individuals to achieve<br>
my individual ends, and how I can eliminate things like "society" that <br>
might get in my way.<br>
<p>
But let's for the moment assume that knowledge of what the expected<br>
gender roles in society will be is worth my effort to speculate on<br>
and criticize.  Let us then identify what factors might lead to change.<br>
<p>
- The initial cause of gender role divergence, i.e., the tremendous<br>
  differential in investment of calories, risk, and time in the<br>
  production of children between genders, is lessening.  Calories are<br>
  cheaper, risks are lower, time is more productive, and children<br>
  themselves are produced less.  So it is likely that assumptions of<br>
  egalitarianism will be more useful as time goes on, though they<br>
  will never achieve parity until men actually carry children or<br>
  women no longer do.  Public institutions should reflect more equal<br>
  treatment under law except where absolutely tied to the basics of<br>
  reproduction, and society will likely favor such law changes.  All<br>
  "roles" not related directly to investment in children should be<br>
  eliminated in favor of assumed equality.<br>
<p>
- Since reproduction-based institutions like marriage will have an<br>
  increasingly smaller role in society, we might expect laws that<br>
  temper or eliminate them will become more politically advisable.<br>
  Gay marriage, adoption, polyamoury, and other alternative family<br>
  arrangements will probably become more accepted, and laws giving<br>
  special privilege to them less accepted.<br>
<p>
- Since the investment of genetic parenthood is decreasing, laws<br>
  that favor genetic parents rights over acting parents should be<br>
  reduced or eliminated.  Contract law in reproduction in general<br>
  should be more strongly enforce and less regulated.  These laws<br>
  will be more difficult to change for psycological reasons.<br>
<p>
- Since cultural evolution is much faster than genetic evolution, it<br>
  is likely that our psychological predispositions will not change<br>
  to match the more egalitarian culture.  It might be good, then, to<br>
  realize those predispositions now and accept them so their future<br>
  divergence from egalitarian ethics won't catch us by surprize.  In<br>
  particular, it is probably a good idea to continue gender-specific<br>
  fashions and marketing without apology, and to eliminate private<br>
  anti-discrimination laws that prohibit free association based on<br>
  gender (in private schools and businesses, for example).  It is<br>
  likely that such moves may encounter resistance from dogmatic<br>
  egalitarianists, so some such changes might be difficult.  I don't<br>
  have a solution to this problem in mind.<br>
<p>
Those are my initial guesses.  I'm sure others will have more.<br>
