<i>&gt; Artificial Emotion Program:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   IF x occurs THEN run fear subroutine</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   fear subroutine:</i><br>
<i>&gt;       PLAY scream.wav audio file</i><br>
<i>&gt;       DISPLAY ominous.jpg image file </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Is that an emotion!?! When exactly did the computer feel an emotion? The</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer is processing its data and x occurs. But it did not feel x, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; merely recognizes x in a very detached manner. The computer then runs</i><br>
<i>&gt; the fear subroutine. The computer "appears" to be displaying an emotion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but it never felt one. And it does not feel itself playing the sound</i><br>
<i>&gt; file or displaying the image. It merely does it without feeling. Perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; you would like to rewrite my hypothetical program above to show me how</i><br>
<i>&gt; theoretically you believe a computer could experience emotions without</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardware for experiencing sensations. Anyone? Please, this would be most</i><br>
<i>&gt; enlightening. You might even recieve the Nobel Prize.</i><br>
<p>
The problem here is that human emotion and cognition are largely<br>
mysterious, at least to the individual.  Any computer program is going to<br>
be obviously deterministic.  Since it would be a relatively<br>
straightforward, if tedious, task to tell what math the emotions are based<br>
on one could assume that the computer is simply following the logical<br>
course of action as set forth by its programming. Of course, saying that<br>
emotion cannot be logical would also rule out human beings assuming there<br>
were other beings capable of seeing all of the deterministic processes that<br>
lead to emotion.  You could tell this being that you are unaware of these<br>
processes.  A computer could tell you the same thing.  In the case of both<br>
the computer and the human, we have a finite number of calculations taking<br>
place in a finite space.  Therefore, to a more complex observer, everything<br>
appears logically deterministic.<br>
<p>
To write a program for cognition and emotion one needs to know the process<br>
behind thought selection.  I do not and I doubt anyone else does. <br>
Therefore, we run up against a wall of not knowing enough about ourselves<br>
to create mind children, at least through design.  Alife is an entirely<br>
different story.<br>
