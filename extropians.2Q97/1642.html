There are two different human species in this conversation. One of<br>
them is an ape gene pool. The other one is six billion people,<br>
acculturated in a variety of ways, who are participating in a<br>
culture and an economy that has global ramifications, many of which<br>
support and enrich my life.<br>
<p>
I don't really care much about the first human species in the<br>
abstract. I care rather intensely about the second one. Of course,<br>
they are one and the same, since this is a strictly conceptual<br>
dichotomy, not a material dichotomy. But bear with me.<br>
<p>
The fact that senescence might just possibly be in the best interests<br>
of the first human species impresses me not much. The fact that<br>
senescence kills people off mere decades after they begin to get<br>
the knack of enjoyably participating in the second human species<br>
bugs me.  To put it mildly.<br>
<p>
The subject line for this thread is something of a joke. Last I<br>
checked, there was no pilot for the cosmos, no architect who designed<br>
us. No one to allow or disallow anything, save for us wildlife. If<br>
I anthropomorphized genes, it was to emphasize that no one *else*<br>
has been in charge of bringing about our current situation, in<br>
which we find our bodies riddled with junk genes that unleash<br>
cancers after several decades, genes which were the result of random<br>
cosmic ray strikes and then, according to the Medawar theory of<br>
senescence (which I favor) simply never got selected out of the<br>
gene pool because they had no effect on reproductive success. So<br>
we age and die.<br>
<p>
At least until we do something to change that.<br>
<p>
Until we have ruled out the possibility of molecular nanotechnology<br>
(and we haven't even gotten close to ruling out that possibility<br>
yet), it seems to me developing this technology would offer the<br>
shortest path to being able to do the extremely gnarly gene therapy<br>
we're going to need to remove or suppress the junk in our genomes<br>
that kills us. This year it looks like software development is one<br>
route toward molecular nanotechnology that might help, so I'm<br>
working on acquiring skills in that area, and I'm also trying to<br>
bone up on some of the chemistry I've already studied and some of<br>
the engineering I've never studied before.<br>
<p>
If molecular nanotech doesn't pan out, perhaps I'll return to my<br>
original undergrad field, biochemistry, and see what I can do with<br>
that.<br>
<p>
(It could be that I am distracted from molecular biology proper<br>
toward molecular nanotechnology because the latter is also a possible<br>
shortcut toward the development of the resources of outer space,<br>
which is another of my interests. Chess players and go players<br>
alike find forking attacks seductive.)<br>
