The two aren't mutually exclusive.<br>
<p>
On this particular subject (nieces) you are obviously unfeeling (I"m not<br>
being pejorative, just literal).  Says nothing about whether you're unfeeling<br>
about anything else.<br>
<p>
Fondness for family is to a large extent programmed for genetic replication.<br>
 Nothing senseless about ignoring it, or not having it.<br>
<p>
(Of course, it might have been sensible to withold your opinions from<br>
traditionalist family members :-)<br>
<p>
Aren't you happy at least for the effect on your brother and parents?<br>
