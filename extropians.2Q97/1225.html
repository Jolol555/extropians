	I think about how I could best help others.  The way I will help others is<br>
through my work (I'm looking into robotics).  Of course, helping others is<br>
secondary.  I am most interested in the benefits to myself through the<br>
paycheck, the enjoyment of the work, and the advancement of my personal<br>
posthumanity, which happens to coincide with everybody else's.<br>
	I could help people by forcing others to give money but that has too many<br>
problems.  First there is the cost of force, then there is the loss of<br>
initiative (from the forced and the beneficiary).  In all, it does not<br>
cause the evolution of humanity.<br>
	The best way to help people is to help yourself.  If your goals are high<br>
enough, their will be spillover of benefits to the rest of the population. <br>
For instance, if I invest in life extension I can receive the benefits of<br>
wealth and the benefits of increased life span.  Others benefit from the<br>
increased life span as well (provided they want it enough to pay for it).<br>
	I could be a humanitarian and work in a third world country helping people<br>
but, besides the fact that I do not want to, I do not think it is the best<br>
way to help people.     <br>
	As for ego, in posthumanity the self will be those who are in constant<br>
communication.  If I know all your thoughts and you know all my thoughts<br>
then we are the same being.  Individuality will be somewhat different then<br>
it is now.<br>
