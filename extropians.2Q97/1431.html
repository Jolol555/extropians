Hal Finney:<br>
<i>&gt;This also raises the question, how did the Borg acquire the technology they</i><br>
<i>&gt;have?  </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Generally speaking, in a competition, the higher technology will</i><br>
<i>&gt;win, especially when you are talking about phasers and shields and warp</i><br>
<i>&gt;drives.  So the Borg should be unable to defeat an enemy with higher</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology than themselves.  The only reason they are a threat to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Federation is because they have better technology.</i><br>
<p>
I think that you should clarify your above statement to include <br>
matters of tactics and strategy.  Our own human war experiences <br>
contain many examples of low-tech strategies disabling <br>
higher-technology forces, including the use of civil disobedience in <br>
South America, the disabling of Nazi installations by the Resistance, <br>
and the American experience in Vietnam.  Technology in and of itself <br>
produces no effect in isolation from effective strategies tailored to <br>
the specific arena.  But that is if you choose to engage in the first <br>
place--the highest state of war involves the neutralizion of an <br>
enemy in advance of meeting them in combat.<br>
