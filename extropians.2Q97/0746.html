<i>&gt; &gt;Actually I find the political claim--the idea that some unnamed agency</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;of government might be capable of supressing a spectacularly valuable</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;invention, that it would be in their interest to do so, and that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;effect on the economy would be anything but positive--even more ludicrous</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than the pseudo-scientific claims, and strong evidence that the author</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is not merely a harmless crackpot but trying to perpetrate a deliberate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fraud upon his readers for some purpose I can only speculate.  And while</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I might have some sympathy for innocent dupes, I have none for criminals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, what about FDA shenanigans?  As a libertarian, surely you think</i><br>
<i>&gt; there's something a bit fishy going on there?  It's not too much to</i><br>
<i>&gt; extend one's paranoia a bit more, is it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Guru George</i><br>
<p>
Of course--criminals are criminals whether in or out of government.<br>
How does that relate to our discussion?  I don't see any connection.<br>
If by 'paranoia' you mean 'distrust of government', then that's fine<br>
with me.  I never expressed any trust in them, I merely find it<br>
absurd to grant them the competence and power to do what it was<br>
suggested they are doing.  I wholly grant that they are capable of<br>
sinister motives--in fact I assume it.<br>
<p>
But I don't let my speculation about people's motives cloud my<br>
judgment of facts.  I don't take sides, I hold principles.<br>
