<i>&gt; &gt;Or course it's in question, or I wouldn't have asked.  I find not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;merely insufficient evidence, but /no/ evidence, and not even the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;attempt at evidence that they do a damned thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Lee: I'm surprised. I agree that there isn't a whole lot of really good</i><br>
<i>&gt; experimental evidence for smart drugs working on young, healthy people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, there is plenty of good evidence that they work on people with</i><br>
<i>&gt; cognitive deficits, and there appears to be *some* good experimental</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence for affects on young healthy people for at some of the substances.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, I suppose I am exaggerating.  I suppose I'm just disappointed<br>
by what I've been able to find for the layman.  I'm sure there are<br>
some good therapeutic studies that might generalize well, and there<br>
might be (as Tony suggested) some value in looking at data from the<br>
control groups of those studies as well.<br>
<p>
My ire should be directed at the mass marketers of these things who<br>
look only for vaguely-applicable studies that justify their sales<br>
rather than looking for honest facts about their everyday benefits<br>
to ordinary people.<br>
<p>
I'm sure the misguided ethical barriers to cosmetic pharmacology<br>
cause grant-seeking researchers to look elsewhere, but real capitalist<br>
researchers should be looking for the cosmetic uses to /really/<br>
boost sales among skeptics like me.  The gullible will buy anyway,<br>
so they have real incentive to do those tests to prove the value of<br>
the products to joe consumer while the "ethical" doctors can keep<br>
sucking the public teat for their studies.<br>
