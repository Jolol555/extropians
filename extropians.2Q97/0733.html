<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;I am no geologist.  I am no economist.  To say we are running out of any</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;mineral (except oil) just basically seems silly.  The earth's crust should</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;be strewn with every mineral known to man (and then some....wood and air is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;a far more known limiter).</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Julian Simon is an economist and I think one of his main points is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; throughout history scarcity itself has helped to preserve the Earth's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; natural resources. As long as a resource is considered useful, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; considered valuable (and worthy) and it will have a price. The more scarce a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; resource becomes, the higher the price will go.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; As the price goes up, the number of buyers who think it is still worth the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; price will go down. This has a similar effect as conservation, i.e., fewer</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; users of a resource.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Simon uses fossil fuel as an example. He says we will NEVER run out of oil.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Technically, he's probably right. As oil becomes scarce, the price rises. By</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the time the price becomes cost-prohibitive, other useful alternatives or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; substitutes will be invented or discovered. By the time we have very little</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; oil left, it will be so expensive that no one will want to buy it, so we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; will never really run out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is also the effect of increased prices on recovery cost</i><br>
<i>&gt;effectiveness. WHenever you hear of someone saying there is only 30</i><br>
<i>&gt;years worth of oil left, they mean that there is that much in reserves</i><br>
<i>&gt;available that are cost effective enough to recover at today's market</i><br>
<i>&gt;prices. Obviously there is plenty of oil that is too expensive to</i><br>
<i>&gt;recover right now, but as demand rises and prices inflate, those other</i><br>
<i>&gt;reserves become cost effective. This is one of the little lies that</i><br>
<i>&gt;environmentalists and conservationists tell to get support, because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;imply to the less intelligent people that there is ONLY 30 years worth</i><br>
<i>&gt;of oil at ANY  price left. There is literally  a HUGE supply of oil in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ground, enough that it will be a few thousand years before we use it</i><br>
<i>&gt;all up at a minimum.</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- </i><br>
An abstraction just occurred to me related to the above:- that the<br>
supply is virtually infinite because matter could, at the extremest limit,<br>
be transformed (recycled?) into oil, if we really wanted it, and had the<br>
technology.<br>
