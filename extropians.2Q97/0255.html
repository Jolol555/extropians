Lee: I'm surprised. I agree that there isn't a whole lot of really good<br>
experimental evidence for smart drugs working on young, healthy people.<br>
However, there is plenty of good evidence that they work on people with<br>
cognitive deficits, and there appears to be *some* good experimental<br>
evidence for affects on young healthy people for at some of the substances.<br>
By good experimental evidence, I mean double-blind, controlled, cross-over<br>
experiments. One of the newest discoveries--ampakines--having been found to<br>
improve memory in older people, are being tested on young folks by<br>
researchers like Gary Lynch at UC Irvine. <br>
<p>
Do you discount *all* the studies cited in books like Smart Drugs and<br>
Nutrients by Dean and Morgenthaler. Certainly, the evidence is often in<br>
terms of theoretical arguments that these substances ought to work and come<br>
along with pretty useless personal stories. However, there *are* some<br>
studies that apparently used good methodology. I'm wondering whether you<br>
just haven't come across these, or whether you have reasons to dispute all<br>
such cases.<br>
