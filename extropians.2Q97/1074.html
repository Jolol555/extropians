<p>
As I've pointed out, there is no scientific evidence for this assertion, and<br>
the assertors display a distressing lack of basic biology knowledge.  If this<br>
were actually true, since Westerners already get more energy than they need<br>
from their food (that's why so many are fat), proper food combiners would<br>
tend to be even fatter.  "Not enough energy from food" is simply not a<br>
problem even for the strictest vegan.<br>
<p>
The only grain of truth here is that digestion, particularly of fiber and<br>
starch, does take a lot of water, and eating this way means you'll have<br>
gotten a lot of water before your starches.  But there's no need to get the<br>
water for digesting the beans by eating fruit 2 hours in advance - drinking a<br>
glass with the meal wil work just as well.<br>
