Subject: NEAP Status 05/03/97<br>
<p>
Greetings,<br>
<p>
The Near Earth Asteroid Prospector venture is coming along nicely.<br>
<p>
I have created this distribution list of over one hundred people who<br>
have expressed an interest in being kept informed about progress, or<br>
people who I think are interested.<br>
<p>
I intend to mail to this list only occasionally, so being on this list<br>
will not be a burden to you. If you wish to be removed, please just<br>
email me, and I will be happy to comply. If you receive two copies, it<br>
is because you are also on the space-investor list -- let me know and<br>
I will remove the duplicate.<br>
<p>
NEAP summary: <br>
<p>
NEAP will be the first private spacecraft to leave earth orbit, the<br>
first private spacecraft to visit another planetary body, and the<br>
first private spacecraft to land on another planetary body. NEAP will<br>
carry sufficient instrumentation to size and categorize the asteroid,<br>
thereby allowing us to calculate a "street value" for it. After<br>
landing, we will "stake" any mining and patent claims we believe to be<br>
possible, and then will simply declare ownership of the trillion<br>
dollar asset. This will help draw attention to the need to establish<br>
private property rights in space. Nine sources of income from NEAP<br>
have been identified, two of which could each pay for the entire<br>
venture. The entire venture will be privately financed, with no<br>
government grant money of any kind (necessary to ensure a pure private<br>
claim of the asteroid and its resources).<br>
<p>
STATUS report:<br>
<p>
At this time, there are three university groups working on various<br>
aspects of NEAP design. The universities involved are UCSD, NM State,<br>
and U TX at Austin. Many of the approximately thirty students are<br>
mentored with senior scientists and engineers, and have been working<br>
on their assignments since early this year. The effort is headed by<br>
Dr. Jim Arnold, founder of the UCSD campus, and Director of the eight<br>
campus California Space Institute, and a NEAP advisor.<br>
<p>
I will be at UCSD / CalSpace all day on May 4 and 5 to receive study<br>
results on the following areas: mission design options, spacecraft<br>
design options, communications options and trajectory calculations for<br>
all potential near earth object targets. After the two day meeting,<br>
the three groups will continue to refine their analyses, in accordance<br>
with my technical feedback.<br>
<p>
I have spoken with Lockheed-Martin and MacDonnell Douglas about<br>
launch plans. One promising possibility is LM, which may be able to<br>
offer us a primary payload slot, with a low earth satellite as a<br>
secondary payload, thereby cutting our launch cost in half. LM is also<br>
interested in a creative proposal from me on how to finance the launch<br>
-- talks are ongoing. We have discussed joint venture types of deals<br>
with two startup launch vendors, and have as an advisor, the former<br>
head of the Russian space program, which resulted in a very<br>
attractively priced offer. Planned launch date is 2000 or 2001.<br>
<p>
Overall venture cost estimates have declined from over $80 million to<br>
less than $40 million. It is expected that the cost will continue to<br>
decline, but less rapidly.<br>
<p>
I will be in Princeton at the Space Studies Institute conference May 8<br>
through 11. The conference is chaired by one of our advisors, Dr. John<br>
Lewis. I spent a half day with John at his home about a week ago, just<br>
before I attended Henry Vanderbilt's excellent Space Access conference<br>
in Scottsdale. John will introduce me to the SSI conference attendees,<br>
and I will spend most of the conference identifying good people.<br>
<p>
I will then go on to Washington, DC where I have some very "high<br>
level" meetings concerning NEAP. After two days of meetings, I will<br>
return to my home in Colorado to incorporate the CalSpace study<br>
results into the NEAP business plan. I will spend two days with my<br>
corporate finance attorney on May 19 and 20, in preparation of formal<br>
capital formation, which I intend to start during June.<br>
<p>
I will give two talks at the International Space Development<br>
Conference (NSS/ISDC) in Orlando, May 22 to 26. The topics will be on<br>
the economics of space resource development and on space exploration.<br>
The talks will be Saturday and Sunday, May 24 and 25.<br>
<p>
On June 9 I will address the annual Astronautics States Association in<br>
Washington, DC and will use that opportunity to introduce NEAP to<br>
them. The ASA could be helpful in getting me in touch with local and<br>
regional space business roundtables, political contributors (possible<br>
sources of capital), and other potentially valuable contacts.<br>
<p>
On June 10, I will address the 190th annual meeting of the American<br>
Astronomical Society in Winston-Salem. I will use that opportunity to<br>
introduce the "Benson Prize for the Amateur Discovery of Near Earth<br>
Asteroids." This is a cash prize of $500 for each of the next ten<br>
amateur discoveries. Sky &amp; Telescope magazine will assist in spreading<br>
the word about the Benson Prize through a magazine article, and a<br>
Benson Prize page at their web site. It is intended that this Prize<br>
will increase the name recognition of Space Development LLC, myself<br>
and NEAP. In addition, it should stimulate the discovery of more<br>
potential NEAP targets.<br>
<p>
The SpaceDev advisory board has grown to include a "Who's Who" list of<br>
eighteen scientists and engineers.<br>
<p>
NEEDED:<br>
<p>
I believe that most aspects of NEAP are coming along very well. Two<br>
ares where I can use some help:<br>
<p>
1) contacts in mining, big construction, natural resources and energy<br>
companies -- these will be very important for a variety of reasons<br>
including funding, joint venture possibilities, political support for<br>
private property rights in space, etc.<br>
<p>
2) Money. I will be investing a significant amount of my own money in<br>
this venture, and in June will begin formal fund raising through the<br>
sale of equity in the company. While I have some good leads, I can<br>
never have too many. You may be surprised about the kinds of contacts<br>
you may have, even indirect contacts to wealthy people through<br>
friends, relatives and associates.<br>
<p>
I will appreciate and remember any help.<br>
<p>
NEXT report:<br>
<p>
I intend to distribute another progress report around mid-June.<br>
<p>
Many people have said that NEAP will excite the public with its bold<br>
mission to another planetary body, making its claims, and showing the<br>
general public that they can be involved in space activities, NOW.<br>
<p>
I will find all possible ways to leverage NEAP into a position<br>
to help create cheap access to space, to help other entrepreneurial<br>
companies, and in general to rekindle the public interest and hope in<br>
going to space in their lifetimes.<br>
<p>
I am open to any suggestions you may have, on any aspect of this<br>
venture.<br>
