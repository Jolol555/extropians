Yes, the better distinction is between small spaces, which include<br>
both basic values and general epistemic principles, and large spaces,<br>
such as lots of little new facts.  For evolution in small spaces, the<br>
information sharing function of sex is less important.  So I should<br>
restate my claim as that evolutionary pressure on small spaces, such<br>
as investment time-discount factors, should prefer asexual<br>
reproduction.<br>
<p>
I do think there is also an asymmetry between facts and values in that<br>
it is plausible to think of context-specific values as generated<br>
locally from facts and general values, while this is less plausible if<br>
we switch fact and value.  We really need lots of small fact info from<br>
other organisms, but its not clear we need to share context-specific<br>
values.<br>

<i>&gt;argues against the idea that current human values are in equilibrium.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, we are likely way out of equilibrium.  That is the motivation for<br>
trying to analyze what a future equilibrium would be.<br>
