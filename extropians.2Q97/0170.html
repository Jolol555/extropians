<p>
I am curious why, given your obvious excellent understanding of the<br>
situation.  I was exposed to nanotechnology *very* early, having known<br>
Eric Drexler since the min 70s.  It took a considerable time, but I<br>
eventually came to the conclusion that it made no sense to be one of the<br>
very last people to be lost, so I signed up.  Eventually I volunteered to<br>
help, and have been involved with freezing about 20 of Alcor's patients. <br>
(In recent years doing surgery to put the patients on cardiac bypass for<br>
cryoprotective perfusion.)<br>
<p>
I don't recomend that level of involvement for everyone :-) but cryonics<br>
is relatively inexpensive for the chance it offers.  Keith Henson<br>
