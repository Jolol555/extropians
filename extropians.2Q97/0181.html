Seems about right to me, but this depends mostly on motivation. Many<br>
people set out to change habits but don't have the motivation to do so<br>
properly or are so stuck in their social role that the people they<br>
interact with won't let them. It's just a matter of repeating the new<br>
behaviour until the new pathways through the brain's neural network take<br>
over and the old ones rot away through disuse. <br>

<i>&gt; 	Do you know of a modern, scientific, rational form of mysticism?</i><br>
<p>
Crowley's Thelema is the closest that I know of, though the Chaos<br>
Magickians might qualify. Of course Crowley never did get the hang of<br>
ego-loss himself, much to his chagrin. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; 	Do you know of any mystical scientists, living or dead?</i><br>
<p>
Didn't Crowley study Chemistry at Cambridge? I think someone already<br>
mentioned Newton, and various 20th century scientists have had some kind<br>
of mystic beliefs. Do Leary and Lilly count?<br>
