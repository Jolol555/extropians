        Psychologically, any idea of a divine, commandeering force is a sure<br>
sign of a weakened grip on reality.  It can be compared to a child's<br>
imaginary friend: the child believes that it is there, though the parent<br>
knows that it is not.  However, though children usually grow out of their<br>
imaginary friend, they don't often grow out of the need for an impetus or<br>
divine force.  One who depends on a god is one who fears responsibility;<br>
this can be proven with the concept of "praying".  Praying *does* have<br>
healing qualities.  This is not because the one who is praying is being<br>
'relieved by God' but because the one who is praying has such a strong<br>
belief that there are other shoulders (God or Jesus') to heap a burden on.<br>
In Einstein's case, he acknowledged the fact that all theorems which he<br>
'discovered' had been created by something else.  He saw whatever this force<br>
was as being 'God'.  He also understood that the Judeo-Christian God was so<br>
convoluted that there was no credibility.  In other words, Einstein ignored<br>
convention and followed what he thought were rational beliefs.<br>
