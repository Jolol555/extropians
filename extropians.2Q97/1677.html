The egg and sperm cells ('germ line') avoid accumulated junk by killing<br>
mutants.  The number of DNA changes per human reproduction is on the order<br>
of five, i.e. an error rate per base of 10^-9.  Most of the changes either<br>
don't make any difference, or are so bad that the embryo is spontaneously<br>
aborted.  The remainder are fodder for natural selection.<br>
<p>
I don't think the mutation rate is different for germ line than for other<br>
('somatic') cells.  Remember that a single wrong mutation in a somatic cell<br>
can cause cancer, and there are trillions of somatic cells, some of which<br>
reproduce every few weeks.<br>
