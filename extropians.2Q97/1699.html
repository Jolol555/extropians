I agree, sort of. If you just changed the hardware platform, such as <br>
replacing biological neurons with nanotechnology ones, it would not give you<br>
new abilities, except for much greater speed and memory. You could recite<br>
from memory any page from a book on advanced Physics, but you might not<br>
understand what it meant.<br>
<p>
The great thing about a well designed computer platform is that once somebody<br>
writes a program that gives a machine a new ability it's very easy to give<br>
that ability to all the other machines on the platform. The trouble with the<br>
Human brain is that it is not well designed, it is not designed at all, it's<br>
the product of millions of years of random mutation and natural selection<br>
producing just what you would expect, hideous spaghetti code. Well designed <br>
programs are easy to modify, with a sloppy program it's hard to even figure<br>
out how the damn thing works much less modify it, that's why it takes years <br>
to learn to play the piano. A master pianist can't just transmit his skill to <br>
others in a few seconds, so we must continually reinvent the wheel.<br>
<p>
I'll bet one of the first things an upload would try to do is untangle this<br>
messy code of his into a simpler more logical structure and then recompile<br>
it. This would be a gargantuan task that could take us thousands of years, <br>
even an upload might be at it for days before he was successful.<br>

<i>        &gt;it seems unlikely to me (stick neck out) that an ability arises out</i><br>

<p>
<p>
In theory all skills must be represented by data. If we have skills then our<br>
neurons must act that way, and they act that way if they have the correct<br>
structure, and they have the correct structure if the atoms in them are in<br>
the right place, and data will tell you if they are in the right place.<br>
Of course, figuring out what placement of atoms will let you play the piano<br>
is very far from trivial.<br>

<i>        &gt;One good news/bad news aspect of uploading is that it should be </i><br>

Yes.<br>
                   <br>
<i>        &gt;This is too bad, because actually in most ways the quality of life </i><br>
<i>        &gt;will be worse for the super-fast brain.  From the brain's point of </i><br>
<i>        &gt;view, it is as though the rest of the world is slowed down by a huge </i><br>
<i>        &gt;factor. Everything will be slow - computers, communication, </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If technology had advanced enough so we could upload a human mind then we<br>
would certainly have computers and communication links enormously faster than<br>
anything we have now, fast enough to keep up with any upload.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;any manipulation of the physical world. If you need to do experiments</i><br>
<i>        &gt;to learn more about nature, they will take (subjective) centuries to </i><br>
<i>        &gt;complete.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
The environment operates at all levels from Pico seconds to billions of years, <br>
all equally valid, the time frame of a biological human brain does not occupy <br>
a preferred position in the universe. For example, the arm on a Nanotechnology<br>
based Assembler would be 50 million times shorter than a human arm, and that<br>
means it could move back and forth 50 million times faster than a human arm.<br>
Also, just one pound of carbon has enough atoms to make a billion billion<br>
such Nano Robots. I think even the fastest upload would find plenty to do.<br>
                   <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;If you expect to live in a nifty VR, think again: computers will be </i><br>
<i>        &gt;a million times slower (subjectively) which will limit the quality </i><br>
<i>        &gt;of the simulations they can provide.  You may have to live in a </i><br>
<i>        &gt;cartoon world.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Concerning Virtual Reality, I don't see how speed could even be an issue for<br>
an upload. Even if the computer that was emulating you and the virtual world <br>
was very slow, from your point of view it would seem infinitely fast. If the <br>
machine had performance problems all you'd have to do is have the part of the <br>
program that was simulating you slowed down or even stopped, while leaving <br>
the part of the program that simulated the rest of the universe running at <br>
normal speed. Regardless of how many calculations it would take to convince <br>
you that the simulation was real it could all be done instantly, from your <br>
point of view. Once the machine was caught up, your part of the program could <br>
be carefully restarted till the next speed bottleneck.<br>
