Here's another interesting tidbit on the brain size business -<br>
<p>
Occaisionally people go in for brain scans and there's nothing there.  This<br>
caused great consternation on the part of the doctors until they realized<br>
that these people do have brains, it's just that they have them in the<br>
brainstem area.  I believe the problem is related to hydoencephelopathy (sp?)<br>
in that excessive fluid pressure pushes the brain into the spinal column<br>
during fetal development.  This condition is called microencephelopathy<br>
(sp?).  It's very rare.<br>
<p>
Anyway, although these people have brains, they are much smaller than normal.<br>
 I believe they go down to as small as 10% of normal size.  Strangely, they<br>
don't seem to have many mental functioning problem.  Generally there's no<br>
indication there's anything wrong until they get a CAT scan for a head injury<br>
or something like that and - whoops, nothing up there but water.  They do<br>
have problems with simultaneous attention, and probably other things as well,<br>
but you really wouldn't notice unless you looked carefully.<br>
<p>
Anyway, my point is that a lot of human intelligence apparently comes from<br>
language, memes, and participation in culture in general.  It's not just that<br>
we have big brains but that we use them well.<br>
