Good question. Most anarchists, myself included, think that defense against <br>
unfriendly nations is the single most difficult problem of all to answer. <br>
Of course, we wouldn't need to worry about an invading country if countries <br>
no longer existed, but as you point out, nation states are unlikely to die at <br>
the same time.<br>
<p>
There is no point in denying it, we will need to protect ourselves, when <br>
nations start to undergo death convulsions some may become downright nasty.  <br>
Protection costs money, I estimate it would take about 1/8 what an American  <br>
citizen now pay in taxes for defense to protect the continental USA. About <br>
half of the defense budget involves defending third parties in Europe, Japan, <br>
Australia etc for free, it takes government twice as much to do anything than <br>
anybody else and the army is about twice as big as it needs to be. That's <br>
about  1/40 of the what the US government extorts from taxes, remember the <br>
complete defense budget is only  about a fifth of  the total budget. That's <br>
still a lot of money, where will it come from? <br>
<p>
Every year people give billions of dollars to charities even though they gain <br>
no advantage from it. They also pay billions of dollars in tips, they don't <br>
have to but they do it because they think it's the right thing to do. I don't <br>
think it's crazy to say that they would do the  same thing for defense, <br>
especially since unlike charity and tipping it would help them directly.<br>
Perhaps additional money could come from offering protection services to <br>
other countries for a price. <br>
<p>
How can I guarantee that this voluntary army won't switch from being a <br>
protector to being an oppressor? I can't. I can't give you an iron clad  <br>
guarantee that the US Army wont overthrow the government and set up a  <br>
military dictatorship either. They certainly have the means to do so if they  <br>
wished to. I don't think that's very likely to happen, but it's far more <br>
likely than the sort of army I'm talking about doing it. The instant a<br>
voluntary army starts acting in a totalitarian way, shut off it's money <br>
supply and stop its cancerous growth in the bud. That is a powerful tool that <br>
we don't have today, with the US. Army you are forced to keep sending it <br>
money even if you hate what it's doing.  <br>
