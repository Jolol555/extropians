<p>
<i>&gt;Not very ardent, how about some dynamic optimism?</i><br>
<p>
Dynamic optimism leading to just wishful thinking is useless (or worse).<br>
 Dynamic optimism is useful only insofar as believing it gets you to do<br>
things that help you acheive your goals.  I should point out that Mr. Best is<br>
one of the most assiduous (but sensible) practitioners on the calorie<br>
restriction list, so his actions reflect a dynamic optimism and a real value<br>
on extended life.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; It is sometimes </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;hard to remember that FOREVER includes 10exp10exp1000 years from now. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Do I want to be alive in 10exp10exp1000 years? </i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I do.</i><br>
<p>
Nobody *knows* what they will want in even 200 years, never mind<br>
10exp10exp1000 years.  Nobody's ever lived that long.  People change over<br>
time, and we are, after all, only designed to go about 100 years max.  Over<br>
periods longer than the existence of the human race, who knows what you'll<br>
become?  At some point, you may want to check out.<br>
<p>
I'm quite confident I want a very extended lifespan, but not so arrogant as<br>
to assume I want to live forever.  I describe my current goal as "500 years<br>
with an option to extend".<br>
<p>
I'll also point out that normal human existance is about 80 years with<br>
significant deterioration towards the end.  There is, as yet, no *proof* that<br>
we can do better than that.  Plausible ideas, yes.  Wild speculation, yes.<br>
 But even saying that you will make it to 120 in full possession of your<br>
faculties is optimistic.<br>
