Dear Madam,<br>
<p>
I can only give you a few figures which give an order of magnitude.<br>
The Arithmom=E8tre, invented by Thomas de Colmar in 1820, was the first<br>
practical, industrially-produced computing machine.<br>
1821-1865 : 500 units produced in 44 years (in various workshops in Paris)<br>
1865-1878 : 1 000 machines in 13 years<br>
1865-1878 : 1 000 machines in 13 years.<br>
60% were exported, of which a few hundreds to the USA. How many of them<br>
were still in use in, say, 1880, for example ? and what percentage had been<br>
destroyed or lost ? Without answering such questions, we cannot measure<br>
"the computing machine calculations per person per year in the US".<br>
<p>
This is a typical case where precision is incompatible with exactitude,<br>
since there was no such thing as a statistics of statistical machines in<br>
the 19th century, not even in the 1st part of our century.<br>
<p>
Burroughs, with its three factories (11 000 employees) in US, Canada, UK,<br>
sold 120 000 machines/year, in 1919, for a revenue of $ 33 234 000 ; in<br>
1916 : 40 000 machines/year. Yet, Burroughs had many competitors, of which<br>
most have not bequeathed us with their records. Even Burroughs' figures<br>
(120 000...) are too square to be honest: They look more like commercial<br>
propaganda than like real production statistics. So, I admire the bold<br>
spirit whith which you plan to put together a chart!<br>
I will try to find more data for you. Meanwhile, I would be very grateful<br>
if you could tell me how you manage to solve the statistics problem!<br>
<p>
Yours sincerely,<br>
<p>
