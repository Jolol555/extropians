I think we do know it takes that long, if not many times longer.  All the<br>
really useful domesticated species I know of have been the object of<br>
deliberate breeding for at least five hundred years.  This includes cows,<br>
sheep, dogs, horses, cats, chickens, llamas, vicunas, ducks, rabbits, geese<br>
and guinea pigs.  Two cases where I might be wrong are carp, turkeys and<br>
ostriches.  Does anyone know how long ago people began to breed carp and<br>
turkeys?  I know ostrich farming was well-established a century ago, so if<br>
significant domestication has occured since then, that might indicate that<br>
it can be done in that short a time.<br>
<p>
Whoops!  Just thought of a counterexample to my own claim: lab rats and<br>
white mice have both been domesticated in the last century.  Of course, both<br>
these species have very short generation times.  So I think I can revise my<br>
claim to the following: no species has been domesticated in less than 500<br>
generations.  Here my definition of 'domesticated' is that I would walk<br>
through a paddock occupied by several of them, that I didn't know<br>
personally, without being worried.  Thus, honeybees, bison, and elephants<br>
are not domesticated.<br>
