<p>
This idea is mentioned in the book as a speculation by the characters,<br>
and Pham Nuwen says something of the sort as the Zonal surge is activated<br>
by Countermeasure.  "It was designed by something beyond the Powers.<br>
Maybe there are Cloud People, maybe this is signalling them.  Or maybe<br>
what it's done is like an insect bite, something that will cause a much<br>
greater reaction....  Oh, the ghost of Old One is amused.  Seeing beyond<br>
the Powers was almost worth dying for."<br>
<p>
As far as the Zones being there to protect other races from the Powers,<br>
I have a couple of problems with the idea.  First, one suggestion is that<br>
the primary purpose is to protect hypothetical intelligent gas clouds<br>
in the galactic core (the "Cloud People" in Nuwen's statement above).<br>
No explanation is given for why anyone would believe in the existence of<br>
these intelligent clouds.  Presumably no probes, automated or manned,<br>
could penetrate to the core and return.  Also, how could such clouds<br>
exist when all other forms of intelligence, machine or organic, are<br>
suppressed by the Unthinking Depths?  (Of course this gets into the<br>
implausibility of Zones putting a cap on intelligence or technology,<br>
which as far as I'm concerned is just the one impossibility we have to<br>
swallow to enjoy the story.)<br>
<p>
If the purpose of the Zones is instead to limit the Powers to the<br>
Transcend and leave most of the galaxy to lesser races, it seems<br>
like overkill.  Most of the interesting stuff goes on in the Beyond.<br>
The Slow Zone, which encompasses much of the galaxy where thinking can<br>
occur, allows only a limited standard of living to its inhabitants.<br>
<p>
If I were setting it up, I'd let the Beyond go all the way down to<br>
the core.  The Slow Zone seems like protection enough for any gas<br>
clouds.  Unimpressive "empires" like the Qeng Ho, with their ramscoops<br>
and generation ships, offer little enough threat.  And the deep Beyond<br>
should be relatively safe from the depradations of the Powers, while<br>
still allowing convenient interstellar travel and communication.<br>
<p>
Oh, well.  Someday I'll have a galaxy of my own to experiment with.  Then<br>
you'll see it done right...<br>
