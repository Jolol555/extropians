<i>&gt; From: hanson@hss.caltech.edu (Robin Hanson)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; and that you weren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; getting much value from posting, then of course you did well to change</i><br>
<i>&gt; your priorities.  But why must you assume we share your problems and</i><br>
<i>&gt; values?  Maybe most of us are making reasonable tradeoffs between</i><br>
<i>&gt; health, wealth, and enjoying life.  Part of enjoying life is</i><br>
<i>&gt; participating in communities such as this one.</i><br>
<p>
I in no way mean to suggest (and did not think I was suggesting) that<br>
one shouldn't subscribe to things like "extropians" or enjoy the<br>
fellowship of others.<br>
<p>
I was far more suggesting that many people spend their time far more<br>
in the "wouldn't it be neat if" rather than in the "how to" mode of<br>
thought, and dream of the future rather than following through and<br>
attempting to achieve the realization of their dreams.<br>
<p>
Not everyone, of course, need share the same values or desires. (The<br>
world economy works precisely because people have a diversity of<br>
desires and skills.) I would not suggest that every extropian become a<br>
computer programmer tomorrow or some such. <br>
<p>
I would, however, suggest this: achieving dreams is usually more<br>
satisfying that merely having them. Most Extropians dream of a life<br>
without end and without unreasonable constraints. A surprisingly large<br>
fraction, however, do very little in the way of attempting to actually<br>
achieve that sort of life for themselves. I don't believe in the<br>
concepts of universal good and evil, so I will not judge people for<br>
not attempting to achieve their dreams. I will, however, suggest that<br>
most people are happier if they actually are moving forward toward<br>
them rather than simply thinking about them.<br>
<p>
I will also point out that I did not start this thread. "Anonymous",<br>
whomever s/he is, did. I merely reacted to the way that, almost like a<br>
bunch of antibodies lining up against a foreign invader, or group of<br>
fundamentalist christians ganging up on someone discussing atheism,<br>
the list membership "rejected" the posting by "Anonymous" without<br>
giving it serious consideration. As I noted, some of the comments<br>
(like "selfishness isn't measured in dollars") seemed fairly inane --<br>
after all, the point was not "you should be more selfish" but instead<br>
"you may find yourself much happier if you have the financial means to<br>
achieve your personal goals".<br>
<p>
Since part of being an Extropian is (I would presume for most people)<br>
to achieve the sort of personal apotheosis dreamed of in "BEST DO IT<br>
SO", I would assume that criticism -- even self criticism -- would be<br>
an important part of Self Transformation. After all, to Self Transform<br>
implies 1) that you are not happy with your current world line, and<br>
that 2) you want to shift it in response to a critical analysis of<br>
what is wrong with your current condition.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; From: Steve Witham &lt;sw@tiac.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since most people think that ego is one of the main motivations that</i><br>
<i>&gt; drives rich people, maybe you could explain how it can do the reverse.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you think others might have similar problems involving ego?</i><br>
<p>
"Ego" in the colloquial sense doesn't usually drive people<br>
forward. Generally, I think it holds them back.<br>
<p>
People have an unhealthy tendency to become dogmatically attached to<br>
their ideas and their lifestyle. This tends to make people reject<br>
important information -- especially when the are incorrect. People<br>
frequently have trouble admitting *even to themselves* that their<br>
position is incorrect or that their actions are counterproductive. I<br>
attribute this to "ego" in the sense that often the problem is<br>
emotional attachment to one's world and world-view (often conflating<br>
one's self worth with the "truth" of one's ideas), and not an<br>
inability to think things through clearly *if one is willing to*.<br>
<p>
In my opinion, the beginning of wisdom is the ability to say "I was<br>
wrong about that -- I had better revise my closely held view based on<br>
the facts".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;would not have made any had I not recognized that a problem existed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perry, recognition like that that actually effects a person's life</i><br>
<i>&gt; is rare.  Something made it possible for you to see your life differently.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Probably, you already saw your life differently from the way any of us</i><br>
<i>&gt; see our lives.</i><br>
<p>
I'm possibly rather different from most people. I say "possibly"<br>
because I frankly don't know what other people's inner lives are like<br>
in this regard.<br>
<p>
For those that remember me, you may recall that I came to my current<br>
views (i.e. anarchocapitalism and the notion that the free market isn't<br>
just to be tolerated but that in fact "to be rich is glorious", to<br>
quote the new Chinese Communist Party mantra) as an adult, having<br>
spent many years as a self-acknowledged socialist. Over a period of<br>
time, however, I realized "I was wrong", and changed my viewpoint 180<br>
degrees. Such adult changes in world view happen, but they are hardly<br>
universal. I know many others who have not done the same even<br>
confronted with strong reason to do so.<br>
<p>
On many occasions I've had a sudden internal "snap" as I've realized<br>
"you know, that viewpoint that I've held is not just incorrect but<br>
actively damaging to my self interest -- I had better revise my<br>
thinking".<br>
<p>
I'm not certain that I'm particularly unusual in this respect, but<br>
I've noticed than many other people around me of all stripes *seem* to<br>
have a much higher tendency to bring ego into their decision making<br>
processes. They wrap their feeling of self worth in with their belief<br>
in the "correctness" of their world view or thinking, so it hurts to<br>
think "I was wrong" -- thus making them avoid that path of reasoning<br>
once they've made up their minds. This makes a "pan-critically<br>
rational" world view hard, because to be a pan-critical rationalist<br>
means that you have to be willing to accept the notion that tomorrow<br>
morning any of your closely cherished beliefs might suddenly be<br>
falsified.<br>
<p>
In my opinion (and this is just my opinion), to live well especially<br>
in a fast paced, ever changing world, you can't be overly attached to<br>
one's ideas or one's activities. You can work for six months or a year<br>
very hard on a project and have the conditions that made the project<br>
worthwhile disappear. You could be horribly devastated by this, but it<br>
won't make your life any better to do so. Similarly for ideas, people<br>
(nothing wrong with mourning but you can take the deaths of friends<br>
too far and torture yourself about their loss) or anything else. Every<br>
once in a while, one finds ones self confronting the approaching need<br>
to detach ones' self from something. Resisting changing one's opinion,<br>
habits, etc. for reasons of "ego" only causes more pain. You should,<br>
in my opinion, keep your goals in mind, rationally consider whether<br>
you should continue with your job, your course of study (or lack<br>
thereof), your world view, etc., and, if rational examination makes it<br>
look like it is getting in the way of where you want to be, let go.<br>
