<i>&gt; &gt;Any computer professional has heard of Moore's Law, first formulated by one</i><br>

<i>&gt; that date and proven to still be true today,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Moore's law is a rule of thumb, not a law of nature.  There have been other</i><br>
<i>&gt; periods of exponential growth in technological capacity, and they all came</i><br>
<i>&gt; to an end, usually without anyone realizing in advance that they were about</i><br>
<i>&gt; to.</i><br>
<p>
Usually it was politically imposed stagnation by reactionaries holding<br>
progress hostage to force change or to merely maintain the status quo.<br>
Technology has no limits save c.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Commercial air transport improved from 1903 to 1970 at an exponential clip,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and has made essentially no progress since.  Nobody had any idea in 1970</i><br>
<i>&gt; that progress was over.  If we were still on that curve, we'd have</i><br>
<i>&gt; commercial trips to the moon.  The movie '2001' was a plausible</i><br>
<i>&gt; extrapolation at the time.</i><br>
<p>
And if commercial supersonic flight were not illegal over continental<br>
landmasses, and the fuel embargo had not occured, we would still be on<br>
that curve. It was not a matter of technology. In fact, if you count our<br>
autonomous spaceflight technology, we are still on the curve. The<br>
Voyager and Galileo probes have acheived speeds over 100,000 mph. The<br>
only reason why men are not on those trips is that our risk averse and<br>
security happy society values free lunches for unmotivated ignoramuses<br>
more than exploring the universe.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What makes me confident that AI-level processing power is possible is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; (a) nature does it, and (b) Drexler has provided a carefully-worked analysis</i><br>
<i>&gt; of how it could be built.  The timing could be either faster or slower than</i><br>
<i>&gt; Moore's law suggests.  I would not be terribly surprised if economically</i><br>
<i>&gt; feasible semiconductor technology were to bog down after one or two more</i><br>
<i>&gt; chip generations.  The maximum speed of a Pentium might be 500 MHz for</i><br>
<i>&gt; decades, until someone develops a breakthrough technology.</i><br>
<p>
Sure there may by a maximum speed for that particular computer<br>
technology, but there is no reason other technologies will not surpass<br>
the Pentium chip as it becomes outmoded by economics. The present<br>
progress for quantum computing is an excellent indication that even<br>
greater speeds will be continuously attained.<br>

<p>
Nay, you merely help us reason out more convincing arguments.<br>
