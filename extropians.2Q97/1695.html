<i>&gt; Hi!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm glad to see there were so many replies to my message. Thank you all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; First of all, I'm going to the U.S. East Coast in August. I'm new to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this mailing list but I would sure like to meet some other extropians,</i><br>
<i>&gt; is there any of you in the East Coast in August willing to meet me?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; After reading your replies, I couldn't still form a conclusive opinion</i><br>
<i>&gt; (is there anybody who can?) but here's some of my thoughts and comments</i><br>
<i>&gt; on your replies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think we all agree that genes are selfish and care about us only to</i><br>
<i>&gt; create more like them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; One divergent opinion was weather a gene that codes for extra longevity</i><br>
<i>&gt; is good or evil? (in terms of reproductive success)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My opinion is that it is good. If one organism lives longer, it has a</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher chance to produce more offspring and therefore it is a good gene.</i><br>
<i>&gt; It's as simple as that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; William Wiser wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Most of human evolution took place when old age was not a common cause of death</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; so it really did not help a lot to have a long natural life span.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You're making a mistake, you are assuming that aging is only the decayed</i><br>
<i>&gt; state humans reach at their 70s, 80s, etc. This is not truth, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; chances of a primitive human (or other mammal) to survive decrease due</i><br>
<i>&gt; to aging after he reaches puberty (that is why primitive humans never</i><br>
<i>&gt; died from the aging you name, they died at the first signs of aging).</i><br>
<i>&gt; So, a non-aging primitive human should have an advantage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Anders Sandberg wrote this Medawar suggestion:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; living longer would be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; slight disadvantage (competition of resources)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The gene is selfish, it only cares about himself and it is not going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; kill himself as an altruistic act to favour others. The gene will</i><br>
<i>&gt; continually create more copies, that is his mission.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally, Lee Daniel Crocker wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Evolution is a pretty simple mathematical phenomenon once you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; understand it.  When applied to living organisms, it's quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; clear that immoratility serves no purpose to a gene's survival,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and in fact is detrimental in many cases.  Once's you're done</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reproducing, your body is no longer useful to your genes' further</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; replication, so no evolutionary pressure to continue is present.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Evolution serves the replicators (genes, roughly speaking),</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not organisms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If aging is not present, reproduction is never done, the body is always</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful to the genes and evolutionary preassure is always present.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If, indeed, a gene that codes for extra longevity is an advantage, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; isn't it present?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't know. The species that do not endure aging are very primitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones, perhaps in mammals it is much more complex and since with aging we</i><br>
<i>&gt; can still reproduce, the species continues. Perhaps to stop aging is so</i><br>
<i>&gt; complex that it will take millions or billions of years for aging to</i><br>
<i>&gt; naturally stop (although the consequences would be disastrous). Let's</i><br>
<i>&gt; see what we have to say about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I would say that the evolved average lifespan was arrived at by<br>
offsetting the human reproductive rate against the death rate, such that<br>
we naturally live long enough (counting disease, accidents, and<br>
predation) only enough to allow a stable population under normal<br>
circumstances. Too long a natural lifespan, and we would have seen in<br>
prehistorical archeological times, periods of population explosion and<br>
contraction similar to the deer/wolf population interaction. As we can<br>
see in the present, by technologically changing this dynamic, we are<br>
risking our species survival because we are all living too long, and too<br>
many of our children are surviving to reproduce...<br>
<p>
If we wanted to evolve longer natural lifespans, we would have to have a<br>
lower rate of reproduction, possibly in a lower average sperm count, or<br>
in a longer menstrual cycle, or in an earlier onset of menopause. A<br>
later onset of puberty would not be useful, as it would allow the<br>
accumulation of greater resources by individuals prior to reproducing,<br>
thus ensuring greater probability of survival of the next generation.<br>
