"Should" and "is" aren't necessarily what happens in the IPO biz. Brealy<br>
and Myers may be theoretically right in the old corporate finance textbook<br>
(they also say there's no difference, from a financial prospective, between<br>
equity and debt, for instance), but the market doesn't happen in a bluebook<br>
exam.<br>
<p>
IPOs, especially larger ones like Iridium's, are usually sold to<br>
institutional investors in order to get the issue out the door quickly.<br>
Unfortunately, these very institutional investors usually don't hang onto<br>
these IPOs for long, preferring instead to "flip" the hot ones into the<br>
market after a few days or even hours, in order to turn a quick profit. So,<br>
typically, the investment bank underprices the IPO to make it "flippable"<br>
as a way to "reward" the institutions for being such good customers,<br>
especially for all the times they've bought into secondary issues of big<br>
boring existing companies, like, say, a bond issue for Kodak or IBM or GE.<br>
<p>
Of course, there's also the company management, who is usually more<br>
concerned with getting the stock issued as quickly as possible, and so they<br>
tend to think with their pants than with their heads when it comes to an<br>
offering price. Offering disasters, like the recent Wired magazine<br>
floatation, tend to stick out more in the minds of a company's management<br>
than the 'macroeconomic' effect of the investment bank shortchanging their<br>
existing shareholders on an IPO which will change the shareholder list<br>
drastically anyway.<br>
<p>
As a result, I bet that offerings of companies in which the management and<br>
employees of the company are the sole shareholders are more efficiently<br>
priced than a company whose shareholders are venture caps and institutions.<br>
Microsoft would be a good case in point, because all the shareholders were<br>
employees and managers, and the company was completely bootstrapped from<br>
day one. MS only went public because their population of stock option<br>
holders exceeded the regulatory maximum for a privately held corporation.<br>
They had more money than they could spend at the time, and so they probably<br>
wanted the best price possible. OTOH, the investment bank had all those<br>
institutional customers itching to flip whatever MS shares they could get...<br>
<p>
:-).<br>
