 I don't buy the past life part, but all people seem to react<br>
<i>&gt; strongly to signals that threaten their identity or peace of mind, </i><br>
<p>
	Would this apply to people who are secure in their own identity and peace<br>
of 	mind, especially those who have "reprogrammed" themselves or were not <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; wading through the New Age fluff trying to find something that might</i><br>
<i>&gt; actually be useful for 'mental discipline' (better, non-mystical term?)</i><br>
<i>&gt; exercises.</i><br>
<p>
	Have you considered "Mind Magic" by Bill Harvey?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Darwinian evolution has made us adept of tracking gaze direction, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; interpreting subliminal body language and face mimics. Basic survial</i><br>
<i>&gt; skills, in other words. It wouldn't have skipped a clue that crucial. So</i><br>
I<br>
<i>&gt; gather it does not exist. </i><br>
<p>
	Why is it that people blind from birth can "feel" moods?  Why is it that<br>
some birth-blind people develop the ability to "see auras" ?<br>
