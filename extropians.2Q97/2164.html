Lee Daniel Crocker asserted:<br>
<p>
There is no such thing as "enough" or "plenty"; they are menaingle=<br>
ss abstractions.<br>
<p>
Rick Knight replied:<br>
*Enough* is when you aren't devoting energy to a particular goal or<br>
desire.  As in full or satiated.<br>
<p>
*Plenty* is when you can comfortably/benevolently redirect your fo=<br>
cus and consider the needs/desires of others or embellish/expand your <br>
own. As in comfort or even abundance.<br>
<p>
I have applied meaning to your absolutist assertion of no meaning =<br>
and request that you devote a modicum of time/energy to address Mr. Wiser's <br>
question with some respect and consideration.  Otherwise, =<br>
it would be more beneficial to simply refrain because credibility expressed <br>
in the motif you've chosen is seriously lacking.<br>
<p>
Daniel then countered:<br>
<p>
The topic was money.  The word "enough" is certainly useful when<br>
talking about things that can be satiated, like food or sex, or<br>
things that have physical limits (the speed of light is fast enough).<br>
But when the subject is money, I continue to assert that "enough"<br>
cannot be meaningfully applied, because money is by definition that<br>
which one uses to satisfy one's goals, and there is no limit to<br>
goals except failure of imagination.<br>
<p>
Rick&gt;&gt; The last statement I concur with.  My definitions of enough and <br>
plenty served as a countermeasure to a proliferation of sentiments of what <br>
appear to be avarice and self-centered notions (not on your part, per se, <br>
more a theme that runs with this list).  <br>
<p>
Daniel&gt;&gt; I answered the questions put honestly, meaningfully, and with some <br>
effort put into the ideas and wording.  If you think otherwise,<br>
then please provide evidence or refrain from making baseless<br>
accusations.  <br>
<p>
Rick&gt;&gt; "accusations" is a meaning you ascribe.  The tone of your reply to <br>
Mr. Wiser I *interpret* to be abstract and terse and he has rephrased his <br>
query in the latest digest.  Hopefully, his revision will engage even more <br>
honest and meaningful responses because I regard it to be an intriguing <br>
mental exercise.  <br>
<p>
I have no quarrel with you and certainly am not going to expend anymore <br>
energy digging into the semantics to cite precisely where you ran aground <br>
in my opinion.  Take it on that you just might be perceived with a less <br>
than congenial attitude in this driest-of-dry communication mediums.  My <br>
opinion is not the truth. I won't come and conviscate your computer for <br>
perceived impoliteness. &lt;G&gt; I disagree with the absolutist assertion that <br>
*enough money* is meaningless.  Of course, I also envision a world beyond <br>
the market economy paradigm.  <br>
<p>
IMHO, money still represents a notion of clinging to a survivalist and <br>
individualist mentality and as long as it serves as the medium for one <br>
person having more than another, mimicking natural selection while we, the <br>
privileged species with the opposable thumbs and the developed brain stems <br>
shrug it off as okay (pause, breath)...as long as it is equated with the <br>
"natural order of things", we are relegated to a world of material-based <br>
angst.  Extropian or not, that's hardly an ideal world and I want more.  <br>
Perhaps I should classify myself as a Extro-Utopian &lt;G&gt;.<br>
<p>
Daniel&gt;&gt; If you want to attack the ideas, I welcome that, but to attack my <br>
motives shows that your reasoning is too weak to stand on its own.<br>
<p>
Rick&gt;&gt; Curious tactic but I respectfully decline.  I think we can put this <br>
one to bed and move on to more intriguing banter...as long as you're clear <br>
I'm just another harmless guy on a chatty and pontifical digest espousing <br>
anything and everything because it's an amusing distraction and (at times) <br>
an engaging mental exercise.<br>
