This is the dilemma .  When does 'protection of the minority' infringe<br>
upon the 'rights of the majority'?  In the US the minority often imposes<br>
laws over the majority.  When does ANY belief system ('religion' or<br>
government) start taking on aspects of dictatorship?  How do we prevent<br>
it?<br>
<p>
My opinion is that it happens when laws are passed based on emotion<br>
rather than NOT being passed because logicially it doesn't make sense.<br>
When emotion becomes the main issue then common sense has been<br>
abandoned.  This is because one side cannot convince enough of the<br>
population in a logical manner that the one side is right, so emotion is<br>
appealed to.  Many completely idiotic things can be made law based on<br>
emotion.  Logically they make no sense.  <br>
<p>
When ANY group appeals to emotion enough to start making the majority<br>
start agreeing with it based on emotion then emotion becomes the driving<br>
force.  'Don't THINK, FEEL!'.  You can get widely seperate groups<br>
agreeing based on a narrow emotion where if individually you thought out<br>
the consequences of such action you'd totally reject it.<br>
<p>
There are several laws in the US that remind me of this:<br>
<p>
(The dumbest I can think of is the current possibility of it becoming<br>
illegal to burn the US flag.  A totally emotional thing.  I care about<br>
how the banks are screwing me, I don't give a rat's ass about Joe Blow<br>
burning the US flag.  Does congress really think flag burning is a wide<br>
spread activity?  How many people will it involve?  Certainly nowhere<br>
near the folk being screwed by their 'friendly local bank'!)<br>
<p>
Abortion is kinda legal.  However, if the mother wants an abortion the<br>
fetus is considered tissue and can be aborted.  If the mother does NOT<br>
want an abortion the fetus is considered a human.Law:  In the US if<br>
you're involved in an accident that causes the spontaneous abortion and<br>
death of an unborn infant you can be sent to jail for involuntary<br>
manslaughter, even though BY LAW, the unborn infant can be considered<br>
'tissue'.  Emotions are involved.  (Amazingly, this 'manslaughter' law<br>
was NOT passed until abortion became legal!)<br>
<p>
'Drunk driving is illegal'.  This is based purely on blood alcohol<br>
content (BAC).<br>
In the US 50% of all traffic deaths involves at least one driver having<br>
an 'illegal' BAC.  This is appealed to in the courts and legislatures.<br>
This TOTALLY assumes you can't add and deduce you're as likely to be<br>
killed by a sober driver as one who has been drinking!  (I'm sure there<br>
IS a percentage of traffic deaths due solely to drinking, but it is<br>
nowhere near 50%.)   In other words, according to the statistics it's<br>
'How you drive more than what you imbibe' because if you drive like an<br>
idiot sober you'll drive like an idiot after drinking.  However,<br>
EVERYONE who drinks and drives is considered a criminal, even though YOU<br>
might be safer on the road with a BAC of .1 over some fool who<br>
disreguards all common sense and drives aggressively (and WILL<br>
eventually kill someone) and has a BAC of .00.  Some fanatics will argue<br>
'but the none drunks had mechanical failures or driving conditions were<br>
bad or ...... The idiocy about this is that when ANY driver that has<br>
been drinking (BAC over .00) is involved in an accident the mechanical<br>
or driving conditions are disreguarded.   In fact, even if the drinking<br>
driver IS NOT AT FAULT he/she IS CONSIDERED AT FAULT just because he/she<br>
has been drinking!  How logical is that?  It's the emotion of the 'evil<br>
drunk driver' that encourages such law.  Remember, logic has no bearing.<br>
 We have been appealed to emotionally that drinking causes death when<br>
the statistics themselves prove it's driving habits (US anyway).  I<br>
guess US citizens will only understand this when it's illegal (AGAIN) to<br>
consume alcohol and 100% of all traffic deaths are due to sober drivers<br>
who drive like idiots, or we realise the reduction of traffic deaths is<br>
due more to the fact that automobiles themselves are safer and are the<br>
major cause of reduced deaths rather than a criminalization of drinking.<br>
<p>
US:<br>
The Constitution guarantees 'freedom of speech'...included to allow any<br>
citizen to speak out against the government.<br>
In the 19-teens or 1920's the 'Un-American Law' was passed (by those in<br>
power which BTW had also passed laws requiring a certain percentage of<br>
the population wanting you to before you could even be considered<br>
elligible for election...in other words, 'everyone was elligible' was<br>
taken away, you had to belong to an accepted 'political party' (group of<br>
"TRUE BELIEVERS") instead of what you believed in) of which allowed the<br>
state to arrest anyone speaking out against the government.  Many of the<br>
Americans who loved democracy AND America were arrested in the 1960's<br>
using this law (and by the way, still are).<br>
<p>
What scares me most is most people have given into the emotional thing<br>
(when the HELL were we brainwashed?) and allow such things.<br>
<p>
Oh, don't forget, there are VERY FEW (if any) democracies in the world,<br>
most (including the US) are republics (YOUR vote means squat, the person<br>
you voted for vote means EVERYTHING and he/she generally cares about<br>
him/her-self in his/her political power game).<br>
<p>
I won't even go into the educational system.<br>
