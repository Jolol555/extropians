<p>
It sounds like you are making assumptions. I chose Coca Cola because I am<br>
reasonably familiar with the management and the major changes they made<br>
several years ago, and because I have discussed the company with those who<br>
know much about it and have been convinced that it has long-term growth<br>
still ahead of it.<br>
<p>
The same (only more so) would have been true if I had bought Microsoft,<br>
which I certainly would have done if its stock hadn't been at an all-time<br>
high (though still a good value). I know more about Microsoft, how it's run<br>
and its markets, than I know about any other company. With almost any other<br>
company, your comment would be correct -- I know too little about<br>
practically any other company to base an investment decision on it (rather<br>
than simply a gamble). Apart from two or three companies, my knowledge is<br>
such that I would buy a broad index fund rather than individual company<br>
stocks. (If I could afford it, I might make an exception for Berkshire<br>
Hathaway, but then that would be like buying several companies....)<br>
