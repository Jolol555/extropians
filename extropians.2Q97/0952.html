<p>
Yes, most papers are hard to understand even for the experts, especially <br>
since there are plenty of subtlities of methodology to take into account. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; My approach was to </i><br>
<i>&gt; get *just* a general, vague description of these substances, try them, </i><br>
<i>&gt; and *only then* compare my experiences the annecdotes.  This was the </i><br>
<i>&gt; closest I could come to a 'blinded' study.</i><br>
<p>
Well, that would likely convince you about some of the substances, but it <br>
would not be a valid test and it would not really tell us anything about <br>
how well they actually work (we need blind testing for that). Of course, <br>
it is much better than reading the hype and believing it. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  The purpose of my post, </i><br>
<i>&gt; yesterday, on nicotine was to illustrate just how extremely difficult </i><br>
<i>&gt; and expensive it would be to document all the complex interactions </i><br>
<i>&gt; related to these substances in a completely scientific and useful </i><br>
<i>&gt; way.</i><br>
<p>
Yes, and nicotine is still one of the best researched substances. That it<br>
has nootropic effects appears quite clear, but these effects are quite<br>
complex and not all positive. In general, the idea of nootropics only<br>
having positive cognitive effects and no side-effects is *very* unlikely,<br>
although some drugs likely will be able to come close in some respects. <br>
After all, if a substance improved my working memory at the expense of<br>
perception, I might be interested in using it anyway under certain<br>
conditions. <br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; IOW, as long as the danger appears to be minimal, better to just do </i><br>
<i>&gt; your own experiments rather than waste hundreds of hours combing the </i><br>
<i>&gt; medical literature or waiting years and years for objective, </i><br>
<i>&gt; non-commercial studies that may never be conducted.</i><br>
<p>
Well, it is your money and body. But I think it is stupid to not attempt <br>
to find out more about what you try to use before using it - after all, <br>
most of the claims are quite unfounded, and there are some dangers even <br>
in quite safe supplements. <br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In my earlier response to litenite I gave an example of a current </i><br>

<p>
Me too. But I would likely turn into one of the gargoyles in _Snow Crash_ :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; SO, the next step, and my idea for one of the first practical </i><br>
<i>&gt; semi-implant devices, would be subvocalizing speech-activation device. </i><br>
<p>
Yes, this seems to be a nice idea. I am not entirely sure this can't be <br>
done using a microphone taped to the throat or something similar, but it <br>
might be useful for some people. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;  On second thought, this could probably just be some sort of necklace. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I was thinking that this would be something implanted in the throat </i><br>
<i>&gt; with some sort of lead coming out through the skin to connect to an </i><br>
<i>&gt; external electronic device.  Still, some type of simple implant such </i><br>
<i>&gt; as this with an external connection that avoids infectious and </i><br>
<i>&gt; immunolgical problems would be an nice advance (unless something </i><br>
<i>&gt; similar has already been done?)</i><br>
<p>
I don't know if anybody has done it, but I will look into the subject. <br>
The big problem is having leads penetrating the skin, that is a real mess <br>
and somewhat dangerous. It might be possible to send signals through <br>
telemetry instead (like some pacemakers do). An even more ambitious <br>
version would be an implant that read cortical activity and sent it to a <br>
receiver; it *might* be possible to get useful information from that, but <br>
I'm not sure.<br>
