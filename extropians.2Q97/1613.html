Joao Pedro asks:<br>
<i> &gt; I would like to know your opinion about why are we allowed to age? </i><br>
<i> &gt; Why, after millions of years of evolution, we still age?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not a real biologist and I don't even play one on TV, but our<br>
genes don't give a damn if we age, as long as *they* keep going.<br>
<i>&gt;From the gene's point of view, the biological struggle between the</i><br>
generations is very real, and once Mom and Pop have done a good<br>
job of getting the tyrannical little genes into young Boomer, then<br>
as far as the gene is concerned, goodbye Mom and Pop! Especially<br>
if they're competing with young Boomer for foraging territory.<br>
<p>
The gene follows John K. Clark's theory of identity to a tee: one<br>
copy is as good as any other, and a copy in a young hale-and-hearty<br>
organism is a better bet for immortality than the copies in Mom<br>
and Pop.<br>
<p>
(I shouldn't cite John K. Clark's theory of identity when explaining<br>
something to someone new to the list, but I'm sure he'll be happy<br>
to elucidate. Chalk it up to my intellectual orneriness.)<br>
