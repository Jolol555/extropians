!!!!!????? Gamma at the density of lead? Now this is so wildly ridiculous,<br>
it fails even to send a shiver down my spine. <br>
<p>
Which processes can be _that_ energetic? Even if we assume colliding<br>
neutron stars, travelling at their usual kinetical + gravitational<br>
potential energy, and assume a high conversion efficiency (several <br>
10%) to gamma, intuitively this doesn't suffice. I don't have<br>
Carl's envelopes at the house, could anyone give some ballpark figures<br>
on energetics of such events?<br>
<p>
If a hole eats a pulsar in one fell gulp, how much energy is released<br>
then? And why does my every darn sentence seem to end with a question<br>
mark, today? <br>
<p>
Since we are at the holes, and evaporating primeval singularties should<br>
give a fair gamma flash (how fast? did somebody record the GBR spectral<br>
changes)? before winking out, can one look out of them? (But these should<br>
be very rapid, and extremely faint, being observable just in low lightyear<br>
range). <br>
