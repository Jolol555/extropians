<p>
 Do parents usually have more interest in the welfare of asexually<br>
produced children than in sexually produced children? There are<br>
obvious cases in which the answer is yes (DNA-controlled organisms<br>
or software that normally reproduces by making exact copies), but it<br>
isn't obvious that those cases will predominate in the future, or<br>
that asexual reproduction will predominate.<br>
 Asexual reproduction has always been possible for DNA. DNA has evolved<br>
the more expensive sexual reproduction because it produces better<br>
adaptation. I haven't seen any reason to think that a permanent change<br>
to this principle is about to happen (although short term fluctuations<br>
in the ratio of asexual to sexual reproduction are likely as new reproduction<br>
mechanisms are tried).<br>
 Even if a large surge in direct copying of life happens, I'm uncertain<br>
whether that means the "parent" has more interest in the "child"'s welfare<br>
than with asexual reproduction. If I've already made 1000 direct copies<br>
of myself but only one sexually produced child, will copy #1001 really<br>
be more valuable than unique child #2? Under natural selection as it has<br>
worked for biological organisms, the answer would clearly be yes if we<br>
ignore the adaptive benefits I mentioned in the prior paragraph. But I<br>
suspect that depends on all organisms having roughly equal impact on the<br>
system. I can imagine a trillion copies of myself dominating any analysis<br>
that measures an "average" individual, but being irrelevant to the behavior<br>
of society because most copies are kept isolated as part of experiments<br>
I'm running. (Or is it only the aggregate value of the offspring rather<br>
than the marginal value of the next offspring that matters for the effects<br>
you mention?)<br>
<p>
 [Apologies for the slowness of my responses; I've been working too hard].<br>
