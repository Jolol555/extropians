<i>&gt; There are lots of urban legends out there about great inventions that have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been suppressed by The Powers That Be.  In these stories, They seem to use</i><br>
<i>&gt; threats, media blackouts, and murders that look like accidents.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to believe that all such stories are bunk.  However, there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; another way to suppress an invention: licence the patent, and then don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; manufacture it.  This is entirely legal, though people don't tend to talk</i><br>
<i>&gt; about it, as it is anti-social. Does anyone know of a time when this has</i><br>
<i>&gt; definitely happened?</i><br>
<p>
The US tried to do this with the RSA cryptosystem, which was at one time<br>
patented by Public Key Partners, who made no software and issued no<br>
licenses.  That effort failed, but they are still trying to supress it<br>
with ITAR, preventing export.  That too will fail, miserably, despite<br>
support from Congress and the White House, because international<br>
competition won't allow us the luxury of not using something as important<br>
economically as public key encryption.  They'll try their damnedest, and<br>
may keep it down for a short time, but eventually they will fail.  You<br>
just can't stop the momentum of economically important discoveries.<br>
