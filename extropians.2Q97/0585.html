<i>&gt; &gt;  the word "stolen", but if that gets in the way of your ability to apply</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  ordinary reason to an assertion, then go ahead and pick a less loaded</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  word for your own use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No I do not have a problem with your assertion of education being badly</i><br>
<i>&gt; managed by the government. Or of taxation being unfair.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The MAJOR difference - which you appanrently missed - is pointing out that</i><br>
<i>&gt; SOME people, not you.. not Mr. Lorrey, not most Libertarians, but this one..</i><br>
<i>&gt; see value in educating people who have no money. In making education</i><br>
<i>&gt; available at OUR OWN EXPENSE to others who have  children but may ( for some</i><br>
<i>&gt; stupid reason) think their children don;t deserve it. I said this is my own</i><br>
<i>&gt; SELFISH desire for a better society.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would gladly pay a part of my salary to educate your kid, if you were</i><br>
<i>&gt; stupid enough to want him to NOT go to school - or if you were a poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; provider. I want public education to survive, even if I do ( and I do ) have</i><br>
<i>&gt; my kids in private schools.  Even if that "public" education is privately</i><br>
<i>&gt; funded.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
I don't even have a problem with public funding of education. Its the<br>
monopoly of the market that I find so objectionable and in my opinion,<br>
the big cause of the problems with our public primary education. As<br>
previously stated by me, publicly funded college education is very good<br>
in most areas of the US. Excellent in some. Because individual public<br>
colleges do not have a monopoly on the students resident in their state,<br>
they have IMHO retained a level of quality that one normally sees with<br>
free market services, while the monopolistic primary schools have not.<br>
<p>
Likewise, the tax system should have a way out for people who live by<br>
their principles, much like concientious objectors to military service.<br>
There is currently a form one can fill out at the IRS certifying that<br>
the signor is a member of a religion that has such objections to social<br>
security. In exchange for being exampt from paying SS taxes, you refuse<br>
permanently any rights to benefits. If this method were expanded to CO<br>
types, I think that present society will survive handily, while people<br>
who object to confiscation as much as the founding fathers did can live<br>
in peace.<br>
<p>
Its time for an anti-trust lawsuit against the federal government.<br>
