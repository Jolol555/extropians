<i>&gt;Technocracy was invented back in the '30s.  It was yet another mass movement</i><br>
<i>&gt;to reform the society and economy along rational, centralized lines, just</i><br>
<i>&gt;like Fascism and Communism. [...]</i><br>
<p>
Yeah, Marx was big on science, too: he thought that 1) the free<br>
market is too random because it relies on people "just happening to"<br>
produce goods and services that meet needs--so freedom needs to be<br>
replaced with science, and 2) that what he was doing was not "ideology,"<br>
ideas made to rationalize someone's particular interests, but "science,"<br>
pure and unbiased.  (Or course then he spoiled it by saying things<br>
like, "Workers of the world, unite!" and "The point, however, is to change<br>
things.")<br>
<p>
The way that "science" figures into people's insanities is very interesting.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;PS. The word 'technocrat' was reappropriated lately, primarily by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;magazine Economist, to refer to a dispassionate and number-oriented style of</i><br>
<i>&gt;economic/political management. [...]</i><br>

Hmm.  Here's the definition of "technocracy" from my 1949 dictionary:<br>
"Government by technical experts."  It doesn't even mention the movement.<br>
But two dictionaries from 1989 and 1991 do. One says the movement was<br>
"prominent about 1932."  The other says the word was coined in 1919.<br>
<p>
I thought "technocrat," meaning any techie in a controlling position, went<br>
way back.  Some guy at a desk looking at numbers and uncaringly making<br>
decisions that affect your life.  Like an insurance actuary.<br>
