<i>&gt;Subject: 	Net censorship, access cost increase, and IntellectualProperty</i><br>
<i>&gt;alert!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Net censorship, access cost increase, and Intellectual Property alert!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Every netizen or organization that wants low cost net access, net </i><br>
<i>&gt;free speech, and uncensored e-mail has a high stake in a court </i><br>
<i>&gt;case soon to be decided in the litigation war involving Scientology,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Internet, and a nonprofit electronic library and historic archive </i><br>
<i>&gt;called FactNet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;An emergency Internet and legal issues briefing has been prepared for </i><br>
<i>&gt;you and/or your organization at (www.factnet.org).  Factnet's Board of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Directors urgently asks your help to  promote both media coverage and </i><br>
<i>&gt;a vigorous dialogue among netizens on the immediate and substantial </i><br>
<i>&gt;threat this briefing discloses to the future of the Internet. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To help understand the importance of this briefing to Internet costs, </i><br>
<i>&gt;Internet slowdowns, Internet intellectual property and Internet free </i><br>
<i>&gt;speech please find the following media quotes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"If the church's (Scientology's) lawsuits prevail...future providers </i><br>
<i>&gt;of bulletin boards and newsgroups on the World Wide Web, as well as </i><br>
<i>&gt;the companies running such subscriber services as Prodigy, Compuserve, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and America Online might be forced to monitor or restrict information</i><br>
<i>&gt;simply because they fear being sued...If system operators are liable for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the content of the postings, it will lead to censorship...It would change</i><br>
<i>&gt;the whole idea of how the Internet develops -- it's that important." </i><br>
<i>&gt;--Shari Steele, attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;quoted in "The Net: Copyright or 'Free Press'?" Newsday, 10/10/95</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Besides the technological curtailment of free speech, a skirmish like</i><br>
<i>&gt;this one has the potential to completely disrupt the online operation not</i><br>
<i>&gt;only of individual users, but also of entire networks overloaded by</i><br>
<i>&gt;traffic their circuits were never designed to handle."  </i><br>
<i>&gt;--Colman Jones, "Freedom Flames Out on the 'Net: Who Launched the </i><br>
<i>&gt;largest-ever Sabotage of the Internet?" </i><br>
<i>&gt;www.now.com/issues/15/44/News/feature.html </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Other [Internet] users have reported mysterious incidents: investigators</i><br>
<i>&gt; visiting their neighbors, strangers attempting to get into their telephone</i><br>
<i>&gt;records, e-mail sent to their sysadmins asking that their accounts be</i><br>
<i>&gt;closed down. How did we get to this, in a free country?...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"It turns out that a belief in free speech and an interest in </i><br>
<i>&gt;Scientology may involve you in the bitterest battle fought across </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Internet to date. A fight that has burst the banks of the Net </i><br>
<i>&gt;and into the real world of police,lawyers, and armed search and </i><br>
<i>&gt;seizure. Ultimately, however, the drama doesn't matter: the real </i><br>
<i>&gt;issues here are the boundaries of free speech and the future of </i><br>
<i>&gt;copyright and intellectual property in the face of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology that can scatter copies across the world in seconds...</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Whatever the motives, when computers are seized because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;contain allegedly purloined intellectual property, messages are</i><br>
<i>&gt;intercepted as they traverse the network, or the security of anonymous</i><br>
<i>&gt;remailers is pierced by police, the days of the Internet as a cozy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;private, intellectual cocktail party are over. .." </i><br>
<i>&gt;--Wendy M. Grossman, "alt.scientology.war," Wired, 8/95</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Lest anyone doubt Scientology's intentions, an article in the most </i><br>
<i>&gt;recent issue of an internal Scientology magazine called "High Winds" </i><br>
<i>&gt;proudly trumpets "groundbreaking lawsuits against both copyright </i><br>
<i>&gt;infringers and the computer service companies that served as </i><br>
<i>&gt;electronic conduits" for them. It goes on to predict "landmark </i><br>
<i>&gt;decisions" in which, "for the first time, Internet access providers </i><br>
<i>&gt;will be held responsible for any copyright infringements posted </i><br>
<i>&gt;through their facilities."  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"The Internet is an information age tool that empowers individuals and</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduces the need for a large, authoritarian government. It empowers the</i><br>
<i>&gt;poor with an unregulated world of entrepreneurial opportunity... </i><br>
<i>&gt;Information and the new frontier could create a more fair, peaceful </i><br>
<i>&gt;society The free flow of information is central to America's foundation, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and '90s technology only enhances it. Unfortunately, it's all big threat</i><br>
<i>&gt;to those in power who rely on the control of information to secure </i><br>
<i>&gt;their lofty positions. No matter what they call it, free speech is the </i><br>
<i>&gt;issue." --Wayne Langsen, "Raiding Free Speech," Boulder Weekly editorial. </i><br>
<i>&gt;                8/24/95 </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;PLEASE help protect our mutual Internet freedoms by appropriately </i><br>
<i>&gt;forwarding this briefing to your personal or organizational network </i><br>
<i>&gt;of individuals, newsgroups, listservs, net media, and net watch </i><br>
<i>&gt;organizations where it hasn't appeared yet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your timely attention to this critical briefing is appreciated,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Directors of Factnet</i><br>
<i>&gt;Boulder Colorado USA</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;P.S. Factnet has been reconstructing its electronic files since they </i><br>
<i>&gt;were sabotaged and returned to us by court order after the Scientology </i><br>
<i>&gt;raid. Our original mailing lists consisted of individuals and organizations </i><br>
<i>&gt;who had viewed materials or had an interest in Scientology's Internet </i><br>
<i>&gt;abuses and other human rights abuses. Because of the raid we are not </i><br>
<i>&gt;fully certain that our reconstructed mailing lists contain what they </i><br>
<i>&gt;originally contained or have been reassembled back into the proper lists. </i><br>
<i>&gt;These reconstructed mailing lists are far to important to the battle for </i><br>
<i>&gt;Internet free speech not to begin using again just because they were in </i><br>
<i>&gt;Scientology's possession.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you have received this alert and you have not previously reviewed or </i><br>
<i>&gt;been interested in any information on these issues let us know and we </i><br>
<i>&gt;will immediately correct the situation. We ask your understanding if </i><br>
<i>&gt;there has been an error or duplicate mailing. Try to imagine someone </i><br>
<i>&gt;illegally seizing all of your computers and computer files then searching </i><br>
<i>&gt;and altering and destroying parts of them. Finally you get it all back </i><br>
<i>&gt;to you in boxes and pieces. That's what happened to Factnet. Over the </i><br>
<i>&gt;last 12 months with minimal resources it has had to reconstruct 6 </i><br>
<i>&gt;gigabits of its deliberately disordered returned libraries and files.  </i><br>
