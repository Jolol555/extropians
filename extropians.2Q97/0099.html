FBI HARASSMENT, DEATH THREATS, AND ELECTRONIC WARFARE<br>
<p>
Yesterday the FBI hit Richard Russell again. Richard is <br>
the former American Airlines pilot who acquired the FAA <br>
TWA 800 radar tape that the FBI seized a few weeks ago.<br>
This time they hit him with a subpoena to appear before <br>
the federal grand jury in charge of intimidating the <br>
real TWA 800 investigators. They will force him to <br>
reveal who gave him the radar tape that allowed<br>
the American people to have a glimpse of the <br>
forbidden truth, before the FBI rehid it.<br>
<p>
ELECTRONIC WARFARE<br>
<p>
The last time the FBI hit Rich they shutdown both his Net accounts:<br>
<a href="http://home.dc.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9703">http://home.dc.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9703</a>&amp;L=flight-800&amp;O=A&amp;P=9098<br>
Today several private messages sent to me are arriving to me not <br>
from their actual sender, but from Kai Liu &lt;kailiu@wam.umd.edu&gt; <br>
with a CC: list a mile long.  In short: private emails sent to me <br>
from friends are being intercepted before they get to me and are <br>
being sent to the public and me. An act of electronic aggression.<br>
<p>
Since my post about the death threats against me from military <br>
intelligence (<a href="http://www.thnet.com/~deckard/dthreat1.htm">http://www.thnet.com/~deckard/dthreat1.htm</a>), I've <br>
been getting bombed heavily with huge junk mail posts with mile <br>
long CC: lists, in fact, it seems they are the same CC: lists <br>
as the my intercepted private emails are bring sent to. <br>
Gee, what a coincidence. <br>
<p>
I got a dialog box message when I went to download my mail <br>
that said messages were being removed from my inbox.  Never <br>
seen anything like that before. I've contacted my server and <br>
they are investigating this apparent breach of security.<br>
I only hope this message gets out. <br>
<p>
If slander, vicious ad hominem, and death threats don't<br>
work to protect the cover-up of the TWA 800 crash, it <br>
seems the Information Warfare game will move to a new <br>
level: Electronic Warfare. I don't know what to expect <br>
next, a bullet in the head or some kind of electronic <br>
terrorism, or both. At the same time other members of <br>
our research team have been threaten with or are now <br>
being hauled before a federal grand jury that has done <br>
NOTHING but TERRORIZE private TWA 800 researchers. A <br>
full-court, Establishment-wide campaign of slander, <br>
intimidation, and terror. Is this still America??<br>
<p>
Here is one of the headers underwhich one of my rerouted <br>
private email came to me... my comments follow it. I've <br>
cut away 90% of the CC: list:<br>

This is a fraction of the length of the cc: list. Below the long cc: <br>
list was a private message sent to me that never arrived to me from <br>
the sender, but rather from the header above. The first time Richard<br>
Russell was hit by the FBI, they shut him off the Internet, from both<br>
of his two server accounts. This would be the second time electronic<br>
jamming-type activity has coincided directly with FBI aggression<br>
on our small group of private TWA 800 researchers. But surely<br>
it would be "paranoid" to see any connections. <br>
<p>
Vicious slander... death threats... electronic terrorism...<br>
<p>
your tax dollars at work<br>
<p>
wake up people<br>
