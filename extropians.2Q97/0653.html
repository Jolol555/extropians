<i>&gt;Thank You, but I must admit I was surprised</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the  lists  general indifference to my plight.</i><br>
<p>
Why should I feel particularly interested in your plight? I don't mean this<br>
as a flame, but really why should I? You are a complete stranger to me. You<br>
are not a close friend. Lots of people die everyday. You say in your first<br>
message that you smoked 2 packs a day for forty years. Then you got a heart<br>
attack. Wow! Its hardly surprising. Perhaps the only surprise to me is that<br>
it was a heart attack and not cancer. As someone else has said you have a<br>
serious medical condition and you should be getting serious medical advice,<br>
not getting irritated that complete strangers, who are not medical experts,<br>
for not sending you lots of pseudo-medical advice. I'm sure if you are not<br>
careful you'll get lots of 'helpful' advice from all sorts of people<br>
online.<br>
<p>
If you want any advice it would be to take into account that lifestyle<br>
factors are the leading cause of death in our society and diet is<br>
undoubtedly a major factor in many people's unhealth. I have a vegan diet<br>
which is a straighforward way of increasing the amount carbohydrates in<br>
your diet and cutting down the amount of fat. And even being doesn't mean<br>
that you'll eat well you have to be careful to ensure that you get adequate<br>
nutrition (and I still eat more fat than I would like). If in addition to<br>
following a good diet you get regular exercise you'll have made a major<br>
step towards better health. No doubt there are many other things you could<br>
do - like going on a calorie restricted diet - but simply moving towards a<br>
healthy diet, not smoking and getting regular exercise you will have moved<br>
much more than most people in the West towards significantly longer life<br>
expectancy. Obviously given your heart problem you should be very careful<br>
with the amount of exercise do, but I am sure your doctor can advise you<br>
properly.<br>
<p>
best wishes,  patrick<br>
