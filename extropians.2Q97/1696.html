(I originally posted this to the LA-Agora list unto which so many of us<br>
have been assimilated, but I think its relevant here as well)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;What we need now is libertarian philosophy adequate for life in the 21st</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;century,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We've got one.  The general concept is "Government doesn't work".  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; specifics are fairly obvious once you start there.</i><br>
<p>
The current evidence seems to support the notion that economic<br>
interference by the state is bad economics, but will this always be the<br>
case?  It is not inconcievable that advances in complex adaptive systems<br>
theory, or some other discipline, may lead to the discovery of "lever points"<br>
within economies that would allow articulate control of economic<br>
rescources without the fear of collapse.  Economists and scientists (evil<br>
ones, no doubt) could provide policy makers with indefinately sustainable<br>
socialist economic policies.<br>
<p>
The possibilty that socialists could finally make their economics work is<br>
not happy news. Even *if* future scientific advances make socialism a<br>
viable system, it will still be slavery.  Only then it would be far more<br>
difficult to overcome than now when "Government doesn't work" is a good<br>
estimation.  Take home message: Stop statism before it developes into<br>
something more efficiant.<br>
<p>
Exovivo! <br>
