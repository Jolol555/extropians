I apologize for my lack of skill at debate, for the reason that the two<br>
points I was trying to make got lost somehow, and I was mistaken as saying<br>
that low focus, noncritical thought is *better* or more *beautiful* than<br>
critical, scientific high focus thought. not what I meant at all..<br>
so here goes again:<br>
1).<br>
I merely seek to point out that *both* have their own role to play in the<br>
creative act, IN FACT, neither one is separate from the other - it is more of<br>
a sliding scale, with logic and critical/rational linear thought on one end,<br>
and dreaming/emotional/imagination based thought on the other...<br>
The mind can exist in both, to one degree or another...and neither one should<br>
be revered as superior, or should end up eliminated.. <br>
This does NOT mean that I ignore the beneficial evolutionary trend towards<br>
higher focus, logical thought, nor  devalue it's role in the development of<br>
our present technological fortitude.<br>
<p>
And it is numb.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, IMO, some individuals are more comfortable staying on high<br>
focus, less imaginative thoughts, just as some are only comfortable in low<br>
focus, intuitive and emotional thinking...<br>
IMO, the more advanced we become we will be able to slide up and down the<br>
scale with ease,  imaginative/emotional and critical/logical - depending on<br>
 what is most useful to our task. This does not negate the beauty and grace<br>
of either state.<br>
As I said, the type of thought useful for songwriting, creating worlds and<br>
images may not work in a practical situation... but then the same is true for<br>
the reverse!<br>
<p>
I found it interesting that was perceived as insulting to logic! However I am<br>
at fault, for I was not clear. <br>
<p>
2).<br>
I was asserting that on the list, an unintentional denigration of those<br>
traits ( (emotional, intuitive, imaginative, artsy touchy feely thoughts) had<br>
the implication that a person who does enjoy a good MUSE- imaginative,<br>
emotional, visual, poetic, romantic, dreamy... is doing something<br>
nonextropic....<br>
<p>
Maybe I am correct, and my musings are not valued.. since I am not a<br>
scientist, only a to science.... but my experience with Extropy is that<br>
regular doses of low focus, belly laughing, fun, music neophyte, pleasure,<br>
laughter, dreams and flights of fancy are imperative to a good full<br>
experience, along with -nanotechnology, cryonics  and the delights of arguing<br>
whether A =A<br>
<p>
With Love,<br>
