<i>&gt; From: James Rogers &lt;jamesr@best.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;1) The markets are not perfectly efficient -- perfect efficiency</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   requires perfect information transfer. The fact that markets are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   ever shifting, products ever changing, information always taking</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   time to diffuse, means they can never be perfectly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   efficient. However, the markets are pretty damn close to efficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   these days -- efficient enough that things like day trading are a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   risky way to make a living.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The markets are far from perfect.  There are many wildly over-valued</i><br>
<i>&gt; companies (some over-valued for reasons I can't possibly fathom) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; many undervalued companies as well.  Also, the values of all</i><br>
<i>&gt; securities are based on the expected *future* value and earnings,</i><br>
<i>&gt; not the current book value.</i><br>
<p>
You may believe, based on "gut" that the markets aren't efficient, but<br>
the statistics don't bear this out. In particular, attempts at<br>
objective metrics like those used in so-called "Value Investing" turn<br>
out not to work very well.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;2) It is possible to exploit market inefficiencies to make money. I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   seen people who are just too far out of the statistical spectrum to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   be accidents -- traders like Paul Tudor Jones and Louis</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   Bacon. These people are, however, unusual. I've seen far, far more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   people who can't manage to trade their way out of a paper</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   bag.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The keys to making money on the market are sufficient education on how the</i><br>
<i>&gt; market really works, and doing enough research to make informed decisions.</i><br>
<p>
Of course, the question of what "sufficient education" means is rather<br>
hard to quantify. I've seen many smart people fail miserably in the<br>
markets, or decieve themselves into thinking they were outperforming<br>
the market higher than statistical chaance would permit.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;3) The people who are guaranteed a place at the banquet are the casino</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   owners. Brokers always get their vig. Traders -- especially</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   amateurs -- don't always do so well. In the futures market, friends</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   of mine at Refco tell me the average time between opening a futures</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   trading account and losing *ALL* your stake is about a year.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Futures are a very dangerous market to trade; futures are even dangerous to</i><br>
<i>&gt; seasoned experts.  Futures is one of the few markets I will not trade in.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Amateurs trading futures are foolhardy.</i><br>
<p>
Futures aren't in fact more dangerous than other markets. The reason<br>
they are perceived as dangerous is because they permit so much<br>
leverage. However, there is no real difference between buying an S&amp;P<br>
500 future and buying the S&amp;P 500 as a basket, or between buying wheat<br>
futures and buying wheat. The temptation, however, is to use the<br>
leverage to acquire a position that is too large for you.<br>
<p>
BTW, some of the richest men I know became rich in futures trading. On<br>
the other hand, they have lots of expertise and intelligence, and they<br>
are a rare breed. I'd never try it and I don't recommend it.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;4) The people who do manage to make money "trading" rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   "investing" are almost inevitably full time professionals who are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   very, very smart -- and even they sometimes "blow up". The author</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   of the famous "Memoirs of a Stock Operator", Larry Livingston,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   killed himself a few years after writing his book after losing</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   every penny he had.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There are many successful part-time traders.  At every brokerage there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; one or two clients who average 100% return every year, a small group of</i><br>
<i>&gt; clients who average 50% every year, and a very large number who average 10%</i><br>
<i>&gt; a year.</i><br>
<p>
You do realize, though, that just random chance would lead to this<br>
distribution, correct?<br>
<p>
What you are advocating is "active investing", the notion that you can<br>
do much better than the market by just putting a fairly modest amount<br>
of time in. I don't really believe that strongly any more. It is<br>
demonstrably possible that you can do better than the market -- but it<br>
isn't easy. Remember, if it was, everyone would do it. The markets<br>
*are* fairly efficient.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;On the other hand....</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;1) Over the long term, the stock market DOES outperform almost all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   other investments -- and outperforms it handsomely.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;2) You don't even have to think much to make money in the markets:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   passive investments like buying into an S&amp;P 500 following mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   fund do bring their investors excellent returns.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Safe and profitable, but not aggressively profitable.  It will take decades</i><br>
<i>&gt; to grow a sizeable sum, especially if you are starting small.</i><br>
<p>
Well, "slow and steady wins the race". Better to get a nice steady 15%<br>
a year than zero.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;3) Even random portfolios of sufficient size do pretty well in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   general.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Random portfolios are stupid.  You might as well invest in a mutual fund,</i><br>
<i>&gt; which is probably safer.</i><br>
<p>
I see you haven't been following the research.<br>
<p>
In fact, a large random portfolio isn't especially stupid. It tracks<br>
the market average well. Most people can't afford sufficient<br>
diversification to get a large random portfolio -- you need a lot of<br>
different stocks to make one track the market properly -- and you are<br>
likely to do as well far more easily with an index fund, but there is<br>
little reason to refer to a large random portfolio as "stupid", and<br>
there is little reason to believe an active mutual fund to be "safer".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;4) People who have a slight information edge -- like understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   what a high tech company does -- can sometimes get an advantage</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;   even if they aren't full time investors.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Absolutely.</i><br>
<p>
Note my caution. "Sometimes".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I have a third option:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Taking the time to do adequate research and to make informed decisions pays</i><br>
<i>&gt; off handsomely.  I probably spend 20 hours per month doing research and</i><br>
<i>&gt; educating myself on the market.  As a result, I have done very well over</i><br>
<i>&gt; the years, and far better than the indices.  I am usually holding 6 to 8</i><br>
<i>&gt; stock positions at any one time and have not had a negative month that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; can remember.  To date this year I have averaged ~8% return every month.</i><br>
<p>
This is the question: is your performance truly out of line with the<br>
markets? Absolute returns aren't very interesting -- returns relative<br>
to market, and the statistical likelyhood of getting there by<br>
accident, are far more interesting.<br>
<p>
Also, remember -- higher return often is a sign of higher risk.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Some years are better than others, but I consistently do far better</i><br>
<i>&gt; than the market by making intelligent trades and not reacting to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fluctuations and fickleness of the market (especially the NASDAQ!).</i><br>
<i>&gt; I rarely hold a stock position more than a year and often no more</i><br>
<i>&gt; than 6 months.</i><br>
<p>
I'll point out that the second richest man in the U.S., Warren<br>
Buffett, often holds positions for years or decades.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; For those with only small amounts of money to invest (say $50 per month), I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would recommend investing in growth oriented mutual funds.  The brokerage</i><br>
<i>&gt; houses penalize small trades heavily.  Trading stocks starts to become</i><br>
<i>&gt; economical when you have enough money saved to start buying at least 40-50</i><br>
<i>&gt; shares per trade.</i><br>
<p>
40 or 50 shares is still too small -- you pay extra commission for odd<br>
lots, and round lots are always multiples of 100 shares except for<br>
oddball stocks like Berkshire Hathaway which trades at $30,000 a share.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; There is some risk involved, but there is no need to put such a grim spin</i><br>
<i>&gt; on trading.  There are many people who make consistent profits as</i><br>
<i>&gt; part-time, amateur traders.</i><br>
<p>
True enough, but it isn't trivial. *That* you save and invest steadily<br>
is far more important than *if*.<br>
<p>
I don't want to sound like a naysayer -- there is nothing wrong with<br>
picking your own stocks. However, it isn't the way most people are<br>
going to become rich, and it is *real work*. If you are better at some<br>
other profession, investment is not the road to getting rich<br>
quick. Indeed -- there ARE no roads to getting rich "quick" that work<br>
reliably.<br>
