Perhaps a way to end this is for those who agree with 'required community <br>
service' give an example of what is required and see how many respond <br>
opposing this.  I remit, total agreement is fine (but is frightful as <br>
everyone agreeing on anything is), forcing agreement (as in the US getting <br>
$16/day for required jury duty...notwithstanding it is a one day jury for <br>
drunk driving cases to 1 year on a murder case...or longer) not only seems <br>
dictatorial but seems to violate the very declaration of extropianism.<br>
<p>
Forcing agreement forbids dissent.  Will this turn into 'Fine, don't do the <br>
required service even if you disagree, no problem.  Just don't expect to be <br>
able to work, bank, or get unemployment' as with the 'voluntary' US tax <br>
laws.<br>
<p>
Tell us when reason isn't right.  (A scary thought when reason is <br>
wrong...what is left....emotion?).<br>

Suggestion: why not explain this clearly and logically in a way (say) a<br>
ten-year old could understand, and then let your opponent put forth his<br>
model in the same simple way. Then we can start analyzing what reason<br>
tells us (but don't forget history; reason isn't always right).<br>
