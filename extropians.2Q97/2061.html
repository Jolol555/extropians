Because if the family shot him for no reason then they would be tried for<br>
murder as well. If they shot him in self-defence when he tries to kill<br>
them (thereby proving he *is* a persistent danger) then they'll have no<br>
case to answer. <br>

<p>
Who's to say they're a significant danger, and what danger is he to the<br>
family if they've sold their claim to a collection ageny? He has no<br>
further reason to kill them, and will merely increase his debts by doing<br>
so. He might just be a maniac, but if he is and preys on anyone other than<br>
outlaws he'll probably already be dead. <br>

<i>&gt; "Claim" or no, I still value my life more than my money...I think most</i><br>

<p>
What he's advocating is something very similar to the situation in Iceland<br>
a few hundred years ago, and what seems to happen in some Middle Eastern<br>
countries today; if you kill someone you pay compensation to their<br>
relatives. In the Icelandic case the claim is transferrable, so that if<br>
you can't collect the fine yourself you can sell the claim to a more<br>
powerful individual or organization who can. Hence there's no benefit to <br>
killing the owner of the claim because it will simply be transferred to <br>
*their* relatives or beneficiaries when they die.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; What I want to emphasize is that execution and</i><br>
<i>&gt; incarceration are sometimes necessary...though most certainly not</i><br>
<i>&gt; state-sanctioned. </i><br>
<p>
Well, I've already said in another post that I can see reasons for<br>
executing some people, but having re-read Friedman's comments I think<br>
he may be correct about fines being better, except in extreme cases. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; If someone decides to take other people's lives away, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; should he be able to walk away freely?  If he caused a family pain, grief,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and a lifetime of longing for their lost relative, should there not be an</i><br>
<i>&gt; effect. </i><br>
<p>
Uh, he's not walking away freely; he's walking away with tens or hundreds<br>
of thousands of dollars in fines (possibly millions if he's rich). He<br>
either makes arrangements to pay up or no legal system will accept him and<br>
he becomes an outlaw; he's then prey for any real maniacs out there or the<br>
collection agency can kidnap him and sell him as a slave or something. <br>
Whatever happens he's not going to go on to lead a good and happy life. <br>
