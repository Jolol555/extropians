You didn't disappoint us :)<br>

Were I in such a fortunate position, I would not accept the first offer.<br>
Even presuming that ATT makes their best offer first ( which from a game<br>
theory perspective is probably unlikely ), some other big company might<br>
beat it. So it would be to my advantage to go public and solicit offers.<br>
<p>
Also, why are we being so generous selling a device for $80 that saves<br>
the buyer $300 per year?  Does it only last for three months?  It seems<br>
if it has a mean lifespan of several years minimum like most appliances,<br>
the minimum selling price should be upwards of $500.<br>
<p>
I suspect that it hasn't happened.<br>
