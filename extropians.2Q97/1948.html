I used to think a lot about death penalty for murderers as a kid. I then<br>
thought that execution was nonviable, since making executor symmetrical to<br>
its victim. The appropriate solution seemed back then to isolate the<br>
offender irreversibly (in a kid's imagination: whisk away to alternative<br>
universe, planet, etc.) to prevent future damage to the society. <br>
<p>
A friend of mine currently proposes dedicating an (navy-) isolated island<br>
to the terminal criminals, destroying their vessels should they wish to<br>
depart. This takes care of isolation, but is basically sending prisoners<br>
to an ersatz hell during their life time. Since every law enforcement has<br>
a noticeable error rate, this seems inacceptable. <br>
<p>
I see a big problem with death penalties in the US: costs for the death<br>
row prisoner integrated over the entire time are easily sufficient to<br>
maintain him during a life sentence. Unless implementation of death <br>
sentences is low-overhead, the cost argument is inapplicable.<br>
<p>
To reduce costs, I think one might use modern technology for solitary<br>
prisoner containment (with adequate hygiene, food, and media access),<br>
wether automated cells (I don't think anybody can escape from a solid<br>
metal cell with external life suport), or home confinement, automatically<br>
guarded by exploding implants or collars.<br>
<p>
Whether above captive maintance expenses are acceptable to the society... <br>
I dunno. An individual will pay private security to get rid of the <br>
offender. By whatever means, provided they are cheap.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You get to vote on the matter, try the case, or execute the person, if --</i><br>
<i>&gt; -- and only if -- you agree to  this procedure.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the man is convicted and sentenced, you must spend a month getting to</i><br>
<i>&gt; know the accused, and get to know them, their friends, family and</i><br>
<i>&gt; colleagues. Their unique and irreplaceable selves.</i><br>
<p>
Why? Somebody has commited an atrocity. If the victims security system is<br>
inadequate, we're forced to believe the evidence gathered by others. If<br>
the evidence is very weighty, that person is probably guilty, and ought to<br>
be permanently isolated from the society. If the code of that particular<br>
society demands execution, and I have been selected randomly for its<br>
implementation (But why?  That should be the job for professional<br>
security?). If I'd be reimbursed for that month of learning the details of<br>
the case (But why? The jury has already investiated the case) I'd do. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; You must then try to learn what really happened, and why.</i><br>
<p>
That obviously depends on the amount of data, and who has gathered the data.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; At the completion of the month, you _have_ to execute the accused _even if</i><br>
<i>&gt; you believe they're innocent, and you'll destroy the hasppiness of others,</i><br>
<p>
Then what is the point of that month? If I can't bow out: 1) this code of<br>
this particular society is inacceptable, so one either tries to change the<br>
code, or to depart the society. 2) On above terms: if I live in this<br>
particular society and I get reimbursement for the one month, and a<br>
possibility to bow out should this case appear fishy, I'd be willing to<br>
play the executor. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; perhaps deprive the world of irreplaceable talents, and be executed</i><br>
<i>&gt; yourself into the bargain.</i><br>
<p>
Why for? I'd thougt the randomly selected executor's personality would be<br>
held anonymously to protect him from possible violence from relatives? <br>
What's the point to exposing the executor to attacks from the relatives, <br>
risking modern equivalent of Scottish highland clan wars? I thought <br>
current laws were meant as a point of reference (I know get tat if I do <br>
tit), and to prevent violence runaways, these being detrimental to the <br>
whole society I am a part of?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would _you_ accept these terms?  If not, why not?</i><br>
<p>
I would accept the terms I mentioned above. Not _your_ terms. However, <br>
I'd rather subscribe to a society with a different code (life long <br>
imprisonment rather than execution). Talking about execution in an <br>
immortal society does appear a constructed case. There might be strife and <br>
conflict even after the Singularity, or there might be none: currently, <br>
this is idle musings.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Would you ask _anyone else_ to?  Seriously?  How do you think they would</i><br>
<i>&gt; reply to you?</i><br>
