<p>
I addition to the variables of tired/not and smart/dumb, my model<br>
includes how much one cares about being accepted.  Most smart people<br>
are ambitious, and won't generate or express ideas that would get them<br>
in trouble in the circles they care about.  Some people don't care as<br>
much about this, and so are willing to express wilder ideas.<br>
<p>
In areas where ideas are likely to be accepted, I tend to look to<br>
established authorities for the best ideas.  But in areas where<br>
creative ideas are likely to get people into trouble, I look more<br>
toward the fringe, where the smart outcasts are mixed in with the<br>
clueless.<br>
