<i>&gt; the other transactional costs are borne entirely by the decedent's</i><br>

Dear Geoff, Hagbard, Max and other fellow Extropians:<br>
<p>
The estate tax -- as well as all other taxes -- including the, albeit,<br>
badly flawed, "progressive" income tax -- were initially conceived about<br>
the time of the First World War, as a method of providing additional<br>
revenue for increased governmental expenses and operations.<br>
<p>
An additional and supplimental motivation was the somewhat Keynsian<br>
theory of promoting social change through the re-distribution of the<br>
wealth of an established oligarchy and the creation of greater<br>
socio-economic equality.<br>
<p>
As with many, or possibly most, legislative actions the influence of a<br>
controling oligarchy created (primarily through campaign contributions;<br>
See: Bribes) numerous exemptions to the legislation in order to allow<br>
the oligarchy to maintain and transfer their assets to their heirs while<br>
avoiding taxes. <br>
<p>
In a limited democracy, such as the one presently we live in -- but do<br>
not really control to any great extent -- the rule by economic proxy of<br>
an ever changing, but usually self-serving oligarchy, remains a major<br>
determining influence.<br>
<p>
Obviously, if an estate tax were to be equitable, it would not include<br>
the exemptions that currently exist, and the revenue generated would be<br>
set aside in a specific account for socio-economic equalization.<br>
<p>
The probabilities of this happening under the present campaign financing<br>
scheme are currently slim to none. I suspect however, that they can, and<br>
probably, eventually will be overcome to some extent through a somewhat<br>
Toflerian "Power Shift".<br>
<p>
If, in our paradigms, we merge a philosophy of fantasy with one of<br>
reality, and consider the short, as well as the long term, possible<br>
influence of a broad based and somewhat eglectic but still Extropian<br>
philosophy on evolving cultures and society, it might be possible to<br>
slowly alter and expand the extent of the conciousness of humankind.<br>
<p>
The effort involved would, obviously, be substantial. <br>
<p>
Can we afford, however, to ignore the current state of our developing<br>
society and simply try to ignore our social, moral and ethical<br>
responsabilities to present and future generations by closing our minds<br>
to the realities of our times and engage in escapism by fully focusing<br>
on our attentions and dreams of a distant but better future?<br>
