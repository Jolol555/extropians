cyberedward@ICDC.COM:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Could someone comment on the above and give the scientific viewpoint on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; God, a metaphysical soul etc.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Anders Sandberg:<br>
<i>&gt; Actually, this is simple: from a strictly scientific viewpoint God is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; unsupported hypothesis which does not appear to be falsifiable or</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible to test in any way. There are of course some scientists</i><br>
<i>&gt; who think the God hypothesis is true.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Actually, it's not *that* simple.  In my experience god(s) is not<br>
a single hypothesis, it's more like a spectrum of hypotheses ranging<br>
from an omnipotent and everpresent something (easily verifiable, I<br>
just tried talking with It and It didn't respond---false!) all the<br>
way to a benevolent creator who doesn't talk with its subjects<br>
because they have become wicked (these are mostly unfalsifiable and,<br>
well, useless).  All these hypotheses, if believed in properly, tend<br>
to be excellent placebo cures for a wide range of ailments.<br>
<p>
Speaking of placebo: I bought a pair of wrist bands that are supposed<br>
to cure motion sickness by applying pressure to certain points on the<br>
arms, and amazingly enough they work for me!  Who needs God when we<br>
have the Allmighty Placebo.  Too bad It can't cure cancer.  (Hmm,<br>
perhaps it can but it's an undocumented function...  ;)<br>
<p>
