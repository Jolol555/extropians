&lt;I enjoyed DA (I'll try to use E-prime; books "are" not good or bad, <br>
people like them or not), but it has some flaws (like the hurried <br>
ending). It is actually an unusually detailled description of a <br>
nanotechnological society, with plenty of ideas of new forms of human <br>
organisation.&gt;<br>

I suspect _Diamond Age_ suffered from some heavy and hurried editing. <br>
IOW, there was alot more that Stephenson originally wanted to put in <br>
the book but had to leave out to keep it from becoming too long and <br>
confusing.  E.g., there was a whole excerpt, called "Hack the Spew" on <br>
the cover of Wired about a year before the book came out, that I kept <br>
looking for in the book but it wasn't there.<br>
