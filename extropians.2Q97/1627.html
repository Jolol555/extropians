Gee, that's in the ball park but...<br>
Leaving aside the question of personifying genes, which in truth don't<br>
give a damn about anything, I do think you are coloring them a bit<br>
harshly.  There is some advantage to the gene in keeping mom and pop<br>
alive, especially as long as they can breed with fidelity, it just <br>
isn't a strong enough advantage to change the genes quickly. Most of <br>
human evolution took place when old age was not a common cause of death <br>
so it really did not help a lot to have a long natural life span.  It's<br>
not so much that genes don't want old folks around as that it's just<br>
not high on their priority list.<br>
<p>
To pursue this question seriously I would suggest Michael Rose's work<br>
selectively breading fruit flies for longevity, Caleb Finch's <br>
_Longevity, Senescence and the Genome_, and a good book on the<br>
mathematics of evolution.  I have spent a little time with each of<br>
these but not enough to really answer Joao's question.<br>
