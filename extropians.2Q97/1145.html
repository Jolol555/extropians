<i>&gt; Here's a counter-argument for you.  If forward-thinking types like us</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't counter the reproductive forces of the moronic masses, at least to</i><br>

<i>&gt; prevail?  Who knows, my kid could be the next Max More!</i><br>
<p>
What I was getting at was the stats that show that poorer and less<br>
educated people tend to have more children than educated affluent<br>
people, which explains why the "explosion" in world population really<br>
only exists in undeveloped or underdeveloped nations. Seeing as how much<br>
health care technology benefits the life expectancy of poor people much<br>
more than rich people, despite increasingly high costs of service,<br>
technology seems to in this respect act as a governor on natural<br>
evolution, providing negative feedback that allows less successful<br>
strains to survive and reproduce, which brings us back to the old social<br>
darwinism thread. Given the decreasing influence of natural selection in<br>
our species due to the benefits of health care technology, one would<br>
argue that our society should evolve to enhance or encourage increased<br>
selectivity in other aspects of our culture. The shift toward more open<br>
free markets is one indication that this is happening. Unfortunately,<br>
while natural selection conveniently killed off unsuccessfull strains,<br>
we have the unsuccessful strains hanging around taking up space,<br>
resources, and bandwidth. This winds up expending the evolutionary<br>
"inertia bank" on a faster and faster basis. Before I start to sound too<br>
ghoulish, I'm not too worried about it, as I know that once space travel<br>
becomes more viable, enough to be able to colonize, we will have a new<br>
big filter. Still and all, my statement was a reflection of my noticing<br>
that of all the people I grew up with, while most of the smart ones are<br>
just starting to settle down and start families, the morons are already<br>
married, divorced, with 2-4 kids. Makes me want to lobby for birth<br>
licenses.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There's the other line of discussion about whether or not one can best</i><br>
<i>&gt; achieve immortality through one's genes or one's memes.  In other words,</i><br>
<i>&gt; how much is one limiting one's advancement and personal development by</i><br>
<i>&gt; settling down into family life?  I struggled with this one too, and have</i><br>
<i>&gt; come to the conclusion that I want to have, and think I can accomodate,</i><br>
<i>&gt; both.  I know that I have developed quite a bit by being married, and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; expect that being a father will offer many new opportunities to grow.  So</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll hopefully end up being a better, more effective person, and will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; bringing a potential new Extropian into the world to boot.</i><br>
<p>
Of course. Until we can upload multiple copies, or clone bunches of<br>
ourselves, we are realistically limited to the one current, proven, and<br>
whole lotta fun method.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Along those lines, does anyone have any suggestions for how to raise a</i><br>
<i>&gt; successful, Extropian child?  Are there any particularly good books, web</i><br>
<i>&gt; sites, etc. out there?</i><br>
