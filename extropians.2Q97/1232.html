     Dan,<br>
     <br>
     Thanks for your feedback.  From an extropian p.o.v, I agree that <br>
     robotics has beneficial ramifications to a broad spectrum of our <br>
     society, provided our current work ethic evolves along with the <br>
     technology.  Ask any blue collar worker whose livelihood has been <br>
     usurped by technology, they'd likely have a different (albeit <br>
     knee-jerk) view.  <br>
     <br>
     I'd need more convincing about your statement "The best way to help <br>
     people is to help yourself."  Sounds kinda like the Republicans in the <br>
     80s with their trickle-down economics.  It's also like the glass is <br>
     half-empty, half-full concept.  It may be a very complex path from the <br>
     results of your efforts to the benefit they perceive (and they may not <br>
     be well-informed enough to even perceive it).  Therefore, the concept <br>
     seems to require an installation of "faith" to power it.  OTOH, you <br>
     can't help/love others until you help/love yourself.  I agree with <br>
     that conceptually.  It's just in our culture, the "pure concept" <br>
     becomes an entangled mess of complex exceptions and exclusions when <br>
     filtered through the bureaucracy, the propriety and materialistic <br>
     mindset.  <br>
     <br>
     Bottom line: you can't help another person who is drowning if you are <br>
     in a vulnerable position of going under yourself.  So I do agree that <br>
     those of us who are capable should get our ducks squarely lined up <br>
     (financially and otherwise).  However, I don't think we need to spend <br>
     extra time wringing out our wet clothes while the needy continue to <br>
     thrash in water over their heads.  They don't KNOW how to swim.  <br>
     Whether it's their fault or they deserve what they get is secondary <br>
     when they are about to perish.<br>
     <br>
     Also, let me just reiterate that financial investment is not an issue <br>
     I disdain.  I'd like to become more adept at understanding the current <br>
     mechanism and I'm appreciating the contributions made along this <br>
     thread.  I am concerned at how quickly we forget where we came from in <br>
     our own financial climb.  Our "standard of living" gets higher, we <br>
     want more "stuff" and there seems to be less connection to the <br>
     community needs and our ability to assist.  <br>
     <br>
     Looking to the future with a more extropian outlook, I'd like to see a <br>
     move beyond the current concept of market economy.  Nanotechnology, if <br>
     its promise of providing everything from manufactured electronics to <br>
     assembled filet mignon, could facilitate a smooth transition from a <br>
     hoarding, survivalist self-oriented mentality to a connected, <br>
     supportive and benevolent one. I think utopia is possible and I refuse <br>
     to believe that humanity isn't capable of transcending instinctual, <br>
     animalstic tendencies to survive at all costs.  <br>
     <br>
     If extropian thinking means pushing the envelope, I'd like to include <br>
     the eventual elimination of the apathy we use as a protection against <br>
     feeling for those who "have not" (those on the economic edge who <br>
     unluckily fall off) or "can not" (mentally ill/emotionally abused).  <br>
     The other group, the "will nots"--that group of non-contributors who <br>
     prefer non-participation--are a tougher group for which to drum up <br>
     genuine compassion.  I don't know how to regard people who expect to <br>
     live in a structured community but not contribute to it.<br>
     <br>
     As I become more aware of the tenets of libertarianism, I'm still not <br>
     sure at how compassion for the disenfranchised sector fits into the <br>
     schema.  From what I can perceive, impassive and continuous giving is <br>
     considered a dysfunctional form of "enabling", only serving to <br>
     perpetuate their lack of usefulness.  I don't want to have tax dollars <br>
     going toward a feeble welfare system, one so over-burdened with <br>
     bureaucracy that people blatantly take full advantage of it and suck <br>
     it dry.  But how can I stand in judgment of that type of person when <br>
     in some capacity, we all take advantage of a system, whether it's <br>
     driving past the agreed upon speed limit, eluding building permit <br>
     rules, excluding items on our tax returns, or using company e-mail to <br>
     spout our personal agendas &lt;G&gt;.  The welfare hackers just seem more <br>
     obvious and, perhaps despicable, because they are lower in the class <br>
     system and provide no ongoing contribution to justify the peccadilloes <br>
     of their higher class fellow citizens.<br>
     <br>
     Perhaps a question to end with is how does extropian <br>
     living/thinking/feeling empower beyond the self?  Is self-empowerment <br>
     the tried-and-true solution to community/national/planetary <br>
     enhancement or is it merely a notion of the noble-minded <br>
     intellegencia?  <br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
     <br>
