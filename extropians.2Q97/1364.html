     "As for health, which of course is a major value to me -- especially <br>
     my own -- I drink Diet Coke sometimes, and don't believe it's harming <br>
     me. Drinking a large quantity might be bad because of the phosphoric <br>
     acid (informed feedback is welcome here), but I don't drink much. "<br>
     <br>
     Response:<br>
     <br>
     Aspartame was discovered in l965 by Searle chemist, Jim<br>
     Schlatter.  He was developing this drug for another use and after<br>
     accidentally licking his finger found that aspartame was sweet.  Today<br>
     aspartame is consumed by more than 100 million people in the United<br>
     States.  This chemical (aspartame) has been approved by the Food and <br>
     Drug Administration (FDA) who said that an individual can safely <br>
     consume 97 packets of aspartame every day.  Aspartame is in many <br>
     products including some that children use such as diet soda, light <br>
     yogurt, Flintstone Vitamins, baked goods, puddings, and Winterfresh <br>
     gum.  It has been known to cause headaches, nausea, vision problems, <br>
     seizures and cancer in its users.  <br>
     <br>
     The ingredients in aspartame are aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and <br>
     methyl alcohol.  Methyl alcohol is a chemical that breaks down in high<br>
     temperatures and turns into formaldehyde and DKP (diketopiperazine), <br>
     two chemicals known to cause problems in the nervous system.  <br>
     Aspartame's life is 262 days at 77 degrees Fahrenheit, or 25 degrees <br>
     Celsius.  The FDA gets more complaints about aspartame than any other <br>
     food or drink.  The symptoms of aspartame are a lot like the symptoms <br>
     of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.  Ever since aspartame <br>
     was approved in l985, there has been an increase in brain tumors.  <br>
     There is no direct proof that aspartame caused the brain tumors, but <br>
     there is enough reason to suspect that, and the television show, "60 <br>
     Minutes" recently did a report linking the increase in brain cancer to <br>
     aspartame use.  <br>
     <br>
     The FDA reviewed Searle's studies of this artificial sweetener in <br>
     which rats were fed aspartame daily with their meals for one year.  <br>
     There were 12 brain tumors in the 320 rats that were fed aspartame and <br>
     no brain tumors in the 120 rats that were not fed aspartame.<br>
     <br>
     There was also a study done at the University of Wisconsin on rhesus<br>
     monkeys.  they were fed aspartame daily.  After  day 200 of a one year<br>
     study the monkeys developed epileptic seizures.  After the study <br>
     ended,the aspartame was discontinued and the monkeys were fully <br>
     watched for 60 days.  The monkeys had no more seizures.<br>
     <br>
     The aspartame contained in diet soda stored over time can break down <br>
     into formaldehyde and DKP, two very dangerous poisons.  Taste tests <br>
     revealed a noticeable difference among tasters.  The higher the heat <br>
     of storage, the<br>
     worse the taste.<br>
     <br>
     Diet soda stored for ten weeks loses flavor.  Aspartame in that soda<br>
     breaks down into two products, formaldehyde and DKP.  The warmer the<br>
     temperature, the greater the loss of aspartame and the greater the<br>
     increase in DKP.<br>
     <br>
     Temperature creates two effects.  First, the higher the temperature of<br>
     storage, the higher the level of DKP in the soda.  Second, room<br>
     temperature seems to create the highest levels of formaldehyde in <br>
     soda. At very high temperatures, the formaldehyde breaks down.  <br>
     However, even stored in a refrigerator at cold temperature, the <br>
     aspartame breaks down into formaldehyde. <br>
     <br>
     After diet soda containing aspartame is purchased it should not be <br>
     stored in the heat or under any condition for a long  period of time.  <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Max continues:<br>
     <br>
     "Sugary Coke shouldn't be bad for someone if they drink it <br>
     *occasionally*. That choice is up to each individual. I do not see it <br>
     as my duty to refrain from investing in Coke because some people<br>
     choose to drink five cans of sugary Coke per day."<br>
     <br>
     Response:<br>
     <br>
     As I indicated in an earlier post, I probably spent half of my life <br>
     mindlessly guzzling and munching on sugar water and partially <br>
     hydrogenated empty calorie "food".  I'm a lot more in moderation now <br>
     that I have a mindful attenuation to my body but I'd no sooner invest <br>
     in Coke, McDonalds or Frito Lay than I would in Phillip Morris, whose <br>
     products were made available to and shorted the lives of millions of <br>
     information-deprived and less educated people both here and abroad.  <br>
     <br>
     Yes, humans make their own decisions as I am profoundly aware with the <br>
     loss of both my parents this year to lung-related illness due to <br>
     smoking.  But some humans are less capable of others of making sound <br>
     decisions and that factor must be considered before one shrugs off <br>
     consequences.  It is no different than one attaining more profound <br>
     awareness wherein they take on Extropian characteristics.  Some may be <br>
     instinctively that way, others must be patiently coached.  <br>
     <br>
     If someone drinks their way to obesity or diabetes, the subtle <br>
     rippling effect of that dis-ease manifests in the community, in the <br>
     culture. Might not the extropian aim be not so much altruistic as <br>
     quintessentially noble?<br>
