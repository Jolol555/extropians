Show me a set of enzymes capable of building a cage just three atoms <br>
across, and I'll believe that. Enzymes can't build nor break down <br>
diamandoids, and the bigger the cages are, the harder it gets.<br>

The only way to design a protein is the darwinian one, either in vitro, or<br>
in machina. The hard part is which sequence is right, after that it is <br>
plain sailing, routine work for a graduate student. As far I can see, <br>
a bioscientist taking up molecular modelling is making a great <br>
contribution to the art of molecular manufacturing. Should machine-phase <br>
chemistry be unattainable, we'd still have protein-based molecular <br>
circuitry, and wet autoreplicators. A very substantial second prize, imo.<br>

P.S. Conc. the original subject: each species as a whole has an optimal<br>
individuum life time, where adaptation rate is at the maximum (no, this is<br>
not a definition). After some primates had experienced a memetic takeover,<br>
a gross disequilibrium in relation to lifetime had occured. Do not forget<br>
that we already get exceptionally old, whether as a primate, or a mammal. <br>
The new thing with us, we might be able to abandon discontinous Darwin for<br>
the continous Lamarck quite soon, with added extras like rational design.<br>
(Darwin is still firmly with us, though. You can't get rid of him.) No<br>
event like that has ever happened on this planet. <br>
