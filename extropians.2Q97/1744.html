Several, but antibiotics aren't necessary for human survival.  If they fail<br>
(which is not yet clear) the death rate goes up a bit and we have to be more<br>
careful about public health measures.  But, overall, we'll do fine.  Epidemic<br>
diseases are anything but new.  Also, there are methods for controlling bugs<br>
other than antibiotics which we kind of tossed aside when antibiotics came<br>
along.  There's a Russian doctor who is claiming great success with phage<br>
therapy now that we can apply modern genetic knowledge and biotechnology.<br>

<p>
Lowering population pressure would have nothing to do with averting<br>
antibiotic resistance, but I digress.<br>
<p>

Indeed, we do need an ecosystem to survive.  But artificial ecosystems, by<br>
which I mean farms and such, do just fine.  They can run the carbon cycles<br>
and the nitrogen cycles just as well as natural ones (better, really, from<br>
our point of view).  Things like the hydrologic cycles and the geologic ones<br>
are done by the weather and plate techtonics.  Most of the real work of the<br>
ecosystems (garbage disposal and cycles for the less common elements) is done<br>
by the germs, and they remain ubiquitous.<br>
