Mike, I think your gesture of rebellion or defiance here is misplaced. <br>
<p>
You are of course free to believe what you like, but whether you like it<br>
or not, your belief bears a certain relation to reality, to the way<br>
fings really is (as opposed to the way you or I think they are); and the<br>
scientific consensus would say that the belief in that kind of car is<br>
just fruitless - it isn't possible, it couldn't be made.  <br>
<p>
Now that's just an opinion too, of course, but if you were to question<br>
it, you would find lots of quite convincing arguments based on demonstrations<br>
you could verify with your own senses, and would have to accept if you<br>
accepted the validity of your senses as giving a good image of reality<br>
most of the time, in normal conditions.<br>
