<p>
First a pet peeve:<br>
1. Apes are not monkeys<br>
2. Monkeys are not apes<br>
<p>
Both are primates as are all members of genus homo along with lemurs,<br>
lorises and tarsiers.<br>
It's a big family tree and we are interested in evolution and the<br>
technology used by at least some primates. Since I took my major in this<br>
a lifetime ago please indulge me.<br>
<p>
Let me throw out a few benchmarks. Homo and Pan (chimpanzees) shared<br>
parents around 14 million years back (immunological  and fossil<br>
evidence). It appears that our branch adopted a more aggressive approach<br>
to technology. As most chimp tech is, by and large limited to sticks<br>
there is no fossil record. We can assume that they were using it 10<br>
million years ago or just for the last century with equal validity. H.<br>
Australopithecus appears associated with "stone axes" or "tools"<br>
(actually a rock broken into 2 or more pieces, according to the patent)<br>
around 3 million years back, give or take. String and rope appear 20,000<br>
BP.  (Just found that checking sources and it oddly corresponds to the<br>
time frame when we first needed to make leashes and collars for Canus<br>
associates). Canus Lupus appears to be the first victim of<br>
domestication, which, as Eric Watt Forste points out is not always a<br>
good thing for the domesticee.<br>
<p>
Social organization of early H. Sapiens seems is closer to baboon troops<br>
than chimps or gorillas but this is probably a parallel evolution<br>
development given that baboons split off 2@10**6 BP.<br>
<p>
Just 2 more points to inject :<br>
The preponderance of  evidence is that H. Sapiens and H. Neanderthalis<br>
are not distinct species making the correct names H. Sapiens Sapiens<br>
(cro-magnon) and H. Sapiens Neanderthalis. Using the biological<br>
definition of species (progeny of members of the set are able to<br>
procreate, contrast donkeys and horses produce offspring, a mule that is<br>
sterile). We are not significantly advanced from Neanderthals<br>
(biologically).<br>
<p>
Domestication does not always result in species. Canus Lupus can and do<br>
breed with C. Familiaris and having owned one such creature (erroneously<br>
referred to as hybrid ), I can assure you they are viable (and very<br>
little like your usual dog). They are, as a matter of fact, costly,<br>
dangerous and unreliable (not unpredictable).<br>
<p>
Monkeys are small, cheap and terrably limited in their abilities, the<br>
great apes (orangutans, gorillas, chimps) are very delicate, expensive<br>
and rare creatures. There is a surplus of available human labor.<br>
"Owning" 90% of a wolf (10% dog) was very demanding emotionally. They<br>
are not ment to be a possesion any more than another human. It really is<br>
morally repugnant.<br>
