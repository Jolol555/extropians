A Warhol original is something touched and manipulated by Mr. A Warhol<br>
himself. He used to sign Cmabell's Soup tins and give them to friends so<br>
they could own a Warhol original. A squiggle on a can of tomato soup was<br>
worth thousands of dollars overnight..... why? .... because the High<br>
Priests of art, the critics of the time, said that anything that Andy<br>
touched was gold dust.<br>
<p>
Warhol was a magician who created a currency and laughed all the way to<br>
the bank<br>
<p>
I would like to ask, 'what is the differnce between this artist sorcerer<br>
and any scientist who has a particular 'theory'?'<br>
<p>
Surely both are playing the currency game and neither represent any<br>
objetive truth.<br>
