I have a very long commute from home to work.  I drive a car to the train<br>
station (5 mins), ride the train to the city (53 mins), take a subway to the<br>
arcology where my job is (15 mins), and walk through the arcology to work<br>
(15 mins).  It's not as bad as it sounds, though, because when I'm on the<br>
train, I  work on my laptop.  In fact, the train is almost a perfect office<br>
for tasks requiring concentration, since it doesn't have distractions like<br>
family, coworkers or the internet on it.  <br>
<p>
It's not clear to me what the advantage of having a wearable computer would<br>
be over the current system.  I don't work on the laptop when I'm on the<br>
subway, because it's too stealable.  Presumably the same whould apply to a<br>
wearable (it might be harder to steal since it would be strapped on, but on<br>
the other hand it would be lighter and more concealable).  And I couldn't<br>
use a wearable while I was walking around, for the same reasons I don't read<br>
books while walking around.  <br>
<p>
The only thing that I really miss when using my laptop is display resolution<br>
and brightness.  But displays that I've seen on existing wearables are much<br>
worse than even the 800x600 LCD screen I'm typing this on.  If I could get a<br>
1280x1024 color display on a wearable, I'd buy it in a minute (well, lobby<br>
my employer to buy it...)<br>
<p>
So what are wearbles for? <br>
