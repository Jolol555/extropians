Very interesting.  Please enlighten me on this process you use to know<br>
things BEFORE proving them.  This could be a very useful process.  At the<br>
very least, it could give us an insight into the minds of the religious.<br>
<p>
Of course, if you have a proof that free markets are bad in both the long<br>
term and the short term I would love to hear it because it would mean that<br>
I could form a better picture of the world.  The same goes for God and the<br>
invisible leprechauns running around my chair.<br>
