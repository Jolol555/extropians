<p>
Much worse?<br>
<p>
Joy.<br>
<p>
About 120 years ago, India and Japan were both profoundly poor<br>
countries with extraordinarily underdeveloped agrarian economies. One<br>
of those countries chose socialism. One chose the free market. Can you<br>
guess which was which?<br>
<p>
About 50 years ago, on the Korean peninsula, a controlled experiment<br>
was done. A uniformly shattered economy was divided in two. Half the<br>
country got a largely capitalist free market economy. Half got a<br>
Maoist local version of communisim called "Juche". Which half is now<br>
starving?<br>
<p>
Around the world, pure idiots think that they know "better" than the<br>
market, that they can redirect resources better than a pareto optimal<br>
free exchange of goods between free people could. Over and over again,<br>
the experiment is done, the people suffer, but the idiots, being pure<br>
in their lack of mentation, never seem to draw the obvious conclusion<br>
the facts lead to -- which is that the freer the economy, the<br>
wealthier the people -- even the poorest 10% of the U.S. population<br>
look rich compared to the average North Korean, the average Albanian<br>
or the average Cuban.<br>
<p>
Mr. Moeller claims to "know that economy and free markets is what<br>
makes those people poor". Well, I'm sure thats what he thinks, but<br>
then again, I know of lots of people who believe in Alien abductions,<br>
pyramid power, psychic surgery and telekinesis. What he "knows" just<br>
isn't so, and hasn't even the slightest crumb of evidence holding it<br>
up.<br>
<p>
What disturbs me more, though, is that anyone would post anything like<br>
that to the Extropians mailing list. Why would anyone *want* to be on<br>
this discussion list if they thought that human freedom wasn't one of<br>
their highest ideals?<br>
