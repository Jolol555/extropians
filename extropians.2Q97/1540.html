I seem to loose more and more imagination with each passing year.  Either <br>
that or I have less and less time to just sit and think.  My reading time <br>
decreases as my work time increases.<br>
<p>
I did have one silly little 'hope'.  I don't even know if it was an <br>
original thought or something I'd read over and archived so deeply in my <br>
brain I don't recall seeing it before.  Total recycling.  Taking a <br>
substance and breaking it down into it's molecular components (carbon, <br>
oxygen, silicon, sulfur, iron, etc).  Nanotech may become a vital <br>
constituent of this process.<br>
<p>
I am not the personality to become a fanatic about any particular idea (so <br>
far) and have more fun reaping the fruits of others labors in areas I <br>
mainly consider entertainment (and of course the ego boost at watching an <br>
MTV add on the Sci-Fi channel with a doubter...'the I told you so' thing). <br>
 I do often wish I had the finances to try an idea.  You gotta spend money <br>
to make money.<br>
<p>
I would like to hear if total recycling has been theorized and how possible <br>
(given that the technology does not now exist) it may be.<br>

Those are very interesting ideas, which turned out to work well.  Of <br>
course<br>
as Edison said 99% of success is perspiration.  Maybe you need to work up<br>
more of a sweat.<br>
<p>
Do you have any predictions of the new ideas we will see succeed in the<br>
next decade?<br>
