<i>&gt; You are speaking from theory.  In reality, I don't think anyone has yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; shown that a society without compulsion can compete with other societies</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the real world.  I am aware that there are some good ideas floating</i><br>
<i>&gt; around about how to provide for common defense without military</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscription, create an educated electorate and a healthy</i><br>
<i>&gt; information-service-based economy without compulsory schooling, provide a</i><br>
<i>&gt; stable money supply without a government monopoly on coinage, etc. But</i><br>
<i>&gt; until they have been proven to work, it's silly to get indignant about it.</i><br>
<p>
First you might prove to me that your idea of society works.  What's<br>
your chosen example, the US?  Where hundreds of thousands of innocent<br>
men and women are jailed every year, whole cities are impoverished by<br>
inflation of fiat currency and barriers to business entry, twice as much<br>
money is stolen from working families as is necessary for education, and<br>
yet fails miserably to educate them, tens of thousands are killed by<br>
overregulation of medicine, thousands have been sent to kill and die on<br>
foreign soil for political reasons, thousands more have died in secret<br>
medical experiments and state-sactioned murders?  Is their blood just a<br>
theory to you?  <br>
<p>
If it seems silly to you to be indignant about such things, I suggest<br>
that you are simply lucky enough never to have felt the shackles on<br>
your own hands or to have buried good friends.  Utopia might not be<br>
possible, but since I can't run simulations of whole societies to find<br>
out, I must rely on principle and reason.  Reason tells me that a free<br>
society would work, and would be less likely to commit the atrocities<br>
that every govenment in human history has committed.  It would be<br>
inhuman not to work toward that goal.<br>
