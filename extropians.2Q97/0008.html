<i>&gt; such a way as to preserve their business relations (based in part on</i><br>
<i>&gt; geographic proximity).  Also, individuals would lose houses and</i><br>
<i>&gt; personal possessions, communities would lose roads, shopping centers,</i><br>

WHile running away per se is not my own cup of tea, the first mandate of<br>
maintaining a viable insurgency (i.e. successful guerrilla camapaign,<br>
not necessarily being centrally controlled) is establishing sources and<br>
routes of supply and relief outside the zone of conflict. In any such<br>
conflict, while con-combatants in the current sense are much like serfs<br>
tied to the land in the feudal sense, in a high tech battle, anyone with<br>
a brain is a combatant. The rules of war dictate eliminating the enemy's<br>
ability to sustain combat, and barring that, denying victory in denying<br>
the victor the spoils. I.E: If you can't win, make sure the other guy<br>
pays dearly for the victory.<br>
<p>
WHile the prospect of losing house and home is not fun, a sorched earth<br>
strategy allows for at least denying the invader the profit of use of<br>
the assets you lose. Boobytrapping anything and everything are mandated.<br>
