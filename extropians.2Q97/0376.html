Yes, it might be something similar, although I have the impression the<br>
clear light (the azoth of the alchemists) is an indivisible experience ("I<br>
am that I am"), not the complex hallucinations (or whatever) of NDE and<br>
OOBE. I would like to point out the similarities with this and temporal <br>
lobe epilepsy (Dostoyevskian epilepsy), and Persinger's experiments:<br>
<p>
"There is little doubt that the class of experiences that comprise<br>
mystical experiences in general, and NDE's in particular, is strongly<br>
correlated with temporal lobe activity....Kate Makarec and I have found<br>
that all of the major components of the NDE [near death experience],<br>
including out-of-body experiences, floating, being pulled towards a light,<br>
hearing strange music, and profound meaningful experiences can occur in<br>
experimental settings during minimal electrical current induction to the<br>
temporal region due to exogenous spike-and-wave magnetic field sources." <br>
       - Michael Persinger in Report on Communion by Ed Conroy <br>
<p>
My personal guess is that the 'clear light' is some kind of limbic state, <br>
started by influencing the temporal lobe. Might be interesting to try. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Is the clear light experience perhaps just experiencing noise *as* noise,</i><br>
<i>&gt; rather than giving in to the habit of trying to find a signal?</i><br>
<p>
I have the impression it is more like seeing "everything as one". One <br>
should distinguish between experiencing noise and having noise in the <br>
brain. <br>
