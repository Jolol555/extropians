<p>
The minumum distance is around 136 kilometers [not a typo!].  Allow me to<br>
quote from a not-yet-complete essay I have cluttering my hard disk:<br>
<p>
&lt;p&gt;The surface of the Sun is hotter than the boiling point of any known <br>
material.  Indeed, it is hot enough to rip any known molecule into atoms.  <br>
One might think this would preclude the direct exploration and <br>
exploitation of the Sun.  However, this is not the case.  It <br>
is possible to build a device that can operate for long periods of time in <br>
the atmosphere of the Sun.  This can be done with plausible near-term <br>
technology, operating with known materials and entirely within the <br>
well-established laws of physics.  <br>
<p>
&lt;p&gt;I call my design for such a device a &lt;i&gt;heliopter&lt;/i&gt; (from the Greek <br>
&lt;i&gt;helios&lt;/i&gt;, Sun, and &lt;i&gt;pter&lt;/i&gt;, wing).  It is essentialy a helicopter <br>
that can hover indefinitely in the Solar atmosphere, using solar energy as <br>
a power source.  <br>
<p>
&lt;p&gt;First I will discuss the environment of the solar atmosphere.  This is <br>
well-established science.  Then I will discuss how one might keep an <br>
object immersed in that atmosphere cold enough to remain solid.  This is <br>
an application of well-established engineering thermodynamics.  Finally, I <br>
will describe the heliopter as a whole.  This is an excercise in wild-ass <br>
system engineering.  There's nothing in the design that I know to be <br>
infeasible, but I certainly haven't worked out every stress and heat flux <br>
and confirmed that it will work.<br>
<p>
[end excerpt]<br>
<p>
You'll get to see the rest of this essay once I calculate some more, and<br>
maybe draw a picture or two.  Provided I don't decide to first finish my<br>
essays on re-engineering the human body or burning down the Sun...<br>

<i>&gt; o Outgoing radiation doesn't have to have a blackbody spectrum.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Lasing comes to mind, or one could heat up relatively small</i><br>
<i>&gt;   radiators to a very high temperature.</i><br>
<p>
Blackbody radiation over the largest possible area is the most efficient way<br>
of getting rid of heat.  All other methods of heat disposal will leave less<br>
energy available for useful purposes.  <br>
<p>
Lasing in particular is very bad.  You wouldn't know it to look at one, but<br>
laser beams are very cold, i.e. have very low entropy.  Thermodynamically<br>
speaking, they're like a perfect crystal at very low temperature, and the<br>
process of producing one requires extracting lots of entropy from a lasing<br>
medium and dumping it in the environment.  Trying to cool something by<br>
emitting a laser beam is like trying to cool your house by installing a<br>
powerful freezer, making lots of ice cubes, and throwing them out the<br>
window.  (Hmmm... that has a certain surreal delight to it.  Imagine a house<br>
with ice cubes flying out all the windows...)<br>

That's OK, I love giving answers.<br>
