Hmm, how about an 'insurance' company set up that takes in payments on a <br>
timed basis (say, quarterly).  This money is used for research with enough <br>
investment to provide payments.  The members designees are given a payment <br>
if a life extension mechanism is not developed prior to the members death <br>
AND the member does not die of a cause (such as traumatic accident) that <br>
the life extension mechanism could help. I imagine the legal woes are <br>
awesome as the current insurance companies would surely do this if it was <br>
feasible (they want you to pay in as long as possible).  I also suppose <br>
there would have to be some age limit put in.<br>
<p>
I wonder what would be the minimum to allow such a thing.  $25/quarter <br>
would allow $100 million/year if a million folk bought into it ($10 <br>
million/year if only 100,000 members).  For a 35/15/50 split of <br>
investment/administration/research would this make a fair start?  Is <br>
$100/year too much to ask?  What would be a reasonable sum?  What would be <br>
a valid payment upon natural death?  When the life extension became a <br>
reality what would the contributors get ... equal shares/amount invested in <br>
all profits ... or only contributors get the benefits?  Also, who/how would <br>
the research be corrobarated, as well as the investments?<br>
<p>
10 years with 1 million inital and faithful members would be $500 million <br>
purely for research.  What is the minimum amount needed for research?<br>

I was just looking at life insurance and a thought came to me.  Would it <br>
be<br>
in the best interests of life insurance companies to pledge support of <br>
life<br>
extension?  There are numerous variables to take into account like how <br>
many<br>
people die in accidents and such things that are not related to aging.  As<br>
I am not an actuary I would not want to attempt taking all of these <br>
factors<br>
into account.  If anyone has any less data intensive ideas that might shed<br>
some light on this possibility I would love to hear them.<br>
