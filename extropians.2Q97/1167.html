<p>
I know, I never said it would be easy. In fact, it is probably one of<br>
the hardest things to do, especially when one is tired. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I find that these why-chains always end up at one of the following ultimate</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Money."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Evolution."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "It's a law of physics."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Chance."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Nobody knows."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "I don't know, but &lt;insert name&gt; does."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rachel doesn't really know how money, evolution, or physics work, but she's</i><br>
<i>&gt; used to the notion that they are the underlying causes of things, so later</i><br>
<i>&gt; when she learns about them, she'll have the right attitude.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I suppose what makes me an Extropian child-rearer is that I never use any of</i><br>
<i>&gt; these old standbys:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "God made it that way."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Because I say so."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "It just is."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "You wouldn't understand."</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Good little girls don't ask so many questions."</i><br>
<p>
Yes, these root-causes probably reveal a lot about the parents. Shows<br>
some of the basic assumptions of their respective world views ("final<br>
causes").<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I am willing to go over her head, if I have to, rather than leave a question</i><br>
<i>&gt; unanswered.  But I've always found stuff that was over my head very</i><br>
<i>&gt; educational, so why should I deny that to her?  It's amazing how she retains</i><br>
<i>&gt; stuff that must seem like random gibberish to her, only to connect it later</i><br>
<i>&gt; to something else.</i><br>
<p>
And she will associate the stuff with her questions, so given the<br>
above dialogue she would now associate eating healthy food ("cave<br>
people food") and bacteria with evolution, which later will prove to<br>
be generally correct. It is a bit like gradually tying together a web<br>
of interconnections. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; PS.  The why-chains last between three and six steps before grounding out in</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of the root causes.  Does this tell us something about ontology,</i><br>
<i>&gt; something about epistemology, or nothing important?</i><br>
<p>
Hmm, in a text about creativity I found somewhere it suggested<br>
following the why-chain for 5 steps in order to analyze a problem. <br>
The length may depend on how large mental leaps one makes between<br>
each step, but I wonder if that is all there is to it. In some sense<br>
it is a reverse 20-questions game where you tend to move towards<br>
generality rather than specificity. <br>
