A male perjorative that I have heard in several contexts is "cowboy",<br>
usually used to describe someone who is being ham-fisted and mindless<br>
when finesse and thought are required.  I first hit this one in the<br>
general aviation industry, as a term for incompetent pilots.  (I<br>
recall there were convincing statistics that up through about 300<br>
hours of flight time, women were far better pilots than men; after<br>
that, men's abilities rose to equal those of women.)  I have also<br>
heard it used by automobile racing drivers, with similar meaning.<br>
I'm not sure it would be as popular in cattle country...<br>
<p>
One also hears the slang "testosterone poisoning" used in perjoratives<br>
for men who, e.g., have too much ego and too little sense.<br>
<p>
My favorite example of a pair of words whose denotative meanings are<br>
(approximately) mere gender-specific terms for the same thing (like<br>
"he" and "she"), but whose connotative meanings are very different, is<br>
"master" and "mistress".<br>
