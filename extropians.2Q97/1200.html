Internetworking in the Navy -- R. Brian Adamson, Naval<br>
Research Laboratory (Excerpted from "IPng Internet<br>
Protocol Next Generation", Scott O. Bradner, Allison<br>
Mankin, ed., Addision Wesley, 1996, pp. 27-35.).<br>
<p>
The U.S. Navy and other armed services have identified<br>
critical requirements for security, mobility, real-time<br>
data-delivery applications, multicast, and<br>
quality-of-service and policy-based routing of the next<br>
generation of the Internet Protocol. Address scaling<br>
for military application of internet technology may<br>
include very large numbers of local (interplatform)<br>
distributed information and weapons systems and a<br>
smaller number of nodes requiring global connectivity.<br>
The flexibility of the current Internet Protocol (IP)<br>
for supporting widely different communication media<br>
should be preserved to meed the needs of the highly<br>
heterogenous networks of the tactical environment.<br>
<p>
Compact protocol headers are necessary for efficient<br>
data transfer on the relatively low throughput radio<br>
frequency (RF) systems. Mechanisms which can enhance<br>
the effectiveness of an internet datagram protocol<br>
to provide resource reservation, priority, and<br>
service quality guarantees are also very important.<br>
The broadcast nature of many RF networks and the need<br>
for broad dissemination of information to war-fighting<br>
participants makes multicast the general case for<br>
information flow in the tactical environment.<br>
<p>
&lt;b&gt;Naval Research Efforts.&lt;/b&gt; The requirements for<br>
the Internet protocol next generation (IPng) candidates<br>
with respect to their application to military tactical<br>
RF communication networks need to be considered along<br>
with private concerns. The foundatons for these<br>
requirements are experiences born of the Navy's<br>
research efforts in this area: the NATO Communication<br>
System Network Interoperability (CSNI) project;<br>
the Naval Research Laboratory Data/Voice Integration<br>
Advanced Technology Demonstration (D/V ATD), and the<br>
Navy Communication Support System (CSS) architecture<br>
development.<br>
<p>
&lt;b&gt;NATO Communication System Network Interoperability<br>
Project.&lt;/b&gt; The goal of the CSNI project is to apply<br>
internetworking technology to facilitate multinational<br>
interoperability for typical military communication<br>
applications (e.g., electronic messaging, tactical data<br>
exchange, and digital voice) on typical tactical RF<br>
communication links and networks. The International<br>
Standard Organization (ISO) Open Systems Interconnect<br>
(OSI) protocol suite, including the Connectionless<br>
Network Protocol (CLNP), was selected for this project<br>
for policy reasons. There are design issues in meeting<br>
the project goals with this particular protocol stack.<br>
<p>
&lt;b&gt;Naval Research Laboratory's Data/Voice Integration<br>
advanced Technology Demonstration.&lt;/b&gt; The D/V ATD is<br>
focused on demonstrating a survivable, self-configuring,<br>
self-recovering RF subnetwork technology capable of<br>
simultaneously supporting data delivery, including<br>
message transfer, imagery, tactical data, and<br>
real-time digital voice applications. Support for<br>
real-time interactive communication application was<br>
extended to include a "white board" and other similiar<br>
applications. IP datagram delivery is also planned<br>
as part of this demonstration system.<br>
<p>
&lt;b&gt;Navy Communication Support System Architecture<br>
Development.&lt;/b&gt; The CSS architecture will provide<br>
U.S. Navy tactical platforms with a broad array of<br>
user-transparent voice and data information exchange<br>
services. This will include support for sharing and<br>
management of limited platform communicaiton resources<br>
among multiple war-fighting communities. Emphasis is<br>
placed on attaining interoperability of with other<br>
military services and foreign allies. Utilization of<br>
commercial off-the-shelf communication products to<br>
take advantage of existing economies of scale is<br>
important to make any resulting system design<br>
affordable. It is anticipated that open, voluntary<br>
standards, and flexible communication protocols, such<br>
as IP, will play a key role in meeting the goals of<br>
this architecture.<br>
<p>
&lt;b&gt;IPng Requirements and RFC-1550.&lt;/b&gt; Before<br>
addressing and IPng requirements as applied to<br>
tactical RF comminications, it is necessary to<br>
define what is meant by "IPng requirements".<br>
To maintain brevity, the criteria described in<br>
this section are specifically related to the<br>
design of an OSI model's Layer 3 protocol format<br>
and a few other areas suggested by RFC-1550.<br>
There are also several additional areas of<br>
concern in applying intrenetwork protocols to<br>
the military tactical RF setting:<br>
<p>
    * routing protocol design<br>
    * address assignment<br>
    * network management<br>
    * resource management<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Scale.&lt;/i&gt; The requirement that IPng should be<br>
able to deal with 10^12 nodes {{hah! never heard of<br>
nanotechnology, apparently. why do we never learn?}}<br>
is more than adequate in the face of military<br>
requirements. More importantly, with IPng it must be<br>
possible to assign adresses efficiently. For example,<br>
although a military platform may have a relatively<br>
small number of nodes with requirements to<br>
communicate with a larger, global infrastructure,<br>
there will be likely applications of IPng to<br>
management and control of distributed systems<br>
(e.g., specific radio communications equipement<br>
and processors, weapon systems) within the platform.<br>
This local expansion of address space requirements<br>
may not necessarily need to be solved by "sheer numbers"<br>
of globally unique addresses but perhaps by alternate<br>
delimitations of addressing to differentiate between<br>
globally unique and localy unique addressing. The<br>
advantages of a compact internet address header<br>
are clear for relatively low capacity RF networks.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Transition.&lt;/i&gt; The Navy and other armed<br>
services are currently (in the past few years)<br>
designing and deploying systems that use open<br>
networking technology. From this point of view,<br>
the time scale for selecting of IPng must be<br>
somewhat rapid. Otherwise, two transition phases<br>
will need to be suffered: 1) the move from unique<br>
"stove pipe" systems to open, internetworked<br>
(e.g.; IP) systems, and 2) a transition from<br>
deployed IP-based systems to IPng. In some sense<br>
if an IPng is quickly accepted and widely<br>
implemented, the transition for tactical<br>
military systems will be somewhat easier than<br>
the enterprise Internet where a large investment<br>
in current IP already exists. However, having<br>
said this, the Department of Defense as a whole<br>
already deploys a large number of IP-capable<br>
systems, and the issue of transition from IP to<br>
IPng remains significant.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Media Independence.&lt;/i&gt; The tactical communication<br>
environment includes a very broad spectrum {{spread-spectrum?<br>
;) }} of communication media from shipboard fiber-optic<br>
LANs to very low data rate (fewer than 2400 bps) RF links.<br>
Many of the RF links, evne higher speed ones, can exhibit<br>
error statistics not necessarily well-serviced by higher<br>
layre reliable protocols (i.e., TCP). In these cases,<br>
efficient lower layer protocols can be implemented to<br>
provide reliable datagram delivery at the link layer, but<br>
at the cost of highly variable delay performance.<br>
<p>
It is also important to recognize that RF communication<br>
cannot be viewed from the IPng designer as simple<br>
point-to-point links.<br>
<p>
Often, highly complex, unique subnetwork protocols<br>
are utilized to meet requirements of survivability,<br>
communications performance with limited bandwith,<br>
anti-jam, and/or low probability of detection<br>
requirements.<br>
<p>
It is understood that IPng cannot be the panacea of Layer 3<br>
protocols, particularly when it comes to providing special<br>
mechanisms to support the endangered-species low data rate<br>
user. In some of these cases IPng will be one of several<br>
Layer 3 protocols sharing the subnetwork. However, note<br>
that there are potentially many low date rate, IP-based<br>
applications of value to the tactical user. Well-designed,<br>
efficient networking protocols, can allow many more users<br>
to share the limited avialable RF bandwidth. A significant<br>
fraction of data traffic in the tactical environment may<br>
consist of short datagram messages (e.g., position reports,<br>
fire control, etc.). Also, relatively low data rate links<br>
will also likely utilize relatively small packet MTU sizes.<br>
As a result, any mechanisms which facilitate compression<br>
of network headers are highly valuable in an IPng candidate.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Configuration, Administration, and Operation.&lt;/i&gt; The<br>
tactical military has very real requirements for multimedia<br>
services across its shared and interconnected RF networks.<br>
This includes applications from digital secure voice<br>
integrated with applications such as "white boards" and<br>
position reporting for mission planning purposes to low<br>
latency, high priority tactical data messages (target<br>
detection, identification, location, and heading information).<br>
Because of the limited capacity of tactical RF networks,<br>
resource reservation is extremely important to control<br>
access to these valuable resources. Resource reservation<br>
can play a role in "congestion avoidance" for these limited<br>
resources as well as ensuring that quality-of-service (QoS)<br>
data delivery requirements are met for multimedia communication.<br>
<p>
Note that this requires more than can be met by simple QoS-<br>
based path selection and subsequent source-routing to get<br>
realtime-data, such as voice, delivered. For example, to<br>
support digital voice in the CSNI project, a call setup and<br>
resource reservation protocol was designed. It was determined<br>
that the QoS mechanisms provided by CLNP specification were<br>
not sufficient for our voice application with path selection.<br>
Voice calls could not be routed adn resources reserved based<br>
on any single QoS parameter (e.g., delay, capacity) alone.<br>
Some RF subnets in the CSNI test bed simply did not have the<br>
capability to support voice calls.<br>
<p>
To perform resource reservation for the voice calls, the CLNP<br>
cost metric was "hijacked" as essentially as a Type-of-Service<br>
identifier to let the router know which datagrams were<br>
associated with a voicecall. The cost metric, concatenated<br>
with the source and destination addresses, were used to form<br>
a unique identifier for voice calls in the router and subnet<br>
state tables. Voice call paths were to be selected by the<br>
router (i.e., the "cost" metric was calculated) as a rule-based<br>
function of each subnet's capability to support voice, its delay,<br>
and its capacity.<br>
<p>
While source-routing provided as a possible means for voice<br>
datagrams to find their way from router to router, the network<br>
address alone was not explicit enough to direct the data to<br>
correct interface {{why? broken design, this!}}, particularly<br>
in cases where there were multiple communication media<br>
interconnecting two routers along the path. Fortunately,<br>
excluse use of the QoS indicator for voice in CSNI was able<br>
to serve as a flag to the router for packets requiring<br>
special handling.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Flow specification.&lt;/i&gt; While a simple Type-of-Service<br>
field as part of an IPng protocol can serve this purpose where<br>
there are a limited number of well-known services (CSNI has<br>
a single special service: 2400 bps digital voice), a more<br>
general technique such as RSVP's Flow Specification can<br>
support a larger set of such services. And a field, such as<br>
the one sometimes referred to as a Flow Identification (Flow ID),<br>
can play an important role in facilitating internetworking<br>
data communication over these limited capacity networks.<br>
<p>
For example, the D/V ATD RF sub-network provides support<br>
for both connectionless datagram delivery and virtual circuit<br>
connectivity. To utilize this capacity, an IPng could establish<br>
a virtual circuit connection across this RF subnetwork which<br>
meets the requirements of an RSVP Flow Specification. By creating<br>
an assotiation between a particular Flow ID and the subnetwork<br>
header identifying the established virtual circuit, and IPng<br>
gateway could forward data across the low-capacity link while<br>
removing most, if not all, of the IPng header information.<br>
The receiving gateway could re-construct these fields based on<br>
the Flow Specification of the particular Flow ID/virtual circuit<br>
association.<br>
<p>
A field such as a Flow ID can serve at least two important<br>
purposes:<br>
<p>
    * It can be used by routers (or gateways) to identify<br>
      packets with special, or pre-arranged delivery<br>
      requirements. It is important to realize that it<br>
      may not always be possible to "peek" at internet<br>
      packet content for this information if certain<br>
      security considerations are met (e.g., an encrypted<br>
      transport layer).<br>
<p>
    * It can air mapping datagram services to different<br>
      types of communication services provided by special<br>
      subnet/data link layers protocols.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Secure Operation.&lt;/i&gt; As with any military system,<br>
information security, including confidentiality and<br>
authenticity of data, is of paramount importance. With<br>
regard to IPng, network layer security mechanisms for<br>
tactical RF networks are generally important for<br>
authentication purposes, including routing protocol<br>
authentication, source authentication, and user network<br>
access control. Concerns for denial of service attacks,<br>
traffic analysis monitoring, etc., usually dictate that<br>
tactical RF communication networks provide link layer<br>
security mechanisms.<br>
<p>
Compartmentalization and multiple levels of security<br>
for different users of common communication resources<br>
call for additional security mechanisms at the transport<br>
layer or above. In the typical tactical RF environment,<br>
network layer confidentiality, and in some cases even<br>
authentication, becomes redundant with these other<br>
security mechanisms.<br>
<p>
The need for network layer security mechanisms becomes<br>
more critical when the military utilizes commercial<br>
communication systems or has tactical systems<br>
interconnected with commercial internets. While the<br>
Network Encryption Server (NES) works in this role<br>
today, there is a desire for a more integrated, higher<br>
performance solution in the future. Thus, to meet the<br>
military requirements for confidentiality and<br>
authentication, an IPng candidate must be capable at<br>
operating in a secure manner when necessary, but also<br>
allow for efficient operation on low throughput RF<br>
links when other security mechanisms are already in<br>
place.<br>
<p>
In either of these cases, key management is extremely<br>
important. Ideally, a common key management system<br>
could be used to provide key distribution for security<br>
mechanisms at any layer from the application to the<br>
link layer. As a result, it is anticipated, however,<br>
that key distribution is a function of management, and<br>
should not be dependant on a particular IPng protocol<br>
format.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Multicast.&lt;/i&gt; Tactical military communication has<br>
a very clear requirement for multicast. Efficient<br>
dissemiation of information to distributed war-fighting<br>
participants can be the key to success in a battle.<br>
<p>
In modren warfare, this information includes imagery,<br>
the "tactical scene" via tactical data messages,<br>
messaging information, and real-time interactive<br>
applications such as digital secure voice. Many of<br>
the tactical RF communication media are broadcast by<br>
nature, and multicast routing can take advantage of<br>
this topology to distribute critical data to a large<br>
number of participants. The throughput limitations<br>
imposed by these RF media and the physics of potential<br>
electronic counter measures (ECM) dictate that this<br>
information be distributed efficiently. A multicast<br>
architecture is the general case for information flow<br>
in a tactical network.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Extensibility.&lt;/i&gt; Quality of service and policy<br>
based routing are of particular importance in a<br>
tactical environment with limited communication<br>
resources, limited bandwidth, and possible degradation<br>
and/or denial of service. Priority is a very important<br>
criteria in the tactical setting. In the tactical RF<br>
world of limited resources (limited bandwidth, radio<br>
assets, etc.) thre will be instances when there is not<br>
sufficient capacity to provide all users with with<br>
their perception of required communication capability.<br>
<p>
It is extremely important for a shared, automated<br>
communication system to to delegate capacity to higher<br>
priority users. Unlike the commercial world, where<br>
everyone has more equal footing, it is possible in<br>
the military environment to assign priority to users<br>
or even individual datagrams. An example of this is the<br>
tactical data exchange. Tactical data messages are<br>
generally single-datagram messages containing information<br>
on the location, bearing, identification, etc., of<br>
entities detected by sensors. In CSNI, tactical data<br>
messages were assigned 15 different levels of CLNP<br>
priority. This ensured that important messages, such<br>
as a rapidly approaching enemy missile's trajectory,<br>
were given priority over less important messages,<br>
such as a friendly, slow-moving tanker's heading.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Applicability.&lt;/i&gt; There will be a significant<br>
amount of applicability to tactical RF networks. The<br>
current IP and CLNP are bing considerable attention<br>
in the tactical RF community as a means to provide<br>
communication interoperability across a large set of<br>
heterogenous RF networks in use by different services<br>
and countries. The applicability of IPng can only<br>
improve with the inclusion of features critical to<br>
supporting QoS and policy-based routing, security,<br>
real-time multi-media data delivery, and extended<br>
addressing. It must be noted that it is very important<br>
that the IPng protocol headers not grow overly large.<br>
There is a sharp tradeoff between the value added by<br>
these headers (interoperability, global addressing,<br>
etc.) and the degree of communication performance<br>
attainable on limited capacity RF networks. Regardless<br>
of the data rate that future RF networks will be capable<br>
of supporting, there is always a tactical advantage in<br>
utilizing your resources more efficiently.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Support for Mobility&lt;/i&gt; The definition of most<br>
tactical systems include mobility in some form. Many<br>
tactical RF network designs provide means for members<br>
to join and leave particular RF subnets as their<br>
position changes. For example, as a platform moves<br>
out of RF line-of-sight (LOS) range, it may switch<br>
from a typical LOS RF media such as the ultra-high<br>
frequency (UHF) band to a long-haul RF media such as<br>
high-frequency (HF) or satellite communications (SATCOM).<br>
<p>
In some cases, as the D/V ATD network, the RF subnet<br>
will perform its own routing and management of this<br>
dynamic topology. This will be invisible to the internet<br>
protocol except for subtle changes to some routing metrics<br>
(e.g., more or less delay to reach a host). In this<br>
instance, the RF subnetwork protocols serve as a buffer<br>
to the internet routing protocols and IPng will not need<br>
to be too concerned with mobility. In other cases, however,<br>
the platform may make a dramatic change in position and<br>
require a major change in internet routing. IPng must<br>
be able to support this situation. It is recognized that<br>
an internet protocol may not be able to cope with large,<br>
rapid changes in topology. {{!!! why? broken protocol}}<br>
Efforts will be made to minimize the frequency of this<br>
in a tactical RF communication architecture, but there<br>
are instances when a major change in topology is required.<br>
<p>
Furthermore, it should be realized that mobility in the<br>
tactical setting is not limited to individual nodes<br>
moving about, but that, in some cases, entire subnetworks<br>
may be moving. An example of this is a Navy ship with<br>
multiple LANs on board, moving through the domains of<br>
different RF networks. In some cases, the RF subnet will<br>
be moving, as in the case of an aricraft strike force, or<br>
Navy battlegroup.<br>
<p>
&lt;i&gt;Datagram service.&lt;/i&gt; The datagram service paradigm<br>
provides many useful features for tactical communication<br>
networks. The "memory" provided by datagram headers,<br>
provides an inherent amount of survivability essential<br>
to the dynamics of hte tactical communication environment.<br>
The availability of platforms for routing and relaying is<br>
never 100% certain in a tactical scenario. The efficiency<br>
with which multicast can be implemented in a connectionless<br>
network is highly critical in the tactical environment<br>
where rapid, eficient information dissemination can be<br>
a deciding factor. And, as it has been proven with several<br>
different Internet applications and experiments, a<br>
datagram service is capable of providing useful connection-<br>
oriented and real-time connection services.<br>
<p>
Consideration should be given in IPng to how it can co-exist<br>
with other architectures usch as switching fabrics which<br>
offer demand-based control over topology and connectivity.<br>
The military owns many of its own communication resources<br>
and one of the large problems in managing the military<br>
communication infrastructure is directing those underlying<br>
resources to where they are needed. Traditional management<br>
(SNMP, tec.) is of course useful here, but RF communication<br>
media can be somewhat dynamically allocated.<br>
<p>
Circuit switching designs offer some advantages here.<br>
Dial-up IP routing is an example of an integrated solution.<br>
The IPng should be capable of supporti4g a similiar type of<br>
operation.<br>
