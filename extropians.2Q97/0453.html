<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Max Planck started the entire revolution by proposing that energy is</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;NOT continuous, everything followed from there. Take a beam of light</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;for example, it has momentum nhf, h is the Planck constant, f is the</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;frequency of the light, and n is an INTEGER, the number of photons.</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Digital.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Dejan Vucinic &lt;dejan@mit.edu&gt;</i><br>
<i>        &gt;The formula is correct, but your conclusion is not.  While n is an</i><br>
<i>        &gt;integer, f is not.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
If some physical property comes in units, 1c, 2c, 3c, 4c, ... then that  <br>
property (in this case momentum) is digital, the constant c can be pi, e, or <br>
any real number except zero, it does not matter. The absolute value of one <br>
unit is not important, the point is that the difference between one unit and <br>
the next comes in steps, integers. Digital.<br>
        <br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;If you want to find the momentum of an individual photon, hf, you </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;can find it by using the formula hN/X , h is the Planck constant </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;again, and N is the number of wave crests the photon makes over a </i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;distance X. Digital.</i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Dejan:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;Another wrong conclusion.  One: N is not an integer.  A photon that</i><br>
<i>        &gt;has one "crest" over one meter has one point three crests over one</i><br>
<i>        &gt;point three meters.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
1.3 crests? Is that anything like 1.3 pregnancies? As I said, as you get to <br>
the end of distance X there will always be uncertainty over whether something <br>
is a crest or not, but the uncertainty can be made arbitrary small simply<br>
by making X larger because that increases the number of crests you are <br>
certain about and leaves the number you are uncertain of unchanged. Now you <br>
have better knowledge about what the momentum is, but because X is now larger<br>
you have less knowledge about where the photon is.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Two: the number of crests depends on the frame of reference.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Everything depends of the frame of reference, except the speed of light. <br>
All photons will be red shifted or blue shifted, the amount of the shift will <br>
depends on how fast you're moving relative to the source, and at any instant <br>
the shift will be a constant for all atoms of any element in the source. <br>
                         <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Counting crests of photons is a mental crutch.  </i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why? Seems like a perfectly respectable activity to me, absolutely nothing to <br>
be ashamed of, it's entirely natural, just part of life. Physicists do it, <br>
engineers do it, even educated technicians do it. Let's do it, let's count <br>
wave crests.                <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;In reality, what you can do is measure the energy of your pet photon.  </i><br>
<i>        &gt;Unfortunately, in the process you're destroying the photon itself, so </i><br>
<i>        &gt;the accuracy of your measurement is not constrained by the Heisenberg </i><br>
<i>        &gt;inequality, but rather by the construction of your apparatus.  </i><br>
        <br>
        <br>
You can measure the energy of a photon as accurately as you want but<br>
regardless of how good your apparatus is, the more you find out about the <br>
position of a photon, or anything else for that matter, the less will be<br>
your knowledge of its momentum.<br>
                            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;And you are right in that randomness is not a continuous quantity.</i><br>
<i>        &gt;In fact, it's not a quantity at all, it's  a concept people have</i><br>
<i>        &gt;trouble imagining because it's not "intuitive".  </i><br>
        <br>
<p>
When we say we understand some physical phenomena we mean we have found the      <br>
cause, randomness by definition is a phenomenon that has no cause, so if we<br>
don't understand it, it's only because there is nothing to understand.<br>
        <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;However, an incredible mountain of evidence suggests that quantum </i><br>
<i>        &gt;mechanics is how universe works</i><br>
        <br>
<p>
True, but it's not randomness that makes Quantum Mechanics so weird, it's<br>
spooky action at a distance, retroactive causes, and the question of<br>
exactly what an observer is and is not that makes it all so bazaar. The crazy <br>
experiments that proved Bell's inequality is violated should not have turned <br>
out the way they did, but they did.<br>
            <br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;&gt;Me:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;If you want to find the energy of a photon multiply the digital</i><br>
<i>        &gt;&gt;momentum by a constant, the speed of light. </i><br>
<p>
<i>        &gt;Dejan:</i><br>
<i>        &gt;No, it just says that our historical choice of units for "energy"</i><br>
<i>        &gt;and "momentum" was arbitrary, so we invented a "constant" to make</i><br>
<i>        &gt;it sound less embarrasing.   </i><br>
<p>
<p>
What on earth are you talking about? Plank's constant h comes in units <br>
momentum times length, wavelength comes in units of length, divide the Plank<br>
constant by wavelength and you get the momentum of the photon, it's true<br>
here, there, and everywhere. Use the Metric system, or the English system, <br>
or the measuring system favored by the 3 headed 5 armed 7 eyed creatures of <br>
the Virgo cluster, it doesn't matter in the slightest, c  will still come in <br>
units of length divided by time, and if you want to find the energy of a <br>
photon multiply the momentum by the speed of light, and the speed of light is <br>
a constant, always, everywhere. <br>
<p>
<p>
<i>        &gt;in the Universe and in my  current profession c == h == 1.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
One what? c and h do not come in the same units, but the units are related, <br>
sure you could change the size of the units of c and make c whatever you want, <br>
but then h would have to be fixed.                  <br>
