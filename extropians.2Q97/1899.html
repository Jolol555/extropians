Scientists at North Carolina University have announced that they are <br>
very near to perfecting a male birth control pill.  <br>
<p>
&lt;pause while kathryn dances a little jig&gt;<br>
<p>
The pill is projected to be cheap to produce, with no side effects <br>
and 98% effectiveness.  It works by effectively 'blinding' the sperm <br>
(not killing them).  Also, one week after ceasing the pill, a man <br>
would return to full fertility.  That's a much better deal than the <br>
female pill, which is implicated in many immunological disorders and <br>
takes several months to reverse.  <br>
<p>
We shall have to wait five years for this pill to get to the market, <br>
but maybe people could get it by volunteering for testing programs.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
