I just joined the Science-News list and thought it might be of some<br>
interest to people on this list. The first summary I received seemed to<br>
have several issues of interest to those on this list. If anyone knows the<br>
background of the list I'd be interested.<br>
<p>
I've attached this weeks mailout so people can assess it to see whether it<br>
before joining.<br>
<p>
best,  patrick<br>

<p>
NASA ABANDONS MONKEY SPACE EXPERIMENT<br>
Following pressure from animal-rights advocates and their<br>
political allies, NASA has announced it will abandon the Bion<br>
life sciences project undertaken with Russia and France that<br>
tests the effects of weightlessness on monkeys in space. A death<br>
of one of the monkeys in January apparently provoked the review<br>
and decision to eliminate the program.<br>
<p>
NADER GROUP CALLS AIDS TRIALS UNETHICAL<br>
Ralph Nader's Public Citizen's Organization has charged that<br>
international AIDS therapy trials in developing countries are<br>
unethical. The basis of the accusation is that patients given<br>
placebos rather than the drug AZT are compromised by not re-<br>
ceiving the most effective treatment for the disease. Health<br>
officials state that on the contrary the studies are ethical<br>
and are vital for international treatment of the AIDS epidemic.<br>
Nader held a press conference on 22 April.<br>
<p>
CHINESE SCIENTISTS HAVE SUCCESS PREDICTING EARTHQUAKES<br>
Earthquakes in a region occur either in isolation or in groups.<br>
Chinese seismologists have now reported success in imminent<br>
prediction of earthquakes that occur in a group. Apparently,<br>
during the past several months, hundreds of thousands of people<br>
were evacuated on short notice in the interior of China,<br>
avoiding many deaths that might have resulted from the<br>
magnitude-6 earthquakes in the region. Western seismologists,<br>
who have not yet seen the data of their Chinese colleagues, are<br>
reserved but are not all skeptical.<br>
<p>
CATALYTIC COMPONENT OF TELOMERASE APPARENTLY IDENTIFIED<br>
Telomerase, the enzyme that rebuilds chromosome ends after cell<br>
division, and an enzyme that may play a key role in cancer and<br>
aging, has been under intensive investigation in many<br>
laboratories. J. Lingner, et al, of the University of Colorado<br>
(Boulder CO), the Baylor College of Medicine (Houston TX), and<br>
the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (Heidelberg, Germany)<br>
have now isolated and identified a protein subunit of telomerase<br>
which apparently acts as the catalytic component of the enzyme.<br>
<p>
NEW CONTROVERSY OVER ORIGIN OF GAMMA RAY BURSTS<br>
Flashes of gamma rays in outer space, called Gamma Ray Bursts,<br>
are mysterious occurrences whose origins are unresolved.<br>
Astronomers differ as to whether GRBs originate close to our<br>
galaxy or billions of light years away. Now conflicting<br>
interpretations of orbiting earth satellite data and data from<br>
the Hubble Space Telescope have made the controversy even<br>
sharper, with one group reporting their analysis of the data<br>
indicates the source of a recent GRB is in movement. Astronomers<br>
are hopeful further data from the Hubble Space Telescope will<br>
resolve the issue.<br>
<p>
CLAIM OF A COSMIC AXIS DISPUTED<br>
The recent claim of a discovered asymmetry in the universe by<br>
Noland (University of Rochester) and Ralston (University of<br>
Kansas) has come under fire from physicists and radio<br>
astronomers. No one has detected a fatal error in the<br>
Noland-Ralston calculations, but critics say their analysis used<br>
old data and ignored much of the more recent observations of<br>
signals from radio galaxies. What everyone agrees upon is that<br>
such asymmetry, if it exists, would overturn much of cosmology,<br>
including Einstein's Theory of Relativity. A consensus appears<br>
to be forming that the supposed asymmetry will vanish once<br>
better data are used for analysis.<br>
<p>
POSSIBLE FUNCTION FOR BREAST CANCER GENES IDENTIFIED<br>
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are known breast cancer susceptibility genes,<br>
discovered in 1994 and 1995. Allan Bradley (Baylor College of<br>
Medicine, Houston TX) and Paul Hasty (Lexicon Genetics Inc., The<br>
Woodlands TX) have now reported that a protein made by BRCA2<br>
plays a critical role in cell repair of DNA damage. It has been<br>
thought that both cancer genes are somehow involved in tumor<br>
suppression, but it now appears the role of these genes may be<br>
in producing proteins vital for DNA repair and the suppression<br>
of mutations.<br>
<p>
NEW VACCINES REPORTED FOR URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS<br>
Urinary tract infections (UTI) occur in 8.5 million women in the<br>
U.S. each year, and in many millions more women elsewhere. The<br>
culprit is usually the bacterium E. Coli. Researchers at<br>
MedImmune, a Maryland research company, and at Washington<br>
University (St. Louis MO) have reported they have developed a<br>
genetically engineered injectable vaccine that prevents UTI in<br>
mice. Human trials of a vaccine delivered via suppository are<br>
already underway at the University of Wisconsin (Madison WI).<br>
<p>
SUPPOSED CANCER GENE APPEARS IN DEVELOPMENT<br>
The gene DCC has been previously implicated in colorectal<br>
cancer, its absence used as a marker in such cancers, and the<br>
prevailing idea has been that it is a tumor suppressor gene<br>
whose absence provokes carcinogenesis. Three independent groups<br>
of researchers are now reporting that DCC plays an important<br>
role in the development of the embryonic nervous system, DCC and<br>
related genes producing receptor proteins that interpret<br>
directional signals used by migrating cells or developing<br>
neurons. DCC, therefore, may not be a cancer gene at all, but<br>
merely a tag-along to an actual tumor suppressor gene.<br>
<p>
A NOVEL CLASS OF MOLECULAR CRYSTALS<br>
Victoria A. Russell and her colleagues at the University of<br>
Minnesota report the crystal engineering of molecular sandwiches<br>
with adjustable porosity. The arrays are a new class of<br>
molecular crystals based on two-dimensional hydrogen-bond<br>
networks. The adjustable flexibility of the networks will allow<br>
crystal engineers to design arrays specific for particular guest<br>
molecules.<br>
<p>
DEVELOPMENT OF A SINGLE-ELECTRON TRANSISTOR MICROSCOPE<br>
M. J. Yoo (Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs., presently at Philips<br>
Labs.) reports the construction and use of a single-electron<br>
transistor scanning microscope capable of mapping static<br>
electric fields and charges with 100-nanometer spatial<br>
resolution and a charge sensitivity of a small fraction of an<br>
electron. The device should be of significance in determining<br>
the detailed architecture of semiconductor surfaces.<br>
<p>
NEUROGENESIS OBSERVED IN POSTNATAL SPINAL CORD<br>
Permanent paralysis resulting from spinal cord injuries is due<br>
to the inability of the adult mammalian spinal cord to replace<br>
damaged neurons. Lois J. Kehl and her colleagues at the<br>
University of Minnesota report the presence of neuronal<br>
precursor cells in rat postnatal spinal cord, such cells<br>
retaining the ability to be transformed into functional neurons.<br>
Results are of importance to therapeutic approaches to<br>
restoration of function in humans with spinal cord injuries.<br>
<p>
CONTINUOUS IN VITRO EVOLUTION OF CATALYTIC FUNCTION<br>
Martin C. Wright and Gerald F. Joyce (Scripps Research<br>
Institute) have subjected a population of RNA molecules to<br>
repeated rounds of selective amplification and mutation,<br>
specifically 300 selective rounds in 52 hours. The result was<br>
the evolution of a population of RNA molecules with<br>
substantially improved catalytic power. They report this<br>
continuous in vitro evolution can be perpetuated indefinitely.<br>
