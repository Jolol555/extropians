Bad thing with them, you can work just a few hours in untethered mode. <br>
Admittedly, this is rarely required. I'd still like a solar augmented fuel<br>
cell, for religion reasons. Roaming is getting better, but one'd still<br>
need Iridium to be a "go-anywhere" technomad. Iridium is going to be<br>
expensive, though, I wonder about what Teledesic's rates might be (nudge, <br>
nudge).<br>
<p>
I am really looking forward to wearables, with really adequate headup,<br>
large storage and sophisticated GUIs. Using cellphones has become socially<br>
acceptable very rapidly, I wonder however how long it takes until people<br>
with headsets, heavy hipbelts and black monocles, with a micro CCD<br>
embedded, while babbling to invisible presences, won't raise eyebrows<br>
anymore. I think Linux to be an excellent platform (most of the MIT<br>
wearables used it), albeit speech input was pretty nonexistant half a year<br>
ago. As PC hardware has the embedded microcontroller market now pervaded,<br>
cheap low-juice hardware should be quite easy to get. Any proprietary<br>
distributed embedded solution would be superiour, but clearly noviable due<br>
to nonexistant software base. I am still waiting for any major outfit<br>
having the guts to challenge the PC cul de sac, by build a consumer maspar<br>
DSP box. This sure'd be a reason for throwing a major party.<br>
<p>
Those who are signed up with a CSP are going to need an automatic<br>
emergency pager anyway, so'd they'd be using biotelemetry, and a<br>
cellmodem, already. Consider this a CFI (call for ideas) for just such a<br>
pager; which can be incrementally morphed into a wearable. I know Hara Ra<br>
is interested in building just a gadget, prior to that we the local Kraut<br>
cryos had also plans which were progressed pretty far, but which died due<br>
to insufficient funding. I'd still like this to result in a viable design,<br>
whether commercial, or in the public domain.<br>

<p>
True. I am going to scan and OCR the bulk of my library in the course of<br>
next years, though.  Some of the relevant stuff isn't on the net yet, and<br>
some never will. <br>
 <br>
ciao,<br>
'gene<br>
<p>
P.S. I'm reading up on some peculiar crackpot topics just now. I have now<br>
firmly identified Bohm as the originator of the quantum mind conspiracy. <br>
I have found early Kauffman in "Kinetic Logic -- A Boolean Approach to the<br>
Analysis of Complex Regulatory Systems", a 1977 Lecture Notes in<br>
Biomathematics Proceedings in Brussels. "Vision, Instuction and Action" <br>
by David Chapman is a great read on how far brittle AI is going to get us<br>
(this is an expert system playing an arcade game. It uses vision, but it<br>
does not ANN nor GA). The "Art of Molecular Dynamics" by D.C. Rapaport is<br>
a good in-depth introduction for those interested in modeling nanotech. I<br>
am reading an ancient Russian book on design of spacecraft, the book on<br>
mail from Marshall T. Rose's Internet trilogy. I also came across early De<br>
Garis, his LIZZY (GA evolving neural control) sounds very cool. As an<br>
uploader, I am worried about suspected CA-like computation properties of<br>
microtubulin, though this has fair chance of being bogus, having been<br>
published in the infamous "Rethinking Neural Networks: Quantum Fields and<br>
Biological Data". <br>
