I'm not a nutrition expert, but this sounds highly unlikely (and just the<br>
kind of "common sense" explanation that seems to be so common in<br>
non-scientific dieting). The epithelium in the guts doesn't absorb<br>
nutrients in special ratios, it just absorbs available nutrients and let's<br>
the liver deal with them. If you eat too little of one EAA you will still<br>
get enough of the other amino acids. <br>
<p>
It should be noted that it is fairly rare to have deficiencies in the diet<br>
of EAAs, since they are quite common in general. According to a chemistry<br>
text I found somewhere, it makes evolutionary sense not to vaste<br>
metabolism making amino acids that you can easily get from your food. So<br>
my guess is that combining foods is just a simple strategy to be sure you<br>
have all nutrients you need by ingesting a bigger mixture, nothing more,<br>
nothing less. It should be noted that animalic food contains all EAA, it<br>
is just vegans who need to worry (?) about them and eat a somewhat more<br>
diverse diet. <br>
