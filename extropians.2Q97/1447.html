The Tragic Story of Romeo and Juliet by William Vibrnuke<br>
<p>
Romeo and Juliet was written after comedy The Taming of the Goo; <br>
while the comedies of Vibrnuke were most popular in his day, the<br>
modern public admires his great dramas HamNet, Router of Denmark, The<br>
Agent of Venice and of course Romeo and Juliet. The plot follows in<br>
condensed form: <br>
<p>
The play takes place a long time ago in the Dyson sphere Renaissance<br>
Vector.  The sphere is torn by internal conflict between the<br>
borganisms belonging to the MNTG series and the exconomist<br>
transindividuals of Caput Letis Inc.<br>
<p>
During a masquerade in virtual reality Romeo of MNTG, a young<br>
borganism, meets Juliet, vice CEO of CapuLet, and falls in love. <br>
Secretly entering her file areas after the masquerade he discovers an<br>
emotion analysis showing him that his feelings are answered; he sends<br>
a dividual to her orbital where a classic dialogue ensues between<br>
Juliet standing in the docking bay at the axis and the Romeo-dividual<br>
below in the hydroponic garden. They decide to marry. Together they<br>
seek out a wise old Jupiter brain, who secretly marries them to each<br>
other.<br>
<p>
But the struggle between the MNTG and CapLet continues, and Cobalt, a<br>
relative of Juliet forcibly individualises a dear friend of Romeo<br>
with a computer virus. Overcome with rage Romeo assimilates Cobalt<br>
and nivellizes his mind. The CapLet group convinces the Ring Council<br>
PPL to banish Romeo to the outer sectors, since there was no proof of<br>
Cobalt's deed and their contract with the MNTG series doesn't cover<br>
involuntary borganization.  Before moving his habitats outwards a<br>
dividual of him visits Juliet, and they briefly merge. <br>
<p>
The CapLet group seeks a strategic alliance with the ParaIce group,<br>
and the market consensus suggests that Juliet should marry their CEO<br>
to consolidate.  Unable to openly go against the market (revealing<br>
her liaison with a borganism would put confidence their security<br>
procedures into question) and in love with Romeo she seeks out the<br>
Jupiter brain. It suggests a clever plan: using a nanodevice he will<br>
distribute her mind into inert net-packets, making it look like she<br>
died. He will send a signal to Romeo, who will send back a few<br>
dividuals to escort her to the outer sectors as she is re-assembled<br>
and awakens. <br>
<p>
The plan is set into motion. Juliet appears to die in mental<br>
dissolution, and her inert body is biosuspended in the corporate<br>
vault. But the message from the Jupiter brain never reaches Romeo in<br>
time due to an unfavourable conjunction of their orbits; instead<br>
Romeo hears the news of Juliet's death first and blocks out the<br>
message from the Jupiter brain. Overcome with anguish he sends his<br>
dividuals to Renaissance Vector, where they attack the CEO of the<br>
ParaIce group and enter the corporate vault. Finding Juliet dead<br>
breaks Romeo's hearts, and he disintegrates into individuals. Juliet<br>
reassembles and awakes, finds Romeo dissolved and erases herself. The<br>
MNTG series and CapLet Inc. reconsider their policies.<br>
