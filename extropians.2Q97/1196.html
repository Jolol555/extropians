Hi, everyone.  Brian Davis here.  I've been reading the digest for<br>
months, but never got around to piping up.<br>
<p>
I've been developing an interest in yestertech recently; steam engines,<br>
air wells, flying wings, etcetera.  Specifically I'm looking for devices<br>
that were supposed to be "the next big thing" but that never really<br>
caught on.<br>
<p>
I'm thinking of putting together some sort of museum exhibit celebrating<br>
ignored and forgotten devices, schemes and plans.  <br>
<p>
After all, in the 1990s people think that nanotechnology is the next big<br>
thing.  But what ever happened to those undersea cities that people were<br>
discussing constructing back in the 1950s?  How about countless other<br>
futurological fads that never came about, but were so hot at the 1939<br>
World's Fair?<br>
<p>
And what about Scarecrow's brain?<br>
<p>
<p>
If any extropians out there know of some resources I might tap, please<br>
contact me.  I've been mining Kurt Saxon's books, and what I can find<br>
from the aforementioned World's Fair, but I'm sure that I've just<br>
scratched the surface of The Gernsbach Continuum<br>
