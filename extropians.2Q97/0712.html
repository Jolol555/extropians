<i>&gt; Here's a tip: in the header of your pages, put a paragraph of 0 size</i><br>
<i>&gt; type that has multiple copies of all the key words and phrases. Since</i><br>
<i>&gt; the header is what gets read first, even engines that read only the</i><br>
<i>&gt; first 50 or 100 words will flag you as having multiple mentions of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; key phrases you think people will use to search with, so your pages will</i><br>
<i>&gt; come up first on the returns list as having the most relevancy to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; query.</i><br>
<p>
No!  No!  Never do such a hideous, incompatible, dishonest thing like<br>
that.  Some search engines have expressed interest in taking appropriate<br>
countermeasures to such subversion, and I applaud them for doing so.<br>
HTML written correctly, with keywords placed once in the header in META<br>
tags, with headers marked properly and not obscured by Netscape tricks,<br>
with ALT text in all the images, and correctly spelled and structured,<br>
will be well-indexed by every present search engine, and any future<br>
engines that base their algorithms on the design of HTML.  Wasting one's<br>
time fooling the existing naive engines will only require you to redo<br>
it later, and detract from the value of efforts trying to make search<br>
engines useful.<br>
