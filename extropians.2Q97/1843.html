If representing the function of a brain requires simulating every atom<br>
in the brain then there's no point to creating uploads beyond the<br>
virtues of creating backup copies. However, it may well be that the<br>
number of bits required to effectively simulate a neuron is quite small,<br>
say less than 10^6. Making a neuron via biology is then an incredibly<br>
inefficient way to do so, and other approaches could provide many orders<br>
of magnitude improvements in size, speed and energy required. Also, an<br>
upload provides access to many of the abstractions which make computers<br>
so useful. For example, editing. As wetware I have only very, very<br>
limited access to editing myself. Or how about optimization and what-if<br>
scenarios, things done every day with spreadsheets? The list of<br>
possibilities is huge.<br>
