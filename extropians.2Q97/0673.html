<i>&gt;From: patrickw@cs.monash.edu.au (Patrick Wilken)</i><br>
<i>&gt;Date: Sat, 26 Apr 1997 15:21:53 +1000</i><br>
<i>&gt;I watched a documentary by David Suzuki on population growth recently. Paul</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ehrlich was featured prominently and his famous bet with Julian Simon about</i><br>
<i>&gt;commodity prices was also mentioned.</i><br>
         &lt;sniiiiiiiip&gt;<br>
<i>&gt;The story told in the documentary what that Ehrlich's group was basically</i><br>
<i>&gt;only allowed to chose metals - no other commodities were allowed. They also</i><br>
<i>&gt;didn't mention the amount of money he lost or the fact that he was able to</i><br>
<i>&gt;choose the time period.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;They did mentioned that much more recently there has been a second</i><br>
<i>&gt;challenge by Ehrlich to Simon, but that Simon had not taken up the bet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does anyone know what's become of this second bet? And what the true story</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the first bet is?</i><br>
<p>
I'm not sure about the 2nd bet. But, Wired magazine published a story about<br>
Simon called "Doomslayer." I think he was on the cover. Here's part of the<br>
article that tells the story of the 1st bet:<br>
<p>
---------------<br>
. . . The battle lines now drawn, it was not long before Ehrlich and Simon<br>
met for a duel in the sun. The face-off occurred in the pages of Social<br>
Science Quarterly, where Simon challenged Ehrlich to put his money where his<br>
mouth was. In response to Ehrlich's published claim that "If I were a<br>
gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year<br>
2000" - a proposition Simon regarded as too silly to bother with - Simon<br>
countered with "a public offer to stake US$10,000 ... on my belief that the<br>
cost of non-government-controlled raw materials (including grain and oil)<br>
will not rise in the long run." <br>
<p>
You could name your own terms: select any raw material you wanted - copper,<br>
tin, whatever - and select any date in the future, "any date more than a<br>
year away," and Simon would bet that the commodity's price on that date<br>
would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager. <br>
<p>
"How about it, doomsayers and catastrophists? First come, first served." <br>
<p>
In California, Paul Ehrlich stepped right up - and why not? He'd been<br>
repeating the Malthusian argument for years; he was sure that things were<br>
running out, that resources were getting scarcer - "nearing depletion," as<br>
he'd said - and therefore would have to become more expensive. A public<br>
wager would be the chance to demonstrate the shrewdness of his forecasts,<br>
draw attention to the catastrophic state of the world situation, and, not<br>
least, force this Julian Simon character to eat his<br>
words. So he jumped at the chance: "I and my colleagues, John P. Holdren<br>
(University of California, Berkeley) and John Harte (Lawrence Berkeley<br>
Laboratory), jointly accept Simon's astonishing offer before other greedy<br>
people jump in." <br>
<p>
Ehrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would<br>
undergo big price rises: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Then,<br>
on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using<br>
the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September 29,<br>
1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices<br>
of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the<br>
combined difference; if the prices fell, Ehrlich et alia would pay Simon. <br>
<p>
Then they sat back and waited.<br>
<p>
Between 1980 and 1990, the world's population grew by more than 800 million,<br>
the largest increase in one decade in all of history. But by September 1990,<br>
without a single exception, the price of each of Ehrlich's selected metals<br>
had fallen, and in some cases had dropped through the floor. Chrome, which<br>
had sold for $3.90 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.70 in 1990. Tin, which<br>
was $8.72 a pound in 1980, was down to $3.88 a decade later.<br>
<p>
Which is how it came to pass that in October 1990, Paul Ehrlich mailed<br>
Julian Simon a check for $576.07 . . . .<br>
