This so interesting to me because I spoke with Michael Ventura a few years<br>
ago about transhumans.  I was pitching a story for him to write the the LA<br>
Weekly.  We had an forthright conversation about the future but when it was<br>
all said and done, he said he had no interest in the future from an<br>
optimistic vantage.  He chose to write from the belly of the beast.<br>
