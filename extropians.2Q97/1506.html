<i>&gt; I quite agree regarding the value of critical thinking skills.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; note that logic is only the first of such skills to learn.  Next is</i><br>
<i>&gt; statistics (esp. Bayesian stat.).  And then game theory.  And you</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't really have good critical skills without learning the equivalent</i><br>
<i>&gt; of an intro course in 20 major subjects.</i><br>
<p>
Children today aren't even taught the basics to enable them to learn<br>
such things--first things first.  For example, there is a progression<br>
of decision-making disciplines.  The first is microeconomics: only the<br>
actions of one are considered, complete knowledge of choices and their<br>
resulting payoffs is assumed.  Then macroecomics: more than one actor,<br>
complete information.  Then decision theory (such as Bayesian analysis)<br>
where there is one actor, but incomplete information.  Finally, game<br>
theory with multiple actors and incomplete information.  Orthogonal<br>
to those are basic skills like epistemology, mathematics, language<br>
(and not just the ability to speak one--I mean really understanding<br>
what language is about and speaking at least two, plus signing).<br>
But all of these are just advanced studies based on the same logic.<br>
<p>
If one has a firm grasp of the most vital knowledge--language,<br>
epistemology, mathematics, basic biology, and moral direction--<br>
all the rest falls into place easily.  Why should a 4-year-old not<br>
be able to understand something as simple as supply and demand?<br>
Why should a first-grader not be able to spot a "post hoc" fallacy<br>
or argument from authority?  A 9-year-old should be able to point<br>
out an ambiguity or hidden implication in a sentence, or tell a<br>
correlation from causation.<br>
<p>
That so many adults are incapable of these simple things is all<br>
the more disastrous.  I'm all for those of us who have already<br>
mastered the basics to move on into game theory and politics; but<br>
let's get the rest of the world at walkin before we lament that<br>
they cannot run.<br>
