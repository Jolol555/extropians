The question whether one should or should not invest in nano<br>
startups has recently come up. Since I lack any information on<br>
specific startups (I would be very thankful if any insider could<br>
reveal some details on any of them, as there seem to be at least<br>
two {{I haven't managed to visit their web site yet}}) and have<br>
no financial expertise whatsoever, nor yet significant means to<br>
invest, I'd like to offer some tentative thoughts on the status<br>
quo, and a possible future developments in molecular<br>
manufacturing (whether vanilla or maracuja) instead.<br>
<p>
First of all I'd like to point out the fact that Drexler's brand<br>
of molecular manufacturing is not an absolute prerequisite for a<br>
transhumanist future, though it would certainly come more than<br>
handy. (Expect me to dance through streets, while drinking<br>
expensive liquour, throwing (for no particular reason, allow to<br>
me to introduce the charming neologism "bazooka barfing",<br>
relatively recently invented on the infamous pigdog list)<br>
confetti and hollering "Vivat Drexler!" at the top of my voice<br>
the day a rigorous study will show that nanoagent<br>
autoreplication by means of mechanosynthesis (aka machine-phase<br>
chemistry) is indeed feasible &lt;a long, hard knock on wood&gt;). The<br>
only really big minus to this is apparent impossibility of<br>
gradual, nondiscontinuous uploading, or nanoresurrection<br>
(verbatim re-incarnation) of corpsicles, nee cryosuspended<br>
patients. Personally, I think believing into nanoresurrection in<br>
the flesh to be quite silly, since both overestimating<br>
operational constraints drextech is subject to, and furthermore<br>
assuming an profoundly anthropocentric view of the future. The<br>
desuspended ones might be in for quite a shock, far beyond of<br>
what Alcor's mildly futuristic O'Neill space colonies featuring<br>
brochure has to offer.<br>
<p>
The discussions on this and several other lists had led to the<br>
following alternative future scenarios so far (please point out<br>
these I failed to mention):<br>
<p>
1) The &gt;Web, a near-future noosphere matrix which leads<br>
   to a technological Singularity, or even Transcension<br>
   (surely, these two have earned their CAPS initials)<br>
   by technologies unimaginable to us-current. This is<br>
   the most conservative route, since involving merely<br>
   enhanced cooperation of human and nonhuman agents<br>
   and intelligence augmentation by means of delegation<br>
   of duties (bureaucracy++) to extracorporal gadgets and<br>
   agentry, operated by radical GUIs (HMDs, speech and<br>
   optical input, Brain-Actuated Control (BAC) and trivial<br>
   neuro emplants for virtual motorics).<br>
<p>
2) Creation and inexpensive duplication of infoprocessing<br>
   systems of human equivalent or better, resulting in a<br>
   progressive enhanced design runaway. Brittle, inference<br>
   engine - typed AI has shown to be useful enough to be<br>
   commercially feasible, yet is falling remarkably far of<br>
   these goals. GA-driven connectionist paradigm, and a<br>
   dedicated nonalgorithmic hardware (EHW) seem to make<br>
   up a much more explosive brew. The &gt;H ALife Golem rears<br>
   its multidimensional, fractally rendered posthumanist head.<br>
<p>
3) Space-located (macroscopic) autoreplicators (initially<br>
   designed and deployed for extraterrestrial industry<br>
   purposes) subjected to darwinian fitness pressure will<br>
   evolve into artificial life forms, deep space and high<br>
   luminance/hard vacuum being their natural habitat, letting<br>
   their meek engineered origins far behind (even forgetting us,<br>
   though future machines should be able of being sentimental).<br>
<p>
The points 2) and 3) are best termed the "Mind Children"<br>
scenario.<br>
<p>
The turmoils accompanying above possible phase transitions might<br>
be considerable, involving even destruction of all life on earth<br>
(uneasily, one ponders diverse Great Filters, GRBs, and<br>
whatnots), whether as the result of a military conflict, or the<br>
equivalent of industrial or research accidents. (You see,<br>
obviously my European origins demand their toll, requiring at<br>
least a single dark apocalyptic stone in the otherwise uniformly<br>
gaudy whirl of the transhumanist mosaic).<br>
<p>
Probabilistically, the participants of this list are unlikely to<br>
effect measurable impacts upon these future developments. Even<br>
worse, I still think careful mentation, idea gestation and<br>
long-winded, good-humoured mutual bickering on diverse mailing<br>
lists and (goodheavensforbid) usenet newsgroups are essentially<br>
incompatible with accomplishing any of these things we so like<br>
to talk about. (We the cheerleaders, not the sweating crew out<br>
in the field. I'd be delighted to be proven wrong, though.<br>
Anyway, even spectator status has got its intrinsic benefits).<br>
<p>
Apart from having a good time, and a faint chance of actually<br>
contributing to the global transhumanist memefection conspiracy<br>
(tee-hee), my strictly personal life heuristic is thus to<br>
maneuvre oneself into a position of surviving the transition<br>
imminent (it'd better), possibly even profiting by it. Somehow I<br>
surmise am not alone in this ;)<br>
<p>
But back to nano (though this is by now sure facultative, being<br>
a rant (as if nobody already noticed)). Prior to Drexler, I<br>
guess even before R. Feynman's famed table talk "There is plenty<br>
of room at the bottom" (funny, remember SciAm's faux pas of<br>
using "Cargo Cult Science", Feynman's term for pseudoscientfic<br>
gobbledygook in their more than slightly dimwit Drexler<br>
critique, a course they by now have retracted, due to one single<br>
NASA Ames publication) there was already much mentation about<br>
methods for building artificial molecular-scale objects. I seem<br>
to recall reading several papers from start to mid-80's during<br>
my high school time. I also remember leafing through an<br>
assistant professor's (who has spent some of his time in St.<br>
Anford) "Nanosystems" preprint, which we at that time both found<br>
quite ridiculous. After having bought "Nanosystems" and reread<br>
it severeal times I now tend it to be much less laughable (this<br>
probably being attributed to me being out of the academy for<br>
sufficient time to lose all remaining scientific perspective<br>
traces).<br>
<p>
Drexler's "Nanosystems" is a pretty unpalatable piece of<br>
literature even for an interdisciplinary reader. Constructive<br>
engineering approach applied to molecular-scaled machines of<br>
complexity far transcending anything the art of molecular<br>
synthesis may ever accomplish and what computational chemists<br>
may ever hope to model is a hard thing to swallow.<br>
<p>
We are in a curious position today: the inexpensive computing<br>
power currently available to us has far outstripped our<br>
capability to do useful things with them. Quite obviously we<br>
haven't been able to keep up with the way our tools have grown.<br>
Our tools are not sufficiently autonomous and smart yet to aid<br>
us in their use. The year this changes will make us stumble a<br>
yet another major step up to the Singularity.<br>
<p>
The average chemist uses his computer to write papers, do his<br>
mail, and to process spectra. Period. The awareness for the<br>
gargantuan potential slumbering in computational chemistry seems<br>
simply to be nonexistant in most faculties. I remeber once<br>
shaking my head incredulously at the reactions of the<br>
(grey-haired) academic staff at my old alma mater, when a vacant<br>
professor slot had to be filled, several years ago. A guy with a<br>
very good reputation (at least I have heard of him) came up,<br>
made a firework display of sophisticated concepts (GA synthetic<br>
route planning, combinatorial chemistry, modeling, and whatnot)<br>
and even made a whopping hands-on demo on an SGI workstation<br>
hooked to a beamer (he brought the machine, the beamer was<br>
hitherto regarded as just a piece of expensive furniture). I<br>
mean this guy was really hot, he was actually doing things I<br>
merely used to dream about at the time.<br>
<p>
What happened? The profs stood up to fire their verbal torpedoes<br>
at him (to sink him, they thought). Instead, they demonstrated<br>
their very profound ignorance. They had only understood about<br>
10% of his lecture, and were even clueless about the future<br>
potential of those 10%. This was conservativism running rampant,<br>
an aged alphas' throng joined last stand. I still get upset when<br>
I think of that day.<br>
<p>
Outside the academy, the demand for computational chemistry<br>
comes from basically two fields: material science, and pharma.<br>
As antisense and receptor docking medicaments have arrived in<br>
the arsenal of modern iatro, and pharma is a big growt business,<br>
since the age histogram of industrialized countries is getting<br>
progressively skewed towards higher age.<br>
<p>
There are several companies writing computer chemistry codes,<br>
both quantum and classical level. Since handling this software<br>
is not trivial, and assumes quite a background in classical<br>
chemistry, I'd think consulting in such regions could bring in<br>
quite a wad of cash. As now supercomputer-class machines made<br>
from off-shelf consumer components (Beowulf and SHARC-based<br>
desktop supercomputers {{I have found out there are several of<br>
them, but the companies making them apparently expect customers<br>
to pay a lot for added value -- btw newest SHARC with 1 MBit<br>
on-die core, six links 120 MFlops peak, about 80 MFlops<br>
sustainable sells for $55 in OEM quantities, and<br>
indepedant benchmarks of TI's TMX320C6201 seem to indicate it<br>
really to be almost one order of magnitude better than<br>
SHARCs, though I still find its lack of links quite appaling}})<br>
are available, a nano startup could use proprietary code,<br>
running on in-house brewed hardware, whether Beowulf- or DSP<br>
box flavoured, and thus skim off a larger percentile of the<br>
cream.<br>
<p>
Any startup setting out to build Drexler's assemblers as their<br>
primarily, and sole goal is going to be broke surprisingly soon.<br>
<p>
But if this company starts doing business in normal modeling<br>
consulting, slowly building up competence and resources to<br>
embark on bootstrap projects towards molecular manufacturing,<br>
this company might be a quite good investment. (The best<br>
investment would be obviously to start up just such a company).<br>
