Looking into the future as a follow up to Mark's interesting point, which is<br>
also discussed in Wired October 1994 issue, how and through what medium would<br>
the Extropians go about uploading our human brains to say a Web site on the<br>
Internet-- in mere bit/byte PET Scans mappings, or actual cryonic DNA through<br>
molecular computing or nanotechnology as some Extropians propose?<br>
<p>
For sake of argument, if Mark is corrrect that "...consciousness is a state<br>
in the machine; an emergent property of the network...", and assuming that<br>
every Internet user uploaded their brain's DNA, would that result in a<br>
"Collective Extrophic Consciousness" or "Collective cyber/molecular brain<br>
mass"  as such, beyond our mere brains per se?  <br>
<p>
Or, is it possible that our "Collective Consciousness" is beyond something<br>
material and genetic-- the spiritual, the eternal, yes the soul--<br>
apocryphally speaking?  Would that mean there may be the after-life beyond<br>
this physical world?<br>
