Our culture values family cohesion (often so much that some families break<br>
down due to the pressure to be happy), and if there is any area where<br>
people are conservative, it is family roles. My own associations to the<br>
word 'uncle' suggests a friendly older mentor to the child, and I think<br>
this is quite close to what most people associate with avuncularity.  So<br>
when you become uncle, many people expect you to conform to this role;  by<br>
not doing so you upset their basic assumptions about family, which in<br>
turn causes a reaction. <br>
<p>
I really don't know how one *ought* to behave in this kind of situation. <br>
There is nothing wrong with not feeling (I know that this view is rare in<br>
our currently emotion-promoting society), just as there is no reason to<br>
avoid feeling anything; it is a personal decision what/if to feel. Of<br>
course, it might be an useful strategy to play along to put others at<br>
ease, but this is also an individual decision. <br>
<p>
Personally I hope my brother has a child, I really look forward to play<br>
uncle and give the child extropian ideas from the start... ;-)<br>
