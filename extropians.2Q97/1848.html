I just looked through Volume 8, Number 3 (the September Issue; I like<br>
accelerated publication). The site is<br>
<a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/3/99/bin/toc/na08003/">http://www.iop.org/EJ/3/99/bin/toc/na08003/</a> (unfortunately only for<br>
paying customers). If you can access it, the mpeg animations from the<br>
first and last article mentioned below are very fun.<br>
<p>
Some fun stuff: the NASA article about molecular gears (Molecular<br>
dynamics simulations of carbon nanotube-based gears, by Jie Han, Al<br>
Globus, Richard Jaffe and Glenn Deardorff), which suggests that<br>
nanogears will work up to 600-1000 K and rotation rates less than 100<br>
GHz. Sounds good to me, although the animations looked a bit rubbery. <br>
<p>
"On the importance of quantum mechanics for nanotechnology" by Noid,<br>
Tuzun and Sumpter was a bit more worrying, they claim that classical<br>
molecular dynamical studies of nanosystems may give inaccurate<br>
answers, and that quantum simulations may be needed (they propose<br>
their ICQMC model to deal with this). I'm not sure about how powerful<br>
their critique is, but they seem to suggest that some qualitative<br>
results may not hold due to quantum effects; low frequency modes may<br>
be more troubling than previously thought. <br>
<p>
Finally, "Dynamics of He/C60 flow inside carbon nanotubes" by Tuzun,<br>
Noid, Sumpter and Merkle has some fun simulations of fullerenes<br>
carried through nanotubes using helium. Seems the tubes can work as<br>
pipes too. <br>
