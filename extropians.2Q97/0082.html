The computer without instruction and the human without emotion produce the<br>
same output, nothing.<br>
<p>
	Have you known of any humans without emotions?<br>
<p>
 How these emotions come to us, unbidden, is still not fully explained by<br>
cognitive science- <br>
<p>
	Wasn't there a recent study which showed the steps of emotions?   Did it<br>
not show that first there is an incident, cognition of the incident,<br>
physical response to the incident, release of various chemicals based on<br>
the physical response and finally the "feeling" of the corresponding<br>
emotion?  Do not many actors experience this by copying the physical<br>
response for a particular emotion?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The need for emotions, as I see it, arises in primitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; systems that are unable to figure out causes and effects</i><br>
<i>&gt; and plan their actions intelligently.</i><br>
<p>
Has it been established that we "need" emotions?<br>
