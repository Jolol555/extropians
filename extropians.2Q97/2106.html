 This is an issue I don't feel we talk about enough, we spend alot<br>
of time talking about the cost of suspension, but little or none<br>
about the cost of revival.<br>
<p>
 It would seem we are talking about either a new financial<br>
instrument, or serious modifications of existing ones, there may be<br>
laws that need changing....<br>
<p>
 In Bruce Sterlings transhumanist novel "Holy Fire" the heroine<br>
pays for her life extension process by signing over 95% of her<br>
considerable assets, earned after a lifetime of conservative<br>
investing, frugal living, and compound interest, "even inanimate<br>
objects can get rich that way."<br>
<p>
Things we need to talk about......<br>
