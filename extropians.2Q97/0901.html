This discussion does not belong on the Extropians mailing list. If Erik and<br>
others want to argue about whether free markets or state control are best<br>
for poor children, take it to the Transhuman list, or some other place.<br>
<p>
The list rules are very clear about this. Eric broke the rules. I ask<br>
others not to respond to his posts on this topic here. Let's keep this list<br>
for its intended purpose.<br>
<p>
Erik, your comment about religious cults was asinine and uncalled for. Do<br>
you publish articles on totally irrelevant topics in Homo Excelsior? Would<br>
you publish an article comparing two makes of automobile, or a how-to guide<br>
on brick-laying? Didn't think. So please respect the founding principles of<br>
our list. Extropians love to debate economic issues, but this list is not<br>
the place for this discussion.<br>
