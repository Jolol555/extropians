I am being interviewed for a business magazine about where the Internet is<br>
going - and what we expect to see around 2010 and beyond.  The audience is<br>
more business orientated than necessarily technical.  The angle I am taking<br>
is one of a free-fall imagination of undaunted possibilities for<br>
transhumans.  This is good because the magazine is interested in innovative<br>
possibilities.<br>
<p>
Any points you might think are especially fascinating and surprising would<br>
be helpful.  I don't want to miss anything that you all might think is<br>
important, so please participate.<br>
<p>
Thank you and I look forward to your comments.<br>
