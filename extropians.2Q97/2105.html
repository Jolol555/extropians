<i>&gt;Any computer professional has heard of Moore's Law, first formulated by one</i><br>

<p>
Moore's law is a rule of thumb, not a law of nature.  There have been other<br>
periods of exponential growth in technological capacity, and they all came<br>
to an end, usually without anyone realizing in advance that they were about<br>
to.  <br>

Commercial air transport improved from 1903 to 1970 at an exponential clip,<br>
and has made essentially no progress since.  Nobody had any idea in 1970<br>
that progress was over.  If we were still on that curve, we'd have<br>
commercial trips to the moon.  The movie '2001' was a plausible<br>
extrapolation at the time.<br>
<p>
What makes me confident that AI-level processing power is possible is that<br>
(a) nature does it, and (b) Drexler has provided a carefully-worked analysis<br>
of how it could be built.  The timing could be either faster or slower than<br>
Moore's law suggests.  I would not be terribly surprised if economically<br>
feasible semiconductor technology were to bog down after one or two more<br>
chip generations.  The maximum speed of a Pentium might be 500 MHz for<br>
decades, until someone develops a breakthrough technology.  <br>

PS. You know, I seem to be the gloomy gus on this list, always pointing out<br>
problems with other people's posts and carping about limits.  In any other<br>
group, I come across as a raving technological optimist. <br>
