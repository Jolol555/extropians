You vote only for a platform and a person. Once elected, that person is<br>
free to implement their platform any way they like. Indeed, they can do<br>
the opposite of what they say they would. You have little power over who<br>
gets elected. You have no power over how they actually govern. To say<br>
your vote counts would be a gross overstatement.<br>

<p>
The most meaningful thing you can do with your vote is not to use it.<br>
You are making a statement, "I refuse to even consider the options you<br>
have given me. They are all equally worthless."<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Never vote, it only encourages them. <br>
