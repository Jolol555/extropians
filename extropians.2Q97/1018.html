<i>&gt; From: phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu (The Low Golden Willow)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt;Nope, u can get more protein from beans than from meat.  Vegan diet gives</i><br>
<i>&gt; } &gt;you so much nutrition its crazy.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; If this was the case then why did we start eating meat in the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; place?  If because it tastes good, *why* do we think meat tastes good?</i><br>
<p>
Of course it isn't true. We evolved in an environment in which food<br>
was scarce and most humans were undernourished. Our ancestors ate meat<br>
whenever they could get their hands on it (which was rare) because<br>
they ate *any* food they could get their hands on. Meat is pretty good<br>
if you are hungry -- its a very concentrated source of nutrients. Even<br>
for people as recently as a century ago in our own culture, meat was<br>
not an everyday thing to find on one's plate.<br>
<p>
However, we no longer are living in conditions where food is scarce<br>
and any source of nutrition we can find is to be jumped at. We suffer,<br>
if anything, from overnutrition in our country, with obesity being a<br>
serious cultural concern. We evolved to be able to take advantage of<br>
meat on the rare occassions it was presented to us, but now find<br>
ourselves in conditions where we can eat it every day at every meal if<br>
we so choose. We also evolved, I will point out, with bodies that were<br>
expecting diets that were, for the most part, high in fiber and low in<br>
concentrated protein and fat.<br>
<p>
We have thus started to gain all sorts of health problems from eating<br>
a diet we didn't evolve for. We love getting protein because our<br>
ancestors couldn't get enough -- but we get so much more than we need<br>
that it aids and abets osteoporosis. We leap at the chance to consume<br>
fatty foods, given brains programmed to try to get every calorie they<br>
can -- but our bodies aren't tuned for consuming high levels of fat<br>
every day, and although they do a heroic job coping with it, we end up<br>
with heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses as a result. Our<br>
digestive tracts are happy dealing with meat occassionally -- but<br>
forced to cope with low residue foods every day, our long intestinal<br>
tracts, not evolved for such a diet, end up developing unpleasant<br>
problems up to and including colon cancer.<br>
<p>
People often ask me "so, if you feel that its okay to eat meat<br>
occassionally and just not every day, why are you such a strict<br>
vegetarian?"<br>
<p>
Well, for me, it just simpler to live by a simple rule. This way, I<br>
don't have to try to keep track of how much meat I'm consuming or when<br>
or figure out whether I'm overdoing it, etc. I needn't calorie count,<br>
fat track, or otherwise check over what I'm eating -- I just follow<br>
some simple rules and I'm fine. Given that I know myself well enough<br>
to know that I couldn't obsessively track my dietary intake, this is a<br>
win for me.<br>
<p>
I recommend vegan diets largely because they prevent having to deal<br>
with issues of tracking consumption, but for those people who feel<br>
comfortable logging everything they eat, I certainly do not think<br>
there is anything wrong with it -- it just isn't for me.<br>
