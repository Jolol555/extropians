<p>
Adding new skills and memories would be nontrivial even if we could<br>
modify the neurons of the brain at will. Memories are stored in a<br>
distributed fashion, most likely as the synaptic strengths of widely<br>
interconnected neural networks in the cortex. This means that the<br>
memories of practicing and playing the piano are very hard to<br>
untangle from (say) the memories of the piano teacher, childhood<br>
memories, the experience of first using a computer and a lot of other<br>
stuff. <br>
<p>
Moving a skill from one brain to another is equivalent to, but likely<br>
many orders of magnitude harder, translating a book from one language<br>
to another, where many words are completely lacking or have different<br>
meanings. You don't have the same neurons as I do, and the<br>
microstructure of our brains differ quite a bit. Even the<br>
macrostructure is noticeably different in identical twins! Finding<br>
the "right" neural nets to modify in skill or memory transfer is<br>
hence very, very hard. It is likely easier to do some "compressed<br>
training" in the upload brain, where an external (possibly AI) system<br>
trains, monitors and modifies the brain during training, possibly<br>
even running the trainee in paralell and merging the results.<br>
<p>
What we will need to truly be able to transfer skills, memories and<br>
experience is some kind of "neural lingua franca"; maybe add-on lobes<br>
of our uploaded brains which are identical in all people and<br>
information inside them hence can easily be transferred. <br>
