That's the Copenhagen interpretation, it's pretty much consistent with <br>
observation but certainly not the only interpretation that is. In the 30's <br>
and 40's it was the only game in town, it has lost a lot of steam since then <br>
but it's still a leading contender. When the change happened is debatable, <br>
but In any interpretation something I did changed a photon 10 billion light <br>
years away and whatever transferred this change contained neither energy nor <br>
information and must have moved faster than light. <br>

True. What Einstein tells us is that event A could happen before event B in <br>
one frame of reference and event B could happen before event A in another <br>
frame  of reference and both viewpoints are equally valid. He also tells us <br>
that the space-time distance between any two events is exactly the same in <br>
any frame of reference. In my example I used the viewpoint that my experiment <br>
changed my friend's experiment 2 billion light years away, and it was a <br>
perfectly valid viewpoint. Equally valid would be the idea that my friend's <br>
experiment changed my experiment 2 billion light years away.<br>

Very True.<br>
