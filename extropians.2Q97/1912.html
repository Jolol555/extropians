     How interesting to see a seemingly harmless comment of mine mushroom <br>
     into a debate about who is and isn't artistically inclined, the <br>
     measure of contributions from the liberal arts as opposed to the <br>
     sciences.  Calm yourselves.  Turn down the ego potentiometers and <br>
     understand, without a need to defend, that your contributions are <br>
     viable, artistic, scientific, mathematic, literary ad infitum.  <br>
     <br>
     One of the most intriguing visions I ever had was a very, very <br>
     intricate line drawing, the likes of which would've confounded even <br>
     M.C. Escher I think (I was tripping...).  My mind, full of wonder, at <br>
     this very beautiful and extraordinarily intricate image wondered how <br>
     it could've been made.  I immediately zoomed in on the most <br>
     infinitessimal little lines of the much larger picture.  It became <br>
     what appeared to be a freeway viewed from the air with mathematical <br>
     equations relaying back and forth.<br>
     <br>
     I hope my point is clear.  Art and Science synergize continually.  It <br>
     is not a competition.  Though there are clearly different ways of <br>
     perceiving by the art-dominant or science-dominant mind, it is an <br>
     ongoing dance of the fanciful imagination supplying the seed for the <br>
     mineral-rich and grounded soil.  (like the metaphor?)<br>
     <br>
