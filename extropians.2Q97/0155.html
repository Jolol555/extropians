At 10:58 PM 4/7/97 +0200, a list member responded directly about my comment:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; (BTW, I don't write `sci-fi', and neither do Swanwick or Simmons.  We write</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; sf.)</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'm terribly sorry. Grave apologies, indeed, are due to those unjustly </i><br>
<i>&gt;slightened. No, nay, never will we ever utter that "SceeFee" obscenity in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the presence of our betters.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In utter exasperation</i><br>
<p>
I'll copy here to the list what I sent privately, in case others felt the<br>
same baffled exasperation:<br>
<p>
Calm down.  The distinction is not as foppish or gratuitous as you seem to<br>
think.  Here's a rather over-excited statement of why, nabbed without<br>
permission (but I hope he won't mind) from Harlan Ellison's Web fan page.<br>
Harlan was asked to write a piece for *Newsweek* on the Heaven's Gate<br>
suicides. `for the week ending April 5th, 1997.  The piece was requested by<br>
Newsweek to examine the link between the Heaven's Gate cult's mass suicide<br>
and science fiction'.  It eventually appeared in massively revised form.<br>
The original version had this to say, inter alia:<br>
<p>
`Try this for an answer: *nothing*.<br>
<p>
`They had *everything* to do with that hideous verbal <br>
crotchet "sci-fi," however.  And they are light-years apart, so <br>
don't confuse them.  At peril of your life.'<br>
<p>
Harlan added further on:<br>
<p>
`The concepts that abound in fantastical literature have the<br>
magical capacity to inspire dreams that become enriching reality.<br>
Science fiction, like The Whole Earth Catalog, is only<br>
an implement, a tool of the mind's imagination.  It employs the<br>
technique called extrapolation, allowing us to play the game of<br>
*what-if?*.  A game of intellect and daring, of special<br>
dreaming and determination not to buy into all those boneheaded<br>
beliefs that always tell use we're too stupid and too inadequate<br>
to prevail.  That we need some kind of mythical alien or<br>
supernatural babysitter to get us over the rough spots.  Science<br>
fiction says otherwise... <br>
<p>
`"Sci-fi," that hunchbacked, gimlet-eyed, slobbering village<br>
idiot of a bastardized genre, says only that logic is beyond us,<br>
understanding must be crushed underfoot, that the woods are full<br>
of monsters and aliens and conspiracies and dread and childish fear<br>
of the dark...<br>
<p>
`And *that* is the dichotomy of science fiction, as opposed <br>
to the tabloid mentality of UFO abductions, triangular-headed ETs,<br>
reinterpreted biblical apocrypha, and just plain bone stick stone<br>
gullibility.  It is obscurantism and illiteracy, raised to the level<br>
of dogma.  It requires that you be as ignorant today as you were<br>
yesterday, that you be no brighter than the sap who keeps playing<br>
three-card monte on a street corner with a hustler who will<br>
*never* cut you a break.<br>
<p>
`"Sci-fi" is what the Rancho Santa Fe sleepers bought, in that<br>
flashy but adolescent shell-game called *Waitin' for the UFO*.<br>
<p>
Given that this is the accepted and long-standing usage among practitioners<br>
of sf, can you see why we resent having the alternative thrust upon us?  If<br>
you doubt the significance of such verbal dichotomies, try the<br>
time-honoured method of approaching a large [----] and calling him a<br>
[`-----'].  (Enter target and epithet of choice)<br>
