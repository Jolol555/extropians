Mike et al:<br>
<p>
RM is a unified, extensible physical theory.<br>
<p>
It's based on a matter-forces-empty spaces metaphysics.<br>
<p>
All energy in RM is either potential or inertial<br>
<p>
It's also the original foundation of Kantian philosophy, BTW.<br>
<p>
Which was also the classical foundation of Western liberalism, BTW.<br>
<p>
That is, Einstein and other Machian Positivists broke the Kantian <br>
foundations of modern Western civilization, and precipitated the horrors <br>
of the Twentieth Century.<br>
<p>
Cross-compare the chronologies.<br>
<p>
Mach was a psycho-physical parallelist, whereby we're machinery, with <br>
consciousness as a redundant and useless epiphenomenon.<br>
<p>
Einstein was a religious determinist -- he proposed a four-dimensional <br>
unchanging Parmenidean block universe.<br>
<p>
Good way to wipe out human qualities and liberties at the same time, eh?<br>
<p>
Marx and Engels were positivists, too.<br>
<p>
You get the picture?<br>
<p>
RM smashes their nonsense up irretrievably -- it completely demolishes it <br>
all, and Copenhage-school Quantum-Mysticism too.<br>
<p>
<p>
The bloody physicists -- as Heisenberg spotted -damn near wiped out humanity <br>
as well as liberty altogether.<br>
<p>
They also gave us fail-deadly nuclear-missile-equipped submarines, too.<br>
<p>
Premised on a bipolar world.<br>
<p>
Any third party could have precipitated a war which would have wiped out the <br>
planet.<br>
<p>
Ask yourself why the Pentagon frittered away ten times the cost of 'High <br>
Frontier' on next to nothing, except bureaucrats' salaries.<br>
<p>
One of Robert A. Heinlein's last writings was an Introduction to High <br>
Frontier's Second edition:  My First Edition is inscribed:<br>
<p>
To Tony Hollick, from Dan Graham.<br>
<p>
The second Edition has a cover picture of the Space Shuttle illuminated on <br>
the night time launch-pad.<br>
<p>
Exactly the same picture as the one on the birthday card on my mantel-piece <br>
the day Challenger exploded. Inside, my late mum had written:<br>
<p>
"Taking Off, I Hope!"<br>
<p>
Earlier that day, I had taken off my Omega Speedmaster chronograph, the <br>
official issue to all the Apollo Crews. I'd been hearing extraordinarily <br>
loud tape-recorded 'clicks' synchronous with my thinking, which could be <br>
tape-recorded and which were heard by other people in the room, who were <br>
startled by them too.  And on phone lines...<br>
<p>
I was testing a hypothesis related to hyperacuitive clueing and tacit <br>
predictive pattern analysis.<br>
<p>
(Methodologically unsoud, really: we all have exactly accurate 'internal <br>
atomick clocks').<br>
<p>
<p>
"Aha!"<br>
<p>
The replacement -- quartz -- watch I bought at the local ESSO station was on <br>
offer at UKP 1.99. The first one I bought was labelled 'DT'<br>
<p>
Didn't feel comfortable with it.<br>
<p>
Exchanged it for one labelled -- innocuously? -- OMAC<br>
<p>
The station manager chased after me to ask me why I'd exchaged it <br>
<p>
[ "FLASH!" ]<br>
<p>
MAC is (inter alia) Ailitary Assistance Command.<br>
<p>
All ask yourselfves what 'O' stands for...<br>
<p>
'O'-rings?<br>
<p>
Or Lawrence Livermore's 'O'-group?<br>
<p>
Now go rent Richard C. Sarafian's fine road movie 'Vanishing Point' [1971], <br>
one of my all-time favourite movies.  Kowalski sets out to drive an Alpine <br>
White supercharged Dodge Challenger from Denver to San Francisco.  On speed, in both <br>
senses... &gt;:-}<br>
<p>
<p>
Try to get the _uncut_ version. The one with a heroic ending.  If you can. <br>
<p>
There's a 'Vanishing Point' Web site now...<br>
