<i>&gt; &gt;As always, there's a bright side: all patents are public, so while</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you can't legally make profit from the patent, you can always build</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the device for your own use.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you build something covered by copyright, whether for yourself or</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone else, I suspect that you are still breaking copyright. </i><br>
<p>
A copyright cannot be applied to any material object, save things like<br>
buildings, sculptures, and other things, merely for their form as an<br>
object of art. TO be patented, something must have a demonstrated<br>
usefull function that is new and unique, or that performs the function<br>
in a new and unique way. By definition, art work has no functional<br>
utility aside from its form and thus cannot be patented. However a<br>
method of creating art that is new and unique CAN be patented. it is<br>
very important that you understand the differences between types of<br>
intellectual property like copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Each<br>
functions and is treated differently in a legal context.<br>
<p>
<p>
The idea of<br>
<i>&gt; copyright is to protect the financial rewards from a certain idea. If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; build it yourself rather than buy it you are taking away money from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; legal owner of the invention (of course the logic is twisted if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; copyright owner is just sitting on the patent, but I don't think this</i><br>
<i>&gt; changes anything legally).</i><br>
<p>
Once again, you are confusing copyrights and patents. However, any<br>
intellectual property can be recreated by an individual for individual<br>
use only. If the individual gains commercially in any way it is a<br>
violation of the creators property rights. THis is why software licenses<br>
allow business users of software who are the users of that copy more<br>
than 80% of the time to copy the software onto their personal computer<br>
at home. Exceptions to this are software that could only be used for<br>
business purposes, like marketing management software, business<br>
management software like Microsoft Profit, engineering software, etc.<br>
<p>
 Otherwise it would be OK for a group of people<br>
<i>&gt; with mutual interest to form, then make and distribute a copyrighted</i><br>
<i>&gt; invention in a non-profit manner. The size of the group could be same size</i><br>
<i>&gt; as the market for the original invention. Even if there is a loophole in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the law that allows this to happen I doubt that it would last very long</i><br>
<i>&gt; once it was exploited.</i><br>
<p>
Distribution to others is not allowed and does not fit into the context<br>
of "personal use". Law does not mandate that you make a profit to<br>
qualify as a commercial enterprise. If people are reimbursing you for<br>
the cost of reproduction, then they are helping to defray the initial<br>
cost to purchase the book, tape, disk, patent file, or painting. THis<br>
reimbursement is a recognised commerical gain. Every individual must<br>
purchase at least one piece of intellectual property, even just a copy<br>
of the patent file at the patent office. In the case of a patent, the<br>
person is not buying the actual product, but merely a relatively simple<br>
description of the product. It is still up to them to create engineering<br>
drawings, production drawings, tooling drawings, the production tooling,<br>
etc to build copys, and in that event can still only make as many as<br>
they can personally use.<br>
