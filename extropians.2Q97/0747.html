Here we go name-calling again.<br>
<p>
This calls to mind a corollary to Murphy's Laws that I read long ago,<br>
called something like Wilkinson's Razor:  "Never attribute to malice<br>
what is adequately explained by stupidity." (substitute "ignorance" if<br>
you like).  My own personal law goes like this:  "Whenever you think<br>
'Nobody could be that stupid!', you're wrong.".  I just thought of it;<br>
if you quote it, please to refer to it as "Watson's Law".  Perhaps I was<br>
inspired by watching an episode of "The World's Dumbest Criminals".  If<br>
you find that somebody's claimed it already, let me know and I'll credit<br>
them from now on.<br>
<p>
That aside, I'm not saying that the original claimant was stupid, though<br>
I think he's sorely mistaken, likely having missed some fallacy in the<br>
argument presented to him -- I use my laws mainly to remind me that<br>
there's no percentage in thinking that people do bad things on purpose.<br>
As Worf once said on ST:TNG, "A siege mentality is ultimately self-<br>
defeating." (my favorite quote of his, after perhaps "They roar -- and<br>
hurl heavy objects." -- but I digress).<br>
<p>
No sense beating on hundreds for believing in water-powered cars when<br>
there are still billions who believe in God.<br>
<p>
Nerds on their little nets agree... :-)<br>

Cheers,<br>
