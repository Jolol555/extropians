<i>&gt; Nanotechnology would be a good investment too.</i><br>
<p>
It looks to me like nanotech would be a bad investment at the present time<br>
(unless you use the term very broadly to include biotech and the like).<br>
I don't even know what companies you would count as a nanotech investment.<br>
But supposing you could find a startup somewhere that was claiming to<br>
do R&amp;D towards Drexlerian nanotech, with a payoff just a few years out,<br>
this would be a very questionable investment.<br>
<p>
The Idea Future (now called Foresight Exchange) market prediction of when<br>
nano-scale robot arms and circuitry will come into being is around the year<br>
2025 or so.  So maybe in 20 years it will be a good investment, but not now.<br>
<p>
John Walker of Autodesk, a successful CAD company, got interested in<br>
nanotech and other Drexlerian ideas back in the 1980's.  The company lost<br>
a bundle on Xanadu, the Drexler-influenced hypertext publishing project.<br>
(See Ed Regis' "Nano" for more on Drexler &amp; Xanadu.)  Eventually they<br>
had to retrench and focus on their core business instead of these blue<br>
sky ideas.<br>
<p>
Nanotech is a good example of an area where Extropians are vulnerable to<br>
being seduced by sexy sounding technology.  We have to remain skeptical and<br>
look at these ideas critically.  Nanotech has a lot of potential but it's<br>
not just around the corner.<br>
