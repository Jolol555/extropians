     "If you expect Extropian investments to be motivated by altruism, you<br>
     don't understand Extropianism very well."<br>
     <br>
     I could treat this statement as a "what's so" or as a personal <br>
     judgment but I'll opt for the former, reminding you that in my <br>
     original post, I was *asking* for understanding so, if the quote was a <br>
     censure, it was redundant.  <br>
     <br>
     I would expect no human concern to be completely altruistic.  We've <br>
     still got the survivalist trigger somewhere in our brain that keeps <br>
     narcissism at the forefront of our consciousness.  However, if <br>
     humanity were in a life raft adrift at sea, I'd hope that an Extropian <br>
     would be the person most adept at navigating, protecting from the <br>
     elements, and rationing the food and water.  S/he would be the leader <br>
     that would better assure the survival of the group because of a <br>
     natural tendency toward leadership, optimism and use of resources.  <br>
     <br>
     And yes, I think it's quite opportunistic to invest in something that <br>
     makes money for you and is not benefiting and could be harmful to <br>
     society.  I've drank gallons of it over my life probably, it goes <br>
     great with pizza.  Now, I consider it a treat.  But many people guzzle <br>
     it like water.  After the smoke has cleared and our society has agreed <br>
     upon the scourge of smoking and it becomes the habit of only the <br>
     weakest and feeble-minded, we will move our focus to the next and <br>
     probably more important level in collective health consciousness: junk <br>
     food.  There is a tie between what we eat as a culture and how we <br>
     behave.  Garbage in, garbage out.<br>
     <br>
     Right now, the soft drink companies (as well as the tobacco) companies <br>
     are establishing international markets with people who are delighted <br>
     to have their products but are totally oblivious to the consequences, <br>
     health wise and environment wise as well (can you imagine all of China <br>
     with Coke with dispensed ice in plastic/paper cups?)<br>
     <br>
     So, no, altruism need not be the primary goal of an Extropian way of <br>
     thinking but it certainly should be pressing on the minds of those <br>
     that are claiming a post human destiny and it should show up in their <br>
     lifestyle.  You don't evolve just one part of your existence, you <br>
     evolve the whole thing: mind, body and spirit.  If Extropians have no <br>
     concern of the latter, it's an incomplete and imbalanced philosophy <br>
     and I should continue my search for a more full-spectrumed approach to <br>
     conscious, biological and social evolution.<br>
     <br>
     Regards,<br>
