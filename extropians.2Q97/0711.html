<i>&gt; &gt;I am no geologist.  I am no economist.  To say we are running out of any</i><br>

<i>&gt; Julian Simon is an economist and I think one of his main points is that</i><br>
<i>&gt; throughout history scarcity itself has helped to preserve the Earth's</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural resources. As long as a resource is considered useful, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered valuable (and worthy) and it will have a price. The more scarce a</i><br>
<i>&gt; resource becomes, the higher the price will go.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As the price goes up, the number of buyers who think it is still worth the</i><br>
<i>&gt; price will go down. This has a similar effect as conservation, i.e., fewer</i><br>
<i>&gt; users of a resource.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Simon uses fossil fuel as an example. He says we will NEVER run out of oil.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Technically, he's probably right. As oil becomes scarce, the price rises. By</i><br>
<i>&gt; the time the price becomes cost-prohibitive, other useful alternatives or</i><br>
<i>&gt; substitutes will be invented or discovered. By the time we have very little</i><br>
<i>&gt; oil left, it will be so expensive that no one will want to buy it, so we</i><br>
<i>&gt; will never really run out.</i><br>
<p>
There is also the effect of increased prices on recovery cost<br>
effectiveness. WHenever you hear of someone saying there is only 30<br>
years worth of oil left, they mean that there is that much in reserves<br>
available that are cost effective enough to recover at today's market<br>
prices. Obviously there is plenty of oil that is too expensive to<br>
recover right now, but as demand rises and prices inflate, those other<br>
reserves become cost effective. This is one of the little lies that<br>
environmentalists and conservationists tell to get support, because they<br>
imply to the less intelligent people that there is ONLY 30 years worth<br>
of oil at ANY  price left. There is literally  a HUGE supply of oil in<br>
the ground, enough that it will be a few thousand years before we use it<br>
all up at a minimum.<br>
