It does occur for me that amongst the many contributors to this list,<br>
there is a preference for those things most proveable, tangible and<br>
material rather than anything etherial, supposed, or otherwise imagined.<br>
<p>
Personally I want to achieve a variety of tangible things; the only<br>
reliable way of doing that is to concentrate on the tangible, provable<br>
and material aspects of life. I've met zillions of people who dream<br>
about and talk about achieving many things, but few who actually do<br>
anything about it. The latter folks have a high success rate, the former<br>
almost zero.<br>
 <br>
Dear Fellow Extropians,<br>
Sometimes it's simply circumstances that determine the degree of<br>
supposed success.<br>
<p>
It may occur to some that both Rick and Mark are partially correct.<br>
<p>
Posibly, in the diversity of opinion and the variables of circumstances<br>
we are all attempting to achieve our lifes dreams. <br>
<p>
To what extent does our degree of success matter if it has no<br>
constructive effect on future generations?<br>
