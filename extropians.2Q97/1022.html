I think the food combining, even though nonsense, could have beneficial<br>
results.  If you follow it strictly, you automatically can't do a number of<br>
bad things that people trying to eat less and eat healthy sometimes do - no<br>
fried food in the morning, for example.  The need to follow the complicated<br>
regimen of food combining also protects from over- or mis-eating in social sit<br>
uations, which I find sometimes a real problem.  Fit for Life won't have<br>
results any different than any other vegetarian diet (you eat what you want<br>
of a large and varied set of choices), and the semi-religious food combining<br>
nonsense might help people follow it better.  Certainly it's better than a<br>
McDonald's diet.<br>
