<i>&gt;Subject: Re: Uploading (Who is Who?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We are talking about a technique that is not cloning but production of</i><br>
<i>&gt;human analogs, much like bringing your duplicate here from a parallel</i><br>
<i>&gt;universe. In the case of analogs, property rights as well as personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;responsibility are indeed shared. </i><br>
<p>
Says who, for what reason, on what authority and, in what jurisdiction?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Imagine someone killing someone then</i><br>
<i>&gt;making 10 duplicates of himself. </i><br>
<p>
Imagine duplicating a person you kill in a spacetime pattern they liked you.<br>
Do you think you will be charged with murder <br>
or making them forget you were a killer?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pleading guilty gets him 20 years, with</i><br>
<i>&gt;parole at 8 years, yet with shared responsibility, the 8 years are</i><br>
<i>&gt;divided among 10 analogs (plus the original, who may even into hiding)</i><br>
<i>&gt;so they each serve 9.6 months before getting out on good behavior. Since</i><br>
<i>&gt;they would be sentenced at the same time, they would most likely serve</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the same prison, and would hang together, so they wouldn't have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;worry about bending over for the soap.</i><br>
<p>
You are suggesting individual duplicates get shorter sentences <br>
for having someone quite similar to them.<br>
That is not reason.<br>
If a duplicate kills seconds after it is made, <br>
shall the one it is made from be punished <br>
when it's finger did not pull a trigger, no.<br>
Shall a duplicate whose fingers did not even exist in the mind <br>
of the one who would soon dream of creating them,<br>
suffer wrath for an event occurring before it was yet formed, no.<br>
What you suggest is a child should pay for a parent's sin.<br>
If you believe this <br>
the child may suffer for parents of it's parents and other ancestors <br>
who have not paid enough to satisfy your greed.<br>
This brings absurdity to my mind.<br>
<p>
My God people...<br>
what planet do you come from(!)?<br>
Can you not tell the difference between two things(!)?<br>
Two things are not the same thing, they are different;<br>
that is why they are two things!<br>
Is that so hard to know?<br>
Two dollars are not the same dollar.<br>
You may say they the have the same value to you <br>
but that is because you fail to see the differences.<br>
If you talk to a collector they will tell you <br>
there are many things which determine value <br>
(ie. #,extent, and type of flaws, rarity, and historical/senitmental value).<br>
Is it possible that people smart enough to be transhumans<br>
do not realize there is only one A and some thing else is B?<br>
Use some common sense, you're dissapointing me.<br>
<p>
I appoligize for resorting to exclamations.<br>
I hope I am forgiven.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;IF the individual is sufficiently wealthy, as long as they don't mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;diluting their wealth by the number of analogs produced, and can escape</i><br>
<i>&gt;wrongful death lawsuits, this would be a useful option.</i><br>
<p>
You people talk about law and refuse to aknowledge <br>
that it's validity is based upon the governments authority <br>
is supposed to be granted to it by the consent of the governed<br>
(so says the Declaration of Independence of the U.S.A.).<br>
If you do not want to pay rebel against tyranny and oppression.<br>
Free your self from ignorance.<br>
It makes me angry.<br>
