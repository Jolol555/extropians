Very true.  I just a few days ago grabbed some books on logic, a subject<br>
I've had only passing contact with in the past.  The very<br>
basics of rational thought, as far as I can tell now, are fairly simple to<br>
grasp, and provide a substantial leap forward in critical thinking skills.<br>
Considering this and the fact that rational thinking is so crucial, I'm<br>
floored by the fact that I'm 26 and having to go out of my way to learn<br>
it.  I can't believe my formal education thus far (high school, a BA,<br>
working on a BS) has not offered to explicitly teach me how to think.<br>
Note that I am human.  Failing to teach humans how to think clearly is<br>
like birds not teaching their young how to fly (I don't know if flying is<br>
learned, but you get the analogy).  My first semester organic<br>
chemistry instructor is the only teacher I've ever had who has strongly<br>
emphasized a thought process when approaching a problem. <br>
<p>
Bill Clinton wants to ensure every school kid has access to the Internet.  <br>
Never mind the fact that without rational thinking skills they'll never be able<br>
to distinguish noise from valuable information.  IMO, this is the most<br>
devestating failure of failure of American education.<br>
