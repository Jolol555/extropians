I'd like to echo Perry's comments.<br>
<p>
The most important point is: if you value your future, invest in it.<br>
<p>
Instead of having as much fun now spending your time and money on lots<br>
of fun stuff, save more of your money, and spend more of your time<br>
working, either for someone else, on ventures you think will pay off<br>
later, or learn marketable skills.<br>
<p>
On saving money, it is much less important how exactly you save/invest<br>
than how *much* you save/invest.  Index mutual funds avoid trading<br>
losses, and if you can avoid taxes, such as via IRAs, all the better.<br>
<p>
Avoid making bets with other people, and everything but buying an<br>
average such as an index *is* a bet.  One of you will lose the bet and<br>
the broker will take a cut.  Are you really sure they don't know<br>
something you don't?  (Raw bets are a great way to demonstrate<br>
confidence and to create a reliable consensus, but they can be a lousy<br>
investment.)<br>
<p>
When investing in personal skills and new ventures, rather than in<br>
financial markets, there is less market arbitrage and so a better<br>
chance that your new idea really is better.  But try to be honest with<br>
yourself about the degree to which you just enjoy this "investment"<br>
activity, vs. it really having a big chance of paying off well.<br>
Opening a new place to eat, or taking flying lessons, are mostly done<br>
for the fun of it.<br>
<p>
Lots of the Asian tigers have really high savings rates.  They may not<br>
know as much about the future as American engineers do, but they know<br>
that they care about it a lot.<br>
