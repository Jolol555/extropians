There are of course God believers who believe that scientific hypothesis<br>
are unsupported and do not appear to be falsifiable or possible to test in<br>
anyway - except within the self-created world of science.<br>
<p>
I don't believe in God or science. (Or anything, actually)<br>
<p>
Both work, and are useful, but that is all they are, useful constructions.<br>
<p>
Anyone who believes science (or God) is real, is just confusing the menu<br>
with the meal.<br>
<p>
Science isn't verifiable except within its own game. The same is true of<br>
God. You can't use one to prove or disprove the other - they have both<br>
been hermetically sealed for dogmatic freshness and self-preservation.<br>
<p>
We are all playing language games, we are all magicians.<br>

Enjoy...<br>
