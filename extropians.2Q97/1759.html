I was holding the book in my hands last year in a bookstore.  It was a <br>
guide to groups and organizations that purported to have the <br>
Generation X angle, and I saw Extropians listed in the index.  The entry <br>
read something like "a fringe cult based in Californa".  I'll drop by <br>
the bookstore sometime this week and see if I can find it again.<br>
<p>
WARNING, HUMOR.future scenario:  Max dies and his frozen head <br>
is enshrined at Alcor.  Two thousand years hence, he has been <br>
canonized as the founder of a religion with major economic and <br>
political holdings, and the priests who control it refuse to allow him <br>
to be revived.  "Best Do It So" has been corrupted into "Just Do It", and <br>
moral imperatives force everyone to wear black t-shirts and Nike shoes.  <br>
A small band of rebels known as the Excelsior League forms an underground <br>
resistance.  In an attempt to remove the symbolic power of Max's <br>
corpus, they into Alcor and takes a blowtorch to Max's chamber.  <br>
(Hmm, that didn't end well for Max, did it!)<br>
