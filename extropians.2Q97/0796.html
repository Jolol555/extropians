1) Pyramids, water cars, yogic levitation, etc.<br>
<p>
For those of you who would like to turn this list into the National<br>
Enquirer, and want to tell us all about how evil the supressors of<br>
Earth Shattering Technology are, just accept that we are a bunch of<br>
ignorant jerks, unsubscribe, and find another group happier to listen<br>
to you.<br>
<p>
2) Save the poor third world children, win valuable prizes!<br>
<p>
The thing that will help the poor worldwide far more than anything<br>
else is economic development, and the only thing we know of that<br>
actually causes economic development is free market capitalism. I<br>
would have thought this was more or less accepted here in the Rabid<br>
Heart of Extropian Thought.<br>
