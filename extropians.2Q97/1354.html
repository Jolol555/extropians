<i>&gt;It looks to me like nanotech would be a bad investment at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;present time (unless you use the term very broadly to include</i><br>
<i>&gt;biotech and the like).</i><br>
<p>
An excellent example of this was posted to this list a few weeks<br>

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 29, 1997--Nanogen Inc. Tuesday<br>
announced that it has been awarded a U.S. patent covering key areas<br>
of its Automated Programmable Electronic Matrix (APEX) Technology.<br>
<p>
U.S. Patent No. 5,605,662, titled ``Active Programmable <br>
Electronic Devices for Molecular Biological Analysis and<br>
Diagnostics,''is the third U.S. patent issued to the company within<br>
the past 10 months.<br>
          <br>
``This patent provides Nanogen with significant proprietary <br>
protection on our electronic microchip array technology,'' said <br>
Howard C. Birndorf, chairman and chief executive officer of<br>
Nanogen.<br>
<p>
 The patent, which expires on Feb. 25, 2017, was issued to <br>
co-inventors Michael J. Heller, Ph.D., chief technical officer and<br>
a co-founder of Nanogen, and Eugene Tu, research scientist.  Patent<br>
applications on this invention have also been filed<br>
internationally. All rights to the patents have been assigned to<br>
Nanogen.<br>
          <br>
``Our invention encompasses self-addressable microelectronic <br>
devices which can actively carry out and control multiplex<br>
reactions in microscopic formats,'' said Heller.<br>
          <br>
``We are actively developing a series of products embodying this <br>
technology which will have applicability in a variety of areas, <br>
including the early detection and diagnosis of disease, genetic <br>
screening, molecular oncology, blood typing and screening, and <br>
biological research, as well as a number of other potential <br>
applications,'' added Tu.<br>
<p>
 Nanogen is a privately held company focused on the development of <br>
a broad-based diagnostic platform, which combines molecular<br>
genetics, microelectronics, lasers and nanotechnology.  The company<br>
currently employs 60 people at its corporate headquarters in San<br>
Diego.<br>

<i>&gt;Nanotech is a good example of an area where Extropians are</i><br>
<i>&gt;vulnerable to being seduced by sexy sounding technology.  We have</i><br>
<i>&gt;to remain skeptical and look at these ideas critically.  Nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt;has a lot of potential but it's not just around the corner.</i><br>
<p>
I agree that any investment should be subjected to the cold harsh<br>
light of good capitalism, but we should use our own expertise and<br>
knowledge base to recognize "nuggets in the gravel."<br>
