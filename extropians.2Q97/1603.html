Again, you may be right, but this seems to be just speculation.  We<br>
don't know how long it took to reach your (reasonable) definition of<br>
domestication, nor how many individuals (both humans and others) were<br>
involved in the effort.  I understand that "scientific" breeding in<br>
modern farms has improved greatly over older intuitive breeding.  And<br>
it stands to reason that great further improvements will be possible<br>
when we can cheaply read out the entire genome of each individual in a<br>
breeding program, match them with detailed behavioral data, and<br>
even splice together desired trial genomes.<br>
