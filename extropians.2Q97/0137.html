Most people care more than you about what other people will respect in<br>
them and desire from them, but perhaps your children will be like you<br>
here.  Even so, you surely want your children to have realistic<br>
expectations about what sort of things are possible for them.  You<br>
don't want them to think they can fly by jumping off the roof and<br>
flapping their arms.  And if, for example, they announce their<br>
interest in being a movie star, princess, professional basketball<br>
player, or astronaut, you probably want to make it clear these are<br>
long shots.<br>
<p>
Similarly, you might want to give similar info to a son who would like<br>
to be a fulltime house-husband, or who is hoping he'll never have to<br>
deal with violence from bullies at school, or who is hoping to deal<br>
with his shyness by waiting for girls to ask him out socially.  While<br>
these may be realistic prospects for most girls, they are simply not<br>
for most boys.  <br>
