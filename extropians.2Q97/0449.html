Mike Rose:<br>
<i>&gt;I just find it sad that the only</i><br>
<i>&gt;incentive in today's world is money, and not pride, or fame, or the </i><br>
<i>&gt;pure thrill of success, or the feeling of achievement gained when you see</i><br>
<i>&gt;a private fantasy tuen into a reality.</i><br>
<p>
I think that more people than you realize are motivated by their own <br>
dreams.  Look at all of the individuals working very long hours in the <br>
jobs that offer rewards other than high salaries -- police, <br>
firefighters, aid workers, rescue workers, counselors, researchers, <br>
teachers, activists, astronomers, inventors, experimental scientists, <br>
nurses, philosophers, ministers, human rights workers, coaches, poets.  <br>
Not to mention the thousands of volunteers that give generously of their <br>
precious free time and energy to provide cheap labor for various causes.  <br>
Parents, who make huge sacrifices to raise their kids in the best way <br>
possible.  And, most importantly for this forum, systems <br>
administrators, like Julf, who have put their personal safety and <br>
careers on the line to maintain a free and open Internet.<br>
<p>
Sin,<br>
