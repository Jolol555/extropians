Hunter-gatherers could not cultivate any plants, so they had to find <br>
nourishing vegetables by gathering them. This means that beans and other <br>
high-nutrient vegetables could not be relied on for food, especially out <br>
of season. Humans are opportuntistic omnivores (like many other animals; <br>
sheep seem to enjoy eating eggs and young birds if they can find the <br>
nests) and use all available sources of nutrition, both plants and <br>
animals (hence our multi-purpose set of teeth). <br>
<p>
We like fat and sugars because they were rather scarce in the past - if <br>
you found them, eat them by all means, because you'll never know when <br>
you'll find more food. This is the reason most people love chocolate: <br>
fat, sugar, minerals and some psychoactive compunds at once. <br>
