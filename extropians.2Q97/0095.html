<i>&gt;  Check out this Mir Aimal Kansi </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  aka: Mir Aimal Kanci, Mir Aimal Kasi, Mohammed Alam Kasi, Mir Aman Qazi,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Mir Amial Qansi, Amial Khan </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Reward: $2 MILLION </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  THE CRIME: </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Mir Aimal Kansi is being sought in connection with the shooting of five</i><br>
<i>&gt;  individuals with an AK-47 assault rifle. The January 1993 shooting</i><br>
occurred<br>
<i>&gt;                               outside CIA Headquarters, Langley, Virginia,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and resulted in the killing of two individuals and the wounding of three</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
Here is some background on the killings.  <br>
The CIA agent who was killed in this shooting was a field agent who had been<br>
operating in the town from which Mir came.  No connection had been<br>
established, last I had heard, between these two persons.  However, the<br>
assumption was that it was a "hit" that had been carefully planned for some<br>
time.  Mir, by the way, had traveled from the Middle East to the US for no<br>
apparent reason other than this killing.<br>
Also, if memory serves me correctly, Mir had purchased an AR-15 and had<br>
intended to use that instead.  After a couple of days, he attempted to return<br>
the rifle to the gunstore, but was not permitted to get a refund.  Instead,<br>
he exchanged for the AK-47, a firearm with which he was more familiar, at a<br>
loss of several hundred dollars.<br>
If the CIA knows why its man was "hit", no one has reported--at least not in<br>
a declassified text.  That leaves the background of the entire affair to<br>
speculation.<br>
<p>
"Infidel, do not cast your gaze upon my sister!  Allah, give me the strength<br>
to retaliate!"<br>
