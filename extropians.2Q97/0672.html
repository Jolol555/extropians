Patrick Wilken asked about the most recent wager between Paul Ehrlich <br>
and Julian Simon:<br>
&lt;The story told in the documentary what that Ehrlich's group was <br>
basically only allowed to chose metals - no other commodities were <br>
allowed. [SNIP] They did mentioned that much more recently there has <br>
been a second challenge by Ehrlich to Simon, but that Simon had not <br>
taken up the bet. Does anyone know what's become of this second bet? <br>
And what the true story of the first bet is?&gt;<br>
<p>
Just this past week, Simon wrote a commentary on this in the Wall <br>
Street Journal.  Ehrlich and company lost the first bet and paid up. <br>
 As for the second bet, Simon said they could pick any measure(s) of <br>
growth they liked and he would bet that over a period of ten years or <br>
more the measure would increase.<br>
<p>
I'm not sure I remember all the details, but apparently Ehrlich wanted <br>
to use something like the amount of ozone in the atmosphere as a <br>
measure of progress and Simon said, no, it would have to be some <br>
measure of economic growth.  So now, according to Simon, Ehrlich is <br>
running around saying that Simon will no longer risk betting on <br>
progress in the future.<br>
