Hi!<br>
<p>
I have employment opportunities available in a brand new Silicon Valley<br>
startup company.  Since I would rather work with Extropians than your<br>
average person off the street, I am offering these opportunities here first.<br>
<p>
NOTE:<br>
I am willing to judge everyone on the merit of their skills, and not<br>
exclusively on their experience i.e. if you are a closet Java hacker who<br>
works as a grocery clerk, please feel free to apply.  I was in that boat a<br>
long time ago, so I know how it is. <br>
<p>
WHAT WE ARE OFFERING:<br>
<p>
We are offering stock options (Silicon Valley gold?), a telecommuting<br>
option in the near future, a flexible, Extropian-friendly environment, an<br>
opportunity to develop new technologies and skills, an environment that<br>
fosters creative and new ideas, as well as a salary.<br>
<p>
<p>
QUICK OVERVIEW:  I am building a new company.  We have plenty of investors,<br>
plenty of capital, experienced and well-connected business and marketing<br>
arms, and realistic growth potential.  Our core technologies are related to<br>
Intranet/NC/Web based business applications running off database backends,<br>
especially Oracle.  Personally, this is an area of very strong expertise<br>
and technology development experience, so we are not jumping into this<br>
blind.  I am bringing a wealth of proven tools, technologies, and<br>
techniques.  Our target market (which I have been working in directly for<br>
over a year) is virtually devoid of companies qualified to provide<br>
business-critical, high-throughput applications in this environment.<br>
Demand is quite high and growing, but remains mostly unmet or poorly<br>
implemented at high cost.  Additionally, we intend to develop commercial<br>
applications designed to work in an NC-style environment.  For those that<br>
are not aware, several countries (such as the Philippines and Singapore)<br>
have entered enormous contracts to wire their entire countries with the NC<br>
environment.<br>
<p>
<p>
HERE IS WHAT I AM CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR:<br>
<p>
Java Programmers:  We won't be building crapplets, so if you are interested<br>
in putting a razor-sharp edge on your Java skills, this is the place to do<br>
it.  You will be developing creative and intelligent application interfaces<br>
as well as developing APIs and class libraries.  If you have Java skills of<br>
any type, please apply.<br>
<p>
<p>
Oracle Programmers:  We are looking for flexible Oracle PL/SQL programmers<br>
who are willing to learn new technologies.  Web and Oracle Webserver<br>
experience a plus.  Forms, Reports, and Pro*C experience a plus, but not<br>
required by any means.  If you are an Oracle programmer and want to get<br>
some real Web experience, this is the place to do it.<br>
<p>
<p>
Database Analysts:  We need database analysts who have experience spec-ing<br>
and designing database, business, and application logic.<br>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Please email me with a brief description of your skills if you are<br>
interested in any of the above positions.<br>
<p>
If you have any questions about any of this feel free to email me.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
<p>
