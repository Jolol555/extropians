I'd like to clear up the following:<br>
<p>
a) Mike Rose, me, did not post the original 'water-car' mail<br>
2) he dosn't believe the car works<br>
c) nor does he believe is doen't/couldn't<br>
iv) he was just interested in the fact that some guy had managed to get<br>
   his 'theory' published, and that the guy must be lying if his opponents<br>
   are correct. The article seemed to say that he rides this car <br>
   regularly.<br>
<p>
<p>
I just wanted to know if it was an outright lie, the product of delusion<br>
or something some people may have missed. Seeing as none of the opponents<br>
seemed to have read the offending article I am still uncomfortable with<br>
picking any one of the above.<br>
<p>
Thanks....<br>
<p>
<p>
M.<br>
