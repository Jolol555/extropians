No, it doesn't. <br>
<p>
High economic growth rates to not mean a high life standard. It's<br>
sustainable economic development that counts.<br>
<p>
The example of Russia shows best that market liberation makes many<br>
people very poor and a few very rich. The average differs and is<br>
dependant on the power structures in the country, the economic<br>
relationships and the existing economy.<br>
<p>
Besides, the most boosting economy of the century, the Japanese, is<br>
characterized by high state intervention. <br>
