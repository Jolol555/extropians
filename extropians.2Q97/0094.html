<i>&gt;Now if we all knew that we were moving to a future with no substantial</i><br>

<i>&gt;unfair to train people for old sex roles.  But this may not be our</i><br>
<i>&gt;future.  Maybe our genetic heritage implies that the sexes differ in</i><br>
<i>&gt;what they *want*, such as perhaps women enjoying child rearing more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;So the big questions are:  what do we want, and what can we expect?</i><br>
<p>
My big beef with current equalization of sex roles is that while women are<br>
encouraged to take on traditionally male roles of laborer and competitor, men<br>
are not encouraged to take on traditionally female roles of homemaker and<br>
conciliator.  While I'm pretty neutral on who does what, I worry about a<br>
society short of homemakers and conciliators.<br>
<p>
I have a pretty laissez-faire attitude towards societally-chosen sex roles.<br>
 Like it or not, questions of what we want and expect in this category are<br>
very complex, and with the 30-40 year lag time it takes a lot of time to<br>
resolve.  This is one of those cases where if the information isn't in yet,<br>
you can't make a good decision.  If sex roles are to change significantly,<br>
for whatever reason, it's going to take a century or so of "settling out" to<br>
adjust to the new situation.<br>
