Someone (Eugene?) noted that the future would be more like Vinge than<br>
Banks.  The neat thing is that apart from AI and other Zone effects,<br>
there is no conflict; the Culture could easily be some civilization in<br>
the Beyond, and the Beyond isn't too different from the galaxy of the <br>
Culture.  True, the Culture dominates the scene in a way that no Beyond<br>
civilization does at the time of AFutD, but it is still only part of a<br>
chaotic whole (and rather chaotic itself.)<br>
<p>
Assuming that the Culture is possible at all; I doubt Banks' view of<br>
economics.  Still, it may well be -- simply so rich that trade is rare<br>
and money falls out of use.  Maybe.<br>
<p>
But one thing I like about his universe is his merger of the Big Bang<br>
and continuous creation: imagine the universe not as an expanding<br>
balloon, but as an onion of expanding balloons.  The source singularity<br>
is eternal, ever putting out new universes which expand endlessly.  (Or<br>
perhaps collapse, with more complex topology, but I've failed with his<br>
doughnut.)  Existence is infinite, but chopped up into finite parcels.<br>
