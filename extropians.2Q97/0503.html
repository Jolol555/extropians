<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;I believe the Extropians, on the whole, seriously lack an appreciation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;for the importance of an individual's obligation to the community.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Those libertarians among us (probably the ones you're thinking of)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have a *very* serious idea of an individual's obligation to the community,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and where that obligation ends.  I'm obliged to peacefully coexist with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; others, and that is it, period.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You are speaking from theory.  In reality, I don't think anyone has yet</i><br>
<i>&gt; shown that a society without compulsion can compete with other societies</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the real world.  I am aware that there are some good ideas floating</i><br>
<i>&gt; around about how to provide for common defense without military</i><br>
<i>&gt; conscription, create an educated electorate and a healthy</i><br>
<i>&gt; information-service-based economy without compulsory schooling, provide a</i><br>
<i>&gt; stable money supply without a government monopoly on coinage, etc. But</i><br>
<i>&gt; until they have been proven to work, it's silly to get indignant about it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Really, Phil, I would have thought that the SOviet Union collapse while<br>
we were in our biggest bull market would be enough of an exclamation<br>
point to put paid the tired old tyrants claim that compulsion is for<br>
your own good.<br>
<p>
Its like the Internal Revenue Code: The code itself says that paying<br>
income taxes is entirely voluntary, what they don't say is that while<br>
you can elect not to pay taxes, businesses cannot employ you, banks<br>
won't hold your funds, etc while you are not paying. If they work with<br>
you, they can lose their government approved licenses to operate as<br>
corporations. This is government's  idea of voluntarism: complusory<br>
voluntarism, a nice oxymoronic piece of doublespeak that one would<br>
expect only to see on the pages of Orwell or Huxley.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe you have a "right" to absolute freedom from the interference of</i><br>
<i>&gt; others.  So what?  It's irrelevant if it's impractical.  It's childish</i><br>
<i>&gt; to get upset because you don't have something that you can't have.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe we can build these Utopias, but only with a complete restructuring</i><br>
<i>&gt; of our society and culture.  Just grabbing at "rights" willy-nilly will</i><br>
<i>&gt; probably not do it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And it seems to me you should allow, in your broad formulation of rights,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that people have the right to build communities as they see fit, including</i><br>
<i>&gt; ones that use compulsion, as long as they allow people to leave those</i><br>
<i>&gt; communities.  If there are no non-compulsory communities out there for you</i><br>
<i>&gt; to go to, well, that's too bad, but maybe it's evolution in action.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
Yes, the existing monopolies of power all recognise each other's<br>
authority to their own territory, and as a group repress attempts to<br>
change this collusion of tyranny. THis will change with cheap space<br>
travel, one of the reasons they don't want it to become available.<br>
