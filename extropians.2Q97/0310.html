Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt;Hansen's idea for fixed-time debates could be adapted to a mailing</i><br>
<i>&gt;list like this to control list traffic and optimize quality of</i><br>
<i>&gt;postings. </i><br>
<p>
I don't know if you got to read the last newsletter, but there will <br>
be some changes coming to this list soon that are the result of much <br>
discussion and thought about some recurrent problems.<br>
<p>
While I agree with Robin on the base point that time has an economic <br>
value and that it represents a resource that must be carefully managed <br>
within a group, I fail to understand how rendering that into coinage of <br>
any sort will solve the problems that plague group discussions, <br>
because those problems usually stem from factors other than the amount <br>
of time someone speaks.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The total</i><br>
<i>&gt;time of the debate is fixed, but who talks most depends on who</i><br>
<i>&gt;the participants want to hear from most.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt;From a design standpoint, for any facilitation process to be fully </i><br>
effective, it must make accomodations for what is known as 'minority' <br>
viewpoints, the word 'minority' referring both to the social standing <br>
of the speaker and the popularity of a viewpoint.  I could predict <br>
a situation in which a few people are highly 'paid' to silence someone <br>
else, akin to holding a filibuster.  Or a situation in which the <br>
economic incentive to garner more 'coins' leads to the development of <br>
opposing factions that stall collaborative discussion.  <br>
<p>

To adapt this to a mailing list, the moderator of the list maintains<br>
a Chaumian digicash mint (here's where we need cypherpunks), in which<br>
the digicoins are /posting rights/, and are similarly exchangeable.<br>
If you're rich and don't have anything to say, email your coins to<br>
someone you find interesting.  If you're poor and want to post, beg<br>
for coins from others.  Or another possibility is to archive every<br>
message sent, paid for or not, but only distribute the paid ones;<br>
then anyone with more time who wanted to could browse the unpaid<br>
archive and send mail to some poster saying "I liked this, and I'll<br>
pay for you to post it to the main list."  That way we eliminate<br>
begging by email, which might make some uncomfortable.  Posting to<br>
the unpaid list is something like lobbying for a grant.<br>
<p>
The details that need to be worked out are the specific method used<br>
for distributing and cashing in the coins.  We might not even need<br>
something as complex as digicash: just issue coins as serial numbers,<br>
and tell people to put the number in brackets on line 1 of the post<br>
to spend it.  The moderator might maintain a 'bot that issues the<br>
coins randomly to list members at a given rate, and he can control<br>
the rate to "inflate" the list if there's a good discussion going on,<br>
or slow its growth during quiet periods to avoid accumulation.<br>
<p>
The minimal setup is this: two distribution lists (paid and unpaid),<br>
a robot at the list address that splits the messages and cashes the<br>
the coins, a robot that issues the coins, two Web archives.  Perhaps<br>
better is to have a robot actually keep track of all the coins and<br>
who owns them, so that users won't lose them--that would require<br>
them to go to a web page form to give a coin to another list member.<br>
Perhaps some user software to simplify the process would be nice.<br>
<p>
One problem I forsee: since the above assumes 1 coin=1 post, there<br>
will be incentive to make long rambling single posts on multiple<br>
topics, so we may have to either set a fixed limit, or pay per page,<br>
or some other standard (but then quoting or attributing others costs<br>
you, so would discourage that).<br>
<p>
Any ideas how to fix those incentives, or other ideas?<br>
