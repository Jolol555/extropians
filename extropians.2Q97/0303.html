<i>&gt; Why would the Air Force do such a thing? Consider the embarrassment! The</i><br>
<i>&gt; nation would be outraged, and the Air Force en masse would be grounded</i><br>
<i>&gt; pending hearings and investigations. Also the potential "cover-up" would</i><br>
<i>&gt; only involve a small group of pilots, controllers, and officers.</i><br>
<p>
Piffle...<br>
<p>
When I was in the Army, a guy went nuts and took off with an armed <br>
M-1 Abrams tank.  He headed straight for the East German border.  A <br>
platoon of M-1s were scrambled to intercept him, with orders to shoot <br>
if he got within 50 meters of the border.  The MP's arrested him when he <br>
stopped at a gas station for cigarettes.<br>
<p>
Not for a moment did anyone give a second thought to lighting him <br>
up, nor was there even the slightest hint that a cover up would be needed.  <br>
Shooting to prevent the commision of a major felony was well within <br>
our rules of engagement.  The only difference is that an A-10 could <br>
do a *lot* more damage.<br>
