In a message dated 97-04-06 08:31:02 EDT, you write:<br>

<i>&gt; to accept that they are programmed entities. Our mythology tells us that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  we aren't, and you have to break through that programming before you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;  start on anything else.</i><br>
<p>
This is a good point. I also think that the difficulty is more complicated<br>
than 'erasing old tapes' - although that's a great psychological advantage. <br>
The real dilemma is we do not fully understand the programming instructions<br>
already there, (although encouraging leaps have been made recently, in neuro<br>
bio. &amp; cog. sci. ) so we do not fully understand how to program new ones.<br>
This is one reason why AI is so facinating.<br>
<p>
Regarding ego ( Ego) and bliss... the so called 'spiritual ( which I beleive<br>
is just another part of our brain's inner working) bliss'  of letting go of<br>
the ego ( awareness of the separation between self and reality) is well<br>
known. An interesting topic. It seems to be hardwired into many humans. Some<br>
religions claim that this is letting in "god".<br>
I think it is important in an evolutionary sense, regarding consciousness. <br>
<p>
In the Emotional Computer thread, the type of emotions ( instructions of a<br>
level of say, a lower animal's emotions)  "easily programmed" into computers<br>
were not compex enough to be useful to cognition at any level i could<br>
understand, unless just as a starting point.<br>
 This "Ego" would be a good emotion to program into an A I.<br>
