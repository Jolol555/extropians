Hal Finney just wrote:<br>
&lt;Several years ago I read (and reported here on) a book called "The <br>
Big Bang Never Happened".  The author challenged conventional theories <br>
about the formation and evolution of the universe.&gt;<br>
<p>
Not having been part of the Old List, last summer I too posted a <br>
review of Eric Lerner's book which Hal mentions.  Unlike Hal's post, <br>
mine is in the archives at<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.96/0195.html">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.96/0195.html</a><br>
if anyone is interested. (Most of my post was a summary of Lerner's <br>
comments on the philosophy of science, though, rather than the details <br>
of plasma cosmology.)<br>
<p>
Hal added:<br>
&lt;Most theories that totally contradict the conventional wisdom turn <br>
out to be wrong, so this one probably is, too.  But Robin's comment <br>
about the possibility of very large scale, strong magnetic fields <br>
reminded me of this earlier theory.  There are a lot of things which <br>
cosmologistsy can't explain, so the door is not yet closed on <br>
alternatives.&gt;<br>
<p>
Yes, I find these Anisotropic Universe comments interesting in light <br>
of the recent thread where it was suggested that the only ones still <br>
questioning the Big Bang theory were creationists.<br>
