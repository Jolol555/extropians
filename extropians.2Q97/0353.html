Coordinating between NodeNet and pay-for-merit may be difficult as there is<br>
a difference in philosophy. NodeNet involves central planning whereas the<br>
other is market-based.<br>
<p>
One common point to both of these schemes is that they rely on some measure<br>
of majority opinion of worth. Ideally we would each filter on our own<br>
measures of worth, as with Sasha's document rating proposal (not<br>
coincidentally related to his work at Firefly on rating movies, web sites,<br>
and now books). Combining document rating with a payment scheme (as I<br>
suggested some time ago) might be the best solution, as you get both<br>
measures of both similarity and worth.<br>
<p>
In brief, an author says what a message costs (or a subscription to her<br>
messages): one-liners may be free, substantive postings 5 coins, essays 10<br>
coins, whatever. The author is charged a fee by length of post. Readers rate<br>
the message on what they think it is worth. As with Firefly your ratings are<br>
compared to others, and the system recommends messages to you. You can then<br>
pay the author the fee to read the message, and subsequently rate it (if it<br>
wasn't worth the entrance fee, too bad).<br>
