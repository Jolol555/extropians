&lt;Making sure a study has a good methodology is HARD, especially in a <br>
fuzzy area such as cognitive medicine, and it is easy to be fooled by <br>
one's convictions. A lot of arguments are built on animal experiments <br>
(one of my recurring nightmares: the rat hippcampus does something <br>
completely different from the human hippocampus) and individual <br>
studies, which is weak. The nootropics movement really needs some <br>
clear, careful research, but in the current situation that may be hard <br>
to implement.&gt;<br>

And one person's hippocampus may do 'something' different from <br>
another's, or the same person's hippocampus does something different <br>
one day compared to another.  These kinds of tests and 'animal <br>
experiments' _can_ provide useful data about physical, chemical causes <br>
and effects, but without higher-level models (such as the memory model <br>
you mentioned) the won't tell us much of anything *interesting at a <br>
higher level*.<br>

Yes, 'gullible' people who rely on their own experiences can be <br>
'fooled' by 'placebo effects'.  Just what this placebo effect really <br>
is is an even more interesting question.  The objectivist skeptic is <br>
just as easily fooled by convictions.  BTW, how do we measure <br>
conviction?<br>

P.S. In a field closer to my own occupation - I produce 'objective' <br>
economic statistics - I noticed a story in yesterday's Wall Street <br>
Journal about how business analysts 'in the trenches' find it <br>
absolutely essential to supplement such statistics with annecdotal <br>
evidence in order to make useful decisions on a real-time basis.<br>
