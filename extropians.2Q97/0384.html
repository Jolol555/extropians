Lee Daniel Crocker:<br>
<i>&gt;with two working brain cells can see isn't capable of that.  Thank</i><br>
<i>&gt;you, at least, for giving me information with which I can evaluate</i><br>
<i>&gt;the likely intellectual merit and honesty of your future posts.</i><br>
<p>
I spent a great deal of time trying find a method of expressing my <br>
reaction to this, either on or off the list, that would fall within <br>
the list ethics and intellectual standards that this list attempts to <br>
maintain.  In the face of accusations of this sort, I don't know what <br>
to say, or whether I should even attempt a reply.  I could use some <br>
guidance here from someone more experienced on this list.<br>
<p>
Some seem to believe that I have a great deal of time to waste and <br>
possess the desire to take potshots at people's ideas for the fun of <br>
it.  I don't.  But I cannot remain silent about issues regarding <br>
access, voice, and participation.  In the prior discussions that led <br>
to the Node concept, these issues were discussed in a manner that <br>
these concerns were listened to and considered.  It saddens me that <br>
this discussion led to statements such as the above, because I was <br>
willing to listen carefully to what Lee had to say about his own <br>
concerns and intentions.  But then, my time is my own to spend on <br>
such frivolous activities as that, I suppose.<br>
