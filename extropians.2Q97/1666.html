Very true. Still, I would like to be able to learn the basics of many<br>
fields so that I could develop them further in my own style. often I<br>
have found that one has to learn the basics just to understand if a<br>
field is worth pursuing or not, and what potential one has in it. If<br>
basic knowledge could be transferred, it would be great. But I doubt<br>
anybody could download "Microsoft Ultimate Pianist" and become more<br>
than a brilliant entertainment at the next party. <br>
<p>
What we value in pianists (and other experts) is their personal<br>
touches, that is why we don't regard painting by numbers as art (but<br>
if you start from painting by numbers and then do something<br>
individual with it, like changing the colors or adding new details,<br>
then you are suddenly creating art). Maybe in the future art school<br>
will consist of one week of downloading of technical skills, and then<br>
several years of individualization. <br>
