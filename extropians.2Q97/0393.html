Lee's tone was unnecessarily rude.  But I also think you were too<br>
quick to conclude you disagreed over goals, rather than over methods,<br>
and I think Lee perceived this as an insult.  Holding goals constant,<br>
there are reasonable cases to be made for all the various alternatives<br>
discussed.<br>
<p>
Btw, do you see the irony in your advocating the choice of your<br>
official ExI committee on the grounds of it better promoting<br>
participation, when general list members were not offered a chance to<br>
participate in or even observe this committe discussion, and still<br>
have been told very little about the actual choice?<br>
