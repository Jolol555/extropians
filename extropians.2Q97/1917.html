Hagbard:<br>
<i>&gt;I agree that many people are often risk-averse. However this is still a</i><br>
<i>&gt;function of imperfect information. Why does one choose not to invest in</i><br>
<i>&gt;a new software firm? Because he doesn't know that the firm will</i><br>
<i>&gt;eventually be Microsoft. In the same way, a person who decides not to</i><br>
<i>&gt;risk a drive to the beach because it may rain, only wishes he knew more</i><br>
<i>&gt;about weather systems when it turns out to be a beautiful day. IMO,</i><br>
<i>&gt;people are inherently self-aggrandizing (as I have offered before on</i><br>
<i>&gt;this list), and if they *KNOW* they will be increased by a certain</i><br>
<i>&gt;change in situation, skill, or whatever, they *WILL* accept the change,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and quite often, pursue it for themselves.</i><br>
<p>
Careful.  People *KNOW* many things that are false, and it is not<br>
possible to know the future with 100% certainty.  The main thing that<br>
people seem not to know is how probability and statistics and risk<br>
work, and what they most seem to aggrandize is what they will lose on<br>
a given down side.  Surveys show that many (most?) people are more<br>
afraid of public speaking than of death.<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I hazard a guess that most</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; participants in this list are atypical in this regard.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't know if this is true, but if it is, that means that the people</i><br>
<i>&gt;on this list probably have, or firmly believe they have, more</i><br>
<i>&gt;information than the rest of humanity.</i><br>
<p>
A given person can be an optimist in the face of scanty information,<br>
or a pessimist in the face of extensive information.  I think most<br>
people tend towards pessimism, and others towards optimism.  I tell<br>
some people everything I know about cryonics and they say "What if<br>
it doesn't work?".  My reply:  "Maybe it won't, but then nothing's<br>
changed.  The point is, what if it _does_?".<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Boat drinks,</i><br>
<p>
I like that farewell,<br>
