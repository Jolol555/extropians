Turning pain off might be too extreme.<br>
How about,<br>
"Wait a nanosecond... <br>
this bodily conflagration is burning my flesh.<br>
Hey, I don't like that feeling."<br>
This brings to mind how much pain is needed to be pain, <br>
may be only recognition of a thing is to be reacted to as if it were pain;<br>
or is Reaction to pain what you are seeking to avoid?<br>
<p>
As for general changes being hard to deal with<br>
simply program automatic settings <br>
for predetermined situations/environments<br>
(or split second reminders to occurr at those times, as you suggest).<br>
Perhaps I am over simplifying <br>
or talking about an other thing?<br>

Practicality:<br>
If you can't see it you don't know it exists,<br>
so don't worry.<br>
<p>
Optimism:<br>
If it can't be fixed you're wrong.<br>
