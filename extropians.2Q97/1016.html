<i>&gt; From: hanson@hss.caltech.edu (Robin Hanson)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure why you think people's preferences regarding nudity would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be very different in the comon areas of a gated private development,</i><br>
<i>&gt; vs. in a private park.  If nudity is prohibited in one are, why</i><br>
<i>&gt; wouldn't it be prohibited in the other as well?</i><br>
<p>
I live in the equivalent of a private gated community right now -- a<br>
multibuilding cooperative apartment complex. The rules of behavior in<br>
common areas are extremely restrictive, largely to prevent residents<br>
from disturbing each other's quiet enjoyment of their homes.<br>
<p>
A park, on the other hand, is not directly near someone's home. Given<br>
that the reasons for the high levels of restriction in the gated<br>
community do not exist in the park and other areas, I suspect that the<br>
rules will be different -- the balance of the demands of the competing<br>
interests being different.<br>
<p>
Note that this is just a hunch -- we both could be wrong in some way<br>
that we couldn't predict in advance. Human behavior is very complex.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I don't see why we should think expectations regarding preferences on</i><br>
<i>&gt; nudity should be very far out of equilibrium.  I think most people</i><br>
<i>&gt; know what naked bodies look like.  </i><br>
<p>
I disagree partially. I think you are correct that most people are<br>
familiar with what naked bodies look like, at least theoretically, but<br>
I disagree that people are *used* to what naked bodies look like.<br>
<p>
I base this on personal experience. Before I took life drawing classes<br>
(that is, took classes in which one spent several hours drawing a nude<br>
model), I eroticized the human body to a much greater extent. Exposure<br>
to nude bodies, week after week, posed in banal positions and being<br>
forced to view them analytically to draw them, desensitized me to the<br>
nude form. I've noticed that my own degree of body modesty and "body<br>
shock" (that is, surprise at seeing a nude form) dropped dramatically<br>
as a result of this experience.<br>
<p>
This should not be surprising. To the Victorians, who rarely saw a<br>
naked ankle, even the sight of an ankle was a charged experience. To<br>
those who see the naked form repeatedly, it becomes uninteresting or<br>
even banal.<br>
<p>
Indeed, one might note that the degree of bodily exposure considered<br>
"uninteresting" in our society has dropped radically over the last<br>
century. We now are at the point where people practically go with<br>
only ritual coverage of their reproductive organs in sufficiently warm<br>
weather, as one example. This was unthinkable in Victorian times. I<br>
believe that our shock at such things has eroded from exposure,<br>
leading us to no longer notice it (much as I lost much of my shock at<br>
nudity). It is not unreasonable to assume that the existance of places<br>
open to the general public at which large numbers of people were<br>
"routinely" unclothed would lead to further erosion of current<br>
societal norms on body modesty as fewer and fewer people noticed or<br>
eroticized nudity qua nudity.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Also, within a small condo complex, does anything now prevents people</i><br>
<i>&gt; who want nudity from offering to pay an amount to the association to</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow it, thereby lowering other owner's fees? </i><br>
<p>
No, nothing does, but then again, demand is fairly low at the moment,<br>
and people do not use the common areas of such communities very much,<br>
which is one of the reasons people such as me happily tolerate<br>
draconian restrictions on activities within them.<br>
<p>
Again, all of this is merely informed speculation. I could very well<br>
be wrong about it, or the future impact could be radically different<br>
from what either of us envision. Its hard to tell. There are far too<br>
many variables, and its hard to assess them all.<br>
