<i>&gt;  With encryption on our PC we have secrecy concerning our</i><br>
<i>&gt;financial affairs if we use E-Money.  The spread of E-Money will break the</i><br>
<i>&gt;STATE/BANKS and their monopoly on the money supply.  It will also cause the</i><br>
<i>&gt;collapse of governments because of the vastly increased underground economy</i><br>
<i>&gt;which cannot be taxed.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;	The  author seemed to be unaware that the STATE could very easily tax</i><br>
<i>&gt;something that cannot be hidden, such as real estate, which they do</i><br>
<i>&gt;already.  So the STATE might be thwarted in attacking production and merely</i><br>
<i>&gt;take its share of the "action" via the spot where our home or business is</i><br>
<i>&gt;located.  The BANKS would lose their nice marriage to the STATE and would</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to compete on the open market.  With property tax, people get one tax</i><br>
<i>&gt;bill, no forms to fill out, just a bill marked "Pay this amount....." </i><br>
<i>&gt;Renters pay with greatly increased rent.  Businesses use property</i><br>
<i>&gt;efficiently.  Land speculation goes bust.  Property values drop.  The only</i><br>
<i>&gt;way out of paying taxes is to have your home or business off of STATE</i><br>
<i>&gt;controlled real estate.  (although the effect of taxes, reflected in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;higher cost of goods and services, would still be experienced).</i><br>
<i>&gt;	That, my friends, suggests Cities, Floating on the Sea and in the Air. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Private Cities, which provide (no roads of course...who would need them?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;the structure for living, playing, working.  Cities, which compete by</i><br>
<i>&gt;giving better service for less.  Cities, which provide the space for</i><br>
<i>&gt;automated hydroponic farms.  Cities, freed from the STATE.  Cities,</i><br>
<i>&gt;providing all the variety or sameness one wishes.  (Although EXTROS,</i><br>
<i>&gt;midgets, and animal trainers would probably not find a City just for</i><br>
<i>&gt;them.....perhaps a neighborhood..........a BIG neighborhood, mind you...)  </i><br>
<i>&gt;:-)</i><br>

You should visit the First Millennial Foundation's Web site at  <br>
<a href="http://www.millennial.org/">http://www.millennial.org/</a>  to see a great idea for building ocean communities.  <br>
More than an idea these people are already making real-world head-way into <br>
making it a reality.  They are already experimenting with a working OTEC in <br>
Hawaii and an extensive integrated polyculture.<br>
