<i>&gt; Any of these test would identify any smart drug effects, however it seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt; me that the measure we would be looking for can be established by comparing</i><br>
<i>&gt; markers for intelligence before supplementation - to after supplementation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Otherwise, how do we know if Jack is "naturally" a coordinated person while</i><br>
<i>&gt; Jill has always been a bit bovine.  Or that, Jill is endowed with innate</i><br>
<i>&gt; capabilities in memory, or photographic memory, while Jack's recollection</i><br>
<i>&gt; techniques are stimulated more by audio?</i><br>
<p>
The test methods available will depend on the sample space.  Predispostions<br>
can be factored out mathematically after the data are gathered--no need to<br>
do before and afters--in fact that will bias the results of those who<br>
might find or invent some reason to believe which group they are in.  <br>
<p>
And here's an important point: if we do generate enough interest to do<br>
something, and get a good sample base, we should STOP TALKING about the<br>
possible protocols of the experiment in public.  Those who will be out<br>
of the sample set--the experimenters, helpers, data collectors, and<br>
advisors--should discuss the protocol among themselves privately where<br>
the subjects can't hear, so they won't have any expectations.<br>
