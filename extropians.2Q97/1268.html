<i>&gt;&gt; The markets are far from perfect.  There are many wildly over-valued</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; companies (some over-valued for reasons I can't possibly fathom) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; many undervalued companies as well.  Also, the values of all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; securities are based on the expected *future* value and earnings,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not the current book value.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You may believe, based on "gut" that the markets aren't efficient, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;the statistics don't bear this out. In particular, attempts at</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective metrics like those used in so-called "Value Investing" turn</i><br>
<i>&gt;out not to work very well.</i><br>
<p>
Objective metrics don't work well primarily because of market inefficiency.<br>
 When you look at the markets, especially at a fine granularity, there<br>
tends to be a high level of arbitrary action that is doesn't model very<br>
well.  Models do start to make sense when the granularity gets coarser,<br>
however.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;2) It is possible to exploit market inefficiencies to make money. I've</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   seen people who are just too far out of the statistical spectrum to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   be accidents -- traders like Paul Tudor Jones and Louis</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   Bacon. These people are, however, unusual. I've seen far, far more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   people who can't manage to trade their way out of a paper</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   bag.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; The keys to making money on the market are sufficient education on how the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; market really works, and doing enough research to make informed decisions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course, the question of what "sufficient education" means is rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;hard to quantify. I've seen many smart people fail miserably in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;markets, or decieve themselves into thinking they were outperforming</i><br>
<i>&gt;the market higher than statistical chaance would permit.</i><br>
<p>
How smart you are makes no difference when it comes to investing.  Although<br>
sufficient education is a loose term, it does imply significant knowledge<br>
of relevant subjects.  Being smart won't help you if you don't have enough<br>
information or knowledge to make an informed decision.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;4) The people who do manage to make money "trading" rather than</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   "investing" are almost inevitably full time professionals who are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   very, very smart -- and even they sometimes "blow up". The author</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   of the famous "Memoirs of a Stock Operator", Larry Livingston,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   killed himself a few years after writing his book after losing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   every penny he had.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; There are many successful part-time traders.  At every brokerage there are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; one or two clients who average 100% return every year, a small group of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; clients who average 50% every year, and a very large number who average 10%</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; a year.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You do realize, though, that just random chance would lead to this</i><br>
<i>&gt;distribution, correct?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You misread the statistical distribution.  The *number* of people in each<br>
category do follow statistical distribution, but that they make as much as<br>
they do is *not* statistical.  I was referring to individuals producing<br>
consistent returns above and beyond the markets year after year.<br>
<p>
For an individual to consistently outperform the markets year after year is<br>
not random chance.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;What you are advocating is "active investing", the notion that you can</i><br>
<i>&gt;do much better than the market by just putting a fairly modest amount</i><br>
<i>&gt;of time in. I don't really believe that strongly any more. It is</i><br>
<i>&gt;demonstrably possible that you can do better than the market -- but it</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't easy. Remember, if it was, everyone would do it. The markets</i><br>
<i>&gt;*are* fairly efficient.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
You are right.  It isn't that easy.  It takes time and experience to start<br>
producing consistent above market performance.  Very few investors take the<br>
time to really investigate their positions.  The top reasons people invest<br>
in a company are "a friend told them it was a good company to invest<br>
in","the company has 'cool' products", and "they heard the company was in a<br>
hot market".  None of these reasons justify investing in any company, yet<br>
most people invest this way and lose money by it.<br>
<p>
Just because so few amateur investors invest properly doesn't mean that<br>
none do, or that it is impossible to learn.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;On the other hand....</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;1) Over the long term, the stock market DOES outperform almost all</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   other investments -- and outperforms it handsomely.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;2) You don't even have to think much to make money in the markets:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   passive investments like buying into an S&amp;P 500 following mutual</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   fund do bring their investors excellent returns.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Safe and profitable, but not aggressively profitable.  It will take decades</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to grow a sizeable sum, especially if you are starting small.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, "slow and steady wins the race". Better to get a nice steady 15%</i><br>
<i>&gt;a year than zero.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
15%?  Not on an index fund.  Realistically, it is more like 10-12%, with<br>
10.x% being the long-term historical range.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;3) Even random portfolios of sufficient size do pretty well in</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   general.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Random portfolios are stupid.  You might as well invest in a mutual fund,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which is probably safer.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I see you haven't been following the research.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact, a large random portfolio isn't especially stupid. It tracks</i><br>
<i>&gt;the market average well. Most people can't afford sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt;diversification to get a large random portfolio -- you need a lot of</i><br>
<i>&gt;different stocks to make one track the market properly -- and you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;likely to do as well far more easily with an index fund, but there is</i><br>
<i>&gt;little reason to refer to a large random portfolio as "stupid", and</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is little reason to believe an active mutual fund to be "safer".</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Why would you want to track the market average?  The market averages are<br>
not spectacular (and don't let the market boom of the last couple years<br>
fool you).  You would be better off buying into a smaller mutual fund that<br>
doesn't track markets.  There are non-tracking mutual funds that haven't<br>
had a negative return in 75 years, yet the market has historically spent a<br>
significant amount of time in the red.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;4) People who have a slight information edge -- like understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   what a high tech company does -- can sometimes get an advantage</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;   even if they aren't full time investors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Absolutely.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Note my caution. "Sometimes".</i><br>
<p>
<p>
By "absolutely", I was stating that you are in a position to make a wise<br>
investment.  That is, you would know whether to make an investment at all.<br>
Knowing when not to invest is nearly as big an advantage as knowing when to<br>
invest.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; I have a third option:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Taking the time to do adequate research and to make informed decisions pays</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; off handsomely.  I probably spend 20 hours per month doing research and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; educating myself on the market.  As a result, I have done very well over</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the years, and far better than the indices.  I am usually holding 6 to 8</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; stock positions at any one time and have not had a negative month that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; can remember.  To date this year I have averaged ~8% return every month.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is the question: is your performance truly out of line with the</i><br>
<i>&gt;markets? Absolute returns aren't very interesting -- returns relative</i><br>
<i>&gt;to market, and the statistical likelyhood of getting there by</i><br>
<i>&gt;accident, are far more interesting.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also, remember -- higher return often is a sign of higher risk.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
My returns are almost always significantly above the market.  To date I<br>
have returned almost 50% on my stock investments this year.  The risk of my<br>
portfolio is really very average.<br>
<p>
For example, my current active (i.e. short-term) portfolio ( I do have<br>
long-term positions, but not many ) is:<br>
<p>
WLA - Warner-Lambert Company  ( big pharmaceutical group )<br>
TQNT - Triquint Semiconductor ( gallium-arsenide communications chip design<br>
and fab )<br>
VISX - VISX ( surgical lasers, esp. eye surgery )<br>
SUNW - Sun Microsystems<br>
DEC  - Digital Equipment Corp.<br>
<p>
I've held all these stocks ~6 weeks (+/-2) and my return on this portfolio<br>
for the last 6 weeks is 16.2% (after adjusting for costs of trading).<br>
<p>
Indices for the same period (rounded to the nearest percent):<br>
<p>
S&amp;P 500:  +12%<br>
NASDAQ:   +12%<br>
Dow IA:   +12%<br>
<p>
p.s. I wouldn't recommend buying these stocks now.  Most are past their<br>
buying range and some are near their selling point.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Some years are better than others, but I consistently do far better</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; than the market by making intelligent trades and not reacting to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; fluctuations and fickleness of the market (especially the NASDAQ!).</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I rarely hold a stock position more than a year and often no more</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; than 6 months.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll point out that the second richest man in the U.S., Warren</i><br>
<i>&gt;Buffett, often holds positions for years or decades.</i><br>
<p>
<p>
That is his method of investment, and he has done well by it.  Give me as<br>
many years as he has had and maybe I will be the second richest man in the<br>
U.S. ;^)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; For those with only small amounts of money to invest (say $50 per month), I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; would recommend investing in growth oriented mutual funds.  The brokerage</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; houses penalize small trades heavily.  Trading stocks starts to become</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; economical when you have enough money saved to start buying at least 40-50</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; shares per trade.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;40 or 50 shares is still too small -- you pay extra commission for odd</i><br>
<i>&gt;lots, and round lots are always multiples of 100 shares except for</i><br>
<i>&gt;oddball stocks like Berkshire Hathaway which trades at $30,000 a share.</i><br>
<p>
Schwab charges $0.03/share or $29.95, whichever is higher.  You can buy<br>
odd lots at no penalty.  Of course the exception to this is NASDAQ which is<br>
almost always more expensive to trade on.<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; There is some risk involved, but there is no need to put such a grim spin</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on trading.  There are many people who make consistent profits as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; part-time, amateur traders.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;True enough, but it isn't trivial. *That* you save and invest steadily</i><br>
<i>&gt;is far more important than *if*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't want to sound like a naysayer -- there is nothing wrong with</i><br>
<i>&gt;picking your own stocks. However, it isn't the way most people are</i><br>
<i>&gt;going to become rich, and it is *real work*. If you are better at some</i><br>
<i>&gt;other profession, investment is not the road to getting rich</i><br>
<i>&gt;quick. Indeed -- there ARE no roads to getting rich "quick" that work</i><br>
<i>&gt;reliably.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<p>
I am not saying this is a "get rich quick" scheme.  It will still take a<br>
long time to accumulate real wealth, but the returns will be larger and<br>
faster if you take an active interest in it.<br>
