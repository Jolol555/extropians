Bobby - PICS can be used to facilitate "censorship" (by many definitions)<br>
if the censor has the power to filter the pages that the user accesses.<br>
China could force users to go through approved proxy servers which would<br>
filter out pages the government didn't like, just as parents could force<br>
their children to use filtering software.  Where along this line you start<br>
calling it censorship will vary from person to person, but obviously it<br>
could make it easier to apply these kinds of restrictions.<br>
<p>
More broadly, though, PICS really gives more information about the<br>
data being labelled, and it packages it in a form which makes it easy<br>
to filter.  As with other advances in making data available (like the<br>
net itself), this has good and bad consequences.  Making it easier for<br>
people to filter by themselves inherently makes it easier for people to<br>
filter on behalf of others.  This is analogous to the way in which the<br>
net makes it easier for people to get both "good" and "bad" information,<br>
by whatever definition you use.<br>
<p>
My opinion is that blaming PICS for making censorship easier is not<br>
the right way to look at it, blaming the messenger for the message.<br>
The real people at fault are the censors.  They are the ones at whom<br>
criticism or political pressure should be aimed.  A system like PICS<br>
follows in the grand tradition of the net, making more information<br>
available, more conveniently.<br>
<p>
Many traditional supporters of free speech on the net are opposed to<br>
PICS, but I think they are being inconsistent.  They oppose restrictions<br>
on access to information, but here is a kind of information which they<br>
don't want to see propagated.  I personally support measures like PICS<br>
which provide more information about what is on the net.  I oppose the<br>
efforts of censors to stop adults from having access to the information<br>
they desire.  Both of these positions seem entirely consistent to me.<br>
