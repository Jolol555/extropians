<i>&gt; The truly depressing explanation for the Fermi paradox is that,</i><br>

<i>&gt; suffer a phase change when subjected to the right disturbance --</i><br>
<i>&gt; and that disturbance is something technological civilizations </i><br>
<i>&gt; inevitably do. Thus, around every former such civilization, </i><br>
<i>&gt; there is a sphere of changed spacetime expanding at the speed of</i><br>
light,<br>
<i>&gt; accompanied by the non-trivial amounts of energy released by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; phase change.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That would certainly explain the Fermi Paradox, wouldn't it? ;-}</i><br>
<p>
No, it wouldn't; in fact, the false vacuum hypothesis makes it worse.<br>
If this hypothesis is true, it means that there were no technological<br>
civilizations in our galaxy until extremely recently: at most 50,000<br>
years or so.  <br>
<p>
Actually, I think that this is a pretty good argument against the<br>
hypothesis that we're living in a false vacuum and that it's<br>
easy to induce a phase transition.  If it were that easy, then<br>
someone else would probably have done it by now.<br>
<p>
(But I admit that I get a kick out of imagining protests outside the<br>
construction site of the next major accelerator, with protesters<br>
waving "SAVE THE UNIVERSE" banners.)<br>
