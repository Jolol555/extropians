In a message dated 97-04-29 18:17:56 EDT, you write:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&lt;&lt; There are lots of urban legends out there about great inventions that</i><br>
have<br>
<i>&gt; been suppressed by The Powers That Be.  In these stories, They seem to use</i><br>
<i> &gt;threats, media blackouts, and murders that look like accidents.  I am</i><br>
<i> &gt;willing to believe that all such stories are bunk.  However, there is</i><br>
<i> &gt;another way to suppress an invention: licence the patent, and then don't</i><br>
<i> &gt;manufacture it.  This is entirely legal, though people don't tend to talk</i><br>
<i> &gt;about it, as it is anti-social. Does anyone know of a time when this has</i><br>
<i> &gt;definitely happened? &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<p>
Definately.  There are 65 alternative energy patents bought up by the oil<br>
companies and they're not using them.  When asked why they dont they reply<br>
"Only when we have to".<br>
