        In addition, why would one want to be able to pick up a program that<br>
makes them the "ultimate pianist?"  Something must be said for the earning<br>
of knowledge...an upload program such as this would be much to simple and<br>
probably dissatisfying.  Also, most of piano playing (and indeed, most other<br>
skills) is about exploration and desire even more than it is ability.<br>
Perhaps if there was an upload that could hone the hand\eye<br>
abilities and increase the comprehension of the piano (or whatever) that<br>
might be effective, though I still doubt that it would give the player the<br>
same level of appreciation.  It goes along with the same idea that "...it is<br>
what man does not achieve that makes him strive to be the best."<br>
<p>
        This is partially based upon personal experience: I have played the<br>
piano for ten years...the first four with lessons, the latter four without.<br>
Needless to say, the aquired knowledge of the first four years has helped me<br>
to explore the areas of the last six.<br>
