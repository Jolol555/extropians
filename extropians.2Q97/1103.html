	For those who are looking for a rather mundane practical improvement (or<br>
self-transformation) the dvorak keyboard is not too demanding and has some<br>
benefits, the most important of which is less finger movement which<br>
translates to less wear and tear on the joints and a faster typing speed. <br>
I am somewhat biased as dvorak is the first keyboard layout I learned to<br>
"really" type on (I just had to be different) but it is definitely an area<br>
that a frequent computer user should look into.  It took me about two weeks<br>
to get adjusted to dvorak using a lesson plan (just a text file, but it<br>
worked quite well) I found on one of the dvorak pages that can be found<br>
through Yahoo.  I never finished the final lessons.  The last keys were the<br>
most obscure so I learned them through use.<br>
