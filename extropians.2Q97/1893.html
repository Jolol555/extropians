<p>
For some groups there is a correlation between income and IQ over a<br>
number of decades.  If we postulate that there is some factor that<br>
causes both higher IQ and higher income it seems likely that the<br>
income results will compound over time.  <br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Varing the IQ variance for a fixed lifespan, is there some maximum IQ</i><br>

<i>&gt;longer lifespans are required to take advantage of it?</i><br>
<p>
I don't think IQ differences above a certain level are meaningful but<br>
let's assume they are or deal with IQ's below that level.  Given a<br>
large number of income generating puzzles some percentage of them<br>
will benefit from a higher IQ, the more difficult one's coming up<br>
less frequently.  Again I think the compound interest analogy is good<br>
with very high IQs adding small percentages which take a long time to<br>
become significant.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Or am I tring to read too much into a few noisy data points? </i><br>
<p>
There is a lot of IQ and income data out there so I suspect you could<br>
develop a number of testable hypotheses.  It is interesting but<br>
I can't think how the results would be useful.  In any case I doubt<br>
you will get a chance to reap the full benefits of your own prodigious<br>
IQ before intelligence increasing technology becomes widely available.<br>
