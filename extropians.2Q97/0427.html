John K Clark:<br>
<i>&gt; Mass, energy, momentum, electric charge, spin, charm, and color,</i><br>
<i>&gt; are all digital quantities.</i><br>
<p>
Me:<br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Digital they aren't, discrete is what you probably meant.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; discrete they are not either.  Spin and charge of particles are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; observed as discrete values, the discreteness of color charge is</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; deduced indirectly, but mass, energy and momentum are observed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; as continuous.</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Max Planck started the entire revolution by proposing that energy is</i><br>
<i>&gt; NOT continuous, everything followed from there. Take a beam of light</i><br>
<i>&gt; for example, it has momentum nhf, h is the Planck constant, f is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; frequency of the light, and n is an INTEGER, the number of photons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Digital.</i><br>
<p>
The formula is correct, but your conclusion is not.  While n is an<br>
integer, f is not.  That means that a "beam" of light consists of<br>
a discrete number of quanta (as opposed to a continual wave), but<br>
the individual energies of those quanta can have any value from<br>
a continuous spectrum.  In a special case of coherent light, we<br>
engineer the source in such a way that all the quanta have the same<br>
energy, for example by making sure all of them are emitted from a<br>
certain transition in a certain kind of atom.  However, if you move<br>
the coherent source relative to the observer, you can change the<br>
observed frequency (energy) of the quanta by a non-discrete amount.<br>
This is called the Doppler effect.  It's even simpler to make the<br>
frequencies of quanta in the same beam different: just heat up the<br>
source!<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you want to find the momentum of an individual photon, hf, you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; find it by using the formula hN/X , h is the Planck constant again,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and N is the number of wave crests the photon makes over a distance X.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Digital.</i><br>
<p>
Another wrong conclusion.  One: N is not an integer.  A photon that<br>
has one "crest" over one meter has one point three crests over one<br>
point three meters.  Two: the number of crests depends on the frame<br>
of reference.  If you measure five crests over one meter, and I am<br>
moving relative to your rest frame, I may measure five times square<br>
root of two crests over one meter.  But now I see how you got to<br>
that conclusion:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Of course, there is a basic randomness built into the fabric of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the universe, so if we were to actually perform this experiment</i><br>
<i>&gt; when we got near the end of distance X it would not be entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt; clear if we should include the last wave crest or not. We could</i><br>
<i>&gt; minimize this problem and get a more accurate measurement of</i><br>
<i>&gt; momentum by making X bigger, but then you'd know less about</i><br>
<i>&gt; the position of the photon, X. Momentum and position have an inverse</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationship, the more you know about one the less you know about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; other, however randomness is NOT a continuous quantity, in fact it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is as far from that concept as it is possible to get.</i><br>
<p>
You're now drifting toward the question of interpretation that has<br>
been a hobby of every self-respecting quantum mechanic since the<br>
thirties.  You're trying to dump more information into the problem<br>
in order to try to make it look more "intuitive".  Counting crests<br>
of photons is a mental crutch.  In reality, what you can do is<br>
measure the energy of your pet photon.  Unfortunately, in the<br>
process you're destroying the photon itself, so the accuracy of<br>
your measurement is not constrained by the Heisenberg inequality,<br>
but rather by the construction of your apparatus.  You can even<br>
measure with some accuracy where in space did the photon convert,<br>
but that doesn't tell you whether the photon was a little ahead or<br>
a little behind that point in space at the moment of destruction.<br>
<p>
And you are right in that randomness is not a continuous quantity.<br>
In fact, it's not a quantity at all, it's a concept people have<br>
trouble imagining because it's not "intuitive".  However, an <br>
incredible mountain of evidence suggests that quantum mechanics is<br>
how universe works, so the right attitude imho is to convince<br>
oneself that there simply are questions that have no meaning within<br>
the confines of the working theory, and that their meaning emerges<br>
at some other level.  Isn't complexity fun?  :)<br>
<p>
<p>
<i>&gt; If you want to find the energy of a photon multiply the digital</i><br>
<i>&gt; momentum by a constant, the speed of light. Digital.</i><br>
<p>
No, it just says that our historical choice of units for "energy"<br>
and "momentum" was arbitrary, so we invented a "constant" to make<br>
it sound less embarrasing.  That's not a very useful observation<br>
if you build bridges for a living, but in the Universe and in my<br>
current profession c == h == 1.<br>
