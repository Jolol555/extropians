<i>&gt;&gt;Well, discussion would help, but discussion is generally with highly</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Yes you want wide participation in the discussion, but surveys are not</i><br>

<p>
Discussion and focus groups are often necessary if the topic is something<br>
people don't normally think about.  But aren't focus groups often selected by<br>
the researcher, either to reflect a sub-population, or to gather a more<br>
represtentative sample, rather than self-selected?<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;&gt;Another big problem with forecasting or discussion is that people often</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;change their minds about what they want.  It's difficult for a 20-year-old</i><br>
in<br>
<i>&gt;&gt;college who's never worked anything more than part-time casual work and</i><br>
who's<br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, but our predictions about aggregates may be better than our</i><br>
<i>&gt;predictions about individuals. </i><br>
<p>
True.  I was thinking more along the lines of how anybody could know what<br>
modern 20-year-olds (either individually or in the aggregate) will be like at<br>
40.  The 20-year-old won't know; they haven't been there, and as I outlined<br>
above, their predictions are suspect.  The 40-year-old won't know; they and<br>
their peers were different at 20 (insofar as they're the same, we have<br>
neither a change nor a problem).  <br>
