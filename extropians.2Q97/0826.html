<i>&gt;P.S. I'm sorta surprised at how antique most of the book </i><br>
<i>&gt;recommendations have been, though there's nothing wrong with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;classics...</i><br>
<p>
Science fiction in general is going through a dismal period where <br>
many of the established writers simply have run out of strong viable <br>
story ideas, or their outlines are being farmed out to less able <br>
writers by the publishers.  A glut of badly-written books, a few <br>
journals going under, a general weeding-out process of a bloated <br>
market.  How I miss the pulp journals!  But I guess eventually all <br>
these processes balance themselves out and more innovative writers <br>
will become known.  <br>
<p>
If you can find it, pick up a copy of the latest _Analog_, they <br>
usually have a decent short stories and some science news.  Also, Ben <br>
Bova has a new book out that utilizes nanotech as a plot device, it's <br>
called _Moonrise_, I think.<br>
