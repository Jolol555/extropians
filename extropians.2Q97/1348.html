<p>
Here's what I meant.  Imagine that everyone in the world had the same<br>
investment portfolio, with the same relative fraction of their wealth<br>
in each investment made anywhere.  Rich people would have more shares<br>
of this portfolio, but otherwise everyone is the same.  In this<br>
situation, I would say no one is making a bet, though everyone does<br>
suffer risk regarding the performance of the world economy as a whole.<br>
<p>
For anyone whose portfolio differs from this average portfolio, one or<br>
more other people must hold the negative of this difference in their<br>
portfolio.  I say two sides are making a bet; whatever one side gains<br>
the other side loses.  Each side also now risks that the other side<br>
has better information.<br>
<p>
Some bets are good for insurance reasons; different people may have<br>
different risk tolerances or different state-dependent preferences for<br>
wealth.  Some bets are also good because they are on what people will<br>
choose to do, and we can prefer to give people incentives to do the<br>
right thing.  But beyond this, one side in a bet is making a mistake.<br>
<p>
Since actual index funds are not exactly the average world investment,<br>
they are bets regarding the difference.  But as you put together<br>
enough indexes and approach the average, your total portfolio<br>
approaches not making a bet.<br>
