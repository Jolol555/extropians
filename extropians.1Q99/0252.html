Hold on.  7 million is their *price*, not their cost.  What that is is a
deep, dark secret, and rightly so.  7 million just happens to be about the
price where satellite companies sit up and take notice.

<p>
Personally, I'm not sure about their being able to compete in teh
satellite launch business, but I think their design is very well suited to
fast package delivery.  "When it absolutely, positively has to be in Tokyo
*yesterday*" (ain't that International Date Line great?).
