It would be interesting to see an "IQ-plus" test designed specifically
for this kind of system.  A few years ago, when I first got on the net,
they used to have internet search contests.  They would post a series of
questions, and contestants would use the then-primitive search engines
to seek out answers.  This was pre-web, back when gopher was the protocol
for linking information, and it was a lot harder to find things.

<p>
Do they still do this?  It seems to me that skill at finding things on
the net is the single most useful thing we could teach young people
in terms of "computer literacy".
