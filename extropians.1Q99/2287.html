<a name="2308qlink2">I live in the Orlando, Florida area.  We have two or three toddlers kill
other toddlers with guns every year.  It is a sad, yet constantly
repeating event in our community.  For some reason, we can't get parents
to lock up their guns, and the same tragedy keeps repeating.  We have
specialized laws and education programs, but nothing stops this trend.
The point is, our local area has more accidental child fatalities due to
guns than you claim for the entire U.S.<a name="2291qlink1">  Your statistics just don't
match reality.</a>
