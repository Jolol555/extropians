<p>
Please note that the "sexual orientation" consists of many layers, from
the direct biological mating urge to the feeling of love towards a person.

<p>
Some parts of the sexual preference appears to be programmed at a young age
by the cultural and social environment.

<p>
We need more culturally and socially neutral research on this subject.

<p>
Anders Sandberg &lt;asa@nada.kth.se&gt; might have answered:

<a href="2761.html#2805qlink2">|Interesting. I seem to lack that instinct, and have a hard time</a><br>

<p>
I lack that "instinct", too.  To me the worship meme is akin to slavery.

<p>
Compare this to John Stuart Mill.  His father was a stern believer in the
philosophy called utilism (or utiliatiarism), the ethical standpoint that
the value of our actions depends on their utility for the society.
His son was raised in this philosophy.  Anything he did had to be useful.
No playing around.

<p>
John Stuart Mill as an adult wrote the book "On Liberty" in which he took
the standpoint that everybody should have LIBERTY.  He revolted against
the stern upbringing he received from his father.

<p>
You need not postulate the existence of a gene.  It's all in the memes.

<p>
You can use exactly the same dopamine method to reprogram you to love
Big Brother, Adolf Hitler or Stalin.  No religion required, unless you
define politics as a special form of religion (makes some sense).

<p>
I would rather this the "brainwashing dopamine".  Any group programmer
can use it to rewire your programming to love the alpha unit of the group.

<p>
Same difference if used to program you to die for our beloved Führer,
to kill the infidels for our Saviour, or to save the human race from
the evil Capitalism.  OLDTHINKERS UNBELLYFEEL INGSOC.

<a href="2761.html#2805qlink5">|Religious ecstasy can definitely be understood, even if studying it</a><br>

<i>|feel wonderful, they have other properties too. And feeling wonderful</i><br>

<i>|community etc.) that we might want to separate out. Many of these can</i><br>
<i>|be reached without changing brain chemistry from the outside.</i><br>

<p>
Much of these can be accessed through the normal braina I/O channels,
such as eye and ear.  Consider the brimstone sermons in some religions,
the NSDAP Nürnberg days, the Communist mass rallies, or random cultists.
