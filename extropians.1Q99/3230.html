Well, partially. But most of society looked surprisingly normal
despite the huge changes that had occured between now and the
book. Still, the posthuman pieces are great (if a deus ex machina).

<p>
What about Ursula Le Guin? I seem to recall some different societies
in her books, but it was a long time ago I read them.

<p>
<a href="3225.html#3230qlink3">&gt; And I would say:  No, it's not easy to build a story around a soft</a><br>
<i>&gt; science.  "They require, not thinking, but scholarship."  Soft sciences</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't have sufficiently generalized rules.  You can't vary conditions</i><br>
<i>&gt; creatively in a soft science because they're tuned to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; here-and-now-and-human, and are too fragile and inelegant to be taken</i><br>
<i>&gt; out of it.</i><br>

<p>
Hmm, I think I see the problem: you want to write "hard soft science",
the kind of books Greg Egan or Robert Forward would have written if
they were economists or anthropologists (imagine a Forward-style
technical appendix afterwards, explaining the economic basis for the
story :-).

<p>
Actually, even if the rules are hard to generalize, that doesn't make
it uninteresting or impossible to come up with a good book that even
says something significant. A true artist would not just "turn the
knobs" to generalize our society, but invent a plausible or
interesting one. Soft science seems much more amenable to roleplaying
and scenario building than hard science.
