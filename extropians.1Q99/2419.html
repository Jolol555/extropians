Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of aromatherapy in
  the treatment of patients with alopecia areata. DESIGN: A
  randomized, double-blind, controlled trial
  of 7 months' duration, with follow-up at 3 and 7 months. SETTING: Dermatology
  outpatient department. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-six patients diagnosed as having
  alopecia areata. INTERVENTION: Eighty-six patients were
  randomized into 2 groups. The active group massaged
  essential oils (thyme, rosemary, lavender, and cedarwood) in a mixture of
  carrier oils (jojoba and grapeseed) into their scalp daily. The control group
  used only carrier oils for their massage, also daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
  Treatment success was evaluated on sequential photographs by 2 dermatologists
<br>
  (I.C.H. and A.D.O.) independently. Similarly, the degree of improvement was<br>
  measured by 2 methods: a 6-point scale and computerized analysis of traced
  areas of alopecia. RESULTS: Nineteen (44%) of 43 patients in the active group
  showed improvement compared with 6 (15%) of 41 patients in the control group
<br>
  (P = .008). An alopecia scale was applied by blinded observers on sequential<br>
  photographs and was shown to be reproducible with good interobserver
  agreement (kappa = 0.84). The degree of improvement on photographic
  assessment was significant (P = .05). Demographic analysis showed that the 2
  groups were well matched for prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The results
  show aromatherapy to be a safe and effective treatment for
  alopecia areata. Treatment with these essential oils was significantly more
  effective than treatment with the carrier oil alone (P = .008 for the primary
  outcome measure). We also successfully applied an evidence-based method to an
  alternative therapy.
