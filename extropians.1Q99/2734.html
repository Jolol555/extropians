<a name="2742qlink1">I think maybe I'm missing the point of this whole strain... is it intending
to say we should loosen control on guns until gun deaths exceed automobile
deaths, or that we should regulate automobiles and bathroom tiles to prevent
deaths?

<p>
Guns and automobiles are inherently different in one sense:

<p>
Guns (at least handguns) were meant to harm people, while automobiles are
not. I think I see the point you're getting at here(that guns aren't as big
a problem as people think) and I don't necessarily disagree, but it seems
we're comparing two completely different classes of things (see how I
avoided a platitude there?) by comparing auto and gun deaths.</a>
