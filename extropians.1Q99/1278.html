<p>
Do something that fascinates you and that you're good at.  I don't know 
you, so I can't say what that is, but there will be something.  It doesn't 
have to be related to biogerontology - there's a lot about being human
and becoming transhuman apart from extending lifespan.

<p>
There are many alternate paths to serious research - lab tech, accountant,
sales, management, etc.  Again, which is best for you I can't say.  I have
a friend who does regulatory submissions for bone replacements, and
loves it.
