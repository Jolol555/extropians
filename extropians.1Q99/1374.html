<p>
Organisms (or their ancestors) have had billions of years to adapt (or
even produce) the air they live in.

<p>
Synthetic detergents have appeared in the last eyeblink
of evolutionary time. Perhaps we are not as able to cope with them as
with stuff that was always there.
<br>
So it's not a bad idea ro check.

<p>
Speaking from experience, you *can* get ill efects (like dermatitis)
from detergent. In my case it was from a spell in a shampoo factory,
but there are people who have bad reactions to normal soap (eg from a
chronic deficiency in skin oils).

<p>
All the same I think I'll stick with soap unless there's a very good
reason not to,and I'd rather have anyone who handled food do the same.
