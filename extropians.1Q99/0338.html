I explicitly said otherwise.  I said that the naive people at Foresight
will publish their breakthroughs and that someone else will try to
monopolize the technology totally.  Does the US embargo prevent Saddam
from visiting Foresight's Web site?</a>

<a name="0394qlink2">The term "naive" is strong.  I began using this term when, during a
debate on red goo vs. blue goo, I pointed out nobody had proposed any

someone said, quote, "That's not fair."  Fair?  Whoa.  "I never thought
of that", says the Universe, and everyone comes back to life.  I suppose
that dropping 20 megatons on an undefended city is fair.  Fact is,

use nanotech for military attack and world domination is naive.</a>
