<a name="2181qlink2">Yes. It is. c in a vacuum is as high as anything can go. If you put</a> more energy

<p>
This is not exclusive to BE condensates. The speed of light is different in any
material, and different in each state, for example, different for steam, water,
and ice. The absolute we refer to as c, though, in most physics equations is
usually refered to as being in vacuum conditions, unless there is actually work
being done within materials.

<p>
As the article that was referred to states, the phenomemon of refraction in optics
is entire dependent on the fact that light travels slower in glass than in air or
in a vacuum. Rather than traveling a straight line, when light strikes glass at an
angle, the photons will run through their path integral of possible paths (all
possible paths), and take the one which takes the least amount of time between its
emission point and is receiving point.

<p>
Remember that it knows what its receiving point is because the photon exits as a
result of the handshake of the particles on the emission and reception ends with
virtual particles that are in phase but moving in opposite directions in time. (As
per Feynman's Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Electro-Dynamics).

<p>
Thus, the light will strike the glass at a shallow angle and travel through the
glass at a steeper angle to reach the reception point, because that path takes the
least amount of time, as it wants to travel through as little of the slow medium
(the glass) as is possible in the trip, and as much of the fast medium (the
vacuum).

<p>
I never completely understood why refraction worked until I learned how the
transactional interpretation worked....
