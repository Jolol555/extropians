<p>
Yes, absolutely, but the only safe option is IMO to build a
spacecraft with Mars range *before* "practical" nanotech
has been developed. After all, nanotech might make the
ship's construction much easier, cheaper and better, but
designing and building a viable spacecraft with nanotech
is (one would think) a lot more difficult than using it to make
lots of nukes or other weapons. There might be (nano)wars all
over the place with your design still on the drawing board, so 
to speak. 

<p>
While traveling to Mars, nanotech/ AI/uploading research would 
of course continue onboard (the most tricky "hands on" work would 
have to be done in isolated compartments towed by the main vessel, 
with a nuke close at hand just for good measure -- if something goes 
wrong you cut the cable and "bang". Maybe you don't even need
the nuke, just cutting the (long) cable will probably do). 

<p>
The crew could be composed of people who helped to finance
or otherwise support the project plus a selection of top scientists
in various fields, probably no more than approx. 200 people or so
in total, perhaps more if some form hibernation/reversible cryonics is
operational by then. Also a load of "traditionally" frozen folks
("economy class" ;) could also be taken on board. Neuros don't
take up too much space, after all, and cryogenic cooling is free out
there.

<p>
Noah's Ark with a transhuman twist (minus the animals, obviously.
Just some gene samples would do). Of course, this scenario
assumes that SI doesn't come first, and/or (very) soon.
