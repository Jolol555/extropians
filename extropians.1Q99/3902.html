You are aware that there are plans for Mars colonization already in the 
works arn't you?
<br>
Have you made them any purposals?

 ...that I am a "small woman, who has had a car wreck that
 left me with rods in my leg" (almost left without my leg)....

<p>
No, the car rolled endless amounts of times, and I was thrown out twenty 
feet, landed on my left foot. No size of car would have helped the 
situation. My friend died in this wreck, and nothing can save him now 
either. No more puns on bigger cars please.




<p>
 I did not mean to imply that this girl I spoke of does not
<br>
<a href="3865.html#3902qlink5">&gt;love life as much as you and I do.  She does, I can assure you.</a><br>



<p>
We must remember everyone is of value, even if they lack something we 
have.


<p>
<a href="3865.html#3902qlink6">&gt;As for wouldnt miss much, this might be a key point.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Our current track star astronauts might go crazy cooped</i><br>
<i>&gt;up in a farm capsule for... ever.  There are humans that are preadapted </i><br>
to this kind of existence: those who are bound to their homes for health 
reasons.  My spina biffida example: she would not miss running aroundin 
a field of tall grass, shes never been able to do that.  She would not 
miss sex, this being out of the question for her.  She would not miss 
quaffing a thick steak, shes a vegetarian.  She can entertain herself 
for indefinite periods of time with a computer, as she has done for her 
whole life and could continue to do on the long trip to Mars.

<p>
I think it would be the same compromises for her as for anyone else. 
You'd be surporized what physically challenged people are able to do.


<p>
<a href="3865.html#3902qlink7">&gt;I did realize there was a weakness in my previous arguement: that</a><br>
<i>&gt;the spina bifida victim could take a number of frozen embryos to</i><br>
<i>&gt;self implant if things go well.  In the example I gave, her pelvis is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not a whole lot bigger now than it was when she was born.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;not at all sure that her womb is functional, or if so, how the pelvis</i><br>
<i>&gt;could be modified to allow both self implantation of a frozen embryo</i><br>
<i>&gt;and childbirth without help.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps someone who is up on current medical technology could</i><br>
<i>&gt;help me out here: could an undeveloped vagina be surgically modified</i><br>
<i>&gt;into a workable birth canal assuming all voluntary muscles below the</i><br>
<i>&gt;sternum are nonfunctional?  Could the pelvis be split into two parts</i><br>
<i>&gt;for instance and connected by a releasable device?  I understand nature </i><br>
provides a cartilage in the female pelvis that comes unglued during the 
birth process.  Could the medics invent something that mimics this 
process?SPIKE

<p>
Have you considered any genetic or cloning alternatives to your 
medically crude ideas?
