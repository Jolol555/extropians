Well, lets hope your right.  But that brings up my central point - we need to take responsibility now, all of us, not just extropians and tranhumanists, but everyone who wants to create a better future, to ensure through rational planning, scenario creation, increased technological accesability, dynamic optimism, to create the future.  Since the future is up for grabs, it is we (all of us) who will ultimately determine if we end up as grey goo or waxing poetic in The Culture.  Therfore, we *must* take full responsibility about *how* these seed AI's are created, their growth algorithms, etc.  As far as grey goo, I'd suggest that as many people as possible get access as soon as possible to as much nanotech as possible.  That way it ensures that if any one specific group, no matter how malign, will have several if not hundreds of more benign competitors just as likely to develop nanotech before they can.

Since The Culture has implict immortality, I'd spend time doing all of the above.
