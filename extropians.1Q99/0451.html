<p>
If a child you created would find their life worth living, you would be 
doing them a favor by creating them.  However, I don't think failing to 
do someone a favor is "cruel."  But I don't see how you can say you're 
being kind to that possible creature by such a choice.

<p>
To me, it seems that if a creature would, if it existed, prefer
that it existed, then that creature isn't getting what it wants
if it doesn't exist.  Taking things that creatures want away from
them "harms" them.</a>

<p>
If a certain group of humans were created for food, I suspect
that the rest of us would fear we or someone we know might
someday become members of that group.  We don't have a similar
fear about cows.</a>
