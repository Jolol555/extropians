Well, I'm back from Capricon XIX, and it's now definite:  Sleep
deprivation produces transhumanist music.  This is the second time in a
row I've written a song during a con.

<p>
This is to the tune of "Santa's Gonna Kick Your Ass" from "Christmas
Turkey" by "The Arrogant Worms".  (Part of it, anyway - in mine, each
chorus sounds like the first one.)  It is no coincidence that this song
is rattled off in one of the fastest voices I've ever heard.  If you
don't know the tune, you're missing half the fun.  Sadly, I haven't
found any MIDI or MP3 of it... not that I'm suggesting anyone should
violate copyrights.

CHORUS:

<pre>
	Future's comin' and it's gonna
	Kick your ass
	It's gonna
	Kick your ass
	It's gonna
	Kick your ass
	Future's comin' and it's gonna
	Kick your ass
	You think you know what's comin' but you're wrong

</pre>
<p>
Nanotech is comin' and it's gonna
<br>
Grant you longevity
<br>
Bring you prosperity
<br>
Build you a brewery
<br>
Nanotech is comin' and it's gonna
<br>
Create your paradise
<br>
And then it's gonna turn it into goo

<p>
CHORUS:

<p>
Neurohackers comin' gonna
<br>
Pump your mentality
<br>
Choose your specialty
<br>
Cure gullibility
<br>
Neurohackers comin' gonna
<br>
Light up the pleasure center
<br>
At least we know that this part will be fun

<p>
CHORUS:

<p>
AIs comin' and they're gonna
<br>
Replace humanity
<br>
Outlaw biology
<br>
No organic chemistry
<br>
AIs comin' and they're gonna
<br>
Take over Terra
<br>
Until the Y2K bug shuts 'em down

<p>
CHORUS:

<p>
Transhumans comin' and they're gonna
<br>
Advance technology
<br>
Avert catastrophe
<br>
Do a Singularity
<br>
Transhumans comin' and they're gonna
<br>
Be inscrutable
<br>
'Cause you can't understand their point of view

<p>
CHORUS:

<p>
Powers comin' and they're gonna
<br>
Make like a deity
<br>
Transcend mortality
<br>
Control the galaxy
<br>
Powers comin' and they're gonna
<br>
Be real powerful
<br>
But please don't ask me what they do or why

<p>
CHORUS:

<p>
Omega Point is comin' gonna
<br>
Rewrite reality
<br>
Outshine divinity
<br>
Count to infinity
<br>
Omega Point is comin' gonna
<br>
Resurrect your in-laws
<br>
And then our saga and my song is done
