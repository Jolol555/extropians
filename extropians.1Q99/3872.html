Personally I think learning how to not "close up" is a more valuable skill.
That way there is no window of opportunity and learning can be with you for
much, much longer.

<p>
But your point is a very good one - when is the point where we need to say
"this child needs a certain amount of education to get by in life?" Well
perhaps we should redefine "life" instead of redefining the child and
"pushing him closed shut like a book".

<p>
Julian.
