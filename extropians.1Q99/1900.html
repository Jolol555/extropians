<p>
I have to blame myself for not having more 
effectively translated the CIA scenario, I
assumed it was know more than it is. 
<br>
Respondents don't understand what it is
<br>
so we're all talking past each other. 

<p>
We're not talking about a plane that was on a 
forward/horizontal vector and that translated 
into a downward vector (but keep in mind that 
horizontal and vertical velocity are independent,
but that's not a matter here). The CIA scenario
says that the plane shot upwards 3,200 feet 
in 20 seconds after the nose came off. Drawing
a graph finds that's an angle of attack around 
16 to 18 degrees.

<p>
<a name="1902qlink1">Anyway, the point is that the jet shot up like 
you throw a ball up, and reached a peak, would be 
at rest there, and then fell. That's the CIA scenario.</a>

<p>
  IAN: Horizontal velocity is independent of 
  vertical velocity, what that means is that 
  you don't translate forward velocity into
  downward velocity. Basic kinematics, but 
</a>
  again, not a factor in the CIA scenario.

<p>
  Speed does play a role in lift. For 
<br>
  example,tilt a wing at any angle at 
<br>
  0 mph, and it gets no lift. Give it
<br>
  some forward speed, and it has lift.

<p>
  The front end blew away, and the mid-to 
  rear sections got rear heavy causing a 
  pitch up, which the math shows will cause 
  a fatal stall in under five seconds, but 
  the CIA says it caused the noseless jet
  to shoot upwards looking like a rocket.

<p>
  Witness say that the plane rolled and fell 
  like a rock, which is exactly what happened 
  to PAN AM 103 after it lost its forward section.
