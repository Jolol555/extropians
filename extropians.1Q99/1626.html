Ah, so in general its pro-corporate pro-wealth, but not specifically toward the gun
industry. That may be their intention, but I rather thank that they are likely to get
civil war if they succeed. I know plenty of peaceful law abiding people up here who will
become revolutionary guerrillas if the city slickers win. I don't think that this area
is any different from any other rural area in the country.

<a href="1625.html#1626qlink2">&gt; &gt; ..If the</a><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; market demand, but their ability to make a profit, which also goes against</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; corporate interests.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Tell me Michael, why haven't the gun manufacturers gotten together to create their</i><br>
<i>&gt; own boycott organization?  I mean common, why haven't Ruger and Smith &amp; Wesson and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other gun manufacturers put aside their competitive instincts long enough to</i><br>
<i>&gt; realize that if they cooperate they can survive as an industry rather than watch</i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves be run out of business through increasing regulation?  If Cleveland</i><br>
<i>&gt; decides they'll no longer allow guns in their city, then the gun manufacturers can</i><br>
<i>&gt; retaliate by refusing to sell any guns to their law enforcement as well.  Such</i><br>
<i>&gt; retaliation would quickly turn the table back in their favor.  If it *is* in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; corporate interest, why haven't they done this Michael? Such a tactic is so obvious,</i><br>
<i>&gt; why have they ignored it?  Is continuing their business as usual into oblivion in</i><br>
<i>&gt; their corporate interest?</i><br>

<p>
That is a good idea, and I'll make sure I pass it along to the Ruger execs that I know
personally. They definitely aren't above that, as they recently banned the use of
Microsoft applications in their offices in retaliation for Bill Gates donating $80,000
to the gun control referendum campaign that recently lost in Washtington State.

<a href="1625.html#1626qlink3">&gt; In regards to the Democrat vs Republican run CIA, I was attempting to be</a><br>

Thats OK. I tend to beleive that the corporate interests/patrons of the two parties are
much more domestically focused, with dems supported by industries dependent on plenty of
easily pliable, economically distressed or marginal  individuals, both as a customer
base, and as a source of cheap labor. (i.e. K-Mart, Coca Cola, Reebok, Nike, Ben &amp;
Gerrys, Target, Monsanto, Archer Daniels Midland, Beatrice) Repubs are supported by
industries that have much more upscale customer and employee bases, though that has been
eroding the past 6 years. There sure must be some industries that patronize the parties
for favors overseas (Dole and Chiquita Bananas in central america, of course, the oil
companies in the middle east...etc) Its not like we fought the gulf war over
principle...
