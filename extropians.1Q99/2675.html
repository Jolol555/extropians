Extropians are working on life extension and imortality for themselves and
theirs.  What about my neighbor?  What about my Dad who died 7 years ago?  Who
has a mother, father, son or daughter who's died? What about their life
extension?</a>

them) to bring us all back in the huge, holy computers of the future.</a>

<p>
BUT WILL THEY?  

<p>
That is the question.

<p>
That is why I intend to build an institution, designed to last long enough, to
actually make sure this happens, The Church of the Modern Era.

<p>
My son hates this.  He says why a church?  Why not a foundation or something,
anything but a Church.

<p>
This is a big goal.  I can think of none larger.  Its implementation will
require many millions of people (on this planet and throughout the universe).
And not just extropians, by the way, although Extropians could be the leaders
and motivators, if any so wished.  Life extension for everyone, what could be
more democratic?

<p>
I say, put your ideals where your mouth is.

Modestly,
