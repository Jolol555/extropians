<p>
What about this shot at an objective morality?

<p>
Metamorality: Morality is by definition good. For morality to exist, there
has to be something. Morality cannot exist in nothing. Before the big bang
there was no universe, thus no morality.

<p>
I think I disagree. Before there was sentient life, there was no morality.
Morality makes no sense (as a system to support our decision-making) without
a self-reflective ability to choose between yes and no, should and should not.
Life which does not have this ability is simply following its blind genetic coding.

<p>
Morality: Anything that makes the universe exist longer and fights the
entropy is moral. The highest form of morality is whatever increases
extropy.

<p>
But isn't this an arbitrary definition (ie., non-objective?).
Why should we think that it is a good definition? How does it help us
predict human behavior?

<p>
Couldn't it be as simple as that?

<p>
Things are never that simple :-)
