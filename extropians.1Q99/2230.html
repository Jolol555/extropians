You are *wrong*.  Morality is not *known* to be arbitrary, and that
means the probabilistic landscape of desirability isn't flat.  I *am*
trying to abolish my survival instinct, because I know that it's an
artifact of my evolutionary past, and is therefore - statistically
speaking - highly unlikely to match up with the right thing to do (if
there is one), a criterion which is totally independent of what my
ancestors did to reproduce.  Remember, every human being on this planet
is the product of a successful rape, somewhere down the line.</a>

the *truth* may be that all goals are equally valid, but unless your

differentials into concrete goals.

<a name="2270qlink2">It's like a heat engine.  Choices are powered by differential
desirabilities.  If you think the real, factual landscape is flat, you
can impose a set of arbitrary (or even inconsistent) choices without
objection.  But we don't *know* what the real landscape is, and the
probabilistic landscape *isn't flat*.  The qualia of joy have a higher
probability of being "good" than the qualia of pain.  Higher
intelligence is more likely to lead to an optimal future.</a></a>

<a name="2235qlink4">When you impose a set of initial goals, you are either assuming that the
landscape is known with absolute certainty to be flat (an artificial and
untrue certainty) or you are imposing a probabilistic (and thus
falsifiable) landscape.</a>
