All:

<a name="2091qlink1">I call the essay Saint-Andre mentions below to your attention
and recommend you read it.  Since not everyone here is or
was an Objectivist (or knows about it), it might not seem all
that relevant.  But could we not this same logic be applied
to some of the various transhuman and Extropian artistic
endeavors?  I'd be curious to see your reactions...</a>

<p>
Cheers!

To: philosophy of objectivism  &lt;OBJECTIVISM-L@cornell.edu&gt;
Subject: "Artist Shrugged", etc.

<p>
List members might be interested in knowing that I have just
published my article "Artist Shrugged" in the Monadnock
Review; this essay is a radical critique of one aspect of the
Randian aesthetics and is guaranteed to enlighten, infuriate,
or otherwise stir you up.

<p>
Other recent additions to monadnock.net include two poems
by Moira Russell, translations by Leonard Cottrell of poems
by Michelangelo and many other Italian poets, translations
from Hebrew by Michal Fram-Cohen of poems by Binyamin
Halevi and Saul Tchernikhovski, and two sonnets by Tanya
Wendling.

<p>
Enjoy!

<p>
Peter
