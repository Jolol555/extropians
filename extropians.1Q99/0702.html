<a name="0704qlink1">Thanks to the people who posted their opinions of this film. This movie
was one of the best of 1998. The visuals were stunning, the plot
ingenious, and a number of very interesting philosophical questions were
raised such as: What is identity? and How do we know what objective
reality is? Like most  good sci-fi, there are things to quibble about
and many unanswered questions, but so what? That only makes talking
about it more interesting. Also, at 98 minutes the film is a reminder of
how overlong many films have become and of the advantages of brevity.</a>

<p>
Catch this one on DVD if you can. It's quite stunning and the separate
audio commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert and the director are
interesting too. You may want to watch this one three or four times.
