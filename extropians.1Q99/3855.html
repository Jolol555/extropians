There are laws requiring it, but it is not constitutionally based. There is no
guarrantee to a public education in either the national or my own state's
Constitution. This is one of those things that the statists slip in under the 'general
welfare' clause. Many state constitutions make specific requirements for education,
not all do, but not New Hampshire (note, NH has had its students score in the top five
states for average SAT scores, with one of the top five levels of participation by the
student bodies, while also having one of the three lowest per capita spending levels
on education in the country.)

Public education systems are at best negligent when it comes to the education of the
most gifted students. The phenomonon of 'ADD' students are that those students are the
brightest kids and need more one on one /self paced instruction. The educational
system is treating them like disabled students so they can manipulate the system to
get extra tax funding while they force these kids to fit into the mediocre average
education.

Yes, I was taught to read at age 4 by my grandmother. By 6 I was playing scrabble with
her.

'rigorous public education' is like 'military intelligence'. Its oxymoronic. Unless
you mean it in the British sense, where 'public' schools are rigoruous, but they are
far from public.

<p>
Bull. You don't need to know anything about anyone you went through elementary school
or high school with. I doubt I have even seen more than a dozen of my classmates since
graduation, and the 'socialization skills' I learned then have not been useful at all
in the business world. There is no reason why the public should be taxed so kids can
socialize. Let them do it on their own time.

<p>
Real socialization skills are things like etiquette, dancing classes, etc. which stand
you in good stead later in life, which only the rare school has.

<p>
They claim that all should have equal opportunity, but in relation to what? Their
ability to excel? In that case most money should go to the bright kids, not the
retarded kids. It is even worse when you limit opportunities for bright kids because
you want to 'socialize' or 'mainstream' them.
