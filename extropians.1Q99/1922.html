<p>
Due to moving ExI's admin around and changing procedures, we're way behind
on sending out membership renewal reminders. If you know your membership
has expired, it would really help us if you could renew soon. You can do
this via the web form at www.extropy.org, or by sending your info to me at
more@extropy.org  or by calling (310) 398-0375 (and leaving a message on
the secure machine).

<p>
If you're sending a check, please send it to the old address, since the
bank deposits are still done down here for now:
Extropy Institute
<br>
13428 Maxella Avenue, #273
<br>
Marina del Rey, CA 90292

<p>
NOTE: ExI membership is needed for entry to EXTRO 4. (See
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/ex4/e4main.htm">http://www.extropy.org/ex4/e4main.htm</a> for info). If you are joining for the
first time and also want to go to the conference, you can take $20 off the
membership rate (or $5 off the student rate).

<p>
If recent stock market gains have rewarded you well, please consider a
(tax-deductible!) contribution to help ExI pay off some of its debts. (BTW,
I need to check on this, but I believe that a portion of the Extro 4
registration may be tax-deductible. Once confirmed, we'll add this info to
the web pages.)

<p>
Sorry for the financial interruption. I now return you to your regular
programming.

<p>
Max
