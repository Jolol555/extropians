In a biography I read recently I saw a man described as a "lifelong
student".  It's very important to cultivate the habit of learning as a
lifelong endeavor.  There's no reason you can't continue to learn new
subjects all through your life.

<p>
A school environment can provide structure and motivation to help you
focus your efforts.  It's like dieting, or stopping smoking.  Some people
<a name="3724qlink2">can do it on their own, others do better as part of a group.

<p>
Hopefully we will see more experiments along these lines.</a>  Some colleges
<a name="3724qlink3">are starting to offer online courses.  It would be interesting to hear
if anyone has any experiences with them.
