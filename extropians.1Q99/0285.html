I bought &amp; read parts of this book this last weekend.
It seems highly relevant to speculations about the economic
impact of future techs like nanotech, AI, space travel, etc.

    General Purpose Technologies &amp; Economic Growth
<p>
            editied by Elhanan Helpman 
<br>
   320 pages, Nov, 1998, MIT Press; ISBN: 0262082632

Most economists have viewed technological progress as an 
incremental process. A few have focused on the role of 
drastic innovations - those that introduce a discontinuity. 
The contributors to this volume are concerned with the 
type of drastic innovation called general purpose 
technologies (GPTs). A GPT has the potential to affect 
the entire economic system and can lead to far-reaching 
changes in such social factors as working hours and 
constraints on family life. Examples of GPTs are the 
steam engine, electricity, and the computer. The study 
of GPTs is relatively new. A universal theoretical 
framework for dealing with GPTs does not yet exist. The 
essays in this book both further our understanding of 
GPT-driven economic growth and lay the foundation for 
further developments of the available frameworks.
