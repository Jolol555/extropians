<a name="3538qlink1">To build a nuke, you need either plutonium or enriched uranium.  Producing
either of these materials requires a capital investment on the order of
hundreds of millions of dollars (or much more if you want to produce it in

<a name="3538qlink3">expensive),<a name="3534qlink3"> and some special electronics (probably adaptable from civilian

</a>uses).<a name="3534qlink4">  You also need some expensive experts to design the things,</a> and a
<a name="3534qlink5">large test range where you can try out</a> the prototypes.

<p>
<a name="3534qlink6">Now, I'm sure all of these things will become less expensive as technology
improves, but so will everything else.<a name="3538qlink4">  If technology advances bring the
cost of a nuke down to a few thousand dollars,</a> that implies that prices on
other kinds of military equipment will also fall by a couple of orders of
magnitude.  That would lead to radical changes in every aspect of military
operations, which means we would need to re-evaluate the whole subject from
the ground up.</a>

<p>
<a name="3538qlink5"><a name="3534qlink7">If you are going to assume that future technology increases the ability of
the individual to purchase expensive hardware by three orders of magnitude,</a>
you should also assume that states get the same benefit.  What do you think
the U.S. military look like if it had an annual budget of $100 trillion
dollars?</a>
