<i>&gt; &gt; Not to mention optimism and positive memes. Have you noted the quite</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transhuman ads for big corporations on CNN and Discovery? Slogans like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "Let's make things better", celebrations of technology and human</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ingenuity (often done in a very characteristic surreal style), and my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; favorite:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We move because we hate the idea of standing still.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We create because we want something new in our life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We take the next step because we want to rise above.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; This is our mission, this is our passion.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Daewoo Corporation</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ack!  I *hate* these kinds of ads.  This kind of content-free verbiage</i><br>
<i>&gt; is becoming the new double-speak, along with "integrity" and "quality"</i><br>
<i>&gt; programs.  The are the new buzz words that can't be measured, and make</i><br>
<i>&gt; the customer feel good without really saying anything or offering</i><br>
<i>&gt; anything.</i><br>

<p>
OK. I see your point too. These ads are not trying to sell you a
certain product, they are trying to sell you a corporation (or rather,
make it look nice and worth cooperating with). And plenty of ads are
indeed content-free verbiage. The best ads in the category I refer to
are however not content-free, but the images and text clearly suggests
a pro-tech, optimistic and transhumanist view (such as the recent BNFL
ads, which show various applications of "modern magic").

<p>
<a href="1680.html#1695qlink2">&gt; Take the above example, for example.  I still don't know what they're</a><br>
<i>&gt; selling.  I just feel like it must be good whatever it is. </i><br>

<p>
(Daewoo makes heavy industry, ships, construction, motor vehicles,
electronics, hotels, well, it is a typical Korean megacorp)

<p>
However, note that the slogan is not entirely content free. It clearly
is anti-entropic and anti-conservative (whether the corporation is, is
of course another question). It is extremely general, but what else
could it be when dealing with such a diversified company?


<p>
<a href="1680.html#1695qlink3">&gt; The reason that these memes sound so positive is because your</a><br>
<i>&gt; subconscious fills in the lack of details and you think it totally</i><br>
<i>&gt; agrees with your extropian position.  A white supremacist Klu Klux Klan</i><br>
<i>&gt; member would probably thing that those words apply to him.  The words</i><br>
<i>&gt; mean nothing.</i><br>

<p>
Hmm, somehow I have a hard time seeing a conservative agreeing with
it, at least not without serious doublethink. Your point about filling
in is however interesting. 

<p>
So, when doing transhumanist advertising, should we go for the general
"feel good about our philosophy" (lots of dynamic optimism,
self-transformation and dynamic memes) or specialize at certain points
("Legalize germline modifications", "Upload rights!")?
