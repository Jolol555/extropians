Brent's interactive FAQ server is interesting, but I don't see
how it avoids becoming nothing more than what the list archive
already is: an unorganized free-for-all of everyone's answer to
some big questions, and lots of questions only one person cares
about.  The thing that useful FAQ lists have going for them is
that one person or a small group does the work of organizing a
coherent document, selecting the questions and answers that
really are most frequent or most useful.

<p>
A similar thing could be done for frequent controversies.
Collect and organize a good set of them, find eloquent advocates
for each side, and include brief summaries of each issue.  But
to be useful, it has to be organized and edited.  That way, if
someone wants to discuss one of these, we have a head start.
Maybe we could even number the individual points of argument,
like Westlaw headnotes, so they could be used to shorten posts.
Ideally, people will be inclined to bring up only new arguments
to the issues, perhaps even referring to them by number, and
giving us the opportunity to update them.
