Ah.  I see your point.

<p>
<a name="1173qlink1">I think, however, that we are still safe.  There are some formidable
problems with nano-scale (or even micro-scale) nuclear devices, and they
seem to be more a matter of fundamental physics than simple engineering
constrains.

<p>
First, there is a size requirement for the fuel.  A fusion reaction releases
most of its energy in the form of hard x-rays, which are then absorbed by
the rest of the fuel, which produces the heat that sustains the chain
reaction.  If you make the device too small the x-rays aren't captured, and
you can't produce a chain reaction.  Even with nanotech, its hard to see how
you could make a device less than a few inches in diameter without this
problem being fatal.

<p>
Second, there is a power storage problem.  Current bomb designs use a small
fission bomb to produce the energy that starts their fusion reaction.  A
laser ignition system would need a similar amount of power, but it has to
get it from a non-nuclear source.  That means you need a capacitor</a> system
much bigger than the bomb itself - and we've already seen that the bomb has
a minimum size.

<p>
Third, as you noted, there is a diminishing yield problem.  Even nuclear
weapons only produce so much bang per pound, and if you start measuring the
bomb size in micrograms it gets pretty puny.  A robot mosquito might carry
as much punch as a truck bomb, if you could make a bomb that small - but
that's no big deal with reasonably advanced nanotech.  Anything much smaller
than that won't even produce an explosion - it will simply produce a flash
of radiation when it detonates.
