<a href="2638.html#2681qlink1">&gt; Thanks Harvey.  There is a great book on this subject whose name eludes</a><br>
<i>&gt; me...something like the emergence of awareness and the defeat</a> of the bicameral</i><br>
<a name="2868qlink2"><i>&gt; mind."  I will search my memory and report its name.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What I do remember is the author's thesis that awareness first appeared in our</i><br>
<i>&gt; species around 1250 BC in Ionia and is documented in the Illiad and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Odyssey.</i><br>

<a name="2868qlink3">Sounds very interesting!  I guess "awareness" here doesn't mean
consciousness (as I first read it), but self-determination?  It would be
very interesting to see this book!  My biggest problem with current
society is that everybody just lives day-to-day, living for the weekend.</a>

You ask people how long they want to live, what they want to do with
their lives, or what they wish they could change in their lives, and
they look at you as if you're crazy.  They can't even understand the
questions.  They're not self-aware or self-determinate.  Try asking them
who made their life the way it is.

<p>
If you don't have goals set for your life, you're just driftwood in the
sea of humanity!
