Hello,

<p>
I have been reading some of this talk about life-extending technologies
and technological consciousness assimilation, and just wanted to note
that the approach that some are "elite" and "deserve" such "beneficial"
things would probably be the subject of a new-day French-style
Revolution and lead to many being "bloodily decapitated".

<p>
The Internet among other things has "levelled the playing field" in some
regards, that is to say, it has razed many "artificial" or other
barriers.

<p>
It is frustrating to be intelligent to the point where things that are
readily apparent to oneself and peers are not to the general personae.
Claiming "elitism" is a pedantic measure that is not auto-honest.

<p>
Instead of trying to separate, a more positive approach is to think in
terms of lifting everyone.

<p>
In the framework of "machine consciousness" and some future ability to
translate biological thought processes to such a context, there is a
difference between interfacing to such a machine consiousness and
surrendering your entirety to it.  Personally, I would not choose to
have my consciousness or a copy of it irreparably mated to a universal
<br>
"machine consciousness", but the idea of interfacing with it<br>
productively is certainly a good one.

<p>
Things sure have changed in the century, perhaps even more so in the
last twenty-five years, which is all I have been alive to see, but as
the old French saying goes:  "plus ça change, plus ça meme chose."

<p>
Ross
