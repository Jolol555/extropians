In response to my suggestion that religion is a bad thing
<br>
<a href="2313.html#2424qlink1">&gt;&gt; for you when you make decisions that are</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; based on a faulty reality. It is for us when your spirituality convinces you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that we are blasphemers. It is for you again if another religionist decides</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that your God is competing with hers.</i><br>
Paul Hughes told me to
<br>
<i>&gt; Speak for yourself.</i><br>
<br>
that's all any of us here speak for

<p>
<a href="2322.html#2424qlink2">&gt; Only I decide what is "bad" for me.</a><br>
fine by me

<p>
<a name="2438qlink1"><i>&gt;Blashemphy?  Who is speaking of blasphemy?</i><br>
Every single religion of which i am aware.</a>

<p>
<a href="2322.html#2424qlink3">&gt; You are confusing 'experimental' mental states with</a><br>
<i>&gt; religious dogma.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2322.html#2424qlink4">&gt; More importantly, short of this post, my own experiences are mine</a><br>
<i>&gt; to cherish in the privacy of my own mind.</i><br>
did i suggest otherwise?

<p>
<i>&gt; As I stated quite clearly, I do not run around and</i><br>
<i>&gt; proselytize those beliefs to others. In the spirit of transhumanist</i><br>
<a href="2322.html#2424qlink5">&gt; self-responsibility, it is my own risk to take.</a><br>
Absolutely. I would never suggest otherwise. And did not.

<p>
<a href="2322.html#2424qlink6">&gt; Whether I can hold</a><br>
<i>&gt; any particular and transitory belief consistent with my other knowledge is my</i><br>
<i>&gt; decision to make and no one else's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Who are you to decide my own internal states are</i><br>
<i>&gt; good or bad?</i><br>

<p>
I am giving my opinion. Nothing more, but nothing less.

<p>
<a href="2322.html#2424qlink7">&gt; Doesn't that put in you the category of thought police?</a><br>
Disagreeing with someone is not being thought police. Arguing is not force.
I am not going to come and arrest you if don't change your mind or anything
remotely of the sort. Can you see the difference?

<a name="2438qlink2">PS: sorry if my choice of words sounds like I am telling you to change. I am
merely strongly disagreeing</a> with you. And, while I have a desire to live in
<a name="2438qlink3">world where fewer people believe that omniscient forces control their lives
or that there is a life force or a life after death, I have a stronger
desire for there to no "thought police".</a> Vigorous debate yes. PC censorship
no.

<p>
cheerio,
