<a name="2036qlink1"> If the Fed loans banks unlimited amounts of cash with little regard to
the bank's ability to repay the loans, then they can fairly reliably
prevent runs on the banks before Jan. 1. But that strategy will probably
cause significant inflation, inflation, and invite a repeat of the kind
of recklessness that produced the worst of the S&amp;L failures, so the Fed
will be hesitant to act as if runs are likely without clear evidence of
an imminent panic.

<p>
 As long as the banking system is fuctioning smoothly and there is little
reason to expect more than a few days interruption in basic services, it
is irrational to withdraw large fractions of one's account, because it
becomes much less convenient to pay many bills if you can't mail a check.
<a name="2034qlink1">I expect that about 50 million people in the U.S. will withdraw about $1000
each in December, and that the system can handle that without major
disruptions.

<p>
 Consider what happened in the U.S. in January and February of 1933.
 With some of history's worst bank failures fresh in people's minds, and
with FDR's advisors clearly hinting that they would abandon the gold
standard or devalue the quantity of gold for which they would redeem
Federal Reserve Notes (which given the strange quasi-gold-standard meant
that dollars withdrawn from banks as gold would retain their value,
while dollars kept in banks could be expected to lose value), it's hard
for me to understand why informed people didn't withdraw all their
dollar-denominated deposits from banks. The attitude of the incoming
administration was reasonably public by January, yet there was little
panic until the last week of February. This shows both that it takes
pretty clear evidence of dangers to produce a system-wide run on banks
(evidence which I don't think Y2K provides), and that even then people
will wait til the last minute.

 Beliefs that are common mainly near market tops. At current p/e's, the

a close eye on 3 month t-bill rates, and selling when rates show a clear
upward trend.

<a name="2059qlink1"> Oil futures and other futures contracts provide as good an estimate as any

 This is mostly fiction. As far as I could see, banks paid lower interest
rates. I don't know what evidence you have of a "huge drain" of cash; many
brokerage accounts presumably ran low on cash, but I don't think much
happened elsewhere. And the Fed's "flooding" of the system was more
rhetorical than financial:
