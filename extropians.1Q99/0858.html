society were exempt from moral law;..."

Now that I've reread it I see that she's just giving her own
definition of society, but I knew I had seen something about no such

<a name="0935qlink1">Right, notice the wording: "no such entity". She was reminding us that
society has no independent, concrete existence, contrary to the hoary
fashion of reifying, and ultimately deifying, the idea. Encouraging our
tendency to "thingize" groups, particularly "society", "community",
"government" and so forth, has allowed the power freaks to get away with
murder (literally, in many cases). They know that most people won't take
the trouble to examine the fallacies to which we're prone.
