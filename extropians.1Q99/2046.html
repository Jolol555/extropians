<i>&gt;  who agreed with me, but I should point out,</i><br>

<i>&gt;  that it can be shown to equal any number!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>


<p>
It seems to me that throughout this strain people have been (perhaps
deliberately) applying the symbol "0" to different ideas, then trying to
argue with each other, using their own personal application of zero to prove
their argument correct.

<p>
Perhaps it would be best if we could agree on our application of zero.... my
argument was a simple probability notation, with the denominator noting
possible outcomes.

<p>
I'm not arguing the fact that theoretical mathematics deals with the 0/0
fraction a lot and does find answers, but I think maybe my point was missed.
0/0 is a nonexistant probability in premise based logic, so therefore it
cannot be used.
