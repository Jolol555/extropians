<a name="3842qlink2"><a href="3836.html#3841qlink1">&gt;It seems too me that one of the basic skills that people learn in school</a><br>
is:

it

First off, if a child does not wish to learn to read, then forcing the
subject on him will only cause him harm, and will certainly not teach him to
enjoy reading. I do believe it is easier to learn to read up until a certain
age, and I'll accept your age of 7 for the sake of discussion, because I
don't have more accurate information. It is my belief, and I think the
success of SVS shows, that if children want to learn, and if they have</a> to
read to learn, that they will want to learn to read. But they have to decide
when. I was reading at age 3-4, not because of school but because my parents
read to me and I wanted to learn it. My husband, who is more intelligent
than I am, learned to read between the ages of 6-7. He just wasn't ready
before then. But when he was ready, he did it, and he did it because he
wanted to.

<p>
What you say about languages is also true -- it is far easier to learn them
at a young age. But once again, how does this typically come into practice?
Not by them being taken to classes at age 3 to learn to speak French. It
happens by living in a multilingual household or by spending time in foreign
countries during these developmental years. Personally, I highly recommend
this and intend to do it with my own children when I have them.
