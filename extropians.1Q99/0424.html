<i>&gt;|Can you tell me how I can, in good faith, follow a moral code when I</i><br>
believe
<br>
<a href="0410.html#0424qlink2">&gt;|there is no logical reason to do so?</a><br>
<i>&gt;|Especially when nobody has yet even managed to come up with a logical</i><br>
<i>&gt;|objection to rape (which pretty much everyone on the planet admits is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;|abbhorence (sic)).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I suggest that the meme rules of conduct be commutative.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Commutativity: If the rule is "X shall not perform act P on Y"</i><br>
<i>&gt;        then also the rule "Y shall not perform act P on X" shall hold.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Simply put: "A rule apply to all in the same manner."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If you postulate this basic rule of commutativity</i><br>
<i>&gt;then you would conclude:</i><br>
<i>&gt;     "If X does not want Y to perfom act P on X</i><br>
<i>&gt;      then X should avoid to perform act P on Y."</i><br>
<i>&gt;      [e.g. to avoid retaliation]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Simply put: "Do not to others what you do not wish them do to you."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Avoid microwaving children. Others may dislike it and microwave you in</i><br>
turn.


<p>
<a name="0435qlink1">It depends on the rules.

<p>
"X does not want to be killed therefore X should avoid killing anyone else"
seems reasonable.
<br>
"X does not want to be tickled therefore X should avoid tickling someone
else" also seems reasonable, unless you consider that Y may _wish_ to be
tickled and in return is prepared to give X ice cream.  Two people may have
very different likes and dislikes.</a>

<p>
<a name="0435qlink2">I dislike absolutes in morals, as they frequently contradict situations that
are incredibly complex and do  not fit simple rules.</a>

<p>
<a name="0435qlink3">Thou shalt not steal seems reasonable enough, but I'd prefer someone to
steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving child than allow them to starve to
death.
