Did somebody say "link quotes with artwork"?  I HREF you to
<a href="http://just-so.com/">http://just-so.com/</a> (Just-So Literary Postcards), where exactly that is
already being done, albeit with classic art and literature.

<p>
I can't think of a much better way to spread a meme to another person, than to
send them an Extropian e-card. Would make for a good way to get transhuman
artwork projected onto more eyeballs, at least. Along with an appropriate,
uplifting quote.

<p>
I can set something like that up rather easily.  Needs a database back-end to
work well, though.  I guess I could donate the server space and db for it.

<p>
The hardest part, really, is to pick out which image to associate with which
quote, so they "click" together well.
