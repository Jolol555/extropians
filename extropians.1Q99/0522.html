<a href="0518.html#0522qlink1">&gt;   IAN: Why is it necessary to make a personal </a><br>
<i>&gt;   (ad hominem) accusation? I am neither aware </i><br>
<i>&gt;   of nor was I referring to the study you do,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and thus your claim that I am is a lie.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   What I say is based on something I saw </i><br>
<i>&gt;   on the program "The Justice Files."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   If the study you refer to pertains to modern</i><br>
<i>&gt;   times, I'd note that most raised as hunters</i><br>
<i>&gt;   live in rural areas with lower crime rates,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   so your implication that killing some animals</i><br>
<i>&gt;   engenders compassion for others could be false.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Having grown up in rural Mississippi I have observed the following:

<p>
Most people's houses contain small arsenals of hunting weapons - shot
guns, rifles, bows, etc.

<p>
Everyone I knew that owned a gun was almost anally obsessed with
safety when they were hunting.  Even Bubba and his buddy Clem
Ledbetter were very careful with their fire arms.

<p>
These folks teach their children how to shoot and how to do it safely.
 My grandad taught my mom how to shoot when she was about 8 or 9. 
He'd make her shoot at rocks he threw up in the air until she could
hit every single one (I'm not making it up!).

<p>
Hunting is a religion to these people.  Indeed, it almost has to be;
they ran out all the natural predators years ago - if they didn't
hunt, the entire state of Mississippi would be over run with deer.

<p>
Almost all of the gun related violence that happened around my
hometown was attributed to the urban savages with illegal weapons.
