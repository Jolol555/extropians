Hmm.  Depends on whether you think the 'empirical' studies are actually
worth anything.  There is so much noise in this kind of experiment that it
is very difficult to collect solid data.  I'm not really familiar enough
with recent work in the field to venture an opinion on its quality.

<p>
I see two big obstacles to be overcome.  One is the long-term testing
problem - one would expect the most effective methods of spreading a meme to
rely on repeated exposure of some sort.  The second is the ethical problem -
any non-trivial meme is going to have a real effect on the people who
'catch' it, after all.
