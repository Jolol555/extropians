But I am merely a minarchist, and I feel extropianism (with

I believe I missed this point in replying before. What's this about
including those who favor compulsory genetic engineering? I think you are
confusing something I said in the new FAQ entry about *technocratic
transhumanists* who may favor this. Clearly, forcing genetic engineering on
persons is not consistent with Self-Direction, among other Extropian
principles.

<p>
The relevant passage is in the FAQ as follows:

<p>
"Clearly some political views will be incompatible with extropian thinking.
That is one way in which extropianism may differ from other forms of
transhumanism. For instance, technocratic transhumanists may favor setting
up an elite group to determine which genetic modifications are allowed or
which are compulsory for the general population. Socialist transhumanists
would want to centralize control over all economic activity in order to
shape the future."

<p>
Did you get this from somewhere else that the FAQ entry, which perfectly
explicitly and clearly said this could be a view of non-extropian
transhumanists? Or were you just firing shots off randomly?
