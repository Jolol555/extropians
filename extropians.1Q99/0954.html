Implementing the ideal interface would probably take more work than any of
us have time for.  However, IMO we can get most of the benefit with much
less work.  A series of static web pages could display the summary info for
different scenarios, and a simple database app could store and display
arguments on the different points.  Someone would have to spend time keeping
everything up to date, of course.

<p>
Any other ideas on how to organize such a site?
