Probably the former - unless the mood swings are so large that they prove
impossible to manage, which is something that can only be discovered through
experimentation.  Of course, such projects are a lot easier and _much_ safer
if undertaken with the aid of an understanding friend or significant other.

Well, its critical to understanding natural intelligence variations (check
out Eliezer Yudkowsky's web site for some interesting thoughts in this
direction).  Certainly IQ can vary in kind as well as quantity - there is a
normal human distribution of cognitive abilities, and there are people who
stray from it to greater or lesser degrees.  There is a strong tendency for
the medical community to label anyone who doesn't fall close to the average
distribution as 'sick', and try to 'cure' them - never mind that I might
think I've got a good deal.

<p>
<a name="0905qlink1">OTOH, I doubt that such studies will have much relevance to intelligence
enhancement.  It doesn't look like biotech is moving fast enough</a> for that.
Genetic engineering approaches might require detailed studies of natural
variations, but they would take generations to get anywhere interesting.
Meanwhile, neural interfaces will appear in the same time frame but lead to
explosive innovation.  Once you can wire a computer into your brain you can
start figuring out how to use it do things for you - first math, then
memorization, then more complicated tricks.
