&lt;&lt;Besides which, I would suggest there might be some good
memes entangled in all those religious meme complexes; it would be a shame if
we were to throw the meme out with the meme complex.

Thanks Glen, you are clearly one of the most thoughtful and articulate people
I've encountered.

<p>
As a less articulate new extropian, non-scholar, non-scientist might I suggest
another reason to encourage more diversity in your meme set (Am I using this
word correctly?).  Having just finished "At Home in the Universe" by Stewart
Kaufman, I am intrigued by the model of "adaptive walks on fitness
landscapes."  

<p>
It seems to me that one of the greatest potential obstacles to continuing
evolution is the tendency to get trapped on a low (relatively speaking)
fitness peak.  A diversity of opinions would encourage greater exploration of
the available landscape and increase the possibility of finding higher peaks
farther removed from your own location.

<p>
All you extropians inspire me.
