Ah, I see.  You assume that AI must be based on neural nets.  Hang on while
I shift gears...

<p>
My previous comments apply to algorithmic AI - more advanced versions of
today's expert systems, for example - or to systems that can use either
approach as needed.  For a purely neural net system the parameters are
different - I'm not sure if it would transcend or not.

<p>
However, it still don't share our learning disabilities.  Check out the
links Doug Bailey just posted

(<a href="http://www.news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_250000/250343.stm">http://www.news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_250000/250343.stm</a> if
you missed it) for an example of modern neural nets.  A brain built on their
system can exchange knowledge with any other brain based on the same system
via what amounts to a direct data dump - in other words, you can copy skills
from one brain to another.  It also learns very fast - each module can go
from blank to fully optimized in less than a second.

<p>
Such systems may or may not be capable of a fast self-enhancement process,
but they can go from childhood to adolescence almost instantly.  Once you
get a human-equivalent version and teach it to read, it will be able to
learn technical skills as fast as it can process data (which is likely to be
very fast indeed).  Social skills will take longer, since you need
interaction to learn, but it will still be much faster than a human.
