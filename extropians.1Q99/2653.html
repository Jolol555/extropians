<a name="2657qlink1">made me laugh out loud by saying

<p>
&gt; As long as the Brits are... going to throw the baby out the window, they<br>
<a href="2589.html#2653qlink1">&gt; might as well toss the bath water with it too....</a><br>

<p>
Anyhow,  I said
<br>
&gt;&gt; Is free speech all speech which does not
&gt;&gt; directly aid specific acts of violence?

<p>
and mike concurred
<br>
<i>&gt; yes.</i><br>

We had a woman talk to us last year who supported Dworkin' s position that
whatever a powerless person (apparently this included women) said was
harmful was harmful. And the FACT of its harmfulness was proven by the
"victims" statement to that effect.

<p>
In other words, whatever I think is bad, is, and you have no defense
whatsoever and you will go to jail for causing me to say you harmed me.

<p>
This just about made me cry it is so stupidly arrogant.</a>

<p>
<a name="2657qlink2">So, how do we explicitly exclude from "violence" all notions of subjective
harm such as this?</a>

<p>
<a name="2657qlink3">Do we exclude people's "self esteem" and other such intangible's from their
property?</a>

<a name="2657qlink4">PS: I think these are critical issues for extropy as many of the
technologies which we embrace are already illegal, and their adoption is
retarded if the law forbids their free discussion.

I was surprised too, to see that this list is not wrapped up in
encryption/privacy discussions, as it was some years ago.
