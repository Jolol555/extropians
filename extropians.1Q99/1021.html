   IAN: When I hit a baseball, all of the (atomic) 
   objects it's a collection of stick together due 
   to the electromagnetic force that holds them 
   together. In the same way, objects like the 
   rocks that compose the earth are held together 
   by the gravitational force. While the electromagnetic
    force is stronger, the difference is
   only a matter of degree. So the proposition 
   that there is no "entity" connection between
   objects in the universe is manifestly untrue.

<a href="1014.html#1021qlink2">&gt;  IAN: And the "complex relational nexus"</a><br>

<p>
   IAN: I've made a crystal clear definition:
   "a 'collective entity' is the ordering of 
   individuals in a system." Clearly, the 
   ordering of objects, from atoms, to  
   amino acids in the DNA chain, to 
<br>
   dots in a photograph, define 
<br>
   distinct entity-identities
<br>
   that are "collective entities."

<p>
   Collective entity A = {RDIB}
<br>
   Collective entity B = {BIRD}

<p>
   The ordering of the same letters yields
   what are two distinct entities. Any who 
   disagree should consider that even the 
   slightest change in the DNA sequence 
   will result in a distinct entity. 

<p>
   These entities may or may not be definable 
   as "illusions," but we can measure their 
   existence just as well as we can measure
   the difference between "rdib" and "bird."
