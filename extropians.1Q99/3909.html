The point is to build a society that is self sufficient with sufficient resource
base to develop a viable long term population in a terraformable environment. It
is to provide a fallback population if the 'grey goo' scenario of nanotech causes
worldwide catastrophe here on earth. Current research is showing that Mars could
be terraformed to a livable open air environment in a century of work, and livable
in open air with merely oxygen masks within just 20-30 years of concentrated work
(giving a CO2 atmosphere at a density similar to Lhasa, Tibet). This is with NO
nanotechnology.

<p>
Orbiting space colonies will always have at least a partial dependency on earth.

<p>
Depends on what level of inbreeding you are willing to tolerate. Using one woman
and hundreds or thousands of fertilized embryos would be a minimum acceptable gene
pool, if that is all your are concerned about, but you will also need a good
number of highly trained people from the start to oversee terraforming work. A
Mars colony IMHO would be cheaper than an orbiting space colony, for the simple
reason that Mars already provides all the working mass you need. An orbiting
colony requires you to get your mass from somewhere else.

<p>
Well, men still are superior in mathematical/spatial skills, and tend to produce
far more genius intelligences. Women are superior for space travel only for one
reason: they are less prone to get space sick. However it has been shown that
propensity to space sickness is more a matter of the percent of body fat. Fat
people are less likely to get space sick and women typically have 2 to 3 times
higher body fat levels than men at a similar level of  cardiovascular fitness.

<p>
Of course, sending dumb robots to do the factory work of producing greenhouse
gasses and digging heat tap shafts, as well as refining metals and chemicals for
supplying a nascent Mars industrial base is necessary, but humans will be required
for several purposes:a) maintaining the robots
b) doing the big jobs of bringing in a couple comets a year for three or four
years to drop on Mars at the north and south poles.
c) oversee the nuclear plants that will be needed to produce heat.
d) developing in greenhouses genetically engineered plant and animal species that
can survive in a low pressure, high CO2 level, high radiation martian atmosphere.
