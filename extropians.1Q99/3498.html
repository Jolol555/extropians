<a name="3517qlink1">This list frustrates me. It feels like the sailors on the admiral's flagship
discussing geopolitics in the mess. Good ideas, but the Admiral makes all
the calls, and he NEVER goes to the enlisted man's mess.</a>

Yesterday, someone said that we can't be elitist and get anywhere. I agree.
In 1991 I cofounded Knowledge Adventure with the EXPRESS purposes of trying
to move the bell curve to the right for everyone, and to gradually undermine
the soviet gulag we call the educational system today. Knowledge Adventure
succeeded, and is now a big company inexorably eroding the labor/educational
complex from below. www.knowledgeadventure.com

In 1994 I founded Worlds Inc. with the express purposes of eliminating
borders, barriers to "physical presence". This was too early an effort, but
will happen when &gt;=256k bandwidth become appx 10% of the US installed base.

Also in 1994, designed hands free speech reco canteen sized full mutimedia
PC with head's up display (Mentis currently available at

In 1995 I worked with Stephen Spielberg to start the Starbright Pediatric
network. We secured all the partners, developed the technology/software, and
operated a 3d virtual world so that hospital bound kids could "go out and
play" even though they have cancer/severe immune deficiency/paraplegia etc.

Currently I'm working on AI based softbotic program trading, softbotic
accounting/tax management www.obvioussoft.com , wireless telepresence and
other stuff I can't talk about yet.

In my first post I suggested that this group needs to create a dictionary. A
dictionary is essentially a meme fixator/transmitter. It can be done
collaboratively, and eventually PUBLISHED. It could be "contributed" by the
list members to the foundation, thus perhaps providing seed money to get
this immobile vehicle off the blocks and onto the street. What happened to
the idea? Nothing...so...i'm trying again.

<p>
Here's an idea...once Geron, Alteon, et al get their age regression, and
others get their intelligence booster genes designed, why don't we
reengineer fleas and mosquitos so that they will deliver these genes whereby
the lifespan and intelligence curves can be moved rightward in exactly the
locations/population vectors where these solutions are most needed? No
cost...total benefit. Instead of catching malaria, bubonic plague, you'd
catch brains and life. Billions of free inoculations for all.

<p>
by the way, I am well aware that this is "crazy".

right?! Please excite me!
