<a href="2447.html#2492qlink1">&gt; I would be happy to prove to you, mathematically, why there is not enough time</a><br>
<i>&gt; for evolutionary adaptation by Natural Selection to occur without some</i><br>
<i>&gt; underlying organizing principles (like LAWS such as F=MA, E=MC2, momentum=MV,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.).</i><br>

<p>
Trouble is that Darwin, Huxley, and Crick et al. never said that force did
not equal mass times acceleration. They did say that man and all other life
evolved entirely without design from natural selection upon random
mutation*. Introducing physics is a red herring being fed to a straw man.

<p>
F=MA operates when a vase is being broken on the floor just as accurately as
when the space shuttle is docking with MIR. To call it an "organizing"
principle is just plain wrong.

  <li>  not exactly true as Darwin did entertain the possibility that what we know
now as the "central dogma" might be wrong. Essentially the central dogma
says that the environment cannot guide mutation - Darwin did not rule this
out and so was initially a moderate Lamarckian.
