     Damien, How do you purpose to "tweak" the universe without
     delving into the nanoscale? Do you know what nanotechnology is
     comprised of?

</pre>
<p>
Do *you* know what nanotechnology is?  You advertise yourself
as a nanotechnology enthusiast, so I'm surprised at your
apparent confusion here.

<p>
Your very own webpage states: 

<p>
    DEFINITION of NANOTECHNOLOGY: Technology based on
    the manipulation of individual atoms and molecules
    to build structures to complex, atomic
    specifications, by means of mechanosynthesis.

<p>
Now, Damien is discussing imaginary, hypothetical techniques for
moving entire galaxies around and changing the shape of space and
time.  Neither he nor I nor anyone on Earth has much of an idea as to
how this might be practically accomplished.  But this much is sure:
such activites would require *really*, *really*, *REALLY* LARGE
amounts of energy and would be carried out over *really*, *really*,
*REALLY* LARGE volumes of space, and upon *really*, *really*, *REALLY*
LARGE quantities of matter.

<p>
This puts it at the complete far opposite end of physical scale
from nano-scale mechanosynthesis.  For an example, our galaxy, the
Milky Way, is roughly 9,450,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
nanometers across.  It has approximately 200,000,000,000 stars in it.
Our own Sun contains roughly 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms.

<p>
Nanotechnology operates on matter one atom or molecule at a time.
It's, um, *very highly unlikely*, that nanomechanical techniques will
ever be used for acting upon objects at the galactic scale.

<p>
Hope this helps,
<br>
-Anthony

Disclaimer: I'm a software mechanick, not an astrophysicist.  I
cranked out these figures on a Postit based on constants published on
various websites.  If anyone notices hideous errors in these figures,
let me know, since I am curious as to what they accurately are.
