<a name="3720qlink1"><a name="3719qlink1">I want to create a school for polymaths.</a> Students would be able to choose
<a name="3834qlink1"><a name="3746qlink1"><a name="3716qlink2">modules from science and philosophy combining them in whatever way</a> they feel
</a>
<a name="3834qlink2"><a name="3716qlink3">appropriate to create an entirely unique and flexible course of study.</a> There
</a>
<a name="3834qlink3"><a name="3716qlink4">will be no set course length and students will be encouraged</a> to 'bring in'
<a name="3716qlink5">other areas of study and give lectures to other students. I would</a> like the
<a name="3716qlink6">hierarchy to be non-existent - all active members of the school</a> should be
<a name="3716qlink7">considered students. Obviously there would have to be some sort</a> of flexible
<a name="3716qlink8">awards system for potential employers but this will not be considered a
</a>
major factor by the school. That is to say, students will spend</a> their time
<a name="3716qlink9">worrying about their subjects rather than their examinations.</a> The school, I
</a>
<a name="3716qlink10">believe, could be self-funding by offering the services of its</a> students to
<a name="3716qlink11">various companies, organisations, and governments. In operation</a> it would be
<a name="3716qlink12">more like a ‘think tank’ or an institute of postdoctoral study but</a> I would
<a name="3716qlink13">like to refer to it as a ‘school’ and treat it as such.

<p>
<a name="3720qlink2">The most important thing about the school is that you should be able to
enter it from any background.
