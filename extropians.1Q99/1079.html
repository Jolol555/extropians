<p>
That might work, depending on how alert your neighbors are.  Certainly, the
initial dust would be hard to spot.  Once you start building bombs you get a
lot more detectable - you need macro-scale equipment to separate deutrium
from sea water, and probably particle accelerators to make tritium, and the
bombs themselves are pretty big.  The whole operation will eat up a lot of
power, and there isn't much to work with down there - again, no free oxygen.
Nuclear power would work, or a really big swarm of your solar collectors.

<p>
Hiding all this activity is a bit iffy.  The problem is you're burning lots
of power in an environment that doesn't contain any large, random energy
sources.  A good sensor network will spot you through indirect environmental
effects - your operation will have a measurable effect on ocean currents,
surface temperatures, local wildlife populations, water chemistry, and
probably all kinds of other things I haven't thought of.

<p>
No, you just need an early warning system.  Populate it with small (mm of
smaller) chemical sensor platforms (capable of recognizing nanobots), with a
network of larger bots operating as control &amp; communication centers.  You
won't catch everything, but you should spot a growing swarm before it gets
big enough to be a real threat.

Or the SIs are running everything.
