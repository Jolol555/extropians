<i>&gt;&gt; Don't you get it yet? Mass destruction weapons change *everything*. When</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; one person can kill millions, traditional warfare is no longer possible;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; you cannot coerce nuclear-armed individuals.</i><br>

<i>&gt;end of warfare, they just demand some changes in tactics.</i><br>

<p>
As long as they aren't used, yeah.  All of the tatics and strategy that you
are talking about has been aimed at preventing their use in the first
place.

<p>
<a href="3497.html#3506qlink3">&gt;First off, despite certain popular Hollywood themes, you can't</a><br>
build a 
<br>
<a href="3497.html#3506qlink4">&gt;nuclear device in your basement out of used refrigerator parts. </a><br>

<p>
Or a television set -- what's your point?  TVs are far more 
complex than nukes.

<p>
Nuclear 
<br>
<a name="3508qlink1"><a href="3497.html#3506qlink5">&gt;bombs are complex devices, requiring exotic materials and large</a><br>
<i>&gt;capital investments.  </i><br>

<p>
Nuts.  Not counting the actual explosives, one could build a
device for $10K.  They really are not complex, Billy.</a>

<p>
<a href="3497.html#3506qlink6">&gt;If you could buy them on the open market today,</a><br>
prices would 
<br>
<a href="3497.html#3506qlink7">&gt;range from a few hundred thousand dollars up into the low</a><br>
millions.  Not 
<br>
<a href="3497.html#3506qlink8">&gt;many people are going to buy one at those prices, and no</a><br>
individual or small 
<br>
<a href="3497.html#3506qlink9">&gt;group is going to be building their own.</a><br>

<p>
If nuclear devices (reactors and explosives) were in widespread 
use, two major consequences would be:  one, that people would
no longer congregate in large numbers in cities (or have to, since
power would be so cheap), and modern armies would be essentially
obsolete.

<p>
<a href="3497.html#3506qlink10">&gt;Second, bombs aren't much use without a delivery vehicle.  The obvious</a><br>
<i>&gt;methods are missiles and aircraft, but those obviously won't work in this</i><br>
<i>&gt;case.  Your 'small group' probably can't afford them, and besides they</i><br>
<i>&gt;aren't likely to penetrate an aggressor's air defenses.  That leaves mines,</i><br>
<i>&gt;truck bombs, and similar terrorist-type strategies.</i><br>

<p>
A small group which has been kept poor by State can't afford them --
a spread-out, high energy use society would mean that even individuals
could easily afford delivery systems.
