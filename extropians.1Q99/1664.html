I think you overestimate what is happening here.  Amazon.com has simply
pioneered a new form of borrowing - they are spending equity to build market
share now, but they will have to start making a profit within a few years.
Otherwise investors will decide they aren't such a hot buy after all,
causing both the stock price and the company to crash and burn.  Other
companies may emulate them, but they will face the same limitation - stock
prices are ultimately based on expectations of future profitability, after
all.

<p>
Jerry Kaplan and Bill Gross seem to be pioneering a new economic niche -
companies that make a profit by rapidly building a high-value customer base,
then selling their information.  This is really just a variation on what
newspapers, magazines and television have been doing for decades.  First you
figure out a way to attract lots of eyeballs, then you charge advertisers
for the attention.

<p>
<a href="1660.html#1664qlink3">&gt; I'm not entirely sure, but I think this is a bad thing, mostly because</a><br>
<i>&gt; when CF and complex barter eliminate the ad market and the equity</i><br>

<i>&gt; grounded in psychology (rather than a deep ontology) than our</i><br>
<i>&gt; current market..</i><br>

<p>
I can see how successful CF could make most advertising useless (although I
would expect press releases, paid product comparisons, and other modest
remnants to survive).  However, I don't see how any sort of 'complex barter'
system could even be competitive with a modern financial system.

<p>
The problem here is the same as that of translating between a large number
of data formats.  Barter is equivalent to directly translating between each
possible pair of formats, which is a O(N^2) problem.  Using money is
equivalent to translating between each format and a universal meta-format,
which is only a O(N) problem.  Using computers to facilitate more complex
transactions simply amplifies this difference by making N a larger number.
Besides, what possible advantage would there be?

<p>
<a href="1660.html#1664qlink4">&gt; On the whole, the Free Economy may be more stable than the current one.</a><br>
<i>&gt; High productivity does not destabilize the Free Economy.  Whereas with</i><br>
<i>&gt; this economy, once 10 million people can do the work of 100, the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; 90 million starve; only productivity-reducing innovations such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; lawyers, paperwork, the stock market, and Welfare have kept</i><br>
<i>&gt; us afloat so far.</i><br>

<p>
How does high productivity destabilize capitalism?  Very rapid change can do
it, by requiring people to shift jobs faster than they can re-train
themselves.  High productivity just encourages people to do something about
desires they never had time to bother with before.  Maybe there would be a
problem if we were so rich that everyone could live like a rock star without
bothering to work, but that's still a good way down the road.

<p>
IMO, the real problem will come when automation becomes good enough, and
cheap and flexible enough, that it is easier to automate a new job than to
hire a human to do it.  Then the connection between economic growth and
human employment will be severed, and the system is likely to start
producing unexpected results.
