Yes, I hear they finally called an arraignment for his case a couple
months ago...its funny, people who know a little bit about him either hate
his guts or love him, but when you tell them (the haters) that he has been
sitting in jail without due process as if he were in jail in Mexico or
Turkey for 3 years, they get a bit more sympathetic, and start to get a
minimal idea of who it is that is really playing hardball.

Yes, packet authentication ought to be established with the new Internet2.
I grant that doing so on the present internet would bog it down to
uselessness untill everyone can get high speed connections and the
backbones are increased by a factor of four or more above their capacity
now.

I'm not too happy with the Texas government at the moment, since they just
banned the use of Quicken software in state since it supposedly amounts to
practicing law without a license. (Texas also bans sale of 'cookie cutter'
legal forms in business stores, at the behest of the Texas Bar
Association, on the same grounds). This is a prime example of raw
mercantilism. I wonder what we can do to ban texas on the net....

Up here we have legal precedents that establish that anyone can be an
attorney (common law states this), but to be an "attorney at law", you
need to be a licensed attorney who has passed the bar.

Yes, while extropians are pro-knowledge, they are also for responsible use
of knowledge. We can't just throw our hands up and say c'est la vie! If we
are to rely on the market, then we need to take matters into our own hands
to force the evolutionary curve in terms of responsible use of internet
tools. We rely on the market, but don't forget, 'de market iz us!'

If you are not part of the solution, then you are part of the problem...
