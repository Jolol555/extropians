<p>
Mutations and noise, that seems to be indistinguishable. Can't parse
diseases. Colored cells seem to mean states richer than boolean.

<p>
Such things have indeed been investigated, albeit not under the label
'Life'. You might want peruse the cellular automata bibliography on 
Santa Fe's ALife server. The literature is quite huge, though somewhat
difficult to obtain.

<a href="0672.html#0752qlink2"> &gt; It seems that with a few additional rules one can</a><br>

<p>
Searches though state and rule space are not exactly unprecendented,
albeit the scope has been very limited. This is a question of
hardware, and time effort. The code is simply enough to write.

<p>
<a href="0672.html#0752qlink3"> &gt; nanotechnology that would produce physical automata</a><br>

<p>
Using cellular automata implemented in hardware for computation 
purposes have been suggested for more than a decade, by many 
people ('gene included). The concept keeps popping up frequent 
enough, but still not enough for the mainstream to perceive it.

<p>
<a href="0672.html#0752qlink4"> &gt; But maybe, these things have already been done?</a><br>
<i> &gt; </i><br>
<i> &gt; If not, is anybody interested in collaboration?</i><br>

<p>
Yes, but give me a couple of months.
