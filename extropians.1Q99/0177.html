<a name="0182qlink1">Humans, when they are first created need spoon-feeding.  They need</a> very high

<a name="0182qlink3">but at the beginning  they learn slowly.  It seems likely (to me, anyway)
that an AI would start off learnnig slowly and then pick up speed</a> as it went
<a name="0182qlink4">along.  Certianly, early AI's would learn slowly enough for this</a> to be
spotted.

it

<p>
<a name="0182qlink5">We also learn as fast as we can process data.  Admittedly we don't force
ourselves to learn as fast as we possibly could (most people aren't that
enthusiastic), but we still spend months/years building those</a> first levels
of our neural network into recognising basic objects and hte relationships
<a name="0182qlink6">between them and it's only years later that we become able to spot</a> the fine
<a name="0182qlink7">detail of the relationships and can make accurate theories about them.</a>

<p>
Admittedly, you could make your AI's backwards compatible, so that the
learning that and early AI makes can be uploaded into a later AI, but
backwards compatibility always slows invention - and neural nets may be
impossible to make backwards compatible (at least if they are general
enough).
