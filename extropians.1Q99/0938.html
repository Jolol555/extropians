<p>
Then you picked the wrong way to do it.  By current U.S. legal definitions,
I currently own more mass than you could dig out of any hundred comets (a
few thousand acres of useless swamp, projected down to the center of the
Earth - yes, I own the mineral rights).  That ignores the fact that Luna and
the Earth-crossing asteroids are much closer than the Oort cloud, and can be
mined much faster.</a>

<p>
<a name="0957qlink1">What impossible task?  You're thinking in 20th century terms.  With the
technology we are talking about there is no problem hitting an object that
moves at a paltry few tens of KPS, and one mega-nuke per comet is a cheap
trade - I can easily take out as many comets as you care to throw.</a></a>

<p>
Again, tracking every large natural object inside the orbit of Saturn is not
that big a deal.  Comets are especially hard to hide - an asteroid would
have been a better choice.</a>

<p>
<a name="0980qlink4"><a href="0914.html#0938qlink4">&gt; That is inconsistent with the concept of complete freedom of action for</a><br>

<p>
Did I say I was an Anarchist?  Governments will only be replaced if we come
up with another institution capable of fighting wars - either way, there is
going to be an Earth-Luna defense system backed by the collective resources
of four billion human beings.  Good luck - you'll need it.

<p>
<i>&gt; Any weapon</i><br>
<a href="0914.html#0938qlink5">&gt; you can build and use to defend against an earth-massed weapon can be used</a><br>
<i>&gt; against the earth, also.</i><br>

<p>
Comets aren't 'earth-massed weapons' - a typical comet might weigh 10^12
tons, while the Earth is more like 10^21 tons.  That's why comets are
relatively easy to stop.  If you want to use a really big object (like
Ganymede) as a missile a short-range interception becomes impractical - but
there is no way to move something that massive without releasing enough
energy to tell the whole solar system what you're up to in plenty of time to
</a>stop it.

<p>
Look, I happen to be in favor of expanding into space as soon as possible,
for the obvious reason that the world is getting to be too small a place to
fight on.  I am also in favor of putting a lot of work into design-ahead of
defensive systems, so we can all be as sure as possible of avoiding a
disaster scenario.  However, nanotech does not magically negate all
defenses.  Nanotech warfare is simply warfare on a larger scale, and if we
move into space it begins to look a lot like conventional warfare at that.
<a name="0957qlink2">If both sides have the same tech base, there is no obvious way to tell
whether attackers or defenders will have the advantage.</a>
