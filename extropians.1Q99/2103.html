<i>&gt;     &gt;Why is India the bad guy for not adopting the silly western idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;     &gt;of patents?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My emotions tell me your opinion on patents is correct but my mind tells</i><br>
<i>&gt; me you're wrong. ... [snip] ...so I must reluctantly conclude that</i><br>
<i>&gt; patents are [a good thing] too.  [John Clark]</i><br>

<p>
with our current system of software being given a copyright, the way
i understand it is anyone can legally develop a word processor that works
exactly like microsloth's with the exception that it cannot read or
write ms word compatible documents.

<p>
china has been notoriously weak in protecting intellectual property.  i
understand that the chinese are now taking u.s. software and creating
one-offs by changing a few lines of code so that they cannot read files
created in the original.

<p>
sounds like a great scam, until you hear that every chinese coder wants
to become the next birr gates, and consequently makes the software
incompatible with anyone elses.   china is developing a situation
where everyone flees from standards and eschews intellectual property
protection.  the utter chaos that will result will make them cheerfully hand
over a few hundred to birr gates for office xx slothware.  spike
