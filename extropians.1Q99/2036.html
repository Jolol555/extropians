I don't see why it would cause inflation.  The money supply would not
increase.  All that happens is that there is a transfer from bank balances
to cash holdings.  The total money in anyone's possession does not change.

This is a common response to hard times.  People want to build up a
savings "buffer" in case they lose their jobs or face other economic
problems.</a></a>

<p>
If total savings increase, this actually reduces the velocity of money
and can cause deflation.  People are spending less and so prices drop.

<p>
Some people have suggested that the opposite would happen, that having
withdrawn cash people would want to spend it, and save less.  This could
be either for psychological reasons (cash invites spending) or perhaps
to spend money on Y2K related supplies (generators, food, water, etc.).
It's possible that this would happen to some extent, but I would expect
that the traditional response of cutting expenses during hard times will
still dominate.

<p>
In addition, in any such bank-run environment, there is probably a
sharp fall in stock prices.  This is a great loss of paper wealth and
makes people feel poorer, which will also tend to decrease spending and
cause deflation.
