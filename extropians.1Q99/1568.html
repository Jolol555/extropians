<i>&gt; can only assume that like so many others you haven't actually sat down</i><br>

<i>&gt; with the problems of free markets in order to gain the benefits. Spam is</i><br>
<i>&gt; one of those problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I have the right to refuse to receive any class of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;mail I wish.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Indeed. Just as you can install a filter to delete spam. Just as you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; get an email account with an ISP who will filter spam for you.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Since the internet crosses state lines and national borders, the congress,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;delegating to the USPS, the Commerce Dept,, what have you...have the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;regulate (under the Interstate Commerce clause) commercial communications</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;cross those borders (i.e. the equivalent of 2nd and 3rd class mail).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course the interstate commerce clause was never intended to be used as</i><br>
<i>&gt; a general power for enforcing these kind of laws; would you argue that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the government has the power to ban commercial interstate sale of firearms?</i><br>

<p>
It most certainly was. It was meant to give the congress the power to a) tax
interstate commerce to pay for externalized costs which a primitive colonial market
does not manage well, b) regulate what commercial exchanges go on between the
states. Remember that most state legislators and governors saw themselves as their
own sovereign nations, and the act of confederation, and later the act of
federation was merely a matter of establishing standards of human rights,
interstate relations and trade, and relations and trade with nations not part of
the federal compact. They looked at the federal government much as many people are
starting to look at the UN and other international bodies, which is why the
Senators in the federal Senate were appointed by the state governor and confirmed
by the state legislature, instead of directly elected by the people.

<p>
Why the banning of the interstate sale of firearms is pointedly illegal and
unconstitutional is because it directly conflicts with the 2nd Amendment, with no
conflicts with other rights that are reserved. Spam, on the other hand, while on
the part of the spammer is a 1st Amendment issue, on the part of the spammee it is
an 9th and 10th Amendment issue of state and individual rights to privacy and to
the setting of community standards (i.e.: what 'disturbing the peace' means), so
such a conflict imposes a quandary which must be defined by the courts. The courts
have stated that spam is a form of illegal cost transfer, harassment, and can
amount to theft of electronic services.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1565.html#1568qlink2">&gt; But more to the point: why would a Russian spammer care about US laws? If</a><br>
<i>&gt; these laws are passed, why won't US spammers just move overseas to countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; with better things to worry about than junk email? Why will US laws do</i><br>
<i>&gt; *anything* to stop spammers, rather than being used to persecute people</i><br>
<i>&gt; like you who post mislabelled messages to email lists?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1570qlink9">Because the Constitution explicitly states that the feds do have authority to
regulate international commerce and communications, and to negotiate and ratify
treaties, the feds can easily put up outright blocks or merely  tariffs on foreign
spammers, on foreign servers, on foreign software companies, etc. to make them pay
the cost of their externalizations.</a> Foreign spammers are actually the easiest ones
to deal with when it comes to the government. Because the internet has defense
related capacities, the feds can also easily cancelbot foreign spammers on the
grounds of national security, which falls under the 'guarding the coast'  and
'managing and regulating the waterways' clauses of the Constitution. They do not
need any new laws to do any of this, they already have the authority.
