OK.  That's what I thought.

Yeah.  Its hard enough to figure out what a neural net with a few hundred
neurons is doing.  I can't imagine an individual human getting anywhere on a
whole brain, or even a significant subsystem.

<p>
I'm not especially afraid of a human who runs faster than real time.  It
doesn't make him smarter, and if he tries to crank up the speed too much
he'll go nuts from sensory deprivation and/or social isolation (or get lost
in VR, if you go that route).  It may make him able to do the work of ten
normal humans, or even a hundred, but that isn't enough to make him
dangerous to the human race as a whole.

<p>
That being the case, I'd expect the number of uploads to be fairly large
before they can get an effective IE cycle going.
