It appears as if &lt;EvMick@aol.com&gt; asked:

<p>
Why would one assume that nothing can travel faster than c except for the
relativity theory postulate simply stating so?

<p>
The theory summarizes what ``we'' knew about motion at various speeds in
vacuum and matter at the point in spacetime when mr Einstein formulated
the theory.

<p>
<a name="2272qlink1"><a name="2271qlink1"><a name="2228qlink11">If ``we'' could create a specific matter/space configuration with less
density than vacuum, then ``we'' would need to update the theory to
handle this new case, as it probably would allow for FTL motion.

<p>
As far as I know, nobody has discovered such a case yet.
</a>
</a>
</a>

<p>
Therefore, currently it appears as if nothing can move faster than c.
