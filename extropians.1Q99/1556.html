<p>
Well, yes.  My comments in the previous post really only apply to
human-level intelligence - I was trying to stick with claims we can actually
back up with experimental data.

<p>
<a href="1532.html#1556qlink2">&gt; If the domain is the improving intelligence itself, the problem may</a><br>
<i>&gt; never arise.  Any increment in intelligence, achieved by applying the</i><br>
<i>&gt; current problem-solving methods, may give rise to new problem-solving</i><br>
<i>&gt; methods.  I can't know that for an AI trajectory, of course.  My</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge is limited to a short range around current levels of</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligence, and the behavior exhibited here is that most major</i><br>
<i>&gt; bottlenecks yield to a very slight intelligence enhancement.  I assume,</i><br>
<i>&gt; for lack of a better-supported alternative, that this behavior is</i><br>
<i>&gt; universal along the trajectory.</i><br>

<p>
Well, if we're going to speculate I'd suggest a slightly more complex
picture.  For an entity with a fixed intelligence, working to improve
problem-solving techniques in a fixed domain, the effort required seems to
follow an exponential curve.  You get lots of big wins very easily in the
beginning, then the going starts to get tough, and eventually you reach a
point where any further improvement seems impossible.

<p>
However, this simply means that a particular approach has been exhausted.
If you have a whole population of entities with that same fixed intelligence
level, one of them will eventually find a way to reformulate the problem in
completely different terms.  Then you start another exponential improvement
curve.  This is where Robin Hanson's idea of IE's 'low-hanging fruit' breaks
down - it ignores the fact that breakthroughs are not simply a matter of
throwing more effort at the problem.  Finding a better way to approach the
problem is a matter of insight, not of number-crunching.

<p>
For an entity capable of improving its own cognitive abilities, this effect
might or might not yield fast open-ended progress.  IMO, the key variable is
the entity's initial set of abilities.  For a human it would still be a
hopeless task - I could spend decades optimizing a single ability, and have
little to show for the effort.  For an algorithmic AI the problem should be
much more tractable, for reasons you've already outlined.

<p>
<a href="1532.html#1556qlink3">&gt; Few here would care to speculate about ultimate limits that will apply</a><br>
<i>&gt; not merely to our first crude AIs but to the utmost efforts of galactic</i><br>
<i>&gt; civilizations a billion years hence.  What is any temporary bottleneck</i><br>
<i>&gt; on such a scale?  With time, and advancement, such things will crumble -</i><br>
<i>&gt; or so we believe.  But an intelligence enhancement is just as poisonous</i><br>
<i>&gt; to bottlenecks as a million years of plugging away.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Our history has trained us to find eternal bottlenecks absurd.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bottlenecks which somehow stand up to enhanced intelligence</i><br>
<i>&gt; are just as silly.</i><br>

<p>
True enough - the only real question is whether the first sentient AIs have
to wait for superhuman hardware speeds before they can Transcend.  However,
I don't really expect anyone who hasn't done AI programming to see that
without a lot of argument.  The human mind just doesn't seem to deal well
with this kind of claim - any functional memetic filter tends to reject it
out of hand.  That's why I went back to the basics on this thread, in hopes
of laying out enough of the underlying assumptions to show that the scenario
isn't just a 'Hollywood meme'.
