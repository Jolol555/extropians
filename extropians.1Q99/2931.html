Since 1993, there appeared several other lists on the
extropian and transhumanist topics, and a number of people
went there.  (see my list of lists at
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/lists.html">http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/lists.html</a> ).
There has been massive development of extropian and
transhumanist websites since then as well, so people have
alternative means of expressing themselves and obtaining
the materials.
<br>
Some people are only on extropian-select, or transhuman, 
or polymath lists.  I personally receive all, but do not
have much time, especially for arguing the basics.

<p>
A few hundred people is all a mailing list as a structure
can bear.  I am not even advertising or listing my Lists
page for the fear that it can topple the discussion groups.

<p>
If you want to have an active discussion forum with thousands
of people you have to do something special.

<p>
Did I ever mention filtering, alternative private moderators,
or anything like that?

<p>
If we spent half as much time on active promoting of extropianism
as we spend on debating issues, we would have taken over the Net
by now.  At this point, I rarely bother to share the proposals
even, nobody wants to work anyway (please tell me if I am wrong).

<p>
Do we want to make a social impact, or we just want to chat?
