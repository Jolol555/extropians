This brings to mind a "war story" my brother in law, (some kind of engineer
for General Electric)  told me one thanksgiving several years ago (maybe
ten?).  

<p>
It seems that GE. builds some odd (prototype) generators which are physically
capable of being "de-spun" from their operational rpm (several tens of
thousands?) to "dead stop" in milliseconds.

<p>
In so doing a tremendous amount of energy is generated in an extremely short
period of time.  This energy powers a laser.  A very powerful laser.

<p>
<a name="3612qlink1">It seems that a large aircraft can carry MANY of these generators.  They are
"spun-up" by jet exhaust....similar in concept to the operation of a turbo
charger.

</a>
<p>
A multi-shot megawatt (or larger) mobile laser?
