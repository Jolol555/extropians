<p>
What are the principles of good or ideal solutions?

<p>
Can a set of criteria be developed against which
proposed solutions can be tested?

<p>
Can a methodology be developed that enables individuals
to select solutions with a high probability of success,
rather than spend their time on "solutions" that have
little chance of being implemented, and even if implemented
are likely to cause further problems because of their
unintended consequences?

<p>
Suppose I have a problem with the "social security system"
I'm currently participating in. I'm dissatisfied with the
expected future returns on the money I pay into the system.

<p>
As a solution I could start a campaign to privatize the
system with the expectation of higher future returns. I
could spend a lot of time and money persuading people to
join me in my campaign. What are the chances of persuading
the politicians and bureaucrats in power to relinquish
their system to the private sector? How long might it
take before the system is privatized? And, once it's
privatized, what if I'm still not satisfied with its
future expected returns?

<p>
On the other hand, suppose I could find a way to opt out
of the "social security system" and set up my own "personal
security system." Every month I invest a sum of my choosing
to build up a nest egg for my "old age."

<p>
The second solution suggests a principle: The implementation
of an ideal solution is under personal control.

<p>
Someone may object, "You're not allowed to opt out of the
social security system!"

<p>
This suggests another principle: An ideal solution may
involve doing what most think is "not allowed"; what people
say is "not allowed" needs to be questioned.

<p>
But if I do what's "not allowed" I may end up in jail!
This raises the issue of risk associated with solutions.
What risks am I willing to take in implementing my
solution? What can I do to minimize the risk? How can
I achieve the best reward/risk ratio?


<p>
Tentative Criteria for Ideal Solutions 
<hr>

<p>
They are solutions to personal situations, aspirations,
or problems.

<p>
Their implementation is under personal control.

<p>
They may involve doing what most consider to be "not
allowed."

<p>
They provide the best reward/risk attainable.

<p>
They respect individuals and their property, i.e., they
don't involve coercion.

<p>
They should not cause worse "side-problems." (Analogous
to a drug such as AZT producing side-effects.)

<p>
They should be beneficial to others, particularly
friends. The losses, if any, to friends should be
minimal and invisible to them.

<p>
The losses to certain enemies should be maximal and
invisible to them.

<p>
They tend to increase personal power, competence, and
effectiveness; their implementation leads to more
powerful and effective future solutions that are
easier to implement.

<p>
<a name="3000qlink1">They need to be communicable and profitable so they
can be "rolled out" to create a better world, i.e.,
other individuals can be inspired to also implement
them to their own and general benefit.</a>


<p>
Feedback appreciated.
