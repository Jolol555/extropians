<a href="0475.html#0477qlink1">&gt;If we don't own our own bodies then we're slaves.  Who owns our bodies</a><br>
<i>&gt;if we don't?  Who's the master?  You're either a slave or you're not.</i><br>

<p>
Interesting concept.  You're still of course reducing the world to the
owners and the owned, with no room for fuzziness in your descriptions, but
that's up to you.

<p>
You still haven't said why it is 'right' that people should not be slaves.
You've just said that you don't want to be one.

<p>
It is an interesting point that you cannot make someone a slave who would
rather die than be one.  But then the majority of us don't fall into either
master or slave categories according to most defiitions.
