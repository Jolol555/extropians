<p>
Just because something expands when you heat it does NOT mean that when something
</a>
<a name="3873qlink3">expands that it will heat up as a result. You are confusing the chicken and the
</a>
egg.

<p>
<a name="3873qlink4">The universe is expanding due to the momentum of the original inflationary period
</a>
<a name="3873qlink5">exceeding the gravitational attraction of the mass to itself.

<p>
In the gas model you are using, the heat in the molecules causes expansion due to
</a>
<a name="3873qlink6">the increased velocity of the molecules increasing the pressure of the gas. This
</a>
<a name="3873qlink7">has absolutely nothing to do with the expansion of the universe which is mostly
</a>
<a name="3873qlink8">made up of nothing. The something that is there is at such a low average
temperature (only a few degrees above absolute zero) that it is evident
thatinfrared radiation (heat) is doing nothing to cause expansion.

<p>
You really need to go back to school and take some basic science courses before
</a>
<a name="3873qlink9">you debate any scientific issues here.
