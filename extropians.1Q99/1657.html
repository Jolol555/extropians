<p>
<a name="1677qlink1">A bold and challenging statement!</a>

<p>
<a name="1677qlink2">I wonder, though, if the reasoning really works.  If you are saying
that *because* algorithms, physics, and evolution have no responsibility
to their creations, *then* scientists don't either, that doesn't work.
Algorithms, physics and evolution have no responsibility, because by their
nature they aren't the sort of entities that can have responsibility.
They are simple, blind forces, natural laws, regular patterns in nature.</a>

<p>
<a name="1677qlink3">If we accept that there are things which can have responsibility and
things which can't, if we are to attempt to make that a meaningful
distinction, then the fact that some things fall on one side of that
line doesn't mean that everything will.</a>

<p>
<a name="1677qlink4">People can and do have responsibility for their actions.  Natural laws
do not.</a>

<p>
I've been thinking recently about Clifford Simak's novel, "City".
Although written many decades ago, in some ways the setting is compatible
with our ideas.

<p>
The human race is gone, having emigrated to improved bodies and minds
on the planet Jupiter.  (Today we might have them uploaded, vanished,
Singularitied away.)  Dogs are the dominant species on Earth, uplifted
dogs gifted with human-level intelligence.  (Actually, intelligent ants
dominate our Earth, but the dogs are able to travel to parallel worlds
and they run most of them.)

<p>
The dogs have attempted to apply their ethical system, which they have
inherited from humans, to the jungle.  Animals are no longer to live by
tooth and claw; carnivores are made to understand the ethical implications
of their actions, and are expected to refrain from their carnivorous acts.

<p>
Today, we set the bar pretty high for holding people responsible.
Besides laws of nature, we don't normally hold animals responsible for
their actions.  There are exceptions: our pets are expected to learn
some simple household rules, and wild animals will be killed if they
attack humans.  But most of the time we accept that it is their nature,
and don't expect them to have the human ability to make reasoned
decisions.

<p>
<a name="1677qlink5">Even human beings, in many cases, are allowed to escape responsibility.
There are a number of arguments based on diminished capacity which people
can use to avoid responsibility for bad behaviors.</a>

<p>
<a name="1677qlink6">It is possible that in the future we will change the world to one where
there are wider expectations of responsible behavior.  We might even see
Simak's conception of animal responsibility come into being.  It would
be a logical outcome and extension of today's animal rights movement.
With rights come responsibilities.</a>

<p>
<a name="1677qlink7">It sounds comical today to imagine patiently teaching wild animals
to behave ethically, but the greater wealth of the future may make
it possible.
