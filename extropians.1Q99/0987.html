<p>
brian, since you brough this up:  for years now the seventh day
adventists
<br>
have been trying to convert their retired church worker pension program
from a pay-as-you-go to fully funded.  this is an admirable goal for an
organization that predicts the soon end of the world.  {8^D

<p>
turns out, the standard actuarial tables have proved quite useless:
the church workers live and live and live, all the while cheerfully
soaking up pension checks.  (my college roommate's grandfather
is a retired sda minister, still going strong at 92.)

<p>
there is much debate, but the retired church workers have the following
in common:


<OL>
  <li>  the smoking rate is extremely low (probably &lt;1%)
  <li>  majority vegetarians, probably lower fat diet than average
  <li>  very large percentage anglo saxon (longer life expectancy)
  <li>  low alcohol consumption
  <li>  they live long and prosper  {8^D


</OL>
<p>
as i have stated here before, seventh day adventist is the only
christian sect i know of that has no conflict with the notion of
cryonics (since they do not separate body and soul) and are
very open minded regarding radical life extension techniques
as demonstrated at loma linda university.   the llu medical
ethics board is notoriously open minded.

<p>
<a name="1008qlink1">there was a comment by a jehovahs witness i saw yesterday.
that group also has the notion of soul sleep, but are less open
to medical technology methinks.  witness, are you still out there?
comments?  spike
