<a href="2373.html#2375qlink1">&gt; Since myself and many others do not seem to feel this instinct,</a> I think it</a><br>
<a name="2387qlink2"><i>&gt; must be more of a conditioned factor.</i><br>

<p>
Well try the same logic out in this sentence
"Since i myself do not have brown eyes, I think it must be a conditioned
factor"</a>

<p>
<a name="2376qlink2">I think that God-believing is a heritable neural module present</a> in the minds
<a name="2387qlink3">of the great majority of human brains.</a>

<p>
A module which evolved around 150,000 years ago and which served the
valuable purpose of enabling teleological reasoning (reasoning about
purposes).

<p>
I think myself, with no evidence whatsoever, that about 3,000-5,000 years
ago, either a mutant variant entered the population or perhaps</a> merely chance
<a name="2387qlink4">selective breeding in a small tribe (of Ionic Greeks for instance) created
an emergenic phenotype which lacks this neural module.

<p>
Those of us on this list who believe in the kind of extropy</a> that I have been
<a name="2387qlink5">discussing lack this module.

<p>
I think also that the majority of principles which I espouse follow very
directly from simply being incapable of explaining events in terms of
"spiritual" happenings, being constrained instead to operate solely in the
materialist reductionism space.

<p>
I think that we learn Occam's Razor. We learn the fragile culture of
science. But we are born either able or unable to use immaterial events as
explanations.
