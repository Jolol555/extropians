We had quite a discussion of this subject here (or was it on the old
"Transhumans" list?) a couple of years ago.  You might try hunting (ugh) in
the archives.

I think there are two questions here: (1) Do animals have "rights" and (2) How
should we behave toward the natural environment.  I've written a little on the
latter subject.  You can find a brief discussion of one take on "extropian
environmentalism" at

<a name="0340qlink1">As for the former, one first has to have a clear idea of what the term
"rights" means.  I find it hard to conceive of a "right" without an entity
capable of asserting that right, so I don't find it useful to speak of
"rights" in connection with animals that can't at least let out some</a> kind of
<a name="0340qlink2">squeak of protest.  However, with that first squeak comes some minimal
"rights".</a>  Ultimately, though, I agree with the second alternative you
indicate, i.e.a "sliding scale" of rights based on the sophistication of
mental apparatus and the level of self-awareness.  On this scale animals like
primates and cetaceans rank pretty high.
