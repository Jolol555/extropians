Well, depends on what you mean by nanotech.  I could see humans building an
assembler, and using it to make diamondoid parts.  With a large investment
of engineering effort I could see using nanotech for drug manufacture,
making novel materials, building computer chips and micromachines, and a lot
of other useful stuff.  If you posit some advances in automated engineering
and non-sentient AI, I could even see some of the more advanced stuff being
possible.

<p>
The big difference is that without SI, each individual thing you want to
make is going to take a lot of human effort to design.  A diamondoid shovel
is no big deal, but a robot that builds nukes would take a
multibillion-dollar research project.  That's one of the more likely
scenarios I see - a gradual transition from modern engineering limitations
to genie machines, with design costs for advanced products falling from
billions of dollars to nothing.

<p>
I would expect intelligence enhancement, uploading, sentient AI and cheap
space travel to all be developed during this transition period.  I also
expect to see a lot of military nanotech - but it will be nanotech with a
price tag, which makes it look more like an arms race than a sudden
cataclysm.

<p>
Now, an obvious question is how long the transition will take.  I can see
arguments for anything from a few decades to a few minutes - it all depends
on how hard AI and IE turn out to be, which isn't something we can predict
in advance.
