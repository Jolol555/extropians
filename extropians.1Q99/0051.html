Exactly. I personally have no problems with this, but I can understand
that many regard this as utterly weird, perhaps so weird that
functionalism doesn't seem likely.

<p>
I would say that one needs to distinguish between minds running in
permanent systems and minds that just appear without any
context. There will be a near-infinity of the former and a much larger
number of the later, but only the former are able to have ongoing
subjective experience (the others are single "states" with no past or
future, even if they could have memories of a past). But things get
rather blurred, one could imagine the whole universe, complete with
the history from the Big Bang to timelike infinity emerging from some
noise somewhere in a bigger universe as just a single state as seen
from the perspective of anything in that bigger universe. But to us,
there is ongoing history.

<p>
Egan has done some fun speculations about this, of course. His story
Transition Dreams is rather disturbing.
