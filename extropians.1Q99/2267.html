<i>&gt; &gt; Why is your position any better than the conservative desire to outlaw</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the teaching of evolution and limit teaching to just the Bible?  Is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; because you're belief system is true and theirs is false?  Do we really</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; want to outlaw the teaching of wrong theories?  Won't this lead to the</i><br>
<i>&</a>gt; &gt; State being run by Thought Police?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly. Freedom means the right to be stupid. Only by giving all the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be stupid by themselves can we learn what is true wisdom. </i><br>

<p>
Nice words, but other people's stupidities, especially in the religious/
political realm, will sooner or later negatively influence *your* life
as well. The very reason that you worry about dictatorships and
such is *stupid people*.

<p>
In the case of
<br>
<a name="2276qlink2"><a href="2265.html#2267qlink2">&gt; parents and children, most people recognise that children are in fact</a><br>
<i>&gt; remarkably resilient creatures. The idea of the brittle child is a false one</i><br>
<i>&gt; promulgated by people with agendas of their own. This is why parents are</i><br>
<i>&gt; given a modicum of leeway in the raising of their children, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignorance is always something which can be rectified. </i><br>

<p>
Yep, we surely do live in an enlightened world. Not! Either those
kids *are* influenced by their parent's drivel, or they are just born
stupid. What shall it be?
