Just catching up on mail after four days working on a movie...

As opposed to left-wing media distorting the truth? In my experience no-one
lies more than the anti-gun lobby... they have to, because they have no truth
to support their cause.</a>

<a name="2613qlink2">*Shrug* Michael's figures look silly to me, as far as I'm aware the correct
figures are around 100 deaths per year, not 1 per year.</a> That is, a small
fraction of the number of kids who are killed in swimming pool or cycling
accidents... and a small fraction of the lives saved each year by guns.

<p>
Anti-gun lies on this issue are well-known, with many of their figures
created by claiming that 20-year-old crack dealers are 'kids'. Yes, a small
number of real kids are killed accidentally each year with guns; we can
look at improving that figure after we've dealt with the much greater risks
from pools and bicycles.

<p>
<a name="2613qlink3">I just don't see this as an important issue at all, and can't see why anyone
would unless they're part of the anti-gun hordes;</a> there are far more
important things to worry about. That they choose to ignore these other issues
in favor of guns tells me that they're more concerned with their anti-gun
agenda than saving kids.
