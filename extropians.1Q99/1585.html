It made posting fraudulent numbers in the header an act of wire fraud, which it
should have obviously been prior to that.

Could you please stop LYING????

<a name="1589qlink1">I never admitted that. I have specifically said that email can be anonymous AND
verified as coming from the source specified, just a anonymous digicash</a> is.

Letting spam run amok is far more likely to trigger a police state type reaction
than the use of and enforcement of existing laws on these acts. We don't need
new laws, the ones we have are fine, they need to be enforced!

The ease with which you seem to accept your fate of being a 'victim' of spam
might be because you lack the moral integrity or willingness to maintain your
own level of honesty which would meet the standard that needs to be demanded of
spammers. Please stop lying about what other people say.
