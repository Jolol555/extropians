<i>&gt; Now, there is no good proof currently that this is the case, but given that we</i><br>

<i>&gt; the best fit at any one time based on our understanding of the Universe.</i><br>

<p>
Okay, but note that this only works with multiple or nested universes,
otherwise you are just postponing the question. It is possible that, in a
god-lacking universe, an entity with the ability to create another universe
arises by evolution. What we call the universe, could be running on a turing
machine in some meta-universe. (For an interesting fictional representation
of such a scenario, see Greg Egan's Diaspora (or Wang's Carpets)...I'm
thinking of something like this only intentional). If you propose a god as a
designer you must invent an entity. You must also presuppose *purpose* and
*meaning*. These are things that are explainable through evolution but
cannot logically arise from nothing. God *based* cosmologies are incomplete.

<p>
As far as God playing an "intricate role in the formation of the universe"
goes, there may not be much for such an entity to do. When you say
"formation", I assume you mean something like, "creating the physical laws
and constants". Contemporary physics has reduced this to pretty much
nothing. It seems an awful waste to invent a god with full fledged
intentionality just to cause some vacuum fluctuations to get the ball
rolling. Without inventing a god we actually have less to explain.

<p>
I look at the "Why does the universe exist" question as being malformed.
There is no "why" at this level. "Why" doesn't exist before life. There is
no intentionality before agency. 

<p>
Scenarios like the idea of time-travelling god-like-entities from the future
being here now don't hold much interest to me simply because they don't seem
very likely at all.

<p>
<i>&gt;  And</i><br>
<a href="2414.html#2429qlink2">&gt; apart from cosmology, I am sure that if we were to discover a God, we would be</a><br>
<i>&gt; able to find some use for such a being.  Maybe as a Universal Lifeguard to</i><br>
<i>&gt; catch any unwary posthumans who bite off more than they can chew (I TOLD you</i><br>
<i>&gt; we were too close to that event horizon!).</i><br>

<p>
Yes, you won't have much trouble convincing people of the advantages of
omnipotence and the like.

<p>
<a href="2414.html#2429qlink3">&gt; 2)  Efficiency is not always the most desirable attribute in any system.  For</a><br>
<i>&gt; example, sometimes power is.  I could have the most fuel efficient car in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Indy 500, but I bet I would still lose to those gas guzzlers, even with their</i><br>
<i>&gt; pit stops.  And what is an efficient use of time now may not be so efficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; under future conditions; that is why it is good to have a variety of</i><br>
<i>&gt; approaches to any problem, even if it costs you more in time at the onset to</i><br>
<i>&gt; develop them.</i><br>

<p>
Power is important, yes. But we're talking about the car that most
efficiently achieves the goal--winning the race. Power would thus be
included when necessary.

 
<p>
<a href="2414.html#2429qlink4">&gt; 3)  Don't develop a meme which masks the possibilities - I whole-heartedly</a><br>
<i>&gt; agree, but doesn't this work both ways?  I don't want to create a "God" meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; which keeps me blind to "Atheistic" possibilities, but I also don't want to</i><br>
<i>&gt; create a "Atheism" meme which masks "Theistic" possibilities.  I think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most important thing is to attach a "Fallibility" meme to either approach; no</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter how right I think I am, there is always the possibility that I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong.  The Tolerance meme and Curiosity meme would also be useful to both</i><br>
<i>&gt; worldviews; even if I am right, its okay for others to think they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; right...and hey, why DO they think they are right?  I think if we provide</i><br>
<i>&gt; these supporting memes, we have lowered the risk of any other meme masking the</i><br>
<i>&gt; possibilities.</i><br>

<p>
Yes. It's important to make a distinction between type of atheism. My
preferred flavor of this is "strong" vs." weak" atheism. Strong atheists are
the silly, unscientific people who try to "prove" the nonexistance of god. I
consider myself a weak atheist--rejecting the god idea but not positively
ruling it out. Agnostisism may be broken down similarly, strong agnosticism
may equal weak atheism.(Weak agnosticism being the  undecideds/noncognitivists)
I believe that this may be the root of the agnostic/atheist debate, the
failure to make this distinction.

<p>
I don't need or want a religion. Although I recognize a possible utility of
religion/spirituality for some people, I can get all that I need to fill any
"gap" that may exist, from science and art. When I discovered the extropians
(and realised that I already was one) and read the principles, it helped me
escape the nihilism that I was approaching. Practical/Dynamic Optimism
provides fallibility while still remaining constructive.

<p>
Using "religion" to describe gods arising via evolution seems to me to be a
bit misleading. I'd prefer more conventional terms. Religion usually implies
dualism, or at least ontological precedence.
