<i>&gt; &gt;Anyone who has flow in rough weather has felt the flutter in the stomach</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;as the plane is occasionally blown downward, and it is not unusual</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to hear of meals and flight attendants being thrown to the ceiling.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;A plane which noses over will also accelerate downward.  So there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;inherent contradiction in saying that a crashing plane descended faster</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than would an object released from rest in a vacuum.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: But your talking about (1) an aerodynamically-</i><br>
<i>&gt;   stable airframe and (2) an aircraft slipping through</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the atmosphere at high speed. The scenario to which I</i><br>
<i>&gt;   refer is the opposite, for the plane at its apex is</i><br>
<i>&gt;   demolished, wing(s) off, forward section gone...</i><br>
<i>&gt;   a junk yard at 17,000 ft that is not subject to</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the favorable aerodynamics you describe, and at</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the peak of its apex where it stalled, it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;   at rest, and thus has no velocity to trade.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Those facts exactly counter the counter,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   which was very logical to have raised.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1900qlink1">Not necessarily. A plane can be stalled and still be moving  forward at high
velocity. It is the angle of attack which matters when it comes to lift, not
speed.  Once it blew in half, the front section was front heavy</a> and acted like a
<a name="1900qlink2">lawn dart, translating its forward speed into downward speed.Calculate in its
forward velocity (probably around 300-400 mph) while climbing,</a> being translated
<a name="1900qlink3">over by the change in angle of attack to downward velocity....
