I've got bad news for you.  As a former member of those "highly-educated"
forces, let me point out that if fed the right lines, the army would most
certainly do this. :(  BTW, what makes you think that conscripted soldiers
are *more* likely to do this to their homes?

<p>
But they aren't going to be personally asked by Clinton.  If this was
to happen, it would be chain-of-command, all the way down.

<p>
You have no idea how strong the "follow orders" meme is in the
armed forces...</a>
