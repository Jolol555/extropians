Thanks Anders,

<p>
<a name="2222qlink1">How about the following scenario:

<p>
At some point in the future much of the human race will have their brains
cybernetically augmented and networked to each other and the internet through
a sort of wireless ethernet (complete with firewalls -- I hope).  

<p>
As this community of advanced intelligences expands and grows (like the Borg
with firewalls), perhaps including beings from other planets, they/it will
eventually understand and control Biology, Space-Time and Energy-Matter.  Is
this not, then, God?  If it is, wouldn't there then be evidence of his/their
nature in the universe we are now investigating? (since they control spacetime)

</a>

<p>
What do you think?
