  IAN: Talk about conducting experiments of harmful
  chemical and biological warfare agents on "civilian
  populations" is disconcerting to me and to us. With
  respect to new law 1520(a), what civilian population 
  would consent to such? "Hay New Jersey, the DoD would 
  like to know if you'd consent to some Anthrax tests." 

<p>
  In short, if any document talks about mass poisoning, 
  and in the case of 1520, makes no mention of consent,
  that is on its face evidence that something's wrong!
  Consensual mass poisoning is improbable on its face,
  so I doubt that context would explain away that law.

<a name="1350qlink1">  Also, having read a fair amount of Code, context is 
  usually indicted by references to other sections,
  a fact that can make reading some Code a nightmare!
  But no such references existed in 1520 (or 1520(a)),
  which, in context, suggests it was standing alone.</a>

<p>
<a name="1350qlink2">  But I looked around for more meaning of "consent"
  in the U.S. Code and I found a section that seems
  to provide protection (I have no idea when this 
  section was passed or if it's been repealed):

S 980. Limitation on use of humans as experimental subjects

<p>
Funds appropriated to the Department of Defense may not be 
used for research involving a human being as an experimental 
subject unless - 

<p>
    (1) the informed consent of the subject is obtained in 
    advance; or 
<br>
    (2) in the case of research intended to be beneficial to 
    the subject, the informed consent of the subject or a legal
    representative of the subject is obtained in advance. 

<hr>

<p>
  But this clearly applies only to tests involving 
  just "a human being," and continually defines the 
  tested as singular. A "civilian population" is not 
  "a human being." Also, the above applies only to 
  funds appropriated to the DoD. But most important,
  it defines "informed consent" as possibly only
  informing "a legal representative of the subject,"
  which takes us right back to 1520, which only
  required that "civilian officials" be notified,
  which may be why 1520 never referenced 10(980).
