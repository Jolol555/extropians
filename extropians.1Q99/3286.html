Well I decided to do some checking.  I went to the Forbes website and
did a search on the word "libertarian" and the result was a ZERO.  This 
supposedly "Libertarian minded" candidate does not have the word 
appearing even once on his site.  Well OK I said, what about some 
issues I care about.  So I used the search feature on the forbes2000.com
website to find the following:

<p>
Gun Control
<p>
   Forbes Position: ????, I did a search on gun control and the search engine
   took me to a page titled "The Steve Forbes Medical Savings Accounts"

<p>
War on (Some) Drugs
<p>
   Forbes Position - It is society's "right" to protect itself against
drugs by
<p>
   passing laws

<p>
Censorship (Internet or otherwise)
<p>
   Forbes Position - ??? - Search engine turned up nothing for
"censorship", "CDA",
<p>
   "pornography" or "decency"

<p>
Abortion
<p>
   Forbes Position - ??? - "Today, however, there is no doubt – medically,
   genetically – that individual human life begins at conception, and ends
   with natural death."

<p>
No, Forbes is NOT "LIbertarian minded", in my opinion he just another
conservative
<br>
Republican who plays kissy face with the religious right.  Just read some
of the
<br>
stuff on the forbes2000.com website.  

<p>
I can not stop anyone from posting a messages urging support for conservative,
republicans with anti-Extropian views however I will suggest that any such
post will be met with a response.  

<p>
Fred
