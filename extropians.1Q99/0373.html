    &gt;Socialism/Capitalism are both ethical/moral views.<br>


<p>
Yes, but they're also practical methods to increase the material wealth</a> of most
<a name="0390qlink2">people most of the time. The only difference is that one method works</a> and the
<a name="0390qlink3">other fails disastrously.</a>

<p>
     &gt;Do you honestly believe in objective, universal standards of right and wrong?


<p>
I passionately believe in my standard of right and wrong and think it should be
universal, other people have very different standards but are equally certain
they're universal. Everybody is certain but somebody, perhaps everybody, is wrong.

Good point, we'd end up condemning virtually every historic figure that ever
lived for some failure to live by modern moral principles, and there doesn't
seem much point in that. Besides, the important thing about Einstein was his
science, his politics is about as important to me as his cooking skills.
Likewise, whatever Castro's opinion of General Relativity is it would not make
him less of a tyrant.

<p>
As for calling those who advocate government "looters" I admit there is a
certain logic to it. However with the exception of the oddballs on this list
(no insult indented, I'm an oddball too) 99.9% of the people I have contact with
do believe in government, and I'm emotionally incapable of hating everyone I see
as if they'd literally burglarized my house.
