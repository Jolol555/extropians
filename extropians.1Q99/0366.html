But even if it is most of you (us?) it is still not objective. I think</a> it
is quite likely that Hitler and other fellow nazis of the time would have
agreed to genocide, murder happens relatively frequently so i'm assuming
there are is a sizable (0.001%?) chunk of the population that doesn't find
murder to be evil.  Rape, i might have even talked to some people that
agree with this form of conduct, and about 15% of parents worldwide seem
not to be offended enough with child abuse to stop practising it (this is
a wild guess/extrapolations from local statistics/rumours/easily
memorisable slogans ("1 in 8, etc") but even if this is out by an order of
magnitude, which i'm pretty sure it's not, it is still a huge amount of
<a name="0368qlink3">people).  So according to objective morality, do these people not exist?  
are they explainable as noise in the data?</a>
