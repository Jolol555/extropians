<p>
The unified theory he was looking for is in fact in string theory, more
recently known as 'M' theory.

Yes, Adrian, you must understand that to many or most people on this list, the
word 'god' is a null set or else triggers very negative memes. Most of the
highly intelligent people here on the list are rather tired of the old,</a> worn
out, childish schoolyard bully gods, as well as the simple-minded 'don't worry,
be happy' gods. While creating a more 'spiritual' means of communicating and
<a name="2635qlink1">understanding transhumanism and extropy is laudable, referring to future
transhumans as 'gods' is, in my mind, more of a hindrance than a help,
specifically because of all of the emotional and memetic baggage</a> that the word
already posesses.

<p>
This is why Vinge's term of a Power seems more appropriate, though it may still
have connotations with the nation-state use of the term Power and Super-Power.
Just calling them transhumans, and eventually post-humans, brings such entities
down to a singular, everyday level that individual humans can relate to, and
the terms are sufficiently new that they don't carry any memetic baggage.

<p>
Finally, if we are all to attain god-like capability, then such capability at
that time will be considered to be merely human capability by those people. It
will only be seen as fantastic and extraordinary by those who insist on being
left in a primitive state. We should not orient our view of such a world from
the primitive perspective, if we are to become the new gods...as transhumans.
The need for a theology of ourselves would only be useful, in my mind, if we
wished the remaining primitives to worship us.....which I don't have a need
for. Do you?
