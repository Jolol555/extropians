<p>
ok mike, however: the high exo kv that i think you are referring to is the
eris system, and yes, that was tested.  that system had a deployable
umbrella that increased its cross section.  the theoretical models at the
time predicted less than a 50-50 chance of a hit on the target reentry
body.  they fired anyway, direct hit, pop the corks, quickly pack
everything up and go away.  {8^D  to this day i suspect luck was a
big player in that event.

<p>
our current system under development, thaad, is 0 for 5.  {8-[
the next test is coming up very soon.  so, altho the dispute is
highly political, there is a lotta difficult science yet to be solved in
making a nonexplosive kill vehicle collide with a hypersonic target
out in the thin air... spike
