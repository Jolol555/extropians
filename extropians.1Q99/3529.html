As I recall, the reason the Somali people revolted against us was cause some
religious American army colonel wouldn't let the khat supply planes land. Some of
you may be familiar with this drug, it is a leafy plant which produces a
substance called kathenine, which is refined in Germany. The Somalis were all
apparently Khat junkies and needed their supply kept up to feed their habits.
