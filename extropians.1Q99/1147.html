Its been known for a long time that many (and all of the smart) high tech
companies hold back on introducing products to the market until the
processing power required to meet the performance specs becomes cheap enough
for them to meet their market price window and still make a profit. Products
introduced before their time are money losers.....This is the practical
application of Moore's Law to product engineering.
