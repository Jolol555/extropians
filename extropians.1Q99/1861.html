<p>
Yes. I don't know what the average salary is these days, but as I said
before, *after* they've printed all that extra cash, assuming none of it
goes offshore as most dollars have in the past, there will be about $800
per person available. That's it. Either they can start printing even 
larger amounts of money and risk hyperinflation, or they have to stop
people taking out large amounts of money.

<p>
The biggest problem is that a lot of people who have a lot more than $800
in their bank accounts are discovering this.</a></a>

<a name="1863qlink2">This leaves us with a choice:


<OL>
  <li>  Take out the money, have it all at home where it may be useful.
  <li>  Don't take it out, potentially lose access to it for a long time,
   potentially have the banks collapse and lose it all, if other people
   take theirs out.


</OL>
<p>
As I said, this is a prisoners' dilemna situation, and the rational solution
is to take the money out. And since we've recently seen similar situations
</a>
in Russia where those who took their money out did well and those who
didn't lost out, we have even more encouragement to be rational.
