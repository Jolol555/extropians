<p>
I read the second, "Beggars and Choosers".

<p>
Sounds like my reaction too - not bad, but didn't excite me. In
"Beggars and Choosers" the supersleepless (the really smart
descendants of the sleepless) actually do something that might be
called quite libertarian, but it was a somewhat quick ending of the
book.

<p>
The best thing was the brief description of how tricky these
supersmart people were to deal with - they made obscure academic
four-way puns as part of their equally obscure research, leaving the
protagonist completely in the dust. At the same time their secret plan
could likely have been implemented in a much neater way.
