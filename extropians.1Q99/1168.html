Hi Ian,

<p>
You wrote,

<p>
<a href="1135.html#1168qlink1">&gt;This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1996. Why would</a><br>
<i>&gt;federal law define a right for the DoD to "conduct any</i><br>
<i>&gt;test or experiment involving the use of any chemical</i><br>
<i>&gt;or biological agent on civilian populations" (granted</i><br>
<i>&gt;a few officials know) if no such tests and experiments</i><br>
<i>&gt;were planned? It stands to reason that they are planned!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Is this connected to reports of sickening USAF-jet-spray?</i><br>
etc.

<p>
The feds and the DOD consider themselves the world's real people and the
civilization that the rest of us must work, pay taxes, and die to serve,
provide, and protect. IOW, the feds and the DOD (and their families) see
everyone else as expendable accomplices or outright adversaries.
Ever has humanity organized itself so.

<p>
We "civilian populations" don't count for much in the great scheme of the
political power broker's paradigm. Realizing this, we turn to each other to
reaffirm our own worth. In doing so, we infrequently identify one of
surpassing merit, such as an enlightened master, who places most value not
on Machievellian machinations, but rather on liberating meditations.

<p>
"Civilian officials" (whatever that means) probably identify more with
officialdom than with civility. It makes me happy to see that you've noticed
the corruption raging through governments. No doubt you've heard that "power
corrupts". It does not. Corrupt people seek power.

<p>
Inevitably, governments (like crimes, poverty-stricken classes, and gang
wars) emerge from the social organization of human affairs. IMO, the human
race will learn to transcend government, while retaining the benefits of
social interaction (as on the Net) or it will commit global suicide.

<p>
Namaste,

<p>
