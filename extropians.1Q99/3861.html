In the coin toss and similar experiments where uncertainty is caused by
lack of complete information, there are commonly accepted principles for
computing a probability distribution on the outcome and for updating the
distribution as new information arises. I am looking for similar
principles for cases where uncertainty is caused by lack of computational
resources (or better yet a combination of both), and arguments that these
principles are reasonable. I was hoping a systematic treatment of this
subject already exists, but since nobody referenced one it probably
doesn't exist yet.

<p>
Most people seem to assume that probability theory is sufficient to handle
computational uncertainty. I don't really disagree, but would like to see
some kind of formal argument that the approach is consistent and won't
lead to subtle paradoxes.
