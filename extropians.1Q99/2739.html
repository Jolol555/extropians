You can always tell the children about those little evil creatures living
in the dirt; they will sneak into your body, make you sick and even _kill_
you if you don't fight them off.

<p>
"Those creatures will try to steal our food. They don't like to the cold,
so put the milk into the fridge or they will make it sour."

<p>
Show them some dirt stuff in a microscope: you have educated them about
the world and seeing lots of small creatures crawling around makes quite
a lesson...  &gt;YEACH!&lt;

<p>
Kids are not stupid, just underinformed.
