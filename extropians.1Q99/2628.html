You must have missed the beginning of this thread.  I was talking to
Mike Lorrey, not EvMick.  EvMick was merely quoting my comments.  (I'm
just keeping the attributions correct.)

<p>
Mike made the original claim that I must be listening to Left Wing
propoganda if I believed more than 31 children had been accidentally
shot to death in 35 years.  He said that the radio he listened to
supported his numbers instead of mine.  I showed him stats from pro-gun
sites supporting my numbers, and suggested that it might be he who was
listening to misleading media.  I was merely quoting his own words back
at him.

<p>
Finally, I have not been quoting anti-gun propoganda.  My posts have all
along been saying that the number of children accidentally shot to death
is very low compared to other threats.  Just not as low as Mike stated.
When I posted the more accurate figures, I repeated that these figures
still supported Mike's point.

<p>
<a href="2616.html#2628qlink2">&gt; Your figures, incidentally, had one year when 34 kids under 5 were </a><br>
<i>&gt; accidentally shot and killed; I couldn't tell from Mike's message whether</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2644qlink1">Mike claimed 31 kids in 35 years.

<p>
<a name="2811qlink1">But seriously, how did you extract that number above while ignoring the
rest of my sentence?  The sentence you are quoting had 34 kids under age
5, 56 children aged 5-9, and 146 children aged 10-14.</a>  That's 236 kids,
<a name="2811qlink2">not the 34 you are quoting.</a></a>
