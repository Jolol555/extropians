<p>
Both countries in question did at least as well economically without patents
as 
<br>
either before or after.  As to why they switched back, my source attributed 
that to political pressure by large corporations - internal for Switzerland
and external for the Netherlands.  Restoring patents didn't improve innovation
measurably in either country.

<p>
<a href="2183.html#2188qlink9">&gt;I would also imagine that those countries started seeing a lack of imports of</a><br>
new
<br>
<a href="2183.html#2188qlink10">&gt;technology, as companies were afraid of firms in those countries steal their</a><br>

I
<br>

<a href="2183.html#2188qlink11">&gt;anywhere near their potential. </a><br>

<p>
India has many things holding it back, including tarriff, extensive
regulations,
<br>
and mediocre education.  They have improved some of the other things but not
changed their patent laws and, for the last couple years, managed a
respectable
<br>
growth rate.  

<p>
Ideally your controls for with-patent and without-patent comparisons should
be as close as possible.  A single country that shifts from patents to no
patents
<br>
and then back again is a much better (although still flawed) comparison than
two very different countries.

<i>&gt;Their GDP has stagnated and unemployment is now 1/3</i><br>
<a href="2183.html#2188qlink12">&gt;of the population. They are an economic basketcase. China is enough better</a><br>
that
<br>
<a href="2183.html#2188qlink13">&gt;they have a useful system, even though to get patent protection it costs a</a><br>
lot of
<br>
<i>&gt;money in bribes... </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;From my understanding of the Chinese bribery system, you can't call that a </i><br>
"patent system".  If you have enough money and the right friends, you can buy 
a monopoly.  You needn't have actually developed it.

<a href="2183.html#2188qlink14">&gt;The so called 'pirate software' industry is mostly just a</a><br>
<i>&gt;scheme by which large software producers can avoid taxes....</i><br>

<p>
They don't pay royalties to developers either.  When people can buy newly
issued games for 3$ in Malaysia when the official price is $60 the royalties
count more than the taxes even at a European VAT rate.
