  IAN: Good point, however, a possibility could be
  (just speculation backed with no known research)
  that our cities are more violence since they are
  not homogenous cultures, that is, the U.S. is a
  classic "melting pot," and urban communities in
  the U.S. are quite often divided by voluntary
  selection into ethnic areas. In areas with 
  multiple cultures, or "gangs," we tend to 
  see more aggression. Look at the problems
  in India between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs,
  look at Yugoslavia, look at East L.A.'s gangs.
  But look a Japan, a monoculture with low crime.
