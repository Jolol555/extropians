<a name="0037qlink1">hello extropians...i have been on the list before and now
happily rejoined to the stimulating discussion here, and 
have a question that i was curious about about extropianism...


<p>
does the singularity involve uploading people's emotional
and spiritual lives? as these seem to me to be as important
to the human organism as its mind...or is everything conceived
 as neurological, and therefore an extension of the
western psychological paradigm of freud?...this question is 
asked for information only...not meant confrontationally to 
</a>the list...

<p>
i receive the list in digest form, so may be slow in replying...
