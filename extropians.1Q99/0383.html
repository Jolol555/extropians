<i>&gt; &gt;I used to say that I was an atheist, but I've changed my mind and now</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'm just an agnostic. This is partly because of the possibility that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;our world is a simulation; the posthumans running the simulation</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;could well be said to be gods.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I doubt it, at least not in any sense of deity recognized by modern</i><br>
<i>&gt; theologians (although it might fit with the plural and anthropomorphic gods</i><br>
<i>&gt; of Greek, Roman and Norse mythology, not to mention Xena and a lot of Star</i><br>
<i>&gt; Trek eps).  If you build a snazzy alife sim and its GAs construct</i><br>
<i>&gt; intelligent CAs, you'd be a kind of bridging `first cause', and might even</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the power to intervene in their lives - even obliterate their entire</i><br>
<i>&gt; experienced cosmos - but that wouldn't make you a god in any interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; sense.  Gods are ontologically distinct from creatures, or they're not</i><br>
<i>&gt; worth the paper they're written on.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;There is also the possibility</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that all possible worlds exist; then gods would exist since there are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;gods in some possible worlds. Or if the universe is spatially</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;infinite, which it is on the simplest topology if it is open (which</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;it seems to be) then random fluctuations should lead to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;existence of godlike physical creatures somewhere (but would these</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be real gods?).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, I think this is an abuse of language.  In an infinite universe there</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be very powerful beings by that path; there could not (I think, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; my set theory isn't remotely up to this) be a quantum fluctuation that</i><br>
<i>&gt; yielded an infinite volitional entity coextensive with *all* those infinite</i><br>
<i>&gt; worlds.  And even with Gott-like (ha) closed timelike curves, I doubt that</i><br>
<i>&gt; there could be a fluctuation that took the form of the logically earliest</i><br>
<i>&gt; volitional entity that *preceded* itself and its own ontic context (unless</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is the universe in toto).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Moreover, I suspect this line of thought is self-refuting: shouldn't there</i><br>
<i>&gt; also be (1) an *infinite* number of distinct gods so produced; and (b) at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least one catastrophic transcendental event, perhaps accidental, perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; done by a Mad Mind, that obliterates all these infinite universes?  Or</i><br>
<i>&gt; would such obliteration, like a vacuum catastrophe, have to proceed from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; center outward at the speed of light?  If so, any god postulated as its</i><br>
<i>&gt; cause is crucially limited, and fails the definition accepted by most</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Western) theists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;And there is the possibility that there might be a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;kind of neoplatonistic god, a "creative principle" which might</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;explain why the world exists (though I think that looks highly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;problematic).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This sounds something like the array of current sub-theological</i><br>
<i>&gt; representations of deity (as far as I know; I'm hardly an expert in gods)</i><br>
<i>&gt; that is adduced by scientists such as, say, Paul Davies.  I don't see how</i><br>
<i>&gt; it makes sense as a proposition (so I guess I'm a noncognitivist in Max's</i><br>
<i>&gt; terms, although it sounds like a nasty label to accept), but that might be</i><br>
<i>&gt; a limitation of imagination.</i><br>

After reading "Superior Beings:If They Exist, How Would We Know?:Game
Theoretic Implications on Omniscience, Omnipotence, Immortality and
Incomprehensibility" by Steven J. Brams, I became a retired agnostic (I
don't know, and don't give a tinker's damn anymore, because it's not
relevant to this life I live here and now with others in a common
world).
