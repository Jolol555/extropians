Witness the outpouring of lawsuits being filed by Democratic
Party controlled city and county governments against the gun
manufacturers for the 'costs' imposed by the use of guns in
their cities where guns are already illegal (and have the
highest crime rates). It looks like the final push is on,
folks.

<p>
They ignore the fact that this will make it impossible for
the poor and working class folks to afford to protect
themselves, while the rich can easily afford firearms even
at such inflated prices. Thus the Democrats are favoring the
rich and penalizing the poor, an interesting turnaround. The
dems want this especially because they need a new lever to
keep the poor imprisoned in the grips of the Democratic
Party political machine, which still controls most big
cities, now that welfare reform is allowing the poor and
minorities to escape the bounds of the ghetto.

Paul's Response:

<p>
At the risk of oversimplifying things, I'd like</a> to add to
your sentiments by saying that ultimately all laws,
advertently or inadvertently, end up hurting the poor and
helping the rich.   Which ironically is a growing sentiment
of hip laws students at Ivy league schools!  A nagging
feeling that has continued to grow for me, is that the
entire legal system (at least in the US) is increasingly
becoming a complete joke perpetrated on the rest of us as a
smokescreen to benefit the corporate interests of the rich
at the expense of everyone else.  The gun control issue is
the latest to magnify this effect.  I'm therefore not
surprised that the Democratic party is behind this.
Although they have operated on the pretense that they are
the common person's party, their actions have spoken
otherwise:

institutes their own pupppet-dictators and righ-wing
governments.</a>

<p>
<a name="1622qlink3">A Democratic run CIA floods the country in question with
<br>
'free' grain and foodstuffs, thereby putting all of the<br>
local farmers out of business.</a>

<p>

controls the country.
