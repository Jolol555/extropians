I agree with Hal; I think it's easy to find an optimal moral code once you 
make some basic decisions as to what you regard as a good outcome, but you 
can't say that one moral system is objectively better than another because
you have to make those initial subjective decisions.</a> 

<p>
For example, I think that taking a short-term loss to make a long-term gain 
is better than taking a short-term gain for a long-term loss, which is one 
reason why I think that libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism are much 
better than authoritarian systems; limited government can't stop people
starving in the streets, but it can't lock you all up in concentration
camps either. But that doesn't mean that I'd be able to prove that 
they're objectively better than socialism, unless the others also agree
with my underlying subjective choices.
