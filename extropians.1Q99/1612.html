<p>
Thanks for posting this.  Two of the contributing authors are extropians
<br>
(McElroy and Presley). I haven't read it yet, but it looks good.<br>

<p>
Although it is not currently PC to be a feminist, it is important to
recognize the feminist movement. Most of the press comes from a few schools
of feminism (such as National Organization of Women and Religious Right
Feminists) that are reactionary rather than progressive.  

<p>
<a name="1628qlink1">There are many contemporary closet feminists who are very extropic in their
thinking but do not embrace transhumanism as a social enticement.</a>

<p>
In the new culture of Hip-Hop feminism, a sense of balance can be heard in
female rap sounds. These females are progressive by using their voices for
storytelling, and using  their platform for making their own deals and/or
owning music business, studio, record co., talent agency.

<p>
Rand would not have been a good candidate for some of the feminist profiles
<br>
(moralistic religious, dyke man-beating, female affirmative action,<br>
grrls-support-system, or lesbian media-monger), but would have gained much
credence as one who fought for individuality, success, and big emphasis on
merit. 

<p>
Looking back over the centuries of feminism, it has failed in part.  It
seems to lack kindness and compassion, affection and gentility -- qualities
that are lovable in a person and people.
