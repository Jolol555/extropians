At 05:17 PM 2/16/99 +1100, Time Bates  falsely claimed:

<p>
<a href="1902.html#1905qlink1">&gt;&gt;Anyway, the point is that the jet shot up like </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you throw a ball up, and reached a peak, would be </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;at rest there, and then fell. That's the CIA scenario.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think their movie shows the plane exploding downward like a rocket. In </i><br>
<i>&gt;other words it didn't reach appogee and turnover like an albatross, it </i><br>
<i>&gt;was being thrust violently upwards under full throttle, suffered an </i><br>
<i>&gt;alteration in attitude due to its own fuel exploding and then rapidly </i><br>
<i>&gt;accelerated towrad the earth, continuing some thrust and much burn.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also, it is quite inappropriate to translate their about x seconds and </i><br>
<i>&gt;"about a mile" 6 </i><br>
<i>&gt;o'clock news commentary into a calculus of precise feet and seconds.</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: You obviously havn't listend to the 
  video long enough to hear exactly this:


<p>
"Just after the aircraft exploded it pitched up abruptly and climbed
several thousand feet from its last reported altitude of about 13,800 feet
to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet. ...Shortly after Flight 800
reached the peak of its accent, about 20 seconds after it exploded, a
fireball erupted from the aircraft. ..."

<p>
  [IAN: Note, as you mentioned, there is an 
  explosion at the apex in the CIA scenario, 
  but fuel sprayed out by the jet (from which
  wing, both were on? center tank only about 
  a 100 or so gallons already exploded) would 
  have fallen behind the climbing jet, and if 
  that exploded, the 60 psi pressure wave 
  (rapidly falling off) would push UP
<br>
  from below the noseless fuselage.
<br>
  If the fuel source was on board, its
<br>
  force would be distributed isotropically,
  and thus not pushing down more than up,
  but since fuel tanks are low to the 
<br>
  fuselage, could tend to push up more.]
  
<p>
  Back to CIA video:


<p>
"About 7 seconds after the left wing detached, and 49 seconds 
after the initial explosion, the burning debris hit the water." 


<p>
  IAN: 20 second up (13800 to 17000) and 
  29 seconds down to 0 (since 49 - 20 = 29).
  There you go, every number I stated is in 
  there. I think you owe me an apology for 
  claiming that I irresponsibly altered 
  wasn't! You then proceed to draw other 
  erroneous conclusions therefrom such as
  that which adorns the subject line above.

<p>
  It stands without refutation that the Govt
  said a jet at the apex of a climb (it falls
  after a climb WHEN it reaches zero velocity) 
  fell from 17,000 to 0 in 29 seconds, about 
  25% faster that physical law allows.
