From: "Michael S. Lorrey" &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;

<i>&gt;This brings up the subject of limits. As extropians, we beleive in</i><br>
<i>&gt;there being little or no limits on human beings, outside of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;limit on interfering with others harmfully. We must ask, "Does</i><br>
<a href="2316.html#2395qlink1">&gt;this sort of moral engineering fit with extropy?" I say it does,</a><br>
<i>&gt;for only one reason. We are talking about design specs of beings</i><br>
<i>&gt;not yet in existence, much as we could talk about possible genetic</i><br>
<i>&gt;codes of children we might have. We are not talking about altering</i><br>
<i>&gt;beings already in existence. Altering beings already in existence,</i><br>
<i>&gt;against their will, is obviously against extropy. Altering the</i><br>
<i>&gt;design of a being not yet in existence is not against extropy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Once a design altered individual comes into existence, its sense</i><br>
<i>&gt;of self is derived from its design. That we were able to finely</i><br>
<i>&gt;control what type of individual came into existence is no more</i><br>
<i>&gt;against extropy than in controlling what the genetic code of our</i><br>
<i>&gt;children will be.</i><br>


<p>
The problem with playing god is who gets to decide.

<p>
If it were a simple majority decision, right now for example, the
SI's would be engineered to be anti-gun. (simple example)

<p>
As an Extropian I believe the ability to evolve without limits
applys to all conscious entities, hence preprogrammed moral
engineering could exist as a starting point, but there must not be
an electromagnetic shotgun wired to these beings foreheads.
