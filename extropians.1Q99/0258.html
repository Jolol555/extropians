Being an admirer of the late Prof. Einstein, I paid this link a visit,
hoping to find a thoughtful, or at least fresh, perspective by an
incomparable intellect. Alas, I was gravely disappointed. He does little
more than repeat the standard litany of groundless assertions that had
already been discredited when he wrote the piece. The flaws are so
transparent, it's obvious to me that he never gave any real thought to the
subject.

<p>
All this article proves is that Einstein was no economist, had learned
little from political history, and was uninterested in critically examining
the assumptions he acquired from his upbringing and academic background. I
expected better from such an otherwise brilliant thinker.

<p>
As has been pointed out, whatever his stated ethical standards may have
been, he in fact favored institutionalized thuggery.
