So you see our point? When one side is spending a thousand times as much
as the other, they lose.

<p>
<a name="3497qlink6">And you know what? That's not possible for much longer, BECAUSE THE 
UNPOPULAR LITTLE GROUP CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE ATTACKING NATION! It 
only works when that little group can only kill the invading force,
once the little group has nuclear, biological or chemical weapons they
can kill the leaders and millions of civilians of the nation which chooses 
to attack them. At that point it is no longer a feasible strategy.</a>

<p>
Don't you get it yet? Mass destruction weapons change *everything*. When
one person can kill millions, traditional warfare is no longer possible;
you cannot coerce nuclear-armed individuals.</a>

<p>
This is silly. Gunpowder brought the end of feudalism because now a single
individual with a gun could kill the best mounted knight, and a small army
with a cannon could bring down the best defensive walls. Just</a> as widespread

modern authoritarian government.
