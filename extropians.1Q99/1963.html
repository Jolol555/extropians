In the Recent past...in response to various questions or remarks...various
esteemed personages have stated...

 
<p>
<a href="1958.html#1963qlink1">&gt;  Just out of curiosity, didn't this list used to believe in science?</a><br>
  
<p>
&gt; &gt;On the whole, I think the entire topic is not worth the time it takes to
argue about it.


<p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Permit me to inject a few points before departing this conversation:


<OL>
  <li>  Every basic physics book oversimplifies. That's why they call
it "basic"
                      physics.


</OL>
<p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;...mix physicistese with bureaucratese and its a wonder its readable at
all. ;)

<p>
These were from various authors on this list over the last several hours.  

<p>
As I walk into the truckstop in a minute I'm no doubt going to see copies for
sale of such luminary publications as...The Weekly World News....The
Star...and The National Enquirer.

<p>

informed populance?</a>

<p>
<a name="1982qlink1"><a name="1972qlink1">I noticed that gun makers are held liable now for acts committed</a> with their
<a name="1982qlink2">products....I notice that funding for science is down...I notice</a> that ........

</a>

<p>
well never mind....

<p>
just a thought...
