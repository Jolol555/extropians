Sort of.  Word 2000 makes real HTML files, and they usually display OK in
both Netscape and Explorer.  However, it also records all of the information
it needs to convert the HTML back into a Word document, so you end up with a
lot of extra meta tags, HTML comments, and XML tags.  I certainly wouldn't
recommend editing the result by hand!  I don't think it resorts to ActiveX
controls unless you start putting in content that can't be duplicated in
HTML - stuff like spreadsheets, macros, certain types of data entry form,
and maybe the automatic index and TOC features (which most people don't use
anyway).

<p>
If you just want text documents with relatively normal formatting, and you
don't expect to do much hand-editing of the HTML,  I don't think you'll have
a problem.  If you need more than that you'll probably want to look
elsewhere.  I've attached a typical sample of what a converted document
looks like, just in case you're curious.
