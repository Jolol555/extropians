We can

<a name="0715qlink1"><a name="0683qlink1">  IAN: If mice are in low-crowed environments but

  So hunting change is zero and yet aggression
  change is nonzero, which speaks against the 
  theory you raise that country folk are less

  IAN: OK, good point, my error. By

  "great apes" I meant the gorillas,

  I guess of all the primates, they
