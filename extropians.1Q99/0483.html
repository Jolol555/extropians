Me:

<a name="0488qlink1"><a href="0449.html#0483qlink1">&gt;You might want to check out some recent work in the field of ethology (the</a><br>
<i>&gt;science of animal behavior). All social animals tend to avoid "antisocial"</i><br>
<i>&gt;behavior, as those who don't, tend to find their lineages weeded out of</i><br>
the
<br>
<i>&gt;gene pool.</i><br>

<p>
Samael:
<br>
<a href="0470.html#0483qlink2">&gt;You know, I could have sworn that I read an article in New Scientist over</a><br>
<i>&gt;the last few months that found that infidelity was extremely high in</i><br>
<i>&gt;animals, who try as hard as possible not to get caught.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0534qlink1">Depends on what you call "infidelity". Some species are promiscuous,</a> others
<a name="0534qlink2">mate for life. In those species where promiscuity is the norm, it's
perfectly "acceptable" behavior. Promiscuity is not infidelity, since no
long-term bond of trust is expected. Individuals of species with a
tradition of "marriage" OTOH are seldom observed to violate the bond--and
those who practice infidelity often face sanctions.
