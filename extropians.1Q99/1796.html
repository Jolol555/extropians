<a name="1868qlink1">	Now we're talking.  What is everyone actually doing?</a>

<p>
	I have an old dormant bank account in a state we moved away
from several years ago.  I recently wrote a check for $1000 and put it
in there as a back up source for drawing checks in case my local
active credit union checking account has problems.

<p>
	I plan on having a few hundred bucks of cache sitting around
the house.  (Some of my family is saying you should have, and they
each do have, 3 months salary of cache laying around.  That's too much
for me.)

<p>
	I recently refinanced our house and pulled out an extra $10K
to put in the stock market when it supposedly has this crash.  I
thought the drop several months ago was the start, but now with the
market back being so strong this year, I'm sure I've long since missed
whatever crash/bargain opportunities might have occurred.

<p>
	This January 99 saw a lot of new money going into the stock
market due to the typical "January effect".  I'd bet the "January
effect" after the new millennium next year when everyone realizes the
y2k problems isn't, the market will go hog willed with everyone trying
to get their saved up cache back into the market.  I'm going to try to
have most of my cache back in the market long before then.
