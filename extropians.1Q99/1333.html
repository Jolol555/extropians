As far as making small robots walk, fly, move things around, and so on I
think you're right.  Solar power should be fine for anything that has access
to it, and you should be able to fuel thin layers of nanobots that way with
a moderate amount of specialization (solar collector bots on top, which
produce fuel molecules consumed by the bots further down).

<p>
Once you start talking about nanotech fabrication that changes things.  I
think Drexler did some calculations on this based on the energy required to
break atomic bonds, and the energy requirements turned out to be pretty
high.  Tearing random matter apart into its constituent atoms is not a very
efficient way to make things - which is one reason why nanotech factory
systems are likely to build things faster than free-roaming replicators.

<p>
Solar-powered nanobots should still be feasible, but they would probably
operate on the same time scale as plants (better efficiency and higher
energy requirements should come within an order of magnitude of balancing
out).  That's fast enough to be quite useful, but not fast enough for some
of the applications that have been considered - especially for military use,
or for really large-scale construction.
