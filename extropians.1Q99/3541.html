Getting funding for this project is obviously going to be pretty tough.
However, I think there are some smaller, short-term projects that could be
used to raise money for it while developing relevant experience.

<p>
For example, the field of code generators is very underdeveloped right now.
Either of us could easily create software components capable of writing
useful code, and we wouldn't have to advance the state of the art to start
making money.  Looking a couple of years down the line, work on less
specialized code writing systems looks like a good way to explore the issues
that would be involved in creating a real coding domdule.

<p>
I'm interested.  Later this year I should be able to offer the use of a
dedicated server with modern database software, which could be useful for
managing projects (I'm just waiting for DSL to become available in my area).
