Please, don't mistake my intentions - maybe I should have been more blunt.
I believe that religion was a major stepping stone for humanity in
understanding nature - thousands of years ago.  It has become twisted over
time into a wrote memorization of rules for living that were useful in the
infancy of civilization. But it is a persistent ideology, one that refuses
to release its many tentacled grip on most of humanity.
<p>
    I claim no theology.  I accept the world as it presents itself, which I
suppose could be considered an ideology in itself.  For now the most logical
explanation for our existence would seem to be that we (life) were created
and shaped from the natural laws of the cosmos.  If at some later time it
can be objectively proven that we were created by some power mad super being
with a need for playthings, so be it, but the evidence is heavily stacked
against it.
<p>
    People are never "stuck" with an idea system.  It takes strength of will
to analyze your own belief system and find it lacking, but there is nothing
stopping a person from doing so.  The post caught my attention mainly
because of its "wayward soul" conotation.  I would hope those subscribing to
this list would have the utmost sense of direction.  I am not a searcher,
not a seeker, but a doer.

<p>
P.S.  I can't believe I've been sucked into a religious philosophy
discussion.  Somebody remind to take my frustrations out elsewhere and just
ignore it the next time this topic raises its ugly head here.
