Good luck.  I knew him several years ago, when we Houston cryonicists were
having regular meetings.  He would usually show up, but that was just
because he enjoys talking to people who don't plan on dying.  As near as I
can make out, his theory is that cryonics is such a long shot that he is
better off putting all his resources into promoting medical research.  He
isn't really all that rich, and at his age he'd probably have to pay cash
for his suspension arrangements.

<p>
Now, maybe when that Y2K deadline of his passes he'll be willing to
reconsider.
