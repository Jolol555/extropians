<a href="0527.html#0543qlink1">&lt;&lt; A Colorado partnership consisting of three people claims to have</a><br>
 developed a technology to turn the Internet into one massive
 supercomputer.  I'm a bit skeptical of this claim but the PR
 Newswire deemed it fit enough to publish.  It will be interesting
 to see the technical specs of this concept.  If tenable, it will
 be more interesting to see what, if any, emergent properties
 develop due to the implementation of such technology.

There already is something like that, caled Distributed.net, I believe there
are 800,000 computers signed on, and its basically a small program that
continuously runs using the cpu you're not using, so its always out of the
way, and while you're online it trades informtation packets.  I believe the
purposes consist of cracking codes and things, I'm really not sure what all it
does, but I have it.  Also in April SETI is coming out with a screen saver
that will process their information, the saver has a 3d view of the sound, and
the area of sky it is seeing(hearing), and also the actual sound thats being
processed.  Sounds really cool.
