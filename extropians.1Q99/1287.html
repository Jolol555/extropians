So far as energy production is concerned that is correct.  The containment
system will tend to consume a larger portion of the bomb's mass as it gets
smaller, but that's just an engineering problem - I wouldn't be surprised if
someone found a way around it.

<p>
Antimatter devices are possible at any scale you want to use.  However,
really small ones (less than about 0.1 kT) won't make an explosion.  That's
because matter-antimatter reactions release their energy as high-energy
gamma radiation, which can penetrate large amounts of normal matter before
being absorbed.  Thus, the energy of the bomb will always be spread over a
certain minimum volume of space - you can't make an antimatter bomb that
creates small explosions.  If the bomb doesn't put out enough energy to
power a big explosion, you end up irradiating the area and heating it up a
bit instead.

<p>
So, antimatter devices would be a major threat.  The delivery vehicle can't
actually be nanoscale, but it could probably be as small as a dust mote and
still carry an effective weapon.
