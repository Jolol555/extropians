<p>
And how are they going to do that? You're implicitly assuming a disarmed
population who are happy to let the PPAs do whatever they want. That ain't
gonna happen.

The whole point of anarcho-capitalism is that it by its very nature it
has these negative-feedback mechanisms. You can't assume them away and
expect to get any kind of reasonable view of what an anarcho-capitalist
society would be like. In effect it's merely taking your glorious minimal
state idea and expanding the competition between power structures to
include everyone in the society, not just everyone in the government.
