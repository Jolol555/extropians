<a name="3124qlink1"><a name="3116qlink1">I was thinking about the RainForest/Extropian connection this morning
and the comment someone made that science will eventually replace all
of the extinct animals we've killed...</a></a>

<p>
In this month's Discover magazine there's an article about Japanese
scientists that want to clone a Wooly Mammoth.

<p>
<a name="3214qlink1">Humans with our technology have done great damage to our planet (or at
least parts of it).  The left-greenies (Al Gore comes to mind) suggest
that we should rethink our reliance on technology as a possible
solution.  Us Extropians know that that's hogwash.</a>

<p>
Technology got us into this mess (pollution, extinctions, etc.), and
it's the only thing that can get us out.

<p>
<a name="3116qlink2">Your average Joe on the street probably wouldn't even pause to
consider that immortality is inevitable, but he may get excited to
know that technology will eventually help us rebuild our planet.

<p>
If we, as Extropians, are to become activists, maybe this could be a
large part of our message.  I think people will "buy" into the idea of
technology as a curative force for the planet quicker than they will
"buy" one primarily promoting immortality, space colonization, and
artificial intelligence.  (Not to say that we should back off those
subjects...)</a>
