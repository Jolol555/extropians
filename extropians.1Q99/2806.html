<i>|example to all. </i><br>

<p>
Or the nightmare: the Big Brother Power requiring permanent worship,
while totally controlling the social and personal lifes of lower beings.

<p>
The Power could do this on the moral grounds that it must help the lower
beings to ascend, against their puny wills if necessary.

<p>
A lower Power could be seen as a saint or buddha.  A higher Power could make
a saint or buddha to control and communicate the lower beings if needed.
 
<p>
<a href="2357.html#2806qlink2">|2)  Unsolicited Worship - I definitely see the point of feeling little</a><br>

<i>|worshippers lot, they begin to pay attention to more difficult problems, ones</i><br>
<i>|they may have been at first unaware of or have accepted as unalterable, such</i><br>
<i>|as death.  A Power could inadvertantly trigger the Uplifting of an entire</i><br>
<i>|people.  You could say that this act is more than enough, and that the</i><br>
<i>|worshippers should be greatful for that much and do the rest on their own.</i><br>

<p>
Why would a Power care if puny beings feel grateful or not?

<p>
<a href="2357.html#2806qlink3">|This may be fine, but what if what your aid has in some way led them down an</a><br>
<i>|evolutionary deadend, and the only way they can see out is with help.  Do you</i><br>

<i>|problem without worshipping you?  Or do you continue to help them, guiding</i><br>
<i>|them to a point where they no longer need you?  There are two basic approaches</i><br>

<i>|(dare I make a comparison to the Star Trek Prime Directive....argh!), the</i><br>
<i>|other to take up the mantle of Godhood until you can help your worshippers to</i><br>
<i>|maturity and kick them out of the nest (kind of like a good parent).</i><br>

<p>
A Power built on standard human values would definitely meddle in the affairs
of the lower beings (consider how humans treat their pet animals).

<p>
The Prime Directive idea appears a rather unusual human world view.

<p>
A more non-human (inhuman? ;) Power could simply leave the lower beings to
live their puny lives and die their puny deaths, but have a surveillance
of the goings-on in case something interesting happens.  Objects of study.
If they become a pest, terminate them.
