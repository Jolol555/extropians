<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;From The Independent Review, March 19th, 1999:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           The memory of molecules</i><br>
<i>&gt;           =======================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Can molecules communicate with each other,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           exchanging information without being in physical</i><br>
<i>&gt;           contact? French biologist Jacques Benveniste believes</i><br>
<i>&gt;           so, but his scientific peers are still sceptical. By Lionel</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Milgrom</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Jacques Benveniste was once considered to be one of</i><br>
<i>&gt;           France's most respected biologists, until he was cast</i><br>
<i>&gt;           adrift from the scientific mainstream. His downfall</i><br>
<i>&gt;           began in 1988 when he infuriated the scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;           community with experimental results which he took</i><br>
<i>&gt;           as evidence to suggest that water has a memory. His</i><br>
<i>&gt;           ideas were seized upon by homeopaths keen to find</i><br>
<i>&gt;           support for their theories on highly diluted</i><br>
<i>&gt;           medicines, but were condemned by scientific purists.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Now, Benveniste believes he has evidence to suggest</i><br>
<i>&gt;           that it may one day be possible to transmit the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           curative power of life-saving drugs around the world</i><br>
<i>&gt;           - via the Internet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           It sounds like science fiction and Benveniste will</i><br>
<i>&gt;           have a hard time convincing a deeply sceptical world</i><br>
<i>&gt;           that he is right. Nevertheless, he began his campaign</i><br>
<i>&gt;           last week when he announced the latest research to</i><br>
<i>&gt;           come out of his Digital Biology Laboratory near Paris,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           to a packed audience of scientists at the Pippard</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Lecture Theatre at Cambridge University's Cavendish</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Physics Laboratory. Benveniste suggested that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           specific effects of biologically active molecules such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;           adrenalin, nicotine and caffeine, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           immunological signatures of viruses and bacteria, can</i><br>
<i>&gt;           be recorded and digitised using a computer</i><br>
<i>&gt;           sound-card. A keystroke later, and these signals can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;           winging their way across the globe, courtesy of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Internet. Biological systems far away from their</i><br>
<i>&gt;           activating molecules can then - he suggested - be</i><br>
<i>&gt;           triggered simply by playing back the recordings.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Most scientists have dismissed Benveniste as being</i><br>
<i>&gt;           on the fringe, although there were some famous</i><br>
<i>&gt;           names in the audience last week, including Sir</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Andrew Huxley, Nobel laureate and past president of</i><br>
<i>&gt;           the Royal Society, and the physicist Professor Brian</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Josephson, also a Nobel laureate. Benveniste started</i><br>
<i>&gt;           by asking some apparently childish questions. If</i><br>
<i>&gt;           molecules could talk, what would they sound like?</i><br>
<i>&gt;           More specifically, can we eavesdrop on their</i><br>
<i>&gt;           conversations, record them, and play them back? The</i><br>
<i>&gt;           answer to these last three questions is, according to</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Benveniste, a resounding "Oui!" He further suggested</i><br>
<i>&gt;           that these "recordings" can make molecules respond</i><br>
<i>&gt;           in the same way as they do when they react.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Contradicting the way biologists think biochemical</i><br>
<i>&gt;           reactions occur, he claims molecules do not have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;           be in close proximity to affect each other. "It's like</i><br>
<i>&gt;           listening to Pavarotti or Elton John," Benveniste</i><br>
<i>&gt;           explained. "We hear the sound and experience</i><br>
<i>&gt;           emotions, whether they're live or on CD."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           For example, anger produces adrenalin. When</i><br>
<i>&gt;           adrenalin molecules bind to their receptor sites, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;           set off a string of biological events that, among other</i><br>
<i>&gt;           things, make blood vessels contract. Biologists say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;           adrenalin is acting as a molecular signalling device</i><br>
<i>&gt;           but, Benveniste asks, what is the real nature of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           signal? And how come the adrenalin molecules</i><br>
<i>&gt;           specifically target their receptors and no others, at</i><br>
<i>&gt;           incredible speed? According to Benveniste, if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           cause of such biochemical events were simply due to</i><br>
<i>&gt;           random collisions between adrenalin molecules and</i><br>
<i>&gt;           their receptors (the currently accepted theory of</i><br>
<i>&gt;           molecular signalling), then it should take longer than</i><br>
<i>&gt;           it does to get angry.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Benveniste became the bete noire of the French</i><br>
<i>&gt;           scientific establishment back in 1988, when a paper he</i><br>
<i>&gt;           had published in the science journal Nature was later</i><br>
<i>&gt;           rubbished by the then editor, Sir John Maddox, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt;           team that included a professional magician, James</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Randi. With an international group of scientists from</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Canada, France, Israel and Italy, Benveniste had</i><br>
<i>&gt;           claimed that vigorously shaking water solutions of an</i><br>
<i>&gt;           antibody could evoke a biological response, even</i><br>
<i>&gt;           when that antibody was diluted out of existence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Non-agitated solutions produced little or no effect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Nature said that the results of the experiment that</i><br>
<i>&gt;           produced the "ghostly antibodies" were, frankly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           unbelievable. The journal itself came in for criticism</i><br>
<i>&gt;           for publishing the paper in the first place.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           In his Nature paper, Benveniste reasoned that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           effect of dilution and agitation pointed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;           transmission of biological information via some</i><br>
<i>&gt;           molecular organisation going on in water. This</i><br>
<i>&gt;           "memory of water" effect, as it was later known,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           proved Benveniste's academic undoing. For while</i><br>
<i>&gt;           the referees of his Nature paper could not fault</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Benveniste's experimental procedures, they could not</i><br>
<i>&gt;           understand his results. How, they asked, can a</i><br>
<i>&gt;           biological system respond to an antigen when no</i><br>
<i>&gt;           molecules of it can be detected in solution? It goes</i><br>
<i>&gt;           against the accepted "lock-and-key" principle, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;           states that molecules must be in contact and</i><br>
<i>&gt;           structurally match before information can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;           exchanged. Such thinking has dominated the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           biological sciences for more than four decades, and is</i><br>
<i>&gt;           itself rooted in the views of the 17th-century French</i><br>
<i>&gt;           philosopher Rene Descartes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Nature's attempted debunking exercise failed to find</i><br>
<i>&gt;           evidence of fraud, but concluded that Benveniste's</i><br>
<i>&gt;           research was essentially unreproducible, a claim he</i><br>
<i>&gt;           has always denied. From being a respected figure in</i><br>
<i>&gt;           the French biological establishment, Benveniste was</i><br>
<i>&gt;           pilloried, losing his government funding and his</i><br>
<i>&gt;           laboratory. Undeterred, he and his now-depleted</i><br>
<i>&gt;           research team somehow continued to investigate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           biological effects of agitated, highly dilute solutions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           The latest results are, for biologists, even more</i><br>
<i>&gt;           incredible than those in the 1988 Nature paper.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Physicists, however, should have less of a problem as</i><br>
<i>&gt;           their discipline is based on fields (eg gravitational,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           electromagnetic) which have well-established</i><br>
<i>&gt;           long-range effects. If Benveniste's claims prove to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;           true - which is far from certain - they could have</i><br>
<i>&gt;           profound consequences, not least for medical</i><br>
<i>&gt;           diagnostics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Benveniste's explanation starts innocuously enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;           with a musical analogy. Two vibrating strings close</i><br>
<i>&gt;           together in frequency will produce a "beat". The</i><br>
<i>&gt;           length of this beat increases as the two frequencies</i><br>
<i>&gt;           approach each other. Eventually, when they are the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           same, the beat disappears. This is the way musicians</i><br>
<i>&gt;           tune their instruments, and Benveniste uses the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           analogy to explain his water-memory theory. Thus,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           all molecules are made from atoms which are</i><br>
<i>&gt;           constantly vibrating and emitting infrared radiation</i><br>
<i>&gt;           in a highly complex manner. These infrared</i><br>
<i>&gt;           vibrations have been detected for years by scientists,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           and are a vital part of their armoury of methods for</i><br>
<i>&gt;           identifying molecules.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           However, precisely because of the complexity of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;           infrared vibrations, molecules also produce much</i><br>
<i>&gt;           lower "beat" frequencies. It turns out that these beats</i><br>
<i>&gt;           are within the human audible range (20 to 20,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Hertz) and are specific for every different molecule.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Thus, as well as radiating in the infrared region,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           molecules also broadcast frequencies in the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;           range as the human voice. This is the molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt;           signal that Benveniste detects and records.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           If molecules can broadcast, then they should also be</i><br>
<i>&gt;           able to receive. The specific broadcast of one</i><br>
<i>&gt;           molecular species will be picked up by another,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           "tuned" by its molecular structure to receive it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Benveniste calls this matching of broadcast with</i><br>
<i>&gt;           reception "co-resonance", and says it works like a</i><br>
<i>&gt;           radio set. Thus, when you tune your radio to, say,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Classic FM, both your set and the transmitting station</i><br>
<i>&gt;           are vibrating at the same frequency. Twitch the dial a</i><br>
<i>&gt;           little, and you're listening to Radio 1: different</i><br>
<i>&gt;           tuning, different sounds.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           This, Benveniste claims, is how millions of biological</i><br>
<i>&gt;           molecules manage to communicate at the speed of</i><br>
<i>&gt;           light with their own corresponding molecule and no</i><br>
<i>&gt;           other. It also explains why minute changes in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           structure of a molecule can profoundly alter its</i><br>
<i>&gt;           biological effect. It is not that these tiny structural</i><br>
<i>&gt;           changes make it a bad fit with its biological receptor</i><br>
<i>&gt;           (the classical lock-and-key approach). The structural</i><br>
<i>&gt;           modifications "detune" the molecule to its receptor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           What is more, and just like radio sets and receivers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           the molecules do not have to be close together for</i><br>
<i>&gt;           communication to take place.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           So what is the function of water in all this?</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Benveniste explains this by pointing out that all</i><br>
<i>&gt;           biological reactions occur in water. The water</i><br>
<i>&gt;           molecules completely surround every other molecule</i><br>
<i>&gt;           placed among them. A single protein molecule, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;           example, will have a fan club of at least 10,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;           admiring water molecules. And they are not just</i><br>
<i>&gt;           hangers-on. Benveniste believes they are the agents</i><br>
<i>&gt;           that in fact relay and amplify the biological signal</i><br>
<i>&gt;           coming from the original molecule.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           It is like a CD which, by itself, cannot produce a sound</i><br>
<i>&gt;           but has the means to create it etched into its surface.</i><br>
<i>&gt;           In order for the sound to be heard, it needs to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;           played back through an electronic amplifier. And just</i><br>
<i>&gt;           as Pavarotti or Elton John is on the CD only as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;           "memory", so water can memorise and amplify the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           signals of molecules that have been dissolved and</i><br>
<i>&gt;           diluted out of existence. The molecules do not have</i><br>
<i>&gt;           to be there, only their "imprint" on the solution in</i><br>
<i>&gt;           which they are dissolved. Agitation makes the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           memory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           So what do molecules sound like? "At the moment</i><br>
<i>&gt;           we don't quite know," says Didier Guillonnet,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Benveniste's colleague at the Digital Research</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Laboratory. "When we record a molecule such as</i><br>
<i>&gt;           caffeine, for example, we should get a spectrum, but it</i><br>
<i>&gt;           seems more like noise. However, when we play the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           caffeine recording back to a biological system sensitive</i><br>
<i>&gt;           to it, the system reacts. We are only recording and</i><br>
<i>&gt;           replaying; at the moment we cannot recognise a</i><br>
<i>&gt;           pattern." "But," Benveniste adds, "the biological</i><br>
<i>&gt;           systems do. We've sent the caffeine signal across the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Atlantic by standard telecommunications and it's still</i><br>
<i>&gt;           produced an effect."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           The effect is measured on a "biological system" such</i><br>
<i>&gt;           as a piece of living tissue. Benveniste claims, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;           instance, that the signal from molecules of heparin - a</i><br>
<i>&gt;           component of the blood-clotting system - slows down</i><br>
<i>&gt;           coagulation of blood when transmitted over the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Internet from a laboratory in Europe to another in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           US. If true, it will undoubtedly earn Benveniste a</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Nobel prize. If not, he will receive only more scorn.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Benveniste's ideas are revolutionary - many might</i><br>
<i>&gt;           say heretical or misguided - and he is unlikely to</i><br>
<i>&gt;           persuade his most ardent critics. Although his ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt;           may seem plausible enough, he will win over his</i><br>
<i>&gt;           enemies only if his results can be replicated by other</i><br>
<i>&gt;           laboratories. So far this has not been done to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           satisfaction of his many detractors. </i><br>
