(WAS:  SPACE/NET: Getting The Internet Off The Ground And Into Orbit)

<p>
Between that and the Space Hilton, this is one of the most heartwarming
things I've heard in years.  They want to start limited commercial
flights in 2000!

<p>
As a Singularitarian, I'm not excited because of the economic benefits
of asteroid mining or even lunar mining; I don't see that in a near-term
time frame.  The payload and cost-to-orbit looks like it might be
economical for Solar Power Satellites, which could prove economically
important.  The main reason, of course, is the possibility of
self-sustaining O'Neill or lunar colonies.  Just in case I'm right and
work too slow but Drexler's wrong and works too fast, you understand.

<p>
So my question is this:  O'Neill colonies, capable of sustaining
themselves with no help from Earth for at least a year, no sooner than
2002 and no later than 2013.  Can It Be Done?  How Much Will It Cost?

<p>
I'm assuming that we send up an independent nanotechnology lab.  This
way, even if someone cooks the Earth, they can duplicate the nanotech
independently and go on to _Aristoi_ from there.  This assumes that the
first assembler either isn't a Deep Dark Secret or that the military
labs have a continuous channel to space that they can use, in case of
defeat, to altruistically transmit the Secret before being eaten.  How
Much Will It Cost?

<p>
This would really cover all the bases on (survival of
humanity)/(Singularity); nuclear war leaves Australia (although the
colonies are dead), nanowar leaves nanotech-enabled colonies.
