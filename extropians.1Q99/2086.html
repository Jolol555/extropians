<p>
I've been in the lurking mode because I have been very busy with my 
PhD and other things recently, but now it's finally time to present 
'The Transhumanist FAQ'.

<p>
<a name="2150qlink1">The project became much bigger than originally intended. The present 
version is more than 15,000 words. I have tried to give substantial 
answers that get to the core of the matter, while at the same time 
being as concise as possible.</a>

<p>
Many of the questions are really objections. Some of the objections 
rest on misunderstandings, and they should meet with a vigorous 
response. But others point out genuine problems, and there I think 
the right approach is not to try to smooth over the difficulties or 
wriggle out of the attack through clever rhetoric. Rather, 
transhumanism will grow to the extent it is able to acknowledge these 
problems and take them into account. If our opponents have a good 
point, let's incorporate that into out thinking and be grateful that 
they pointed it out to us -- then we will have one vulnerable spot 
less in future encounters.

<p>
The FAQ would not have been possible without the input from many 
people. At least 50 persons have contributed and I'm grateful to all 
of you. Two persons must be especially mentioned: Kathryn Aegis, who 
provided painstaking editorial help as well as valuable advise and 
contributions to the content, and Anders Sandberg, who gave detailed 
feedback, wrote some of the answers, and provided ideas for many of 
them.

<p>
The FAQ will be continuously updated and modified. Especially the 
initial round of feedback now might well necessitate substantial 
revisions.

<p>
I suggest that we use critlink for comments on particular points of 
substance and style, whereas more general comments can be made to the 
lists.

<p>
The home of the FAQ is:

<p>
<a href="http://www.transhumanist.org">http://www.transhumanist.org</a>

<p>
If you want to look at it with critlink, you go to:
<a href="http://www.crit.org/http://www.transhumanist.org">http://www.crit.org/http://www.transhumanist.org</a>

<p>
Now I will just have to sit back and await your judgement.
