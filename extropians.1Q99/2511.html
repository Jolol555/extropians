An isolation tank is a large self-contained box about 8 x 4 ft.  Inside is about 10-12
inches of water kept at a steady 93.5 degrees F. and about 800 lbs. of Epsom salt - so
you float weightless.  One you are inside the tank, you are completely isolated from
all environmental light and sound.  Imagine feeling totally weightless and relaxed
beyond anything you've preciously experienced along with incredible peace of mind
because there is nothing to distract you.  I highly recommend you try it!  :-)

Spike, don't you live near Palo Alto?  If you do, I think there is still a Spa
operating there called Watercourse Way.  Last I was there, about 10 years ago, they
had 3 tanks.
