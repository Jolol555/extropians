<a name="2118qlink1"><a href="2092.html#2115qlink1">&gt;There are two areas that need rethinking [in the FAQ]</a><br>

<p>
<a href="2092.html#2115qlink2">&gt;First, one area where I did stumble was re extropianism and politics: As an</a><br>
<i>&gt;extropian (and on the Advisory Council) I am *NOT* a libertarian.  I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone who votes on issues and not party aligned.  </i><br>

<p>
Firstly, I would note that libertarianism is not a political party, it is 
</a>a philosophy. 

<p>
<a name="2127qlink1"><a name="2118qlink2">Also, I would be willing to argue that it would be very hard to be 
extropian and not believe in maximal liberty for individuals and minimal 
government, probably as defined by Rand as zero government outside 
defending the (libertarian) constitution.</a></a> 

<p>
<a name="2118qlink3">Still, I agree that  one does not need to belong to the Libertarian Party 
to be extropian nor does the minimal definition of extropian views on 
political life, as above, correspond to hard-core libertarianism.

<p>
<a name="2127qlink2">I wonder what the resolution is? Transhumanism must have a political 
philosophy of some kind if it is a minimally complete view of human 
</a></a>future. 

<p>
<a name="2127qlink3"><a name="2116qlink1">I propose this passage:

<p>
"Transhumans do not view any larger organisation which they may join from 
time to time as being in any way transcendent of their individual selves. 
Their politics are constrained by this principle.</a>

<p>
<a name="2127qlink4">In particular, Transhumanism excludes all communitarian forms of 
government based on notions that any other individual, "society", or any 
other entity has any call upon them which transcends the transhumanist's 
individual choices.</a></a> 

<p>
Several rights which all transhumanists accept extend from this notion of 
self as personal property and are an essential element of Transhumanism.

<p>
An exemplar right which may be derived from these transhuman principles 
is that suicide is a human right."

<p>
<a name="2127qlink5"><a name="2118qlink4"><i>&gt;Secondly, ... the credit goes to</i><br>
<a href="2092.html#2115qlink3">&gt;Max More for having created the world view of transhumanism</a><br>

<p>
Yes. Let's just say "Max More defined Transhumanism."
