<a name="1569qlink1">First off laws which allow for the prosecution of businesses which
advertise via spam has absolutely *nothing* to do with encryption or
anonymity with the exception that the use of falsified headers IN SPAM is
treated as the fraud</a> it is.  If you do not plan on marketing your wares on
the net via spamvertizing you have nothing to fear from this.

<p>
Are you familiar with the law against junk faxes?  When it was first
proposed there were people crying out "it is the end of civilization and
free speach (tm) etc. etc."<a name="1569qlink2">  Well the law has been in place for a number
of years, and has upheld on appeals, and you are still able to practice
your freedom of speech (except by sending unsolicited faxes to people) and
you still have</a> anonymity and the country has not turned into a police
state which makes you implant a tracking chip in your arm.

<p>
<a name="1566qlink1">Legislation is one part of the solution to ending unsolicited
commercial/bulk email.</a>  Actions by honest ISP's who remove spammers from
their network after fining them $200-$1000 on their credit cards is
another part of it.  Making it unprofitable and to risky to spam and use
of the RBL, ORCA, ORBS, DSSL are another tool as is filtering during the
SMTP session.  

<p>
<a name="1569qlink3">This is simply anti-theft and anti-netabuse legislation.  If you are not
stealing from people and hijacking other peoples mail servers and network
feeds you have nothing to fear.</a>  Talk to the owners of the ISP's who have
<a name="1569qlink4">had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars just to protect their
networks from the criminals and ask them what they think of spamming and
about laws to curb</a> it.  You can start with nick@pbi.net - they had to
spend $500,000 to protect PacBellInternet from the spammers.

<p>
As for the ad hominem attack I won't reply with the same.  I prefer
<a name="1579qlink21"><a name="1569qlink5">arguments of logic rather than insulting the people I'm carrying</a> on a
dialogue with - its much more effective.</a>

How strange. I read Usenet almost every day, so I can't quite understand
how the spammers have killed it; in fact I rarely see any spam ad in there
these days. One reason for that is that rather than arguing for pointless
laws, people went out and started cancelling the spams. Technical solutions
to technical problems.

<p>
Indeed. That's why us good men are so concerned about you evil anti-spam
freaks who don't seem to have a clue as to the effects of your proposed
laws on non-spammers. You want to sacrifice our freedom and privacy for
your supposed safety. We don't want that.

<p>
You cannot stop spam with laws unless those laws are globally enforced
and all traces of Internet privacy is eliminated. That means no
anonymity, no encryption, and ID checks before anyone is allowed on the
Net. That is evil, and you and Mike and the other anti-spam freaks are
the worst threat to freedom on the Net today.

<p>
I can only assume that aliens have kidnapped Mike and replaced him with
a government-loving fascist clone, because he's usually far more sensible
than he has been recently.
