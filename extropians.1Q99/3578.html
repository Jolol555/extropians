<p>
True, but while the Patriot may be on a mobile platform, it is not capable of being
fired with the platform on the move, so it is relatively useless for an attacking
army to use. It is specifically a weapon for rapid deployment to defend fixed
installatioins.

I may have spoke too soon. It seems to have been upgraded since when I was in the
militiary. The quoted material below is an announcement by Raytheon for a contract
they won to supply target simulation missiles for use in testing Sidewinder,
Sparrow, and Aegis missile systems:

<i>&gt; Raytheon Aircraft Wins $8.6 Million Target Contract</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     WICHITA, Kan. -- Raytheon Aircraft has been awarded an $8.6 million contract to supply the U.S. Naval Air</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Systems Command with 55 AQM-37C target missiles, along with payload kits and related data.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     The award is a modification to an existing contract for the additional 55 targets, bringing the total value of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     contract to $45.5 million for Raytheon Aircraft.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     The AQM-37C supersonic target is an air-launched vehicle used by the Navy and NATO nations The target</i><br>
<i>&gt;     missile was initially developed in 1962 and has been continually updated for improved performance. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;     current version flies at altitudes ranging from 1,000 feet above the surface to 100,000 feet, at speeds up to</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Mach 4.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     In addition, the AQM-37C has been upgraded for use as a ballistic target simulator. The target has flown at</i><br>
<i>&gt;     altitudes up to 235,000 feet with a range of 105 miles. Launches at Mach 1.5 at an altitude of 50,000 feet have</i><br>
<i>&gt;     extended the target's performance envelope to altitudes of 300,000 feet and a range of 165 miles, with terminal</i><br>
<i>&gt;     velocities approaching Mach 5.0.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     The target missile includes a digital autopilot, a telemetry system for flight evaluation, and a command/control</i><br>
<i>&gt;     system allowing lateral maneuvers for course correction as well as dives and pull-ups to simulate missile</i><br>
<i>&gt;     threats. The target provides weapons training for Department of Defense personnel using missiles such as the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     AIM- 7 Sparrow, AIM-9 Sidewinder and all Standard missile versions for the Aegis missile defense system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Raytheon Aircraft recently completed a contract with the U.S. Navy to design and develop the AQM-37D. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;     new version includes upgrades to the electrical and avionics systems, making the target more reliable to meet</i><br>
<i>&gt;     fleet operational requirements into the next century. Flight certification was completed in late 1997.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Raytheon Aircraft, based in Wichita, is a subsidiary of Raytheon Company. Raytheon Aircraft designs,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     manufactures, markets and supports jet, turboprop and piston-powered aircraft for the world's commercial,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     military and regional airline markets.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
That the target missile has the above performance implies that at least some of the
systems that are to be tested on it are capable of intercepting targets in that
performance range. I couln't find anything on AltaVista specifically on the
performance of the Aegis missile itself.
