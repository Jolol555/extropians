Hal,

<p>
   If I am following your post correctly, you would suggest a compromise,
where work requiring some level of consciousness would be accomplished by a
subset of a posthuman's mind, which could be distributed over several
different physical localities and focused on many different tasks
simultaneously.  This way we would have the advantage of special purpose
consciousness dedicated to tasks but with a greater life beyond the workaday
world through its intimate connection as a part of the general purpose
posthuman mind.  This is an idea that I have thought of myself as being one
way around the ethical dilemma of special purpose sentients.  Thank you for
raising the concept in relation to the question I proposed.  Borganism labor
instead of slave labor?
