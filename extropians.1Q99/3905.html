<a name="3906qlink1">The best definition of a redneck I have ever heard is someone who</a> is belligerently ignorant.  While Michael Lorrey is far from ignorant, he continues to revel in the redneckian belligerence which is only to be expected from someone who knowingly and gleefully includes the slogan from Tim McVeigh's post-OkCity truckbombing T-shirt in his sig, and "justifies" this mass homicide-approving stance by referring to a Waco video which is rivalled only by the antiabortion "Silent Scream" in its abject lack of objectivity, while daring anyone who might demonstrate the temerity to disagree with his skewed politics to "take him on" in a travestric mimicry of Suthrn Honor.   He is one individual who should be forbidden from buying fertilizer and kerosene, especially as he spouts so much of the former while pouring the latter on every fire he can find.
