In terms of solutions, there really isn't anything we can do on a group
basis. Some people here are obviously in the front-line of fixing their
companies, but most of us are only able to evaluate our personal 
circumstances and plan accordingly for the level of disruption we expect.

<a name="1797qlink1">Getting back to what I was saying about bank runs, I was amused to read
another 'Y2K is no big deal' article today. After telling people that the
biggest problem was panic, they then went on to say that everyone should
take out two weeks' pay before Christmas just in case... a recommendation 
which would by itself cause the collapse or near-collapse of the banking 
system if everyone followed it. Idiots.
