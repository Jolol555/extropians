<a href="2011.html#2016qlink1">&gt; I must admit that in *Centuries*, Attanasio does not do the best job of</a><br>
<i>&gt; capturing the superior intelligence of his metasapients, but then most authors</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually have problems in representing more-than-human intelligence. Walter Jon</i><br>
<i>&gt; Williams did a good job of it in *Aristoi*, as did Charles Sheffield in</i><br>
<i>&gt; *Proteus*, but I know of few writers who succeeded. Any names?</i><br>

<p>
I think Vinge did a nice job in A Fire Upon the Deep, but mostly
because he managed to keep the superintelligences off-stage and
cleverly suggested through various contrasts the difference between
human and superhuman intelligence. The prologue however describes a
Power directly.

<p>
Zindell has several superhumans in his books, although they tend to be
so quirky that it is hard to see the superintelligence behind their
games. 

<p>
David Brin had some interesting descriptions of post-singularity
humans in his short story "Stones of significance" (not sure if it is
published). 

<p>
John Barnes has perhaps the so far most vivid descriptions of
transhumanization in _Mother of Storms_ (I found myself jumping over
lots of sex, violence and bad weather to read more about the posthuman
subplot). 

<p>
<a href="2011.html#2016qlink2">&gt; Though I see nothing wrong in plots that pit heroes against villains, I don't</a><br>
<i>&gt; think *Centuries* is reducible to this pattern. Attanasio does a very good job</i><br>
<i>&gt; of presenting the motivations of the imploders, and though they may be</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered as callous on a cosmic scale, I think Attanasio really manages to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make them ambiguous, given that death is not final, that there is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; multiplicity of universes, and that they are after eternal bliss itself, </i><br>

<p>
This is the neat thing about the story: the philosophical situation is
non-trivial. You can really see the point of the imploders and
anti-imploders, and even the Kaliesque mother is in some sense right
(although hopelessly deluded). What I disliked was that Attanasio
fairly quickly took sides, and then allowed the hero to "save the day"
in a manner any superintelligence would have figured out in
nanoseconds (I certainly did, long before the plot got there). If I
had written it, I think I would have played up the dilemma further
instead.

<p>
<a href="2011.html#2016qlink3">&gt; BTW, when I characterized "Inherit the Stars" as one of the worst novels on</a><br>
<i>&gt; the Extropian reading list, I meant "Voyage to Yesteryear", which I found</i><br>
<i>&gt; unreadable and totally devoid of dramatic interest. "Inherit the Stars", on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the other hand, though not great literature, is a very pleasant mystery novel</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the scale of a planetary system.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, I liked it. It is pleasant in the same way as the movie _The
Andromeda Strain_ (based on Crichton's book): the plot and acting are
forgettable, but it really manages to show the scientific method in
action, a kind of xenomedical detective story (this movie likely
contributed to me becoming a scientist; when I saw it again recently I
was amazed to notice how many scenes and concepts had influenced me
deeply when I originally saw it as a small boy).
