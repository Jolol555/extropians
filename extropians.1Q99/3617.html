<a name="3634qlink2">The last time I looked, our best theory of the human brain had it being a
huge mass of interconnected neural nets, with (possibly) some more
procedural software running in an emulation layer.  That being the case, a
lone uploaded human isn't likely to be capable of making any vast
improvements to it.  By the time he finishes his first primitive neurohack
he's going to have lots of uploaded company.</a></a>

<a name="3634qlink3">I think a seed AI closely modeled on the human brain would face similar
problems.  What gives Ellison-type architectures the potential for growth is
the presence of a coding domdule, coupled with the fact that the software
has a rational architecture that can be understood with a reasonable amount
of thought.  Any system that doesn't have the same kind of internal
simplicity is going to have a much flatter enhancement curve (albeit still
exponential).</a>
