I know what you mean, but this also seems to imply
that Hayek, and Austrian economic theories more
generally, are now mere historical trivia.  Perhaps
this is because, as Robin has indicated in the past,
Hayek's Problem of Knowledge, rather than being a
fundamental constraint or pervasive element of
systems at all levels, is slowly being overcome by
"better tools", ie, models. 

<p>
(Perhaps this makes current 'Austrian' economists
'zombies'  in the sense that they lack the
'consciousness' of enlightened data-gathering and
modeling methods -- you're likely to meet more than a
few of these 'ghosts' at GMU -- anyway,
<br>
congratulations on the new position and welcome to
the (l)east coast ;-)  Mark
