This is the explosive of my post.  However, since an anarchy will have
little problem with cheap, well-built nuclear reactors, this sort of
material will be commonly available.

 &gt;You also need special explosives (and thus a dedicated

Gunpowder, if you are using uranium.  Really special, huh?

A $50 trip to Radio Shack for a timer and some miscellaneous parts.

Hm.  Will Ted Taylor do?  He was a nuke designer at Los Alamos,
and says in _The Curve of Binding Energy_ that it would be trivial 
for a high school machine shop to build a nuke, and that all you
need to design a gun type device is in any decent public library
(did you know that you can interlibrary loan the _Plutonium Handbook_,
two very large and thick books on how to process plutonium and
every useful chemical compound involving it?).  He even gives a
design for a gun type, that would fit in a typical garbage can.  Not
elegant, you know, but hey...

<p>
<a href="3508.html#3534qlink5">&gt;&gt;large test range where you can try out the</a><br>
prototypes.

<p>
Not only are gun type devices very reliable and predictable,
but IIRC, no detonation of a nuclear device has ever failed,
that we know of.  Yields may vary, but you can be sure it will
go bang.

<p>
<a href="3508.html#3534qlink6">&gt;Now, I'm sure all of these things will become less expensive as technology</a><br>

<i>&gt;operations, which means we would need to re-evaluate the whole subject from</i><br>
<i>&gt;the ground up.</i><br>

<p>
This is exactly what I've been saying.  All you need for this scenario is
a fairly large market in such things.

Bloated, even more than it is now.
