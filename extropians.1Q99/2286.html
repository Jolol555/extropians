No, it just means I'm trying to avoid starting an argument about animal
sentience by phrasing the issue narrowly.

<p>
Ah.  I see.  I think its the word "inviolable" that does it.

<p>
<a name="2292qlink1">If you simply want to make sure they think morality is important, and that
they start out with a solid understanding of human ideas about morality,
then I think you've got the right idea.  If you want to devote special
effort to ensuring that a few core ideas, like "don't kill people without a
really, really pressing reason" are given a high level of priority, that is
only reasonable.  I think there are real dangers in getting overambitious
about this sort of thing, but that's a different issue.</a>

<p>
<a name="2292qlink2">Perhaps the line could be re-worded to avoid this confusion?  Something like
"In the first case, we could make sure that they possess a thorough
understanding of, and respect for, existing human moral codes that emphasize
respect and toleration of others." would seem to convey your intended
meaning without the possibility of confusion.</a>
