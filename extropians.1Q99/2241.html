So now if you are caught driving drunk in New York City, you
<a name="2244qlink1">get your car impounded.  If you are acquitted, you might *still*
lose your car!  Today's San Jose Mercury quotes Mayor Giuliani:

<p>
"Let's say somebody is acquitted, and it's one of those acquittals
in which the person is guilty, but there is just not quite enough
evidence beyond a reasonable doubt," the mayor said.  "That might
be a situation in which the car would still be forfeited."</a>

<p>
hmmmm.  Yes, mayor, let's say someone is acquitted.  Let us
say that over and over until you finally get it!  }8-[   I would
be reluctant to drive anything the cops might want to own while
in New York City.  It is comments like this one that drives one
to the Libertarian party.  spike
