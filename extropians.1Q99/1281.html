<a href="1273.html#1281qlink1">&gt; So, if not as a scientist, then how else do you think an</a><br>
<i>&gt;individual can further the cause of researching a way to slow or reverse</i><br>
<i>&gt;the aging process? What do you think the field of biological gerontology</i><br>
<i>&gt;needs most from laymen sympathizers? Or, are there any alternative paths</i><br>
<i>&gt;to serious research that don't depend heavily on school transcripts and</i><br>
<i>&gt;recommendations from professors? If you were me, what would you do?</i><br>

<p>
The ONLY thing you will ever be really good at, is doing what interrests you
the most. Do that all the time and make it a living. It is probably one of
the shurest ways to riches. Make a bundle of money this way and invest some
of them in biotech companies or give them away to research.

<p>
You dont have to work directly in age research to help make the biggest
advances in that field. Just fill out your own ecological niche but do it
the best you can, and just make shure that it doesn't work against you
ultimate goal.

I have found that in life the shortest paht between two points is a
zigzag'in line that heads sort of in the right direction.
