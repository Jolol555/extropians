This is just the ATV (Aerial Test Vehicle) to test approach and landing,
the basic airframe, control software and the like (as well as proving to
investors that they can deliver a product on time and under budget).  They
have 3 more airframes under construction:  1 for ground testing (my guess
is structural, fueling and heating tests) and the PTV I and PTV II
(Propulsion Test Vehicle).  PTV I will use a small conventional rocket
motor and fly sub-orbital to test the structure, TPS, attitude control,
<a name="2666qlink1">and the rotor folding (yes, they will still fold the rotor for take-off).
PTV II will be the final prototype, testing the rotary engine all the way
to orbit.
