It's currently a show of intellectual bravado to claim that one is
comfortable with randomness.  Perhaps some believe that we're so 'in touch'
with the universe that our only unsolved problem is that of getting
something from nothing.  This, to me, seems arrogant to the point of being
wrong.

<p>
It's not that I don't like that God plays dice it's that I'm not eager to
attribute everything to indeterminacy at such an early stage.  To accept
chance as doctrine is to give up on a problem.

<a name="3833qlink1">(The reason I asked the original question was because I had been given the
impression that MWI gave a better explanation of the observer problem than
other interpretations.  Clearly it does not.)
