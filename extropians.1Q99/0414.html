And the answer of "Is it good or evil to kill someone" is that the question
is meaningless, since there is no objective definition of the terms
involved.

<p>
Reality will determine whether the sun travles around the earth of
visa/versa, it will tell us the exact goings on in any particular situation,
it will tell us whether an item is longer than another, or who killed
another person.  But it will not tell us whether any of these is a 'good' or
a 'bad' thing, because these two words denote opinions and have no relation
whatsoever to reality, except as filterered through a persons brain.
