  IAN: Well, death serves some purpose, which is
  not to say that we couldn't evolve beyond death.

<a href="1480.html#1511qlink2">&gt;&gt; As Nobel physicist Max Plank said about evolution in science:</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; opponents and making them see the light, but rather because</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; up that is familiar with the idea from the beginning."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;He was probably (not necessarily completely) joking. There are plenty</i><br>
<i>&gt;of revolutions in science that occur much faster than people die</i><br>
<i>&gt;off. Just look at quantum mechanics, relativity, Gödel's theorem and</i><br>
<i>&gt;so on.</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: But consider that every year new professors
  are created, such that the influx of youth is a
  continuous feature, and I suspect that we would
  find that the new paradigms would tend to enter 
  and infiltrate the academic community with the 
  entry and infiltration of youth; and most of 
  the hold outs against change will tend to be 
  the older professors. I suspect that's true
  and if so, then Plank's observation is both 
  rather cynical and scientifically accurate.
