I find it hard to believe some of the postings on this subject.

<p>
<a name="2579qlink1">I may be new to this list, but I was under the impression that
extropians valued free thinking, free speech, learning about all areas
of life and science, accepting the importance (and usefulness) of
hearing points of view which differ to your own own.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2579qlink2">Now, it seems like some kind of clique are trying to claim the list as
their own personal  chat room, by either setting up democratic
censorship or just simply buying the thing outright.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2579qlink3">Apologies if I have miunderstood anyones intent, but the tone of the
postings has seemed to me very suspect. I don't care if someone's
grammar or spelling aren't too clever - they still have a right to
express their point of view - do you want people to pass an entrance
test before being allowed to post to the list?
</a>

<p>
In principle the prefixes are a good idea, although so many of the
<a name="2579qlink4">discussions are linked in ways which cross over the boundaries that I
think it might be a little hard (and misleading) to enforce.
