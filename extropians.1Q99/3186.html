Thats right, Mike.  This is why I posted that any measured proper motion
is experimental error.  There were plenty of indications, even before
the Hipparcos data, that quasars were distant and energetic, waaay
extragalactic phenomena, specifically their enormous redshift.  There
was, and perhaps still is, debate that quasars are associated with
relatively near galaxies to an extent that is statistically significant, but
I sure dont see how they could be, with all that red shift.  Halton Aarp
I think is the name of the guy who was proposing that notion.  spike
