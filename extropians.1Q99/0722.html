<i>&gt; &gt; careful scrutiny; those people who tried to write</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; longer analyses realized it's all bunk and gave up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Part of the problem is the nature of the topics we discuss.  Honestly, how</i><br>
<i>&gt; many of us are qualified to write a rigorous analysis of a topic that spans</i><br>
<i>&gt; half a dozen disciplines?</i><br>

Yes, even if we founded a School of Transhuman Studies on a campus somewhere,
there would still be a large number of people who are merely fans/advocates who
would not at that point be students, faculty, or researchers actively involved.
<a name="0822qlink1">Better yet, why has there not been an establishment of formal classes in
transhuman studies over the internet? I would love to participate in such
courses, but I think it would be up to established faculty like Robin Hanson,
Max More, Alex Chislenko, and others to create such a curriculum.</a> If you guys
want to start the School of Transhuman Studies, I will provide whatever start
up space that is needed on the servers of my company (we are launching an
e-commerce ISP, to go online in a few months), unless you want to put it under
the ExI site.
