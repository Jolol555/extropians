ya, ive followed your argument, but the way i would explain the
report is a kind of one way tendency by the investigators
to underreport the plunge time.  their motives would not
need to be evil.  i would suppose many or most of the
passengers survived the original blast, and no one wants
to even imagine those poor folks living long under those
horrifying conditions of being in a burning plane plunging
toward the sea.  i figured they just picked the most optimistic
(shortest) estimate of descent time.

<p>
the idea of an explosion originating *inside* a fuel tank, that really
bothers me tho.  why couldnt it happen again?  {8-[  spike
