  IAN: Let's recall again that the plane was 
  at REST at the peak of a climb before it fell.
  Not only is that consistent with basic physics, 
  but review the video to see the peaked jet sit 
  on the peak, attain a negative AoA, and then 
  fall. Trying to get around that is futile.
  Your 400-mph jet just does not exist!

<p>
<a name="1953qlink1">  IAN: Mike, what I said is what I quoted from 
  a physics book, how could that be my discovery? 
  Every basic physics book covers the same fact.</a> 
  Your examples show you need to do more research.
  The object with initial horizontal velocity 
  strikes HARDER than the one dropped from rest,
  even as they both strike at THE SAME TIME.
  The horizontal velocity is translated into
  the harder strike, NOT into a faster fall.

<i>&gt;I can dispute those numbers. If the plane is moving at 400 mph and suddenly</i><br>
<i>&gt;begins to climb, it will translate a large percentage of its velocity to</i><br>
lift,
<br>
<a href="1926.html#1942qlink5">&gt;and the remaining forward velocity to drag (aerodynamic and</a><br>
gravitational), as it
<br>
<a href="1926.html#1942qlink6">&gt;climbs. It will top out within 5 seconds it will have gone around 2000</a><br>
feet at
<br>
<i>&gt;the very least. </i><br>


<p>
  IAN: Don't dispute math with words.
 

<p>
<a href="1926.html#1942qlink7">&gt;The fact that its engines were still running would also have</a><br>
<i>&gt;added thrust to the vehicle, which would have added the remaining  </i><br>
<i>&gt;thousand feet to the climb, </i><br>

<p>
  IAN: That's wild speculation. Jet-engine operation 
  depends upon the proper angle of attack of the relative 
  wind, and thus, to quote an aviation mechanic, "when the 
  engines pitch up the compressors stall and the engine 
  flames out unless laminar airflow is restored rapidly."


<p>
<a href="1926.html#1942qlink8">&gt;Listen buddy, the math doesn't lie. I'll reveiw the video again tonite,</a><br>
but as I
<br>
<a href="1926.html#1942qlink9">&gt;recall, they did not specify what part of the plane hit first, just that the</a><br>
<i>&gt;first parts did hit at 29 seconds...</i><br>

<p>
  IAN: That must be about the fifth errant 
  claim you've used to support the CIA case.

<p>
  Watch the video again.
