<i>&gt;=== The Scoop ===============================</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Getting The Internet Off The Ground And Into Orbit</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By WAYNE RASH </i><br>
<i>&gt;InternetWeek</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;InternetWeek contributor Alyson Behr looked at the pilot seated next to</i><br>
<i>&gt;her as he described the proper operation of the spacecraft in which she</i><br>
<i>&gt;was seated. Behr, a world-class aerobatic pilot in her own right, was</i><br>
<i>&gt;seated in the command seat of the Roton ATV, a new type of spacecraft</i><br>
<i>&gt;that's about to revolutionize commercial spaceflight, and in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;process, the Internet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Behr studied the control console of the Roton while she placed her hand</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the stick and her feet on the rudder pedals of the spacecraft. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;company's pilot was describing the landing sequence of the craft, a</i><br>
<i>&gt;process that's unique because this spaceship lands like a helicopter.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But that's not the only thing that's unique about the Roton.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In its efforts to make the Roton significantly more reliable and less</i><br>
<i>&gt;expensive than any other spacecraft, the Rotary Rocket Co.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(www.rotaryrocket.com) has completely changed the way spacecraft work</i><br>
<i>&gt;and how they are designed. For example, the Roton was designed over the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Internet. In fact, the basic concept of low-cost, single-stage</i><br>
<i>&gt;spaceflight was conceived on the Internet, and when it's finished, one</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the first missions of the Roton will be to launch the low-orbit</i><br>
<i>&gt;satellites of the next decade that will support the next generation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;wireless Internet communications.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The significant cost of putting satellites into orbit has been one of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the major barriers to cheap wireless connectivity for a couple of years</i><br>
<i>&gt;now. Once, the cost of the satellites themselves created an additional</i><br>
<i>&gt;barrier, but as today's specialized communications satellites grow in</i><br>
<i>&gt;number, their individual costs drop. Now, major corporations can afford</i><br>
<i>&gt;dozens. But for global Internet access, there must be hundreds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;satellites in orbit around the Earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately, the cost of launching these communications satellites</i><br>
<i>&gt;hasn't dropped enough to make them affordable to any but the most</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;wealthy companies. Rotary Rocket wants to change that by cutting the</i><br>
<i>&gt;cost of getting into orbit by a factor of something like a thousand.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To accomplish such a dramatic cost savings, the Roton must be more than</i><br>
<i>&gt;just reliable. It must operate with a cost structure similar to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;commercial airliner. It must fly out of airports, land at airports, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a ground crew that numbers in the dozens instead of the tens of</i><br>
<i>&gt;thousands. Designing such a vehicle took a lot of engineering talent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and in many cases, these were engineers who didn't want to spend their</i><br>
<i>&gt;lives at Rotary Rocket's test site in Mojave, Calif.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To satisfy the requirements of the engineers, as well as of the company</i><br>
<i>&gt;officials located at the Redwood City, Calif., headquarters,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Internet-based collaboration became a necessity. The project wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;wait while packages were sent by Federal Express. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sending a fax might be fast enough, but performing engineering by fax</i><br>
<i>&gt;isn't a good solution, and it doesn't generate electronic copies of</i><br>
<i>&gt;documents and drawings.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One company official explained that the Internet became integral to</i><br>
<i>&gt;Rotary Rocket's collaborative operation. They simply could not have</i><br>
<i>&gt;designed the Roton as quickly or as inexpensively any other way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The role of the Internet is deep in the culture of the spacecraft</i><br>
<i>&gt;designers. Years ago, small groups of scientists and engineers began to</i><br>
<i>&gt;question the necessity of building huge rockets that were simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;disposed of after their first use. Such waste ensured that access to</i><br>
<i>&gt;space would remain expensive, and would remain beyond the reach of most</i><br>
<i>&gt;people. So they began discussions over the Internet to come up with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;different way. Eventually those discussions led to experiments, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;ultimately those experiments led to Rotary Rocket and its Roton. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now, the company and its rocket are about to return the favor by</i><br>
<i>&gt;helping to launch the satellites that will make the Internet affordable</i><br>
<i>&gt;to everyone. First, of course, there will be some test flights. Those</i><br>
<i>&gt;initial attempts will allow the craft to rise only a few inches or</i><br>
<i>&gt;feet, but later the Roton ATV will fly thousands of feet into the air.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Then in a few months, a new Roton will be built, and it will fly into</i><br>
<i>&gt;orbit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Once that happens, the circle will be complete. The spaceship that was</i><br>
<i>&gt;created in the minds of Internet users, and designed through</i><br>
<i>&gt;collaboration on the Internet, will take on a new role in creating a</i><br>
<i>&gt;new part of the Internet. While it's still a few months off, it won't</i><br>
<i>&gt;be long before the Roton rises above Mojave, Calif., to help create a</i><br>
<i>&gt;new stage in Internet communications. </i><br>
