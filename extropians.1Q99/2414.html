Jason,

<p>
    You brought up some good questions about just what is the use of a God
based cosmology, not wasting time which would decrease efficiency, and not
creating memes which would mask possibilities.  Allow me to make a few
comments on them.


<OL>
<a name="2429qlink1">  <li>  Just what use is a God-based cosmology? - Well, for one thing, if it turns
out that there is a God who played an intricate role in the formation of the
Universe, then I think you would need to have a cosmology which takes this
into account at hand so you would have a better understanding of the Universe.
Now, there is no good proof currently that this is the case, but given that we
still, to the best of my knowledge, understand why there is a Universe to
begin with, we can not completely rule out the possibility of it having been
designed in some manner, and should work out some cosmologies based on this
option (as well as ones which do not include a God or gods) and see which is
the best fit at any one time based on our understanding of the Universe.</a>  And
<a name="2429qlink2">apart from cosmology, I am sure that if we were to discover a God, we would be
able to find some use for such a being.  Maybe as a Universal Lifeguard to
catch any unwary posthumans who bite off more than they can chew (I TOLD you
we were too close to that event horizon!).</a>

<a name="2429qlink3">  <li>  Efficiency is not always the most desirable attribute in any system.  For
example, sometimes power is.  I could have the most fuel efficient car in the
Indy 500, but I bet I would still lose to those gas guzzlers, even with their
pit stops.  And what is an efficient use of time now may not be so efficient
under future conditions; that is why it is good to have a variety of
approaches to any problem, even if it costs you more in time at the onset to
develop them.</a>

<a name="2429qlink4">  <li>  Don't develop a meme which masks the possibilities - I whole-heartedly
agree, but doesn't this work both ways?  I don't want to create a "God" meme
which keeps me blind to "Atheistic" possibilities, but I also don't want to
create a "Atheism" meme which masks "Theistic" possibilities.  I think the
most important thing is to attach a "Fallibility" meme to either approach; no
matter how right I think I am, there is always the possibility that I am
wrong.  The Tolerance meme and Curiosity meme would also be useful to both
worldviews; even if I am right, its okay for others to think they are
right...and hey, why DO they think they are right?  I think if we provide
these supporting memes, we have lowered the risk of any other meme masking</a> the
possibilities.


</OL>
<p>
Now, I've put these points in a lighter tone than some of my previous
posts...just in that kind of mood, but they are as serious as any others I
have made to date.  I do not believe it is of value for Transhumanism to have
ANY set stance on the existence or non-existence of God(s), but it would be
wise to consider all the possibilities and what actions to take in any given
scenario.  Then again, maybe by the time the subject comes up, our posthuman
descendants will be able to wing it, but I prefer to be prepared.
