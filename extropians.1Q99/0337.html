<p>
So it seems that if we were to find a definition of "good" you would
accept the possibility of an objective morality?
Would an example of something that *everyone* considers "good"
do, in the absence of a formal definition?

<p>
<i>&gt;We at least have evidence that these theories do not contradict.  Moral</i><br>

<p>
Once we were agreed upon a definition (or example, per above)
for "good", any such theory could be tested to see whether it
produced more "good", no?  So this problem reduces to the 
previous one.
