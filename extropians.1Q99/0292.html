billy, ive sure spotted a hell of a lot of em in my own.  {8^D

many of you have patiently seen me brain barfing over launchers and
how difficult and expensive it is to climb out of this gravity well we
evolved in, but this is what got me interested in nanotech to start with.
if we admit orbit is inherently difficult and there are no royal roads
to interstellar travel, then the most promising technique is aggressive
downsizing of payload.  nanotech could blast away problems that
defeated generations of rocket scientists.  hope so.  spike
