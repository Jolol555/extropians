Actually, this used to be more commonplace in many e-mailers.  The
problem is that to have this work, you have to allow outside people to
query your machine and see if the username sending the e-mail is a real
username on your machine.  Most large ISPs, such as AT&amp;T, specifically
block queries into their domain from the outside.  Thus, you can't do
the lookups anymore.  When this started happening, people started
complaining that valid e-mail from certain domains was being blocked by
the e-mail servers.  So they took out the features.

<p>
A compromise used in some mail servers was to produce a warning header
that shows a warning if the user could not be verified, or a warning if
the sending machine is not the same as the "From:" field machine.  Most
products don't do this, because the warnings sounded scary and were
often applied to legitimate mail.

<p>
Today, I think most people have given up trying to autodetect spam or
false mail.  Many ISPs offer filtering programs that leave the spam
filtering up to their users, so that the ISP is never blamed for doing
the wrong thing.  There are pros and cons to every scheme of spam
blocking, and I don't know any that are worth it to me to use.  The
side-effects of the spam-blocking usually are worse for me than handling
the spam after I get it.
