The mail and wire fraud laws are very, very good examples of why spamming
laws are a really bad idea. Just take a look sometime at the numerous cases
where these laws are used for things they were never intended to cover; back
when I kept up with the hacking press, it seemed that practically every US
hacker caught was charged with wire fraud with its high penalties, even 
though the crime was never intended to apply to hacking.

Oh get real. Late time I checked the average murderer spent about eight
years in jail; you want to put spammers in jail for longer than murderers!?
Do you have any idea how much these kind of laws are screwing up the US
legal system? Next time someone's accused of spamming they'll just come
out shooting, because they'll have nothing to lose...</a>

<p>
This list is really going downhill.
