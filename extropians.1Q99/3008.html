<a href="2988.html#3008qlink1">&gt;I just got in an arguement with an antigun nut.  He SAYS he's open to reason</a><br>
<i>&gt;and would like some statistics. I don't beleive him but given the faint</i><br>
<i>&gt;possibility that he might be telling the truth I was wondering if anyone on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the list might tell me of some URL's that would be useful to me.</i><br>

John Lott's recent book has really shaken up a lot of policy wonks.  I doubt
much of it is available on the web, though, except via purchase through Amazon
or the like.

<p>
The Cato Institute has a ton of downloadable papers and a handy search engine
to help you find just what you want.  I recall reading a fine paper on gun
control published circa 1990.

Facts seldom hurt an argument, but do not neglect the moral angle:  We each of
us have a duty to protect ourselves and our loved ones.  To strip others of
their rights to exercise that duty commits a grievous wrong.  I think it
wholly fair, moreover, to charge gun-grabbers with a sort of cowardly
ignorance:<a name="3013qlink1">  Fearful of taking up the burden of self-defense, they wishfully
imagine that they can avoid the problem by delegating that duty to third
parties.
