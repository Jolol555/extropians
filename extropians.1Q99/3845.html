I'd certainly agree with that.

IMO, it is a natural result of the fact that a government bureaucracy is in
charge of education.<a name="3880qlink1">  They have no incentive to even care about whether
their methods work, and every incentive to fiercely resist any effort to
change the system.</a>

<p>
Actually, the U.S. spends quite a lot of money on education.  Teachers are
paid above-average wages (especially considering that 3-month vacation every
year), and the only schools that don't have basic materials are the ones
where the bureaucrats intercept all of the money before it reaches</a> the
classroom.  The constant complaints about funding are another natural result
of bureaucracy - we could spend $1,000,000 a year per student, and they
would still claim to be short of money.

<p>
Having worked as a teacher, I would say that money is largely irrelevant.
Once you have a classroom, furniture, books and a teacher, you have
everything money can buy that is actually helpful.  Spending vast sums on
computers, multimedia tools, field trips, and so on produces very little
benefit - what really matters is what the teacher and students do in that
classroom.
