Three popular alternatives to imprisonment are:
<pre>
* community service
* home detention (see <a href="http://homedetention.com">http://homedetention.com</a> for example)
* fines/restitution

</pre>
<p>
I think chemical castration is somewhat less popular, and
only applies to sex offenders.  A novel punishment for
chronic abusers of the opposite sex:  a sex change
operation.

<p>
Popular in some parts:
<pre>
* caning or other non-permanent physical punishment
* permanent physical punishment (e.g., chop of a hand)
* tattoo 'POOR IMPULSE CONTROL' and the like on offenders'
</pre>
  foreheads :)

<p>
Swift execution is also popular in some parts.  The death
penalty as used in some U.S. states involves much more
imprisonment than death.

<p>
The most straightforward and effective reform would of course
be to legalize drugs.  People who buy, produce, sell, or use
drugs shouldn't be penalized at all, let alone imprisoned.

<p>
If we accept that some people must be imprisoned...
* To get the 'invisible hand' working on the problem, make payments
  to private prison operators partially contingent on recidivism
  rates for prisoners released from the facility in question.
* We may want to look closely at claims that some make about
  meditation decreasing violence in prisons and improving
  rehabilitation.  See for example <a href="http://www.dhamma.org/prisons.htm">http://www.dhamma.org/prisons.htm</a>
  and <a href="http://www.natural-law.org/98_platform/98_platform_crime.html">http://www.natural-law.org/98_platform/98_platform_crime.html</a>.
* Make prison more of a 'punishment' -- remove all televisions
  and radios and feed them a vegan diet (these would make
  prison more palatable for me, but probably not for most
  actual prisoners).
