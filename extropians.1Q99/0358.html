<p>
that would be the case with such rules in effect.  Well, if the owner
agreed to a three post maximum.

<p>
<a href="0335.html#0358qlink2">&gt;&gt;The second is a limit on the size of each post.  This enforce trimming</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;posts, so that members don't quote the whole post, but only the part</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;they wish to respond to.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I try to do this, but frequently (especially in a cogently argued post)</i><br>
<i>&gt;there is not enough context unless you include several layers of argument</i><br>
<i>&gt;back to the original post</i><br>

<p>
Seeing your above example, I noticed you could've trimmed words
-- such as "already," etc. -- without losing much meaning.

<p>
<a href="0335.html#0358qlink3">&gt;&gt;A problem with this is that combined with the post per day limit, the</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;length of a member's daily contribution would be very limited.  Even</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;so, if someone has something lenthy to post, he or she could post</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a (temporary?) URL with the material or ask members to email him</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;or her for copies of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure what the problem with list verbiage is.  I would like to try</i><br>
<i>&gt;and keep subject lines relevant when topics change during conversation (so</i><br>
<i>&gt;people can ignore those threads they aren't interested in), but I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;interested in seeing as many opinions as possible, so I don;t see a problem</i><br>
<i>&gt;with many posts.  Similarly with emails, I'd prefer that each one was long,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but stand-alone (so that when it arrives I can read it as a single argument</i><br>
<i>&gt;and not have to go back through my deleted folder to try and find the email</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's a reply to in order to understand it).</i><br>

<p>
Valid point, and a good argument against too small of a size limit.

<p>
<a href="0335.html#0358qlink4">&gt;I do think that sometimes this sort of thing might work better as a</a><br>
<i>&gt;newsgroup (we do appear to have the volume) and if I had a permanent</i><br>
<i>&gt;connection to the net (as soon as ADSL comes in) I would run a news server</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a couple of news groups on it.</i><br>

<p>
I still believe we should try my suggestions, even if only for a few weeks.
After that, we can keep (one or both of) them or go back to the old way
of doing things.  Such a brief trial would, I think, give us a chance to see
if quality goes up or down without doing much damage if the latter.

<p>
Cheers!
