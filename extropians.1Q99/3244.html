I think you may be looking at the phenomenon backward here, Eli. I doubt that anyone
can claim that Greenspan, Rubin, and the rest of his team have done an outstanding
job managing the economy and rescuing many other countries from the brink of falling
into the Asian morass.

<p>
Where I think astrologers come in is that there are far too many people on Wall
Street who know that there are far too many imbeciles with money in the US who put
more credence in the vague soothsaying of their astrologers and phone psychics than
in economists. The one thing that prevents economists from being more precise is
because of the FUD factor that is produced by such superstitious investing
strategies (FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt).

<p>
<a href="3242.html#3244qlink2">&gt; I believe in science because science has produced technology.  No</a><br>
<i>&gt; technology, it isn't science.  And that also goes for superstring</i><br>
<i>&gt; theory, but physicists get the benefit of the doubt, from the media if</i><br>
<i>&gt; not from me, because vaporizing cities is so impressive.</i><br>

<p>
I think that I figured out why more scientists than ever claim they beleive in god
or some supreme being: scientists are smart enough to realize that by doing so, the
average dope on the street is going to say to himself,"Gee, he is a god fearing man,
he must be ok and trustworthy." So being a beleiver may paradoxically give
scientists more credence in the public's eyes.
