<p>
Both definitions are "reasonable", in the sense that there is a 
lexicographically legitimate usage of the word in both senses.

<p>
<a href="0466.html#0536qlink2">&gt; You might define "communism" as "the belief that all property should be</a><br>

<i>&gt; all about belief?</i><br>

<p>
In the sense I was referring to, yes. -- In contrast to "despotism", 
or "autism", which are not dogmas or belief systems, but other kinds 
of objects.

<p>
<a href="0466.html#0536qlink3">&gt; Okay, so I don't we disagree about very much! Probably just the issue of</a><br>
<i>&gt; whether agnosticism is about knowledge or belief. </i><br>

<p>
We are basically in agreement about agnosticism. Our only point of 
disagreement seems to be that I think the most appropriate definition 
of atheism is: "The belief that there is no god." You seem to prefer 
to define it as: "The absence of belief in a god." I think the 
former definition is the one that corresponds more closely to 
general usage among laypersons as well as theologians. But it's 
just a matter of words. Let's move on to debate something more 
substantial!
