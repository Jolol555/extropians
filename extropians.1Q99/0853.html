<p>
Since I coined the phrase, New Golden Rule, in an earlier post allow me
to comment.

<p>
"Do unto others as they would have you do unto them" does not, IMO, ignore
the relationship between you and your fellow human.  In fact, it explicitly
takes
<br>
your fellow human into consideration whereas the old rule seems more one-
sided.  I'm in general agreement with Harvey Newstrom who stated,
"No, the old golden rule was a perfect excuse for projecting one's morality
onto others."

<p>
Dave Kekich offered,

<p>
"Stay out of my life, and I'll stay out of your's."

<p>
There are too many exceptions to this one.  (e.g. If I'm on fire, I
definitely want
<br>
you to come into my life, hopefully with an extinguisher, and an invitation
is
<br>
NOT required.

<a href="0783.html#0853qlink2">&gt;Arguably, this "projective" capacity is the foundation of the</a><br>
<i>&gt;rule to begin with.  The idea, as expressed by modern cog sci scholars,</i><br>
goes
<br>
<a href="0783.html#0853qlink3">&gt;something like this:  We developed the ability to hold a model of the world</a><br>
<i>&gt;around us in our heads to make decisions, and as a byproduct of this</i><br>
<i>&gt;"projective" ability, we learned to project, or model, our own experience</i><br>
of
<br>
<a href="0783.html#0853qlink4">&gt;humanity to other humans...i.e. creating a model of what its like to be us</a><br>
<i>&gt;and projecting it on them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Forget multiculturalism, thats just a small example of the differences that</i><br>
<i>&gt;arise between our subjective, lonely, isolated minds.  Even people who</i><br>
share
<br>
<a href="0783.html#0853qlink5">&gt;a similar cultural heritage have differing wants and needs, so different in</a><br>
<i>&gt;fact, that we cannot begin to second guess their desires.  Descarte</i><br>
<i>&gt;understood this when he articulated the golden rule as he did...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do unto others _just as_ you would have them do unto you.  The statement is</i><br>
<i>&gt;intended more to express the ideal relationship between individuals than to</i><br>
<i>&gt;dictate specific behaviors.  It can be processed on many levels.  i.e.  "I</i><br>
<i>&gt;will give you, Mr. Pacifist, a punch in the face because I would have you</i><br>
<i>&gt;punch me, Mr. Masochist, in the face."  but by that same token, "I will not</i><br>
<i>&gt;do to you, Mr. Pacifist, what you do not want me, Mr. Masochist, to do to</i><br>
<i>&gt;you, because I would not do to you, what I would not want you to do to me."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The golden rule should be seen to operate on this second, "higher level"...</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe somebody out there could better express what I'm trying to get at</i><br>
with
<br>
<i>&gt;this.</i><br>


<p>
I agree with you that this higher order meaning is satisfactory.  I don't
know
<br>
if this is a better expression or not, but I could restate it as . . .

<p>
    "I will give careful consideration to your desires and dispositions
before I
<p>
     interact with you, because I would want you to act in the same
respectful
<p>
     manner toward me."

<p>
The problem is that the common interpretation of the Old Golden Rule is not
on this meta level, but rather is frequently used to further one's own
agenda,
<br>
as Mr. Newstrom explained with several good examples. The average person
would have a more difficult time justifying selfish actions if the higer
order
<br>
interpretation were somehow made more explicit than it currently is.  The
statement above is also stated in a positive, proactive manner (as suggested
by Mr. Gobel).

<p>
The version offered in quotes above solves this problem.  It does not
obligate
<br>
you to do "anything" another may request of you, it obligates you to give
respectful consideration to their request.  Further, it obligates you to
consider
<br>
unspoken requests (e.g. please don't make jokes about to my weight).

<p>
Unfortunately, the quote offered above is hardly a snappy one and is not
likely
<br>
to catch on.  Then again, it's the snappy quotes that tend to be inflexible
and too
<br>
black_and_white.
