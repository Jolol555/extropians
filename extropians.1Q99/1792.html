<a name="1803qlink1">Likewise, "physical causation" has at least the following meanings: 
Thermodynamic causality,</a> or using Occam's Razor to deduce that the
direction of time is from smaller to larger probability volumes;
relativistic causality, or the direction of time as determined by
gravitation; mathematical causality, which you call "logical
implication", but which also explains the verifiable fact that one
planet plus one planet equals two planets; static logical causality,
which refers to deductions operating on an instantaneous data-set using
non-temporal rules; temporal logical causality, which refers to
deductions predicting future states of a data set which evolves
continuously or discretely according to process rules.

<p>
Let's see Lojban distinguish between _that_.  Incidentally, this isn't a
complete list.

<p>
Anyway, of all these forms of causality, the only one that I believe is
objectively real is relativistic causality; all the others are
simplifications therefrom.  No, let me strike that:  The only one which
_might possibly_ be real is relativistic causality.

<p>
<a name="1803qlink2">I don't believe in any form of logical or mathematical justification. 
Anything real is an experimentally detectable physical process.</a>  That
also goes for the reason why anything exists at all.  The reason why
physical processes exist will itself be a physical process, not a
logical argument or a mathematical equation.  Nor will physics ever be
able to explain all presently observable processes until this reason is known.

<p>
I don't believe in things that aren't experimentally detectable; there
is a reason why anything exists at all; ergo that reason is
experimentally detectable; QED.

<p>
Eganic, yes, but there's a reason why "Greg Egan" is the superlative
conjugation of "SF author".
