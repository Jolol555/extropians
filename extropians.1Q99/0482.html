So have I, it may surprise you to know. I don't speak of morality, but</a> of
ethics.

<p>
<a name="0487qlink3"><a href="0469.html#0482qlink3">&gt;and based my actions around aesthetics - ie what I liek and dislike.</a><br>

<p>
Rather short-sighted, if you ask me. There are lots of things I don't like
that I nevertheless realize are good for me. Flu shots, for instance.</a>

<p>
<a name="0487qlink4">I think prudence makes a much firmer grounding for ethical principles than

<p>
That's certainly a wise heuristic.

<p>
Samael responds:
<br>
<a href="0469.html#0482qlink7">&gt;Life is almost entirely Carbon Hydrogen and Oxygen, with a few trace</a><br>
<i>&gt;elements.</i><br>

<p>
Uh, thanks for enlightening me. :-) (More accurately, life is the chemical
reactions undergone by those elements in certain combinations.)

<p>
Now could you answer my question? What does it mean to say that carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen and trace elements "include" life? It's more the other way
around, isn't it? I was just trying to point out that your comment, meant
as a rejoinder to my statement that your property includes your life,
failed to connect.
