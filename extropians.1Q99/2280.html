I couldnt help noting the reference to television and crime in  South =
Africa since 1976. The reason we took so long to adopt it is because of  =
a government minister named Jaap Marais  He said that television was an =
instrument of  the devil. He feared that by showing programs that =
encouraged racial mixing (american) television would undermine the =
religeous and political systems( this man is a little bit to the right =
of your David Duke! ) only after he left the government to form his own  =
political party did we finally start to get television in sa.The crime =
issue is probably unrelated because as time went on the people became =
increasingly brutalised to the extent where we stopped thinking of each =
other as human(I mean this quite literally) We have picked up some very =
bad memes over the years
