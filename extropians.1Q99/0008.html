It does sound a bit too flimsy, yes. Reminds me a bit of Game of Life
machines like the adder or prime calculator - complex patterns that
will break down if subjected to too much (i.e. any ) noise. But in a
Dysonian asymptotic head death universe noise might indeed be very
low. I would really like to see if we could come up with more
theoretical applied science designs for intelligent structures that
can live in this era, or even in the cold period after the stars.

&gt; No, just one particular feature.  The current model holds that there was one<br>

OK, that is actually fairly easy to explain. Where would another big
bang occur? Note that it was a creation and expansion of spacetime, it
didn't occur inside a pre-existing spacetime. So the closest thing to
a new big bang would be the budding off of a baby universe, but all
models so far suggests that this doesn't change our universe much
(some gravity waves from the collapsing navel wormhole). Conservation
of energy is locally upheld, so you need some rather extreme changes
to our theories in order to get a huge explosion inside our spacetime
(baby universe creation and all that of course gets away with their
stuff due to the weird properties of global relativity, where energy
isn't conserved).
