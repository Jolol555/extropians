I believe what I'm trying to do is keep you honest with your statistics. My
point is that if we used guns as much as we used bathrooms, there would be
more gun deaths. I believe you're  the one trying to manipulate the
statistics in this case by saying that guns are safer than bathrooms. One of
the main reasons I'm not at high risk of being eaten by a shark is that I
don't live by the ocean, and the main reason I'm not at high rick of having
a gun accident is that I've never used one.<a name="2837qlink1"> If I carried a gun, as you seem
to be suggesting I should as a law abiding citizen, my risk of dying by my
own gun would probably be higher than me dying in the bathroom.
