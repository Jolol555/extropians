I don't much have a problem with people advocating a kind of
noncoercive socialism, though I honestly don't believe such a society
would last very long - especially not if it was very large.  We can
talk all we like about space stations and voluntary governments, but
those don't exist.  99% of people who advocate socialism advocate
statist socialism which is an advocation of force against peaceful
citizens.
