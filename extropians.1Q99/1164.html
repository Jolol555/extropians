<p>
A GRB won't destroy *all* life.  It would cause a mass extinction, killing
all land-dwelling life on one hemisphere of the planet and (through indirect
effects) a lot of other life in other areas.  It might or might not manage
to kill off land animals on the shadowed side of the planet (by suddenly
destroying the ozone layer and atmospheric composition).  In any case, a
great deal of life will survive in the oceans.

<p>
If GRBs occur every few million years, complex animal life probably can't
evolve.  If it happens every few tens of millions of years, it evolves but
doesn't have time to get very far.  According to the theory, the gap between
successive bursts has only recently become long enough for life forms like
us to evolve.

<p>
I'm not sure if I buy all this or not.

<p>

<i>&gt; if life appears on a planet, intelligent life is a highly probably</i><br>
outcome.
<br>
<i>&gt; Gould assumes the opposite.</i><br>

<p>
Combining 'rare intelligence' with GRB extinctions would certainly make us
rare, though.

<p>
I don't think I but Jay Gould's idea, however.  Look around.  Recently
evolved types of life (mammals, avians) seem to be much smarter than older
ones (reptiles, fish).  There are lots of unrelated species that are smart
enough to make people worry about whether they are sentient or not (apes,
whales, dolphins, elephants, and a couple of species of birds).  The
combination of tool use, intelligence and a capacity for large-scale social
organization might be unusual, but there seems to be a clear trend towards
increasing intelligence.
