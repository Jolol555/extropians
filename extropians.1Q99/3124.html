I agree that putting more stress on the curative effects of technology
would help widespread acceptance of our meme-complex. And we don't just
have to point to the future--it's clear that in the most technologically
advanced countries, pollution has been reduced. Here in Los Angeles, the
air is far cleaner that it was in the 1960 and 70s, despite many more
people and cars. Fish life has been returning to the Great Lakes, and so
on. The more wealth we have, and the more intelligent our technology, the
more easily we can reduce pollution and even restore species.

<a name="3129qlink1">ExI has recognized the importance of this point and at least started to do
something about it. While I understand the sheer reactive, emotional appeal
of Eliezer's line about the rainforests, it's a terribly harmful thing to
say. At Extro 3 we had a session on market-based high environmentalism, and
Greg Burch has some excellent writing on his web site on this topic. I
would like to see a specific section for extropian thinking on the
environment on ExI's web site.</a>
