Well, I'll volunteer to HTML-ize at least the first few topics, if we can
get some agreement on what they should be.  Here are a few suggestions that
seem to stir up controversy:

<p>
What kind of government would Extropians prefer to see in the future?
Is human-equivalent AI really possible?
<br>
How can we avoid being 'taken over' by future posthumans (especially SIs)?
Is personal security possible in a nanotech world?
Is personal privacy possible in a nanotech world?

<p>
What else should be on the list?

<p>
<a href="2830.html#2854qlink2">&gt; 	Personally, I'd like some kind of system where we accumulate</a><br>

<i>&gt; of the system.  Let me know what you think and if you'd like to see</i><br>
<i>&gt; something like this set up for this list..</i><br>

<p>
I love the idea.  I'm not sure if this implementation would actually get
used in this group or not - I suspect that a lot of our non-hacker
compatriots would be put off by the interface.  Still, it might be worth a
try.

<p>
IMO, the ideal would be a program like yours with an interactive HTML front
end.  Of course, that calls for some pretty significant programming - I
could do it on a PC, but I understand the ExI site is on a Unix server.
