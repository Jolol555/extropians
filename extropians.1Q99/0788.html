<a name="0799qlink1">US Federal Trade Commission:  another spammer for your investigation list

<p>
Sprintlink:  your customer, estop.net aka thephoenix.net aka
hoster.eroticaworld.net appear to be another group of Florida career
spammers.  They are spamvertizing webpages and have intentionally hidden
their identity to the best of their (limited) ability.  Please enforce your
AUP and terminate 208.17.14.0/24 / NETBLK-SPRINT-D0110E-1 / ESTOP2-DOM for
theft of electronic services and trespassing upon a chattel (see AOL v.
Cyberpromo or Compuserve v. Cyberpromo for court definition of spam
offences) BTW pls. note that the reply-to address would never get back</a> to
the criminals.
