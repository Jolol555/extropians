is very effective, seems to raise acetylcholine levels and promote new
neural connections and updates old ones too.(old memories-- things you
hadn't thought of in a while come into your awareness again. DMAE works
better if about 2 to 4 hours before taking it you ingest a few hundred
milligrams of pantothenic acid. that gives the B vitamin a chance to
saturate the brain and also clear the stomach. The reaction of DMAE and
pantothenic acid produces the acetylcholine and you don't want that to
happen in your stomach. CrampCity!  There are some side effects---increased
muscle tone-stiff neck; headache, the effects tend to only occur to new
users and decrease on regular use. At least in my experience.
