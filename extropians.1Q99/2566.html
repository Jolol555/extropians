<p>
I agree with everything, except for abortion being the ownership-of-body
argument.  The only issue in abortion is responsibility and expenses for
unborn children.  I wrote a piece on it once (see my website).
People abort pregnancy not because they are worried for their bodies.
The reason usually is, they don't want to have children.
If you suggested them to take the fetus outside their body 
to be brought to term in a vat, their decision would not change.

<p>
So the question is, what is intelligent life and who carries 
responsibility for it.  Imagine what the debate would look like
if humans laid eggs or spawned caviar.

<p>
Body ownership is just a populist argument.
It is the point in body part market debate, but in no way in abortion.
