Who should live?  What is the Extropian value of bringing back old models of
humans?

<p>
First, it depends on your perspective....if you are some future society, then
there may be no value.  Then again, if you are the one hoping to come back,
there is a HECK of a lot of value.  

<p>
But I would argue that there is a value in bringing back the frozen dead
<br>
(besides altruism).  They may not be as smart, or as fast, or many other<br>
things as the future population, but they have two PROVEN qualities.  One is
experience....a fairly rich cache of them, which when incorporated into that
future society, may prove useful.  For example, if the Amazonian Rainforest is
gone, and you're trying to recreate it as a tourist attraction, it might be
useful to hire as consultants some people who actually visited it while still
around to make sure you're getting the "feel" right.  Or let's say we've
finally found some ETs, turns out they are not friendly, but the last war was
outside living memory....unless you spent some time in the deep freeze.  That
hands-on experience of battle mixed in with state of the art might be useful.
Oh, but that sort of ties into the second quality, SURVIVAL.  These relics of
the past are are personalities that were pretty strongly wired to find ways to
escape entropy.  Now, granted, the future may know some ways to program this
in, but these would be truly tested models.  Upgrading the cryonicists and
using them to augment the future's understanding of what it means to be a
fighter, and to beat the odds, may be more valuable than anything else we
could bring to the future.

<p>
Then again, maybe not....but I like to think so, and what is life but the
constant struggle fulfil seemingly futile hope?  

<p>
TRANSCEND!
