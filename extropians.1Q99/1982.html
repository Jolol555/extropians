They are actually suggesting incarcerating people indefinitely, without
trial, for having a personality disorder which may, or may not, cause
the person to be a danger to society.

<p>
Two questions:
<br>
1.  Define 'personality disorder'
<br>
2.  Define 'danger to society'

<p>
This is a gross breach of human rights, and seems another step on the
road to turning Britain into a police state.  The recent Criminal
Justice Act gave the police the right to arrest people for just about
anything (Illegal Assembly: an unauthorised gathering of persons
numbering more than 1)

How about in the UK (as repotted on BBC radio) where they are proposing 
to incarcerate people who might commit a crime in the future.

<p>
In particular, for having a personality disorder. My jaw dropped.

<p>
The polly was saying 
<br>
"in the past people with personality disorders have gone on to hurt 
people and we cannot let this happen again"
+
<br>
"we cannot wait for the science on this one"

<p>
oh right.

<p>
There is massive overlap between the personality disorders themselves 
(comorbidity), and serious (Axis 1 in DSM) disorders such as depression 
and anxiety, as well as with normal personality (the best predictor of 
personality disorder apart from a clinical diagnosis is simply
unusually 
<br>
high levels of emotionality (Neuroticism).

<p>
Essentially, this guy is suggesting that the government be given cart 
blanch to imprison around half of the population. And even then, not on 
the basis of evidence of misdeeds, but by opinions about internal
motives 
<br>
and processes - talk about an invitation for witch hunting.
