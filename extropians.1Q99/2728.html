I haven't read this book (yet)...but I did read his short story which started
it all.  (The Jabber?)...in the author's notes to that story he said exactly
that.  

<p>
That is...given the way that technology was advancing it was impossible to
place any story more than just a few years in the future and expect it to be
anywhere near beleivable.  Because of this he invented the "slowness" as a
plot device to plausibly slow technological advancement.
