     They have got to be the ultimate communications device particularly
if 

<p>
     we can get them down to gnat-size. 

  

<p>
     Bandwidth is the obvious constraint at the moment but somewhere 

<p>
     between satellite LEOS (v2.001k), cels G3 and perhaps the next
generation of GSM we must be getting close. 

  

<p>
     When brainstorming some possible applications I got :- 

  


<UL>
  <li>  great bootleg concert webcasts 

  

  <li>  the ultimate "wish you were here" realtime digital postcard 

  

  <li>  great personal security &amp; deterrent device 


</UL>
<p>
       " Patch me thru to McGarret! ...  Book Him Danno"      &amp; if your
server is down , get a digital mugshot (the Web's Most Wanted?) 

  


<UL>
  <li>  we could all be special correspondents for CNN - no thanks ! 

  

  <li>  &amp; now for the nice stuff        perhaps share your precious
moments ( mountain top sunrises?) with loved-ones 


</UL>
<p>
        &amp;/or the world 

  

<p>
     And for those really mega-events (perhaps the dawn of the 

<p>
     new-millennium somewhere near the DateLine in a Pacific paradise) a
good proportion of 

<p>
     the populace could come close to a feeling of being part of that
often 

<p>
     dreamt about,  ultimate good-vibe of universal consciousness. 

  

<p>
     I'd love to get some dialog going on WWVs and where they may take
us.

<p>
I'd like a wearable one that I could activate on demand if the
authorities or some other thugs pull me over or confront me.  That would
presuppose an uplink to some service that would monitor and record these
events for possible legal/security interaction.  Thousands of Rodney
Kings.

<p>
Why stop there?  In theory, couldn't almost any uplink be provided given
time?  I mean, given the proper attention, any information can be
downloaded:  language translations, medical advice, electronics/technical
support, or even learning supplementals.  If a large effort was geared
towards this, a central station might someday use some sort of
broadcasting technique to give almost any kind of information to anyone
at anytime, kind of like wearing the Internet.
