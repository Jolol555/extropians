<a name="1862qlink1">Any Houston-area cryonicists/wannabes out there want to take a look at
the videotapes of the Nov 98 21st Century Medicine seminar? If so, I
will  be at Borders bookstore on west Westheimer Sunday 2-20-99 with
my videotapes and copies (which you may borrow or view) and copies of
the latest CryoCare Report.</a> 
<br>
Here is the blurb from the email newsletter Texas Atheist:

<p>
"HOUSTON - DARWIN DAY CELEBRATION:  The Secular Humanists of Houston<br>
will have a ‘Darwin Day Celebration' February 20th, 12:00 - 6:00 PM at
the BORDER's Books &amp; Music, 9633A Westheimer, Houston, TX 77063.
Contact  Keith Irish keith.irish@lmco.com "

<p>
For those unfamiliar with the 21CM seminar, the speakers -- cryonics
researchers Greg Fahy, PhD (world-class cryobiologist), Brian Wowk,
PhD, Mike Darwin, and Stever Harris, MD -- discussed in considerable
detail (slides, pre-videotaped analyses,  panel discussion, etc.) the
advances and prospects regarding cryonics research, and related
cryobiological and emergency medicine products and services which may
lead to revenue streams which can be directed to cryonics research.

<p>
Let me know if you can't make it, but still want to view or borrow one
or more of my videotapes (also available from the Life Entension
Foundation).
