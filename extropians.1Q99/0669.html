<p>
What if the mice are programmed to switch from scavenging to actively 
hunting at high population levels, regardless of food availability? I 
<a name="0683qlink2">have no evidence for it, so I'm probably hopelessly incorrect, but I 
could see that *in their natural circumstances* at a low population level 
they'd do well as scavengers but at high population levels they'd have 
to search more actively. Evolution could have built in some suitable
programming based on the population density (e.g. level of mouse scent)
rather than food availability.

<p>
Either way further experimentation would be required to decide the issue;
I don't think it's as clear-cut as you believe.
