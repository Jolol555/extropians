<a href="2354.html#2467qlink1">&gt; As I understand it, your contention is that an entity with a strong</a><br>
<i>&gt; motivation system might be capable of changing it, but would never actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; choose to do so.  Is that substantially correct?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2600qlink1">Yes. If it is sufficiently rational it would not change its basic 
motivations. It may of course rewire specific drives if it thinks 
that would serve some higher-level goal.</a>

<p>
There is one type of situation where this fails though. If the SI 
knew that it was to be subjected to some sort of mind-scan, and that 
it only if it has certain fundamental values would it be allowed to 
survive, then it might replace its old values with new ones, the new 
ones being choosen as that set of values that would (1) allow it to 
pass the test, and (2) lead to the attainment of its old values at 
least as well as any alternative set of values that would pass the 
test (modulo its present knowledge).
