Guess I'll see your two cents and raise three. :)

<p>
<a name="3167qlink1">Consider extending your description: retinal painting *and* three multimode
cameras (binocular from you, plus a face shot); and five sound
channels--binaural to you ("headphones" based on Wolf Ear tech, but made
failsafe), binaural(those "wolf ears" again) + close-mike from you. The
retinal sprayers might look like Ant Man mandibles and sit over your eyes
only as much as a classic Plantronics Starset sits over your mouth. OK so far?</a>

<p>
<a name="3167qlink2">I also want 24/7 record capability with "911"-style parallel
playback-while-record for all channels. That's SMOPD. Ana-Digi cellphone
with silent cuing? Naturalamente.</a>

<p>
<a name="3167qlink3">The rest of your stuff about [not] "needing" I/O devices seems muddled</a> to me.
<a name="3167qlink4">Trackballs drift; I'd suggest a Cat trackpad.</a>

<p>
<a name="3167qlink5">I consider the following to be a partial list of things that would be handy
when I'm trying to move about in the world:

<p>
Proximity detection fields (spare eyes &amp; ears) so I can subcontract my
attention if I am willing to risk it. Realtime orientation and location
data, both center-of-mass and head tracking (twelve degrees of freedom);
somthing that can pass for force feeback (which probably won't actually
*be* force feedback, but can be learned by those motivated) --either
vibratory or galvanic or both; and gestural, voice tone, vital sign and
postural tracking and input. Many of these could possibly be based on
video&amp;laser technology or ubiquitous computing. Some could be built into a
vest or shirt yoke today. Some are being prototyped for the military right
now.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3167qlink6">And there's always Morse code in extremis, and no, I'm not joking.</a>

<p>
Augmented reality *ought* to be more effective than closed-world ("hard") VR.
That especially includes reducing simulator sickess. Ubiquitous computing
or cellular computing *ought* to make AR easier. But that probably puts us
in David Brin privacy territory.

<p>
Having worked in VR and pen computing, I gotta say the RAH quote is right
on the money.

being so

(except
