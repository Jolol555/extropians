This is certainly going to be a big money-maker for some people, but it
doesn't really give the customer what he wants.  Its just the best
substitute our current technology can manage for a reasonable cost.

<p>
<a href="3152.html#3155qlink2">&gt; The first phase could kick in as soon as we have simple audio-video</a><br>

<i>&gt; could possibly be the largest driving force for moving this type of VR</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the mainstream..</i><br>

<p>
If you want to watch a conventional movie on a heads-up display, that's no
big deal (maybe 2-5 years out).  If you want real 3D VR, where you can walk
around and watch from different angles, that means you need a computer
capable of rendering complex models in real time (which means around 10^6
MIPS, which you might have in a home computer around 2012).  If you want the
sim to be controllable (instead of just following a set script), or to
interact with the real environment at all, it also needs a decent physics
simulation to generate dynamic models for things like hair movement, flexing
muscles, and folds in clothing (multiple that MIPS figure by at least 100,
which puts us close to 2020).

<p>
<a href="3152.html#3155qlink3">&gt; Phase two could include tactile simulation.  Wear this suit (fitted</a><br>
<i>&gt; with a "special" cod-piece) and "get some" yourself while you watch.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Hell, participate in multiple-partner sex orgies!  Have sex with real</i><br>
<i>&gt; (simulated) partners from around the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Phase three is the full body immersion VR tanks - as far as you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; tell you're REALLY having sex.</i><br>

<p>
Cool.  The tactile interface doubles the processing load (at least), plus we
now need a good, detailed physics simulation (its also not at all clear that
such a thing is possible without smart matter or real neural interfaces).
We also need a complete sexbot OS &amp; control program for your simulated
partner, so it can do a decent job of pretending to be a person, and we need
to simulate an entire virtual environment instead of just a couple of human
bodies.  Now we're talking 2030 before we can run the software, even on an
optimistic projection.

<p>
<a href="3152.html#3155qlink4">&gt; Sexbots?  Bah.  By the time we can build them VR will be far enough</a><br>
<i>&gt; along to make "real world" sex seem quaint and silly.</i><br>

<p>
High-fidelity VR is much, much more difficult than is commonly believed.  It
demands programs with hundreds of billions of lines of code, simulations
that will eat up TeraFLOPS of processing power, animal-level AI programs,
and extremely complex interface hardware.

<a name="3156qlink1">If you are satisfied with a cartoon-quality world</a> and a very rudimentary
