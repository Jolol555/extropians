I think you take an excessively narrow-minded view here.  IMHO, what Max is
trying to do is define extropianism as a process, rather than a specific set
of goals.  Extropianism is supposed to be about making life better - for as
many people as possible, by as much as possible.  It is not about telling
people what kind of life they should want.

<p>
This is simply a recognition that our current knowledge is limited.  We
don't know, in any provable sense, exactly what form of government would be
best for humans (let alone transhumans, or posthumans).  Intelligent people
with very similar values will disagree about whether our goal should be pure
anarchism, a minarchy, or even (shudder) simply a return to Constitutional
government.  But we can all agree on what direction we should move in, and
most of us will even agree on how we should judge success.

<p>
If we agree that our goal (in the political arena) is simply to maximize
personal freedom, that leaves considerable room for disagreement about what
methods would best achieve that goal.

<a href="2910.html#2920qlink2">&gt; My question is: what enables you</a><br>
<i>&gt; to lump together "intelligence, information, order, vitality, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; capacity for improvement"? What do these concepts have in common- i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; where does their "extropiness" lie?</i><br>

<p>
Here I think you have a valid point, if a bit overstated.  If we are going
to have any common purpose, we have to be able to say what that purpose is.
Otherwise we are simply a group of people who enjoy arguing with each other.

<p>
However, I think you are looking for the wrong kind of definition.  We
aren't going to be able to construct a perfect logical edifice defining for
all time what is and is not "extropian".  What we need is simply a unifying
principle that can be applied to judge specific cases as they arise.
