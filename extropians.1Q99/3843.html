<a name="3844qlink2">The United States has one of the best and most forward thinking</a> public education
<a name="3844qlink3">systems in the world and of all time.</a>  All citizens have access to education, in
<a name="3871qlink1"><a name="3855qlink1"><a name="3853qlink1"><a name="3844qlink4">fact it is mandated for school age children barring alternative home</a> or other
schooling.
</a>

<p>
</a><a name="3855qlink2"><a name="3853qlink2">I had the opportunity to work for the local school district in high school</a> as a
</a>
<a name="3853qlink3"><a name="3844qlink5">computer assistant for a couple hours after school, I worked</a> for the special
<a name="3853qlink4">services department that provides track based learning</a> to both developmentally
<a name="3853qlink5">disabled and accelerated students.  They are wonderful people.</a>

<p>
I am the product of a self-taught and public education, and attended a private
college.

<p>
Of course, individuals have different experiences with education, as well they
certainly should!
</a>

<p>
<a name="3855qlink3">The thing that I feel has helped me the most is the skill of reading</a> and having
<a name="3844qlink6">learned to read somewhat intuitively from the ages of 3 to 7 for basic reading
skills, and 8 to now for advanced reading skills.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3855qlink4"><a name="3853qlink6">I was subjected to a rigorous public education, and am the better</a> for it.
</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="3855qlink5"><a name="3853qlink7"><a name="3844qlink7">Learning is a lifelong process.  Learning isn't just about school, it's</a> also about
</a>
<a name="3844qlink8">socialization skills and the myriad other things that make life</a> a rich tapestry.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3855qlink6"><a name="3844qlink9">It is not good that not every student has the same opportunities,</a> that is, not all
<a name="3844qlink10">public schools are the same, but at the same time,  I feel almost any</a> person if
<a name="3844qlink11">raised and educated well could surpass, for example, me, whom I consider well
educated.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3853qlink8">The educational system serves everyone, and as it is said, not all</a> the people are
</a>
<a name="3853qlink9"><a name="3844qlink12">pleased all the time.  That said, free public education is the backbone</a> of
America.</a>
