Unfortunately, it also does the same thing in the other direction.
This Social Security "surplus" does not count all the promises the
government has made in the future.  If you buy a house, you're getting an
asset to more than balance the liability of the loan you took to buy it.
When you promise someone that you will take care of him financially when
he's old, you are taking on a liability.  The government's liabilities
amount to a huge amount, many times the budget or national debt.

(Of course, the government can back out of their commitments perhaps
more easily than a private party can.)
