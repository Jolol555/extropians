<a name="0910qlink1">In many of the non-profit projects that I get involved in, there
arise typical problems - coming, I guess, from some common features:</a>


<UL>
  <li>  difficulty to explain the project to many people, as it is
  usually highly technical, relatively obscure (can't show it
  to a large audience)

  <li>  lack of funds

  <li>  difficulty in managing a diverse group of people who may
  sympathize with the goals of the project, but are too busy
  to push it forward.

  <li>  probably a bunch of other common factors [?]


</UL>
<p>
<a name="0800qlink1">There are two basic approaches to this problem as I see it.


<OL>
  <li>  Whine and complain that normal people are too stupid to
   understand great ideas, and smart people are too depressed
   and/or selfish and/or unreliable to implement them.


</OL>
<p>
   This helps, to vent the frustration, for the first 30 seconds or so.

<p>
2. Realize that the world is imperfect (that's good, isn't it, what
</a>
<p>
   would we do in a perfect world?  Or in the world whose imperfections
   would be beyond our understanding?)  and do something about it.

<p>
I would like to suggest some ideas on this last one.

<p>
<a name="0910qlink2">The crucial thing I think is visibility, from the very beginning.
You want to find people who would help you do the work, criticize
your approach, donate money, test the results, etc.</a>

<p>
One way to do this is gaining high visibility on the Web.
A service that I have been happily using recently, is Clicktrade -
originally an idea of our fellow extropian, Scott Banister.
It allows you to _buy_ visitors for your website for as little as
1 penny.   An investment of $100 dollars, and a modest link (e.g.
"visionary socially responsible projects" will bring you 10,000
visitors that hopefully (and actually, in my experience with my
own site) will make this investment worthwhile.

<p>
<a name="0910qlink3">We can also create a Frontier Projects web page.
This page would list a number of good projects, describing for each
the goal, the approach, contact info, and call for participation.</a>

<p>
This could go beyond extropian projects.
Awhile ago, I stopped giving money to any "good causes", thinking
that it would be humiliating to decide that the best way I could
use my resources for social good is to pass these resources to
someone else.  So instead I can spend my resources on the projects
that I work on myself.  I am sure there are other people who feel
like this, and there are more people who would like to contribute
to a visionary project that can actually take the world forward than
toss their money down the seemingly bottomless pit of the traditional
attempts to alleviate problems of backward social structures.

<p>
So my first two suggestions are:


<UL>
  <li>  Create the [Great/Extropian/Frontier] Projects website
  <li>  collect some seed money for advertising this Projects site, and
  also other visionary sites - Extropian and TH pages, Global Bank
  of Ideas, etc.


</UL>
<p>
  Maybe, after applying visionary PR methods, we'll turn the most
visionary projects on the planet into the most popular ones?

<p>
I have more meta-project ideas, but first I think we should address
the above issues.

<p>
Or maybe you see other issues, and other solutions?

<p>
<a name="1474qlink1"><a name="1473qlink1"><a name="1004qlink1">Meanwhile, is there anybody with some HTML skills and/or a few extra
dollars and a will to use them to promote worthy causes?</a>
