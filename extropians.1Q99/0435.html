Irrelevant. What is relevant is whether an individual was told by another
individual that they did not like being tickled, but they tickled them anyways.
This is as much a violation of the second person's rights as refusing to tickle
the first person because you knew that NOT tickling them brought them pain....

<p>
Absolutes in morals do not usually contradict, they are just difficult for the
squeamish and weak to practice. Where there are consistent contradictions, then
there should be no moral for that situation.

<p>
Ah, so the child lives, never learning how to bake his own bread, just stealing
bread, and reproduces, and teaches his offspring how to steal bread, because it
is apparently a positive survival skill. Because it takes hours to bake bread
but only seconds to steal it, the theif has much more time to spend reproducing,
and eventually outpopulating the bread bakers and everyone starves to death....
so, which is the greater good, letting one child starve, or postponing it such
that millions starve?
