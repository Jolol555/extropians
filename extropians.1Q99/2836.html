Liebowitz's net papers are at <a href="http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/netpage.html">http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/netpage.html</a>
and the closest thing seems to be <a href="http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/jep.html">http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/jep.html</a>  
whose abstract is:

<p>
<i>&gt;This article in combination with our paper "Are Network Externalities a </i><br>
<i>&gt;New Source of Market Failure" has had important impacts in the network </i><br>
<i>&gt;externality literature. Katz and Shapiro, in response to our work, have </i><br>
<i>&gt;adopted our term "network effect" instead of the policy-pejorative term </i><br>
<i>&gt;"network externality".  Also, they accept our point that pecuniary </i><br>
<i>&gt;externalities, which are importantly different from technological </i><br>
<i>&gt;externalities, have been conflated in this literature, and need to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;treated differently. Although, Katz and Shapiro have changed some of </i><br>
<i>&gt;their positions to accommodate our criticisms, we would have been happier </i><br>
<i>&gt;if they had been willing to acknowledge their debt to our work.</i><br>

<p>
In the paper they say:

<p>
<i>&gt;Broadly defined, network effects are indeed pervasive. However, we reserve </i><br>
<i>&gt;the term "network externality" for a specific kind of network effect in </i><br>
<i>&gt;which the equilibrium exhibits unexploited gains from trade regarding </i><br>
<i>&gt;network participation. The advantage of this definition over other </i><br>
<i>&gt;possible definitions is that it corresponds with the common understanding </i><br>
<i>&gt;of externality as an instance of market failure.</i><br>

<p>
I actually strongly disagree with this attitute toward terminology.
In economic theory we build models from standard components and 
see what the combination of those components does in any given
situation.  We need a terminology for descibing components that 
makes no presumptions about the effect of some combination.

<p>
"Externality" describes a specific kind of assumption/feature 
one might put into a model.  The existance of market failure is a 
property of a whole specific model.  It is crucial that we can
agree on what a term like "externality" means about the assumptions
of a model, without that implying anything about whether that
model describes a market failure.

<p>
Substituting the word "effect" is far too weak.  If we did this
with every term we wouldn't be left with a vocabulary that let's
us distinguish anything interesting.  

<p>
To sum up, there is no common understanding that externalities
imply market failure.  If I saw externalities in a model, that 
might suggest to me, all else equal, that this model might 
be more likely to exibit market failure.  But is just a heuristic,
and has nothing to do with what the term "externality" means.
