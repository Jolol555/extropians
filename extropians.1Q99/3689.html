Assuming you couldn't ask anyone else their number, th best guess would be
your own number.

<p>
There is a set of twenty numbers to consider, one each of 0 through 9, and one
digit that is the 100 factorial'th digit of Pi, which is calculable, repeated
ten times.  Anyways, thus the 100!-th digit of Pi is represented in the set of
20 numbered denizens of the universe 11 times.  It is more than %50 likely,
%55 likely, that the number one receives is the number in question.  It is a
simple probability.  Reference Vegas.
