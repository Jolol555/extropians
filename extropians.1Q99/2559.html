<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Thought I would throw this question out.  Is it ethical to create</i><br>
<i>&gt; specially designed sentient beings which would be engineered to do specific</i><br>
<i>&gt; tasks?  Would it be ethical for their creators to profit from the labor of</i><br>
<i>&gt; their creations?  Esentially, we're talking about the possibility of a perfect</i><br>
<i>&gt; slave caste, willing and able to serve general purpose sentients (like us) in</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever capacity we design them to.  What do you all think?</i><br>

<p>
No intelligent self aware creature should be a slave to anyone. The only
relationship that a creator can have with his creations is that of the parent to
child, and only for a period of time sufficient for the creation to mature to a
mental/emotional/logical state of 'adulthood', at which time, the creation is a
fully free individual. Forced child labor is abhorrent. You could engineer
creatures who will be suited to and will find enjoyment in specific tasks, and
their knowledge that that is what their genetic predispostion is may help many of
them adjust to such a specified life more easily than current humans, but they
must ultimately be free to choose if that is the life they wish to lead, and only
for their own benefit, not for the benefit of others.

<p>
The only reason one individual should create another individual is because the
first finds joy in creating, educating, and raising to 'adulthood' a free
individual. Any motives based on concepts of ownership of other individuals are
against Natural Law.
