Abstract
<br>
  An oral glutamine load was administered to nine healthy
  subjects to determine the effect on plasma glutamine,
  bicarbonate, and circulating growth hormone concentrations. Two grams
  glutamine were dissolved in a cola drink and ingested over a
  20-min period 45 min after a light breakfast. Forearm venous blood samples
  were obtained at zero time and at 30-min intervals for 90 min and compared
  with time controls obtained 1 wk earlier. Eight of nine subjects responded to
  the oral glutamine load with an increase in plasma
  glutamine at 30 and 60 min before returning to the control
  value at 90 min. Ninety minutes after the glutamine
  administration load both plasma bicarbonate concentration and circulating
  plasma growth hormone concentration were elevated. These findings demonstrate
  that a surprisingly small oral glutamine load is capable of
  elevating alkaline reserves as well as plasma growth hormone.
