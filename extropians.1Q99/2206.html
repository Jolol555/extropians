<i>&gt;its</i><br>

<i>&gt;its going</i><br>

<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;medium changes its course, thus making its destination longer than if </i><br>
<i>&gt;there</i><br>
<i>&gt;wasnt a medium.   </i><br>

When light (electromagnetic energy) hits an electron, which is an
electrically  charged particle, the electron is made to vibrate.  A
vibrating electron in turn creates an electromagnetic field with the same
frequency as the vibration.  Metals are shiny because there is a cloud of
mobile electrons at the surface of the metal, free to vibrate easily, so
metals typically have high reflectivity.     
  Because electrons have mass, they have inertia, so their vibration is a
bit delayed (out of phase) relative to the phase of the wave fronts of
light which cause them to vibrate.  That, I think, is the cause of the
delay as light moves through a transparent material.  The wavelength of
visible light is typically about 1,000 times the size of a typical simple
molecule, like silicon dioxide (quartz), so the idea that the photons are
delayed because they 'bounce around' as they pass through a transparent
medium such as glass is seemingly not correct.  It's more like a
motorboat which runs slower through molasses than through water.
