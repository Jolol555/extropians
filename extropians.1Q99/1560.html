Active administratiors will run frequent cancelbots on spammers. Less
experienced or less involved administrators tend to let things run amok. Since
<a name="1570qlink2">bulk emailers tend to mail late at night or early in the morning, they usually
mail at least 10-16 hours before the typical casual admin logs on and cleans
house.</a> Admins who keep it up on their screens all day tend to run frequent
cancelbots.

<i>&gt; freaks who don't seem to have a clue as to the effects of your proposed</i><br>

<i>&gt; your supposed safety. We don't want that.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1570qlink3">That is a load of crap. There is a big difference between mandating that From
and Reply-To addresses are real addresses from which the mail actually
originated (even if the mailer is an anonymous one), and using fraudulent
header information, which is the typical spammer</a> tactic to avoid retribution.

<p>
<a href="1558.html#1560qlink3">&gt; You cannot stop spam with laws unless those laws are globally enforced</a><br>
<i>&gt; and all traces of Internet privacy is eliminated. That means no</i><br>

<i>&gt; Net. That is evil, and you and Mike and the other anti-spam freaks are</i><br>
<i>&gt; the worst threat to freedom on the Net today.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1570qlink4">More crap. Nobody is more pro-freedom than</a> I. I, however, am mature enough,

<p>
<a name="1570qlink6">If you've read my posts, I do not want government mandates if the market can
develop mechanisms to cause spammers to pay their way.</a>

<p>
If the market (you, me, and everyone) refuses to acknowledge that there is a
problem, or refuses to do something about it in a self regulatory manner, then
it is eventually gonna piss off enough powerful people that something is gonna
be done at a political level whether you like it or not.

<p>
<a name="1570qlink7">Government has always loved to use abuses in systems as excuses to regulate and
take over markets. This only occurs when the parties in the market refuse to do
something about a problem.</a>

<p>
<a name="1570qlink8">I want to keep the internet a tax free, free speech, free encryption, and
generally do as you please zone.</a> The only way it is going to stay that way is
if people start taking personal responsibility and taking action to prevent the
sort of abuses of the system which will invite the jack booted storm troopers
in the door.
