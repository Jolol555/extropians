Scott Badger &lt;wbadger@psyberlink.net&gt; replied about how to respond to
dieing fiends:


<p>
<a href="2669.html#2672qlink1">&gt; Persuade her to consider cryonic preservation.</a><br>


<p>
	If a religious person came to me when I was on my death bead
and tried to persuade me to do something like "repent and believe in
Jesus so that I might be saved" I'd be terribly offended and hurt by
such an act.

<p>
<a name="2698qlink2">	What are the odds that any average Joe or Jane, on their death
bed, would not be offended by an extropian preaching the possibility
of cryonic salvation?</a>

<p>
<a name="2698qlink3">	Pushing cryonics is of course the action I'd like to take when
faced with the death of a friend or family member.  But how will they
take it?  Just how much of this can we do for how many people?  When
death isn't close most people aren't to receptive to the idea of
cryonics.  Does this ever change when people are actually on it's
doorstep?
