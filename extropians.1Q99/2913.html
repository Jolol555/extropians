<a name="2944qlink2">There is some question about whether such planets exist (unless you are
including gas giants in your analysis, which is a completely different
<a name="2944qlink3">issue).</a>  But even granting that, there is no serious barrier to space travel
in the long term.

<p>
Certainly, a species on such a planet isn't going to get very far with the
kinds of rockets we have now.  However, there are two easy ways out of this
trap:


<OL>
  <li>  Even primitive nanotech will allow you to build rockets that can easily
reach orbit.  All you need is the ability to synthesize diamondoid materials
with a very high level of quality.  This improves the lift-to-weight ratio
</a>
so much that even a 3G liftoff through dense atmosphere would be feasible.

<a name="2944qlink4">  <li>  Nuclear power can also be used for rockets.  We don't build them because
too many people are afraid of the word "nuclear", but the technical barriers
are modest.  Again, 3Gs isn't enough to keep such vehicles from making
orbit.</a>


</OL>
<p>
<a name="2944qlink5">On a more fundamental level, let me point out that both of these are
short-term solutions.  Do we really think that any possible planetary
environment could keep a technological civilization stranded for a million
years?  How about ten million?  A hundred million?</a>

<p>
To explain the Great Silence we need more than a temporary impediment to
progress.  We need something that makes it absolutely, completely, utterly
impossible for a typical life-bearing world to produce a civilization like
what we expect ours to be in another 100 years.
