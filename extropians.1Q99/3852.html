<p>
One thing to recognize right away is that your basic thermodynamics was
originally an empirical study of the behavior of things like steam engines.
The statistical definitions, and the debates over how statistics should be
handled, came later, especially via mathematicians like Maxwell -- complete
with half-serious speculation that maybe you could reverse entropy after all,
with an intelligent device or "demon" to alter the statistics of fast vs slow
molecules in some way. In some sense, "basic thermo" texts are almost sure be
based on an empirical shortcut or a beginning model of what the subject is all
about. For more information, see Chapter 4 of _Nanosystems_, and also the
paradox that Drexler describes for defining the entropy of a "glassy crystal"
in the glossary entry for "entropy" at the back of the book. If someone like
Drexler can catch the usual treatment of a subject in an out and out paradox,
we can be sure that the most usual treatment is only an approximation, and not
the whole story.

<p>
In answer to your question about why isn't the Third Law violated after all, I
should point out that the true statistics of this would seem to be very much a
Bayesian (or Laplacian) kind of procedure where entropy is defined in terms of
probability, which in turn can depend very much on the state of knowledge of
the person doing the calculations. Now, it's my understanding that if Bayesian
theorists ever manage to be consistently wrong in their forecasts of certain
events, they don't necessarily throw out their previous probability
calculations, rather, they try to update their knowledge so that the
probability numbers are more predictive or better-informed in the future.
Apparently, really well-informed or complete calculations *never* get the
theorists into a situation where a fair-minded observer would insist that
entropy is sure to be reversed. Systems always tend to evolve so that the
observer knows fewer and fewer of the details and entropy is increased,
*unless* we open up the system so that an observer, or a "demon", or someone,
can *find out more* about the system -- *that* doesn't violate thermodynamics,
at all!

<p>
As for liquids evaporating to form gases, if almost any reasonably
well-informed observer is going to predict that, then maybe it's not too much
to ask for Nature to oblige the predictions practically all of the time. After
all, predicting *is* a major goal of probability theory, even if forecasts
never come with an iron clad guarantee.

<a href="3797.html#3852qlink2">&gt;Where the subjective component comes in, I think, is in terms of our</a><br>
<i>&gt;interpretation of what the system is doing.  We define what are liquids</i><br>
<i>&gt;and what are gasses . . . But the behavior of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;system is independent of our thoughts.</i><br>

<p>
See my above comment about Nature. Natural events have their own reality, but
there is no reason why this real behavior should be inconstent with
probability based logical reasoning by rational observers.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3797.html#3852qlink3">&gt;In the case of Kolmogorov complexity, the mathematics does not include</a><br>
<i>&gt;a subjective element in quite the same way, but it does leak in . . . there</i><br>

<i>&gt;and each will come up with a different value for the complexity.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;can show that, in some sense, they won't disagree too drastically over</i><br>
<i>&gt;the broad range of all possible strings, but there is still room for</i><br>
<i>&gt;considerable disagreement.</i><br>

<p>
Now we're getting somewhere, this is just the sort of impression that I got
about your reference to a complexity definition, to begin with.

<p>
<i>&gt; [David Blenkinsop wrote:]</i><br>
<a href="3797.html#3852qlink4">&gt;&gt; Maybe the best approach here is just to admit that there isn't any truly</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; objective separation between conscious matter and unconscious, at least</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; nothing of an objectively *scientific* nature.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In terms of the dilemma I raised, the question is whether there is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;objective fact of the matter whether a given system is conscious or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Can you imagine that it is truly possible that some other person is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not conscious?  Not just that they might not be conscious, but that it</i><br>
<i>&gt;is as legitimate to say that they aren't conscious as that they are,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and likewise that it is as legitimate to say that your kitchen sink is</i><br>
<i>&gt;conscious as that it is not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>


<p>
I'm not so concerned that someone might say that I'm no more conscious than a
kitchen sink, since, for one thing, this is a really old philosophical
chestnut, called "solipsism", famous for having no truly definitive, formal or
logical answer. Descartes said "I think, therefore I am", but you can never be
sure that the other guy is *really* thinking, you know, maybe everyone else
but oneself is non-conscious, that's the chestnut or dilemma of it, I believe.
Again, you have to look to the actual behaviour of what you find in Nature.
For instance, if animals behave as though they have a kind of
world-understanding, or sentience, why then, they probably do, and if other
humans seem to understand things on a much higher, or more symbol-oriented
level than animals, why then, they probably do. Any *scientific* separation
between conscious and unconscious has to be practical and based on observable
behaviors, unlike the implication of your statement about consciousness, that
you labelled "C", "It is an objective matter whether a given conscious entity
exists". Behaviors indicating consciousness may exist, without consciousness
being locally or objectively definable in any *absolute* sense. Again, entropy
is, in Drexler's words "not a local property", so perhaps scientific
definitions of consciousness can't be local either, even though we'd all
report that "it feels as though I'm locally right here".

<p>
One thing that sparks my interest here, is that it seems as though we've got
an argument for God, or for something comparable to God, as the Great Observer
on some mathematical level. If we prove our consciousness through behaviors,
and someone else has to *see* those behaviors for any special "consciousness
property" to become objectively real, then maybe all this making of "emergent
qualities" just has to unify on *some* level? Myself, I would tend to see this
as a bit like the quantum Many Worlds theory, in the sense that the ultimate
reality apparently stretches out beyond what science can measure directly. So
not only does it seem that there may be alternate worlds whose "consciousness
supporting" ability we'll never verify, there may be a unity and an
objectivity to it all that we'll never measure, as well?
