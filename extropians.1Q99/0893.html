<p>
By using the same technology, of course.  While your robots are journeying
to the Oort cloud and diverting comets, mine are mining the moon to build
defensive systems in high orbit.  A multi-gigaton warhead will convert a
comet into a cloud of gas quite nicely.  If you build missile defenses on
the comet, we can use directed energy weapons instead (burn one side</a> of the
comet to push it off course - or just shoot off your missile defenses and
nuke it).  I have far more mass to play with than you do, which lets me
build bigger and better hardware.

<p>
The fundamental point is that the contest between offense and defense is far
from over.  Nuclear weapons and ICBMs gave offense a temporary edge because
the size of the Earth and the speed of human reflexes used to be important
limitations.  The same automation that lets us actually do something with
assemblers will completely change that equation, and it is not easy to
predict how.
