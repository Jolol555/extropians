In a message dated 99-02-25 10:16:29 EST, you write:

<p>
 Useful for feeling good and evading hard answers perhaps but it is rather
 unusual that making a symbol have 8-billion definitions makes it useful for
 anything at all.
 
<p>
 Definitions are the sine qua none of understanding: they are the only proof
 that we have an understanding.

<p>
I agree with you here.
 
<p>
 It is for us when your spirituality convinces you
 that we are blasphemers. It is for you again if another religionist decides
 that your God is competing with hers.

<p>
Why be so defensive to religionists?  Atheists and other idealogues (such as
Hitler and Stalin) also do these bad things.

<p>
 Actually, the one person whom i respect most on this list (not
 saying who) is also the person whom i would predict would be the most kind
 and for whom I would, never having met them, do most anything. I recall also
 that the person on this list some years ago who struck me as most intensely
 critical was also the most objectively kind.

<p>
Why not say who it is?  Can't we let people know it when we admire them?  Is
this reticense an extropian meme?
  
<p>
 I guess that what I am saying is that critical capacity and affect are not
 only not opponents of one another (which no-one here has implied) but
 neither are they even particularly separable elements when analyzed at an
 introspective level (of course they are somewhat separable
 neuropsychologically, but then we are talking about dozens of computational
 modules processing such diverse things theory-of-mind, affective
 representations of others versus self and in fact a plethora of highly
 interesting, separable affective-cognitions).
  
<p>
Well said.

<p>
 My feeling from watching this list is that some of its members are among the
 most wonderful affective and intellectual company I have ever experienced
 and that the two feed elements each other quite wonderfully.
