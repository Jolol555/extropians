<a name="1742qlink1">  IAN: Scientific American (Jan 1999, p. 92) states
  that there are an estimated 32 to 40 billion embedded 
  chips, and, as you note, most are not date sensitive.
  However, we're not out of the woods just yet. It says:

<p>
"...most of the systems [ embedded-chip dependant ] do not 
depend on any knowledge of dates and will therefore not 
be affected by Y2K. Of those that area date-sensitive, 
only a very tiny fraction will suffer anomalous processing. 
Nevertheless, even that minute percentage is still cause 
for concern. Although nobody knows for sure the exact 
number, Gartner [ Group, in Stamford, Conn. ] estimates 
that millions of those embedded systems are vulnerable."

<p>
  The author of Scientific American's Y2k article (page 93) 
  concludes: "I believe that severe disruptions will occur 
  and that they will last perhaps about a month." Wow! A
  month or so without water, electricity, or telephone, 
  or all of the above, might even thin out the population.</a>
