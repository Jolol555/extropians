<p>
Maybe, some of this curriculum can be offered as paid
workshops before Extropian conferences?

<p>
Don't know if any other website is needed.
Why not ExI's? 

<p>
Would you envision the School/workshop giving college
credits that could be used towards social/future studies program?
What about the online course?

<p>
<a name="1127qlink1">I know many people coming to the extropian mailing lists and
gatherings, are frustrated because nobody debates the basics
there.  I learned to quickly explain why this is so, but the
need is still there (maybe, extropian list would have more
focused discussions now if its new members were coming through
this School).</a>

<p>
Existing Web guides, good as they are, also do not completely
address the problem of introducing basics to a new visitor.
But then, this probably could be worked into &gt;H websites...
