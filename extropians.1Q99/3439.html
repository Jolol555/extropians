<a name="3444qlink1">Personally I prefer the fourth option: if government inevitably grows into
a hideous monstrosity, then government is by nature bad and we should get
rid</a><a name="3444qlink2"> of it. And given the kind of power than the technologies we discuss on
this list would give to individuals, I have a hard time understanding why
anyone would even consider that government will be a possibility for much
longer. Even today, a small group of irate tax-payers could wipe out most
of DC for a few million dollars; in a couple of decades, an individual 
should be able to do it as a project for a boring winter's evening.
