<i>&gt; The Extropian Redneck:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Redneck Application of the 7 Principles of Extropianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. Perpetual Progress - "I want to kill more deer.  To do so, I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; become a smarter hunter - ever increasing my deer hunting skills.  If</i><br>
<a name="0736qlink4"><i>&gt; I live indefinitely, the number of deer I kill will increase.</a>  I will</i><br>
<a name="0736qlink5"><i>&gt; seek to remove all obstacles standing in the way of killing</a> more deer</i><br>
<a name="0736qlink6"><i>&gt; - be they political, cultural, biological or psychological."</i><br>

<p>
You automatically assume that I find utility in killing MORE</a> deer per unit of time. This is an unjustified and untrue
<a name="0736qlink7">assumption. I may seek to increase my deer hunting skills</a> by making it more difficult for me to kill a deer, say
<a name="0736qlink8">eventually I may only do so with bare hands, or that I must</a> kill from beyond 1000 yards, or be within 10 yards, etc.,
<a name="0736qlink9">which would obviously reduce my overall deer kill rate.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0736qlink10"><a href="0714.html#0729qlink3">&gt; 2. Self-Transformation - "I also want to drink more beer. I affirm</a><br>
<i>&gt; that I will direct my entire being to transform myself into a more</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficient beer-drinking person.  Through critical and creative</i><br>
<i>&gt; thinking I will become a better beer drinker.  I will explore</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological and neurological augmentations that will allow me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; consume ever-greater quantities of beer."</i><br>

<p>
You again assume that the unit of improvement is quantity.</a> I actually prefer microbrewed beer, for the taste. I tend to
<a name="0736qlink11">drink less these days than in my Coors and Miller funnel</a> chugging frat boy days in college....

<p>
<a name="0736qlink12">Try to imagine that you are talking about a Californian instead</a> of a redneck:
2. Self-Transformation - "I also want to drink more wine. I affirm
that I will direct my entire being to transform myself into a more
<a name="0736qlink13">efficient wine-drinking person.  Through critical and creative
thinking I will become a better wine drinker.  I will explore
biological and neurological augmentations that will allow me to
consume ever-greater quantities of wine."
This is obviously inaccurate, as the goal will</a> be to be a more discriminating and capable wine connesseur, the goal of
<a name="0736qlink14">which would be to drink BETTER wine, and have better taste in wine.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0736qlink15"><a href="0714.html#0729qlink4">&gt; 3. Practical Optimism - "Life is great.  I know I will continue to</a><br>
<i>&gt; have more and more opportunities to drink beer and kill deer."</i><br>

<p>
As far as the utility value of each permits...</a> yes

<p>
<a name="0736qlink16"><a href="0714.html#0729qlink5">&gt; 4. Intelligent Technology - "There must be some way</a> to applice science</a><br>
<a name="0736qlink17"><i>&gt; and technology to enable me to consume more beer and kill</a> ever greater</i><br>
<a name="0736qlink18"><i>&gt; numbers of deer.  Perhaps a new laser equipped, satellite enhanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; site for my rifle, neuro-implants to sharpen my vision, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; mouth-widening operation to allow me to drink two bottles of beer at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same time.  I refuse to see technology as an ends to itself, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; more as an enabler to allow me to further my redneck goals."</i><br>

<p>
excellent.... ;)

<p>
<a href="0714.html#0729qlink6">&gt; 5. Open Society - "I support social orders that promote freedom of</a><br>
<i>&gt; rifle ownership and deer hunting.  I oppose authoritarian social</i><br>
<i>&gt; controls which ban the drinking of beer, even on Sunday.  I prefer</i><br>
<i>&gt; bargaining over battling, exchange over compulsion, and serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; hunting over spotlighting."</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0714.html#0729qlink7">&gt; 6. Self-Direction - "The woods over over yonder, my rifle is right</a><br>
<i>&gt; here and the cooler's in the truck!  All set!"</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0714.html#0729qlink8">&gt; 7. Rational Thinking - "I know that without hunting,</a> the population of</a><br>
<a name="0736qlink19"><i>&gt; deer will skyrocket, and while large numbers of deer make</a> for a target</i><br>
<a name="0736qlink20"><i>&gt; rich environment, too many deer will cause starvation which may lead</i><br>
<i>&gt; to extinction of deer population in certain areas, perhaps including</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Skunky Bark Huntin' Camp.  The more accurate my rifle site</a> is, the</i><br>
<a name="0736qlink21"><i>&gt; better shot I will become, thus increasing my hit to miss ratio.</a>  Beer</i><br>
<a name="0736qlink22"><i>&gt; frees the mind from worrying about the wife, twelve kids, six dogs,</i><br>
<i>&gt; leaking roof, the Trans Am on blocks in front of the trailer, and my</i><br>
<i>&gt; current lack of employment.  Budweiser is indeed, the king</a> of beers."</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0736qlink23">This is all very funny. I love it. I think I'll post it up</a> at my hunting cabin (called the Steel Gate Camp).
