[Regarding follicle mites]
<br>
<a href="3895.html#3900qlink1">&gt; So some people (like me) take measures to reject the little buggers.</a><br>
<i>&gt; Others (like you) are indifferent and willing to co-habitate with them.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What does that tell you?</i><br>

<p>
Since I know of no method proven to "reject the little buggers", that
tells me that you are either better informed or more gullible than I.
I hope it's the former: what method do you refer to?  I am, alas, one
of those for whom Minoxodil is ineffective (though it did give me a
slightly fuzzy crown, it wasn't cosmetically useful hair, and
certainly not worth $50 a month).

<p>
I am willing to suffer the beasts if the alternative is as drastic
and expensive as surgery, but if there's something more reasonable
that has valid clinical evidence of effectiveness, I'd use it.

function and cranial hair?  It certainly seems to be a prevalent
stereotype that smart guys are bald, though Newton and Einstein
are obvious counterexamples.</a>
