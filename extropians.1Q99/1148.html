It doesn't look like this would eliminate the effect.  Even if you widen the
distribution to factor out this effect, the high end of the performance
curve still seems to be sloping upwards.  At any rate, a few more years of
data should be enough to get a definitive answer - if the growth is
super-exponential, it should become unmistakable once the graph is extended
to 2000 or so.
