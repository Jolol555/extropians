What do you mean by social systems? I find that many of the great science
fiction writers do so as a matter of course. Heinlein developed several, and
Bujold's novels in her Vorkosigan universe shows several  as well. Damien's The
White Abacus also is an excellent example. The limitation I think that you may
be thinking of isn't a matter of what writers are capable of, but what humanity
is capable of dealing with realistically and still remain human. The more odd a
social system is, the more fitting it is with an alien species...
