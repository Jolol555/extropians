Farrell is an advisor of mine here, and I respect his opinion, so on that 
ground I should defer.  On the grounds of the argument you've described,
however, I retain my previous objection.  I think those 20s economists
were playing word games that ultimately lead to more confusion than it 
avoided.  It seems to me natural to say that a "pecuniary externality" is 
in fact an externality.  Those who assume that any externality must be 
non-pecuniary, or that any pecuniary externality is harmless, are assuming
too much.
