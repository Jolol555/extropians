Yes, but the difference here is possible widespread power outages or even a
total power outage.  Since this could lead to a lot of mayhem, it may make
it very difficult for the skilled people to coordinate long enough to get
the whole thing up and running again.  So if a power outage does last more
<pre>
than 4-6 weeks, most of us could be in serious trouble.  We shouldn't forget
that last year, Auckland, New Zealand's power grid was down for six weeks!
Lucky for them, the rest of their country and the world was doing fine,</a> so
</pre>
they were able to coordinate safely in order to get it back up again - and
it still took them six weeks to do it!  That scenario has made me really
wonder about all this.

<a name="1736qlink2"><a href="1708.html#1719qlink2">&gt; I also doubt that they will do this as part of y2k panics. They may do</a><br>

<p>
I hope your right about this.  But why is it that the ex-military boys I
know are the ones saying the military *will* do this?  Perhaps the
ex-military people I know are skewed from the norm in their assessment</a> of
this?

<p>
Are you saying they won't or they can't?  And for their purposes, why not?
Can't they just manufacture their own artificial panic by detonating one of
their nukes in the US?  But of course, now I am getting off topic!  :-)
