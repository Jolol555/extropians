Actually, the christian calendar was adopted as the standard calendar for
scheduling air travel worldwide after WWII (just as English is the standard
language for air traffic controllers and pilots, and almost all daily clocks are
more or less oriented on Greenwich mean time). Prior to that, it had gained
quite a bit of dominance thanks to the wonderfully benevolent help :) of empires
like the British Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Russian Empire, and, to a
lesser extent, the German, French, Dutch, and Italian empires.

<p>
While it may be fashionable to blame the US for all of this cultural
imperialism, most of it was already underway for a long time with the British
and others. We just picked up the pieces and moved on when the last, Brittania,
busted....
