<i>&gt;&gt;The price of gasoline these days is ridiculous!! So, if you want to make a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;statement, pass this on to everyone you know!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Check this out:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; At $1.75/gallon, I'm in! Let's see how far the internet email storms get</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; us!  Wouldn't it be cool to see this on the news?  Yeah, especially if it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; really did make the gas prices go down.....it's worth a try!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; GAS OUT</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; THE GREAT "GAS OUT"</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; It's time we did something about the price of gasoline in America!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; We are all sick and tired of high prices when there are literally</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; *millions* of gallons in storage.  Know what I found out?  If there</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; was just ONE day when no one purchased any gasoline, prices would drop</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; drastically.  The so-called oil cartel has decided to slow production</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; by some 2 million barrels per day to drive up the price.  I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; decided to see how many Americans we can get to NOT BUY ANY GASOLINE</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; on one particular day!  Let's have a GAS OUT! Advance notice is very</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; important! So ...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Do not buy any gasoline on APRIL 30, 1999!!!!!  Buy on the Thursday</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; before, or Saturday after.  Do not buy any gasoline on FRIDAY, APRIL</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; 30, 1999.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; Wanna help? Send this message to everyone you know!! Ask them to do</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; the same. All we need is a few million to participate in order to make</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; a difference.  And I believe we CAN make a difference. It's worth a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; try!</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks.<br>
