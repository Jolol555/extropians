Actually, our military code of justice would *require* them to refuse to
obey such an order.  You could plausibly face a court martial for complying
with it.  The idea is that a soldier takes his oath to the Constitution, and
this oath takes precedence over the orders of his superior officers.</a>

<a name="1715qlink1">The only way you can get a scheme like this through the system is to have
such a desperate situation (mass chaos, the imminent collapse of
civilization) that the officers conducting the trial believe the measures
are necessary for their own survival.  Then they might turn a blind eye -
but how could such a crisis possibly occur?  You need something much worse
than a few power outages to get that kind of panic.</a>
