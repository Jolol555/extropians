 Thanks Natasha for having the courage to bring up a topic that usually
generates
<br>
 an allergic reaction for so many in this community.  I think such reactions
are
<br>
 either due to lack of experience in these areas or mistaking the map for the
 territory.
 
 
<p>
 In regards to a theology of gods or Gods, they are not entirely without use.
If
<br>
 I find that a belief in a particular God or set of gods is useful to my
overall
<br>
 development, how is this a bad thing?  Internally believing in anything "as
if
<br>
 true" has its uses, no matter how absurd the belief.  The question becomes,
is
<br>
 this belief helping me to increase my own personal extropy or hinder it?  In
the
<br>
 past I found that oscillating between fervent belief and disbelief was a
useful
<br>
 exercise in finding the limits of belief and their effects on my own brain.
For
<br>
 those who haven't done this, I highly recommend this metabelief exercise -
 especially those who have remained within one or two highly confined belief
 systems - athiest/theist or otherwise.
 
<p>
 I completely agree that the 'New Age' renaissance was fabulous during its
 beginnings.  It had its roots primarily in Eastern historical methods of
 self-development and self-discovery where all things are possible and human
 potential can be developed without end.
 
 
<p>
 Yes again.  My current mix of things is a cross between practical psychology
and
<br>
 applied theology - I plan on being a god myself one day.
  
<p>
 Yes. As our love, compassion, and achieving bliss in oneself and stimulating
it
<br>
 in others.
  
<p>
 As do I.  Who said the path to godhood meant becoming stupid morons? :-)
  
<p>
 The strong tendency within this community to criticize first and seek out
 kindredness later has always bothered me.  On the other hand, it's a
refreshing
<br>
 change from the blind faith and stupidity rampant almost everywhere else we
 turn.  Perhaps it's that fact, that drives the current dichotomizing tendency
to
<br>
 be so critical when we could all be such good friends under other
circumstances.
 
<p>
 Yes, I have tried on numerous occasions, both directly and obliquely, to
point
<br>
 out that "synergy" as you call it.  I've always liked Anders ability to play
all
<br>
 sides of the transhumanist fence.  He can be the most ruthlessly logical
person
<br>
 at times, yet I've seen him say the most poetic and amazing things that pin
all
<br>
 these "softer" issues right on the head.
  
<p>
 I couldn't have summed up my own sentiments about the last 6 months of my
life
<br>
 better than that. :-)

<p>
Hurray for Paul and Natasha!!

<p>
Intellectual accomplishment need not dehumanize us.  Keep it up, guys.

<p>
 I plan on being a god myself one day. also.
