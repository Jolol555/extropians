<p>
Decreased emphasis on examinations is (in most cases) enough to make for an
entirely different environment. The emphasis is on flexibility. Course
length is not defined. Course structure is not defined. Course content is
not defined. In many ways the difference will depend on what sort of
education you have or are receiving - in my experience 'flexible' is
definitely not a term I would associate with any level of education</a> or
academia.

<p>
None of the above. And that's entirely the point. Any age, any level of
knowledge, self taught or formal education. Although to some degree you can
do anything at any age with any background in the current system it's far
from encouraged.

Founded on the principle that all men were not created equal.
