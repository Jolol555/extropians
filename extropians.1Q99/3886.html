Aside from being a rather unpleasant, this debate doesn't really seem
relevant to the question.  The limiting factor for a Mars colony is not
going to be the number of people required to get a viable gene pool and
raise the next generation.<a name="3915qlink9">  The real question is how big does the colony
have to be to be able to maintain itself long enough to grow into a new
civilization.

No one person could possible know enough to even maintain the equipment of a
Mars base.  She certainly isn't going to get a new civilization going on her

own.
