<a name="3030qlink1">Recently, there has been massive popular agitation for a memetic core
statement of our philosophy.  Some of us disagree with parts of the
Extropian Principles, others think they are too vague,</a> and still others
<a name="3030qlink2">think they are too complex and philosophical to serve as a combination
rallying point and recruiting brochure.

<p>
<a name="3020qlink1"><a name="3019qlink1"><a name="3001qlink1"><a name="2997qlink1">I offer, for your consideration and eventual virulent rejection, "The
Extropian Banner", after the style of "The Book of the SubGenius". 
After reading this, you'll be GLAD to take the Principles.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3018qlink1">WE are the EXTROPIANS.

</a><p>
WE are the advocates of ULTRATECHNOLOGY.

<p>
WE are READY and EAGER for the coming age of neurohacking,
nanotechnology, immortality, space colonization, Artificial
Intelligence, transhumanity, uploading, superintelligence, and the Singularity.

<p>
WE believe in intelligence, science, rational thought, freedom, and the FUTURE.

<p>
<a name="3075qlink3">WE do NOT believe in ignorance, pain, stupidity, death,</a> or income tax,
and we intend to DO something about it.

<p>
WE will MESS with our genes, WIRE our brains, PROGRAM self-modifying
Artificial Intelligences, UPLOAD ourselves into computers, become
TRANSHUMANS, and then use our enormous brains to enhance ourselves EVEN MORE.

<p>
WE will move ALL of Earth's heavy industry into space, end pollution,
and disassemble toxic waste with infinitesimal robots.

<p>
We will CRUSH the rainforests ANYWAY, just to GET BACK at the
environmentalists for trying to outlaw every form of technology more
advanced than AGRICULTURE.

<p>
WE believe that YOU should have the right to build yourself a spaceship
using nanotechnology, travel across the galaxy, stake out your own solar
system, DISASSEMBLE it, and use the mass to build a supercomputer TEN
BILLION TIMES SMARTER THAN THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE, all WITHOUT GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE.

<p>
WE see NO REASON to slow down the Inexorable March of Technological
Progress simply because someone ELSE thinks we are getting uncomfortably
close to GODHOOD.

<p>
WE would rewrite the LAWS OF PHYSICS if we could find the source code.

<p>
WE will LAUGH at limits.

<p>
WE will LAUGH at the foolish protests of namby-pamby technophobes.

<p>
<a name="3075qlink4"><a name="3054qlink1"><a name="3018qlink2"><a name="2997qlink2">WE will drag this planet, KICKING and SCREAMING, into the AWESOME</a> AND
UNKNOWABLE FUTURE, and do it BEFORE our parents die of old age.</a>

</a><p>
<a name="3054qlink2">YOU can help us.</a>

</a><p>

<p>
Does everyone agree with that?

<p>
ASIDE from the part about the rainforests.
That was a JOKE, ha ha.
