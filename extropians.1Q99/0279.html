  IAN: I think Einstein's thinking on economics measures
  the degree to which the masses have been "entrained" to 
  think emotionally when it comes to economics, so people 
  think more about ideal outcomes (how it should be) than 
  the scientific inquiry of WHY is it the way it is, of 
  what causes social wealth -- Adam Smith's inquiry.

<p>
  If people stop long enough to notice that places like 
  Hong Kong defined wealth expansion across the boards,
  they would see that to get the outcomes most of us
  want (overall wealth), all we need is a Taoiststyle
   government that pretty much does nothing.

<a name="0385qlink1">  Look at this statement by Einstein: "Production [in a
  capitalist society] is carried on for profit, not for 
  use." Huh?! Let's just do a little thinking: How can 
  a product in a free market be profitable if consumers
  don't think it's somehow useful to them? Uh... oh ya. 
  Not that I don't admire Einstein, but, like, geez!</a>
