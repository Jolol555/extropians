<a href="1643.html#1649qlink1">&gt;The anti-gun crusade's success is a natural result of the fact</a><br>
<i>&gt;that its supporters have more votes than the NRA.  Academic</i><br>
</a><i>&gt;liberals and journalists tend to be afraid of guns, afraid of</i><br>
<i>&gt;trusting individuals with anything, and in favor of government</i><br>
<i>&gt;control over everything.  Government agencies are always in favor</i><br>
<i>&gt;of obtaining a complete monopoly on force, and politicians think</i><br>
<i>&gt;they can get votes by promising to 'do something' every time</i><br>
<i>&gt;someone goes postal with an automatic weapon.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1652qlink1">They don't have more votes, that's why the Senate and Congress are
currently Republician. Over 35% of those who voted in that election
said they identified with the NRA. That total would be much higher
if the fight was over a total ban.</a> Besides, thanks to the antihandgunners
 we now have the militia's. (sarcasm) Think I'm kidding
folks? The whole militia movement took off after the anti-gun folks
tried to claim the second amendment only applied to "militia's".

<p>
The NRA's whole problem is that they don't make themselves clear to
non-members. The NRA is about FREEDOM. I remember when I used to
vote for so called "Pro-choice" candidates, then I found out they
were pro-choice on only one issue. I was supposed to support their
rights while they took mine away...... No more, I vote based on how
a candidate feels about the 2nd Amendment. let the "Pro-choicers"
fight for their own rights, it'll keep them from taking away mine.

<p>
I quit the NRA/ILA a few years ago when they refused to see what
was comming, and how we could have prevented it by timely action on
our part. There were a number of influential members who wanted me
to run for president back then.


<p>
<a href="1643.html#1649qlink2">&gt;In the long run, however, the only way to stop the steady erosion</a><br>
<i>&gt;of our right to bear arms is to convince the general population</i><br>
<i>&gt;that they should support us.  We can only hope that the effects of</i><br>
<i>&gt;decades of government propaganda can be reversed before it is too</i><br>
<i>&gt;late.</i><br>


<p>
You are right here, we need to point out the inconsistencies, guns
are legal in New York, murder is low, guns are illegal in Chicago,
murder capitol of the U.S.
