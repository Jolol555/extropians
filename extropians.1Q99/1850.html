Scott Badger has written,
<br>
<a href="1845.html#1850qlink1">&gt;I fail to comprehend how you (or Crick) equate</a><br>
<i>&gt;unconscious computations with Free Will.  Wanting</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do something (anything) may require a healthy</i><br>
<i>&gt;"anterior cingulate sulcus," but Crick seems to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggesting that this area is an enigmatic black box</i><br>
<i>&gt;which serves to covertly puppeteer our behaviors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;That doesn't sound like any kind of Free Will I've</i><br>
<i>&gt;heard of.</i><br>

<p>
As Francis Crick has pointed out, and as I previously posted:

<p>
"My first assumption was that part of one's brain is concerned with making
plans for future actions, without necessarily carrying them out. I also
assumed that one can be conscious of such plans -- that is, that they are
subject at least to immediate recall."

<p>
The part of the brain "concerned with making plans," as Crick clearly
stated, "is located in or near the anterior cingulate sulcus."

<p>
I read no suggestion into Crick's article of any "black box" doing any
"covert puppeteering" and I fail to see your point. I get the feeling you
object to Crick's discovery out of anti-scientific bias. Not very extropian,
that.

<p>
<a href="1845.html#1850qlink2">&gt;The great experiment we are a part of addresses the question,</a><br>
<i>&gt;"Can deluded entities without free will discover and/or transcend</i><br>
<i>&gt;their true nature?"</i><br>

<p>
To what "great experiment" do you allude? I'd answer your last question with
a definite "no" not that it makes any difference to any rational discussion
of Free Will. As far as it concerns me, extropy (which, in this context
means self-organizing life) coincides perfectly with my "true nature."

PS: Please, I beg you, don't bring any of your "deluded entitites" into this
thread.
