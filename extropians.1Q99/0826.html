"Much Ado About Nanotubes"
<br>
Collective peices of the article as posted by Gina "Nanogirl" Miller

<p>
The concept of a "space elevator"-a cable that would tether a 
geostationary satellite to earth and allow payloads to be raised to 
space without the use of rockets, was polarized two decades ago in two 
science-fiction novels written independently by Arthur C. Clarke and 
Charles Sheffield. In "The Fountains of Paradise," for example, Clarke 
envisioned the cable as a diamond-like fiber strong enough to support 
its more than 22,000-mile length.

<p>
In the past decade, a potential canidate material for this cable has 
emerged: carbon nanotubes. Indeed, at the Materials Research Society
(MRS) meeting in Boston early last month, chemist Daniel T. Colbert of 
Rice University, Houston, stated that nanotubes look like they may be 
stong enough to serve as an elevator in space. Colbert, who does 
research in the department of chemistry and the Center for Nanoscale 
Science &amp; Technology, prefaced this remark by noting that a rope, or 
parallel bundle, of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT's) should be 
the strongest fiber ever made-perhaps the strongest that can ever be 
made.

<p>
+++++++++

<p>
At a special evening plenary sessions that attracted a overflow 
audience, Smalley marveled at the physical properties of single-walled 
"buckytubes", which are being intensively studied around the world. In 
addition to being the strongest known fibers, he noted, SWNT's also 
promise to rival copper in electrical conductivity and diamond in 
thermal conductivity. 

<p>
Smalley, who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Robert F. 
Curl. Jr. and Harold W. Kroto for the discovery and characterization of 
buckministerfullerene (C 60), focused his talk, appropriately enough, on 
the big picture, discussing how buckytubes may help meet the challenges 
of the next century. At the outset, he urged his listeners, in seemingly 
contradictory fashion, to "think nano, think big." He was referring to 
the dream of constructing microscope objects with nanoscopic precision. 
Revolutionary new nanotechnology involving carbon based materials and 
devices will be crucial to meet the challenge of a burgeoning 
population, he said. This new technology will be necessary to make the 
lives of more than 6 billion people on Earth healthy and fulfilling.

<p>
+++++(There's a lot more interesting information in the article between 
here and the end, - to much for me to type- but it ends as:)
+++++

<p>
One strategy that Smalley and his co-workers are pursuing in their goal 
of economically producing bulk quantities of nanotubes is to his small, 
cut tubes as "seeds" from which to catalytically grow longer tubes. By 
selecting seeds with a specific diameter and helicity, for example, one 
presumably could grow nanotubes with the same structural features, and 
therefore the same properties. Another advantage of this approach, he 
said, is that the seeds could be oriented to produce aligned nanotube 
arrays. This might allow the tubes to be grown continuously to produce a 
1-cm-wide "buckycable."

<p>
Smalley and coworkers so far have made limited progress in developing 
this seed approach. But if they can solve the problems he believes it 
could become the basis of industrial process for making molecularly 
perfect SWNTs in multiton quanities. Nanotubes would then be cost 
efficient enough for use in large-scale applications, he predicted. 
Perhaps, one day, even for an elevator into space.

<i>&gt;The "Sugar Cube" That Remembers...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Last issue we talked about how nanotechnology may, eventually,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   enable us to store "...a hundred billion billion bytes in a volume</i><br>
<i>&gt;   the size of a sugar cube"</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (<a href="http://www.digital.com/rcfoc/981221.htm#A_Hundred_Billion_Billion">http://www.digital.com/rcfoc/981221.htm#A_Hundred_Billion_Billion</a>).</i><br>
<i>&gt;   But of course that's off in the far future. So how about a mere "100</i><br>
<i>&gt;   trillion bits of data in a cubic centimeter of space?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Brought to our attention by RCFoC reader Alan Maltzman from the Dec.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   15 Nikkei English News, it seems that Japan Science and Technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Corp. and Kyoto University's Hirao Active Glass Project is pursuing</i><br>
<i>&gt;   an optical storage device that will use femtosecond lasers (pulsing</i><br>
<i>&gt;   a thousand-trillion times each second) to store a hundred terabits</i><br>
<i>&gt;   of data in that tiny volume.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   They begin with today's optical storage technique of using a laser</i><br>
<i>&gt;   to burn pits in a surface. But they combine this with the laser's</i><br>
<i>&gt;   ability to alter the state of a rare earth element called</i><br>
<i>&gt;   "samarium," mixed into this glass storage medium, in a special way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Rather than burning a simple "on or off" pit, the samarium can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;   altered to only "burn out" certain "colors" from each spot, thereby</i><br>
<i>&gt;   allowing each spot to take on one of many different values (rather</i><br>
<i>&gt;   than only a 1 or 0).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   This is only "basic research" at this time. But it is a good</i><br>
<i>&gt;   reminder that it may not take the seemingly far-out technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;   breakthroughs of nanotechnology to make potentially vast differences</i><br>
<i>&gt;   in how we compute -- shorter-term innovation might allow us to store</i><br>
<i>&gt;   a year of Digital TV content in a glass sugar cube. Just don't drop</i><br>
<i>&gt;   it in your cup of coffee...</i><br>
