I had written:
<br>
<a href="1003.html#1014qlink1">&gt;"Collective entity" seems to involve a contradiction, since a collection</a><br>
of
<br>
<a href="1003.html#1014qlink2">&gt;objects can't itself be a physical object, it exists solely as a concept.</a><br>

<p>
Ian replies:
<br>
<a name="1021qlink1">  IAN: A stone is an object, and as I understand,
  it's composed of "a collection of objects" known
  as molecules, atoms, and subatomic entities; which
  directly falsifies your claim that "a collection
  of objects can't itself be a physical object."

<p>
Perhaps I should've written "mere collection of objects". A stone is
emphatically *not* just a "collection" (a mental grouping or association)
but a coherent whole that responds to changes as a unit. You can kick it,
you can stub your toe on it. You can't kick a mere collection of things,
such as "all the rocks in the universe".</a>

<p>
I had written:
<br>
<i>&gt;Apparently you wish</i><br>
<a href="1003.html#1014qlink3">&gt;to include concepts such as sets, relations and systems under the</a><br>
<i>&gt;definition of "entity". But this usage generates confusion, since there</i><br>
are
<br>
<a href="1003.html#1014qlink4">&gt;obvious basic differences between physical things on the one hand and</a><br>
<i>&gt;arrangements of things on the other, and grave errors ensue from failing</i><br>
to
<br>
<a href="1003.html#1014qlink5">&gt;distinguish different categories.</a><br>

<p>
Ian responds:
<br>
  IAN: Your error of saying physical objects
  (which are collections of entities) cannot
  exist seems the gravest and only error here.

<p>
But of course I said nothing of the sort. See above.

<p>
Again me:
<br>
<a href="1003.html#1014qlink6">&gt;Smith's famous invisible hand - virtually synonymous with the extropian</a><br>
<i>&gt;principle of spontaneous organisation - is the internal organizing</i><br>
<i>&gt;principle of a complex relational nexus.</i><br>

<p>
And he:
<br>
<a name="1021qlink2">  IAN: And the "complex relational nexus"
  is the "collective entity." I think that
  the case to the contrary is just semantics.

<p>
I'll agree to disagree. "Just semantics" discounts the importance of
careful language usage IMO, but have it your way.
