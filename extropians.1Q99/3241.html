<a name="3313qlink1">I suspect issues in economics are more controversial (even needlessly so)
because of the political baggage that many attach to them.</a>  The efficacy of
capitalism or socialism isn't undermined by the existence of eleven
dimensions.

Additionally, I've noticed a general attitude towards economists (even the
transfer pricing ones I deal with) by non-economists that they don't really
know anything.  I've not checked the latest accuracy figures for economists
predictions but the general feeling I get is that it is not spectacular.
People generally have a skepticism of economists.  But is this justified?
I'm not sure.  I don't think so.  I suspect the complexity of the phenomena
economics attempts to describe and model is higher than that of, say,
physics.  I'm not saying physics is not a complex subject.  But using
<a name="3247qlink1">Chaitin's definition of complexity, I suspect the "theory of everything" for
economics will be more complex (i.e., longer) than the "theory of
everything" for physics.  I believe it will have more variables, more
echelons, more overall complexity.  Perhaps the success rate of economic
predictions is similar to that of meteorologists for a reason, both subjects
attempt to model an extremely complex interplay between a host of agents.</a>
