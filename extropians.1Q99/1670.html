<a name="1675qlink1">I am a bit worried that this might turn into a speculative bubble,</a> for sure. I
<a name="1675qlink2">don't see it as one yet. Compared to the bubble in Japan a decade ago, we are
still  at a small fraction of the level of speculation seen there.</a>

<p>
Keep in mind that even by the most rosy estimates, there was only $30 billion
in business done over the web last year. What is that? 0.3% of the entire
economy? I'd be worried if we had this level of speculation with more than
5-10% of the economy on line, but not at this point... All of the internet
stocks that are part of this 'bubble' are still less than $500-700 billion in
total capitalization, I would guess off hand. Certainly less than one or two
trillion. The entire capital market is what? $40-60 trillion now?

<p>
People think Bill Gates is so rich, but if you go as a percentage of the total
economy, he still pales compared to the old robber barons.

<a name="1675qlink3">I do wonder as to how much the Fed is trying to sustain the economy, like the
did in the late 80s with steadily decreasing reserve percentages, etc.</a> but the
<a name="1675qlink4">economic numbers keep coming out ahead of what the experts thought, both in
the areas of employment, productivity, pay, etc. I'm starting to think that
the capitalist economy is finally coming out of the feedback loop its been in
for so long, mostly cause its got so damn many pistons</a> in it that it acts like
<a name="1675qlink5">a turbine now....

Say what you want about the overseas money crisis. That wasn't capitalism,
that was pure looting and fraud.
