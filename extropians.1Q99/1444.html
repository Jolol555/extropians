The problem is that there is less demand for such a thing than you might
imagine.  The Nokia 9000i is essentially what you've described, yet in
Nokia's After Market Services, we get only about one a day in for repair
or other work.  Of course, this could be taken as a sign that they are
extremely reliable in comparison to other cell phones, but I don't know
whether that is true.
