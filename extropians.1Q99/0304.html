<p>
Thats not necessarily the test. A survivalist, by definition, is trained to
SURVIVE, not to PROGRESS. Anyone's first concern in a crisis situation like
that is obviously "how am I going to make it through the day", then how am</a> I
going to make it though this month or year". Once these survival concerns are
addressed and fulfilled, the question then becomes "how am I going to acheive
as close to a 20th century lifestyle as I can?" which is where the engineering
comes in and survivalism is far less usefull.

<p>
<a name="0392qlink2">Combine survivialist training with engineering knowledge, and that person could
go extremely far back in time and have a decent 18th century community going
within 10-15 years.</a> Teach some primitives written language, the scientific
<a name="0392qlink3">method, some ethics/philosophy, and record as much as you can of what
technologies are possible and how to acheive them, and you'd have a 20th
century civilization going within a few</a> generations

I've been looking for a CD-ROM set of that. Does anyone know if it's digitized
yet and where to get it?
