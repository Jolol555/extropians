In general, no.  However, their treatment of military issues does tend to
give that impression.

<a name="0885qlink1"><a name="0875qlink1">IMO, the picture isn't that simple.  Early nanotech won't be able to burrow
that well - remember, there is nothing preventing us from using 100 MT
warheads instead of the puny &lt;200 KT devices currently in fashion.  Later
nanotech could do it, but by then you're facing multi-gigaton weapons.
Mature nanotech could protect you from anything reasonable, but by then I
would expect all threats to be pretty unreasonable.  For a good level of
security, you really need a good anti-missile system and enough room to use
it.

BTW - H should be on the 'nuke-building material' side of the ledger, not
the 'stuff to build walls with' side.
