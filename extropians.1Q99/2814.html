The generally accepted estimate for the number of guns in America</a> is over 200,000,000, and growing rapidly as more and more anti-gun laws are

British media about people just ignoring muggings in progress and walking
by rather than helping the victim. The same media folks who pushed for 
disarming the population are now complaining that disarmed people refuse to 
get hurt helping out their fellows. Like, duh.
