<i>&gt; &gt; CNN just published a report "Higher speed limits mean more deaths"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  ( <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/14/speeding.deaths.ap/">http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/14/speeding.deaths.ap/</a>  )</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from the studies conducted by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and insurance companies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The studies conclude that in the states that raised speed limits, highway</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; death rates increased by 12 to 15%.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But I would like to suggest a different statistic.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Let's assume that the death rate rises linearly with speed limit</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (looks like the case now).  So 10% increase in speed limit would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; raise death rates by 0.16 per 100 million miles traveled.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; So on average, a person would lose half of their life's worth of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; waking time per each incident = 35 years * 365 days * 16 hours * 0.16</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; = roughly, 33,000 hours  per 100 million miles traveled.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But then, the same speed increase would save people time for productive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and pleasant activities, with the savings:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 100 million miles / (average) 50 miles per hour * 10% = 200,000 waking</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; life hours.  Which is six times as much.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; An argument I've advocated (and put into practice) for the last half-million+accident-free</i><br>
<i>&gt; miles. I don't go quite as fast as I would like to though, as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; portion of my attention has to be diverted to scanning for cops. In selecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; a speed for the given conditions, I also trade off the expense of speeding</i><br>
<i>&gt; tickets against time saved. I've developed a 'courteous speeder' style of</i><br>
<i>&gt; driving, e.g. never passing at more than ~ 5mph.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can also argue reducio ad absurdum- lowering the limit to zero will</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'save' all the lives. I have never seen anyone do an analysis of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; phenomenon like the one above; why do you suppose that is? Might it</i><br>
<i>&gt; conflict with the kindergarten culture belief sysem?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Note that these hours are current, unlike the hours that will not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be lived in the future, and any reasonable person would consider</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; younger-age time now more valuable than old-age time later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; As driving is a stressful activity, time saved from it will likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reduce mortality from other reasons.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe. Sometimes I tell people I'm trying toget there quickly before I have an accident.</i><br>
<i>&gt; :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Add to this the unaccounted factors mentioned in the beginning of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; message, and also considerations that reliance upon police instead of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; common sense is not good for personal development, that it takes more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; human life time to pay police expenses for enforcing speed limits,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that people who save time are usually more careful and more productive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; than people who speed unreasonably (and don't have to suffer for their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; stupidity) - and you will see that *higher speed limits save lives*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think this is absolutly correct, but calls for a more formal study. I've alsodiscovered</i><br>
<i>&gt; that traffic court judges are completely oblivious to this</i><br>

An argument I've advocated (and put into practice) for the last half-million+accident-free
miles. I don't go quite as fast as I would like to though, as a
portion of my attention has to be diverted to scanning for cops. In selecting
a speed for the given conditions, I also trade off the expense of speeding
tickets against time saved. I've developed a 'courteous speeder' style of
driving, e.g. never passing at more than ~ 5mph.
You can also argue reducio ad absurdum- lowering the limit to zero will
'save' all the lives. I have never seen anyone do an analysis of this
