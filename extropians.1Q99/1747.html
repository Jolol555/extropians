<p>
I think we're getting a bit silly with this Y2K thing.

<p>
I work for a RBOC (Ameritech) and many of our Y2K teams are already
disbanding, every piece of hardware in my data center has a sticker
saying whether or not it is in compliance. all non-compliant items
will be gone by June 1st. The major C.O switches have been tested
as have all the links, so you will (at least here ;) ) have phone
service. The power companies were required to pass compliance on
this as well, and all C.O's have generators and big storage tanks.

<p>
<a name="1761qlink1">The number of x-military personnel outnumbers current levels by
many dozens to one.</a> When I was a Marine we used to have a saying,
the Russians don't fear the army, the navy, or even the air force,
they fear the NRA (this was before I was a member) 4 million plus
of the best equipped, most dedicated in the world. The last time
anybody counted the registered handguns in the Chicago area could
equip 40 or so divisions. That was the registered ones..... Chance
of the military taking over...... 0% 

<p>
Besides in many area's it will be winter, not prime time for
looting.....  ;) Besides riot's are illegal in Chicago, we haven't
had one since '68.


<p>
Have a couple of hundred cash on hand and a few weeks groceries,
and a box or two of ammo (at least a shotgun) maybe a portable
generator (or two, make a buck) and relax and enjoy the fun.
