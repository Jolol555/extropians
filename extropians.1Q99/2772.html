Tim,

<p>
<a name="2975qlink1">   I have considered forms of Coventry before, but not with so much
technological infrastructure.  I am worried about the annonymous part of your
suggestion.  There is a reason people have the right to face their accusers.</a>
<a name="2975qlink2">How could you be sure you weren't receiving different versions of the same
rumor (which might not even be true),</a> and how do you guard against some
<a name="2975qlink3">talented hacker doing a hatchet job on an innocent person's reputation?</a>  Also,
<a name="2975qlink4">is there any time that a person's privacy is restored to them?</a>  People are not
always the most forgiving, and what if someone<a name="2975qlink5"> has truly reformed, how are
they to overcome prejudice based on past status...</a>Maybe if there were some
<a name="2975qlink6">sort of certification process which could add to your datastream any positive
information about this person.</a>  I think these factors might weigh differently
<a name="2975qlink7">depending on what the offender has done wrong in the past.</a>  Oh, and who's
<a name="2975qlink8">paying for all this?  Criminal fines, perhaps?</a>
