  IAN: Might be worth seeing what Cmdr. 
  Donaldson says about that, see his

  interim report: <a href="http://twa800.com">http://twa800.com</a>

  If there's a case there, he'll

  probably know.

  IAN: The video was not an explanation
<br>
  of how or when victims died, but about 
  what witnesses supposedly saw. Since 
<br>
  the video violates many physical laws,
  it cannot be what witnesses saw.
