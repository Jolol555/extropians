<p>
Horses are sentient beings, and man has used horses extensively.  The
ethics of horse use are usually taken to be that the master owes the
horse decent treatment.  And a well-treated horse gives better value to
the master.


<p>
Monkeys and apes are considerably more intelligent and more socially
organized than horses, but man has not been able to get monkeys to use
their intelligence in the service of man.  Instead man has found monkeys
quite useful for medical experimentation.  But the treatment to which
monkeys are subjected is far worse than horses are treated, so it appears
that the ethics are inconsistent.  


<p>
If man builds an intelligent and sentient machine to serve him like a
slave, it may happen that the machine will complain if it is unhappy with
the situation.  Until that happens, there is no reason to believe that
most people will treat those machines any better than they treat animals
now.
