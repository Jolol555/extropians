<i>&gt; air than fuel to make an ignition.  Too rich and it wont even burn,</i><br>
<i>&gt; never</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind explode.  Having a fuel tank leak would cause some air to be vented</i><br>

<i>&gt; ratio</i><br>
<i>&gt; inside a fuel tank.</i><br>

<p>
The 15 to 1 air to fuel ratio is not magic. It is a ratio which requires</a> a high minimum air
<a name="2367qlink5">pressure level to ignite. At atmospheric pressure, a higher ratio</a> will easily ignite. Now,
<a name="2367qlink6">here's another idea: vacuum pressure. The plane was ascending thru</a> the mid teen levels. The
<a name="2367qlink7">tanks had been sealed at sea level and are partially pressurized. There</a> is obviously going
<a name="2367qlink8">to be enough pressure to encourage outflow from any even minor leaks</a> in the tank. Put that
<a name="2367qlink9">outflow near some sparking kapton wire, and BOOM. Moreover, since</a> the tank was mostly empty,
<a name="2367qlink10">its volume was not entirely a vapor version of the fuel. It was air</a> filled with fuel fumes.
<a name="2367qlink11">It is an ideally explosive setup. Ideal mixing, minimum swirl, etc.</a>

<a name="2367qlink1"><i>&gt; Perhaps.  This whole thread started with the contention (I think) that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the CIA report was trying to cover something by claiming a 29</i><br>
<i>&gt; second plunge of the crippled plane into the sea.  I realized that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the number 29 in itself is an indication they hoped to minimize the</i><br>
<i>&gt; time, just as Frys electronics puts a new electronic gazazzafratz on</i><br>
<i>&gt; sale for 29.99 because that sounds less than 30 bucks.  29 seconds,</i><br>
<i>&gt; well, thats less than half a minute.  I imagine it really took about a</i><br>
<i>&gt; full terrifying minute for the doomed, and likely conscious, passengers</i><br>
<i>&gt; to end their suffering.  I would still like to pretend it was only 29</i><br>
<i>&gt; seconds</i><br>
<i>&gt; even if I know better.  Either way, I suspect a fuel leak started a fire</i><br>
<i>&gt; outside the tank which then (somehow) caused the tank to explode.</i><br>

<p>
As I demonstrated, the 29 second time was for the nose section, which itself also had
</a>
<a name="2367qlink2">passengers, as well as the cockpit, where some of the black boxes</a> are, which would have
<a name="2367qlink3">recorded the time to impact.</a>

<a href="2209.html#2216qlink3">&gt; When I was a teenager, I and my friends were mentally retarded.  We</a><br>

<p>
Oh, yes. As kids we used to instant barbecue fish and frogs with bug spray flamethrowers....
he he he. "MMMM Tastes just like chicken!"

<i>&gt; surprisingly long time (a couple of minutes) in the fire, the can</i><br>
<i>&gt; finally</i><br>
