<p>
Perhaps I was unclear.  Let them press charges, if they wish.
I can *threaten* all I like, but actually choosing to do it (which is
what I meant by "want to" above) is another thing.  Most kids
will press charges only once, and will probably drop charges
as soon as they see the consequences.  Then it won't happen
again unless they are serious, and they'll *understand* what
liberty can cost (in this case, only a comfy place to crash and
the support of parents, but you get the idea).

<p>
<i>&gt;How do you know if they actually understand?</i><br>

<p>
I don't.  Of course, I don't know if *you* understand,
and I know many people whom I work with who don't
think about consequences, and are less responsible 
than many 10-year-olds.  After some point, people
either get it or don't, but I think that inducing the trauma,
however trivial in the big picture, of seeing their parents
or big brother/sister in court, on the opposite side, will
help many become more responsible and thoughtful who
otherwise might not be.  

<p>
<i>&gt;It's a tricky situation, most people will shy away from making children</i><br>
<i>&gt;responsible for their actions in a great way, but opinions on when they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually responsible vary immensely.</i><br>

<p>
Yes.  My position is simply that people (children included) are
responsible when they choose to be, or when no one else is
willing to be responsible for them any longer.
