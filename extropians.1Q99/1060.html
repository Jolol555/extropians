<i>&gt; I believe I have detected an interesting implicit assumption in your</i><br>

<i>&gt; realistic.  You seem to assume that your nanotech is controlled by a</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer system that can obey commands like "Go grab 2x10^6 comets from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oort cloud, merge them to make a giant projectile, and then smash it into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Earth."  The computer obligingly does so, with no muss or fuss.</i><br>

<a name="1077qlink1">You own implicit assumption which I find weak is that there needs</a> to be an AI to
<a name="1077qlink2">run this system. The thing with nanotech is that you can give</a> the little buggers
