<a name="2046qlink1">  IAN: Well, I hate to disagree with someone 
  who agreed with me, but I should point out, 
  since this is central to my point, that 0/0
  does have answers, in fact, its problem is
  that it can be shown to equal any number!</a> 

<p>
  A dejanews search of forum alt.math will 
  find a few threads on the topic, and the 
  prevailing view of mathematicians there
  is that 0/0 can be shown via several routs 
  to equal any number. However, obviously 
  this leads to fatal contradictions that 
  render 0/0 "indeterminate." Here's a way 
  I figured out for arguing why 0/0 = n,
  and the subsequent fatal contradiction:

<p>
<a name="2040qlink1">  IF a/b = c, then a/c = b.</a>

<p>
<a name="2040qlink2">  Since 0/6 = 0, 0/0 = 6.
<br>
  Since 0/2 = 0, 0/0 = 2.
<br>
  Ergo: 6 = 2... bOiNg!!!

<p>
  We arrive at an answer via legal means
  but find that the answers are errors.
<br>
  Yes, 0/n where n is nonzero is legal, 
  and always equals 0. As we can see, 
<br>
  /0 is chronically indeterminate.
