Go read 'Hitler's Willing Executioners' sometime; the author makes a fairly
convincing case that there was no inherent difference between the killers
and the rest of the German population, and that the population in general
believed that the Jews must be killed, regardless of how hard a task that
would be. It wasn't that there were just a few 'bad apples' in the German
population, but that the entire country was crazy.

I think assuming that other people in other places and other times thought

the same way as us is a major fallacy of historical analysis.
