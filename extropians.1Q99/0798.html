<p>
<a name="0833qlink1">I'm not sure why you would submit suggestions for new species
classifications to philosophy journals.  I realize that your expertise
is in philosophy, but if this is a serious suggestion for the extension
to the biological nomenclature, you need to send it for peer-review to
those who develop and confirm said nomenclature.  Unless the philosophy
journals you are considering are specifically<a name="0831qlink2"> intended to address the
</a>
philosophy of biological nomenclature, I would suggest that your
submission might be misdirected.
</a>

<p>
<a name="0833qlink2">If it has not been reviewed by a biologist, and if you do not have
specific training in biological</a> nomenclature, you could easily be
including very basic mistakes in your paper that would mar its serious
consideration.  Just as an example, are you aware that biologists</a> curse
the term "homosexual" as being unscientific?  It uses the Latin root
instead of the Greek prefix as do the terms "asexual," "bisexual,"
"heterosexual," "polysexual," and the like.  Whoever invented this term
did not know the proper biological conventions.  If you are not trained
in biological nomenclature, you could be making similar mistakes.

<p>
As with any international standards, there are committees and
international agreements within the scientific community as to which
standards are acceptable and which are being developed.  If you publish
your suggestions outside the system, this could also mar its serious
reception.  Imagine if someone published a suggested change to
astronomical nomenclature on their own, or to mathematical notation on
their own.  It would not only be ignored, but would probably be directly
denounced by the standards bodies as being apocryphal and unapproved.
They may even pass a standard against its use.  The committee that
developed HTML was so angered by Netscape and Microsoft publishing "HTML
3 compliant" browsers before the standard approval and with unofficial
and conflicting extensions, that they skipped version 3 and proclaimed
that any product claiming "HTML 3" was fraudulent.

<p>
I don't mean to sound negative here, but I just wanted to warn you about
some of the pitfalls you might encounter in proposing scientific
nomenclature if you are not aware of the proper procedures to do this.
