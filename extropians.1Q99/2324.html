<a href="2300.html#2324qlink1">&gt;&gt; What is the utility served by theology in an extropian context?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well Aaron, you've managed to restate Jason's case without adding anything;</i><br>

<p>
And you've managed to dodge the question once again. I reworded what Jason
initially wrote becuase it sounded as if you didn't understand what he was
saying.

<p>
<a href="2305.html#2324qlink2">&gt;except for the odd questioning of the accuracy of my perfectly adequate</a><br>
<i>&gt;expression of basic physical laws ("or at least approximations thereof").</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What's with that? Is this affectation part of your "sound memeset"?</i><br>

<p>
What I mean by this is that our formulas for physical laws may only be
close approximations. For more information, study the philosophy of
science...

<p>
<a href="2305.html#2324qlink3">&gt;The question you ignored remains...</a><br>

<p>
I have not ignored your question. I have asked why you would want to ask
such a question. I am still waiting for your answer.

<p>
<a href="2305.html#2324qlink4">&gt;I assert that God is an inevitable unescapable product of a technological</a><br>
<i>&gt;civilization that lasts long enough!  Can you prove me wrong?</i><br>

<p>
How can I prove you wrong? Can you prove it right? As Anders pointed out,
your hypothesis is not falsifiable. I agree that it is an interesting
thought-experiment, and yes, it is in the realm of possibility.

<p>
What has struck me odd from your previous postings is your burning desire
to construct an elaborate theology based on this premise. This is a
question I am asking you: Why would I, or any other extropian want to do
such a thing? Since you have now been asked it three times, will you please
answer it?
