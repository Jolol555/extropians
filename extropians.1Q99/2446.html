<a href="2430.html#2446qlink1">&gt; Incentive: I'll agree to contribute a minimum of $10,000 per</a><br>
<i>&gt; year to ExI for at least 5 years if we can make some progress</i><br>
<i>&gt; on this.</i><br>

<p>
Someone at ExI needs to jump on this and secure that money!  To do this,
a specific plan needs to be worked out, and some sort of objective
measurement for progress needs to be agreed to up front.  Don't let this
money slip away, and don't let this be a vague promise of support that
never goes anywhere.

<p>
There are many schemes for moderated lists.  My proposal is to have all
posts go through a team of moderators.  Those that are off-topic get
diverted to a second list called extropians2 (or something).  In this
way, no one is prevented from postings, and all conversations can
continue and can still be followed by those who want to see them.  Those
who want to read the more on-topic list can subscribe just to the main
list.  The key here is not to judge posts or control posting, just to
keep it on topic and divert off-topic posts to the secondary list.  I
think this will make everybody happy, but may slow down the list.  For
the kind of donation being offered, surely we can find volunteers to act
as monitors around the clock.  If you get enough volunteers, we can get
full coverage with only a little time from each volunteer.

<p>
If you don't like moderating, you can use automated keyword moderators
that divert certain keywords to the other list.  As soon as a thread
starts that seems off topic, the keywords or title can be added to the
automated list, and a message to the main list under that title can
state that the thread has been diverted to the second list.  This method
allows implementation after the fact.  Putting "guns", "TWA*800", "CIA",
"UFO" into the keyword list would divert current kookiness.

<p>
Maybe the number of posts sent to the secondary list can be used as an
objective measurement of what has been dekiikified off the main list.
Or maybe just the agreement that the chosen scheme (or any other) is
agreeable and that while it is in place (up to 5 years) Brian's money
will be donated.
