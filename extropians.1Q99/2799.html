<a name="2964qlink1">   I wholeheartedly agree that in future the Justice system should include
provisions for as full of Restitution as possible to the victims of crime from
the perpetrators.  But I do not believe this is adequate in and of itself.</a>
<a name="2964qlink2">For example, if<a name="2947qlink1"> you had enough resources you simply wouldn't care, you could
just do what you want and pay your way out</a> of it.  Also, this would not stop
<a name="2957qlink1"><a name="2947qlink2">the impoverished from committing crime, if you don't have anything to take,
what have you to lose?</a>  And lastly, there are some crimes where recompensation
</a>
<a name="2947qlink3">is impossible.  How do you recompensate the victims of murder and their
families?  Some things just can't be made right.</a>
