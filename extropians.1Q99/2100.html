Sorry about that. I guess I was having a bad day.  What I should have said
was something more like this:

<p>
Velikovsky's ideas are pure fantasy, so far removed from reality that no
serious astronomer would give them a second thought.  There seem to be a few
people who take him seriously, but most of them fall into the same category
as those guys who think the world is really flat and the Apollo moon
landings were all faked.  I try to avoid arguing with people like that
because it isn't productive - the discussion just degenerates into a flame
war.

<p>
Now, when someone who hasn't heard about Velikovsky asks about the subject,
I'll certainly fill them in on the story.  If you are interested in why some
particular point does or does not make sense, I'll be happy to pass on my
impression of the current consensus view.  The same thing goes for any other
dubious theory that may come up.
