<a href="1094.html#1185qlink1">&gt; &gt; Well, let's point out that the benefits of the corporate form are benefits</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; confered by governments, so in effect, the government has already provided</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; certain protections to orgainzations operating under the corporate form.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; While corporate structure in the US at present is government-defined</i><br>
<i>&gt; and supported, limited liability corporations /can/ exist without</i><br>
<i>&gt; such support.  So long as a trading firm in a free market openly</i><br>
<i>&gt; identifies itself as a limited liability corporation and specifies</i><br>
<i>&gt; in all its contracts that parties agree to limit the liability of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the firm to the assets of the firm independent of those of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; shareholders/directors, then no one is being coerced.  Of course, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the US, all that's required is that you have "Inc." in your name and</i><br>
<i>&gt; all those contract terms follow automatically, but those same terms</i><br>
<i>&gt; could also be negotiated in a free market.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; It is often argued that limited liability encourages investment</i><br>
<i>&gt; and enterprise, and that's probably true.  But that's /not/ a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; argument for government-fiat corporations; it's a good argument</i><br>
<i>&gt; for freely contracted limited liability corporations.</i><br>

<p>
Your vision of a "freely contracted limited liability corporation" does not
comport with the expectation of most investors who would put their money
into a limited liabilty corporation.  Rather, what you envision really just
a matter of non-recourse contracting.  But not all economic interaction
takes place at the level of contracts.

<p>
Did you not read the rest of my post?  The following seems to have been
overlooked:

<p>
<i>&gt; It is not at all clear to me</i><br>
<a href="1086.html#1185qlink2">&gt; that a potential tort-victim (as opposed to a contract partner) would</a><br>
<i>&gt; voluntarily agree to limit his potential claim for injuries in such a</i><br>
<i>&gt; manner (perhaps he would from a Rawls-ian "original position," but that</i><br>
<i>&gt; line of argument is by no means universally accepted, and I won't go into</i><br>
<i>&gt; it here).  Yet without such limits, capital-owners would be _far_ more</i><br>
<i>&gt; hesitant in making investments over which they have minimal management</i><br>
<i>&gt; control.  (Would you invest in Microsoft if Netscape could come after your</i><br>
<i>&gt; entire personal net worth for Bill Gates' alleged tortious competition?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Replace with Bhopal if you don't think that business torts would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; protected under a PPL system)</i><br>

<p>
The tort-victim never contracted to accept the limited liability of the
investors in the above examples.

<p>
If investors did not have this marginal additional protection imposed by
state fiat, we could posit that the changed risk-reward ratio would likely
result in a marginal decrease in the amount of equity investement.  I find
it an intersting question whether that would be a "Good Thing" (which, to
an economist, generally equals "more efficient")
