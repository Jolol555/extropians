I don't think either of these two examples, jury nullification and
armed rebellion, have traditionally been used to restrain the initiation
of force.  Both of these approaches have often been used to further the
use of force by the majority against the minority.

<a name="3485qlink1">Jury nullification was primarily used in the Old South to make sure that
white defendants were acquitted of crimes against blacks (lynchings,
beatings, robbery, etc.).</a>  And of course the biggest armed rebellion
the U.S. has seen was its Civil War, which was largely motiviated by
the South's wish to continue to allow the whites to enslave the blacks.
