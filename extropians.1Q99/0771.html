Aha!  That's it:  impose lower speed limits - it plays to the same interests
of fine collections and insurance, _and_ saves lives.  (I mean, of course, after
studies, etc.)   
<br>
The problem with that though is that it's _creative_, it's something _new_,
and the big organizations will not want to flip their arguments 180% degrees.
Besides needed thinking, this would demonstrate that their true motives are to
create a controlled environment which they can benefit from, rather than save
anybody's time.

As for the innocent people getting killed - I agree, that's an issue.
And we don't know the extent of it.  Why?  Because the statistical agencies
don't care about this, apparently.
<br>
I didn't mean to post a comprehensive analysis of the issues.
I don't have the data, the expertise, or the time.
All I meant to demonstrate that the few numbers published in the study 
support the opposite conclusion form what they are trying to make.

<a name="0774qlink1">It's a general problem with economic calculations - they do not take into
account at all the ultimate benefits people want to receive from the economic
system, such as free time, knowledge of the world, freedom, and happiness.</a>

<p>
So all economic indicators count the progress of the machine world.
Looks like the machines already rule the planet, and humans just serve them.
