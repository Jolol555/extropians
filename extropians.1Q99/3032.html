Yes, this winter in the northeast US was slightly colder and slightly wetter
than the norm. We didn't have a total thaw in late January like we usually
have, but we are getting more early and late snowfall as well. Its March and we
are still getting temps below zero F at night, barely hitting the 20-30 deg F
range during the day. Of course local conditions are not 'representative' of
the system.

<p>
The stats I find interesting is that those that claim global warming say that
it is triggering more very violent storms, hurricanes, etc., yet when you look
at the hurricane data, something like 75% of the most dangerous, high power,
and damagine hurricanse on record for the 20th century occured before the
middle of the century. This is a significant and incontrovetible indication
that the predictions of the global warming claimers are off by a wide margin.

To me, global warming is a non issue for extropians. By the time it is a
problem to us, we will be able to fix it with a quick nano-tech recipe. I also
see it as having good aspects:


<OL>
  <li>  it will prod island nations to invest money in developing floating and
submersed community construction techniques.
  <li>  island nations will lobby for the UN to recognise sea-mount based
communities as sovereign nations
  <li>  poorer island nations which can't afford to build their own floating or
submersed facilites will attract investment with incentives like the
Seychelle's bank account/consul law. We could wind up with an extropian country
just by being patient and biding our time.
