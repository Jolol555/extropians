<a href="2113.html#2120qlink1">&gt;&gt;Hm.  Does this mean that you and Max now (or always did?!) advocate</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;the use of force for political purposes?  Perhaps I have misunderstood you?</i><br>

<br>
<a href="2113.html#2120qlink2">&gt;I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about in the</a><br>
<i>&gt;above-sentence.</i><br>
<a name="2124qlink1">He is noting that not being a libertarian means that you believe in using 
force to compel individuals to obey authority: that is the core 
definition of libertarianism: no first-use force, ever.</a>

<p>
<a href="2113.html#2120qlink3">&gt;What I advocate is freedom of choice. </a><br>
That doesn't answer the question?<a name="2124qlink2"> Do you believe that it is moral to use 
force to achieve political ends?</a> To make this concrete, is it transhuman 
<a name="2124qlink3">to have freedom of choice about paying taxes?</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;As far as I understand, Extropy</i><br>
<a href="2113.html#2120qlink4">&gt;Institute does not align itself with any one political party.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="2124qlink4">Libertarianism is not a party anymore than republicans "are" capitalism. 
Parties are at best imperfect instantiations of a philosophy.
