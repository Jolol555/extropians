<a name="3836qlink1"><i>&gt;I want to create a school for polymaths. Students would be able to choose</i><br>
<a href="3715.html#3834qlink1">&gt;modules from science and philosophy combining them in whatever way they</a><br>
feel
<br>
<a href="3715.html#3834qlink2">&gt;appropriate to create an entirely unique and flexible course of study.</a><br>
There
<br>
<a href="3715.html#3834qlink3">&gt;will be no set course length and students will be encouraged to 'bring in'</a><br>
<i>&gt;other areas of study and give lectures to other students. I would like the</i><br>

<a name="3870qlink1"><a name="3848qlink1">Have you ever heard of the concept of "unschooling?" There</a> is a school
called the Sudbury Valley School which has been working this concept since
1970. There are several basic premises, but for the most part they all
revolve around the fact that children WANT to learn and that all we as
teachers and adults need to do is get the hell out of their way, unless they
come to us with questions. There are no structured classes or courses</a> of any
kind, and learning takes place when the children are ready to learn. It is
then up to the child if he needs help from a teacher or if he feels he can
learn better on his own. If a child wants to learn to read at age 3, fine.
If he's not ready until he's 7, fine. If he is encouraged to be curious and
nutured in the the right environment, he WILL learn. And, without the evils
of tradional schooling to break him down, his curiousity will continue into
adulthood, and he will have the confidence to learn whatever he desires.

I could go on and on about this topic, if anyone is interested.
