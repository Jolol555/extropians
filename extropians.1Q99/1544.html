<p>
Apologies if this is not of interest to those on this list.  However,
Rand is a philosopher who has had a big impact -- for better or
for worse --  on our movement, do you think?

<p>
This is a follow-up to an earlier announcement; I received many 
inquiries about this book from PNS subscribers.  This follow-up 
includes additional information about the just-published volume:
It is February 2, 1999, the 94th anniversary of Ayn Rand's birth - - 
and the publication day for a landmark anthology that engages Rand's 
system of thought from the diverse perspectives of contemporary 
feminism.
<br>
FEMINIST INTERPRETATIONS OF AYN RAND, co-edited by Mimi Reisel 
Gladstein and Chris Matthew Sciabarra, has been published by Penn 
State Press as part of its series, "Re-Reading the Canon." 
 Ultimately, this series will feature more than twenty volumes, each 
devoted to another major philosopher in the Western canon.  Rand takes 
her place alongside such thinkers as Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, 
and Nietzsche.
<br>
The Rand volume, printed simultaneously in paperback and clothbound 
editions, features four reprinted articles and fifteen original 
essays.  Contributors are:  Barbara Branden, Nathaniel Branden, Diana 
Mertz Brickell, Susan Love Brown, Susan Brownmiller, Mimi Reisel 
Gladstein, Thomas Gramstad, Melissa Jane Hardie, Barbara Grizzuti 
Harrison, Valerie Loiret-Prunet, Wendy McElroy, Karen Michalson, 
Camille Paglia, Sharon Presley, Robert Sheaffer, Joan Kennedy Taylor, 
Barry Vacker, and Judith Wilt.

Penetrating reviews of this controversial and provocative book can be 
found on the website.
<br>
A structured, moderated discussion of this explosive volume will begin 
on March 1, 1999 on the Randian-Feminism on-line discussion list.  For
