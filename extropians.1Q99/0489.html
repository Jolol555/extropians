  IAN: I agree. There's an interesting correlation
<a name="0498qlink1">  between serial killers, like Jeffrey Dommer (sp?),
  and torture of animals, such that a high percentage
  of the most brutal serial killers first tortured
  animals, usually when they were kids. They see
  the similarity between humans and animals, but
  only in the worst ways imaginable.</a> With this,
  we can see that the way person x treats animals
  is a measure of how person x could treat humans.
  A society that was particularly brutal toward
  animals would probably<a name="0506qlink1"> be more inclined than 
  the less brutal society to effect</a> various 
  forms of brutality on the human animal.
