<a name="1645qlink1">Yes. Please.<a name="1596qlink1"> However, why can't mail servers that the recipient belongs to

script that does just that....I wish I weren't so busy with my own ISP
startup.

If the Electronic Freedom Foundation is what its cracked up to be, they could
easily launch a campaign to get unverified message bouncers installed on any
ISP mail server on which a customer requests it, and give the customer the
ability to turn it on or off...
