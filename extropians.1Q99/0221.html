Yeah -- I used to have a theory that Tom Clancy was actually a Naval
Intelligence "construct": It was just too improbable that some insurance
salesman from Kansas who'd never steered a boat in his life or written a word
of fiction could come out of nowhere with "The Hunt for Red October".  So I
figured he'd been "given" the novel by Naval Intell because it was full of
convincing disinformation, especially about SOSUS.  Then, along came "Red
Strom Rising" and his detailed description of the "F-19 Frisbee" that turned
out to be like what we THOUGHT the stealth program was creating, but was in
fact all wrong (it actually sounds like what the F-22 will eventually</a> be).

<a name="0235qlink1"><a name="0225qlink3">So now, we have "Spike", a propulion engineer from Lockheed, who tells us just
enough about aerospikes to be convincing</a> . . . .
