It might work for the trigger, if you can make it small enough.  That would
remove the need for plutonium, but you still need a very large amount of
deuterium and/or tritium to get a large explosion.

You can't burn anything 1,000 meters down - no oxygen, right?  Antimatter
reactors are possible, but would have to be rather large (you need to absorb
the gamma radiation to capture the energy, and that takes a lot of matter).
Conventional batteries don't hold enough power to dig themselves down to a
deep construction site.  IMO, your best bet is actually to drop a power line
from the surface - you'll need a small pipeline to move material in and out
of the worksite anyway.  Failing that, build a burrowing robot with a
nuclear reactor.  Either way, however, you need something much bigger than a
pack of nanobots.

<p>
<a href="1053.html#1059qlink3">&gt; And remember, the best place to find deuterium is in the</a><br>

<p>
True enough - but to make gigaton-range weapons you need *tons* of the
stuff, and probably tritium as well.  Even then, you need several dozen
bombs to do a good job of wrecking the world (or hundreds, if diamondoid
buildings are common).  Its hard to collect that much without making it
obvious what you're up to - either your robots end up hot enough to show up
on orbital surveillance, or you end up with a lot of gigantic,
heavily-shielded vehicles that the neighbors are going to wonder about.

<p>
<a name="1063qlink1">Now, all of this is not to say that it can't be done.  It just can't be done
by diffuse, nearly-undetectable swarms of nanobots.  You need macro-scale
machines for a lot of essential roles, and macro-scale machinery is hard</a> to
hide.
