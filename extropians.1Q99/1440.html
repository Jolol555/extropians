Seems to me that by now the Spammers have reached our shore .... I had
three mails offering various "services" in my inbox this morning. Two
came from this listserver. Perhaps the access to post in this group
should be restricted to registered members of the mailing list. Should
be possible.

<p>
Some years ago, when commercialization hit the net, I hoped that this
would pass just like bad weather. Seems I was wrong. Each time I think
that ba now it's enough, some freaks discover a new way of making the
net more annoying. As I seldom use search engines, I did not recognize
by now that they are SPAMmed too. The newsgroups, though, have to be
considered obsolete.

<p>
<a name="1446qlink1">What to do? I recently read that the US government, pushed by the
lobby of SPAMmers, wants to legalize SPAM. SPAM is illegal today, but
things seem to change. Let's hope that this won't happen.
</a>

<p>
Perhaps it would help if anonymous accounts would be banned from
newsgroup posting. Perhaps it would help it mail services like gmx or
bigfoot would not allow mass mailings AKA SPAM. I recently tested gmx
and found out that it is no problem to make some easy mass mailings
from their system.

<p>
<a name="1446qlink2">The actual plan of the European parliament shows us some more drastic
way to stop the SPAM flood from the US: If the US servers allow SPAM
to be sent over the net, the transatlantic connection can be cut! This
would cut the European net from the rest of the world, but it would
also stop most of the SPAM!
</a>

<p>
The most efficient way to avoid this junk would be the capitalistic
one: Allow mass mailings, but let the dumb ass who wants to send them
pay all the costs to post and transmit them. That would definitely
help!
