<a name="1816qlink1">J. Eric Mortensen  said to everyone

<p>
<a href="1789.html#1814qlink1">&gt;Hello everyone, this seems to be a good time to come out of my </a><br>
<i>&gt;transhumanist closet:</i><br>

<p>
Sounds more like coming out of the creationist closet to me.

<p>
<i>&gt;Will you not agree that some day we may discover that </i><br>
<a href="1789.html#1814qlink2">&gt;the universe was created by some entity and that we in some</a><br>
<i>&gt;way might  ask it why it did so?</i><br>

<p>
nope. never.<a name="1817qlink1"> Unless you have evidence that time is something other than 
the motion of matter, you must accept that just as it cannot be 
destroyed, it cannot be created.</a></a>

<p>
Accepting this sort of possibility (like accepting that ESP "might" 
underlie much of what happens around us) travels under the guise of 
openness and sophistication, as in 

<p>
"oh haven't you read Popper, aren't aware of Kuhn's work ...we must not 
be dogmatic"

<p>
However, it requires that we not be objectivists. It requires that we be 
willing to believe nothing and/or everything, because anything  "might" 
be true. 

<p>
ZhuangZi: Look how happy those fish are!
HuiZi:       You're not a fish; how can you know they are happy?
ZhuangZi: You're not me; how do you know I don't know?

<p>
Now, HuiZi cannot deny this. What is he to do? 

<p>
He cannot claim access to any objective knowledge, and so, in guiding his 
life he must either become dice-man, acting as a degenerate whimsy, or 
else simply follow the majority, or Stalin, or whoever claims to be in 
possession of the zeitgeist. That is the consequence of accepting that 
there is only zeitgeist. That was pretty much Kuhn's position: sucessive 
theories fit more data but they nevertheless are in no sense superior. He 
stated plainly in SSR that  Einstein's theory is not objectively superior 
to Newtons, which in turn is not objectively superior to Aristotle's. The 
political counterpoint is the argument that there is no such thing as 
progress.

<p>
It requires us to think that Einstein's superior fit to the world is just 
a bit of good luck really, and that adding accessory hypotheses could 
make Newton everybit as good-a-fit-to-the-world (it could) and every bit 
as good. this latter i, and Lakatos, (and presumably most Objectivists) 
dispute. 

<p>
Everyone should read Lakatos. Go and buy a copy now: it is a perfect 
reduction of the insights of Popper and Kuhn and tells you how honest 
science is done. 

<p>
It  has the strength of being written, as Rand's works do, by someone who 
has direct experience of what abandoning objectivity causes (i.e., 
slavery, poverty, and death).

<p>
Religion (creation) is a philosophy of human subjugation to "truths" 
which are immune to test. Transhumanism is a philosophy of boundless 
growth, premised on our objective knowledge of a world which has a nature.

<p>
much love  ;-),
