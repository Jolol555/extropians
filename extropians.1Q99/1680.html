<a href="1679.html#1680qlink1">&gt; Not to mention optimism and positive memes. Have you noted the quite</a><br>
<i>&gt; transhuman ads for big corporations on CNN and Discovery? Slogans like</i><br>

<i>&gt; We move because we hate the idea of standing still.</i><br>

Ack!  I *hate* these kinds of ads.  This kind of content-free verbiage
is becoming the new double-speak, along with "integrity" and "quality"
programs.  The are the new buzz words that can't be measured, and make
the customer feel good without really saying anything or offering
anything.

<p>
<a name="1695qlink2">Take the above example, for example.  I still don't know what they're
selling.  I just feel like it must be good whatever</a> it is.  The boils
down to "Trust us, we're doing the right thing for *you*!"  This is
psychological persuasion without product competition.  This is asking me
to choose their company without the information to do so.  What do they
create?  What can we rise above?  What is their mission?

<p>
<a name="1695qlink3">The reason that these memes sound so positive is because your
subconscious fills in the lack of details and you think it totally
agrees with your extropian position.  A white supremacist Klu Klux Klan
member would probably thing that those words apply to him.  The words
mean nothing.</a>
