"...the astronomical community still persists in assuming that the redshift is a valid
distance indicator from which they incorrectly deduce that quasars are
extra-galactic...The problem is that if the quasars are at cosmological distances the
rapid intensity variations appear to require unacceptably large energies [e.g.
Pauliny-Toth,I.I.K., Kellermann,K.I.: 1966, Astrophys.J. 146, 634] ... The reason for
this is that, if, as has been commonly assumed, significant fluctuations in intensity
cannot occur in times less than the light travel time across the source without
'blurring' the observed variation, then the observations put a limit on the linear
dimensions typically of the order of one light year. If the quasars are at cosmological
distances, then this corresponds to angular sizes well under 10^-3 arcsec and magnetic
fields less than 10^-5 G. In such weak fields, the energy in the form of relativistic
particles required to explain the observed radio emission is then typically greater than
10^58 erg generated in one year or less. Even in these days when violent events in
quasars and the nuclei of galaxies are commonly accepted, the thought of energy
generation at the rate of 10^51 erg/sec lasting one year or more seems too fantastic for
most to accept. For this reason, it was suggested that quasars were not at cosmological
distances ..."

QUASAR TON 202 IS WITHIN OUR GALAXY.

<p>
Varshni,Y.P., Talbot,J.P.: 1995, unpublished notes.

<p>
A careful search through Luyten's (1969) proper  motion survey for quasars from the
Hewitt and Burbidge (1993) catalog reveals that the bright quasar TON 202 (QSO 1425+267)
has a proper motion of 0.053±0.016 arcsec/year, about the same motion as NGC 7293 or
Helix. A previous search of this catalog  by Varshni (1982) found 30 quasars, 3 of which
had very large proper motions. A more recent search uncovered 10 more quasars, including
TON 202. The proper motion of TON 202 is perpendicular to the orientation of it's radio
lobes (Rogora et al., 1986). If it is truly as far as it's redshift implies (z=0.362)
it's tranverse velocity would be of the order of one thousand times the speed of light,
a clear indication that the cosmological redshift hypothesis is completely untenable.
Which leads us to conclude that this quasar is a star within our galaxy (Varshni, 1973,
1974a, 1974b, 1975, 1979, 1982, 1988) the strong optical emission lines are due to
recombination laser action in a rapidly expanding stellar atmosphere. This is by no
means an isolated case : Kron and Chiu (1981) have discovered QSOs with large proper
motions one of them significant to 7 sigma. These facts explain the failure of HST to
detect 'host galaxies' around many QSO. Considering the brightness of TON 202 (V=15.63),
confirming the large proper motion should not present any particular observational
difficulties with present day CCD equipment.

The mean error in the existing measurements of the proper motions of quasars are rather
large. Any
<br>
conclusion on this question is subject to this important qualification. In most of the
reported cases, all
<br>
that we can say is that the proper motion is about or less than 0.015 arcsec/yr.
