<a name="1332qlink1"><a name="1326qlink1">I was thinking about your example of an individual who had acces to a
computer.  I think that quite possibly such an individual might be
considered a primitive future human... you know what I mean?  Is
anybody else thinking similar thoughts?  I mean,<a name="1346qlink1"> a computer being a
primitive neural extension,</a> and a keyboard or mouse or whatever a
primitive neural connection, could it not be that one's
IQ-plus-computer or IQ-plus-net could be considered a measure of your
intelligence as an advanced individual?  It may be really silly,
but.....

it's a thought.

<i>&gt; &gt; Since there seems to be a fair amount of interest in the topic,</i><br>
I've decided
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink2">&gt; &gt; to go ahead and post what I've got so far (in sections, of</a><br>
course).  The
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink3">&gt; &gt; final version of all of this will (hopefully) end up as a</a><br>
paper-length
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink4">&gt; &gt; treatment of the topic, but it has a ways to go before its ready</a><br>
for that.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink5">&gt; This looks like a great start.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Now, intelligence in this sense is not a unitary entity.  It is</i><br>
perfectly
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink6">&gt; &gt; possible to be good at solving one class of problems, and do a</a><br>
poor job of
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink7">&gt; &gt; solving others.  There is a very large (possibly infinite) number of</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; different problem domains in which an intelligent entity might</i><br>
have some
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink8">&gt; &gt; ability.  Some of these domains are related to each other, such</a><br>
that a high
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink9">&gt; &gt; level of ability in one domain can be used to solve problems in</a><br>
the related
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink10">&gt; &gt; domains.  Other problem domains are independent of each other, and</a><br>
require
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink11">&gt; &gt; completely different problem-solving approaches.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The nature of intelligence is somewhat controversial, tied in to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; dispute over whether intelligence is heritable, and whether different</i><br>
<i>&gt; races have differences in intelligence.  As you say, there are a</i><br>
<i>&gt; number of different skills which can be identified as part of overall</i><br>
<i>&gt; "intelligence".  One disputed point is whether there is correlation</i><br>
<i>&gt; among these abilities.  Do people who are better at memorizing lists,</i><br>
<i>&gt; say, also tend to have better logical deduction skills?  Are better</i><br>
<i>&gt; readers also better at math?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Apparently the statistical data is ambiguous enough that controversy</i><br>
<i>&gt; remains, although it is possible that the high political stakes are</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough to explain it.  The hypothetical correlation factor is called</i><br>
"g",
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink12">&gt; the general intelligence.  My impression is that most studies show</a><br>
that
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink13">&gt; there is such a factor, that broadly speaking people who are better at</a><br>
<i>&gt; some mental skills tend to be better at others, but there is</i><br>
definitely
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink14">&gt; considerable variation in abilities.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The answer to this apparent contradiction is also the reason why</i><br>
so many
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink15">&gt; &gt; people think of intelligence as a single ability.  Picture a graph</a><br>
with
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink16">&gt; &gt; different cognitive abilities along the X-axis, and increasing</a><br>
ability along
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink17">&gt; &gt; the Y-axis, so that the graph depicts varying ability levels in</a><br>
different
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink18">&gt; &gt; problem domains.  What we commonly call 'intelligence' is the area</a><br>
under
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink19">&gt; &gt; this curve, with various distortions based on our own ideas about</a><br>
which
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink20">&gt; &gt; abilities are important.  Different humans may have different</a><br>
levels of
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink21">&gt; &gt; ability in each problem domain, but we expect the total area under</a><br>
the curve
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink22">&gt; &gt; to fall within a given range.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This should be a bar (column) graph; I think the various cognitive</i><br>
skills
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink23">&gt; would be discrete rather than continuous.  (Although this may be in</a><br>
part
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink24">&gt; an artifact of the factor analysis technique, which inherently</a><br>
identifies
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink25">&gt; discrete basis vectors.)</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The difficult issue as you try to generalize this to</i><br>
super-intelligence
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink26">&gt; is how to scale the Y axis.  With humans, we can test people and come</a><br>
<i>&gt; up with a range of scores which we can normalize with a desired mean</i><br>
and
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink27">&gt; standard deviation.  However the nature of tests is such that there</a><br>
may be
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink28">&gt; no unambiguous way to extrapolate them beyond the range of abilities</a><br>
seen.
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink29">&gt; As a simple example, you can't do better than 100% on a test.  A test</a><br>
<i>&gt; may not be able to produce meaningful data outside of a given range.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even with open-ended tests, like how quickly something can be done, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; how many numbers you can remember, it is not clear how to measure an</i><br>
<i>&gt; ability which is beyond the human level, in quantitative terms.  How</i><br>
<i>&gt; much better do you have to do on a test to have an IQ of 400 rather</i><br>
than
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink30">&gt; 350?  What would such values mean?</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; An interesting point this suggests is that a person, today, who is</i><br>
allowed
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink31">&gt; to "cheat" on an IQ test by having access to computers and other</a><br>
helpful
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink32">&gt; devices, could probably score very highly on some of the sub-tests.</a><br>
<i>&gt; He could "remember" sequences of virtually any length, for example.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (All he really needs is pencil and paper for that.)  He could come</i><br>
<i>&gt; up with synonyms, and might be able to handle geometric problems more</i><br>
<i>&gt; easily as well.  The standard formulas assemble the sub-tests into an</i><br>
<i>&gt; overall score, and his massively increased ability in some areas would</i><br>
<i>&gt; increase his apparent IQ, possibly significantly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This leads to a couple of conclusions.  First, such an "augmented"</i><br>
<i>&gt; person is effectivelly more intelligent than an ordinary human. </i><br>
This is
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink33">&gt; unsurprising; it is one reason our culture has advanced from caveman</a><br>
days.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink34">&gt; But second, it shows that the tests don't always produce meaningful</a><br>
<i>&gt; results when taken outside their intended range.  A test of memory</i><br>
is more
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink35">&gt; relevant when measuring brain capacity than paper capacity.  Someone</a><br>
who
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink36">&gt; can memorize hundreds of digits on hearing them has an amazing mental</a><br>
<i>&gt; ability, and this would show up in his IQ score; but someone who can</i><br>
write
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink37">&gt; down hundreds of digits and read them back is just an ordinary person,</a><br>
<i>&gt; and he doesn't deserve to have his IQ score boosted by a formula</i><br>
created
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink38">&gt; with the intention of testing a purely mental ability.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; We can therefore say that an entity has human-equivalent</i><br>
intelligence if it
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink39">&gt; &gt; meets the same criterion: its total ability in the relevant</a><br>
problem domains
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink40">&gt; &gt; must fall within the same range as that of humans.  A transhuman</a><br>
entity
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink41">&gt; &gt; would be one whose total ability falls well beyond the human</a><br>
range, and an
<br>
<a href="1306.html#1319qlink42">&gt; &gt; SI would be an entity with an astronomically large total ability.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What is an SI?  A Super-Intelligence?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &lt;to be continued&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Looking forward to seeing more...</i><br>
