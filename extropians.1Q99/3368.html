I think the fact that this didn't burst my bubble may have some small
effect.  The actual deconstruction of the writing will only cause him
to build more irrational defenses.  I like to think that the more
irrational defenses needed for the sole purpose of supporting a meta
meme, the more vulnerable it is to collapse.  There are a lot of fully
indoctrinated ex-christians on this list that took the time and effort
to build a self consistent rational world view.  Remember the "Aha
Experiences" thread?  Each one of them experienced this painful
buildup and collapse.  So all I can offer is to force the infected
subject to build up more irrational defenses with hopes that the virus
will be inoculated  by seeming to underestimate the host's
intelligence - so to speak.  

<p>
I was also planning on tracking down the author and where ever the
author posted this, and forwarding the deconstuction with full credits
to the one who does the work.  The author needs to know that just
because you can get away with these kinds of fallacies verbally to a
friendly audience doesn't mean that if you put them in writing for
wide distribution on the net the fallacies are so easily overlooked.
