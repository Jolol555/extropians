Mark wrote seriously (apparently) in response to a joke about the IRS:

He he he hehe ha ha ha ha ha he ho ho ho ho hoho.......
Could you possibly have made a more fomulaic response? btw, you don't
capitalize the term "Federal Government" unless you are either totally
brainwashed or borderline Ted Kazinski....

<p>
The US federal government was once a model system of minimal government
intrusion into the lives of ordinary people, that respected the founding
concept that all rights originate in the individual and that the government is
merely a delegated recipient of the authority which individuals decide to let
it use. In some areas its getting even better, but in amny other ways it is
getting far worse. Mad bombers and wackos like Tim McVeigh, Ted Kazinski,
Aryan Nation, Koresh, and others are not born, they are made by a lifetime of
government opression and intrusion into the lives of people in many ways. If
our government were as good as you say, we would not have as many of these
nuts running around taking actions like they do.

<p>
I once worked for the federal government in the military. I have never seen
more graft, waste and abuse in my entire life than in the last year I was in
the service. I have never seen as much arrogant self important rationalized
government intrusion into peoples lifes as I have seen in the government in
the last 5 years. People wonder why nobody gives a damn about the impeachment
trial in the Senate, or of the President's behavior, its because more and more
people know that the whole system is a scam run and perpetuated by crooks,
liars, cheats, and theives, and all they can hope to get for their tax dollars
is some entertainment value from watching it on the tube and in the papers.

<p>
As for your comment about 'good honest hardworking men and women' who work for
the government: While I admit there are a lot of brainwashed people who still
beleive that the government serves a purpose that cannot be served any other
way, anyone who eats from the public trough is eating out of MY wallet, and
has larceny in their hearts if they don't want to find a productive job in the
private sector.
