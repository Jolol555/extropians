I read "Voyage to Yesteryear", not long ago, and I'd agree that there's a
problem with it, though perhaps not quite as bad a problem, for an sf novel,
as the above comment might indicate. In the novel there's this starship from
Earth bringing a whole township full of very officious Euroamerican
beauracrats, all the way across light years of space to meddle in the affairs
of a well established colony of an Alpha Centauran planet. Right off, it's a
setup for the original settlers to stand up for their own goals, some kind of
fun possiblities, there, perhaps. At the same time, the problems and political
shenagans of the would-be takeover artists seem reasonably dramatic and
familiar enough, it's the whole idea of colonialism all over again.

<p>
The problem with the novel is that the totally moneyless, robot driven society
of the Centaurans seems just plain unbelievable, no matter what Hogan has his
characters say about "no need to work for money, now we have robots, now we
have nuclear energy, we were raised by a tribe of robots, we're free of the
past", etcetera. For instance, the Centauran director of a power
station/research institute is said to hold her position *purely* by
acclamation from her coworkers, no question of needing to be appointed by
funds providers, no question of coworkers causing strife by nominating lots of
different people for the job, in competition with one another? In the
discussion that takes place when the better natured colonialists and
Centaurans begin to mingle, it is actually said that real disagreement can't
happen, because the more unreasonable parties would be shot! It's as though
every institution would have to be run by a tremendously influential or
charismatic cult leader, there'd be no other basis for allocating resources in
that situation. As a fabled sf Utopia, it's not too bad, but if it were real
life -- brrr!
