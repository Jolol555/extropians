If I did not create it, it would not be there. There is no need for any other
reason. My right to create as I please.

<p>
On the contrary. If the government mandates loyalty implants on currently
existing individuals, it is violating their rights. If the government mandates
loyalty implants be engineered into the genome of my child, it is violating MY
right to procreate as I please. Similarly, if the government mandates that I
place loyalty implants on an AI (or mandates that I do not) it is violating my
rights to create. Now, my fellow humans have rights to not be violated by the
actions of my creations, just as they have the rights to not be violated by the
actions of my procreations, my children, so I as the creator have a
responsibility to my fellow man to instill at least a minimal instruction set in
my children or my AI, since I undertook the responsibility of creating them.

<p>
Since the government is a fiction which cannot produce children, it has no right
to create new intelligent beings, nor does it have the right to patent things in
and of itself (there must always be a person to whom a patent is credited to),
and since revolution against tyrannical government is a recognised right of
humanity, the government has no right to mandate that I install a loyalty
implant.
