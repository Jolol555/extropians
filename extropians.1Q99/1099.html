<a name="1100qlink1"> ON A SKEPTICAL NOTE...

<p>
 In my brief inquiry into possible explanations for the facts 
 outlined in the ENS news reports about mysterious spraying 
 from jets [1], it's my assessment at this time that some
 innocuous explanations are taking the lead. Here's why:</a>


<UL>
<a name="1100qlink2">  <li>  The major bug I've discovered with the accounts of 
  cobwebs and "angle hair" falling from aircraft and UFOs 
  is that all the accounts I've found have the witnesses 
  claiming that the material "disappears" when they try 
  to collect it! I suppose it could suddenly melt and turn 
  to a gas (as is claimed) whenever people get near it(?!); 
  however, claims that the evidence is gathered by it keeps 
  disappearing before it can be tested are suspect on their 
  face! My request for information about the four samples 
  of "angel hair" ENS reported remains unanswered. I can
  only assume and hope that, if those samples were taken 
  successfully as indicated, they didn't also disappear.</a>

  <li>  Spray from aircraft that is said to HAVE been tested
<br>
  [2] is claimed to be jet fuel. Not that dumping jet fuel <br>
  on people is not bad, but that sounds more like routine 
  pilot-negligence than evidence of a secret operation. 

  <li>  I've also heard talk about photographs and videos of 
  the complex-contrail patterns these jets are said to make, 
  but no such evidence has been presented, and what I have 
  seen presented as evidence are photos showing nothing but 
  an average number of one or two contrails in the sky! But 
  what is more, it turns out that seeing weather-modifica-
  tion activity is not as unusual as one might assume:

  <li>  The ENS report cited 11 states wherein witnesses have 
  observed unusual contrail patterns and cloud-seeding-like
  aerial activity. My Internet searches proved that of those 
  states, 3 have official nonclassified cloud-seeding programs.
   Also, 6 other states are involved in an open-
  -public NOAA wether-modification program. 


</UL>
<p>
  In all, I found 10 states involved in nonclassified 
  cloud-seeding programs.[3] Considering you can't find 
  everything after only a few hours of searching the www, 
  it stands to reason that there are probably still more 
  nonclassified cloud-seeding activities around the nation.

<p>
  Of course, based on the military's own information, it 
  stands to reason that classified weather-modification 
  activities are also happening. But the fact that widespread
   weather modification is occurring on an open 
  basis means that witness accounts of activity fitting 
  that profile are not necessarily significant. For me, 
  these facts significantly reduce (but do not eliminate)
   the gravity of the mysterious-contrail case.
