<p>
Let's see how complicated it could possibly be, the human genome is 6
billion base pairs long, there are 4 bases so each base can represent 2
bits and there are 8 bits per byte. That comes out to 1.5 gigabytes,
however 80% of that is junk DNA so the working genome of the entire
human body is 300 megabytes. A chimpanzee's genome is only about 1%
different from a human one, so I think I'm being very generous if I say
that 10% of our working DNA involves intelligence. Thus a seed
intelligence able to grow in power as it interacts with the environment
as a newborn baby does can be specified with just 30 megabytes and
probably much less.</a>

<p>
Unless the brain works on quantum mechanical principles, (which seems
unlikely) and some of those 30 megabytes are instructions for
constructing a quantum computer then modern hardware is probably
adequate for a AI seed. Of course I don't know what those 30 megabytes
are so I have no idea how to actually build the damn thing.
