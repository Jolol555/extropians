If you're planning to upgrade to Windows '98, watch out for this "feature"!

<p>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/03/biztech/articles/07soft.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/03/biztech/articles/07soft.html</a></i><br>

<i>&gt; Microsoft to Alter Software in Response to Privacy Concerns</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; By JOHN MARKOFF</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; SAN FRANCISCO -- The Microsoft Corporation moved to defuse a potentially</i><br>
<i>&gt; explosive privacy issue today, saying it would modify a feature of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; Windows 98 operating system that has been quietly used to create a vast</i><br>
<i>&gt; data base of personal information about computer users.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft conceded that the feature, a unique identifying number used by</i><br>
<i>&gt; Windows and other Microsoft products, had the potential to be far more</i><br>
<i>&gt; invasive than a traceable serial number in the Intel Corporation's new</i><br>
&gt; Pentium III that has privacy advocates up in arms. The difference is that<br>
&gt; the Windows number is tied to an individual's name, to identifying<br>
numbers
<br>
<i>&gt; on the hardware in his computer and even to documents that he creates.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&gt; The combination of the Windows number with all these data, the company<br>
&gt; said, could result in the ability to track a single user and the<br>
documents
<br>
<i>&gt; he created across vast computer networks. Hackers could compromise the</i><br>
<i>&gt; resulting data base, or subpoenas might allow authorities to gain access</i><br>
<i>&gt; to information that would otherwise remain private and unavailable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Privacy advocates fear that availability will lead to abuses.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "We're definitely sensitive to any privacy concerns," Robert Bennett,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft's group product manager for Windows, said.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "The software was not supposed to send this information unless the</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer user checked a specific option."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Mr. Bennett said the option to collect the information had been added to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the software so that Microsoft support employees would be able to help</i><br>
<i>&gt; users diagnose problems with their computers more accurately. He said the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Redmond, Wash., software giant had never intended to use the data for</i><br>
<i>&gt; marketing purposes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In response to a complaint from a software programmer in Massachusetts,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft will not only alter the way the registration program works in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the next maintenance release of Windows 98, Mr. Bennett said. He said</i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft technicians would look through the company's data bases and</i><br>
<i>&gt; expunge information that had been improperly collected as a result of</i><br>
<i>&gt; earlier versions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&gt; The company is also exploring the possibility of creating a free utility<br>
&gt; program that would make it possible for Windows users to delete the<br>
serial
<br>
<i>&gt; number information from a small data base in the part of Windows system</i><br>
<i>&gt; known as the registry, where it is now collected.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft has been discussing the issue with a Cambridge, Mass.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; programmer who contacted the company earlier this week after discovering</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the Microsoft Office business software was creating unique numbers</i><br>
<i>&gt; identifying a user's personal computer and embedding them in spreadsheet</i><br>
<i>&gt; and word processing documents.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&gt; The programmer, Robert M. Smith, who is the president of Phar Lap<br>
Software
<br>
<i>&gt; Inc., a software tools development company, told the company that he</i><br>
<i>&gt; believed the practice created a potential threat to privacy. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&gt; Microsoft officials said earlier this week that the numbers generated by<br>
&gt; the company's software were part of an effort to keep different<br>
components
<br>
<i>&gt; from interfering with each other in an increasingly complex world of</i><br>
<i>&gt; networked computers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, Mr. Smith said that the number, in effect, created a "digital</i><br>
<i>&gt; fingerprint" that could be used to match a document created by a word</i><br>
<i>&gt; processing or spreadsheet program with a particular computer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&gt; On Thursday, after further studying the "registration wizard" -- the<br>
&gt; software module that enables customers to register their copies of<br>
Windows
<br>
<i>&gt; 98 operating system for support and updates -- Mr. Smith discovered that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the number, known as a Globally Unique Identifier, was being transmitted</i><br>
<i>&gt; to Microsoft as part of a list of registration information that generally</i><br>
<i>&gt; includes the owner's name, address, phone number and other demographic</i><br>
<i>&gt; information as well as details about the hardware and software on or</i><br>
<i>&gt; attached to the user's computer.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Microsoft never asked me if it was O.K. to send in this number, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; never said it was being sent," Mr. Smith said. "They are apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt; building a data base that relates Ethernet adapter addresses to personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; information."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&gt; Ethernet adapters are cards inserted in a personal computer that enable<br>
it
<br>
&gt; to connect to high-speed networks within organizations and through them<br>
to
<br>
<i>&gt; the Internet. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&gt; The controversy erupted just weeks after Intel, maker of the most widely<br>
&gt; used processors for machines that use the Windows operating system,<br>
agreed
<br>
<i>&gt; to make it possible for computer manufacturers to set its new Pentium III</i><br>
<i>&gt; computer chip so that a serial number on the chip would not be recorded</i><br>
<i>&gt; without the computer user's permission.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Privacy activists have been attacking both companies, arguing that</i><br>
&gt; identification numbers can be easily misused to create electronic<br>
&gt; monitoring systems. Such systems could track a computer user's behavior<br>
in
<br>
<i>&gt; cyberspace or create dossiers of personal information about individuals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The issue has sparked a heated debate over the fundamental technology of</i><br>
<i>&gt; modern computer networks and software systems, which routinely employ</i><br>
<i>&gt; serial numbers to identify individual computers and software modules,</i><br>
<i>&gt; known as "objects," that can be shared by a number of programs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But the Intel number only identified a computer. The Windows number</i><br>
<i>&gt; identifies a person. And because the Windows number created a potential</i><br>
<i>&gt; linkage between individuals and confidential documents they created,</i><br>
<i>&gt; privacy advocates said they were outraged.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "I think this is horrendous," said Jason Catlett, president of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Junkbusters, a consumer privacy organization based in Greenbrook, N.J. </i><br>
<i>&gt; "They're tattooing a number into each file. Think of the implications. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; some whistle blower sends a file, it can be traced back to the person</i><br>
<i>&gt; himself. It's an extremely dangerous feature. Why did they do it?"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Privacy groups have long warned about the dangers of centralized</i><br>
<i>&gt; information and of monitoring electronic behavior. The groups have been</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussing the implications of the serial number on the Pentium III with</i><br>
<i>&gt; Intel, and while some privacy advocates acknowledge that the number can</i><br>
<i>&gt; play an important role in protecting both privacy and security, others</i><br>
<i>&gt; have called for a boycott of Intel, arguing that the likelihood of misuse</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the number outweighs its benefits.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Beyond the fear of a centralized Big Brother, they add that the rise of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Internet has made it possible for individual companies to freely use</i><br>
<i>&gt; detailed personal information for commercial ends.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "The problem is the absence of legal rules that limit the collection and</i><br>
<i>&gt; use of personal information," said Marc Rotenberg, director of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
&gt; "It's clear to me that large Internet companies such as Microsoft, AOL<br>
and
<br>
<i>&gt; Netscape will try to squeeze out privacy."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Microsoft executives said on Friday evening that they had developed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; feature for technical reasons related to the need to distinguish between</i><br>
<i>&gt; millions of different hardware and software objects on the Internet. They</i><br>
<i>&gt; said they had never considered the privacy implications.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; According to Microsoft software engineers, the roots of the company's</i><br>
<i>&gt; numbering system go back to a system developed by computer researchers at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Open Software Foundation in Cambridge in the early 1990's.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In an effort to develop technology that would enable computer systems to</i><br>
&gt; communicate across a network, a numbering system known as a Universally<br>
&gt; Unique Identifier, or UUID, was established as part of a software<br>
standard
<br>
<i>&gt; known as the Distributed Computing Environment, or DCE.  Microsoft relied</i><br>
<i>&gt; on this standard when it developed a remote computing capability for</i><br>
<i>&gt; Windows known as Object Linking and Embedding, or OLE.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The company's designers changed UUID to GUID, for Globally Unique</i><br>
<i>&gt; Identifier, and that term is now widely used by software applications.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, the GUID is used in setting "cookies" -- files that World</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wide Web sites send to a visitor's hard drive to identify the user later</i><br>
<i>&gt; and to track his or her travels through the Web. </i><br>
