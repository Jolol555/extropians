Today's AWAD  (possessive case)

<p>
;)

<p>
apostrophe (uh-POS-truh-fee) noun

<p>
The superscript sign (') used to indicate the omission of a letter
or letters from a word, the possessive case, and the plurals of
numbers, letters, and abbreviations.

<p>
[French, from Late Latin apostrophus, from Greek apostrophos, from<br>
apostrephein, to turn away : apo-, + strephein, to turn.]

<p>
apostrophe (uh-POS-truh-fee) noun

<p>
The direct address of an absent or imaginary person or of a
personified abstraction, especially as a digression in the course
of a speech or composition.

<p>
[Late Latin apostrophe, from Greek, from apostrephein, to turn<br>
away.]
 
<p>
"`It seems that no one is certain anymore where to put an
apostrophe,' he says. `I call this syndrome apostrophobia.'
Apostrophes (which are airborne commas) are used to indicate the
omission of a letter or letters from a word or phrase ..."

   Patricia Corrigan, Punctuation Falls on Very Hard Time's, St.
Louis Post-Dispatch, 30 Sep 1995.

<p>
"As an aside, it is interesting to consider a meteorological
apostrophe delivered by one of the attendants as Cleopatra prepares
to place the serpent on her breast: Dissolve, thick cloud, and
rain, that I may say The gods themselves do weep."

   McIntosh, William A., The serpent that bites its own tail: a
quattrocento birth-death-rebirth dialectic., Parabola, 1 Nov 1998.
 
<p>
This week's theme: words about punctuation and diacritics.

<p>
Well, we goofed. What can I say, even we make mistakes. (-;
In yesterday's posting the apostrophe was punctuation non grata.
Thanks to all 39571 who wrote to point it out.             -Anu
