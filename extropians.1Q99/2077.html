This is where I become quite confused and I think that we better stop
trying to take the transhumanism out of extropy where it originated.
Transhumanism is open for discussion and new ideas -- the point of extropy
is continuous growth and understanding.  Anyone who thinks extropy is
carved in cement is mistaken.  Anyone who thinks that there are spiritual
or political differences might rethink her or his premise.  Some have
spiritual preferences, some not. Some have political preferences, some not.
 The IMPORTANT thing to consider is how we approach transhumanism, not
anyone's sacred cow.

<p>
The transhuman list Alex generated is not especially for "transhumanism,"
however, the extropy list is.  Transhuman means the evolution from human to
posthuman.  Transhuman is a philosophical approach to our transhumanity.

<p>
If one would like to be on a transhumanism select list, then join
participate in the Extropians select where transhumanism should be
discussed  (life extension, intelligence increase, psychological
improvement, etc.).

<p>
Now, let's continue progressing.
