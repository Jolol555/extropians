<a href="2649.html#2662qlink1">&gt; My next door neighbor, a wonderful good hearted women</a><br>
<i>&gt; in her 80s is dying a difficult death.  Her husband of over 50 years (a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; friend and great neighbor) is suffering horribly.  Their grown children are</i><br>
<i>&gt; wondering about aimlessly.  I feel deeply for them.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2649.html#2662qlink2">&gt; I feel a need to visit, offer to help, and talk and listen with them, I mean</a><br>
<i>&gt; frankly discuss what's going on, offer concern and even reassurance.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2649.html#2662qlink3">&gt; What would a brave young atheist say and do?</a><br>

<p>
This one? They are your good friends. Help them however they want to be
helped. Offer to mow the lawn or do some other service of value to them.
Have a cup of tea together. Let them talk to you. Tell the what great
neighbors they have been.

<p>
<a name="2675qlink1">Be extraverted and calm - that generates happiness. Talk about happy</a> news
like the roton rocket or that News guy's new book about how their generation
built America. Be yourself. Be kind.

<p>
Look after yourself,
