<i>&gt; &gt; Exactly. Freedom means the right to be stupid. Only by giving all the right</i><br>

<i>&gt; Nice words, but other people's stupidities, especially in the religious/</i><br>

<i>&gt; such is *stupid people*.</i><br>

<p>
Thats what the prophets of encouraged evolution are for: Mr. Colt, Mr. Remington,
Mr. Winchester, Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson, and Mr. Ruger.</a> Stupidity is frequently a
capital crime.

<i>&gt; &gt; parents and children, most people recognise that children are in fact</i><br>

Everyone is born stupid. Not all remain so.</a> Most figure out that you can't be
<a name="2463qlink4">stupid and get along in the modern world.... Those that don't either die or remain
in their little niches where their actual influence on the world is miniscule,
rare, and inconsequential.</a>

<p>
<a name="2463qlink5">The real work is not in forcing people to raise their children in cookie cutter
politically correct lifestyles, but in teaching adults to critically think for
</a>themselves.<a name="2463qlink6"> That is a problem that is not the fault of the student, but of the
teacher. Well, teacher, what have you got to say for yourself?
