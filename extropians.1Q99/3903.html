Checked your serotonin levels recently, Michael? :-)

Seriously, I think this is a bit rude. You have a point - when joining
a new forum it is a good idea to read up on what has gone before - but
it is clearly impractical to read everything (especially with a forum
with this list's long history) and also likely that you will miss one
thing or another. The best way of learning things is often to ask. And
we oldtimers should remember that many of the discussions we have seen
again and again and again are new to many participants - they form an
important part of learning about our meme-complex, and we should
really try to participate (even if it might feel tiresome to deal with
the identity question, the singularity argument, the libertarian
general quarrel and all the others again).
