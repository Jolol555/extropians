             UF Researcher Finds Way To Slow The Aging
             Process

             GAINESVILLE, Fla. --- Contrary to what
             Juan Ponce de Leon thought when he searched
             for it in the 16th century, the fountain of youth
             is made of anti-oxidants, not water, and it's a
             lot easier to find than the famed explorer
             thought. 

             In a study published in this month's American
             Journal of Physiology, Christiaan
             Leeuwenburgh, a professor in the University of
             Florida's College of Health and Human
             Performance, found that anti-oxidant
             intervention, which can come from taking
             vitamin supplements or from a steady routine of
             exercise, slows parts of the aging process. 

<br>
             "Our most significant finding was that<br>
             anti-oxidant intervention slows down basal
             skeletal muscle oxidation, which causes the
             body to age," said Leeuwenburgh, who did the
             study with Jay Heinecke, John Holloszy and
             Polly Hansen of the Washington University
             School of Medicine. "This is the first evidence
             of this." 

             Regular exercise or a diet including plenty of
             anti-oxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C and
             beta carotene, all of which fight the tendency of
             oxygen to slowly break down muscle mass,
             might protect against the type of tissue and
             muscle loss that occur as individuals grow
             older, Leeuwenburgh said. 

<br>
             "When an individual grows old, we all know<br>
             that the person loses a lot of muscle mass,"
             Leeuwenburgh said. "One of the mechanisms
             that causes this is increased oxidant
             production, in a process known as muscle
             oxidation. Regular exercise or anti-oxidant
             supplements could potentially improve and
             protect against this oxidative stress, which may
             have direct implications on tissue loss and the
             aging process." 

             Leeuwenburgh divided rats into two groups,
             one of which was given an anti-oxidant diet of
             beta carotene and vitamins E and C. After 21
             months, the rate of muscle oxidation for the
             rats in the anti-oxidant groups was 50 percent
             lower than the rate for the rats in the control
             group. Some of the rats that were not fed
             anti-oxidants were exercised regularly, and
             they, too, showed a decrease in muscle
             oxidation. 

<br>
             "We were surprised to see that regular exercise<br>
             training was about as effective in reducing
             levels of oxidation as a diet of anti-oxidants,"
             Leeuwenburgh said. "The combined effect of
             anti-oxidants and exercise, however, didn't
             cause a significantly lower level of muscle
             oxidation, which was interesting." 

             The study also was the first of its kind to show
             that levels of oxidation in the body can be
             determined noninvasively, by using specific
             markers in the urine. This will allow people to
             measure their levels of muscle oxidation more
             quickly and easily. 

<br>
             "People are talking a lot about oxidative stress<br>
             these days, but we didn't previously have a way
             to measure it noninvasively," said Heinecke, a
             professor in the department of internal
             medicine at Washington University in St. Louis
             and one of Leeuwenburgh's partners in the
             study. "It's nice to be able to measure this
             without going inside the body." 

             The marker found in the urine also may be
             useful as an indicator of other medical
             problems, which will contribute not only to
             slowing the aging process but also to protecting
             people against various diseases. 

<br>
             "This marker could be useful in assessing a<br>
             variety of conditions, like Alzheimers,
             atherosclerosis, cancer and the aging process
             itself," Leeuwenburgh said. "They've all been
             associated with increased free-radical
             formation, which can be detected in the urine." 

             A previous study by Leeuwenburgh also
             showed that a decrease in caloric intake, which
             can lead to a longer life span because of a
             reduction in the body's rate of metabolism, also
             causes a similar decrease in skeletal muscle
             oxidation. 

             Leeuwenburgh recommends an increase of
             daily anti-oxidant intake, especially in the form
             of vitamin E, because it also has been proven to
             protect against heart disease. In addition, he
             says that exercising more and eating less --
             both of which have been promoted for years as
             ways to stay healthy in everyday life -- also
             will increase the human life span and help
             people stay younger longer. 

<br>
             "A big problem in society is that we're not<br>
             active enough, and things like fast food
             contribute to an almost toxic lifestyle," he said.
<br>
             "If we could increase our daily activities and be<br>
             more conscious of what we eat, we'll come a
             long way."
