<p>
Especially fascinating and rewarding is Jim Schnabel's wonderful new book
FOREVER YOUNG: SCIENCE AND THE SEARCH FOR IMMORTALITY, London: Bloomsbury,
1998.  The first half is an enthralling New Yorker-style essay on the
embattled quests by Drs Jim Rogers and Pat McGreer, and eventually Dennis
Selkoe (who might get a Nobel for this work, I guess), in tracking down the
ways in which beta amyloids do their dirty work.  

<p>
Jim Schnabel wrote several absolutely delightful earlier books about fields
at the margins of science and lunacy, which are carefully not cited
anywhere in the PR for this latest one, notably DARK WHITE about UFO
abduction claims and REMOTE VIEWERS about military and CIA experiments in
psi/spying. 

<p>
He also wrote an early New Scientist paper (19 June 1993, pp. 22-6) on
Rogers' theory that Alzheimers' is basically a result of massive
auto-immune inflammation of the brain, an `arthritis of the brain', which
might be halted by judicious use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
and eventually by a targeted drug like those that in the lab inhibit the
injurious cleaving of the precursor APP to yield beta amyloid. 

<p>
Two such drugs start human clinical trials this year in Athena and Lilly
labs.  `If everything goes well,' writes Schnabel, `larger-scale trials
will start [2000].  And, let's hope, a drug to prevent amyloid accumulation
- and thus, perhaps, Alzheimer's disease - will be available at pharmacies
around 2004' (p. 79).

<p>
No cause for despair in all this!
