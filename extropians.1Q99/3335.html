<p>
	ha. ill outlive you if u die at all, man. and yes, i intend to prove it,
though i doubt youll be around to witness...
<p>
	and your "everybody dies" is far from a certainty; the only way it can be a
certainty is if everybody really dies, in which case u wont be around to say
"i was right." 
<p>
	in case nobody every told you, fallible humans made the "laws" of
thermodynamics (and many other "laws") in an attempt to give process to what
they percieve.  in that sense, u (by ascribing some ethreal kind of absolute
certainty to em) did make the laws... 
<p>
	u seem assume that there is no backdoor.  well, we found a way to cheat
gravity, and u would call that a law, right? people are always thinking about
new ways to lie, cheat, steal, and otherwise get around these things we call
(because we dont know how to get around em yet) laws.  if there is a way to
successfully pull this particular little coup off, i intend to take full
advantage of it.
<p>
	in the words of terry pratchet in _small gods_:  "i think what we presently
call laws are best rather called... guidelines." 

<p>
"yes i know my enemy / there the teachers who taught me to fight me /
compromise / conformity / assimilation / submission / salvation / ignorance /
hypocracy / brutality / the elite / all of which are american dreams / ALL OF
WHICH ARE AMERICAN DREAMS" -- rage against the machine "know your enemy"
