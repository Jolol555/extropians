<a name="3035qlink2">I think you'll find that glaciers in the northern hemisphere</a> are receding,
<a name="3035qlink3">and glaciers in the southern hemisphere are growing. I don't have a cite,
but that's certainly true of the only glaciers I've visited</a> (in New Zealand

until the middle of this century and have been growing again since then.

<p>
However, that depends on what your definition of "seems" is. My experience
</a>
<a name="3035qlink5">has been the opposite; I haven't seen a summer worthy of the name since I
came back to England two years ago, and nothing that even begins</a> to compare

<p>
I'd be interested to see an independent study of recent temperatures; all
that I've seen implies that the pro-greenhouse folks declare each year to
be warmer than ever before even when they're not. In fact they seem to
declare any kind of weather as proof of global warming, whether it's hot,
cold, perfectly clear or a major storm.
