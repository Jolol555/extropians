Call for Conference Proposals

<p>
BODYMIND: HOLISTIC EXPLORATIONS OF COGNITION, ACTION, AND INTERACTION 
IN
<br>
EDUCATION
<br>
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada
<br>
May 1, 1999

<p>
Keynote Speakers: David Jardine and David Abram
Modernist views of knowledge that separate mind and body, thought and 
experience, self and other, human and nature, have in recent years 
been challenged by holistic and embodied schools of thought across 
areas as diverse as phenomenology, performance studies, the cognitive 
sciences, narrative, feminist theories, deep ecology, cultural 
studies, Buddhism, and queer theory. This conference will explore the 
implications of such scholarship for education.<a name="1947qlink1"> What kinds of 
frameworks will help educators to conceptualize and embody</a> the 
languaging announced by holistic and enactivist understandings of 
cognition? How do views of knowledge as dynamic and enactive shift the 
roles and responsibilities of those engaged with teaching, learning, 
teacher education, curriculum, and educational research?
Our keynote presenters were chosen with these questions in mind. David 
Abram is an ecophilosopher and author of  The Spell of the Sensuous 
<br>
(Vintage).   David Jardine is Associate Professor of Education at the <br>
University of  Calgary and the author of "To dwell with a boundless 
heart": Essays in curriculum, hermeneutics and the ecological 
imagination (Peter Lang).
<br>
Conference organizers welcome discussion of works-in-progress and 
other research projects from graduate students, faculty and others 
interested in the conference theme.  Interdisciplinary, provocative 
and creative inquiries/ presentations that integrate and critique 
educational theory and practice are encouraged. The conference format 
will be similar to that of a colloquium: presenters will be encouraged 
to share their work in a safe, collaborative, and interactive 
environment.
<br>
Details regarding proposal submissions follow. Please note that 
registration information and fees will be mailed at a later date. 
 Suggestions for accommodations in Vancouver will also be sent to 
presenters upon request.
