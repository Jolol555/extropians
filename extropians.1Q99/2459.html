I agree.  I've been playing around with the filters for a while now, and
I've basically eliminated all of those 'Y2K' messages, as well as 'Gun
Control' and 'Information is on the Bottom'.  Not everyone would want that.
 If we've all got different tastes, than 2 lists (for example) won't help
the problem.  We would, in essence, need as many lists as we do members.

<p>
If nothing else, do what I did when my filters weren't working:  delete
messages by subject.
