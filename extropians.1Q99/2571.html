<a name="2581qlink1">They were operating on the 'rare loose nut' theory; that if enough people accessed and perused their site, they would occasionally push the rare loose nut who found them over the edge into assassination.  It is incitement to murder and dissemination of enabling info. to facilitate that purpose, pure and simple.  It's a semiotically and memetically programmed implausibly deniable cyber-doctor-killing module.</a>
