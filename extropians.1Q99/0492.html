  IAN: But that argument fails to observe 
  the fact that there's a difference between 
  a chair and an animal... owning a self-owner,
  a sentient being, is not the same as owning 
  a chair. An animal is inherently a self-owner
  because it claims to own its body; apart from
  existing, a chair or table make no such claim.

<p>
  The fact that sawing the leg off a chair and 
  sawing the leg off a live dog would be drastically
   different events (one being neutral and 
  one being a sight of horror and pain) is just
  the measure that animals are not the same kind
  of property as inanimate objects. "Caretaker" 
  is the proper context of the animal "owner."
