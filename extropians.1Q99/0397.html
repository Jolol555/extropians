We are obviously talking on a species by species basis. Moreover the only human
beings that I am aware of who cannot communicate on a consistent basis at a
minimally acceptable level are in a coma, are severely autistic or in the last
stages of Alzheimers. Almost all of these people will, at some point in their
lives, be able to state their personhood, even the autistic individual, given
the proper treatment. The intelligence of man at his most degraded level is
still far above that of any animal, excepting the complete vegetable. Sure,
some animals can be trained, but fery few learn anything on their own, and
extremely few remember what they learn.
