Sort of.  I think the kind of SI we were talking about is going to go so
far, so fast, that it isn't going to bother with anything as mundane as
large-scale nanotech.  The actually options I listed are just suggestive - I
expect a real runaway SI is going to come up with something much better.

&gt; I don't think this works. If the SI is concerned with time, it surely<br>

<p>
The sun isn't massive enough to form a neutron star.  Their isn't enough
mass in the entire solar system to make one.  In more general terms, if high
energy levels (in a cosmological sense) are required to build an SI's dream
home, there probably isn't enough mass/energy in the solar system to support
the project.

<i>&gt; enroute.</i><br>

<p>
If we assume that the SI has no morals, that there is no possible way of
building what the SI wants without creating extreme conditions (in a
cosmological sense), that there is no possible way of migrating to another
location that would be faster than sublight spaceflight, that taking large
amounts of mass along would actually make the trip more pleasant, and that
the SI intends to actually experience the trip (rather than just switching
to a waiting state for the duration), then yes, that might happen.

<p>
I think all of those assumptions are questionable, some of them highly so.

<p>
<a href="3854.html#3884qlink5">&gt; FTL travel and customized universes require new physics.</a><br>

<p>
Given that we currently know that our best theories of physics are
incomplete, I think it is unrealistic in the extreme to expect that an SI
will not discover new physical effects that it can exploit.  There is no way
to know what those discoveries will be, of course, but we must expect that
they will happen.

<p>
I would not predict that an SI would discover any one particular
'impossible' technology.  However, I feel safe in predicting that it will
find ways of doing many things we would consider impossible.
