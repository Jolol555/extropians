Actually, the answer might be as simple as putting good smelling flowers
to cover the bad smelling dead body.

<a name="2623qlink2">Buring the tools with the dead also might have a simple explanation.
The default mode was to keep a person's possessions with the person.  It
would be natural to keep their tools with the dead body.  It would take
a higher level of reasoning to decide that they didn't need the tools
anymore.  We shouldn't question why tools were buried with the dead, as
if this were an exceptional thing to do.  I think this would have been
the normal procedure, and the custom of not burying the tools with the
dead became the new exception later</a> on.
