<a name="0497qlink3">Consider the analogy of altitude.  Just because people have long had control

that they have absolute rights to the space hundreds or thousands</a> of kilometers
<a name="0497qlink4">above and below the ground?  By the same argument you make against spectrum 
rights granted by the FCC it would seem you should complain that the FAA 
granted airplanes the right to fly high above ground</a> properties

<p>
<a name="0497qlink6">I'm not sure what you mean by "establish."   Would you object if people 
who owned property of the form you approve of wanted to contract to redivide 
their property, creating "property" in spectrum in the process?</a>  Hal
had a recent post where he elaborated this sort of scenario.  Would you 
seek to prevent the enforcement of such contracts?  If not, you would seem
to accept the concept of this sort of property, and we're just back the 
question of whether we got to that point without someone stealing something
from someone else.
