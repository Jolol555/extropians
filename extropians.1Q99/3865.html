<p>
Good.  With that cleared up, let us proceed.  {8^D

<a name="3902qlink1"><a href="3825.html#3865qlink1">&gt; But as you say, NASA or whatever relevant parties, do not cater to</a><br>
<i>&gt; training crippled</i><br>
<i>&gt; women for space...</a></i><br>

<p>
<a name="3902qlink2">NASA must change.  I suspect we will hafta go around NASA to get
anything really creative done.  They *must* be conservative because
they are NASA and they hafta deal with public relations.  A Mars
colony requires thinking outside the box.  And, let us not sell NASA
too short: some wacky ideas may start to grow on them.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; And as I said previously, I assume that with the</i><br>
<a href="3825.html#3865qlink2">&gt; advancement of technology, in that time, we will have other</a><br>
<i>&gt; alternatives.(nanotech etc.)</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3886qlink1">Yes, with nanotech, all this becomes easy.  But we can do a
Mars colony now.  I say lets go!</a>

<p>
<a href="3825.html#3865qlink3">&gt; I suppose there was a sensation in your previous emails as the the worth</a><br>
<i>&gt; of a person that was prevalent, and therefor disturbing.</i><br>

<p>
Yes I suspect many folks would find it disturbing to send a "disabled"
person to pave the way.  My argument is that for certain tasks,
they are not disabled at all, they are abled.

<p>
<a href="3825.html#3865qlink4">&gt; ...that I am a "small woman, who has had a car wreck that</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3902qlink3">owwww.  {8-[  Sorry to hear that.  Glad you are back on your feet.</a>  {8-]
<a name="3902qlink4">Would a bigger car have helped?  (Very extropian)</a>

<p>
<a href="3825.html#3865qlink5">&gt; ...There may be some, I in fact I am so nuts, I would</a><br>
<i>&gt; most likely do so...</i><br>

<p>
Yes and recall that this is a biiig planet with a looot of people.  I
suspect we could find a most satisfactory and willing adventurer.

<p>
<a href="3825.html#3865qlink6">&gt; words like, "pathetic or wouldn't miss much anyways" that was in your</a><br>
<i>&gt; emails, that left a bad taste in my mouth....</i><br>

<p>
oops sorry.  I did not mean to imply that this girl I spoke of does not
<a name="3902qlink5">love life as much as you and I do.  She does, I can assure</a> you.

<p>
<a name="3902qlink6">As for wouldnt miss much, this might be a key point.
Our current track star astronauts might go crazy cooped
up in a farm capsule for... ever.  There are humans</a> that are preadapted
to this kind of existence: those who are bound to their homes for health
reasons.  My spina biffida example: she would not miss running around
in a field of tall grass, shes never been able to do that.  She would not
miss sex, this being out of the question for her.  She would not miss
quaffing a thick steak, shes a vegetarian.  She can entertain herself
for indefinite periods of time with a computer, as she has done for
her whole life and could continue to do on the long trip to Mars.

<p>
<a name="3902qlink7"><a name="3886qlink2">I did realize there was a weakness in my previous arguement: that
the spina bifida victim could take a number of frozen embryos to
self implant if things go well.</a>  In the example I gave, her pelvis is
not a whole lot bigger now than it was when she was born.  I am
not at all sure that her womb is functional, or if so, how the pelvis
could be modified to allow both self implantation of a frozen embryo
and childbirth without help.

<p>
Perhaps someone who is up on current medical technology could
help me out here: could an undeveloped vagina be surgically modified
into a workable birth canal assuming all voluntary muscles below the
sternum are nonfunctional?  Could the pelvis be split into two parts
</a>
for instance and connected by a releasable device?  I understand nature
provides a cartilage in the female pelvis that comes unglued during the
birth process.  Could the medics invent something that mimics this process?

<p>
If all these heroic measures are taken in order to reduce the crew
size to one very small very brave person, the total payload requirements
reduce to quite manageable masses.  spike
