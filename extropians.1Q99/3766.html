Whole-body hormonal adrenal events are predicted to require up to
several minutes and that turns out to be correct too.

<a name="3780qlink2"><a name="3779qlink2">"Failed to find evidence of fraud" is an *extremely* charitable</a> way
of putting</a></a> it.  Randi switched some of the bottles without telling
Beneviste.  The bottles that *had* been treated - but that Beneviste
thought hadn't - showed no reaction.  The bottles that *had not* 
been treated - but that Beneviste thought had - had a reaction!
Clearly the effect was quite bogus, and that's certainly evidence
for fraud.  Fraud wasn't *proved*, because Beneviste could be a 
wishful incompetent.
