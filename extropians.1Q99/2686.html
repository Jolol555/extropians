<p>
Do you mean to imply that non-transhumanists do not have this emotional and
memetic baggage?

<p>
While some of us may have adverse reactions to the use of "God" in this
context, most of us can understand your intention. I fear that some members
of the "general public" may not think to or care to make such a distinction.

<p>
I trust that it is not your intention to be decietful, but you may be
inadvertantly heading in that direction. I suspect that you would feel that
not using "God" would remove force from your argument, but perhaps that is
exactly what it needs.
