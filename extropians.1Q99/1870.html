<a name="1874qlink1">I'd written,

<p>
<a href="1859.html#1870qlink1">&gt;&gt; Again, the question as regards infringement (though not dilution) is</a><br>
whether
<br>
<a href="1859.html#1870qlink2">&gt;&gt; or not the use is likely to confuse consumers as to the source, origin, or</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; affiliation of ExI.  Some uses of "Extropian"--even by huge, for-profit</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; corporations--may not go that far.  Consider, for example, "Not Extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Cremation, Inc."</i><br>

<p>
By way, I suppose, of counterexample, Mike Lorrey wrote:

<p>
<i>&gt;[The owner of internic.com] has succeeded in court to force internic.com</i><br>
<i>&gt;to put a disclaimer</i><br>
<a href="1859.html#1870qlink3">&gt;on every one of its pages that Network Associates, internic.net, and the US</a><br>
Gov't
<br>
<a href="1859.html#1870qlink4">&gt;are not affiliated with internic.com.</a><br>

<p>
But, of course, those two parties were in exactly the same line of business.
Consumer confusion really did look likely.  The MacDonald's examples to which
Mike later alluded better prove his point, I think, that aggressive trademark
holders can push the fuzzy boundaries of consumer confusion a long way.  As
Mike says,

<p>
<a href="1859.html#1870qlink5">&gt;It tends to be a matter of who has the most money.</a></a><br>

<p>
Mike adds an important but not dispositive element to the analysis:

<p>
<a href="1859.html#1870qlink6">&gt;In general though, it is the intent to which the name is used which</a><br>
<i>&gt;decides the acceptability of its use. Using</i><br>
<i>&gt;a name for a purpose which overlaps that of the original trade name owner is</i><br>
<i>&gt;definitely treading on thin ice. </i><br>

<p>
I'd massage that point to say that intent *can* prove very important but that
it does not alone resolve the question of infringement.  Courts use a multfactor
 test, only one element of which considers intent.  Innocent parties can
be held liable for duplicating non-distinctive marks.  Contrarywise, even
parties who intentionally duplicate an existing mark can be found to have put
it to a non-infringing use.  (Again, I caution that I am not here addressing
dilution.)

<p>
<a href="1859.html#1870qlink7">&gt;Given that ExI is, shall we say, not the most</a><br>
<i>&gt;well endowed think tank, someone could probably start a company called</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian Holistic Nose Pickers, Inc. and not give a fig about what ExI</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinks or says about it, since it seems like they probably can't afford</i><br>
<i>&gt;to contest it in court.</i><br>

<p>
In theory, a contigency-fee attorney might take ExI's case.  A party suffering
infringement can recover damages, the defendant's unjust profits, costs of the
action, and, in extreme cases, treble damages and attorney's fees.
