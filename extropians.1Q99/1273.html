	My friends, I find myself moving toward a career change. Since my
early teens I've wanted to become a research scientist working on the
problem of human aging. Money and social status were never the main
motivators for me-- all I ever cared about was this goal. I sacrificed
much for it.

<p>
<a name="1303qlink1">	Now at 25 I'm coming to grips with the fact that I've blown eight
years in undergrad, with nothing to show for it but a mediocre GPA and a
long string of failures wherever hands-on labwork was involved. I'm not
giving up on my goal, but perhaps it's time to change my approach.</a>

<p>
<a name="1281qlink1"><a name="1278qlink1"><a name="1275qlink1">	So, if not as a scientist, then how else do you think an
individual can further the cause of researching a way to slow or reverse
the aging process? What do you think the field of biological gerontology
needs most from laymen sympathizers?</a> Or, are there any alternative paths
to serious research that don't depend heavily on school transcripts and
recommendations from professors? If you were me, what would you do?
</a>
</a>

<p>
	I am asking you because you are among the few groups of people
whose opinions I respect, and I thank you if you choose to respond.
