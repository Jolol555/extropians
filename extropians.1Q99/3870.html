But - something that has struck me a bit - (because I've often thought of
freeing children in schooling) is that children don't know what their
options are - another good thing is that they don't know their limits - but
sometimes there are opposites and grey areas to this. For instance, some
children have heaps of limits and do know a few of their options. Anyway,
basically the adults and teachers (they should morph into ONE group) should
do two things: Facilitate and allow. Allow the children to be the active
part in their own education and facilitate them by ensuring that they are
not "blocked" and are free in every way and at the same time given all the
resources and knowledge about the subject that they can.</a>
