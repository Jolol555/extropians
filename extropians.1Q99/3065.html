0. Every non-interjection verbal term used by humans refer to something.

<p>
   That ``something'' exists as:
<pre>
	(a)	a phenomenon in the real world,
	(b)	a set of signal data in brains of sentients,
	(c)	both of the above,
   or	(d)	none of the above

</pre>
<p>
   An interjection term would e.g. "Ouch!" or other non- or quasi-verbal
   communication (e.g. the words which U.S. TV companies convert into &lt;beep&gt;
   would be quasi-verbal communication).
   

<OL>
  <li>  When I first read the passage above I thought the term "qualia" referred to
   the property of objects in (b) being characterized as e.g. ``being red''.


</OL>
<p>
   But after reading the passage again, it appears to me that the ``qualia''
   term actually refers to the set of properties in (a), the basic input data
   of the human brain.

<p>
   The qualia ``red'' would then consist of the frequencies which would cause
   a human to call the perceived colour "red" when sensed by the human.

<p>
   Correctly understood?

<p>
2. The qualia of any rational interpretation would then refer to the output
<p>
   from the rational thinking part of the human brains, as perceived by the
   internal (non-verbal) monitor.

<p>
   Do you feel certain that this actually has the same immediate quality as
   the qualia of external input has?  Apart from introspection, do you have
   any data that suggest that the human brain implements the verbal symbol
   manipulation on qualia?  If not, would not the verbal symbol manipulation
   actually _be_ the qualia of the verbal part of brain?

<p>
   Consider the fact that by naming various parts of one's mental processes
   one achieve power over them in metaprogramming (cf. the magickal idea of
   getting power over something or somebody when you know the true name).

<p>
<a href="2897.html#3065qlink2">|It's an interesting question as to whether or not you can doubt that you</a><br>
<i>|are right now experiencing the sensation of redness.  Some people</i><br>
<i>|would say no.  I would say yes. </i><br>

<p>
If the "experiencing" refers to the (a) domain the answer becomes "No." unless
I receive optical input signals from the outside world of the correct
frequencies.

<p>
If the "experiencing" refers to the (b) domain the answer becomes "No." if
I evoke the symbol complex "red", "Yes." if do not and &lt;shrug&gt; if I disable
the brain unit which I use to convert sense data into verbal data as the
word "red" would lose its meaning for me.
