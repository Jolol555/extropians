Good points, Robin. And, if you don't mind, I'll take that as a cue for
this...

TESTING THE SPECIES CONCEPT:
<br>
Technology's Impact on the Evolutionary Classification of Humanity's
Descendents

Abstract
<br>
The species concept is central to modern evolutionary biology. Most biologists
and philosophers of biology have decisively settled on the particular concept
of a species as a protected gene pool. While borderline cases do arise in
applying the concept, mostly it has worked well for the biological world up
until now. This paper examines how well the biological species concept can
handle some possible future developments among Homo sapiens. These changes,
being driven by the interface of biology and technology, raise boundary
problems unprecedented in evolutionary history. I argue that the current
species concept can handle some of these possibilities, but runs into serious
difficulties in classifying the results of imaginable technological
modifications of the human species. The paper suggests a range of responses to
extend or supplement the protected gene pool species concept.
