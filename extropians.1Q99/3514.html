It's not the tissue that's dead, although after time, would deteriorate, 
but the nervouse systems currents of electical synapsis.
These thoughts (Jeff pondered), I believe to relevent to cryonics, in 
the sense that there may be some question as to how much of a memory can 
be rejuvinated. If I was climbing up in years, without the advances of 
technology on my side, and had to consider cryonics, I would. But it 
would be unfortunate if I didn't come back with all memory in tact.

<a href="3513.html#3514qlink1">&gt;From: Jeff Davis </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Friends,</i><br>
<i>&gt;	I'm cross-posting this to the cryonet and extropians list.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;	I've been thinking lately about brain damage.  When exactly is </i><br>
identity
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink2">&gt;destroyed?  I mean really obliterated?</a><br>
<i>&gt;	Specifically, I'm wondering about the difference between loss of</i><br>
<i>&gt;information, and loss of ACCESS TO information.  This last attributed </i><br>
to
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink3">&gt;the loss of higher-order function.</a><br>
<i>&gt;	When a brain is damaged--I'm thinking here of strokes, traumatic </i><br>
injury,
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink4">&gt;brain tumors, and  alzheimer's--certain structural changes take place.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Think of the spatial distribution of the damage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;	Some of those changes presumably involve actual cell death.  But how </i><br>
many
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink5">&gt;cells die, what fraction of the whole is that, how is the damage</a><br>
<i>&gt;distributed regionally/topologically, and what happens to the dead cell</i><br>
<i>&gt;bodies? (I assume fully necrotic cells undergo apoptosis and "digest"</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves, the by-products being dispersed for either local or distant</i><br>
<i>&gt;consumption or disposal.)  What of "scar tissue" and other structural</i><br>
<i>&gt;remnants?</i><br>
<i>&gt;	 Then too, what degree of brain damage is characterized by cell damage</i><br>
<i>&gt;without cell death--membrane or cytoskeletal damage/alteration; </i><br>
organelle
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink6">&gt;damage/reduced function--such that the cell still lives, but is not </a><br>
capable
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink7">&gt;of supporting the coordinated global activity characteristic of normal</a><br>
<i>&gt;brain function?(Does this happen, or am I describing a non-fact?   I </i><br>
recall
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink8">&gt;that mitochondria sometimes suffer gradual degradation from, at least,</a><br>
<i>&gt;inherited defect.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;	When a person is brain dead, is there actually a great lump of dead </i><br>
tissue
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink9">&gt;inside the skull (I don't think so), or does the absence of brain</a><br>
<i>&gt;waves--the flatline on the electroencephalograph that provokes the term</i><br>
<i>&gt;"persistant vegetative state"--only suffice to imply loss of global</i><br>
<i>&gt;function, but not large-scale cell death, maybe not even small-scale </i><br>
cell
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink10">&gt;death,  or (here's the crux)maybe not nearly as much information loss </a><br>
as
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink11">&gt;we're inclined to think? </a><br>
<i>&gt;	 To what extent is the topology of damage responsible for disruptions </i><br>
of
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink12">&gt;neuronal firing patterns?  Could the loss of memory or personality be </a><br>
due
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink13">&gt;not to the loss of the information, but to the inability of the organ </a><br>
to
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink14">&gt;fire that pattern, due to a disrupted firing path.  Would the </a><br>
accumulation
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink15">&gt;of many small areas of damage, such as in the case of alzheimer's, so </a><br>
"damp
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink16">&gt;out" the spatially dynamic, electrochemical resonance of thought--of </a><br>
memory
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink17">&gt;and personality EXPRESSION--that the person seems to fade away?  In a</a><br>
<i>&gt;man-made electronic system, a simple broken wire can result in a </i><br>
complete
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink18">&gt;system failure even though the actual structural deficit may be only an</a><br>
<i>&gt;infinitesimally small fraction of all the atoms of the system, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;information deficit zero. </i><br>
<i>&gt;	Are dementia et al victims really as far gone as we fear they are when </i><br>
we
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink19">&gt;view with dismay their varying degrees of vegetative-ness?  Or is the</a><br>
<i>&gt;information there, but just not expressible? </i><br>
<i>&gt;	Identity survival is central to cryonics.  Some aspects of the </i><br>
(gradual)
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink20">&gt;process of identity deterioration provoke an interpretation of </a><br>
irreversible
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink21">&gt;loss.  We look at them and say "They're gone."  How valid is this?  How</a><br>
<i>&gt;subject to reevaluation?</i><br>
<i>&gt;	One final detail.  I'm a strong believer in the "elegant design" of</i><br>
<i>&gt;natural systems.  "Nature" squeezes as many uses out of any system</i><br>
<i>&gt;component as she can. (Please excuse the teleological and </i><br>
anthropomorphic
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink22">&gt;modes of expression.)  Thus a local brain region with a specialized</a><br>
<i>&gt;function is likely to have multiple roles.  In larger scale global</i><br>
<i>&gt;function--like memory or personality pattern storage and expression--it </i><br>
may
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink23">&gt;have a supporting but not a critical role.  Thus limited local damage </a><br>
which
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink24">&gt;may cause striking loss of specific function may, as regards memory or</a><br>
<i>&gt;personality, have only a mild impact.  In fact, let me repeat what has </i><br>
been
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink25">&gt;suggested before: that memory and personality may be broadly </a><br>
distributed
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink26">&gt;across the cortex and cerebellum (and elswhere?), that such distributed</a><br>
<i>&gt;expression is arguably inherently robust, and that these features </i><br>
strongly
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink27">&gt;suggest the importance of memory and personality to the individual and </a><br>
the
<br>
<a href="3484.html#3514qlink28">&gt;species (not to mention to cryonicists and extropians).</a><br>
