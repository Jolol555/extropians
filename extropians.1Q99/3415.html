<a name="3423qlink1">I would recommend that your mother tries nicotine chewing gum. In 
contrast to the "suicide pins", chewing gum is extremely safe while 
having a similar neurological effect.</a>

<p>
<a name="3423qlink2">There is some evidence that nicotine improves performance on complex 
cognitive tasks (also in non-smokers).</a> I decided to give the chewing 
gum a try a few months back. Judging from the pharmacist's reaction 
it is somewhat unusual that people who have never smoked a 
cigarette buy this product. I use 2mg gums, seldom more than two per 
day, and I have not noticed any addiction. I think it has some 
nootropic effects: it seems to make it somewhat easier to concentrate 
and to get into "the flow". The first few times, the actual chewing 
created a distraction that approximately cancelled this effect, but 
as the chewing becomes habitual this distraction disappears.

<p>
Anybody else who has experimented with nicotine as a smart drug?
