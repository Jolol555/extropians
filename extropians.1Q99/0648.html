international law is citizenship conferred on an individual according to the
nation in which the individual was conceived in. They all make birth the
condition of citizenship. Thus the unborn have no rights under any accepted
national or international convention. Here in the US, under the 9th and 10th
amendments, any rights not specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights were to

<a name="0713qlink3">So here, the various states can pass laws or state constitutional amendments
which regulate abortion and remain entirely constitutional on all levels. It is
their right to do so, and the right of people in the states to put such
amendments up to state referendums.</a>

the rights of the mother, then so</a> be it.
