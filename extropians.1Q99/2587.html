Just got this off of Yahoo News.  Is this too kooky for the list?  Is
this of interest to Extropians?  I think it's pretty damned
interesting... :)

LONDON (Reuters) - Hackers have seized control of one of Britain's
military communication satellites and issued blackmail threats, The
Sunday Business newspaper reported.</a>

<p>
The newspaper, quoting security sources, said the intruders altered
the course of one of Britain's four satellites that are used by
defense planners and military forces around the world.

<p>
The sources said the satellite's course was changed just over two
weeks ago. The hackers then issued a blackmail threat, demanding money
to stop interfering with the satellite.

<p>
``This is a nightmare scenario,'' said one intelligence source.<br>
Military strategists said that if Britain were to come under nuclear
attack, an aggressor would first interfere with military
communications systems.

<p>
``This is not just a case of computer nerds mucking about. This is<br>
very, very serious and the blackmail threat has made it even more
serious,'' one security source said.

<p>
Police said they would not comment as the investigation was at too
sensitive a stage. The Ministry of Defense made no comment.
