I've noticed and complained about this failing too.  And science fiction 
author' areas of expertize are an important proximate cause.  But that 
expertize choice is itself no coincidence.  I think the deeper cause is
the fact that the public will defer to a remarkable extent to claims of 
physicists, and the public is extremely unwilling to defer to economists.
Other academic areas fall in between these extremes.

<a name="3241qlink1">Physicists can declare the universe has eleven dimensions, based on the 
slimmest of evidence, and media coverage basically says "isn't that cool."
Economists can say price limits probably reduce the supply of an item like
labor, standard economic wisdom for centuries, and if the media mentions
it at all it is described as controversial, being sure to quote disagreeing 
</a>experts.  And this is no more the fault of the media than the SF pattern 
you describe is the fault of SF authors. 

<p>
SF readers mostly swallow an SF description of an encounter with a black 
hole, complaining perhaps if this slows down the plot or if it disagrees 
with expert descriptions of such an encounter.<a name="3232qlink1">  Story descriptions of an
encounter with a price limit are less vivid, and so more likely to slow
a plot down.</a>  More important, an SF description of an economic effect of 
a similar level of speculation would be met with far more reader 
skepticism.  The author would have to put a lot more work in to justify 
its plausibility to readers.
