<a name="3777qlink1">To whom it may concern:

<p>
An individual calling him/herself Belgybayeva Aliya Mikhitovna using the ID
# 909847 sent an unsolicited e-mail to our mailing list,
</a>
extropians@extropy.com

<p>
His message follows:

People, here is an opportunity:

<p>
Possible Stock IPO

<p>
Monsterbook.com, a US company is promising to give away free
shares of its stock when it goes public to anyone who signs up to receive
a free internet directory -- similar to what Yahoo did at its beginning.
And Yahoo's stock has really skyrocketed.

<p>
Go to the following web address  and use my referral No. #909847
when you sign up.  Once you sign up you will get your own number and for
every person you get to sign up, you will receive a share or $10 in
compensation.

<p>
Hurry, they are making this offer to the first one million people who
sign up and when I went it today, it was already over 100,000.

MonsterBook.com, and you understand you may be subject to fines and/or
imprisonment for disobeying laws or rules of certain network providers or
jurisdictions regarding the use of 'SPAM' messages. The only acceptable
methods of referring someone to MonsterBook.com are sending e-mail to a

If you send unsolicited e-mails or postings, MonsterBook.com will be
notified, and you will immediately lose your subscription to the

Thank you for your attention to this violation and your efforts to curb the
use of spam.
