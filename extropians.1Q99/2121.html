<p>
Yes this is true in regards to the party alignment, and it is relevant to me.

<p>

<p>
Yes, this is true about libertarians and the Libertarian party.  Thanks for
making this distinction.

<p>
<a href="2117.html#2121qlink3">&gt;Now.  </a><br>
<i>&gt;Given that libertarianism is the belief that force should not be used</i><br>
<i>&gt;except in self-defense, do you believe that the term is no longer</i><br>
<i>&gt;compatible with "extropy"?  If so, why has this changed (since </i><br>
<i>&gt;*someone* put this into the extropy memeset)?</i><br>

<p>
Libertarianism is a political philosophy emphasizing the rights of the
individual and its doctrine  stresses the right to self-ownership and, by
extension, the right to private ownership of material resources and
property. Most oppose any form of taxation and was espoused by  anarchists
in the 19th century. 

<p>
In 1970s Libertarianism reappeared in U.S. political thinking representing
individual liberty in light a bulging government entering in all aspects of
life. The party was founded in the U.S. in 1972 and "candidates have run
for political office, including the presidency, in all 50 states, but it
has not won enough adherents to be a major political force."

<p>
Now:  Rights of the individual is extropian.  Taxes happen, and although I
oppose them I'd rather pay than go to jail.  Also, I do not mind paying
some of my taxes.  Growing government control is an issue that Americans
need to deal with in the best ways possible.  The Libertarian Party does
not get enough votes to swing any major political force.  There are other
alternatives that I would like to be involved with.  

<p>
I think Milton Friedman's talk at the Cato Conference a few months ago was
an important reminder of the too much government control.  "In my view,
reducing the scope of government is our most important single objective."
(Friedman)

<p>
Do I think that force should only be used in self-defense?  Do you mean
would I push my views on someone against their will?  No.  Do I think
government should push its views on me against my will?  No.
