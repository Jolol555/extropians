Abstract
<br>
  Previously we demonstrated that low grade chronic metabolic acidosis exists
  normally in humans eating ordinary diets that yield normal net rates of
  endogenous acid production (EAP), and that the degree of acidosis increases
  with age. We hypothesize that such diet-dependent and age-amplifying low
  grade metabolic acidosis contributes to the decline in skeletal muscle mass
  that occurs normally with aging. This hypothesis is based on the reported
  finding that chronic metabolic acidosis induces muscle protein breakdown, and
  that correction of acidosis reverses the effect. Accordingly, in 14 healthy
  postmenopausal women residing in a General Clinical Research Center and
  eating a constant diet yielding a normal EAP rate, we tested whether
  correcting their "physiological" acidosis with orally administered
  potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3; 60-120
<br>
  mmol/day for 18 days) reduces their urinary nitrogen loss. KHCO3 reduced EAP
  to nearly zero, significantly reduced the blood hydrogen ion concentration (P
  &lt; 0.001), and increased the plasma bicarbonate concentration
  (P &lt; 0.001), indicating that pre-KHCO3, diet-dependent EAP was significantly
  perturbing systemic acid-base equilibrium, causing a low grade metabolic
  acidosis. Urinary ammonia nitrogen, urea nitrogen, and total nitrogen levels
  significantly decreased. The cumulative reduction in nitrogen excretion was
  14.1 +/- 12.3 g (P &lt; 0.001). Renal creatinine clearance and urine volume
  remained unchanged. We conclude that in postmenopausal women, neutralization
  of diet-induced EAP with KHCO3 corrects their preexisting diet-dependent low
  grade metabolic acidosis and significantly reduces their urinary nitrogen
  wasting. The magnitude of the KHCO3-induced nitrogen-sparing effect is
  potentially sufficient to both prevent continuing age-related loss of muscle
  mass and restore previously accrued deficits.

Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND. In normal subjects, a low level of metabolic acidosis and
  positive acid balance (the production of more acid than is excreted) are
  typically present and correlate in degree with the amount of endogenous acid
  produced by the metabolism of foods in ordinary diets abundant in protein.
  Over a lifetime, the counteraction of retained endogenous acid by base
  mobilized from the skeleton may contribute to the decrease in bone mass that
  occurs normally with aging. METHODS. To test that possibility, we
  administered potassium bicarbonate to 18
  postmenopausal women who were given a constant diet (652 mg [16 mmol] of
  calcium and 96 g of protein per 60 kg of body weight). The
  potassium bicarbonate was given orally for
  18 days in doses (60 to 120 mmol per day) that nearly completely neutralized
  the endogenous acid. RESULTS. During the administration of
  potassium bicarbonate, the calcium and
  phosphorus balance became less negative or more positive--that is, less was
  excreted in comparison with the amount ingested (mean [+/- SD] change in
  calcium balance, +56 +/- 76 mg [1.4 +/- 1.9 mmol] per day per 60 kg; P =
  0.009; change in phosphorus balance, +47 +/- 64 mg [1.5 +/- 2.1 mmol] per day
  per 60 kg; P = 0.007) because of reductions in urinary calcium and phosphorus
  excretion. The changes in calcium and phosphorus balance were positively
  correlated (P &lt; 0.001). Serum osteocalcin concentrations increased from 5.5
  +/- 2.8 to 6.1 +/- 2.8 ng per milliliter (P &lt; 0.001), and urinary
  hydroxyproline excretion decreased from 28.9 +/- 12.3 to 26.7 +/- 10.8 mg per
  day (220 +/- 94 to 204 +/- 82 mumol per day; P = 0.05). Net renal acid
  excretion decreased from 70.9 +/- 10.1 to 12.8 +/- 21.8 mmol per day,
  indicating nearly complete neutralization of endogenous acid. CONCLUSIONS. In
  postmenopausal women, the oral administration of potassium
  bicarbonate at a dose sufficient to neutralize endogenous
  acid improves calcium and phosphorus balance, reduces bone resorption, and
  increases the rate of bone formation.

  Potassium preserves endothelial function and enhances aortic

Abstract
<br>
  It has recently been proposed that in rat models of genetic hypertension,
  supplemental dietary potassium preserves release of
  endothelium-derived relaxing factor independently of its capacity to either
  attenuate hypertension or increase plasma potassium. To test
  this hypothesis in Dahl salt-sensitive rats given sodium chloride (4%) for 3
  weeks, we supplemented dietary potassium (2.1%) with either
  KCl (n = 16) or KHCO3 (n = 16). Compared with unsupplemented rats (n = 16),
  rats supplemented with either potassium salt had a lower
  mean arterial pressure and a greater release of endothelium-derived relaxing
  factor, as assessed from acetylcholine-induced relaxation of precontracted
  aortic rings. However, the maximum relaxation response to acetylcholine
  correlated inversely with blood pressure (r = -.82, P &lt; .001), not only in
  the KCl (r = -.68, P &lt; .002) and KHCO3 (r = -.77, P &lt; .001) groups but also
  in unsupplemented rats (r = -.86, P &lt; .001). With potassium
  supplementation, plasma potassium concentrations measured
  between 4 and 6 PM did not increase, but those measured between 4 and 6 AM
  did increase (P &lt; .05). In isolated ring segments, aortic compliance was
  greater in both the KCl and KHCO3 groups than in unsupplemented rats (0.015
  and 0.017 vs 0.009 mm2/mm Hg) (P &lt; .01). This greater compliance could not be
  related to differences in blood pressure, plasma potassium,
  or collagen or elastin content of the aortic wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250
