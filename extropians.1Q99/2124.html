<p>
Well, I think he is wrong to draw this conclusion.  Just because I say that
I do not align myself with a libertarianism does not mean that I believe in
force.

<p>
No.

<p>
<i>&gt;To make this concrete, is it transhuman </i><br>
<a href="2120.html#2124qlink3">&gt;to have freedom of choice about paying taxes?</a><br>

<p>
Transhuman is an evolution from human to posthuman.  I think what you mean
is rather: is it transhumanist to have freedom of choice about paying taxes?

<p>
This is a political question and I don't have a freedom about not paying
taxes in the country I live in at this particular time.

<p>
<a href="2120.html#2124qlink4">&gt;Libertarianism is not a party anymore than republicans "are" capitalism. </a><br>
<i>&gt;Parties are at best imperfect instantiations of a philosophy.</i><br>

<p>
I was referring to the Libertarian Party.
