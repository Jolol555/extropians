Iceland: Parliament Sells Rights to Genetic Code

<pre>

<p>
    By John Schwartz
<br>
    Washington Post Staff Writer
<br>
    January 12, 1999=20

<p>
    Iceland has decided to become the first country in the world to sell =
the rights to the entire population's genetic code to a biotechnology =
company -- a move that is highlighting the promise and risks of the =
genetic information age.=20

<p>
    The strikingly uniform DNA of Iceland's largely blue-eyed, =
blond-haired populace is expected to provide an invaluable resource for =
studying human genetics, leading to fundamental insights into many =
diseases, proponents say.=20

<p>
    "It really is a complete paradigm shift in medicine," said Jonathan =
Knowles, who heads research at Roche Holding Ltd., which has signed a =
$200 million, five-year deal to develop new drugs and tests from the =
data.=20

<p>
    But the plan is highly controversial because it will pool richly =
detailed genetic, medical and genealogical information about Iceland's =
270,000 residents into a set of linked databases that companies will =
search for clues into the nature of disease. Although a majority of =
Iceland's citizens support the plan, a vocal minority of scientists and =
doctors -- with support from a worldwide network of like-minded privacy =
advocates -- have stoked the controversy.=20

<p>
    "Most doctors and scientists here in Iceland are in favor of the =
basic purpose of this project -- but find the proposed solution quite =
unethical and unrealistic," said Jon Erlendsson, a Reykjavik-based =
engineer and writer who believes the database network will eventually =
fail because doctors and patients will refuse to cooperate once its =
nature is better understood.=20

<p>
    Opponents fear the database could make the most private details of =
individuals' lives public. People with mental illness or other health =
problems could be stigmatized, perhaps suffering job discrimination. =
Patients may become less willing to divulge personal information to =
their doctors. And in a country where some estimates say that about 10 =
percent of the population may have been born out of wedlock, long-held =
family secrets could leak out.=20

<p>
    The fight in Iceland is focusing attention on the potential risks of =
efforts to mine and refine personal data -- efforts that are also =
increasingly common in the United States and around the world.=20

<p>
    "Turning the population into electronic guinea pigs" should serve as =
a warning to Americans, said David Banisar of the Washington-based =
Electronic Privacy Information Center.=20

<p>
    Despite the objections, Iceland could begin collecting blood to =
obtain the DNA samples within six months, after a period in which =
citizens may decline to participate. Precisely how the blood will be =
collected has not been determined.=20

<p>
    The plan was proposed by Kari Stefansson, a Harvard-educated =
Icelandic scientist, in part as a way to develop a new natural resource =
for a country where unemployment is a chronic problem. Iceland's =
parliament, the Althing, approved the plan last month, passing a law =
authorizing the database and creating the framework that will enable a =
local company, deCODE Genetics, to hold an unusual 12-year monopoly on =
data marketing rights.=20

<p>
    Iceland's population presents a tantalizing opportunity for those =
who study genetics because all of that blond hair and blue eyes reflects =
one of the most remarkably homogeneous populations in the world. The =
original blend of 9th century Norse stock and Celtic seamen has been =
largely unchanged, and that gene pool was further restricted by bouts of =
plague, famine and volcanic eruption.=20

<p>
    This comparatively simple set of genes makes genetic prospecting far =
less daunting than attempting to track down faulty genes among the =
millions of chemical components arrayed along the human chromosomes in =
heterogeneous populations like that of the United States.=20

<p>
    (It's a little like trying to detect a single flat note sung by one =
person while wandering through a public park in which everyone is =
singing his own favorite tune: The distractions of the merengue, the =
klezmer, the classical and the sea chanteys make it even harder to find =
the errant note. A homogeneous population such as Iceland's, however, is =
more like a chorus, with most people singing from the same page -- so =
it's much easier to discern when one of the singers is off.)=20

<p>
    Because Iceland has a strong health care system with extensive =
record-keeping, as well as genealogical records that go back hundreds of =
years, it offers tremendous potential for ferreting out the relationship =
between the genetic and environmental origins of disease, said =
Stefansson. Researchers will be able to sift through the data to uncover =
medical insights "in a systematic manner," Stefansson said, adding that =
<br>
"it's going to be a great discovery tool."=20<br>

<p>
    Those in Iceland supporting the plan say it strikes a careful =
balance between the rights of the citizenry and the needs of science. =
The unified health database will "improve delivery of health services. . =
. . On balance, I think the potential advantages will outweigh the risks =
involved," said Solveig Petursdottir, a member of parliament who voted =
for it.=20

<p>
    Opponents of the law cite numerous problems. Many of them are among =
the nation's leading scientists and scholars. They argue their case in =
Icelandic and English on their Web site, and have formed an advocacy =
group, Mannvernd, "to promote ethical standards in medical research, =
science and in the biotechnology industry in Iceland" and to oppose the =
new law, which the group's Web site says "infringes upon accepted =
medical, scientific and commercial standards." They say that they =
understand the importance of deCode's work and support earlier efforts =
by the company to understand genetic diseases by studying the DNA of =
Icelandic volunteers. But the new plan, they say, takes away too much =
privacy -- for private gain -- and gives too little back to the nation =
and to science.=20

<p>
    "When you put genealogical information into the databank and also =
genetic data, then the databank knows more about you than you know about =
yourself," said Tomas Zoega, chairman of the Icelandic Medical =
Association's ethics council. "Some look at it as a fantastic idea. But =
I think the idea is a scary one."=20

<p>
    Opponents complain that they still have not been told how the DNA =
will be collected, or how much information will be stored in the =
database. Those details will be decided by a government-created =
committee.=20

<p>
    The company has promised to collect the data "anonymously" but uses =
that word with great nuance, opponents say. Among most database experts, =
<br>
"anonymous" almost always means that identifying information will be =<br>
stripped away. But in this case, the information directly identifying =
individuals will be encrypted so that it cannot easily be read by =
unauthorized people.=20

<p>
    British researcher Ross Anderson has prepared a paper for the =
Icelandic Medical Association that questions the notion that anonymity =
can be protected when so much data is collected. The company has pledged =
to program the computers to produce no fewer than 10 records for any =
query so that the computers can never identify an individual.=20

<p>
    But multiple searches can winnow one name out of 10, Anderson said, =
adding that no encryption scheme can mask identities when so much =
personal information is stored in one place.=20

<p>
    Opponents also argue that the pay-as-you-go research concept damages =
the spirit of science, in which knowledge should be freely shared.=20

<p>
    Most important from a doctor's point of view, Zoega said, is the =
possibility that "trust between patients and physicians will diminish =
and maybe disappear" if people believe that every fact about them will =
be entered into the database.=20

<p>
    As for those who support it, "I think that those are the people who =
have not been ill, who do not have medical records lying about," said =
Petur Hauksson, a psychiatrist who chairs the Icelandic Psychiatric =
Patients Association.=20

<p>
    Opposition to the database law is, if anything, even stronger =
outside of Iceland. Privacy officials of the European Union have been =
sharply critical of the database proposal. Researchers with expertise in =
genetics and public policy said that the nation's scientific goal is =
laudable but that the plan is flawed.=20

<p>
    Simon Davies, head of the London-based Privacy International, said =
the trend toward the collection of more data at the expense of privacy =
is a worldwide problem. "A sensible civil libertarian will say the =
democratic process failed us. It's all just evaporated in the past five =
years."=20

<p>
    Davies said people are too quick to accede to arguments based on =
<br>
"economic rationalism" without thinking about the broader implications. =<br>
"Thin-lipped accountants have taken control," he said.=20<br>

<p>
    Iceland has gone further than other European nations, Davies said, =
but it will not be alone for long. "What we're seeing in Iceland is just =
the forerunner of a Europe-wide mechanism," Davies said. "Wherever you =
see a bad law, you can bet that the rest of Europe will sink to that =
level and integrate."=20

<p>
    Pharmaceutical scientist Knowles acknowledged the potential for =
abuse. "We must do everything possible to ensure that privacy of =
individuals is maintained," he said. Because the data will be used to =
look for statistical relationships in large populations, the company has =
no motivation to examine information about specific persons, he said. =
<br>
"Individual data is of no use whatsoever."=20<br>

<p>
    Fears of abuse should be addressed through legislation, not by =
restricting the project, Stefansson said. "We should not let the bad =
guys dictate" public policy, he said. "We're not going to let people die =
simply because it might be abused.=20

<p>
    "You do not place limitations on the creation of new knowledge," he =
said, "you place limitations on the ways that the new knowledge can be =
used."=20
