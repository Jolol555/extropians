<p>
<a href="2088.html#2114qlink1">&gt;Before a major new drug can come on the market a company</a><br>
<i>&gt;must shell out close to a billion dollars to pay for the research and </i><br>
<i>&gt;development.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2160qlink1">The enormous bulk of this cost is for regulatory compliance and marketing 
Dithc the regulations and hte cost</a> is minimal and many more companies 
will enter the market.

<p>
<a name="2174qlink6"><a name="2160qlink2">In a non-patent &amp; non-FDA world, without having carried out product 
safety tests for themselves, any generic rip-offs would expose themselves 
to product liability. This is not true now as FDA approval for the 
</a>
</a>
originator protects the post-patent generics.<a name="2160qlink3"> Get rid of the FDA and the 
</a>
barrier to generics would raise substantially.

<p>
<a href="2088.html#2114qlink2">&gt;If they didn't have patent protection for at least a few years after that</a><br>
<i>&gt;they could never recover their investment,  </i><br>
<i>&gt;other companies would crank out dirt cheap  generic versions by the ton. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="2174qlink10">Well, many of us might argue that cheap drugs by the tonne is a good 
</a>thing. 

<p>
<a name="2174qlink4">Critically, you ignore the power of branding. If what you say was 
correct, Philip Morris would not be the 100 billion dollar company which 
it is. Nor would Coca Cola.</a> Neither have a patent on their commodity. 
Plus, the sword cuts both ways, the company can market its competitor's 
products (after it does its own risk research).

<p>
<a href="2088.html#2114qlink3">&gt;Only a fool would develop a new drug, as a stockholder I would </a><br>
<i>&gt;sell my stock in any drug company that was so stupid as to spend any money at </i><br>
all on
<br>
<i>&gt;research. </i><br>

<p>
I don't think you would, anymore than you would sell your shares in Cisco 
because they do research but never use patents aggressively.

<p>
The Cisco chair simply believes that patents are not the way to do 
business.

<p>
cheerio,
