Actually, both of you and I have quite a bit in common. However, I'm 21 and
I have a good GPA. Still, the problem of how to pursue a career in
biogerontology is common to both -- I don't know about Paul -- of us. My
advice is that you study aging and become good at it. No-one is going to
teach you how to end human aging; you'll have to try and figure it out
yourself. There is much work that can be done without necessarily working
in a lab. Einstein began by having a mediocre job -- with patents if I'm
not mistaken -- but having enough free time to dedicate to his personal
theoretical research. Remember: "Discovery consists of seeing what
everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought." Alternatively, as
other people have mentioned, you can try to make a lot of money and then
pay someone to do the research for you.

<p>
Personally, I graduate in June and I'm going the "transcripts and
recommendation letters" path. I don't think I can gather enough funds to
start my own company but I'll contact a couple of companies working in
biogerontology. Needless to say that if any of you have any good ideas,
give a signal.

<p>
Goodbye and good luck.
