I suspect that will be true to at least some extent, simply because people
are likely to want to live near others with similar beliefs... and because
PPAs are likely to charge a lot more for people who choose to live near to
those who support very different legal systems, as that will greatly increase
their enforcement costs.

<p>
They're very similar, but I don't see that the government system is at
all realistic: I can't see any government choosing to let people secede,
because no governor likes to lose their power. Plus in the anarcho-capitalist
society I'd at least have the choice of staying where I was and paying
the extra cost for a different PPA if I so chose.
