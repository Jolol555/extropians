<p>
What follows is the longest text I've ever posted to this list.  I
promise to make it a rare occasion to post BASICS: text of this
length.  

<p>
<a name="3359qlink1">My confused office mate, who recently "gave up country music" at the
advice of his pastor, forwarded this tid bit in an effort to finally
help me see the light.  My other office mate is a "sports
genius"....he he.  My untrained eye was able to pick up about 8
fallacies that I don't think I could properly annotate.  Is there
someone more competent on this list who could properly annotate the
fallacies or at least someone who knows of a net based atheist
resource that might be able to help.  Where is Jeff Dee when you need
him?</a>

<p>
 "LET ME EXPLAIN THE problem science has with Jesus Christ."  The<br>
atheist
<br>
 professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of
his new
<br>
 students to stand. "You're a Christian, aren't you, son?"
<br>
<i> "Yes, sir."</i><br>
<i> "So you believe in God?"</i><br>
<i> "Absolutely."</i><br>
<i> "Is God good?"</i><br>
<i> "Sure!  God's good."</i><br>
<i> "Is God all-powerful?  Can God do anything?"</i><br>
 "Yes." "Are you good or evil?"<br>
 "The Bible says I'm evil."<br>
<br>
 The professor grins knowingly. "Ahh! THE BIBLE!"  He considers for a
 moment.
<br>
 "Here's one for you.  Let's say there's a sick person over here and you<br>
 can cure him.  You can do it.  Would you help them? Would you try?"
<br>
<i> "Yes sir, I would."</i><br>
<i> "So you're good...!"</i><br>
 "I wouldn't say that."<br>
 "Why not say that?  You would help a sick and maimed person if you<br>
 could...in fact most of us would if we could... God doesn't."

<p>
 No answer.
<br>
 "He doesn't, does he?  My brother was a Christian who died of cancer<br>
even
<br>
 though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good?  Hmmm?
Can
<br>
 you answer that one?"
<br>
 No answer.
<br>
 The elderly man is sympathetic. "No, you can't, can you?"
 He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student
time
<br>
 to relax.  In philosophy, you have to go easy with the new ones.

<p>
<i> "Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?"</i><br>
<i> "Er... Yes."</i><br>
<i> "Is Satan good?"</i><br>
<i> "No."</i><br>
 "Where does Satan come from?"<br>
<br>
 The student falters.
<br>
 "From... God..."<br>
 "That's right. God made Satan, didn't he?"<br>

<p>
 The elderly man runs his bony fingers through his thinning hair and
turns
<br>
 to the smirking, student audience.

<p>
 "I think we're going to have a lot of fun this semester, ladies and<br>
 gentlemen."

<p>
 He turns back to the Christian.
<br>
<i> "Tell me, son.  Is there evil in this world?"</i><br>
<i> "Yes, sir."</i><br>
<i> "Evil's everywhere, isn't it?  Did God make everything?"</i><br>
 "Yes."<br>
 "Who created evil?"<br>
<br>
 No answer.
<br>
 "Is there sickness in this world? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All the<br>
 terrible things - do they exist in this world?"
 The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."
<br>
 "Who created them?"<br>
<br>
 No answer.
<br>
 The professor suddenly shouts at his student. "WHO CREATED THEM? TELL
ME,
<br>
 PLEASE!"
<br>
 The professor closes in for the kill and climbs into the Christian's
 face. In a still small voice: "God created all evil, didn't He, son?"

<p>
 No answer. The student tries to hold the steady, experienced gaze and
 fails.

<p>
 Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace the front of the classroom
like
<br>
 an aging panther. The class is mesmerized.

<p>
 "Tell me," he continues, "How is it that this God is good if He created<br>
 all evil throughout all time?"  The professor swishes his arms around
to
<br>
 encompass the wickedness of the world.  "All the hatred, the brutality,
 all the pain, all the torture, all the death and ugliness and all the
 suffering created by this good God is all over the world, isn't it,
young
<br>
 man?"

<p>
 No answer.
<br>
 "Don't you see it all over the place? Huh?" Pause. "Don't you?"<br>
 The professor leans into the student's face again and whispers, "Is God
 good?"

<p>
 No answer.
<br>
 "Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?"<br>
<br>
 The student's voice betrays him and cracks. "Yes, professor.  I do."
 The old man shakes his head sadly. "Science says you have five senses
you
<br>
 use to identify and observe the world around you.  Have you ever seen
 your Jesus?"

<p>
<i> "No, sir.  I've never seen Him."</i><br>
<i> "Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"</i><br>
 "No, sir. I have not."<br>
 "Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your<br>
 Jesus...in fact, do you have any sensory perception of your God
 whatsoever?"

<p>
 No answer.
<br>
<i> "Answer me, please."</i><br>
<i> "No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."</i><br>
<i> "You're AFRAID... you haven't?"</i><br>
<i> "No, sir."</i><br>
<i> "Yet you still believe in him?"</i><br>
 "...yes..."<br>
 "That takes FAITH!"  The professor smiles sagely at the underling.<br>

<p>
 "According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol,<br>
 science says your God doesn't exist.  What do you say to that, son?
Where
<br>
 is your God now?"

<p>
 The student doesn't answer.
<br>
 "Sit down, please."<br>

<p>
 The Christian sits...Defeated. Another Christian raises his hand.
<br>
 "Professor, may I address the class?"<br>
<br>
 The professor turns and smiles. "Ah, another Christian in the vanguard!
 Come, come, young man. Speak some proper wisdom to the gathering."

<p>
 The Christian looks around the room.  "Some interesting points you are
 making, sir.  Now I've got a question for you. Is there such thing as
 heat?"
<br>
<i> "Yes," the professor replies.  "There's heat."</i><br>
<i> "Is there such a thing as cold?"</i><br>
 "Yes, son, there's cold too."<br>
 "No, sir, there isn't."<br>

<p>
 The professor's grin freezes. The room suddenly goes very cold.
 The second Christian continues. "You can have lots of heat, even more
 heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat but
we
<br>
 don't
<br>
 have anything called 'cold'.  We can hit 458 degrees below zero,
which is
<br>
 no heat, but we can't go any further after that.  "There is no such
thing
<br>
 as
<br>
 cold, otherwise we would be able to go colder than 458 - You see, sir,
 cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot
 measure
<br>
 cold.  Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. 
Cold
<br>
 is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it."

<p>
 Silence. A pin drops somewhere in the classroom.
<br>
 "Is there such a thing as darkness, professor?"<br>
 "That's a dumb question, son. What is night if it isn't darkness? What<br>
 are you getting at...?"
<br>
<i> "So you say there is such a thing as darkness?"</i><br>
 "Yes..."<br>
 "You're wrong again, sir.  Darkness is not something, it is the absence<br>
 of something.  You can have low light, normal light, bright light,
 flashing
<br>
 light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's
 called darkness, isn't it?  That's the meaning we use to define the
word.
<br>
 In
<br>
 reality, Darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness
 darker and give me a jar of it. Can you...give me a jar of darker
 darkness,
<br>
 professor?"

<p>
 Despite himself, the professor smiles at the young effrontery before
him.
<br>
 This will indeed be a good semester.
<br>
 "Would you mind telling us what your point is, young man?"<br>
 "Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to<br>
 start with and so your conclusion must be in error...."

<p>
 The professor goes toxic.  "Flawed...?  How dare you...!"
<br>
 "Sir, may I explain what I mean?"<br>
<br>
 The class is all ears.
<br>
 "Explain... oh, explain..." The professor makes an admirable effort to<br>
 regain control.  Suddenly he is affability itself.  He waves his hand
to
<br>
 silence the class, for the student to continue.

<p>
 "You are working on the premise of duality," the Christian explains.<br>
 "That, for example, there is life and then there's death; a good God<br>
and
<br>
 a bad
<br>
 God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite,
something we
<br>
 can
<br>
 measure. Sir, science cannot even explain a thought.  It uses
electricity
<br>
 and magnetism but has never seen, much less fully understood them. To
 view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that
 death
<br>
 cannot exist as a substantive thing.  Death is not the opposite of
life,
<br>
 merely the absence of it."

<p>
 The young man holds up a newspaper he takes from the desk of a neighbor
 who has been reading it. "Here is one of the most disgusting tabloids
 this
<br>
 country hosts, professor. Is there such a thing as immorality?"

<p>
 "Of course there is, now look..."<br>
 "Wrong again, sir.  You see, immorality is merely the absence of<br>
 morality. Is there such thing as injustice?  No. Injustice is the
absence
<br>
 of
<br>
 justice. Is there such a thing as evil?"  The Christian pauses. "Isn't
 evil the
<br>
 absence of good?"

<p>
 The professor's face has turned an alarming color. He is so angry he is
 temporarily speechless.

<p>
 The Christian continues. "If there is evil in the world, professor, and
 we all agree there is, then God, if he exists, must be accomplishing a
 work
<br>
 through the agency of evil. What is that work, God is accomplishing?
The
<br>
 Bible tells us it is to see if each one of us will, of our own free
will,
<br>
 choose good over evil."

<p>
 The professor bridles. "As a philosophical scientist, I don't vie this
 matter as having anything to do with any choice; as a realist, I
 absolutely do not recognize the concept of God or any other theological
 factor as
<br>
 being part of the world equation because God is not observable."

<p>
 "I would have thought that the absence of God's moral code in this<br>
world
<br>
 is probably one of the most observable phenomena going," the Christian
 replies. "Newspapers make billions of dollars reporting it every week!
 Tell me,
<br>
 professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?"

<p>
 "If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man,<br>
 yes, of course I do."
<br>
 "Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?"<br>

<p>
 The professor makes a sucking sound with his teeth and gives his
student
<br>
 a silent, stony stare.

<p>
 "Professor. Since no-one has ever observed the process of evolution at<br>
 work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor,
are
<br>
 you
<br>
 not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a
 priest?"

<p>
 "I'll overlook your impudence in the light of our philosophical<br>
 discussion. Now, have you quite finished?" the professor hisses.

<p>
<i> "So you don't accept God's moral code to do what is righteous?"</i><br>
 "I believe in what is - that's science!"<br>
 "Ahh! SCIENCE!" the student's face spits into a grin. "Sir, you rightly<br>
 state that science is the study of observed phenomena. Science too is a
 premise which is flawed..."
<br>
 "SCIENCE IS FLAWED..?" the professor splutters.<br>

<p>
 The class is in uproar. The Christian remains standing until the
 commotion has subsided.

<p>
 "To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student,<br>
may
<br>
 I give you an example of what I mean?"

<p>
 The professor wisely keeps silent.
<br>
 The Christian looks around the room.  "Is there anyone in the class who
 has ever seen the professor's brain?"

<p>
 The class breaks out in laughter.
<br>
 The Christian points towards his elderly, crumbling tutor. "Is there
 anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain...felt the
 professor's
<br>
 brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain?"

<p>
 No one appears to have done so.
<br>
 The Christian shakes his head sadly.  "It appears no one here has had
any
<br>
 sensory perception of the professor's brain whatsoever.  Well,
according
<br>
 to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science
says
<br>
 the
<br>
 professor has no brain."

<p>
 The class is in chaos.
<br>
 The Christian sits... Because that is what a chair is for.
