My cousin, Andrew Lorrey, is currently in Antarctica and working on problems like
this. They (his team from U Maine - Orino) are in a valley where there is buried
ice that is supposedly more than 8 million years old. They are hoping that the
stratified layers of this ice can tell them about not only the weather patterns
back then, but the durability of the Antarctic ice sheet to large world climatic
variations (like global warming), as well as answers to your question. He gets
back in a month, but I don't know how long it will take them to work through the
data they've collected.
