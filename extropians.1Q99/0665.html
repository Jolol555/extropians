&gt;&gt; Nothing scares me more than subjectivists in government positions,
&gt;&gt; because they are the ones who have the greatest potential to become
&gt;&gt; tyrants.

<a href="0635.html#0665qlink1">&gt; Are there *ANY* non-subjectivists in government positions?  An</a><br>
<i>&gt; objectivist would probably die rather than take a job in our current</i><br>
<i>&gt; "government".</i><br>

<p>
There are a few rational people in high office; Judge Posner
comes to mind.  And of course the most powerful man in the
country--Fed Chair Alan Greenspan--was one of the original
members of Rand's "collective".  You think the President has
power?  Last year, one casual remark by Mr. Greenspan about
the market's "irrational exuberance" was overheard, and that
day 200 billion dollars vanished from the planet.

<p>
Rand herself did not object to the idea of using public
office to accomplish things; if a robber hands you a gun,
would you not defend yourself with it?

<p>
P.S. For the nitpickers out there, yes, I know the Fed is
not technically a government office, much like the USPS is
officially a private enterprise.  Greenspan's job, however,
is subject to political pressure.
