Hi Natasha,

<p>
I congratulate you in your extremely perceptive, even brave, expression of
what's missing in the world view of our most intelligent compatriots.

<p>
I believe there is a simple solution to your longing (a longing that we all
share, I believe).

<p>
First of all, we can posit God as an inevitable outcome of technological
civilization (if it lasts long enough).  We don't need to get fuzzy and
mystical about it.

<p>
I agree about the failure of traditional religions, in fact, I believe
traditional religions have cost us a thousand years of scientific advancement
by their brutal suppresion of scientific thought.

<p>
May I suggest augmenting meditation, self-contemplation and intuition with
diligent study of the discoveries of modern science? 

<p>
Caring, warmth, empathy and the desire to improve ones self are important
aspects of a meaningful worldview.  It's a mistake to think these
characteristics can't coexist with criticalness and factualness.

<p>
I believe synergy is the essence of our future and the core of God.

<p>
Go for it!

<p>
Adrian Spidle
