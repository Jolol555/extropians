<a href="0221.html#0225qlink2">&gt; When the public was being fed the tripe that the Stealth Fighter</a><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Storm</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yeah -- I used to have a theory that Tom Clancy was actually a Naval</i><br>
<i>&gt; Intelligence "construct": It was just too improbable that some insurance</i><br>
<i>&gt; salesman from Kansas who'd never steered a boat in his life or written a word</i><br>
<i>&gt; of fiction could come out of nowhere with "The Hunt for Red October".  So I</i><br>
<i>&gt; figured he'd been "given" the novel by Naval Intell because it was full of</i><br>
<i>&gt; convincing disinformation, especially about SOSUS.  Then, along came "Red</i><br>
<i>&gt; Strom Rising" and his detailed description of the "F-19 Frisbee" that turned</i><br>
<i>&gt; out to be like what we THOUGHT the stealth program was creating, but was in</i><br>
<i>&gt; fact all wrong (it actually sounds like what the F-22 will eventually be).</i><br>

<p>
I good freind of mine was a sonar tech in the Navy, and when THFRO came out, he
had a copy down in the black room with his buddies, saying,"Is that classified?
No? OK, well, how bout that? No... no anymore. Oh ok..., etc etc".

<p>
<a href="0221.html#0225qlink3">&gt; So now, we have "Spike", a propulion engineer from Lockheed, who tells us just</a><br>
<i>&gt; enough about aerospikes to be convincing . . . .</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; . . . (really) just kidding . . .</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, Spike, if thats your REAL code name...
