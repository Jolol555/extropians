Though I haven't read the book, I found the following comment from a reader

A scientific argument supporting natural origins of life

<p>
This is a good book, elementary, accessible. Scientific readers seeking
something tangible about which to debate and argue should seek out
Kauffman's "The Origins of Order." Reading past reviews confirms one of my
fears, though: some will take the presentation as an alternate reality, a
'glimpse of God,' a profound set of propositions posited and proved. The
book is nothing like any of this--it is not a Bible, and its propositions
are certainly not accepted by much of the scientific community, not yet. But
it does present deep connections among highly interacting biological
systems--genetic regulatory networks, for example--and simple mathematical
models exhibiting rich and interesting behavior. Experiment will determine
over time whether any of Kauffman's work is scientifically meaningful, and
similar remarks hold for most of the output of the Santa Fe Institute. Is it
innovative? Absolutely. Intriguing? Certainly. Provocative? Without a
doubt--I'm rereading "The Origins of Order" for the second time. Is it
correct? That--as well as the conclusions from the hundreds of disparate
fields to which complexity has been applied--remains to be determined. But I
do think one should read this book, then go off and think a lot more about
what it means, maybe write a paper. But please, don't pray with this book;
don't pray to any science book.
