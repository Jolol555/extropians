<p>
That there's no rational reason to restrict your actions simply means
that you can do anything you want. Killing is just one of many options.

<p>
<i>&gt; This</i><br>
<a href="0548.html#0589qlink3">&gt; assumes of course that one only makes rational decisions.</a><br>

<p>
Well, one would expect that a SI would pay more attention to
reason than humans do, but you never know, of course...
 
<p>
<a href="0548.html#0589qlink4">&gt; Personally, I find no reason to kill off less powerful entities unless</a><br>

<p>
Fairy nuff. Personally I'd add "entities that are (very) likely to 
become threats in the near future".

<a href="0548.html#0589qlink5">&gt; My wiring makes me wish to increase my knowledge of the world.  A greater</a><br>
<i>&gt; number of species and individuals in the world allows for more complexity</i><br>
<i>&gt; and thus makes the world more interesting to me.  This would indicate to</i><br>
<i>&gt; me that I should avoid killing off less powerful entities, since I find</i><br>
<i>&gt; pleasure in increasing my knowledge of the world, and their evolution to</i><br>
<i>&gt; a higher power would make them and/or their species more interesting later.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you lack this incentive your mileage may vary, naturally.</i><br>

<p>
It all comes down to what one values more: "fun" or safety. Usually
the result is some form of compromise.
