<p>
As opposed to the polises, where humans are a few million Amish remnants?

<p>
If I found myself transported to the Culture I think I'd upload and start
growing up in short order.

<p>
Once, in the first book.  I suspected it was a ruse to make humans feel
better.  I hope he's reconsidered.

<i>&gt; narrative device.  </i><br>
</a>
<p>
How so?

<p>
<a href="3390.html#3515qlink5">&gt; writing on the Culture.  For instance,<a name="3520qlink5"> the human agents recruited by the</a><br>
<i>&gt; Culture are often subjected to rather appalling personal risks</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ordeals (which form the basis of the stories).  They're handsomely</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3390.html#3515qlink6">&gt; one-sided (from the Culture's point of view, the agents are being paid</a><br>
<i>&gt; trinkets to suffer agonies and risk their lives).</a>  The usefulness of these</i><br>

<p>
But they're not risking their lives.  Zakalwe risked his life because he
refused to be scanned.  The agent in _Consider Phlebas_ might have been at
risk either because Culture tech was less advanced, or more likely because
Banks hadn't thought of the consequences of Culture tech yet.  In _Use of
Weapons_ and _Excession_ human can be backed up just as much as Minds can;
Zakalwe simply opts out.

<p>
<a href="3390.html#3515qlink7">&gt; There's an air of decadence and boredom in the portrayals of the human</a><br>
<i>&gt; inhabitants of the Culture, particularly those who are not working for</i><br>

<p>
Well, there is the fact that there have been 9000 years of progress by
superhuman Minds.  I don't think it's possible for a mere human to even learn
enough to contribute much.  I don't think this is disappointing; it's what I'd
expect after that much progress.  That's what transhumanism means, to go
beyond the human.

<p>
And I think the same gulf existed with the polises; it just wasn't emphasized
as much.

<p>
<a name="3520qlink6"><a href="3390.html#3515qlink8">&gt; In many ways, the Culture represents the worst of contemporary human society</a><br>
<i>&gt; dressed up with AIs and ultratechnology.</a>  But most humans in the Culture</i><br>

<p>
The worst?

<p>
<a href="3390.html#3515qlink9">&gt; don't seem to have either the desire or the means to bridge the gap between</a><br>
<i>&gt; themselves and the Minds (who treat them with a scrupulous politeness that</i><br>

<p>
Well, if they did have the desire to bridge the gap, they wouldn't be human
anymore.  In realistic terms a Culture Mind can be roughly viewed as a nanoor
 quantum computer the size of a small whale.

<p>
<a href="3390.html#3515qlink10">&gt; In contrast to the narrative devices adopted by Banks and Vinge, there</a><br>
<i>&gt; is no gulf between humans and AIs in _Diaspora_.  Uploading is a fully-</i><br>

<p>
Apart from AIs being very cerebral, and immortal, and much faster, and having
lots of different senses...

<p>
<a href="3390.html#3515qlink11">&gt; To summarize, I would say that the essential difference between the world I</a><br>
<i>&gt; find emotionally appealing and the ones I find more alienating, is that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the former the humans are transformed en masse into their superiors, whereas</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the latter the humans have been superseded and left behind by their</i><br>
<i>&gt; superiors (the Minds, the Powers, and the TVC elite).  The transformation</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3520qlink7">Appealing: most humans chose to upload.  The rest live as quasi-religious
separatists (there hadn't been much contact between the fleshers and AIs for a
long time at the beginning) before eventually being killed off by the cosmos.
The AIs do not become particularly superhuman.</a>

<p>
Alienating: many humans choose not to upload.  They are indulgently pampered
by their godlike descendants.

<p>
<a name="3520qlink8">For sheer fun and safety, I'll go with the Culture myself.  Even if I couldn't
upload.</a>
