This all makes perfect sense, except for one nagging question - why do we
seem so much smarter than apes?  We have larger brains, but not by enough to
make much difference if this argument holds up.</a>

<p>
<a name="0223qlink2">I would suggest that there are two ways to improve one's intelligence.  The
easy way is to use faster hardware and/or improved heuristics to getter a
deeper search tree, which suffers the problems you suggest.  I will point
out, however, that increasing your search depth by 1 or 2 increments is not
a small change - it seems to be a decisive advantage in chess, for instance.</a>

<p>
<a name="0223qlink3">The hard way is to reformulate the problem in simpler terms, thus replacing
a combinatorial explosion with a solvable problem.  Evolution may have
managed something like this with humans - we have a higher-order
representation of the world that an ape, so we can solve much harder
problems with only a modest increase in processing power.</a>
