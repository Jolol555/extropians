Even at the time, without hindsight, some arguments against the
war were quite rational.  Particularly the argument that if it
were indeed a just war, why the limits?  Why the secrecy?  Why
the deception of the public?  Any time the government does
something covertly, it should be questioned vigorously. &gt;&gt;

<p>
That's a fairly nuanced and balanced response, Lee Daniel.  Thank you for the
opportunity to have a reasoned discussion of this matter, something that is
very rare in my experience, and yet, for me, it's very important as I still
remember those days powerfully.  I and many of my comrads (I recently joined
the VFW) feel unappreciated, even wounded, by the lack of understanding and
respect we received from our countrymen considering the sacrifices we made
<br>
(for our country and its citizens).<br>

<p>
I agree that the limits placed on US military action caused much unecessary
suffering and death among my cohort and the people of Southest Asia.  In fact
I think it was criminal on the part of our leaders.

hope you can keep your innocence forever, but in my mind, that very innocence
disqualifies your judgement in the manner.</a>
