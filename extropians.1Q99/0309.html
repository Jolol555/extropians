<p>
If I was a military planner, I wouldn't trust evolution one bit. If it
evolves to penetrate any defense, can't it evolve to penetrate *our*
defense? A weapon is only useful if you can threaten *others* with it,
not if you will be destroyed by it yourself (the exception is doomsday
devices, which work by making everybody very keen on their non-use).

<p>
So the threat isn't by rational military red goo (which might still be
quite nasty) but other sources.

<p>
<a href="0300.html#0309qlink2">&gt;  &gt; and solar power for energy supply, so its growth rate can't be too much</a><br>

<i>&gt; Photovoltaics means about 1 kW/m^2 peak, and there are a lot of these</i><br>
<i>&gt; m^2 out there. However, the color of the goo is grey, not green.</i><br>

<p>
The problem is protection against UV; you need some kind of protective
shielding or the units will break too often. Perhaps a layer of
photovoltaics on top of the real goo? Termite goo.

<p>
<a href="0300.html#0309qlink3">&gt;  &gt; faster than ordinary microorganisms.  A defensive system can mass-produce</a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; nanobots in industrial fabricators running off the electrical power grid.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; And what does electrical power grid run on? Magical fairy-dust? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Where is reconaissance, planning, production, transportation,</i><br>
<i>&gt; deployment, action analysis, all in an co-evolutionary scenario?</i><br>

<p>
Actually, this is also where the defenders have an advantage. Goo
doesn't just randomly appear (unless you really believe in the sudden
breakthrough scenario), there is a period before you meet the goo you
can plan (even without nanotech). A good defensive structure would
have the above abilities, but it is not clear that even autoevolving
goo would be able to do it (the fitness landscape has some pretty wide
deserts in this area where intelligent pre-planning can jump ahead a
lot; the goo will not be very good at planning, or the brainy nanites
will have a too low replication rate to be big threats).
