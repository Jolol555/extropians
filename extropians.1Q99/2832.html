<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Give me a few statistics and I'll do the math.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 1) Average time spent handling gun</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While the stats for the two below are rather easy to establish, the one</i><br>
above is
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink4">&gt;not, and I doubt you will get many people agreeing on the criteria to</a><br>
measure
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink5">&gt;it. For example:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;in 'handling' a gun, do you mean the amount of time it is actually in hand</i><br>
being
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink6">&gt;fired? If that is the only criterion you accept then you are obviously</a><br>
trying to
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink7">&gt;skew the stats.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since a gun is a deterrent weapon, (esp. seeing as how the FBI estimates</i><br>
that
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink8">&gt;guns are used in defense against criminals 2 million times a year without</a><br>
<i>&gt;firing, merely being brandished) merely carrying a gun on one's person or</i><br>
having
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink9">&gt;one close at hand ( in the glove box, in your desk, in your night stand,</a><br>
etc.)
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink10">&gt;should count as 'time handling a gun'. If you accept this, I think you will</a><br>
find
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink11">&gt;that time handling a gun is actually much higher than either of the two</a><br>
below. I
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink12">&gt;personally spend an hour or so in the bathroom a day, and maybe two hours a</a><br>
day
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink13">&gt;on the road. I am carrying or have my gun close at hand 24/7. I spend 2-4</a><br>
hours
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink14">&gt;a week firing guns on the practice range (mostly skeet, though I try to pop</a><br>
off
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink15">&gt;a few mags on my 9mm at least once a week or so). I think that you will</a><br>
find
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink16">&gt;that most gun owners who aren't just collectors have similar habits. Most</a><br>
at
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink17">&gt;least keep one close at hand in the bedroom for night time security, which</a><br>
would
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink18">&gt;make their 'handling' rate about 6-10 hours a day.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 2) Average time spent in bathroom</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; 3) Average time spent in car</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm not trying to manipulate data... I'm trying to use some meaningful</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; statistics. For example, people might say that bees are more dangerous</i><br>
than
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink19">&gt;&gt; great white sharks, simply because there are a greater number of bee</a><br>
deaths
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink20">&gt;&gt; than great white deaths... you get where I'm going with this.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes I do. Try it out and see where you get. Counting 'handling' as having a</i><br>
gun
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink21">&gt;on one's person or close at hand is exactly like time spent in an idling</a><br>
car at
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink22">&gt;a stoplight (one of the higher risk situations to be in, in a car, as a</a><br>
matter
<br>
<a href="2828.html#2832qlink23">&gt;of fact.) or stuck in traffic.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mike Lorrey</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Might it be important to consider what percentage of people own guns? This
would figure highly in average time handling gun. Also, it seems that having
the gun close but not being in contact with it would be equivalent to
sitting in your car in your  driveway with the engine on.

<p>
I apologize if I'm bothering you with this, but I am playing devil's
advocate here.... after all, you're the one's complaining about misused
stats.
