I don't see any reason why the first goo powerful enough to destroy our
race and/or all multicellular life would necessarily have the capability
to survive in vacuum, resist cosmic radiation, operate on solar power,
and build spaceships with reentry capability.  Anything that
well-designed isn't an indiscriminate killer.  It isn't "indestructable
and ravenous by definition"; it just needs to be indestructable and
ravenous enough to kill us off.  There was a time when wolves came close
to being that indestructable and ravenous.

<a name="0180qlink1"><a name="0176qlink2">That having been said, I doubt spike's Gray Filter scenario.  I can see
many races, even the majority, destroying themselves that way.  But zero
survivors?  Not even one in a thousand?  I don't believe</a> it.  Not even
the Singularity has that kind of kill ratio - hence my guess that
Singularities also suck up any other visible races.
