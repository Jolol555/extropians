<p>
OK. But monopolizing something that a lot of others may have also
downloaded is quite tricky. Just look at the Scientologists hunting
the Fishman papers - if their beliefs were actually true and they had
the aid of thetan powers, would they still be able to keep the lid on?


<p>
<a name="0814qlink3"><a href="0338.html#0394qlink2">&gt; The term "naive" is strong.  I began using this term when, during a</a><br>
<i>&gt; debate on red goo vs. blue goo, I pointed out nobody had proposed any</i><br>
<i>&gt; sort of active shield that would stand up to nuclear weapons,</a> and</i><br>
<i>&gt; someone said, quote, "That's not fair."  Fair?  Whoa.  "I never thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; of that", says the Universe, and everyone comes back to life.  I suppose</i><br>
<i>&gt; that dropping 20 megatons on an undefended city is fair.  Fact is,</i><br>
<i>&gt; offensive technology is running far enough ahead of defensive technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; to blast civilization right now, fair or unfair, and I think the problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; will only get worse.  An honest assertion that active shields can stand</i><br>
<i>&gt; up to fusion weapons is one thing.  Pretending that nobody will try to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use nanotech for military attack and world domination is naive.</i><br>

<p>
I think the problem is that you move the problem from a question about
how to counteract hostile nanosystems to a problem of counteracting
anything your enemy might throw at you. That is a bit like asking that
the security systems of an elevator should work against somebody
blowing up the building.

<p>
<a name="0814qlink5">The important thing is to do a threat analysis, and try to see what
countermeasures (including the 36th stratagem, running away)</a> are
useful in a hostile situation. But to do that you ned to understand
the different kinds of threats and the available countermeasures well,
and not claim that countermeasures against A are useless because they
do not work against weapon B. An active shield is useless against a
nuclear explosion, but a nuclear weapon is useless if you don't know
where to aim it or the political repercussions on you will be more
severe than you can handle. What is needed is a better understanding
of the threat matrix of weapons and countermeasures; where are the big
holes, where are one side at a noticeable advantage, and what
strategies can both sides take to maximize their utility.
