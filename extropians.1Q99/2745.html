<p>
If you want a detailed look at the programming issues, I'd suggest Eliezer
Yudkowsky's essay on the topic at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~sentience/AI_design.temp.html">http://www.pobox.com/~sentience/AI_design.temp.html</a>
His approach is a bit unconventional, but it looks promising.

<p>
Another approach would be to map out the general structure of the human
brain, and duplicate the features of its components using evolved neural
nets.  The Robokenko project (see <a href="http://www.genobyte.com">http://www.genobyte.com</a> ) is doing some
interesting work in this direction, although their goal is simply
animal-level intelligence.

<p>
We don't really know enough yet to predict what approach will work best.
However, I expect that we will see a lot of progress over the next few
years.  Computers are finally getting fast enough to support something more
complex than an insect brain, and some of AIs long-promised goals are
finally being reached.  Hopefully, support for more advanced work will grow
fast enough to let us take advantage of the new capabilities.

<p>
Sure.  Its the Cyc project, and they've got a pretty good web site:

<p>
<a href="http://www.cyc.com/">http://www.cyc.com/</a>

<p>
Their goal is to create a system that encodes all of the "common sense"
knowledge required to understand your average encyclopedia article.  They've
produced some interesting results, but they still haven't really achieved
their goal.
