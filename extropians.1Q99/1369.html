<a href="1336.html#1369qlink1">&gt; &gt; My question:  Do you know whether these statistics include _all_ guns, or only those</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that are privately owned?  If the statistics include those owned by gov't agents,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; used in their enforcement duties, then the argument seems much weaker than if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; includes only guns owned by private citizens.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If the statistics do refer to all guns, is there further data available so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; statistics for privately owned guns may be derived?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure, but here's another stat that might help out: A police officer is 5 times</i><br>
<i>&gt; more likely to kill an innocent person at any given crime scene than would an armed</i><br>
<i>&gt; private citizen in the same situation. So, I would say that if government agents are</i><br>
<i>&gt; included, they are merely dampening the stats down. Excluding them and they should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher.</i><br>

Thanks.  I understand (and agree).  However, one can argue this statistic occurs because
officers are generally not present to witness the initial violence (a private citizen
involved probably was a witness), and will perhaps have hair-triggers because they're
entering situations known to be violent, and know they wear uniforms that may attract
bullets.  I was indeed hoping that the statistics you provided did exclude gov't officers,
because it makes for a stronger argument.
