<a href="2620.html#2626qlink1">&gt;The goal of Hollian Enquiry is to get at whatever truth is</a><br>
<i>&gt;accessible to the parties, compared to the goal of a debate,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which is for one side to win and make the other side lose.</i><br>

<p>
A good idea. I remember a discussion we had in the military where
someone tried to claim the USSR fell behind in computer technology
because they tried to develop a technology that would give
proportional answers rather than a digital yes or no. My roommate
said this was nuts until I reminded him about analog computers.


<p>
<a href="2620.html#2626qlink2">&gt;The point is that we were able to talk civilly about a highly</a><br>
<i>&gt;charged controversy and almost agree on a resolution. Wouldn't it</i><br>
<i>&gt;be more appropriate for legislators to talk civilly about</i><br>
<i>&gt;broadening perspectives and resolving issues rather than bragging</i><br>
<i>&gt;about defeating right or left wing extremists and other such</i><br>
<i>&gt;subhuman ignoramuses?</i><br>

<p>
Again a good idea, the problem is that resolution in not always
possible. In the example you gave (abortion), I don't believe the
state ever has rights in the matter until after birth, when a new
citizen has been created. I believe the rights of the mother (to
chose) are inviolable till then.
