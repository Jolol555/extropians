<p>
Private email is quite useful for resolving problems that are irrelevant to
the group, for venting personal peeves about others.

<p>
Yes, bragging about one's good deeds is not productive. You should get your
own self satisfaction from frying some rat bastard spammer. However, we are
all human and are liable to make mistakes from time to time, forgetting to
treat one's fellow listmembers with more courtesy than a spammer would, and
considering the large number of people on the list, I'm surprised there
aren't more such mistakes, but then again, we have a bright crew here, for
the most part....;)

<p>
Is this a problem you have in regards to people's general conversation or
when they are just pointedly bragging and name dropping? This list is a
means of being informative and educational to the public on extropy, so
newbies are highly likely to ask questions (of an informed or uninformed
nature), and very likely to contest facts and posititions that most
extropians take for granted as true. Some may be receptive to instruction,
and others may just be hostile.

Uh, what is this message?

<p>
One man's drivel is another man's eloquence. Depends on what your agenda is.
What is yours?

<p>
Apparently your agenda is to continue to contribute to spam by using 'free'
email services that impose costs of advertising on others. TANSTAAFL!!! You
shouldn't throw stones in glass houses.
