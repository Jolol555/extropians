<a href="1170.html#1173qlink1">&gt; I think, however, that we are still safe.  There are some formidable</a><br>
<i>&gt; problems with nano-scale (or even micro-scale) nuclear devices, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; seem to be more a matter of fundamental physics than simple engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt; constrains.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; First, there is a size requirement for the fuel.  A fusion reaction releases</i><br>
<i>&gt; most of its energy in the form of hard x-rays, which are then absorbed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the rest of the fuel, which produces the heat that sustains the chain</i><br>
<i>&gt; reaction.  If you make the device too small the x-rays aren't captured, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; you can't produce a chain reaction.  Even with nanotech, its hard to see how</i><br>
<i>&gt; you could make a device less than a few inches in diameter without this</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem being fatal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Second, there is a power storage problem.  Current bomb designs use a small</i><br>
<i>&gt; fission bomb to produce the energy that starts their fusion reaction.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt; laser ignition system would need a similar amount of power, but it has to</i><br>
<i>&gt; get it from a non-nuclear source.  That means you need a capacitor system</i><br>
<i>&gt; much bigger than the bomb itself - and we've already seen that the bomb has</i><br>
<i>&gt; a minimum size.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Third, as you noted, there is a diminishing yield problem.  Even nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt; weapons only produce so much bang per pound, and if you start measuring the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bomb size in micrograms it gets pretty puny.  A robot mosquito might carry</i><br>
<i>&gt; as much punch as a truck bomb, if you could make a bomb that small - but</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's no big deal with reasonably advanced nanotech.  Anything much smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; than that won't even produce an explosion - it will simply produce a flash</i><br>
<i>&gt; of radiation when it detonates.</i><br>

<a name="1212qlink2"><a name="1175qlink1">Lessee, you can make a 10 kiloton weapon these days to fit in a suitcase,</a> lets
<a name="1175qlink2">say, generously that that suitcase still weighs in at 100 kilos., so 100
kilogram devices can produce 10 million kilograms of TNT levels</a> of explosive
<a name="1175qlink3">power. A ratio of 100,000 to 1. If a microgram nuke device</a> is proportionate in
</a>
<a name="1175qlink4">capability, if there is not a steep falloff in capability, then it should
produce the equivalent of 100 grams of TNT of explosive force. This is far from
a trivial amount if a robotic bug can deliver it into</a> your eardrum.....its equal
to a good fraction of a stick of dynamite blowing up in your<a name="1175qlink5"> ear.... Whatever is
</a>
left gets fried from radiation...
