<a href="0407.html#0417qlink1">&gt;...and we like these things because of our evolutionary heritage. It's not</a><br>
<i>&gt;a matter of personal whim at all, but an objectively verifiable nexus of</i><br>
<i>&gt;instinctual responses. In humans, of course, these instincts are usually</i><br>
<i>&gt;regularized by the application of reason, resulting in codes of conduct</i><br>
<i>&gt;whose relative wisdom can be ascertained by observing the results with</i><br>
<i>&gt;reference to our biological imperatives, i.e. objectively. Thus, we have</i><br>
<i>&gt;both an objective basis for formulating ethical standards and an objective</i><br>
<i>&gt;means of verifiying the worth (workability) of a given standard.</i><br>



<p>
<a name="0449qlink1">So if it's a biological imperative it's "right".  Boy is your life</a> going to
be odd!<a name="0449qlink2">  Oh and you're still going to have to work out which bits of the way
people are is defined by genetics and which bit is cultural.</a>


<p>
<a href="0407.html#0417qlink2">&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd feel distinctly uneasy around anyone who actually believes that not</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;conking me over the head to take my watch is just an arbitrary personal</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;preference.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I felt the same way for a while.  [...]  When nothing nasty happens and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;people continue acting in a reasonable way, the feeling goes away.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You're begging the question of _why_ people continue to act in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;"reasonable" way. (Note that you've just vitiated your own argument, since</i><br>
<i>&gt;if it's reasonable, then it's not arbitrary, i.e. not subjective.)</i><br>


<p>
Sorry, replace the word reasonable with 'polite', that's what I meant
(reasonable behaviour over here in England is a euphemism for polite
behaviour)

<p>
<a href="0407.html#0417qlink3">&gt;The fact of the evolution of life provides profound insight into why we</a><br>
<i>&gt;consistently, as a species, choose certain values and reject other things</i><br>
<i>&gt;as "evil". As such, I consider it the only firm basis for ethical theory.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sort of the "missing link" in the natural law tradition.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="0449qlink4">Evolution only show what is necessary for survival, which mostly</a> appears to
<a name="0449qlink5">be the ability to bop your neighbour over the head and steal his</a> country as
<a name="0449qlink6">rapidly as possible, while shaggin as many of his women as possible.</a>

<p>
<a name="0449qlink7">I don't recall any natural societies of any species in which</a> animals refrain
<a name="0449qlink8">from stealing from each other when each others backs are turned, or from
indulging ion all sorts of conduct which would seem</a> to be anti-libertarian.
