<a href="1322.html#1407qlink1">&gt;there is a logical error called the argument of irrelevance (if i remember</a><br>

<p>
Yes, that is common in this area: don't ask and don't tell.

<p>
This interests me a lot.

<p>
<a name="1414qlink1">Why does knowing that IQ is "real" (read:  "general ability is a valid 
construct) and that it is heritable ( read: heritability is greater than  
zero in any known environment) lead to racism and even race war?</a>

<p>
JP Rushton argues that there will be a race war, pointing to such figures 
as mean IQs in some black African nations of 75. But i just don't get why 
any of this "leads" to either racism or race wars. 

<p>
I, like most scientists in the area believe that there is a general 
ability factor and that a substantial part of individual differences on 
this factor are at present (though not, i believe in the future) due to 
differences in genes. However,  I am not at all racist nor would I ever 
support anything remotely resembling a war based on race. 

<p>
SO then, why do most people seem to make this connection?

<p>
My only conclusion is that these individuals would steal other peoples 
goods if they could and that low IQ makes theft without punishment more 
likely.

<p>
Historically, it seems that most wars occur in the opposite 
circumstances: very similar peoples fighting for niche possession 
(England/France and Germany, the north and south in the USA (how much 
more similar can you get?) -- and that was the bloodiest conflict America 
has experienced in all its history, up to and including the modern day.

<p>
Other peoples thoughts welcome, but I think that understanding how our 
minds and brains work, even if those answers involve genes DECREASES  
racism. 

<p>
My prime exhibit would be decrease homophobia in the 20th century 
following both large social trends in tolerance, but also scientific 
advances in understanding these differences between us. 

<p>
cheers,
