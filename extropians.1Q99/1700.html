Not my fault, but I like Machiavelli.  At least he's a clear thinker
most of the time.</a>  His advice with respect to flattery is a particularly
good example of practicality untouched by moral extremes:  {When anyone
can tell the truth about you, you lose their respect; but when nobody
can tell the truth, you can't get any advice:  Therefore, get just a few
advisers who can tell the truth about you but continue to punish anyone
else.}  This is not advice I intend to follow, but it clearly admits the
existence of the problem and proposes a practical solution.  I respect that.

"Nor let him ever believe that a state can always make safe choices; on
the contrary, let him think that he must make only doubtful ones;
because this is in the order of things, that one never tries to avoid
one inconvenience without incurring another; but prudence consists of
knowing how to recognize the kinds of inconveniences, and to take the
least sad for good."
