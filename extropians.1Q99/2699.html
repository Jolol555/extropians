The accumulation of lots of short term projects colonizing the 
asteroids &amp; comets would produce vastly more liveable area than
found by terraforming a few moons.  No need to take apart planets.
Yet when they consider meeting in the asteroids rather than at a 
planet, that is considered a "nowhere place".  This suggests the
asteriods have been hardly touched.
