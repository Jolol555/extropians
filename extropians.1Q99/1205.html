Abstract
<br>
  The possibility that the taking of vitamin supplements may influence mood was
  explored. One hundred and twenty-nine young healthy adults took either 10
  times the recommended daily dose of 9 vitamins, or a
  placebo, under a double-blind procedure, for a year. Males taking the
  vitamins differed from those taking the placebo in that they
  reported themselves as feeling more 'agreeable' after 12 months. After 12
  months the mood of females taking the vitamin supplement was significantly
  improved in that they felt more 'agreeable', more composed and reported
  better mental health. These changes in mood after a year occurred even though
  the blood status of 9 vitamins reached a plateau after 3
  months: this improvement in mood was associated in particular with improved
  riboflavin and pyridoxine status. In females baseline thiamin status was
  associated with poor mood and an improvement in thiamin status after 3 months
  was associated with improved mood.
