<a name="2307qlink1">What I would like to see is that they are given fundamental values 
that include respect for human rights. In addition to that, I think 
it would in many cases be wise to require that artificial 
intelligences that are not yet superintelligences (and so cannot 
perfectly understand and follow through on their fundamental values) 
should be built with some cruder form of safeguards that would 
prevent them from harming humans. I'm thinking of house-robots and 
such, that should perhaps be provided with instincts that make it 
impossible for them to do certain sequences of actions (ones that 
would harm themselves or humans for example).</a>

<a href="2286.html#2292qlink2">&gt; Perhaps the line could be re-worded to avoid this confusion?  Something like</a><br>
<i>&gt; "In the first case, we could make sure that they possess a thorough</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding of, and respect for, existing human moral codes that emphasize</i><br>
<i>&gt; respect and toleration of others." would seem to convey your intended</i><br>
<i>&gt; meaning without the possibility of confusion.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2307qlink2">Understanding is not enough; the will must also be there. They should 
*want* to respect human rights, that's the thing. It should be one of 
their fundamental values, like caring for your children's welfare is 
a fundamental value for most humans.</a>
