These kinds of analyses ignore the costs of patent enforcement and the 
benefits of incremental improvement.<a name="2194qlink1">  Rigorous enforcement of emerging 
US patent law would almost end software</a> innovation since every couple 
lines of code you write will require a patent search.  

<p>
What happens in industries like (until 
<br>
recently) fashion and software algorithms is that each new idea is only
developed when it is relatively cheap but that most new achievements in
turn make other achievements relatively cheap (in particular, incremental
improvements).

<a name="2194qlink2"><a name="2183qlink1"><a name="2164qlink1">Twice in the 19th century (Netherlands 1830s to 1850s and Switzerland 1870s
to 1890s) patent laws were repealed mostly for ideological reasons (ideas
should be free, etc.)  In neither case did technological innovation decrease.
In Switzerland this coincided with a spectacular increase in chemical industry
innovation which resulted in the Swiss chemical and pharmeceutical industries.</a>
<a name="2194qlink3">Once they got large, of course, the new companies lobbied patent laws back
in, ostensibly to protect</a> research (in spite of their own impressive 
achievements without patents) but more plausibly to protect themselves from
competition.
