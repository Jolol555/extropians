I will be an economics professor this fall, and to me the major limit
on creating a course in ideas related to transhumanism is a lack of 
academic quality papers in the area.  The first courses in new areas 
are usually based on stacks of related papers.   Students can then be
assigned to read them, comment on them, and attempt to produce work 
like them.  I can't honestly say there enough such papers for me to 
consider trying to create a course yet.

analyses as you do to posting in this mailing list, we might soon have
enough papers though.</a>  If normal academic journals needlessly reject 
your submissions, consider submitting them to Journal of Transhumanism
(where I am chief editor).
