Sorry I lost the original post.

<p>
I humbly suggest that you reconsider your intentions.
What bothers me is that you state that you have a 
very particular question you feel the need to answer.  
Already a bad sign.  In addition, this question has 
something to do with you and your personal experiences.  
IOW,<a name="2233qlink1"> you seem to be seeking to understand yourself 
more completely.  Though laudable, this is not a good 
reason to become a psychiatrist or cognitive scientist.</a>

<p>
<a name="2254qlink3">Seek this line of work because you are completely 
fascinated with it and because you truly wish to make a 
contribution to the science, knowing full well that you are 
currently too ignorant/naive to know precisely how you will 
accomplish this task.

<p>
Best wishes,

<p>
Scott Badger
