Yes, if you behave like a Kook, people will brand you as one.
With the Kookify/Glorify function your reputation becomes public knowledge.
You cannot escape your reputation by refusing the Kookify/Glorify software.
Censorship is not the answer to a bad implementation of reputations.

<p>
You might want to have a reputation half-life implemented to solve the problem.
Unless somebody really find you offensive, your bad reputation would diminish
over time, until such time when you would become unKookified.

<p>
But... what you write will continue to haunt you in the form of list archives.
You cannot escape your reputation by refusing the Kookify/Glorify software.

Solution: Make a more complex reputation survival function.

	  Do not kill off a good idea because the implementation sucks.
	  Suggest and make a better implementation instead.

<p>
Yes, we should avoid statist implementations of reputations.

<p>
Nobody should live forever on old glory, and we should not assume that old
Kooks cannot become enlightened.  We should prepare for change.
