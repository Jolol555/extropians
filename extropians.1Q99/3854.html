<i>&gt; low energy levels, the SI will probably have to migrate to some location</i><br>
<i>&gt; where high energy densities can be achieved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If such projects are not possible, the SI will probably migrate to whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of the universe is best suited for its projects.  Since all of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; options that have been suggested require exotic physical conditions (i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; the surface of a neutron star), I conclude that there is little chance it</i><br>
<i>&gt; would want to stay here.  So, once again the odds are in our favor.</i><br>

<a name="3884qlink1">You argue the the SI will not concern itself with slow atomic-scale
activity because it doesn't want to wait. You postulate migration to
a "swinging hot spot" instead.</a> I don't think this works. If the SI is concerned
with time, it surely won't<a name="3884qlink2"> want to take the time to migrate. It if wants
</a>
a neutron star, it will simply convert the sun.<a name="3884qlink3"> If migration is the only
</a>
option, the SI will take all the mass/energy it can with it, probably
<a name="3884qlink4">making an optimum tradeoff between mass/energy expended for propulsion
versus mass/energy that can be devoted to computation enroute,</a> The available
mass for this project is the mass in the solar system, nearly all of which
is in the sun. Conversion of the sun to a neutron star or the use of its
mass for propulsion is "mere" mega-scale engineering, requiring no new
physics.<a name="3884qlink5"> FTL travel and customized universes require new physics.
