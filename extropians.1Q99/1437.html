Actually, "overkill" might not be as relevant a concept as it once was. 
For one, take the cell phone part--how many companies
&lt;italic&gt;don't&lt;/italic&gt; make what was once an extraordinary and unheard of
offer to attract customers?  Plus, look at the average computer user
today with CD roms, multiple disk drives, Internets, Personal Web Sites,
Word Processing, Calendars/Schedules (complete with daily alarms),
Instant Messenger... it seems people want to maximize their features with
every large electronic device that they own.  I think that if someone can
replace a majority or all of their personal electronic devices with one
easy to carry device, chances are that they will.  


<p>
I also doubt that this will cause the industry to dry up immediately. 
Producers will naturally find more applications and add-ons to WWVs.  If
this wasn't true, how many producers would we find for more commonly
found products, such as TVs?
