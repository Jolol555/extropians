In a message dated 1/27/99 7:38:16 PM Central Standard Time, it was said.

<pre>
&gt; &gt;&gt;"In program
<br>
<a href="1312.html#1315qlink1">&gt;  &gt;&gt; area after program area, we have found that unfocused and</a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; uncoordinated [overlapping] programs waste scarce funds,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; confuse and frustrate  taxpayers and other program</i><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; customers, and limit overall program effectiveness,"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;&gt; the report states.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Isn't it strange, when the stated role of the government</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is general coordination of social activities, meaningful</i><br>
<i>&gt;  allocation of funds, and overall social order and effectiveness.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Coercive funding and coercive implementation of programs</i><br>
<i>&gt;  remove incentives to improve coordination and effectiveness,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  so whether the centralized system could actually deliver them,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is a moot point - it won't bother [too much, anyway].</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Wasn't Communism a good enough lesson here?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
I'd like to address that in my usual uncoordinated way.

<p>
I see and I've been led to beleive that the original purpose and allowable
function of &lt;federal&gt; government in the United States was severely limited.
That is.  1. To Protect the borders &lt;military&gt; 2. Legislative  3. Judiciary.

<p>
Anything else is unlawful.  Historicaly I beleive it is seen tht government
does anything else very poorly. It doesnt do very well even at those three.

<p>
Addittionally. 

<p>
The other day I heard a broadcast of the proceedings of "The commonwealth club
of California".  From the San Francisco Area (the No  spanking zone).  The
topic was Russia.

<p>
The concensus of opinion was that Russia was going to melt-down.  More so than
already.  And that there wasn't  a thing that would stop it.

<p>
One of the speakers brought up the point that the singular difference between
Russia and the West was Statism vs Individualism.  Statism self destructed.

<p>
Yet our government continually limits the rights and powers of individuals.
