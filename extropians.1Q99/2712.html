Adrian,

<p>
You ask a difficult question.
<br>
<a name="2721qlink1"><a name="2717qlink1">I know of only 1 group of people who have no fear of death.
Those who believe it is not final.</a></a>
<br>
I've listened to Theists who are comforted by the thought 
of life after death.  I've read Non-Theists who believe in a 
reincarnation, and a non-ending of self. I even imagine that 
there are some pro-cryonics people who are not</a> particularly 
afraid of death, because they expect to be frozen, and later 
revived.

<p>
On the other hand (and I expect disagreement here) I do not 
think that human contemplating his/her own permanent end 
is likely to be comfortable with that eventuality.  I can see 
preferring an immediate end to the option of continuing to 
linger in pain for a while longer and then dying, but I cannot
see anyone being comfortable with their own permanent end,
and psychologically healthy at the same time.

<p>
As a compassionate ( but nonetheless brave ) atheist
I would not bring up the taoist preparation for dying, as it does
not (likely) go along with your friend's beliefs.  Just as a preacher
friend of mine will not preach to someone who is dying, without
an invitation at least.  No need to cause more pain.

<p>
As a principled ( and young ) atheist, I could not tell her that I 
think there is a God.  However, I am not so cold as to tell her 
that there is none.  It does neither her, nor her family, nor me 
any good to do so.

<p>
As a kind (but cautious) extropian, I might try to find out how
she feels about cryonics, but I could not push that on her.
Of anything to benefit her and/or her kin in reality, rather than
in what seems to be a comfort based on falsehood, cryonics 
seems to have the best chances, for I can conceive of it 
working.  I appear to have too limited of an imagination to
buy into any flavor of omni-.

<p>
What is left for the compassionate, yet principled atheist?
Being a friend.  Not trying to have answers, not trying to 
give solutions.  It sounds to me as if your friend and her family
are going through a hard time.  The thing I would give them
would be genuine human love and compassion, without 
promises I don't believe about some uncertain future.  They 
need love,understanding, and someone to talk to now.

<p>
Respectfully,

<p>
--Kyle
