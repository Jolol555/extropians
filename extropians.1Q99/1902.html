I think their movie shows the plane exploding downward like a rocket. In 
other words it didn't reach appogee and turnover like an albatross, it 
was being thrust violently upwards under full throttle, suffered an 
alteration in attitude due to its own fuel exploding and then rapidly 
accelerated towrad the earth, continuing some thrust and much burn.

<p>
Also, it is quite inappropriate to translate their about x seconds and 
"about a mile" 6 
<br>
o'clock news commentary into a calculus of precise feet and seconds.
