It does?  I only know of a few in which the entire population was
well-armed, and they mostly seem to be libertarian places...

<a href="3456.html#3461qlink3">&gt;&gt; Why would you have to pay? If you don't want police 'protection' you just</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; buy a gun or two and protect yourself. That's not an option in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; government </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; system... and anyway, private protection will be a lot cheaper than </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; compulsory tax-funded government 'protection'.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is the kind of naiveté that gives anarcho-capitalism a bad name.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;can't protect yourself.  If you aren't signed up with a PPA, you are a</i><br>
<i>&gt;legitimate target for anyone who finds it worthwhile to rob, kill and/or</i><br>
<i>&gt;enslave you.  If significant numbers of people choose this option, some</i><br>
<i>&gt;organization will soon develop to exploit their lack of protection.  Any</i><br>
<i>&gt;such group will quickly learn how to field trained, organized teams of</i><br>
<i>&gt;soldiers to do their dirty work, which means a lone man with a gun is</i><br>
<i>&gt;essentially helpless.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3467qlink1">The problem with this statement is that technology seems to be 
moving in direction of more power for the individual.  That is, a 
large group of well-tained people is not significantly more capable
than a single person, when sufficiently high technology is had by
both sides.  One hidden person with a fiber-guided missile is 
approximately equal to a tank with three crew.</a>

<p>
<a href="3456.html#3461qlink4">&gt;&gt; Sorry? What? Huh? Where do you get that idea from?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;From my definitions - I'm comparing the ideal anarcho-capitalist society</i><br>
<i>&gt;with an ideal limited government.  An ideal limited government would have</i><br>
<i>&gt;laws against theft, fraud, assault, murder, and a few other such crimes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;plus tax evasion.  A typical PPA would have a similar code, minus the tax</i><br>
<i>&gt;evasion (but if you don't pay up, you loose your protection).  The anarchist</i><br>
<i>&gt;approach gives you some options on the details, but there is no reason for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the big picture to differ by much.</i><br>

<p>
As long as the bosses are willing to violate rights by stea--taxing, what
possible reason for not infringing "just a little more" could they have? 
This is the difference between customers and subjects.
 
<p>
<a href="3456.html#3461qlink5">&gt;&gt; &gt;Those who have power take whatever they want</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;from those who don't, which results in a society with all the problems of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;despotism and none of the advantages.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Only if you assume that a couple of hundred million well-armed anarchists</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; are just going to stand aside and hand over their money to a few thugs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm not assuming, I'm quoting history.  The well-armed citizens *are* the</i><br>
<i>&gt;thugs.  On of the most perverse effects of simple anarchy is that it gives</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyone strong incentives to act like a criminal, and punishes those who do</i><br>
<i>&gt;not.</i><br>

<p>
You seem to be implicitly assuming that only a few are really
well-armed...
