<a name="3104qlink1">I suppose this is rather selfish but when I heard of
the death of Stanley Kubrick the first consequence that
came to my mind was that the film entitled "AI" would
never make it to the big screen.  The rumor mill had
dubbed "AI" has Kubrick's next effort after "Eyes Wide Shut".

<p>
While there was (and still is) always a robust rumormill 
circulating about Kubrick, the AI rumor had particular 
substance to it.  There are even indications that Kubrick 
was consorting with Lucas' ILM to bring Kubrick's vision 
to the big screen. Alas, mortality.</a>
