<a name="1054qlink1">  IAN: The initial point was that a collective 
  is not an entity as in a "thing," if it's a
  matter of it being a conscious being, that 
  ventures into the deep. Life per se tends
  to display consciousness if we correlate
  consciousness with learning. The process
  of evolution is a learning process, but
  exactly who is learning seems to me to  
  be the same question "exactly who am</a> I?"

  In short, assuming that the mind houses 
  a spirit is the same as assuming a group
  houses a spirit, and yet assuming that a
  mind houses a spirit proves very practical.
