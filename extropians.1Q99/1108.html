<a name="1118qlink1">The Market would seem to fit certain criteria' matching those of a
collective/conceptual entity,
<br>
despite being a set of relationships of objects.
Indeed, the Economy would also seem to fit these criteria.  Even if the
Economy is viewed as a stage where interactions are played out, there
must be entities such as nations &amp; corporations playing their roles, in
addition to the individual humans.

<p>
I guess my point is that Ayn Rand was wrong;
</a>
there are plenty of things consisting of smaller
<br>
(semi)autonomous units that act as &amp; are treated by others as discreet<br>
entities.  Doesn't systems theory have something to say about
whether or nor something is a discreet entity depends on what level of
organization within a system you are analysing @ the moment?
