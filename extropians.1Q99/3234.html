While a literal thermal superconductor is not known to exist (with the exception of
laser beams and plasmas), using current thermocouple technology and room temperature
electrical superconductors (yet to be developed, but expected to be not far off) one
could easily join the two technologies. Use the thermocouple technology at each end of
a sky hook (or each end linked to heat absorption and radiation thermocouple farms),
and use electrical superconductors to conduct the current generated by the thermocouple
farms.

<p>
Laser beams could also be used in the blue-green wavelengths to transmit heat into
space. On a related note, you may recall the 'sunflowers' that Niven described in his
Ringworld trilogy. Niven mistakenly described the weather effects of the blight of
these plants as heating the atmosphere up and creating a desert. Deserts get hot
because the sand is a thermal insulator that reradiates much light as heat. The
'sunflowers', having reflective surfaces, would not  degrade the light thus and so the
region with such plants should become cooler. I know this sounds counterintuitive, but
its kinda like a Bose-Einstein condensate in this way.
