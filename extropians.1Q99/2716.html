Billy,

<p>
   Thank you for taking the time to comment on my hypothetical.  I think
perhaps I used the wrong term.  I should not have called my program an expert
system program, as you seem to indicate that this involves a specific type of
programming as opposed to its purpose.  What I really wanted was a
hypothetical program that could give "expert" advice on its subject, and learn
from experience.  I also had its hypothetical designer add on some of the
programs capabilities later on, such as giving it a broader knowledge base to
give context to its decisions.<a name="2745qlink1">  Could you perhaps suggest some programming
techniques that might in future produce the type of AI I have suggested, or is
this not a realistic possibility?</a>

<p>
<a name="2745qlink2">    I was interested to hear that some big project has been working on
developing such an expert system for a decade.  Do you have any more
information on this project?  Thanks for your input.</a>

<p>
Glen Finney
