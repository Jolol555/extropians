From: "Michael S. Lorrey" &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;

<p>
<a href="0648.html#0713qlink1">&gt;I'm also pro-choice, not because I don't think that the fetus is</a><br>
<i>&gt;a living creature, I think it is, but by all international norms,</i><br>
<i>&gt;a human being must be a citizen of either a country or a visitor</i><br>
<i>&gt;from a UN Human Rights Treaty signatory country, or from a country</i><br>
<i>&gt;has diplomatic relations with the country we are talking about to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be considered to have rights. Under no national or international</i><br>
<i>&gt;law is citizenship conferred on an individual according to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;nation in which the individual was conceived in. They all make</i><br>
<i>&gt;birth the condition of citizenship. Thus the unborn have no rights</i><br>
<i>&gt;under any accepted national or international convention. Here in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the US, under the 9th and 10th amendments, any rights not</i><br>
specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights were to
<br>
<a href="0648.html#0713qlink2">&gt;remain in the hands of the people, or in the states as delegated</a><br>
<i>&gt;by the people. </i><br>

<p>
I agree completely.


<p>
<a name="0727qlink1"><a href="0648.html#0713qlink3">&gt;So here, the various states can pass laws or state constitutional</a><br>
<i>&gt;amendments which regulate abortion and remain entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt;constitutional on all levels. It is their right to do so, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;right of people in the states to put such amendments up to state</i><br>
<i>&gt;referendums.</i><br>

<p>
NO!! The state has no more right to pass laws on non-citizens than
does the federal government. This does not stop them however.

<p>
<a href="0648.html#0713qlink4">&gt;If a state wishes to pass an amendment putting the rights of the</a><br>
<i>&gt;unborn ahead of the rights of the mother, then so be it.</i><br>
</a>
<p>
I disagree completely.
