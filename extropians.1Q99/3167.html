<a href="3166.html#3167qlink1">&gt;  Consider extending your description: retinal painting *and* three multimode</a><br>
<i>&gt;  cameras (binocular from you, plus a face shot); and five sound</i><br>
<i>&gt;  channels--binaural to you ("headphones" based on Wolf Ear tech, but made</i><br>
<i>&gt;  failsafe), binaural(those "wolf ears" again) + close-mike from you. The</i><br>
<i>&gt;  retinal sprayers might look like Ant Man mandibles and sit over your eyes</i><br>
<i>&gt;  only as much as a classic Plantronics Starset sits over your mouth. OK so </i><br>
<i>&gt;  far?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3235qlink1">	yea, i grok the part about the lightweight and unintrusive retinal
projecters, but what about the wolf ear jazz? thats a new term for me... ill
search for stuff</a> on it.

<p>
<a name="3235qlink2"><a href="3166.html#3167qlink2">&gt;  I also want 24/7 record capability with "911"-style parallel</a><br>
<i>&gt;  playback-while-record for all channels. That's SMOPD. Ana-Digi cellphone</i><br>
<i>&gt;  with silent cuing? Naturalamente.</i><br>

<p>
	i agree; setting this stuff up wouldnt be a big problem.  might make the
whole video-phone field of ideas finally take off...</a> 

<p>
<a href="3166.html#3167qlink3">&gt;  The rest of your stuff about [not] "needing" I/O devices seems muddled to</a><br>
me.

<p>
	i was saying that youd have all the i/o devices we have (and lots
more/better) with our current pc setup.  basicly, running and using a
currently avalible os (yea, this is shooting low) would be quite doable with
the retinal/headphone/mic combo, plus maybe a pointing device.  

<p>
<a name="3235qlink3"><a href="3166.html#3167qlink4">&gt;  Trackballs drift; I'd suggest a Cat trackpad.</a><br>

<p>
	never heard of the cat trackpad. ill look around tho.</a>

<p>
<a href="3166.html#3167qlink5">&gt;  I consider the following to be a partial list of things that would be handy</a><br>
<i>&gt;  when I'm trying to move about in the world:</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Proximity detection fields (spare eyes &amp; ears) so I can subcontract my</i><br>
<i>&gt;  attention if I am willing to risk it. Realtime orientation and location</i><br>
<i>&gt;  data, both center-of-mass and head tracking (twelve degrees of freedom);</i><br>
<i>&gt;  somthing that can pass for force feeback (which probably won't actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;  *be* force feedback, but can be learned by those motivated) --either</i><br>
<i>&gt;  vibratory or galvanic or both; and gestural, voice tone, vital sign and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  postural tracking and input. Many of these could possibly be based on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  video&amp;laser technology or ubiquitous computing. Some could be built into a</i><br>
<a name="3235qlink4"><i>&gt;  vest or shirt yoke today. Some are being prototyped for the military right</i><br>
<i>&gt;  now.</i><br>

<p>
	yea, ive heard rumors to that effect. got any references for me to mull?
</a>

<p>
<a href="3166.html#3167qlink6">&gt;  And there's always Morse code in extremis, and no, I'm not joking.</a><br>

<p>
	yup, theres always that. then there was that onehanded sign language
developed a few weeks ago specificly to communicate with machines...

<p>
" / FNORD / can you read between the lines?"
