<p>
<a name="1291qlink1">What makes this interesting is that this idea may imply that we are just
extremely lucky to have gotten as far as we have, and would help to explain
the seeming lack of successful galaxy colonizers coming in towards us from
intergalactic distances. Notice, though, that this by itself doesn't seem so
helpful for explaining why we haven't seen any ET's starting a wave of
colonization from relatively nearby locations within our galaxy. Presumably,
any nearby settlement-wave builders would benefit just as much from the
absence of a galaxy-wide catastrophe as we apparently have.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1103.html#1288qlink2">&gt;I would like to hear Robin Hanson's take on this new theory.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>


<p>
One article of Hanson's, "The Great Filter -- Are We Almost Past It", is an
interesting rundown of some of the other, more local obstacles that could get
in the way of evolution, and help to account for a seeming dearth of ET's. If
we've just narrowly escaped being killed off by a lot of Nature's "filters",
and that's the reason why no ET's, it could make a lot of sense to add this
galaxy-wide GRB filter to the list of things that can go wrong. It certainly
seems a discouraging theme for SETI searchers, though, unless there's some
reason why planet-bound ET's would be a lot more likely to survive, to then
beam their radio messages at us? Maybe large planets with dense atmospheres
naturally shield their inhabitants from radiation much better, while those
large-sized planetary gravity wells prevent most surviving ET's from getting
into space?

<p>
<a name="2766qlink1"><a name="1291qlink2">Since Robin Hanson has been mentioned, maybe this would be a good time to ask
a question about *another* ET article of his, "Burning the Cosmic Commons:
Evolutionary Strategies for Interstellar Colonization".</a> This article presents
a novel approach to the lack of ET's by saying that they could perhaps have
gone right *past* our intersteller locality, missing us, and our solar system
*completely* in a hasty "rush" of an expansion wave. In this scenario the
resources they need to expand rapidly have somehow been used up, so presumably
star systems fairly near to us might be depleted in whatever-it-is that they
need to keep their civilization going?<a name="2766qlink2"> Supposedly, they've never returned from
that great expansion wave front, figuring that our locality is used up, or
burnt out, so in this concept *that's* why no obvious ET settlements!</a>

<p>
My question here, is whether this abstract "Burning the Commons" concept, or
study, has any real meaning, in terms of the actual resource that would</a> be
<a name="2766qlink3">depleted? I mean, just what could possibly be so important that it would get
used up, and prevent really expansive ET's from gradually expanding into all
available niches, including our solar system? For instance, one "life
essential" resource that comes to my mind is *phosphorus*, but I can't imagine
why phosphorus atoms would actually be destroyed by ET settlers? Actually, I
suppose that's two questions: first, any reason why nearby ET's couldn't be
communicative, but planet-bound, and, second, what's burned in the "Burning
the Commons" scenario?
