It's tough to recommend just one or a couple of pieces.  From the instrumental
music, I'd recommend "Hot Rats" from the end of his early period and "Jazz
<br>
<i>&gt;From Hell" from his later period.  The vocal music varies from light to heavy</i><br>
satire, and as has been pointed out, some of it is pretty rough.  I personally
think "One Size Fits All" is the best, with the songs "Inca Roads" (spoof on
new age and UFO BS) and "Sofa" (spoof on German metaphysical philosophy --
there's not much rock that lampoons Kant) being two of the funniest and most
sophisticated pieces of vocal music of the age.
