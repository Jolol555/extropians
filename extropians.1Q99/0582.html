From: "Michael S. Lorrey" &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;

<p>
<i>&gt;I look at criminals as a natural phenomenon of the urban economic</i><br>
<a href="0570.html#0582qlink1">&gt;ecosystem. Individuals that are denied skills or opportunity to</a><br>
<i>&gt;practice productive skills in the society will resort naturally to</i><br>
<i>&gt;predatory economics, being economically carnivorous upon the</i><br>
<i>&gt;assets of the members of the herd. It does not matter if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;predator is an Ivan Boesky or John Dillinger, it is the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;behavior. Just as with natural predators, criminals will develop</i><br>
<i>&gt;a 'drug of choice' or preferred form of prey, which is why most</i><br>
<i>&gt;criminals only practice one or two forms of crime.</i><br>

<p>
I don't see this as purely economic, nor is it a matter of being
denied skills or opportunity. I see it as primarily cultural, it is
not mere coincidence that these levels of violence are prevalent in
certain subcultures (neighborhoods). It doesn't take a genius to
spot a gang-banger, it takes a clear head and a certain amount of
gut's to do something about it, especially if it's your kid.


<p>
<a href="0570.html#0582qlink2">&gt;Violent crime is similarly a form of repressed predation. Since in</a><br>
<i>&gt;an urban environment, there is no other species besides humans,</i><br>
<i>&gt;dogs, cats, and rats, you will get sociopathic individuals who</i><br>
<i>&gt;will express their natural hunting urges first upon 'acceptable'</i><br>
<i>&gt;species to prey upon, then marginally acceptable/unacceptable</i><br>
<i>&gt;species (dogs and cats), then as the individual becomes more</i><br>
<i>&gt;dislocated from society, they may prey upon the unacceptable prey</i><br>
<i>&gt;species, humans. This progression is a visible indication of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;progression of their mental illness, but the hunting urge is not</i><br>
<i>&gt;the illness, merely how the illness expresses itself in an</i><br>
<i>&gt;environment of a limited ecosystem.</i><br>

<p>
I don't see any repression, this is clearly predator/prey behavior.


<p>
<a href="0570.html#0582qlink3">&gt;This is one reason why I view the general urban/vegetarian fear of</a><br>
<i>&gt;guns and gun owners as also an instinctual fear that the herbivore</i><br>
<i>&gt;has for the carnivore. We as humans also have this instinct, which</i><br>
<i>&gt;comes to the fore as we practice a vegetarian lifestyle, since we</i><br>
<i>&gt;did evolve from vegetarian/scavengers who were preyed upon by many</i><br>
<i>&gt;predators, including homo erectus, and the great cats. This fear,</i><br>
<i>&gt;when it becomes the core of mental illness, is manifested in</i><br>
<i>&gt;haplophobia, which is recognized in the literature as an</i><br>
<i>&gt;irrational fear of guns. It is an illness of transference, as we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have a natural fear of seeing the natural weapons of predators</i><br>
<i>&gt;exhibited.</i><br>

<p>
I think you have a good point here. Prey species do not want any
non-prey species about.

<p>
<a name="0590qlink1">Here in Chicago we are going through a new round of brain dead
haplophobia. Despite 17 years of handguns being totally illegal
(except if you're a Chicago politician, can you spot hypocrisy?) we
were just named murder capitol of the U.S. They can't get it
through their heads they are approaching this the wrong way.

<p>
The answer? Simple, mandatory jail time (at least a year, I'd
prefer 5 let's settle on 3) for possession of an illegal handgun.</a> 


<p>
<a href="0570.html#0582qlink4">&gt;When attacked, a herbivore will tend to flee, while an omnivore</a><br>
<i>&gt;will tend to stand and fight, which explains the whole debate over</i><br>
<i>&gt;right-to-carry vs. no-right-to-carry concealed weapons, as it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;merely a manifestation of the different viewpoints of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;herbivorous (sublimated as an economic herbivore or as</i><br>
<i>&gt;an actual vegetarian) humans who prefer to avoid and flee and that</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the omnivorous humans who would prefer to stand and fight a</i><br>
<i>&gt;predator, and would prefer to be equally matched to that predator</i><br>
<i>&gt;in weaponry. Herbivorous humans, as herd creatures, will depend</i><br>
<i>&gt;upon the 'tamed' few deviants they think they have control</i><br>
<i>&gt;of (i.e. police/government) to protect them from the predators,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but will also seek to disarm the omnivores due to misplaced</i><br>
<i>&gt;association with the predators.</i><br>

<p>
Fight, flight or for most urbanites, just plain fright.


<p>
Fighter, not a flight-er.
