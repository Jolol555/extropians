&lt;&lt;Is that really the best first step? While it would be fun to have a
Omega Point Study Institute, its utility might be rather low at first
- all the necessary research is being done by ordinary scientists, the
only thing OP-theoreticians need to do is to gather together the
latest knowledge in cosmology, computation and robotics. Once we get
to the stage where launching replicating probes and such becomes
feasible, *then* the OPSI would become important in directing the
debate about the project.

grants to research targeted at this project.
