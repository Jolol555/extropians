  IAN: A 747 without a forward section is not a 747, 
  it's a wreak. I posit, though I know its not a popular 
  view, that an the opened cavity of the interior fuselage 
  of FLT800 would act like a massive airbreaking parachute, 
  like those the Shuttle deploys, which I propose is why 
  they give the opposite shape to the noses of aircraft.
  To apply the aerodynamics of a normal 747 to the wreak 
  that was FLT800 seems absurd to me, but the CIA says 
  it rose 5 times faster than the book-value climb rate, 
  and over twice the maximum operational climb rate, and
  that seems to be overwhelming evidence to most people.

<p>
  I suspect if the CIA did a video that said pigs could 
  fly I'd be here battling it out, arguing that they can't. 
  Oh ya, they DID make a video that says "pigs" can fly and 
  I am here battling it out. Life is stranger than fiction!

<p>
  Speaking of gliders, Tim, what about if the nose 
  was chopped off it! Check out this glider with 
  no nose, what happens to it when it comes off?:

  Granted there are scaling issues, but the overall 
  physics involved gives us a reliable indicator.
