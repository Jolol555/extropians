Because people would probably want to get out of the cities with problems 
to places which don't have them.

Particularly if you have a stock of generators to rent out too...

After the IRS, the military are the most likely to lie about compliance. The
last report I saw on their progress said they'd made great progress in only
a couple of months. However, reading the fine print you discovered that
they had made that progress primarily by redefining hundreds of mission
critical systems as no longer mission critical, and claiming other systems
were compliant without testing. Not good.

I still like the IBM research lab where a friend used to work; they have
or had a Concorde jet engine in the basement which could generate megawatts
if the power went out.
