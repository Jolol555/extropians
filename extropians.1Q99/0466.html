<p>
Okay, I think that's fine. If you take "atheism" as an ism, then it
requires a positive belief. My main concern was to note that it's just as
legitimate to define "atheism" as simply "lack of belief in a god". Can we
agree that it can be reasonably defined both ways?

<p>
<a href="0436.html#0466qlink2">&gt;&gt; I can't agree. "Gnosis" is definitely related to knowledge. The common</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; usage is "someone who isn't sure whether there is a god". The Dictionary of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Philosophy says: agnosticism 1. The belief (a) that we cannot have</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; knowledge of God and (b) that it is impossible to prove that God exists or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; does not exist. Gnosis relates to knowledge, not belief.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But you just cited a definition that begins "The belief ..."! Thus an </i><br>
<i>&gt;agnostic is not one without knowledge, but one who believes either </i><br>
<i>&gt;(a) or (b).</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0536qlink2">You might define "communism" as "the belief that all property should be
owned in common and not individually". Would that mean that communism was
all about belief?</a> The definitions of agnosticism above make *knowledge* the
issue, not belief. It's a belief about whether theological issues are
within the purview of knowledge.

<p>
Two points which might help explain why I hold to the view that agnosticism
is about one's views on what is knowable and not about the content of a
belief:

<p>
Taking atheism in its more general sense "lack of belief", then I think one
can be an atheist and an agnostic at the same time. This would be someone
who they cannot know one way or the other about the existence of a god, and
who therefore does not believe. (They would not, if consistent, also deny
the existence of such a being, though they might think it unlikely, but be
unable to show it unlikely enough to constitute knowledge of non-existence.)

<p>
More controversially, I think one could be a theist and an agnostic. This
would be someone who beliefs, but admits that they do not know, at least in
any normal sense of "know" that they would apply to anything else. They
might say they "have faith" without claiming this to be a special form of
knowledge. While being both a theist and an agnostic is logically
consistent (though irrational), it's probably not common. That's because to
admit that you believe without having knowledge is likely to make you
realize you're being unreasonable. Instead, most theists insist that their
"faith" is really some special foundation for knowledge--such as through
religious experience, etc.

<p>
<a href="0436.html#0466qlink3">&gt;&gt; definition, which I think did elsewhere. An agnostic is one who thinks that</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; they do not or cannot know whether there is a god. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, that is correct.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Whether you are an agnostic or atheist about any specific god depends on</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; your view of what's required before you think you know something. I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; equate knowledge with certainty, which is why I call myself an atheist and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; not an agnostic, at least when we're talking about the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Christian/Islamic/Jewish God.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In that sense I am likewise an atheist.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0536qlink3">Okay, so I don't we disagree about very much! Probably just the issue of
whether agnosticism is about knowledge or belief.</a> I'm not going to dig into
that further, since it will take us deep into the swamps of epistemology!
