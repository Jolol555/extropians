James P. Hogan addressed this topic once I beleive in one of his novels.  I
can't remember the title off hand but it was the first of his Titan (?)
<br>
"Robot" novels.  I beleive there may have been two.<br>

At any rate.  His suggestion (as conveyed by his character) was that immunity
to "kookiness" ...or skepticism....was best acquired by teaching
children............magic.

<p>
Stage magic.  Slieght of hand.  Smoke and mirrors.

<p>
The logic is that when children see that they CAN be fooled...then they are
much more careful to NOT be fooled.

<p>
It makes sense to me.
