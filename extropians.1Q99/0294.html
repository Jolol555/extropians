<i>&gt;A personal anecdote RE Frank Zappa: In my years in Seattle, I was roomates</i><br>
for a
<br>
<i>&gt;year or so with a guy who owned a limo business, and frequently drove for</i><br>
him
<br>
<i>&gt;(usually in the middle of the night for airport runs when he couldn't get</i><br>
<i>&gt;another driver). Once he picked up Frank Zappa at Sea-Tac airport and drove</i><br>
him
<br>
<i>&gt;downtown to the Olympic Hotel. As they passed through the financial</i><br>
district,
<br>
<i>&gt;Frank was sticking his head out the window yelling up at the skyscrapers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;yelling,"You capitalist bastards!!!" (it was around 11pm). This from a guy</i><br>
<i>&gt;paying $100 an hour for a limo, who flew first class and was staying at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;presidential suite at the Olympic Hotel, and was playing to several sold</i><br>
out
<br>
<i>&gt;crowds while in town.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0434qlink1">It's possible that by capitalist, he meant people who's only definition of
good was capital - ie those who worship money rather than using it as a
means to an end.  I'm very happy to use money as a means to an end and as a
useful tool and abstract concept.  I have a strong dislike of people to whom
the only good is money.
