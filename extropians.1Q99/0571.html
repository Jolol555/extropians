While voters around the nation decree that sick people

Libertarians blast Congress for spending 
$23 million to develop anti-drug killer fungus

<p>
        WASHINGTON, DC -- The United States government is spending $23
million to develop a killer fungus to wipe out marijuana plants -- a
dangerous plan that could cause an environmental catastrophe, said the
Libertarian Party today.

<p>
        "This project is the political equivalent of athlete's foot<br>
fungus: It's nasty, it's dangerous, and it needs to be stopped before
it spreads," said LP National Director Steve Dasbach. "The last thing
we need is a bio-engineered killer fungus turned loose on the world."

<p>
        Late last year, Congress passed legislation that authorized $23
million for research into soil-borne fungi called "mycoherbicides,"
which will attack and kill marijuana plants, poppy plants, and coca
plants.

<p>
        When developed, the fungus could be released in such South
American countries as Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, said U.S. officials.

<p>
        The legislation was guided through Congress by U.S.
Representatives Bill McCollum (R-FL) and Mike DeWine (R-OH), who said
the killer fungus was potentially a "silver bullet" in the War on
Drugs.

<p>
        But Libertarians say the tax-subsidized fungus is a "biohazard"
that could have a disastrous impact on the ecosystems of the target
nations -- and, potentially, the whole world.

<p>
        "In the government's irresponsible search for a quick-fix in<br>
the War on Drugs, politicians could cause terrifying long-term
ecological problems," warned Dasbach. According to scientists, the
killer fungus could...


<UL>
  <li>  Attack other plants, wiping out valuable cash crops.


</UL>
<p>
        "For example, a chemical alkaloid similar to the one that<br>
produces cocaine is present in many legal plants -- including tobacco
and coffee beans," said Dasbach. "In an effort to wipe out drugs, this
killer fungus could wipe out the livelihood of millions of farmers."


<UL>
  <li>  Cause many plants to develop stronger chemical defenses
against the fungus, which could then mutate and spread to other,
harmful plants.


</UL>
<p>
        "According to scientists, mutated plants could pass on these<br>
resistant genes and create herbicide-resistant weeds, which could have
a ruinous effect on farm yields," he said. "With world hunger already a
problem, why risk making it worse?"


<UL>
  <li>  Wipe out industrial hemp plants, which are legal in every
major industrialized country outside the United States.


</UL>
<p>
        "No fungus is smart enough to tell the difference between legal<br>
hemp and illegal marijuana," noted Dasbach. "This fungus could be the
biological warfare equivalent of carpet bombing -- killing whatever is
in its path."

<p>
        What should Americans do about this dangerous program? Tell
their Congressional representatives to apply a strong dose of political
fungicide to "cure" it, said Dasbach.

<p>
        "This tax-funded fungus should be treated like any dangerous<br>
mold or mildew -- exposed to sunlight and wiped clean. Congress should
just say no to biological warfare."

<p>
        Dasbach also said Libertarians have a better way to reduce the
consumption of marijuana, with no environmental risks: Legalize it.

<p>
        In the Netherlands, he noted, where marijuana is
decriminalized, drug use is half that of the United States. In fact, a
new study revealed that while 32.9% of Americans have tried marijuana,
only 15.6% of Dutch adults have done so.

<p>
        "Treating adults like adults -- and letting them make decisions<br>
about how to live their lives -- seems to have a stronger anti-drug
effect than any killer fungus," said Dasbach. "Wouldn't it be ironic if
liberty was a more effective anti-drug program than deadly
mycoherbicides?"
