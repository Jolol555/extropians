Ok.
<br>
If I put some heat energy into a thing, then it expands. This is true, right?
The heat energy is coming from some other source - say I am heating water.</a>
I am providing lit gas underneath the water's vessel. So it expands with
the heat energy in it. Now it is expanded. Now it has the heat energy in
it. The energy starts slipping from it: when it cools, it gets compressed
ie it loses its expansion. Once it's cooler, it's less expanded.
We know this from practical experience. Introducing heat energy into a
simple system such as a pot of water expands all involved as it gets hotter.

<p>
If the universe is expanding, then the process of being heated hasn't been
completed yet, in which case it is still getting hotter. If it has
expanded, then the process of being heated has finished, and it will cool
(lose heat energy and start un-expanding or in my language - compressing)

<p>
By stating "the UNIVERSE" is expanding, it would follow that the whole
thing is expanding. The earth is included in this.

<p>
My question is - if it IS expanding, where is the energy coming from to do
this - outside of the universe if we're looking at our example. As I can't
comprehend what the universe is, I can't comprehend something that's endless.
