The Voyage
<br>
<a name="3713qlink1">In this sailing ship of ours, navigating in the Sea of the Unknown for two
millenia, in a voyage of discover of ourselves, our creator and our</a> purpose in
<a name="3713qlink2">life, the navigation stars are fading.

<p>
The elite of the crew no longer looks at the stars, knowing that we</a> are nothing
<a name="3713qlink3">more than ‘a temporary collection of recycled carbon compounds</a> occupying space
<a name="3713qlink4">in a huge and unfeeling universe’.  They finally understood that life is an
accidental byproduct of matter - a mistake of Nature, in the sense that
consciousness (the metaphorical Tree of Knowledge) is nothing but</a> the capacity
<a name="3713qlink5">to understand and fear our physical and metaphysical misfortunes, and that
there is no purpose in life except the one that we make</a> for ourselves during
<a name="3713qlink6">the short cycles of our existences.

<p>
But the rest of the crew, the great majority, is stuck in the inertia</a> of 2000
<a name="3713qlink7">years of old habits of belief, constantly haunted</a> in the unconscious labyrinths
<a name="3713qlink8">of the collective psyches with the nightmare that there is no</a> creator - besides
<a name="3713qlink9">the whole process of evolution - and therefore no hope for life</a> after death.

<p>
<a name="3713qlink10">The ship will go on sailing, until it sinks or finds a friendly</a> utopic harbor,
<a name="3713qlink11">where we can enjoy our short existences, without illusions</a> of divine origins,
<a name="3713qlink12">and get out in a easy and dignified way.
