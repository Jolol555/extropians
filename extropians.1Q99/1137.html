<a name="1149qlink1">My fear is this, that if we are brought back. I may end up in the 
likeness of a clone. If neurons are damaged beyond repairs, quickly 
after death. Then, the memories are gone, correct? So even upon 
retrieval, I'm a copy without knowledge of who I was. In a sense, I'll 
still be dead.</a> After every thing I've had to learn this life go round, I 
don't want it all lost. There must be an alternative. And also how do 
you see the future cryonics organizations doing this, if we've only paid 
for our frozen state?

a way thats/he fits the (subjective) image that others have of this 
person, but this is of course of little use to the original.
