suspiciously similar to the core of Scientologist thinking...similar to
Mormonism but with science as the bait.  As much as I am open to other
people's views, I have heard the same pseudo-friendly suggestive statements
time and time again, and all they seem to lead to is the recruitment of
otherwise intelligent people to a religion-based world view.  Augmenting the
face of God still requires a God in the first place.  Be wary.

No offense, Shaun?  What's with this "pseudo-friendly" descriptor?  Is this
another meme?  Because a girl broke my heart, does that mean that all people
with high voices, great hair and dresses will do likewise?  

<p>
What is the core of Scientologist thinking and Mormanism?
