Hi!

<p>
<a name="0916qlink1">I'd like to know your opinion about a couple of ideas I had. If you have
already mentioned them before, I'm sorry.

<p>
<a name="0934qlink1">I've been thinking that in a not so far away future humanity will be ruled
by a small number of men, computers or hybrids of both. The argument is
that economical power is becoming more concentrated as time goes by, when
the technology to control humans -- either by brain implants, highly
developed subliminal messages or military force -- arrives, someone is
bound to use</a> it. We had Hitler, Napoleon, Caesar, Alexander and many more;
why shouldn't Bill Gates use this to control humankind. Most politicians
are power fanatics that will individually control humankind if they're
given the technology.</a>

<p>
The other idea is far simpler. Don't you enjoy classifying technological
capacity of a civilization by the precision and ability of atomic
manipulation? We began by having a chemical industry, we are working with
cells' organelles to increase our molecular manipulation skills, we will
have nanotechnology and as nanotechnology develops, the more powerful
computers we'll have and the more molecular modeling we'll be able to do
thus leading to an evolution in nanotechnology the cycle will begin once
again.

<p>
Anyway, just a couple of thoughts.
