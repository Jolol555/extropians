Thank you for retracting your original statement.  That debate is dead meat

Every so often, one of the memes left over from my Judeo-Christion
indoctrination rears its ugly head and says "hey looky here, you forgot to
delete me".  Any of us who were indoctrinated and who claim to have been
fully inoculated are only fooling ourselves.  That meta meme complex is so
all encompasing, I doubt its parasitic effects can be fully wiped out short
of becoming posthuman.  OTOH there are a few beningn or even beneficial
memes I've purposely kept.

<p>
For sucurity reasons, I believe most of us will need to upload well before
we feel totally secure about the process.  Meat is very vulnerable. 
Mutiple backups in scattered physical locations will probably be a luxery
we cannot afford to do without.  For this reason, I think Eliezer's meme
could very well become parisitic.
