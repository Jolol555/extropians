<a href="1929.html#1938qlink1">&gt; I found the following on James T. Hogan's (the science fiction author)</a><br>
<i>&gt; website.  I'm kinda gratified that he addresses a subject that I brought</i><br>
<i>&gt; up (and was subsequently shot down on) some months ago.  However...his</i><br>
<i>&gt; questions are intriquing...and he's NOT just a truckdriver.</i><br>

<p>
Being a truck driver requires a basic understanding of physics lest
one flatten fellow travellers.  You're right, this Hogan is no truck
driver; he doesn't have that much understanding.

<p>
The calculations of required muscle mass for dinosaurs have been
done many times, and they work out just fine.  To contend otherwise
requires willful ignorance or outright dishonesty.  I especially
like the argument that "no evidence exists for the high-pressure
circulation system...", in the same paragraph with the statement
that "they are all digestive system."  Soft tissue does not
fossilize; the evidence for one is exactly the same as the evidence
for the other: inference.  Honesty requires that if you reject one
of these hypotheses, you must reject both.  To accept slim evidence
that supports your point while rejecting equal or stronger evidence
that does not is the same basic dishonesty of all creationists,
medical quacks, and other crackpots like Velikovsky.

<p>
Here's an experiment: he states at the end of the paragraph that
"more information on this is welcome...".  Send him some that
disproves his point (the /real/ muscle mass calculations, for
example).  I'll bet you a day's pay it won't be so welcome that
he'll post it next to his piece, or remove his piece as refuted.
