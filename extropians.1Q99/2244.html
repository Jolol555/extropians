spike noted that

<i>&gt;So now if you are caught driving drunk in New York City, you</i><br>
<a href="2241.html#2244qlink1">&gt;get your car impounded.  If you are acquitted, you might *still*</a><br>
<i>&gt;lose your car!  Today's San Jose Mercury quotes Mayor Giuliani:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Let's say somebody is acquitted, and it's one of those acquittals</i><br>
<i>&gt;in which the person is guilty, but there is just not quite enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence beyond a reasonable doubt," the mayor said.  "That might</i><br>
<i>&gt;be a situation in which the car would still be forfeited."</i><br>

This guy is about the only reason (IMHO) that Hillary Clinton has a dog's 
show of being elected as a senator for the great state of NY.

I used this as a sig for a short time (maybe i inherited from this list?)

  "Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of 
  every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal
  of discretion about what you do and how you do it."

  "State authority must provide for peace and order, and peace and 
  order in turn must conversely make possible the existence of state 
  authority. Within these two poles all life must now revolve...
  Ideas of 'freedom', mostly of a misunderstood nature, inject
  themselves into  the state conceptions of these circles".
