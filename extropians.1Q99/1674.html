<p>
It might be more valuable once there is an industry that can
use the raw materials, but right now I think that the roton is more
valuable as a vehicle than as raw materials.  

<p>
Notice, as well, that the target price for the roton is 2.2k$/kg, 
less than half of the price you mention.  Cost is the major factor
for many industries...
