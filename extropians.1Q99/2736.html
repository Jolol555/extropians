Harvey Newstrom &lt;newstrom@newstaffinc.com&gt; maybe answered:
<br>
<i>|</i><br>
<a href="2680.html#2736qlink1">|1.  ExI claimed in the welcome message that the list would be run as a</a><br>
<i>|living example of Anarchy and PPL (Privately Produced Law).  Everyone</i><br>
<i>|would be self-governed.  Anyone could start or join any PPL they wished.</i><br>
<i>|Disputes would be handled by negotiation between the PPLs.  In reality</i><br>
<i>|ExI was not prepared to forgo any ownership authority over the list.  We</i><br>
<i>|therefore had the awkward experience of trying to have anarchy</i><br>
<i>|controlled by a central authority, and self-rule as individually granted</i><br>
<i>|by the list owner.</i><br>

<p>
Enlightened despotism, then.  Deimos ruled by Aristos.

<p>
<a href="2680.html#2736qlink2">|2. ExI did not have any procedures in place to allow PPLs.  When a</a><br>
<i>|trusted friend of ExI declared himself to be the first PPL, he was met</i><br>
<i>|with full ExI approval.  When some unknown newcomers tried to declare</i><br>
<i>|themselves as PPLs, they were disallowed.  When the unknown newcomers</i><br>
<i>|asked for the reasons they were denied and for procedures for getting</i><br>
<i>|approved, it turned out that the procedures hadn't been invented yet.</i><br>
<i>|Worse, when ExI tried to define the procedures, it became clear that</i><br>
<i>|self-rule would only be allowed with ExI approval, and that PPLs could</i><br>
<i>|only exist under ExI control.  Although this is perfectly reasonable for</i><br>
<i>|the list owner to assert, it ruined the experiment of demonstrating</i><br>
<i>|anarchy and PPL without central control.</i><br>

<p>
Interesting. I have seen the same problem pop up in other anarchy like groups.
The friendly anarchy theory breaks down in the face of harsh reality.

<p>
The PPL idea seemed such a nice idea when I read about it in those days.
Too bad it never became implemented.  Did ExI identify it as a resource hog?

<p>
One might divide the monolithic ExI list into a decentralized group of
smaller lists, each under its own PPL (much like replacing a monolithic
one world government with a number of small city states).  The ExI list
could in that scenario be used as a central hub where the supporters of
the different PPLs could discuss, communicate and iron out their bilateral
differences of opinion.

<p>
Naturally such an implementation would require some loss of control and
power for the ExI, which then might decide against it on those grounds.

<p>
Maybe one could experiment the PPL idea in a safe sand box environment?

<p>
Just a thought.  Comments?

<p>
<a href="2680.html#2736qlink3">|Since the developing rules for anarchy had the same appeal as</a><br>
<i>|Price-fixing the stock market to keep it stable, most people who wanted</i><br>
<i>|to see the experiment lost interest.  Less interested people didn't care</i><br>
<i>|and just wanted a discussion list.  Finally, I think there was unanimous</i><br>
<i>|consent that ExI should just run the list as they saw fit, and that</i><br>
<i>|anyone who wanted self-rule could start their own list.</i><br>

<p>
When one removes the opposition one easily gets unanimous consent.
