<i>&gt;No need for a physics book. It is rather simple. If you cannot concede this</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;a body is moving forward in flight at 400 mph. It suddenly changes its</i><br>
angle of
<br>
<a href="2106.html#2110qlink2">&gt;attack to a negative orientation, as it stalls out, losing upward lift. This</a><br>
<i>&gt;does not mean that it is no longer moving forward at all. A plane can easily</i><br>
<i>&gt;stall out at any speed. Stalling is the loss of laminar flow resulting in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;loss of lift to support a vehicle in flight, which results most easily from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;vehicle being at an extreme angle of attack (more than 20 or 30 degrees).</i><br>
When
<br>
<a href="2106.html#2110qlink3">&gt;the vehicle stalls out, its nose drops, and will frequently drop far below a</a><br>
<i>&gt;zero degree angle of attack. The plane will go into a dive, and the forward</i><br>
<i>&gt;velocity, acting on the negatively oriented lifting surfaces, generate</i><br>
lift in a
<br>
<a href="2106.html#2110qlink4">&gt;DOWNWARD direction, thus accelerating the vehicle downward at a rate greater</a><br>
<i>&gt;than that cause merely by gravity.</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: Mike, you're spouting nonsense. You've 
<a name="2138qlink1">  explained how negative lift can occur but NOT 
  how negative lift can accelerate an object from 
  0 vertical velocity to a fall rate faster then 
  the fall rate in a vacuum. Please explain how 
  negative lift</a> and accelerate an object faster
  than the same object dropped in a vacuum.


<p>
<a href="2106.html#2110qlink5">&gt;If you cannot understand this simple point I can scarcely understand how</a><br>
you can
<br>
<a href="2106.html#2110qlink6">&gt;make it through a day. I am sorry to everyone for the level of vitriol in my</a><br>
<i>&gt;post, but I have really reached the end of my patience with this idiocy.</i><br>
If Mr.
<br>
<a href="2106.html#2110qlink7">&gt;Goddard cannot understand matters of extremely simple aerodynamics then he is</a><br>
<i>&gt;scarcely someone who is even partially qualified to judge what happened to</i><br>
TWA
<br>

<p>
  IAN: Mike, do you still contend that the video
  says it was the nose that hit at 49 seconds first, 
  or can you not concede even one of your errors?
