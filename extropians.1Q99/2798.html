Recognizing bogosity requires some familiarity with the issue at hand.
Spike, you may know enough about satellites to have an informed opinion.
I certainly don't. That said...

<p>
How old is that satellite? What is involved in controlling it?

<p>
<a name="2833qlink1">A few years back, when I read about American phreaks re-programming the
switches of the telephone company, I was awed. What incredible abilities
must these people have to do something that should by all rights be
impossible? Well, my respect collapsed when I read _The Hacker
Crackdown_. The telcos had left maintenance modem ports on-line, without
password protection, and anybody who stumbled over the number could dial
in and--after figuring out the system from the online help or manuals
found in the trash dumpster at the telco's building--take control. No
extraordinary abilities required. How could anybody in his right mind be
so incredibly stupid to set such a system up?</a>

<p>
<a name="2833qlink2">So, maybe you only need to send a carrier on certain ("secret")
frequencies to control the satellite or some such thing? Something that
should be well in the ability of a radio amateur.</a>

<p>
<a name="2884qlink1">Also, it isn't required to do something meaningful with the satellite.
They just need to interfere with its operation.</a>
