Abstract
<br>
  In contrast to L-glutamine, lipid emulsions are routinely
  administered to patients receiving nutritional support. The provision of fat
  during intravenous feeding is essential, but the potentially toxic byproducts
  of fatty acid oxidation may have adverse metabolic consequences. In the
  present study, we have examined the effect of L-glutamine,
  an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, on the development of defective blood
  glucose regulation caused by a 48-hour infusion of 10% intralipid in rats.
  Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-290 g) were anesthetized with sodium
  pentobarbital, the right femoral vein cannulated, and baseline blood samples
  were taken. Each rat was placed in a metabolic cage with access to water, in
  the presence or absence of rodent chow. Two hours after waking, the rats were
  infused with 10% intralipid with either saline (control), 2%
  L-glutamine, or 2% L-alanine. After 48 hours, all animals
  were sacrificed and blood samples were again obtained. The mean +/- SEM
  plasma glucose levels before and after lipid infusion at the rate of 1 mL/hr
  in control rats fed ad libitum, were 125 +/- 13 and 170 +/- 5 mg/dL (p &lt;
  0.01, n = 7). Similarly, plasma free fatty acids (FFA) in these animals rose
  from 0.74 +/- 0.11 to 1.34 +/- 0.32 mmol/L (p &lt; 0.05). Plasma insulin levels
  also increased from 337 +/- 44 to 1278 +/- 88 pg/mL (p &lt; 0.01). Reduction of
  intralipid dose infusion did not prevent insulin resistance characterized by
  hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. However, addition of
  L-glutamine to the high-dose lipid infusion with chow
  feeding prevented changes in plasma glucose, insulin levels, and FFA but not
  triglyceride levels. Also, glutamine but not alanine
  supplementation in intralipid infused rats without chow
  feeding prevented changes in plasma glucose, insulin, and malondialdehyde
  levels. In conclusion, these data show that glutamine
  supplementation during intravenous lipid administration in
  rats prevents the development of impaired glucose regulation associated with
  hyperlipidemia.

Abstract
<br>
  C57BL/6J (B/6J) mice are genetically predisposed to become overweight and
  develop hyperglycemia if raised on a high fat diet. The purpose of the
  present study was to explore the effect of dietary
  supplementation of L-glutamine (Gln), an
  inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, on the development of hyperglycemia and
  excessive weight gain. Groups of 10 age- and weight-matched male B/6J mice
  were raised on one of four diets: 1) a low fat, low sucrose (LL), studied
  separately, 2) a high fat, low sucrose (HL) diet alone, 3) high fat, low
  sucrose supplemented with L-glutamine (HL+Gln) and 4) high
  fat, low sucrose supplemented with L-alanine (HL+Ala). Energy intake, body
  weight, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were monitored over time.
  We found no difference in energy intake per unit body weight between any
  groups after the first 2 wk of feeding. However, the mean +/- SEM for body
  weight (27.1 +/- 0.6 g) of the LL group measured at 16 wk was lower (P &lt;
  0.05) than that of the HL group at 37.9 +/- 1.9 g. Also, after 5.5 mo, the
  mean +/- SEM for plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in the LL group of
  mice were 6.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l and 146 +/- 30 pmol/l, which were lower (P &lt;
  0.05) than those in the HL group at 10.1 +/- 0.9 mmol/l and 438 +/- 84
  pmol/l, respectively. Although both amino acids caused a 10% reduction (P &lt;
  0.05) in body weight compared with HL feeding at wk 16, only Gln
  supplementation resulted in persistent reductions in both
  plasma glucose and insulin concentrations over 5.5 mo. In another experiment,
  when Gln was added to the high fat (HL) diet of heavy hyperglycemic animals
  for 2 mo, body weight gain, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia were
  attenuated. In conclusion, supplementing glutamine to a high fat diet reduces
  body weight and attenuated hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in B/6J mice.
