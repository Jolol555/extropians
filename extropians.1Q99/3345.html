Here's a way to do both: When a person reaches retirement age, they can be
offered double their benefits if they undergo suspension immediately. Thus you
remove an existing drain on the economy, deferring the liability and allowing
the invested assets to grow the economy to a point where all can live in
techno-paradise.

<i>&gt; &gt; humans compete for longer lives.</i><br>

<p>
All should live. As the assets of those under suspension accrue interest and
grow the economy and technology, the money will become available to develop mass
launching systems, terraforming of Mars, reviving everyone, and cheap nanotech
based health care and food production. The more people who are retired in
suspension, the less money is wasted by unproductive individuals lifestyles.
