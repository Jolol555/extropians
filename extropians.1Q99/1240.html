Mike, this is not a theoretical problem.  We, in Florida, are really
having a problem with effluent run-off killing coral.  If you think the
solution is easy, please enlighten us.  We have tons of run-off weekly,
and no one knows how to radically reduce it or change its composition.
How would solving this problem be easy?

<p>
You really believe that garbage naturally collects in the Gulf without
humans actually dumping garbage?  You really believe that anybody can
confuse natural oil seeps with spills of highly-refined petrolium
products?  You have been listening to too much Rush Limbaugh.  You
probably believe that El Nino and La Nina are liberal political
theories, and that NASA fakes its satellite data as part of the Clinton
criminal conspiracy.</a>

<a name="1286qlink3">Sorry, but I live and grew up in Florida.  I studied biology at Florida
Tech., and they specialize in Oceanography, performing a lot of work
around Florida.  None of the crack-pot theories you have cited are
heavily pushed in the scientific sector.<a name="1257qlink1">  I hear these kinds of theories
from Republicans more than Biologists.</a>
