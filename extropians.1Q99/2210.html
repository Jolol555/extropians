<p>
Apologies if you get this more than once.  I'm sending it only to
friends who are outside my usual channels for this sort of thing!

<p>
I'm participating in an Internet campaign to stop a regulation which
would require your bank to spy on you, and I'd like to invite you to
join me.

<p>
We now have less than 20 days to contact the FDIC and demand that it
kill its proposed "Know Your Customer" rule. Please forward this
message to any friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, or other
people you know personally who may be interested. Then go to
<a href="http://www.defendyourprivacy.com">http://www.defendyourprivacy.com</a> and sign the petition. It will be
submitted directly to the FDIC. Plus, a copy will be sent to your
representative in the U.S. House and to both your U.S. Senators.

<p>
The FDIC's Know Your Customer rule would force banks to "monitor" your
checking and savings account and report any "unusual transactions" to
the federal government. This frightening threat to your financial
privacy would force your bank to:


<UL>
  <li>  Discover your "source of funds"

  <li>  Determine your "normal and expected transactions"

  <li>  Report any "suspicious activity" to federal investigators


</UL>
<p>
The government claims it is trying to thwart money launderers and drug
dealers. But what this law will do is turn every bank teller into a
government informer and everyone with a bank account into a criminal
suspect.

<p>
In a free society, the government has no business asking where you get
your money or how you spend it -- and politicians have no right to
force your bank to monitor your account.

<p>
But that's exactly what's going to happen, unless we can generate
enough opposition before the FDIC's comment period expires on March 8.
Outraged Americans have already flooded the FDIC with over 15,000
comments against the Know Your Customer regulation -- but the agency
hasn't backed down yet.

<p>
Let's keep up the pressure.

<p>
Please forward this e-mail to everyone you know who might be interested
in helping, but please don't send it indiscriminately -- spam will only
hurt our campaign.

<p>
Then go to our web page (<a href="http://www.defendyourprivacy.com">http://www.defendyourprivacy.com</a>) and sign the
petition. Thank you.
