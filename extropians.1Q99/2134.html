<a href="2069.html#2134qlink1">&gt;&gt; Regarding non-tariff barriers for import...huh, Japan is not the only </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; country that does it. How about bananas and EC? And what about India </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with its against-patent regulations, and even US (regulations </i><br>
regarding 
<br>
<a href="2069.html#2134qlink2">&gt;&gt; textile and apparel products aimed against EC)?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Why is India the bad guy for not adopting the silly western idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;of patents?  It is /we/ who are restricting /their/ free trade in</i><br>
<i>&gt;information, not the other way around (unless perhaps the have</i><br>
<i>&gt;some internal patent system and deny only foreign patents, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't think that's the case).</i><br>

<p>
Who said 'bad'? But too clever - maybe.
<br>
Look, they haven't spend a dime on R&amp;D expenses, and they want a 
technology for free. Of course, westerners feel robbed off and offended, 
it is understandable. (Frankly, I don't care much about western world, 
but I definitely see their point :)
<br>
The firms that invented something did it in order to survive in the 
free-market competition, remember that pure egoism, and not humanitarian 
ideals back up the progress.
<br>
So, who said that there is a free cheese? Technology and information 
have some value too.
