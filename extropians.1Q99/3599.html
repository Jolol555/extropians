a liver in a tank is one thing, harvesting living human original or clone
bodies is murder.  The liver construction wouldn't necessarily have to be the
same as a natural human liver.

Funny.

<p>
Malthusian dilemna is that there are finite Earthly resources to support an
increasing, not to mention gluttonous, human population.  The solution to this
is research and development, which happens to also be the indicator of future
production increase, ie, the rate of research and develop funding is directly
and linearly correlated to future productivity increase, ie increasing sum
total social utility.

<p>
Prisoner's dilemna is the issue more relevant to this one, in that if any
person were to reach a state of absolute power whether they would remove any
conceived threats to their power would be an ethical choice.

<p>
Big space!
