No.  The most efficient means of traveling into the future is simply to
accelerate to relativistic speeds and let time dilation do its job. You will be
present for every instant between the now and the then, but your subjective rate
of passage will differ from the rest of the universe. If you travel back into
the past, well, its already there, or was there. If you create a wormhole into
the past you are just following a time-like curve back to an earlier point in
the topology. Traveling in reverse from the past end of the wormhole to the
future end, well, the topology is already there, you are following a timelike
curve to the new surface of the balloon in the future. Its not there now...
