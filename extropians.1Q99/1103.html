<i>&gt;&gt;EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE: January 20, 1999, 2 p..m. EST</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Cataclysmic Explosions May Have Held Up Alien Visitors</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;GAMMA-RAY bursts -- incredibly powerful explosions that may be caused</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;by collisions between collapsed stars -- could solve one of the oldest</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;riddles about extraterrestrial civilisations: why haven't they reached</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Earth already? After studying the effects of gamma-ray bursts on life,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;an astrophysicist has concluded that aliens may have just started to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;explore their galaxies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Enthusiasts for the existence of extraterrestrials have long been</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;haunted by a simple question supposedly posed by the Nobel prizewinning</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;physicist Enrico Fermi around 1950. Fermi pointed out that the Galaxy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;is about 100 000 light years across. So even if a spacefaring race</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;could explore the Galaxy at only a thousandth of the speed of light, it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;would take them just 100 million years to spread across the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Galaxy. This is far less than the Galaxy's age of about 10 billion</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;So if ETs exist in the Milky Way, where are they? Maybe they don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;share the human urge to explore. Or perhaps there's another reason,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;says James Annis, an astrophysicist at Fermilab near Chicago. He thinks</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;cataclysmic gamma-ray bursts often sterilise galaxies, wiping out life</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;forms before they have evolved sufficiently to leave their planet</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;(Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, vol 52, p 19). GRBs are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;thought to be the most powerful explosions in the Universe, releasing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;as much energy as a supernova in seconds. Many scientists think the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;bursts occur when the remnants of dead stars such as neutron stars or</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;black holes collide.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Annis points out that each GRB unleashes devastating amounts of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;radiation. "If one went off in the Galactic centre, we here two-thirds</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of the way out on the Galactic disc would be exposed over a few seconds</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to a wave of powerful gamma rays." He believes this would be lethal to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;life on land.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;The rate of GRBs is about one burst per galaxy every few hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;million years. But Annis says theories of GRBs suggest the rate was</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;much higher in the past, with galaxies suffering one strike every few</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;million years -- far shorter than any plausible time scale for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;emergence of intelligent life capable of space travel. That, says</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Annis, may be the answer to Fermi's question. "They just haven't had</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;enough time to get here yet," he says. "The GRB model essentially</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;resets the available time for the rise of intelligent life to zero each</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;time a burst occurs."</i><br>


<p>
Fascinating idea, but this is where I get lost.<a name="1177qlink1">  If the clock is
currently reset every few 100 million years,</a> how could we still be
here?  Hasn't life been evolving here for more than a couple billion
years now?

<p>
<a href="1095.html#1103qlink2">&gt;&gt;Paul Davies, a visiting physicist at Imperial College, London, says the</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;basic idea for resolving the paradox makes sense. "Any Galaxy-wide</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;sterilising event would do," he says. However, he adds that GRBs may be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;too brief: "If the drama is all over in seconds, you only zap half a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;planet. The planet's mass shields the shadowed side." Annis counters</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that GRBs are likely to have many indirect effects, such as wrecking</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ozone layers that protect planets from deadly levels of ultraviolet</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;radiation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Annis also highlights an intriguing implication of the theory: the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;current rate of GRBs allows intelligent life to evolve for a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;hundred million years before being zapped, possibly giving it enough</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;time to reach the spacefaring stage. "It may be that intelligent life</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;has recently sprouted up at many places in the Galaxy and that at least</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a few groups are busily engaged in spreading."</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1164qlink1">Huh?  If all lfe is destroyed by the GRB, _and_ life starts up again on
the planet, a few hundred million years isn't going to be enough
time for space faring levels of intelligence to arise, is it?

<p>
Surely this fact did not escape him.  So what aspect of his theory am
I not getting?</a>

<p>
<a name="2765qlink1"><a name="1177qlink2"><a name="1164qlink2">Besides, Jay Gould once stated that the contingency based character of
natural selection was such that if evolution were replayed millions of
times,
</a>
<br>
intelligence would not appear on the planet.  This was in stark contrast to
my up-till-then cherished theory that attributes such as increased levels
</a>
of awareness, neural comlexity, and consciousness would have good
<a name="1164qlink3">survival value.  Point being, Dr. Annis seems to assume that if life appears
on a planet, intelligent life is a highly</a> probably outcome.  Gould assumes
the opposite.

</a>
<p>
I happen to think there's a good chance that humans are quite alone.
In fact, I hope it's the case.  Even if another intelligence does exist and
comes across us, I seriously doubt it will be organic.  And I don't want us
to be found by an SI probe.

<p>
Anyone see the Babylon 5 episode where a probe appeared and gave the
commander a list of 100(?) questions and if they answered all 100 correctly,
it would not blow up and destroy the station because only the most
intelligent
<br>
species would be allowed to live?  Turns out the probe's true mission was to
destroy any species that succeeded.  Just another possible filter out there,
I guess.

<p>
<a name="1288qlink2">I would like to hear Robin Hanson's take on this new theory.</a>
