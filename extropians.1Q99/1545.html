we may be seeing just the tip of the iceberg of the spam problem.

lee daniel crocker used the analogy of the dish of free mints.  the
fate of those mints would be much different, depending on whether
it was located in the dining room of an upscale english country club
or alternately placed on the streetcorner of the poor section of
bombay.  hungry people could scarcely conceive any
logical reason not to devour every mint right on the spot.

altho the internet today is populated by the technosophisticated,
i expect it to go down-market as cheaper and simpler computers
and internet services become available.  this may cause the internet
to become populated by those who cannot imagine any reason
not to spam our brains out in the hope of earning a few ill-gotten
dollars.   dammit.  {8-[   spike
