tim,

<a name="3041qlink1">     I agree that there is a strong memetic aspect to the question of how</a> to
deal with alternate worldviews (specifically religions).  But I would suggest
that any religion is not a single meme, but a large and convoluted meme
complex, which has survived and evolved over many generations.  There are many
separate memes in a religion meme complex, many inter-related and some
contradictory; some of these memes are pretty good (by Extropian standards),
and others are terrible (by anyone's standards).  I recommend trying to
reinforce those positive memes and erode those negative memes, mostly through
reason and example.  Humanity has a thin veneer of reason which is hooked into
a rather advanced, emotion-driven, survival machine.  When dealing with those
who are not &gt;H, we need to take the initiative to provide a calm, safe,
reflective environment which fosters reason, tolerance, and understanding.  We
need to connect with those of other views to work together on shared memes of
values, and try to understand the basis of our differences.  This sounds all
warm and cuddly, but there is a pragmatic underpinning.  In my opinion,
everybody is a potential resource (me included) which can contribute to
growth.  Now, these resources can also be turned against growth.  I want to
maximize our support, ensure our freedom, and minimize our opposition.  Being
warm and cuddly is a good way to do that, especially when you are a new
minority, which at this point in history is what &gt;H are.  Current society is
barely aware of us, let alone sure how to deal with us.  This is a critical
point in the evolution of &gt;H; what we do and say over the next decade or so
will determine whether we will grow into an accepted way of life, or are
persecuted as a danger to society.  Personally, I want to tap into all that
potential out there in humanity, not have to fight it.  Turning against whole
meme complexes will trigger a memetic immune reaction which could set back the
<br>
<i>&gt;H meme complex by many years.  Instead, let us single out those few memes</i><br>
which corrupt and twist any other memes they come into contact with, such as
Absolutism, Infallibility, Intolerance, Genocide, etc.  Those I will be happy
to proclaim myself the enemy of, and to fight with all my might.
