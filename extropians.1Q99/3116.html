That was me most recently, though its been a frequent comment by many on the list.

<a name="3125qlink1">It is an excellent idea. The "Extropic Earth" movement in my opinion,</a> should work as a synergizer to
encourage industry to invest in such projects, perhaps it could push for such regs, where if, say
someone want to build a dam that threatens a species like the snail darter, they must construct
habitat for the species elsewhere to compensate, just as many developers do now with wetlands. I know
advocating government regs is anathema to most on the list, but it is how the current system works.
Trying to make one change is hard enough without trying to force everyone to make the change the way
you want them to. Suggestions?

<a name="3125qlink2">An idea I had for private species recovery would to possibly make</a> a lottery system, where people can
buy as many tickets they want, voting for the species they<a name="3125qlink3"> want to see brought back. When some magic
number of dollars is reached, the ticket selected as the winner decides which species 'wins' the
dollars for its reintroduction.</a>

Comments???
