<i>&gt;</i><br>

Yeah, hell, the City of Lowell, Mass, named a day after me when I was born for
gawds sakes.

is a html version of the proclamation. I guess this holiday comemmorates what a
good idea it is to name the mayor's son as my godfather....;)

<p>
On the other hand, the idea that we shouldn't comemmorate dates on which people
did extraordinary things (especially things which furthered extropy), is kinda
deconstructionist to me.

<p>
Besides, I like having my own holiday, even though I didn't do much to earn
it....hopefully I will do so sometime in this life....
