  IAN: As bad as I know things are, I can't stop being 
  dumbstruck... the outrage!.. the atrocity of it all! 
  It's because I dream of a world that is not (a world 
  of freedom and ethics) that I can't accept what is.


<p>
<a href="1138.html#1189qlink3">&gt;Certainly no one on this list could be shocked.  I'm just surprised</a><br>

<p>
  IAN: Right, that's really weird. These people
  have no problem with allowing mass poisoning,
  yet feel compelled by some ethical code to write
  such into law. Like it would be wrong to do it
  otherwise.? Very odd! I guess it's a legal cover
  so that if anyone ever was able to prove they were 
  poisoned, the court would say: "Sorry, it's legal.
  Those who wrote the law were democratically elected,
  thus poisoning the people was the will of the people."
