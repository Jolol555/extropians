Yes definitely. I've got the server space on the ISP I'm starting up. If
you guys want to figure out a good name that corresponds with an available
daomain name, let me know. What does it take to get an *.edu domain name?
For a curriculum, I'd say building an anthology of authors like that
suggested above, with papers on them that have been published as well as
commentary from past mail list archives. We could pull from bibliographies
in books by Damien Broderick, Jim Halperin, Tipler, and others to build up
a 'library'. I think that most of the resources are on the web or
elsewhere, but we need to definitely come up with a course curriculum and
synopsis.
