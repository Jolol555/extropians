I've noticed that Penrose is long on guesses and short on actual data. Lets
see some microtubule signal studies that show actual computation. We don't
know whats going on in there because we aren't developing any kind of a
database of fine grained neuron to neuron signaling (or microtubule, for
that matter) from which to analyse that actual computation is taking place,
in what format, etc. Our present approach on that scale is tantamount to
moving rowboats with battleships, or using the proverbial nuke to swat a
fly.

<p>
When I sit in front of my TV, when it is on, I know that 'something' is
going on in there, but nothing I see on the screen is telling me exactly
what. I cannot infer a video receiver circuit merely from seeing that a
display exhibits information, nor can I trouble shoot the circuit components
on such a basis. I can develop many ideas of how the pictures came to be,
from accurate theories all the way to theories about little men being
trapped in the box, or it being a window to god..... just because I put nice
fancy catch phrases in my description doesn't make it so.
