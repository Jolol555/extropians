Hi :-)

<p>
<a name="3882qlink1"><a name="3878qlink1">True that I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to things that
aren't heat-expansion related in terms of expansion.
I'm only talking from my own practical experience, as that's the only thing
that I know is true. Most of the ideas that are in current science courses
<a name="3881qlink1">are based on theory. Theory in my definition of the word is unverified ideas.</a></a>
<a name="3882qlink2"><a name="3878qlink2">I don't understand how scientists have arrived at the fact that the
universe is expanding if not simply from theory.</a></a>
<a name="3882qlink3"><a name="3878qlink3">And theory is guessing. I'd rather not accept guessings.</a></a></a>

<p>
<a name="3882qlink4"><a name="3878qlink4">If you're going to look at new ways of doing things, you can't think in a
mode of thought common to the old. It requires a complete, quick, snap
turnaround. You can't keep the old if you want the new.</a></a>

<p>
Julian.
