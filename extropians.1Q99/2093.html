Reduction in the body content of DDE in the Mongolian gerbil 
treated with sucrose
<br>

Abstract
<br>
It has previously been shown that oral administration to rats of 
sucrose polyester (SPE4), a nonabsorbable
lipophilic binding agent, greatly stimulates the fecal excretion of 
coorally administered DDT5 (R.J. Jandacek,
1982, Drug Metab. Rev., 13, 695-714). To determine whether this 
agent would stimulate the excretion of
<br>
persistent metabolites of DDT stored in body tissues, we treated a 
group of gerbils with [14C]-DDT and
<br>
monitored the fecal excretion of radioactivity for several months 
until a terminal, log-linear phase of excretion
was observed. At this point, when greater than 75% of the fecal 
radioactivity was identified as [14C]DDE, we
fed the animals diets containing up to 10% sucrose polyester and 
found that the rate of excretion of
<br>
radioactivity in the stool promptly increased two to three times as 
compared to the rate in the preceding
<br>
control period. Some rats were subjected to a 25-50% restriction 
in total food allotment, but this produced
no significant change in fecal excretion of total radioactivity. 
However, when food restriction was combined
with administration of sucrose polyester, there was a dramatic, 
eightfold average increase in excretion of
fecal radioactivity. This synergistic effect was reversed (within 24 
hr) when the animals were transferred to a
normal diet. Measurement of total body radioactivity confirmed that 
food restriction plus sucrose polyester
<br>
treatment reduced the body content of the pesticide. We conclude 
that stimulation of intestinal excretion
may offer a new approach to treatment of patients exposed to 
lipophilic environmental contaminants.
