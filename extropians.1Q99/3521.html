<p>
I am going to take a shot at starting a discussion of issues relevant to
<a name="3525qlink2"><a name="3524qlink2">immediate choices.  In particular, the "What needs doing" message that
will follow.  If people follow up with ideological disputes,</a> the message
</a>
<a name="3525qlink3"><a name="3524qlink3">will not yield results.

<p>
Initial subject line:
<br>
"NOW:  What needs doing [Yudkowsky]"<br>

<p>
Replies along the lines of "I don't think you should do that for
&lt;ultimate goals reason&gt;", or anything else concerning the futuristic
scenario, should change to "&gt;H:  *I* think nanotech is wonderful!"

<p>
Replies with your own set of projects should change to "NOW:  What needs
</a>
</a>
<a name="3525qlink4"><a name="3524qlink4">doing [MyName]".

<p>
If each and every project is not something that you could start doing
NOW, legally, with modern technology, please change the subject line to
<br>
"LATER:  What needs doing [MyName]".  For example, "Let's genetically<br>
engineer mosquitoes to carry an antiagathic" is LATER.  "Let's
investigate the possibility of using mosquitoes as cheap measles
vaccinations" would be NOW.  Items that need a billion dollars in
funding are okay; but, insofar as I don't think anyone</a> with that kind of
</a>
<a name="3525qlink5"><a name="3524qlink5">money is reading the list, please suggest, say, that the foundation be
started with a million and that this seed money be used to seek funding
from the major Internet tycoons.  Ta-da!  It's NOWed.

Please, please, PLEASE follow these rules.  If you don't, you are
sabotaging one of the last efforts to create a practical discussion
here.  You are sabotaging a discussion that has been widely</a> demanded and
</a>
<a name="3525qlink6"><a name="3524qlink6">which many people have expressed interest in.  You are sabotaging the
effort to create a subject line that people with important</a> resources can
</a>
<a name="3525qlink7"><a name="3524qlink7">read.  You are sabotaging the list.  You are sabotaging the projects. 
You are sabotaging the Singularity.  Unless one of the list</a> owners tells
</a>
<a name="3525qlink8"><a name="3524qlink8">me it's impolite, I will follow up each and every offending</a> message with
</a>
<a name="3525qlink9"><a name="3524qlink9">a corrected subject line and the phrase "CHANGE THE SUBJECT LINE,
PLEASE."  Again:  Please, please, PLEASE obey topic discipline.
