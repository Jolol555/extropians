C'mon, Samael, let's play fair.  What do you think the government is going
to do if I don't pay up?   Give me a lecture on civic virtue?

<p>
Just because our society is genteel enough to have lawyers doesn't mean the
guns have gone away.  If you lock the door and ignore the government's
agents, they will break it down, handcuff you, and drag you off to jail.  If
you try to defend yourself, they will either beat you senseless or shoot
you.  The only reason this doesn't happen more often is that most people
recognize that it is useless to put up a fight.

<p>
You may believe that the government is justified in using force to achieve
social goals, but don't tell me the force isn't there.
