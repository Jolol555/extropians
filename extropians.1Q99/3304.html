<p>
(I'm assuming that Eliezer meant "moral" and not "immoral" for that
statement to make logical sense)</a>

<a name="3305qlink2">Eliezer seems to be projecting thoughts and beliefs into what I said.  Why,

<p>
Eliezer , if you look back objectively at what I wrote, you'll see that we
actually are in agreement, and that this is a point I (alongside your
"others") have been making.

<p>
<a name="3305qlink3">Extropianism is properly concerned with taking a stand on the legislation
of morality -- I say that right in the snippet Eliezer quotes.</a>

<p>
However, Extropianism does not answer the question of whether abortion is
moral.  On that we also agree.  The no-first-coercion principle (assuming
it is an accepted axiom of Extropianism, which a recent list debate called
into question) doesn't get you there, because the real moral question is
whether a fetus (or any other entity one might name) is deserving of the
protection of that principle.

<p>
Where we disagree is on whether that question can be answered by empirical
knowledge.  Eliezer argued that it could be.  I posited that it probably
couldn't.

<p>
Finally, I stated that for pragmatic reasons, I didn't think it was worth
it to embroil Extropianism as a whole in this issue, given my perception of
the costs and benefits of taking a stand.

<p>
<a href="3268.html#3304qlink2">&gt; Since no additional definition is provided to the fundamental questions</a><br>
<i>&gt; of abortion by the Extropian axioms, and since the Extropians themselves</i><br>
<i>&gt; are divided, it is erroneous to state that Extropians are for, or</i><br>
<i>&gt; against, abortion - which is a statement I've seen, both on this list,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and in articles about Extropians.</i><br>

<p>
See, this is what we agree<a name="3305qlink4"> on.  I don't know why Eliezer is projecting
disagreement.  I could theorize, but then I'd be projecting as well.</a>  All I
disagree with is Eliezer's assumption that the moral question of whether an
entity should be protected under principles of a "right to life" can be
answered by reference to technical and empirical knowledge.  If not sloppy
thinking, it was sloppy writing, IMO, for Eliezer to have left out (or
assumed an unsupported answer to) the important step of determining the
value criteria.

<p>
<a href="3268.html#3304qlink3">&gt; Is abortion controversial?  Yes, but it's a controversy it well</a><br>
<i>&gt; deserves!  The stakes are either millions of innocent lives or the</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom of millions of innocent women.  And, if the Extropian Principles</i><br>
<i>&gt; had some bearing on it, we shouldn't hesitate to say so, just as we</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't hesitate to make controversial statements about the utility of</i><br>
<i>&gt; cryonics or intelligence enhancement.  But they don't, and we shouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; embroil Extropians qua Extropians in the conflict.</i><br>

<p>
I also agree here.  It is an important controversy, but that doesn't mean
it is important to Extropianism.  As Extropianism is currently defined.

<p>
Extropianism might one day attempt to rigorously answer the philosophical
question of which beings deserve protection under the no-first-coercion
principle.  As Glen Finney points out, in a post on this thread, this
question hasn't really been subject to much analytical rigor yet.  For now,
Extropians (and people in general) tend to answer this question on feel, on
an analog rather than binary continuum (i.e., most of us would probably
agree that parents have some moral right to coerce their children so as to
better guide their development, but that that coercion does not extend to
ending their existence), and pretty much tie their answer to memes of adult
human personhood.  It is therefore not surprising that reasonable
Extropians currently come to different conclusions.

<p>
It probably would be valuable to Extropianism to rigorously develop
philosophical answers to this question of which entities morally deserve
protection from coercion.  But it hasn't been done yet, and would probably
be a costly undertaking, in terms of time and quality thought if nothing
else.  I do know (though not in an empirical sense :-) that it is not worth
_my_ time.  I've already re-learned why I have a rule (which I violated)
not to post on anything abortion-related, given even rational people's (a
category which I do place Eliezer in, given his past posts) tendency to
assume they know what another thinks, rather than read what they wrote,
when discussing the topic.

<p>
Absent such an effort and such answers (which despite Glen's invitation, I
shall not undertake at this time), I agree with Eliezer that reasonable
Extropians can differ on the question of whether abortion is moral.  I just
don't agree that the answer can reduced to a simple empirical question.
