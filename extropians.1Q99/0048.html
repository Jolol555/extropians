<i>&gt; All human persons generally want the same thing -- food, health, happiness, love,</i><br>
<a href="0035.html#0048qlink1">&gt; shelter.  As technology increases the human race should be able to</a><br>
<i>&gt; provide  the material necessities to sustain life for all people</i><br>
<i>&gt; regardless of race, creed, gender, or national origin.</i><br>

<p>
certainly... and to sustain life of other peoples and suppress suffering is good also
for you
<br>
since you will probably have a positive feedback more important than you investment
after.
<br>
Even if you are unaware of... i guess..
<br>
Of course, negative feedback is always possible. But i believe that statistically
positive feedback is far more important.

<p>
<i>&gt; It seems logic</i><br>
<a href="0035.html#0048qlink2">&gt; and reason point humanity in one direction and one direction only.</a><br>

<p>
it is also a good principle to, as much as possible, not coerce any part of humanity
on a arbitrary direction.

<p>
<a href="0035.html#0048qlink3">&gt; However, many transhumanist, including myself, will want to belong to a</a><br>
<i>&gt; super intelligence governed by some type of principles. I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedom to allow an individual to possess an unique sense of identity</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be one such principle.</i><br>

<p>
if it is their choice, but it would be far better if they have the ability to change
their mind about that after.
<br>
As for flesh sculpting it could be good to promote the reversability of decisions and
the information about... when it is possible.

<i>&gt; &gt;Well...It is certainly not necessary true... I *consider* also myself as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;transhumanist but i certainly don't believe</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that to optimize only our selves according to our private purposes is sufficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to live in a "good" society.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The problem is very easy to understand... we also have to give some "great</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;purposes" to the society or at least to some important parts of the society. If</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;we are not able to define such "great purposes" as could be as a mere</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;example a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;spatial colonization, our society will be locked by sub optimization.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0035.html#0048qlink5">&gt; On our  transhumanist road to  a better universal society the famous</a><br>
<i>&gt; philosophical interrogative of, "Does the end justify the means?"  will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be asked repeatedly.  I hope, for our own sakes, mankind can figure it</i><br>
<i>&gt; out.</i><br>

<p>
Ha... perhaps i'm dumb and it's late for me but i don't see the connection between my
prior little argument and your somewhat anthropocentric ethical last one...??

<p>
Anyway... sure... we will have to be as sure as possible that the actions we will do
will gives the results we are waiting for....

<p>
this is an important principle for any intelligent system and any purpose ;)
