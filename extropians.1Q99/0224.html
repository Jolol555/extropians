<i>&gt; &gt; with a HUGE grain of salt.  Looters aren't to be trusted, ya know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0229qlink1"><i>&gt; Imagine Albert Einstein breaking a store window and grabbing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; merchandise, running away with a boom box on his shoulder, his wispy</i><br>
<i>&gt; white hair flying in all directions as the German physicist anxiously</i><br>
<i>&gt; looks back over his shoulder for pursuing cops.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That's the kind of morals and ethics he had, right, Terry?</i><br>

<p>
Well, if one is to be consistent in applying moral judgment to
everyone, then yes, those were his morals.  That he chose to steal
with votes rather than a mask and gun is no excuse to me.  I can,
however, separate the genius and scientific integrity of the man
from his lack of personal integrity.</a>

<p>
<a href="0220.html#0224qlink2">&gt; In my experience, many if not most pure scientists and mathemeticians</a><br>
<i>&gt; lean towards socialism...</i><br>

<p>
A consequence of definition: "pure" scientists</a> and mathematicians
are those in academia rather than in productive enterprise.  Since
our system socializes education and a lot of research, it is
expected that those who do well in that environment think of it as
natural and normal.  If you look at scientists and mathematicians
who actually work for a living--say those doing R&amp;D in big industry,
insurance actuaries, bookies--I'm sure you'll get a different picture.
