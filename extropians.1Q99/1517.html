Actually, it sounds like these would be two different ways of storing
information in a knowledge base.  As you said, they are schemes for storing,
retrieving and communicating information.

<p>
Cognitive abilities, OTOH, are ways of discovering information.  They are
the means I use to discover that this thing in my hand is a doll, that it
resembles you, that I don't like you (but that sticking pins in you would be
inadvisable).  The rules of magic are the sort of thing that might be
discovered by an unsophisticated decision tree system - I want to perform
action X on object Y (but I can't), object Z is similar to Y, so perhaps
doing X to Z will achieve the desired result.  Perhaps the prevalence of
such beliefs indicates a common flaw in the human cognitive architecture?
