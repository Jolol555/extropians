lack of paper-length contributions on the topics which 
frequently appear on this list.</a></a></a></a> 

<p>
There is a natural spectrum of "length" of contributions on 
a topic, ranging from off-the-top one sentence comments 
to detailed book-length or longer analyses.  In between are
email posts and paper-length discussions.</a>  

<p>
Each of these lengths has its place, but contributions 
lengths should increase as topics become more important
and as conversations about them mature with time.

<p>
Shorter contributions are more flexible and responsive, 
allow discussants to more quickly adapt to changing 
feedback about what others find interesting and 
understandable.  Longer contributions, however, can 
support deeper and more elaborate examination of 
topics, and can make conversations more accessible to 
wider audiences.  

<p>
<a name="0900qlink2">On many novel topics on this list I think discussants 
too quickly begin with email, and would do better 
initially with the flexibility of a phone conversation.</a>  
On many older long-discussed topics, however, I think
conceptual progress is hindered by the failure of 
most of you to move on to paper-length contributions.  

<p>
<a name="0823qlink2">Now a few people have, over the years, written books
on the topics we discuss.  But these mostly come off
as idiosyncratic personal visions, instead of part 
of a conversation within a larger community.  They
mostly give the impression that the author thought up 
all this stuff by him/herself, and rarely cite others 
who they are responding to or building on.  

<p>
<a name="0900qlink3">Why?  It seems to me it is because of jumping too
quickly to book-length contributions, where paper 
length contributions would be more appropriate.</a></a> 

<p>
When you get a new idea, call up a friend and talk.  When 
that gets stale, write it up as a short post, and try it 
out on an email list or newsgroup.  But after the topic 
gets hashed out a lot in email, and discussions there 
don't seem so productive anymore, if you think the topic
still worth pursuing, please, MOVE ON TO WRITING PAPERS!

<p>
Now maybe the first paper-length contribution on a topic
will seem an idiosyncratic personal vision, but after
that good papers should cite each other and respond to 
each other, just as good email posts do.  And only after
the conversation of papers seems to be getting stale
and limited by the depth of analysis possible in a paper,
only then should you really think about writing a book. 

<p>
<a name="0708qlink2">I think you can infer some things about a topic from 
the length of contributions made on it.  If you only
ever see short contributions on a topic, you might 
reasonably infer that people don't really take it that 
seriously.  Either they don't care enough about it to 
take the next step, or the topic doesn't withstand 
careful scrutiny; those people who tried to write 
longer analyses realized it's all bunk and gave up.</a>

<p>
So what do you guys want other folks to infer about 
the topics that come up over and over on this list?  
The "it's science fiction, not science" critique 
can be in part translated as "sure they'll throw out 
a few half-baked ideas in a novel, but anyone who
thinks about it carefully will realize it doesn't 
make sense."  

<p>
Well, do these ideas make sense or not?
