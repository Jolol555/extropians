You're right, it isn't just numbers of voters.  It comes down to convincing
the politicians that you can reach them at the polls, which is a combination
of public relations, lobbying, actual voting, etc.  I'm not sure we would
actually win at the polls, however.  An outright ban would probably fail,
but the public seems pretty willing to allow any kind of reasonable-sounding
restrictions.  A background check here, a waiting period there, a few extra
fees, maybe a few "reasonable" restrictions on weapon ownership - we aren't
that many laws away from legislating the 2nd amendment out of existence.
