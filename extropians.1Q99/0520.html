<a name="0564qlink1">I am not a proponent of animal torture.  I would never knowingly
torture an animal.  I suppose re: this entire discussion that
ownership of an animal may need to be looked at as a different sort of
ownership than the ownership of a chair, but I'm not clear as to why.

<p>
I'm from Mississippi and I remember my grandparents telling me how
they used to kill hogs by dumping them live into scalding water.  Then
they ate 'em.  Yum.  Was that torture?  

<p>
I'm all for the wholesale butchering of cows and hogs and fish and
other yummy animals.  I don't think they should be unnecessarily
harmed, but I have no problem with raising animals for the sole
purpose of killing em and eating em.  We've (humanity) been doing it
for a long, long time.

<p>
How many people say they're for ethical treatment of animals and only
mean the cute ones?  How many skittish vegitarians are more than
willing to smack the shit out of a spider or a fly (or have</a> their
boyfriends do it for them)?  How many of us give a damn when we step
on an ant bed?  Who'd feel bad if I shot a snake (or cut it in two
with a machete)?

<p>
I'm not sure that non-sentient beings have a right to their own
<br>
"selves."  Will have to have a discussion about the treatment of<br>
bacteria and amoebas?
