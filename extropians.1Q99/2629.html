Thanks for the String Theory... I had no idea. For me it was the Unified Field
Theory....

<i>&gt; Yes, Adrian, you must understand that to many or most people on this list, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; word 'god' is a null set or else triggers very negative memes. Most of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; highly intelligent people here on the list are rather tired of the old, worn</i><br>
<i>&gt; out, childish schoolyard bully gods, as well as the simple-minded 'don't worry,</i><br>
<i>&gt; be happy' gods. While creating a more 'spiritual' means of communicating and</i><br>
<i>&gt; understanding transhumanism and extropy is laudable, referring to future</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumans as 'gods' is, in my mind, more of a hindrance than a help,</i><br>
<i>&gt; specifically because of all of the emotional and memetic baggage that the word</i><br>
<i>&gt; already posesses.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is why Vinge's term of a Power seems more appropriate, though it may still</i><br>
<i>&gt; have connotations with the nation-state use of the term Power and Super-Power.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Just calling them transhumans, and eventually post-humans, brings such entities</i><br>
<i>&gt; down to a singular, everyday level that individual humans can relate to, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; the terms are sufficiently new that they don't carry any memetic baggage.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally, if we are all to attain god-like capability, then such capability at</i><br>
<i>&gt; that time will be considered to be merely human capability by those people. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; will only be seen as fantastic and extraordinary by those who insist on being</i><br>
<i>&gt; left in a primitive state. We should not orient our view of such a world from</i><br>
<i>&gt; the primitive perspective, if we are to become the new gods...as transhumans.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The need for a theology of ourselves would only be useful, in my mind, if we</i><br>
<i>&gt; wished the remaining primitives to worship us.....which I don't have a need</i><br>
<i>&gt; for. Do you?</i><br>
