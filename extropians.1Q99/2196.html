<p>
There is one difference here.<a name="2207qlink1">  Apple paid Xerox for the rights to use
</a>
their ideas before receiving any technical specifications from Xerox.
Microsoft promised to pay for Apple technology, but then refused to pay
after delivery.

<p>
Most people don't know the details of this often-cited case.  Microsoft
<a name="2207qlink2">purchased technology from Apple which they used to develop Windows,
which was initially intended to be a Macintosh emulator for the PC.</a>
Microsoft promised to pay royalties to Apple on every copy of Windows
sold.  Microsoft then decided not to sell any copies of Windows, and
thus didn't have to pay Apple anything.  Instead, they independently
developed an unrelated product which they dubbed "Windows 2.0".  Apple
argued that Windows 2.0 looked like the same product as "Windows 1.0".
Microsoft successfully argued that the new Windows was rewritten to look
exactly like the old Windows without looking at the source code from
Apple.

<p>
<a name="2207qlink3">Microsoft also did this with their deal with IBM in which they promised
to let IBM have rights to put Windows 3.0 technology into their OS/2
operating system.  Having seen what Microsoft did to Apple, IBM made
sure the contracts gave them rights to Windows 3.0 technology and all
future derivative works.  Microsoft then came out with Windows 95, and
claimed that it was a brand new operating system that was in no way
related to prior versions of Windows.</a>  IBM also tried to claim that
Windows 95 was a derivative of Windows because the functionality was so
similar between the products.  Microsoft again successfully argued that
they were independently written and were in no way related to each
other.
