I agree.  After thinking about it, I think most schemes to filter the
list could hurt the main list.  I think a better solution would be to
leave the main list alone.  Start a second list that is filtered by an
on-topic moderator.  When people join, they can choose among the main
list, the members-only list, the regional lists, and the filtered list.
Maybe it could be a digest format.  It could even include the title of
the thread that is being filtered with a one-line note that this message
was filtered as being off-topic, but is available on the main list.

<p>
An alternative would be to start using those suggested prefixes again,
so that anybody can filter the list on their own.  This sounds like the
most "extropian" way to do it.

(Hey, look!  There's a META: tag on this message!  Someone already beat
me to it!)
