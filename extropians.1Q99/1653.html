<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; mailing lists I run because their ISPs bounce my mail.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But even if it could work, there are numerous problems:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1. It might be spam anyway, why do you think that making spammers put a</i><br>
<i>&gt;    verified email address on their message will stop them?</i><br>

<p>
Its easier for me to track down who their provider is and demand that their
service get cancelled and that they be indentified to me so that I can bill them
for the spam. If their provider refuses, then I can just refuse all traffic from
that providers routers.

<p>
<a href="1645.html#1653qlink2">&gt; 2. It might be spam sent through a remailer.</a><br>

<p>
remailers that support spam will get their services cut by their own providers,
or will get embargoed by ISP's that won't tolerate such crap.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1645.html#1653qlink3">&gt; 3. It might be spam sent from a throwaway dialup account.</a><br>

<p>
If its from a throwaway, then there is a dialup ISP that I can pester for ID info
on the spammers, and likewise embargo them if they don't cooperate.

<p>
<a href="1645.html#1653qlink4">&gt; 4. It might be spam sent with a perfectly legitimate but fake email</a><br>
<i>&gt;    address.</i><br>

<p>
What is legitimate but fake? Oh, you mean impersonated? Like how I have the
address of my dialup on the From here, but my reply to is my mike@lorrey.com
address. Someone might put my email address in their header. Gotcha. If the mail
didn't come from there, then it really should get bounced because of a conflict
between the header info and the routing info.

<p>
There needs to be some capability to track it, if not then we need to create a
hunting season on spammers to keep the population in check...
