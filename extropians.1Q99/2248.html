<a name="2277qlink1">Adrian &amp; Anders,

<p>
<a name="2261qlink1">     As someone with an interest in both &gt;H and Theology, I couldn't resist
joining in on this discussion.  I think one of the first things I would ask of
you is what you are using as initial parameters.  Theology, if I remember
correctly, means "The study of God (or gods)."  This implies that you are
predicting the existence and or emergence of a God or gods.  So my first
question is what criteria would a being have to meet to be classified as a
god?  There have been several such standards suggested.  Two that seem to be
fairly constant is Power and Worship.  A god is thus defined as in some way
being incredibly (transcendantly?) capable, and/or being worshipped.  Given
<a name="2261qlink2">the strong libertarian and humanist background of Extropianism, worship might
<a name="2257qlink2">be something that Extropians might find unappealing</a> (for to worship implies a
</a>
<a name="2257qlink3">level of submission, and to be worshipped implies having others dependent upon
<a name="2261qlink3">you).  However, there is another way to look at the worship issue.  If you
</a>
think first what qualities are worthy of worship, by which I mean what
principles (memes?) are you willing to give you life to and for (for some
people, the answer would be none), now posit the possibility of a being or
beings capable of exemplifying those principles perfectly, as well as having
the power to back up those principles, then you might just have found that
there is a God(s)</a> to you.

<p>
<a name="2261qlink4">     Adrian, I believe you said you were interested in developing an Extropian
Theology.  This I imagine would have two main qualities, one would be a God or
gods whom uphold Extropian values, and a Cosmology based on an Extropian
worldview.  In such a theology, I imagine a deity would begin in some material
substrate and develop through an evolutionary process.  In fact,</a> intelligent
life in this Universe might be considered the raw materials from which gods
will develop somewhere on the other side of the Singularity.  I agree with you
that such a deity would likely not be very interested in worship.  You may
</a>
have some different starting points for the concept of a god, if so I would be
very interested in discussing them.  I also have some other ideas to discuss
as per the Monotheism vs Pantheism debate, but it will have to wait for
another post.
