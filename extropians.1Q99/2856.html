<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;    I would like to second the idea of not getting trapped in the Us vs. Them</i><br>
<i>&gt; meme.  I think it is important to remember that the general public is not the</i><br>
<i>&gt; enemy, they are our families, friends, coworkers, neighbors, and us.  We need</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be able to reach out to those who have not discovered &gt;H, help them to</i><br>
<i>&gt; understand why we believe what we do, and try to understand what their</i><br>
<i>&gt; concerns and misgivings are.</i><br>

<p>
Exactly. One of my favorite adages (borrowed from Robert Ingdahl) is
"The battle for the future will be settled during the coffee-breaks!"
- never underestimate the power of spreading memes into everyday
consciousness. And as you point out, we better learn about the
misgivings and give them a thought.

<p>
<a href="2801.html#2856qlink2">&gt; Remember, even a current enemy can be a future</a><br>
<i>&gt; ally, so let's neither demonize nor denigrate those who are not yet &gt;H, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; darn well not let anyone demonize or denigrate &gt;H. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="2976qlink1">It is a bit like a memetic prisoners' dilemma: we can defect or
cooperate with other memes. And of course, &gt;H is a rather borad stream
of thought, so we might quite well end up on very different sides in
some issues - which is really good as long as it doesn't hinder us
from developing.

<p>
<a href="2801.html#2856qlink3">&gt; Because of our personality types, those of us currently involved in</a><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism will probably always be somewhere out on the cutting edge of</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought, but if we honestly believe that we are heading in the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; direction, then it would be a good idea to make sure that the rest of humanity</i><br>
<i>&gt; knows where we're going so they can follow if so inclined. </i><br>

<p>
And if we are wrong, we can make a good warning example and hope the
others can save us! :-)

<p>
Strength through diversity.
