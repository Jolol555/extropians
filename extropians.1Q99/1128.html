I've also noticed a number of articles in the popular press recently that took
at least an even tone to reporting on technological developments of transhuman
interest.  However, I also took a look this morning at the poll CNN ran along
with the story.  Only 49% of the approximately 10,000 respondents answered
"Yes" to the question, "Would you consider having microchips implanted in your
body?"  Considering the over-all technophilic tendency of an Internet
audience, this isn't that large a portion of the respondents.  Of course, the
positive response would likely have been much higher if some widely-accepted
medical purpose for a chip implant had been identified in the poll question,
such as for a pacemaker(an already common chip implant).  Perhaps I should be
happy that almost half the respondents said they would accept a chip implant,
even when the purpose wasn't specified . . .
