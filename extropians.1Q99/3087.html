planet
<br>
<a href="3081.html#3087qlink3">&gt;&gt; into the awesome and unknowable FUTURE."  I'd buy one with that edit.</a><br>

<i>&gt;Hmmm... &lt;drums fingers on desk&gt;...  That's actually a pretty good</i><br>
<i>&gt;objection.  Maybe an alternate version would be a good idea.  Still, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;a slogan, I think the first version is slightly better.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3081.html#3087qlink5">&gt;What I'm saying is not that we are going to COERCE the world into the</a><br>
<i>&gt;future, but that a lot of people, as always, are going to try to hide</i><br>

<i>&gt;technology more complicated than a Whitney gin.  We are going to have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;deal with technophobia.</i><br>


<p>
Agreed.

<p>
<a href="3081.html#3087qlink6">&gt;One of the things a cause needs is a problem to overcome, and it does</a><br>
<i>&gt;help if the problem is political.  I'm treading on really thin ice by</i><br>
<i>&gt;doing that, but as long as I imply reluctance rather than evil</i><br>
<i>&gt;opposition, I haven't crossed the divide into hate-mongering (UNLIKE</i><br>
<i>&gt;people who use the term "entropians", by the way).  The Extropian quest</i><br>
<i>&gt;is not purely technological; we have memes to overcome.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In point of actual fact, the planet WILL go into the future "kicking and</i><br>
<i>&gt;screaming" and it will have to be dragged.  It always has been.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Which makes a nice reply to the people who walk up to you and want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;talk to you about the "kicking and screaming" part.  "Oh, no, we don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;want to force anyone; it's just that part of the problem is the media</i><br>
<i>&gt;getting hysterical about things like cloning and genetic engineering."</i><br>
<i>&gt;(If challenged, add "There are legitimate issues, but they aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt;raised; there's too much panic-mongering and sensationalism.")</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Finally, and most importantly, "lead" isn't quite as vivid as "drag,</i><br>
<i>&gt;kicking and screaming".  I can't think of an equally good phrase offhand.</i><br>


<p>
Yeah, "lead" is a bit wimpy.  Michael Butler offered "drive" instead of
"lead" but hat doesn't really have a ring to it either.  I guess I was
worrying about the people that see the phrase and *don't* walk over to ask
for clarification.

<p>
Actually, the more I read the original, the less it bothers me.  Slogans
_should_ be somewhat provocative and in your face.  As Roseanna Roseanna
Danna might have said, "Nevermind."
