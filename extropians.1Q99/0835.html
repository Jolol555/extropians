  Just got back on the grid after a 50-hour 
  power vacation imposed by a nasty, albeit
  visually surreal, ice-glaze storm that 
  did a lot of arboreal rearrangement to 
  the detriment of myriad power lines.

<p>
  IAN: In the case of man, there's a good supply 
  of alternatives to the theory that rural people 
  are less criminal since they kill more animals. 

<p>
  On reason that people may become more violent 
  when crowded is simply because they want to push 
  others out of their way, and one way to do that 
  is push them out of life. Perhaps that response 
  is more of a "population control" instinct than
  the arising of a "repressed-hunting instinct."

<p>
  Of course, interesting to observe, carnivorism
  arises in some varieties of frog tadpole, where
  some of the tadpoles eat their noncarnivorous
  siblings! That might work with your theory.?</a>

<p>
<a name="0868qlink2"><i>&gt; [mice and men] are distinct species with different behaviors. </i><br>


<p>
  IAN: That mice and men appear to respond in 
  the same way (more violent when crowded) is 
  a good indicator of a useful analogy, which
  is why they cited the study showing that on 
</a>
  some program I've seen on "over population."

<p>
<a name="0868qlink3">  In that mouse study, it seems plausible to  
  say that depravation of hunting was not a 
  causal factor in the observed increase in 
  aggression upon crowding, since noncrowded
  mice in the laboratory were not (I assume)
  hunting for food, but eating the very same 
  lab-rat chow that the crowded mice ate.</a>

<p>
<a name="0868qlink4">  IAN: I'd say humans are pretty "domesticated" too.</a>

<a href="0715.html#0835qlink6">&gt;&gt;   IAN: OK, good point, my error. By</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   "great apes" I meant the gorillas,</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

even if
<br>
<a href="0715.html#0835qlink7">&gt;not by the hands of man. Same with the orangutan.</a><br>


<p>
  IAN: Yes, and I agree. It could be possible 
  to maintain the theory that survival goes to 
  those beings that can most effectively and 
  casually kill other beings, such that 
  "socio-pathic" brutality and murder are 
  the keys to success in life, and I think 
  that grim view is only bolstered by humans. 

<p>
  I believe it's inherently true that those 
  with the most guns "win"; they rule the 
  nations and write the laws and history, 
  and thus "might makes right" = reality.
