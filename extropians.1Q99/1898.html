  IAN: It's basic physics that when you throw a ball 
  up and it reaches its apex, it is there at zero mph.
  Momentum and velocity are at zero at the apex. The 
  noseless airframe would have expended it's forward
  momentum long before it even reached its peak, much 
  less have kept it thereafter. The mathematical analysis 
  of aerodynamics engineer Edward Zehr is agreed on by 
  all on that matter, which is, the rate that it would 
  stall, which both his static and dynamic flight models 
  prove is within 5 seconds after the forward section 
  broke away, which voids the 3,200 foot climb to 17,000.
