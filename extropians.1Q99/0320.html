Its pretty plain and simple what I mean. Anyone with a dictionary who knows

what the meaning of the word 'is' is can figure it out. ;)

<p>
Objective universal standards of right and wrong are based upon</a> the observed
laws of nature.<a name="0325qlink4"> Man is not separate from nature (despite how much
</a>
subjectivists would like to claim) and is bound by its laws. These laws are
not subjective. Some are based on relativity, but are so at macro scales far
<a name="0325qlink5">beyond the usefullness of society. While due to relativity, there is some
subjectivity in the macro universe, causality is not broken except in the
heart of a singularity. The whole of human civilization exists in such a
narrow range at low end of the scale that using physical relativity</a> to justify
<a name="0325qlink6">moral relativism is merely a form of cargo cultism.</a>

<p>
<a name="0323qlink1">I have no desire to revolutionize a large chunk of philosophy which merely
exists to justify the self indulgent moral relativist looter mentality of the
intellectually lazy baby boomer generation.
