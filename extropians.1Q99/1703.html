<p>
By doing the work: holding conferences, writing articles, teaching courses,
producing projects, talking to people for the purpose of spreading ideas
and educating.

<p>
The act of exploiting and avoiding psychological triggers is an art, and
you can check the archives for threads on memetic engineering.

<p>
<a href="1682.html#1703qlink2">&gt;2. Get transhumanist ideas debated in society. Not necessarily</a><br>
<i>&gt;accepted, but made part of the overall discourse.</i><br>

<p>
This is a key area that we have been working on over the years, and can
certainly continue with great magnitude.  I think that Extropy Institute's
participation in world-class issues and debates is necessary and important.

<p>
<a href="1682.html#1703qlink3">&gt;Where would advertising be useful? </a><br>

<p>
We do advertise as often and as prolifically as has been possible given
monetary constraints.  There has been no prime-time ad on TV, but this
isn't to say that I wouldn't want to create one.  The cost is out of control. 

<p>
Each and every time an extropian writes a book, article, makes an
appearance in the media or print, teaches a course, etc., we are spreading
memes.  The conferences are brilliant ways to advertise our transhumanity.

<p>
On a large scale, advertising would be a perfect way to attract the masses
and something that we shall continue doing.  If you know of anyone, Jane,
who has money to contribute to an advertising campaign, please contact my
agency studio.
