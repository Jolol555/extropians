Okay, the basic fallacy here is that anybody knows what the Objective
Morality is.  I ain't got a clue.  If I did, I wouldn't be building SIs
to clue me in, I'd be building them for quite different reasons.

<a name="0467qlink1">The three rules of my philosophy, Externalism:


<OL>
  <li>  Morality is an objective, observer-independent reality external to
ourselves.  Questions of right and wrong are questions of true and
false; there is no ontological distinction between "what is the mass of
</a>
this particle" and "what should I do now".

  <li>  I don't know what the objective morality is and neither do you. 
Anything we say on the subject is a guess, just like any other
scientific statement.

  <li>  Since objective morality is real and external from our opinions, our
instincts can have no influence on it; thus objective morality is
probably as strange and unintuitive as quantum physics or general relativity.

Spoken by Death.  And if I, too, may quote:

<p>
  "Are you too *scared* to change the world?"
  Death turned.  The very sight of his expression made Susan back away.
  He advanced slowly toward her.  His voice, when it came, was a hiss.
  "YOU SAY THAT TO *ME*?  YOU STAND THERE IN THAT PRETTY DRESS AND SAY
THAT TO *ME*?  YOU?  YOU PRATTLE ON ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD?  COULD YOU
FIND THE COURAGE TO ACCEPT IT?  TO KNOW WHAT *MUST* *BE* *DONE* AND DO
IT, WHATEVER THE COST?  IS THERE ONE HUMAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHO
KNOWS WHAT DUTY *MEANS*?"
