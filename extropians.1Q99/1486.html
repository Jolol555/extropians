the cost of the mailing from the sender to the intermediate networks

has upheld to date.  This type of law (cost transfer) will cover
future types of situations such as people spamming your palm pilot or
spamming your digital pager or even spamming your PCS phone.  This is
the type of law which was just submitted to the Texas Congress.  Even
California is considering additional laws because their original one
just doesn't have enough teeth</a> in it.

it no longer profitable and worth the risk.  You will always have some
clueless chicken-boner spammers out there but we will be able to put
it to a quick stop be it by LARTing the spammer or by terminating his
access.</a>

The mail and wire fraud laws are very, very good examples of why
spamming
<br>
laws are a really bad idea. Just take a look sometime at the numerous
cases
<br>
where these laws are used for things they were never intended to
</a>
cover; back
<br>
when I kept up with the hacking press, it seemed that practically
every US
<br>
hacker caught was charged with wire fraud with its high penalties,
even 
<br>
though the crime was never intended to apply to hacking.

<p>
Oh get real. Late time I checked the average murderer spent about
eight
<br>
years in jail; you want to put spammers in jail for longer than
murderers!?
<br>
Do you have any idea how much these kind of laws are screwing up the
US
<br>
legal system? Next time someone's accused of spamming they'll just
come
<br>
out shooting, because they'll have nothing to lose...
