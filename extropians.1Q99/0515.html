<a href="0487.html#0515qlink1">&gt; Okay. Please define ethics in some sort of objective way.  Show me the</a><br>
<i>&gt; logical, non-emotional basis for ethics.</i><br>

<p>
Objective ethics: a group of heuristics which have proven over time</a> (even at
<a name="0565qlink2">evolutionary time scales) to provide the greatest benefit to the long term
rational self interest of an individual or group that adheres</a> to the heuristics.
<a name="0565qlink3">Because we live in an objective reality ruled by concrete laws</a> of physics at the
<a name="0565qlink4">time and space scales at which we as individuals and as a group exist,</a> which
<a name="0565qlink5">dictate the structure and behavior of the systems or methods</a> called 'evolution',
<a name="0565qlink6">and 'society', that objective reality dictates the types</a> of heuristics which
<a name="0565qlink7">fulfill the first premise.</a>

<a href="0487.html#0515qlink2">&gt; &gt;&gt;and based my actions around aesthetics - ie what I liek and dislike.</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Rather short-sighted, if you ask me. There are lots of things I don't like</i><br>
<a name="0565qlink9"><i>&gt; &gt;that I nevertheless realize are good for me. Flu shots, for instance.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So, I like Flu shots.  Becasuwe I recognise their long term value.</a>  Liking</i><br>
<a name="0565qlink10"><i>&gt; something is not necessarily an instaneous thing.  You can like</a> the outcome</i><br>
<i>&gt; of something.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0565qlink11">ok, we are getting somewhere. you understand the concept of long</a> term rational
<a name="0565qlink12">self interest, which is distinctly different from opportunism or hedonism,</a> which
<a name="0565qlink13">you seem to be more aligned</a> with.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<a href="0487.html#0515qlink3">&gt; &gt;I think prudence makes a much firmer grounding for ethical principles than</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;does mere pleasure seeking/pain avoidance.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;And I like living. And I like having access to things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Why should anyone else care what you like? Why are you entitled to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;something just because you like it?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0565qlink14"><i>&gt; i'm not _entitled_ to anything.  I have no rights, except as a social</i><br>
<i>&gt; construct agreed between two or more people.  Rights are an _invention_.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You can't point to one, or hold one up or stick a needle into it.  It's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; theoretical creation of the human minds.</i><br>

<p>
On the contrary. As Aristotle and Socrates have both elucidated,</a> that a being is
<a name="0565qlink15">endowed with something by nature gives the being a natural right</a> to use that
<a name="0565qlink16">something. I am given the ability to speak, so I have a natural right</a> to speak.
<a name="0565qlink17">I have reproductive organs, so I have a natural right to reproduce.</a> I have legs,
<a name="0565qlink18">therefore I have a natural right to ambulate. I have two hands, therefore</a> I have
<a name="0565qlink19">the ability to wield and manipulate any object I can grasp, and I have</a> a brain
<a name="0565qlink20">that can remember, create, plan, imagine, as well as many other things.</a> Since we
<a name="0565qlink21">were not endowed with any natural weapons to defend ourselves outside</a> of our
<a name="0565qlink22">hands and minds, but can wield any weapon we create with our hands, we</a> have a
<a name="0565qlink23">natural right to keep and bear arms, and use those arms in our defense.
Moreover, we are endowed with life, and therefore have the right</a> to keep that
<a name="0565qlink24">life. While this also says that animals may have the right to life as well,</a> we
<a name="0565qlink25">were evolved as predators and scavengers (as well</a> as agricultural gatherers),
<a name="0565qlink26">and therefore have a natural right to kill animals and eat meat.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0487.html#0515qlink4">&gt; I keep pointing out that I don't believe these things exist and then you ask</a><br>
<i>&gt; me where they are.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I feel like I'm stuck with a bad copy of Eliza:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Me:  I don't believe in morals</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You: That's a rather immoral thing to say.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ack!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sorry, if I'm causing offence, but I'm still waiting for one example for a</i><br>
<i>&gt; purely logical basis for morals or ethics that does not depend on what you,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I or anyone else thinks or feels.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

See the above.
