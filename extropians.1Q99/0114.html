Oh, no, not the dreaded identity question! :-)

<p>
I'm not getting into this one - in my experience, everyone who cares has
already made up their mind.

I'm not sure what you're getting at here.

<p>
OK, I'll bite.  Here's my current best guess:

<p>
Computer speeds undergo a very fast exponential growth over the next few
decades, as the doubling time continues to decrease.</a>  Non-sentient AI turns
out to be pretty easy once you have a fast enough machine, so automated
engineering devices can be built.  Limited forms of nanotech arrive pretty
soon, but Drexlerian wondertech takes another decade or so - we have to wait
for computers to get fast enough to design this stuff.

<p>
<a name="0145qlink2">That gives us two major branches:

<p>
If non-sentient seed AIs are relatively easy to make, Eliezer's program (or
one like it) becomes an SI between 2010 and 2030.  In this case we'd better
make sure it grows up sane, because its going to decide all of our fates.</a>

<p>
<a name="0145qlink3">If not, we have a period of about a decade in which our entire technology
base improves with the speed the computer industry displays today.  Real
intelligence enhancement should become possible towards the end of this time
frame, using neural interface hardware and fancy software.</a>  The conquest of
aging and disease should also fall into this period - neither problem is
hard enough to require full nanotech.

<p>
<a name="0145qlink4">After that, the rate of change becomes too fast for unenhanced humans to
keep up with.  Advanced nanotech and uploading arrive within a few years of
each other, and megascale engineering projects (Jupiter brains, Dyson
spheres) become practical a year or two later.  By then there are lots of
Powers around, and I have no idea what they will be doing.</a>
