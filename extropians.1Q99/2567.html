<a href="2358.html#2567qlink1">    &gt;I don't understand why it seems that no one can recognize the</a><br>
<i>    &gt;plain obvious most important of all facts that a glorious red spiritual</i><br>
<i>    &gt;qualia is in our mind or brain and only represents and is very different</i><br>
<i>    &gt;from the 700 nm light beyond our eyes?</i><br>

<p>
Everybody recognizes that as true but not everybody recognizes it
as profound, or a property meat has a monopoly on either.

<p>
<a href="2358.html#2567qlink2">    &gt;Why is it so hard for people to admit that such a red sensation</a><br>
<i>    &gt;is so much more than a mere abstract representation by a set</i><br>
<i>    &gt;of switches in an information processing system?</i><br>

<p>
Because it doesn't appear to be true. If I change some of those
switches in your head the glorious red spiritual qualia you experience
also changes. For example, the drug Viagra will often make things look
bluer for a few hours after you take it. I understand it will do other things too.

<p>
<a href="2358.html#2567qlink3">    &gt;Why can't people realize that an abstract machine, while</a><br>
<i>    &gt;trying to pass a Turing Test and trying to answer the question: "What</i><br>
<i>    &gt;is red or salty like?" is obviously lying and not really experiencing</i><br>
<i>    &gt;anything like red, love, warmth, salty, pain</i><br>

<p>
Perhaps the machine is lying, but I must insist that it is very far from obvious.


<p>
<i>    &gt;And why is it so difficult to realize that once we understand this most</i><br>
<a href="2358.html#2567qlink4">    &gt;important of all things to understand about reality, and once we know</a><br>
<i>    &gt;what qualia are, that we will be able to engineer ways to eff and share such</i><br>
<i>    &gt;glorious feelings?</i><br>

<p>
It's not difficult it's impossible, because you'll never know for certain if your
"understanding" of how subjectivity works is correct.

<p>
<i>    &gt;Why is it so hard to realize the simple fact that effing techniques</i><br>
<a href="2358.html#2567qlink5">    &gt;will let us know if the machine is lying or not and finally solve the</a><br>
<i>    &gt;problems like Jaron is talking about</i><br>

<p>
It won't work, I could know for certain what I feel like when I'm
connected to one of Jaron's effing machines that is also connected
to you, but what you are feeling would remain conjecture, just like
it is today.
