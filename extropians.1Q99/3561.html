and very practical theory of the Singularity:  If we don't get some kind

Remember, from an altruistic perspective, I don't care whether the
Singularity is now or in ten thousand years - the reason I'm in a rush
has nothing whatsoever to do with the meaning of life.  I'm sure that
humanity will create a Singularity of one kind or another, if it
survives.  But the longer it takes to get to the Singularity, the higher
the chance of humanity wiping itself out.

<a name="3572qlink3">My current estimate, as of right now, is that humanity has no more than
a 30% chance of making it, probably less.<a name="3814qlink2">  The most realistic estimate

I'm not at all sure about objective morality, although I'm fairly sure
the human-baseline morality isn't objective fact.  And I can conceive of
an "objective observer-dependent morality", where the invariants would
shift from the correct choice to some more basic quantity, just as the
Einsteinian formulation of spacetime made distance variable and interval invariant.

<p>
<a name="3572qlink5">The point is - are you so utterly, absolutely, unflinchingly certain
that (1) morality</a> is subjective (2) your morality is correct (3)
<a name="3572qlink6">AI-based Powers would kill</a> you and (4) human Powers would be your
<a name="3572qlink7">friends - that you would try to deliberately avoid an AI-based Singularity?</a>

<a name="3572qlink8">It will take *incredibly* sophisticated nanotechnology before a human
can become the first Power - *far* beyond that needed for one guy to
destroy the world.</a>  (Earliest estimate:  2025.  Most realistic:  2040.) 
<a name="3572qlink9">We're running close enough to the edge as it is.  It is by no means
certain that the AI Powers will be any more hostile or less friendly
than the human ones.  I really don't think we can afford to be choosy.</a>
