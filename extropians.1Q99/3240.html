<p>
I think we can peer deeper and find more fundamental drivers to the
structure of social systems than human emotions.  Genes and memes appear to
be the primary drivers.  The survival value of cooperation gives rise to
altruism.  Altruism gives rise to social relationships.  Technological
innovation maximizes the efficiency and effectiveness of cooperation on
several levels while at the same time making individuals more autonomous.
Ultimately, technology should eliminate genes as a primary driver of social
structure.  Information sharing, searches for knowledge not encapusable in
algorithms, hoarded knowledge, and to some extent memes may constitute the
only drivers of social interaction in the future.  This concert of factors
should lead to some interesting social systems.

<p>
I don't think the three I cited were necessarily "soft" science in the since
they are less grounded in science.  However, I believe they attempt to
wrestle with phenomena that are more complex than many scientific areas.  I
agree that the areas you've mentioned would prove helpful in developing an
intuition on how certain technologies would affect the structure of future
social systems.
