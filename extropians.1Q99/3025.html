You've got to learn the difference between a scientific organization and a
political action committee!  Any group whose history page
&lt;<a href="http://www.nationalcenter.org/NCPPRHist.html">http://www.nationalcenter.org/NCPPRHist.html</a>&gt; starts off with framed
quotes from from Michael Reagan, Dick Armey, Rush Limbaugh, and Tom DeLay,
is not a scientific organization.  The page says that they were founded
specifically to serve the Conservative Movement.  They research all sorts
of issues, but always come up with answers that match what the
conservatives want.  True science researches an issue to find the answer. 
This group was founded to provide the required answers, and then performed
their "research."


<p>
I notice that this "media alert" wasn't actually published by any reputable
media.  I also notice that the article seems short on facts.  It says that
"glaciers are not drastically receding", but doesn't say their not
receding.  It says "in many cases are expanding", but doesn't say if more
are expanding than are decreasing.  In fact, there is very little substance
in the article to examine.  It spends much more time on politics and
conspiracy theory than it does on glaciers.  It also fails to give any
specific findings, fails to mention who did the research and when.  There
is no news in this article, it is just a restatement of conservative
belief.  If any new study was actually performed, the article certainly
didn't make it clear.
