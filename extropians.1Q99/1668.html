You made some good points, and I'm no longer regarding Amazon as such a 
'tulip bulb' bubble, but I disagree with this one. From all the economic
statistics I've seen in the last few months the high value mostly seems to
be coming from all the money the Fed is pushing into the economy to keep 
people happy so Clinton doesn't get kicked out of office. 

<p>
People aren't making this money by working, they're borrowing it; as soon 
as interest rates go up and people stop borrowing, the bubble will burst.
But by then the Senate trial will be over and Clinton will be laughing.
