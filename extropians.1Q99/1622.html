<i>&gt; At the risk of oversimplifying things, I'd like to add to</i><br>
<i>&gt; your sentiments by saying that ultimately all laws,</i><br>
<i>&gt; advertently or inadvertently, end up hurting the poor and</i><br>
<i>&gt; helping the rich.   Which ironically is a growing sentiment</i><br>
<i>&gt; of hip laws students at Ivy league schools!  A nagging</i><br>
<i>&gt; feeling that has continued to grow for me, is that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; entire legal system (at least in the US) is increasingly</i><br>
<i>&gt; becoming a complete joke perpetrated on the rest of us as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; smokescreen to benefit the corporate interests of the rich</i><br>
<i>&gt; at the expense of everyone else.  The gun control issue is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the latest to magnify this effect.  I'm therefore not</i><br>
<i>&gt; surprised that the Democratic party is behind this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Although they have operated on the pretense that they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; the common person's party, their actions have spoken</i><br>
<i>&gt; otherwise:</i><br>

products are taxed at several hundred percent rates, this will not only reduce
market demand, but their ability to make a profit, which also goes against
corporate interests.</a>

<p>
What corporations make money off of less guns?

<p>
<a href="1605.html#1622qlink2">&gt; A Republican run CIA overthrows third world dictators and</a><br>
<i>&gt; institutes their own pupppet-dictators and righ-wing</i><br>
<i>&gt; governments.</i><br>

<p>
Uh, I don't see how you can say this about anything in the last 30 years.
Lessee, Ferdinand Marcos got tossed out and Cory Aquino became president, who is
hardly right wing. The autocratic government of South Korea lost an election to
a former political prisoner and is now themselves in prison on corruption and
human rights charges. The new democratic government of Nicaragua is hardly
right-wing, nor is the government of Panama. Pinochet is out and Fujimoro is
in.  Afghanistan is about the only one I can think of which might fit your
description....

<p>
Uh, you mean pre-revolutionary Iran? Actually, it was Nixon and Ford who were
the big freinds of the Shah and instituted the free grain program..Carter just
inheritied the mess.

<p>
<a href="1605.html#1622qlink4">&gt; The end result is the same - the US federal government</a><br>

<p>
Lets see now. We got tossed out of the Phillipines, out of Vietnam, out of Iran,
out of Afghanistan, and we are leaving Panama..... Yeah, we are really in
control, aren't we?
