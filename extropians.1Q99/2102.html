I think that sentence might better be taken out in both places.

<p>
Yes.

<p>
<a href="2099.html#2102qlink4">&gt;&gt; Secondly, Max More originally defined Transhumanism. </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With all due respect to Max, I don't think that is quite accurate. </i><br>
<i>&gt;The term was coined by Julian Huxley in 1957. The concept has </i><br>

<i>&gt;originated transhumanism.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2132qlink2">I agree with you on most of your statement.  However, Max's writing on
transhumanism is indeed separate from what Julian Huxley intention with
transhuman meaning "man remaining man." 
</a>

<p>
Let me quote from my book _Create/Recreate_:

<p>
Ideas about humanity and evolution were explored by Julian Huxley in his
writings on evolutionary humanism in the book Evolution: The Modern
Synthesis (1942) and Teilhard de Chardin in The Future of Man (1959). In
1966, FM-2030 (formerly, F.M. Esfandiary) outlined an evolutionary
transhuman future while teaching “New Concepts of the Human” at the New
School for Social Research, New York City.  Abraham Maslow referred to
transhumans in Toward a Psychology of Being,(1968), and Robert Ettinger
authored Man into Superman (1972).  

<p>
In the dictionary, “transhuman” is defined as meaning “superhuman,” and
“transhumanize,” meaning “to elevate or transform to something beyond what
is human” (Webster’s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, 1983). Yet, this
is not a complete and contemporary meaning.  Today, we refer to transhuman
as meaning an evolutionary transition from being human to becoming posthuman.

<p>
The actual concept of transhuman as an evolutionary transition was first
expressed by FM-2030.  His trilogy, Up-Wingers, Telespheres and Optimism
One (1973) constitutes the beginnings of the transhumanist philosophy, as
well as his contributing final chapter in Woman, Year 2000, (1972).

<p>
FM later defined transhuman as “a new kind of being crystallizing from the
monumental breakthroughs of the late twentieth century. ... the earliest
manifestations of a new evolutionary being.”  Later, he authored the book
Are You A Transhuman? (1989)   

<p>
Transhumanism has a slightly different beginning.  Julian Huxley’s book
written in 1956,  New Bottles For New Wine, contains the essay
“TRANSHUMANISM”  which sets  out  to explain how humans must establish a
better environment for themselves.  He also alludes to a new species that
the human might eventually become. The difference in Huxley’s transhumanism
and Max More’s transhumanism is that Huxley states “man remaining man but
transcending himself.”  Transhumanism as defined by Max More explains the
overcoming of human limits and the transformation from being human to
becoming posthuman. Although Huxley had a vision of a possible future for
humanity, he single-tracked the future when he saw man remaining man.
