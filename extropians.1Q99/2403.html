 What about this shot at an objective morality?
 
<p>
 Metamorality: Morality is by definition good. For morality to exist, there
 has to be something. Morality cannot exist in nothing. Before the big bang
 there was no universe, thus no morality.
 
<p>
 I think I disagree. Before there was sentient life, there was no morality.
 Morality makes no sense (as a system to support our decision-making) without
 a self-reflective ability to choose between yes and no, should and should
not.
<br>
 Life which does not have this ability is simply following its blind genetic
coding.
 
<p>
 Morality: Anything that makes the universe exist longer and fights the
 entropy is moral. The highest form of morality is whatever increases
 extropy.
 
<p>
 But isn't this an arbitrary definition (ie., non-objective?).
 Why should we think that it is a good definition? How does it help us
 predict human behavior?
 
<p>
 Couldn't it be as simple as that?
 
<p>
 Things are never that simple :-)

theft.

Thanks for great thinking,
