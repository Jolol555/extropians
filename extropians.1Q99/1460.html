Really?  Then I guess I should go to prison.  Recently I saw a reference
to an interesting-sounding crypto paper published earlier this year,
but I couldn't find the paper on the web.  I sent unsolicited email to
the author asking if he would mind sending me a copy.  He did not know
me, he has never indicated any interest in knowing me or anyone like me,
or my company, or my product, or my customer's products.  From what you
say, what I did is illegal and I should go to prison.

No doubt many more people will end up in the same boat if we continue to
criminalize behavior as some people are suggesting.
