<a name="0153qlink1"><a name="0152qlink1">I say 'it', because I expect human-equivalent hardware to arrive several
years before human-equivalent AI.  That means the first self-enhancing AI
that doesn't bottleneck will have the hardware to go from transhuman to SI
in a matter of days, at most.  At that point humans are far to slow to
interfere with it - it can invent general-purpose assemblers, use someone's
automated lab equipment to build one, and migrate itself to rapid
infrastructure in a matter of hours.  A few hours after that we've got a
full-grown Power on our hands.</a></a>

<a name="0152qlink2"><a href="0145.html#0149qlink5">&gt; Wearables and information services will be starting this process</a><br>
<i>&gt; within a decade, I'm fairly sure. Add agile manufacturing, and you can</i><br>
<i>&gt; get nanotech-like surprises in production even before nanotech</i><br>
<i>&gt; (imagine if the effects of microfactories spreading and cutting out</i><br>
<i>&gt; the middleman between sales and raw materials, as well as</i><br>
<i>&gt; transportation: micro outlet stores in every mall).</i><br>

<p>
Don't forget the biotech revolution.  Exponential advance gives us a
revolution in pharmacology in the coming decade, and cyberpunk-style body
modification in the decade after that.  The economic effect is not as
pronounced, but the social effects would be huge.</a>
