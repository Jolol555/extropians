It seems like a lot of people think Searle "killed" the area with his
apparently elegant arguments, while of course most people in the area
regard Searly as silly. After hearing Searle speak to a group of
neuroscientists, I can understand it. He was wonderfully persuasive,
and to a non computer-scientist what he said most likely sounded very
reasonable. Meanwhile, I was totally unconvinced about his anti-AI
arguments (he had some other good points, the man is not 100% evil :-)
