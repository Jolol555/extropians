Abstract
<br>
  We studied the effect of the water fraction of Panax ginseng, one of
  traditional oriental medicine herbs on apoptosis and the formation of
  medullary cell in the hair follicles of irradiated mice. The
  hair follicle or its differentiated product, the
  hair, which represents a linear historical record of
  follicular proliferative activity, could provide a biological indicator of
  the effect of radioprotective drugs. Adult N:GP(s) mice with
  hair follicles synchronously in the middle of the
  hair growth cycle received whole-body doses
  of gamma-radiation. The hair follicles were analysed either
  12 hours after irradiation with 2 Gy in the experiment on the apoptosis, or 3
  days after irradiation with 3 Gy in the experiment on the forming medulla.
  The number of medullary cells per unit length (100 microns) were measured by
  H and E staining. Apoptosis was detected by a nonisotopic in situ DNA
  end-labeling (ISEL) technique and H and E stain applied to the serial
  histologic sections. Ginseng administration before irradiation resulted in a
  suppression of apoptosis, as shown by a reduced number of cells stained with
  ISEL for fragmented DNA, both i.p. (0.3 mg/head, p &lt; 0.05) and p.o. (2 mg/ml
  of drinking water, p &lt; 0.05) treatment. In addition, ginseng treatment was
  associated with an increase in the number of medullary cell per unit length
  as compared with the vehicle treated mice (p &lt; 0.001, i.p.; p &lt; 0.05, p.o.).
  These results indicate that the water fraction of ginseng can exert a potent
  effect on the recovery of the hair follicles by its combined
  effects on proliferation and apoptosis of the cells in the
  hair follicle.
