Jeff,

<p>
A quick note to let you know I have hard copied you letter so that my
wife, who is a neurosurgeon, can give it a read a give her input.

<p>
She did a number of years of research with people who had suffered
strokes and how the brain "remaps" to make up some of the loss of
function, etc.

<p>
She also can give her clinical view of "brain dead" and what that means
in her profession.  

<p>
I do know from her talking about her work that most brain damage is
caused by either lack of oxygen/blood flow, or by compression in the
skull during a bleed or and event which causes swelling.  Also that in
most cases there is a rather large amount of cell death caused by one or
more of those things taking place.

<p>
If interested I will post more after she gives it a read.

<p>
Lee
