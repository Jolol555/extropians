<p>
I wouldn't call it a project, since it's just something I discovered
while doing something else, but anyway...  No, you didn't.  But a
foundation does not mean proof.  Nor will my foundation (or any other)
let you bootstrap from a total incomprehension of logic; if so, it could
be taught to a rock.  But, if you are capable of understanding arguments
but as yet have no positive beliefs about anything, including the
validity of argument; if you accept arguments as valid but do not accept
"arguments are valid" as valid - an anti-Tortoise problem - then my
foundation will let you bootstrap.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2948qlink2">Note that it will NOT let you accept "arguments are valid" as certain,
which would violate the Godelian rules; and which also demonstrates that
this is not a trivial argument, since a tautology would be certain.

<p>
<a href="2909.html#2914qlink2">&gt; &gt;The argument in favor of logic and reason is by no means certain, but it</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;is better than anything else.  If you try to deny all arguments as</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;anyone has to argue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="2948qlink3"><i>&gt; Anyway, this isn't even true.  Why can't I accept some non-rational or even</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrational claim about how I should live my life?  Why not live by instinct</i><br>
<i>&gt; alone, adopt a Zen philosophy, and reject logic altogether?</i><br>

<p>
Because it won't work.  If it does work, let me know and I'll join you.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2948qlink4">Yes, I know that's not what you were asking.  If you start out with a
mistaken positive belief about the validity of instincts and therefore
discount all argument, my foundation won't get you out of it.
