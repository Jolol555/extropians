Be careful with your attributions.  Someone reading this post would
assume the review was authored by me when, in fact, it was not.

There's nothing wrong with admiring some new and insightful theoretical
view.  I simply advocate healthy skepticism toward any alleged
"breakthrough" until there is broader support within the scientific
community (afterwards, as well).  Maintaining one's skeptical perspective is
particularly difficult when a theory promises to validate one's pre-existing
belief system.  I'm not familiar with you or your beliefs and I'm not
accusing you of this, but it's been my observation that those who *want* to
believe in god are strongly drawn to these "there's divinity in the details"
theories.

<p>
I say this at the risk, of course, of being the recipient of one of your
scathing epthets such as "know-it-all smarty pants".  ;-)
