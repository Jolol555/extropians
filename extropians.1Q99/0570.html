<i>&gt;   that it has to do with rural people being</i><br>

<a name="0615qlink1">I look at criminals as a natural phenomemon of the urban economic ecosystem.
<a name="0582qlink1">Individuals that are denied skills or opportunity to practice productive skills in

<a name="0615qlink2">the society will resort naturally to predatory economics, being economically
carnivorous upon the assets of the members of the herd. It does not matter if the
</a>
<a name="0615qlink3">predator is an Ivan Boesky or John Dillinger, it is the same behavior. Just as
</a>
<a name="0615qlink4">with natural predators, criminals will develop a 'drug of choice' or preferred
</a>
<a name="0615qlink5">form of prey, which is why most criminals only practice one or two forms of crime.
</a>

<p>
<a name="0615qlink6"><a name="0582qlink2">Violent crime is similarly a form of repressed predation. Since in an urban
</a>
environment, there is no other species besides humans, dogs, cats, and rats, you
</a>
<a name="0615qlink7">will get sociopathic individuals who will express their natural hunting urges
first upon 'acceptable' species to prey upon, then marginally
acceptable/unacceptable species (dogs and cats), then as the individual becomes
</a>
<a name="0615qlink8">more dislocated from society, they may prey upon the unacceptable prey species,
</a>
<a name="0615qlink9">humans. This progression is a visible indication of the progression of their
mental illness, but the hunting urge is not the illness, merely how the illness
</a>
<a name="0615qlink10">expresses itself in an environment of a limited ecosystem.

<p>
<a name="0582qlink3">This is one reason why I view the general urban/vegetarian fear of guns and gun
</a>
</a>
<a name="0615qlink11">owners as also an instinctual fear that the herbivore has for the carnivore. We
</a>
<a name="0615qlink12">as humans also have this instinct, which comes to the fore as we practice a
vegetarian lifestyle, since we did evolve from vegetarian/scavengers who were
preyed upon by many predators, including homo erectus, and the great cats. This
</a>
<a name="0615qlink13"><a name="0594qlink1">fear, when it becomes the core of mental illness, is manifested in haplophobia,
</a>
<a name="0615qlink14">which is recognized in the literature as an irrational fear of guns. It is an
illness of transference, as we have a natural fear of seeing the natural weapons
</a>
<a name="0615qlink15">of predators exhibited.
</a>

<p>
<a name="0582qlink4">When attacked, a herbivore will tend to flee, while an omnivore will tend to stand
</a>
</a>
<a name="0615qlink16">and fight, which explains the whole debate over right-to-carry vs.
no-right-to-carry concealed weapons, as it is merely a manifestation of the
different viewpoints of the herbivorous (sublimated as an economic herbivore or as
</a>
<a name="0615qlink17">an actual vegetarian) humans who prefer to avoid and flee and that of the
omnivorous humans who would prefer to stand and fight a predator, and would prefer
</a>
<a name="0615qlink18">to be equally matched to that predator in weaponry. Herbivorous humans, as herd
</a>
<a name="0615qlink19">creatures, will depend upon the 'tamed' few deviants they think they have control
</a>
<a name="0615qlink20">of (i.e. police/government) to protect them from the predators, but will also seek
</a>
<a name="0615qlink21">to disarm the omnivores due to misplaced association with the predators.
</a>

<p>
<a name="0615qlink22"><a href="0554.html#0570qlink2">&gt;   Also, most primates aren't carnivores, and</a><br>
<i>&gt;   as I recall, if they eat any flesh it's less</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;   than 10% of their diet (the great apes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;   strict vegetarians), and so the idea of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;   human "hunting instinct" seems debatable.</i><br>

<p>
Uh, not quite. While the gorilla and orangutan are vegetarians, chimps and baboons
</a>
<a name="0615qlink23">are omnivorous carnivores, eating everything from roots to leaves and nuts and
</a>
<a name="0615qlink24">fruit, grubs to lizards, birds and injured ungulates, etc. including, sometimes,
</a>
each other.

<p>
<a name="0615qlink25">Now, as for humans, considering that we have evidence of  tool use in the
harvesting of ungulates (proto-horses, proto-bison, mammoths, proto-deer, etc) as
</a>
<a name="0615qlink26">well as other species like the great sloth, cave bear, etc, for several hundred
</a>
<a name="0615qlink27">thousand years, and we have fossilized spears etc which are also several hundred
</a>
<a name="0615qlink28">thousand years old, we know that hunting has been a constant practice of human
</a>
<a name="0615qlink29">beings throughout their history. We also know that the late homo erectus preyed
</a>
<a name="0615qlink30">upon the early homo sapiens, as well as many other species, so the evolved
practices go much farther back than just human history.

<p>
We also know from the few cases of 'feral children' that hunting is a practice
</a>
<a name="0615qlink31">which develops naturally if the opportunity is there (i.e. there is ample game
</a>
<a name="0615qlink32">available to develop skills with).
