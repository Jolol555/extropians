If you can get a court decision you might be able to turn it over to a
collections agency and let them deal with the TRW etc. landsharks. 
Then they would have a harder time not paying...

<i>&gt; -------------------------</i><br>

<p>
 I've noticed that since I registered with several well known REMOVE
list sites,
<br>
and with an occasional threatening letter to ISPs that provide
services to
<br>
spammers, the only spam I tend to receive now is usually mirrored by
whoever is
<br>
targeting the extropians list, as I usually get a duplicate addressed
to me as
<br>
well as one addressed to the list.

<p>
I'm now billing ISPs that refuse to provide information on the
spammers to me the
<br>
$500.00 fee that the CRA allows, since by concealing their identities,
they are in
<br>
effect colluding and are acessories after the fact. Juno is now up to
around
<br>
$6500.00, yahoo is at $3500.00, usa.net is up to $2500.00. and others
are at
<br>
lesser amounts. Another few months and I should have enough in
accounts
<br>
receivables to get my lawyer salivating to take over the case I am
putting
<br>
together... I wouldn't mind not making any money even if I won, just
to get my
<br>
lawyer enthused and to cost the spammers as much as possible.

<p>
If anyone wants to get in on this, make a file in your email software
to stick the
<br>
spam messages in, and forward them occasionally to:
spamsuit@lorrey.com with full
<br>
header information.
