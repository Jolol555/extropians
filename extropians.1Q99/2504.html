I must second this!<a name="2597qlink1">  What seem like innane questions and fears to most

<a name="2597qlink3">Most people would be terrified to hear about immortals, cryonics,
cloning, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, alternative
governments, colonizing space, resequencing DNA, taking smart drugs, or
augmenting human biology.  I seriously predict that all these areas will
be outlawed as soon as they become commonly available.  Most of humanity
is strongly against all these ideas.  I think the biggest obstacle to
achieving these things is our own inability to predict the public
backlash.</a>
