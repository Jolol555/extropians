<p>
The Redneck Application of the 7 Principles of Extropianism:</a>


<OL>
  <li>  Perpetual Progress - "I want to kill more deer.  To do so, I will
become a smarter hunter - ever increasing my deer hunting skills.</a>  If
I live indefinitely, the number of deer I kill will increase.  I will
seek to remove all obstacles standing in the way of killing more deer
- be they political, cultural, biological or psychological."</a>

<a name="0729qlink3">  <li>  Self-Transformation - "I also want to drink more beer. I affirm
that I will direct my entire being to transform myself into a more
efficient beer-drinking person.  Through critical and creative
thinking I will become a better beer drinker.  I will explore
biological and neurological augmentations that will allow me to
consume ever-greater quantities of beer."
</a>

<a name="0729qlink4">  <li>  Practical Optimism - "Life is great.  I know I will continue to
have more and more opportunities to drink beer and kill deer."
</a>

<a name="0729qlink5">  <li>  Intelligent Technology - "There must be some way to applice science
and technology to enable me to consume more beer and kill ever greater
numbers of deer.  Perhaps a new laser equipped, satellite enhanced
site for my rifle, neuro-implants to sharpen my vision, and a
mouth-widening operation to allow me to drink two bottles of beer at
the same time.  I refuse to see technology as an ends to itself, but
more as an enabler to allow me to further my redneck goals."
</a>

<a name="0729qlink6">  <li>  Open Society - "I support social orders that promote freedom of
rifle ownership and deer hunting.  I oppose authoritarian social
controls which ban the drinking of beer, even on Sunday.  I prefer
bargaining over battling, exchange over compulsion, and serious
hunting over spotlighting."
</a>

<a name="0729qlink7">  <li>  Self-Direction - "The woods over over yonder, my rifle is right
here and the cooler's in the truck!  All set!"
</a>

<a name="0729qlink8">  <li>  Rational Thinking - "I know that without hunting, the population of
deer will skyrocket, and while large numbers of deer make for a target
rich environment, too many deer will cause starvation which may lead
to extinction of deer population in certain areas, perhaps including
the Skunky Bark Huntin' Camp.  The more accurate my rifle site is, the
better shot I will become, thus increasing my hit to miss ratio.  Beer
frees the mind from worrying about the wife, twelve kids, six dogs,
leaking roof, the Trans Am on blocks in front of the trailer, and my
current lack of employment.  Budweiser is indeed, the king of beers."
