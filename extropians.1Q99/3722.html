<p>
What are we talking about, here?  The idea that we probably live in the
time with the largest population, ergo there are no galactic civilizations?</a>

<p>
<a name="3784qlink2">Nope.  Argument falls apart if the population keeps growing infinitely.</a> 
And, if an infinite population lets us be here now, I don't see why a
finite population would make it harder.

<p>
The problem is that all situations "require", "predict" our modern
environment, and while a situation that predicts it with a higher
absolute probability would be more likely, I don't think that the
relative probability can yield predictive heuristics.

<p>
<a name="3784qlink3">I mean, what you're saying is that if I don't know whether I'm in an
environment where everyone has different numbers or everyone has the
same number, no matter which number I get, I should predict that
everyone has the same number.</a>  Or at least that's sort of what it sounds
like.  Now, if I had to guess everyone else's number, I'd guess it was
the same as mine, because I don't have anything better to guess.  But
that doesn't mean I know anything more about whether everyone really
does have the same number.

<p>
If you know the relative probabilities, you can assume you're any
observer.  I don't think it works in reverse.

<p>
<a name="3784qlink4">The Doomsday argument doesn't look very predictive.  I mean, every
single generation except ours that tried to use it would be wrong,
</a>right?<a name="3784qlink5">  And we have no reason to think that we'll be different, right? 
According to the "predict the present given the past" clause, this
heuristic is no good.</a>

<p>
<a name="3784qlink6">Actually, I don't know if I accept the Doomsday argument.  Maybe when I
decide, I'll add another adjective to Yudkowsky's Modified Anthropic
Occam's Razor.</a>

<p>
<a name="3784qlink7">But if I did accept the Doomsday argument, given the number of times I
have to use the Anthropic principle to explain my own existence - once
for the noncomputable qualia, and another time for being a Specialist,
and another time for having the chance to do something fun and
important, e.g. Singularity - I'd have to assume I was a computer
simulation, right?</a>  I mean, I'm something out of science fiction, so I'd
<a name="3784qlink8">have to assume I was *actual* science fiction.  There are more books
than people, right?  This set of assumptions explains all the facts at a
much higher relative probability, right?</a>

<p>
So, insofar as I still tentatively think the world is real, and I'm not
just being run as a test case to determine whether a certain type of
IEer is trustworthy, and I'm not a book, then I'd say I'd also have to
reject the Doomsday argument.  Of course, if you really exist, you're
welcome to think differently.
