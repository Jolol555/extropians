Uh, for the average American, bees *are* more dangerous than great white 
sharks. For the average American, their bathroom *is* more dangerous than 
a gun. For someone swimming with a great white shark it's more dangerous 
than a bee. For someone facing a jackbooted government thug, the thug's
gun is more dangerous than their bathroom.

<p>
Why should we be concerned about these special cases when we're talking
about the effect on the average American's life? The average American is
far more likely to die in a bathroom accident than a gun accident. That's
it. You're trying to turn the discussion to some special case which is
irrelevant to what we're talking about.
