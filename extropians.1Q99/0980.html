<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; track of all of my efforts to destroy you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again, tracking every large natural object inside the orbit of Saturn is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; that big a deal.  Comets are especially hard to hide - an asteroid would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been a better choice.</i><br>

<p>
I'm using nanotech. My impactor will not have the attributes of a comet,
because I'll extract the metals to create a shell, which I will then
paint flat black, lowering the albedo to below that of a carbonaceous chondrite.

<a href="0938.html#0980qlink4">&gt; &gt; That is inconsistent with the concept of complete freedom of action for</a><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Did I say I was an Anarchist?  Governments will only be replaced if we come</i><br>
<i>&gt; up with another institution capable of fighting wars - either way, there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to be an Earth-Luna defense system backed by the collective resources</i><br>
<i>&gt; of four billion human beings.  Good luck - you'll need it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Any weapon</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you can build and use to defend against an earth-massed weapon can be used</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; against the earth, also.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Comets aren't 'earth-massed weapons' - a typical comet might weigh 10^12</i><br>
<i>&gt; tons, while the Earth is more like 10^21 tons.  That's why comets are</i><br>
<i>&gt; relatively easy to stop.  If you want to use a really big object (like</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ganymede) as a missile a short-range interception becomes impractical - but</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is no way to move something that massive without releasing enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy to tell the whole solar system what you're up to in plenty of time to</i><br>
<i>&gt; stop it.</i><br>

humanity.
