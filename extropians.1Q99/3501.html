<a name="3503qlink1">There is no accepted glossary or dictionary reference for the Constitution, as
far as I know the interpretation of definitions is a combination of
interpretation of the "Framer's Intent" and common law court precedents.  I
believe the Framers were quite logical, inclusive, and procedural in their works,
and the Constitution and Bill of Rights with Amendments are fine works.

<p>
I believe if the Author's of the Constitution and other revolutionary credos of
the day were here with us today, their paramount concern would be the freedom of
expression and privacy rights, considering that we as Americans have stumbled
though several centuries somewhat successfully maintaining Democracy, and the
longest running continuous Democracy.
