<p>
Yes, it's a fun little hike.;) I went up there in the summer of 1997 with
about ten paleontologists as part of the Second International Trilobite
Conference for which I wrote the field guide.

<p>
Here is a QuickTime VR panorama taken on the day I went up there:

(Credit for the shot goes to Jay Holmes of the Museum of Natural History.
Extra points for lugging the tripod up there.)

<p>
I also put together a bibliography of papers relating to the shale:

<p>
and here's me in a very awkward Gouldian pose. This shot (as well as
Gould's in _Wonderful_Life_ is actually taken at Raymond's Quarry, just
above Walcott's -- the shale itself:

<a href="1373.html#1559qlink2">&gt;i believe wolcotts quarry has been declared</a><br>
<i>&gt;a world heritage site now.  (my trip was in late summer 1990).</i><br>

<p>
Yes, it's official now.

<p>
<a href="1373.html#1559qlink3">&gt;the guide to wolcott's quarry had mixed feelings about sjg.  there</a><br>
<i>&gt;was the expected resentment i guess, but also a deep admiration.</i><br>

<p>
Gould brings some things (back) into the public eye now and then. I
wouldn't really say anything else nice about him. IMO he tends to be more
misleading than not. (Some of his older work on heterochrony was good,
however). Also, for people like me who can't stand baseball, his
_Full_House_ is a tiresome read since he uses endless baseball analogies to
illustrate a fairly simple statistical point.

<p>
The Burgess Shale IMO has limited importance in explaining the patterns of
past life as a whole, as there is little material for comparison. Some of
the attention given to the shale may be a distraction from more useful
research. Overall the attention is of course beneficial as it increases the
public interest in Paleontology necessary for work to continue.
