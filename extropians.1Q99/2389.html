<p>
I was actually sticking to human-level and moderately superhuman entities (I
try to avoid making predictions about what an SI would do).  In that realm,
the problem we face is that specifying a set of moral principles does not
uniquely determine what an entity will actually decide to do.</a>

<p>
We can see many examples of this by observing each other.  Even people who
subscribe to the same philosophy often have bitter arguments about the
practical consequences of their principles.  This problem becomes worse with
AIs that are smarter than we are, because they will see implications of our
principles that we haven't thought of yet.

<p>
<a name="2534qlink2"><a href="2359.html#2389qlink3">&gt; Question: What are the criteria whereby the SI determines whether its</a><br>
<i>&gt; fundamental values "need" to be changed?</i><br>

<p>
The same criteria you or I would use.</a>  Anyone who thinks deeply about these
<a name="2534qlink3">issues will discover that their fundamental values contain all sorts of
conflicts, ambiguities and limitations.  Anyone who lives in a changing
world will find the need to apply their values to situations no one has ever
thought of before.</a>

<p>
<a name="2497qlink1">Now, I wouldn't abandon the whole foundation of my moral system overnight,
and I don't expect the AIs to do it either.</a>  But I would expect my ideas to
change over time, and with enough time I hesitate to predict what the end
result might be.  I would expect the AIs to gradually develop their moral
systems in response to new ideas and new situations, and I would expect that
they will occasionally make adjustments to even their most fundamental
values.

<p>
With human-equivalent AIs, this process could take thousands of years to
produce major changes.  With posthuman AIs, who live hundreds or thousands
of times faster than we do, the evolution would be much faster.

<p>
<a name="2534qlink4"><a href="2359.html#2389qlink4">&gt; &gt; Worse, what happens when it decides to improve its own goal system?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Improve according to what standard?</i><br>

<p>
No piece of software is perfect.  A self-enhancing entity is going to find
ways of re-writing the system to make it faster, more flexible, and better
able to deal with difficult problems.  Eventually it will find
decision-making methods that work better than ours, but use completely alien
mechanisms.  consider, for example, a mind built using an optimized
combination of conventional AI, neural networks, populations of genetic
algorithms and quantum computers.  Would we really expect such an entity to
be anything like us?</a>

<p>
<a name="2534qlink5">there is one additional point I'd like to make about all of this, because it
is easy to overlook.  All of the mechanisms I've brought up result in the AI
adopting viewpoints that we ourselves might agree with, if we had the same
intelligence and experience.  The posthumans won't just wake up and decide
to be psychotic one morning.  If they eventually decide to adopt a morality
we don't like, it will be because our own values naturally lead to that
position.

<p>
Now, isn't that as much as we have any right to expect?</a>
