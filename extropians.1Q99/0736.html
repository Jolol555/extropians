Well, being an *actual* redneck myself (hell, I grew up in Vicksburg,
MS - the Gibralter of the damned Confederacy!) I did this just for the
hell of it.  ;)

<i>&gt; &gt; The Extropian Redneck:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The Redneck Application of the 7 Principles of Extropianism:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1. Perpetual Progress - "I want to kill more deer.  To do so, I will</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; become a smarter hunter - ever increasing my deer hunting skills. </i><br>
If
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink4">&gt; &gt; I live indefinitely, the number of deer I kill will increase.  I</a><br>
will
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink5">&gt; &gt; seek to remove all obstacles standing in the way of killing more</a><br>
deer
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink6">&gt; &gt; - be they political, cultural, biological or psychological."</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You automatically assume that I find utility in killing MORE deer</i><br>
per unit of time. This is an unjustified and untrue
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink7">&gt; assumption. I may seek to increase my deer hunting skills by making</a><br>
it more difficult for me to kill a deer, say
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink8">&gt; eventually I may only do so with bare hands, or that I must kill</a><br>
from beyond 1000 yards, or be within 10 yards, etc.,
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink9">&gt; which would obviously reduce my overall deer kill rate.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Actually, I'm assuming that a true redneck wouldn't be able to tell
the difference between quantity and quality of dead deer.  More dead
dear = good.

<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink10">&gt; &gt; 2. Self-Transformation - "I also want to drink more beer. I affirm</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that I will direct my entire being to transform myself into a more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; efficient beer-drinking person.  Through critical and creative</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thinking I will become a better beer drinker.  I will explore</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; biological and neurological augmentations that will allow me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; consume ever-greater quantities of beer."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; You again assume that the unit of improvement is quantity. I</i><br>
actually prefer microbrewed beer, for the taste. I tend to
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink11">&gt; drink less these days than in my Coors and Miller funnel chugging</a><br>
frat boy days in college....
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Again, to a redneck, quantity of beer is the important thing.  Most
rednecks wouldn't mind have an infinitely filled keg grafted onto
their back with a hose running directly into their mouth.  Nevermind
the taste, or sensation - it's fun to puke in the back of your truck!

<p>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink12">&gt; Try to imagine that you are talking about a Californian instead of a</a><br>
redneck:
<br>
<i>&gt; 2. Self-Transformation - "I also want to drink more wine. I affirm</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I will direct my entire being to transform myself into a more</i><br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink13">&gt; efficient wine-drinking person.  Through critical and creative</a><br>
<i>&gt; thinking I will become a better wine drinker.  I will explore</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological and neurological augmentations that will allow me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; consume ever-greater quantities of wine."</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is obviously inaccurate, as the goal will be to be a more</i><br>
discriminating and capable wine connesseur, the goal of
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink14">&gt; which would be to drink BETTER wine, and have better taste in wine.</a><br>

<p>
Well, to a redneck, wine is kind of like holy water to a vampire
(unless we're talking Mad Dog 20/20)...  Just the thought of wine
pisses off a redneck...

<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink15">&gt; &gt; 3. Practical Optimism - "Life is great.  I know I will continue to</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have more and more opportunities to drink beer and kill deer."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As far as the utility value of each permits... yes</i><br>

<p>
Remember utility = quantity

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink16">&gt; &gt; 4. Intelligent Technology - "There must be some way to applice</a><br>
science
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink17">&gt; &gt; and technology to enable me to consume more beer and kill ever</a><br>
greater
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink18">&gt; &gt; numbers of deer.  Perhaps a new laser equipped, satellite enhanced</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; site for my rifle, neuro-implants to sharpen my vision, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mouth-widening operation to allow me to drink two bottles of beer at</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the same time.  I refuse to see technology as an ends to itself, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; more as an enabler to allow me to further my redneck goals."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; excellent.... ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 5. Open Society - "I support social orders that promote freedom of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rifle ownership and deer hunting.  I oppose authoritarian social</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; controls which ban the drinking of beer, even on Sunday.  I prefer</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; bargaining over battling, exchange over compulsion, and serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hunting over spotlighting."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 6. Self-Direction - "The woods over over yonder, my rifle is right</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; here and the cooler's in the truck!  All set!"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 7. Rational Thinking - "I know that without hunting, the</i><br>
population of
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink19">&gt; &gt; deer will skyrocket, and while large numbers of deer make for a</a><br>
target
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink20">&gt; &gt; rich environment, too many deer will cause starvation which may lead</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to extinction of deer population in certain areas, perhaps including</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the Skunky Bark Huntin' Camp.  The more accurate my rifle site is,</i><br>
the
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink21">&gt; &gt; better shot I will become, thus increasing my hit to miss ratio. </a><br>
Beer
<br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink22">&gt; &gt; frees the mind from worrying about the wife, twelve kids, six dogs,</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; leaking roof, the Trans Am on blocks in front of the trailer, and my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; current lack of employment.  Budweiser is indeed, the king of</i><br>
beers."
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0729.html#0736qlink23">&gt; This is all very funny. I love it. I think I'll post it up at my</a><br>
hunting cabin (called the Steel Gate Camp).
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<br>
Cool, then you'll see some head scratchin' in addition to the butt
scratchin'.

<p>
Yee haw!
