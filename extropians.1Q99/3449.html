<p>
<a name="3456qlink1">Hardly. David Friedman makes some very strong game theory arguments for
his anarcho-capitalist ideas producing a stable society thru negative
feedback, whereas any kind of government has positive feedback loops; if
the government takes more power it can more easily take power in future.</a>

<p>
<a name="3456qlink3">Uh, they do seem likely to give much better results. That's why many of
us here think they're a good idea; or did, since a lot of the anarchists
on the list seem to have dropped out in the last few months of statist
invasion.</a>

<p>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink3">&gt;Now, a limited constitutional republic can come fairly close to the</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3456qlink4">For one or two generations, if that; then it's doomed because the system
contains the seeds of its own downfall.</a> 

<p>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink4">&gt;A successful anarchist scheme would offer very similar results.  You would</a><br>
<i>&gt;pay voluntary fees for police protection instead of taxes, but you would</i><br>
<i>&gt;still have to pay. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="3456qlink5">Why would you have to pay? If you don't want police 'protection' you just
buy a gun or two and protect yourself. That's not an option</a> in a government
<a name="3456qlink6">system... and anyway, private protection will be a lot cheaper than 
compulsory tax-funded government 'protection'.
</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;You would have a larger choice of legal regimes, but the</i><br>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink5">&gt;kinds of laws we really care about wouldn't exist in either scheme.  </a><br>

<p>
<a name="3456qlink7">Sorry? What? Huh? Where do you get that idea from?</a>

<p>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink6">&gt;In contrast, the most likely failure mode of a controlled anarchy scheme </a><br>
<i>&gt;is simple, uncontrolled anarchy.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3456qlink2">The whole point of anarcho-capitalism is that it doesn't have a 'likely
failure mode', because it has negative-feedback systems which begin to
act any time that the system starts to move from a stable state. This is
why I, as an engineer, like</a> it.

<p>
<a name="3456qlink8"><i>&gt;Those who have power take whatever they want</i><br>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink7">&gt;from those who don't, which results in a society with all the problems of</a><br>
<i>&gt;despotism and none of the advantages.  </i><br>

<p>
Only if you assume that a couple of hundred million well-armed anarchists
are just going to stand aside and hand over their money to a few thugs.</a>

<p>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink8">&gt;The end result is very</a><br>
<i>&gt;unpredictable - you could get anything from a tolerant democracy to a</i><br>
<i>&gt;totalitarian regime, and you can get it in a matter of a few years.</i><br>

<p>
Nonsense. Once an anarchist society gets into a stable state it is very
stable. The problem is getting from here to there, not staying there.

<p>
<a name="3456qlink9"><a href="3444.html#3449qlink9">&gt;So summarize: pure anarchy is a monster far worse than all but the most</a><br>
<i>&gt;oppressive of governments. </i><br>

<p>
So name a few anarchists who've killed tens of millions of their own
people on a whim? I didn't think you could.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;Any scheme of controlled anarchy is a stroll</i><br>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink10">&gt;along the edge of an abyss, with no past experience to guide our way.  </a><br>

<p>
<a name="3456qlink10">Oh, the horror! Life might be different to the way it is today! Gosh, I'm
so scared! Please Big Mummy, protect me from the evil anarchists and their
ungodly 'freedom'!</a>

<p>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink11">&gt;I agree that we have problems here, but getting rid of government does</a><br>
<i>&gt;nothing to solve them. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="3456qlink11">I'm not saying that getting rid of government would save DC; I'm saying 
that government cannot survive in a future with the kinds of technologies
we talk about, unless it becomes a Borganism with complete control over
ever member of that society.</a> Otherwise it's doomed.

<p>
<i>&gt;Besides, the situation isn't nearly as bad as you</i><br>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink12">&gt;seem to think (your irate group has to include some very rare specialists),</a><br>

<p>
That is scientists, technicians and military weapons experts; the very 
people *most* likely to get pissed off by overbearing governments. McVeigh,
remember, is ex-military and was taught to blow things up by the US
government.

<p>
<a href="3444.html#3449qlink13">&gt;(sensors are</a><br>
<i>&gt;improving much faster than destructive technologies, for example).</i><br>

<p>
'Mr President, sir, we've just detected a missile launch from Montana,
sensors say it's carrying a thermonuclear warhead. It'll be here in two
minutes.'

<p>
Yeah, those sensors are really going to help, I mean like at least you'll 
have time to kiss your ass goodbye before it gets vaporized. That'll be 
cool.
