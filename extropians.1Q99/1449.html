There is a well known prediction/estimation technique called Delphi
forecasting, which dates back to the 1960s.  It is designed to get an
improved group estimate.  Here is a description, from:
<a href="http://horizon.unc.edu/projects/seminars/futuresresearch/stages.asp#forecasting">http://horizon.unc.edu/projects/seminars/futuresresearch/stages.asp#forecasting</a>

<p>
<i>: First, no participant is told the identity of the other members of the</i><br>
<i>: group, which is easily accomplished if, as is common, the forecasts are</i><br>
<i>: obtained by means of questionnaires or individual interviews. When the</i><br>
<i>: Delphi is conducted in a workshop setting-one of the more productive</i><br>
<i>: ways to proceed in many cases-this rule cannot be honored, of course.</i><br>
<i>: </i><br>
<i>: Second, no single opinion, forecast, or other key input is attributed</i><br>
<i>: to the individual who provided it or to anvone else. Delphi</i><br>
<i>: questionnaires, interviews, and computer conferences all easily</i><br>
<i>: provide this protection. In the workshop setting, it is more difficult</i><br>
<i>: to ensure, but it can usually be obtained by using secret ballots or</i><br>
<i>: various electronic machines that permit anonymous voting with immediate</i><br>
<i>: display of the distribution of answers from the group as a whole.</i><br>
<i>: </i><br>
<i>: Third, the results from the initial round of forecasting must be collated</i><br>
<i>: and summarized by an intermediary (the experimenter), who feeds these</i><br>
<i>: data back to all participants and invites each to rethink his or her</i><br>
<i>: original answers in light of the responses from the group as a whole. If,</i><br>
<i>: for example, the participants have individually estimated an event's</i><br>
<i>: probability by some future year, the intermediary might compute the</i><br>
<i>: mean or median response, the interquartile range or upper and lower</i><br>
<i>: envelopes of the estimates, the standard deviation, and so forth, and</i><br>
<i>: pass these data back to the panelists for their consideration in making</i><br>
<i>: a new estimate. If the panelists provided qualitative information as</i><br>
<i>: well-for example, reasons for estimating the probabilities as they did</i><br>
<i>: or judgments as to the consequences of the event if it were actually to</i><br>
<i>: occur-the role of the intermediary would be to edit these statements,</i><br>
<i>: eliminate the redundant ones, and arrange them in some reasonable order</i><br>
<i>: before returning them for the group's consideration.</i><br>
<i>: </i><br>
<i>: Fourth, the process of eliciting judgments and estimates (deriving</i><br>
<i>: the group response, feeding it back, and asking for re-estimates in</i><br>
<i>: light of the results obtained so far) should be continued until either</i><br>
<i>: of two things happens: The consensus within the group is close enough</i><br>
<i>: for practical purposes, or the reasons why such a consensus cannot be</i><br>
<i>: achieved have been documented.</i><br>
<i>: </i><br>
<i>: In sum, the defining characteristics of Delphi are anonymity of the</i><br>
<i>: estimates, controlled feedback, and iteration. The promise of Delphi</i><br>
<i>: was that if these characteristics were preserved, consensus within the</i><br>
<i>: panel would sharpen and the opinions or forecasts derived by the process</i><br>
: would be closer to the "true" answer than forecasts derived by other<br>
: judgmental approaches.<br>
