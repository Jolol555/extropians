I endores cryonics. Without some kind of crystal ball who is to say if 
the possibilities inferred to with this technique will come to pass or 
not. If I had the chance to chose life or death (with it's the most 
healthiest of attributes) I chose life. Unable to see the future, and 
yet humble enough not to trust in it, still gives way to the possibility 
that cryonics has to offer. If there is a percentage that I could 
return, without out betting on it, I take the chance. I lose nothing, I 
have only to gain.

that

those who

these

or a

<a href="3324.html#3332qlink5">&gt;&gt;defibrillator a waste of resources because the person is obviously </a><br>
dead?
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink6">&gt;&gt;Suspension protocols are most appropriately thought of as emergency </a><br>
medical
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink7">&gt;&gt;procedures designed to save someone's life.  Emergency medical </a><br>
procedures,
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink8">&gt;&gt;in general, have varying probabilities of success.  We don't know yet </a><br>
what
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink9">&gt;&gt;that probability figure is for cryonics but we believe that it is </a><br>
certainly
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink10">&gt;&gt;greater than zero.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sorry to upset you, Scott, I'll refer to them as "the cryonically </i><br>
preserved"
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink11">&gt;whenever I think of it. For instance: When the going gets tough, the </a><br>
tough
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink12">&gt;don't ask if the cryonically preserved should live.</a><br>
<i>&gt;This follows from the fact that no one knows if the cryonically </i><br>
preserved
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink13">&gt;_can_ live.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Actually, I started this thread by asking those on the list to select </i><br>
the 5
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink14">&gt;&gt;people that they most wished would enbrace the idea of cryonics </a><br>
because the
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink15">&gt;&gt;world could ill-afford to lose their particular gifts.  There weren't </a><br>
very
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink16">&gt;&gt;many responses to _that_ question.  The issue of whether cryonic </a><br>
suspendees
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink17">&gt;&gt;should be revived or not is one that you brought up, I believe.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Right, and I had answered that, "I can think of half a dozen people </i><br>
with a
<br>
<i>&gt;talent or a gift that the world</i><br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink18">&gt;can ill afford to lose, but they don't embrace the idea of cryonics...</a><br>
<i>&gt;...IOW, the very people who have talents or gifts that the world can </i><br>
ill
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink19">&gt;afford to lose, do not endorse the idea of cryonics.</a><br>
<i>&gt;If those people don't endorse cryonics, why should extropians?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, now I ask you: Why don't people with a talent or a gift that the </i><br>
world
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink20">&gt;can ill afford to lose (candidates so far include Stephen Hawking, </a><br>
Spider
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink21">&gt;Robinson, Doug Engelbart, Robert M. Pirsig, Neal Stephenson, Douglass</a><br>
<i>&gt;Hofstadter, Martin Gardner, Arthur C. Clarke, Steven Jay Gould, and </i><br>
James
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink22">&gt;Randi) embrace the idea of cryonics? Has anyone asked _them_?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Well, for one thing, reviving a few geniuses and recruiting their </i><br>
talents
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink23">&gt;&gt;just may speed up the process of building a better human.  Besides, as </a><br>
has
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink24">&gt;&gt;been mentioned, the biotechnology that will lead to reversible </a><br>
suspensions
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink25">&gt;&gt;is going to progress anyway because there are a large number of </a><br>
medical
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink26">&gt;&gt;applications besides reviving cryonauts.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Do any of those working on speeding up the process of building a better</i><br>
<i>&gt;human embrace the idea of cryonics? How come their names haven't </i><br>
appeared?
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink27">&gt;&gt;&gt;Neither you nor I, but rather posthumans shall decide</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;ultimately. Physically and finally, we will have to die as humans in </i><br>
order
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink28">&gt;&gt;&gt;to become posthumans. So, the only thing cryonics can contribute to</a><br>
<i>&gt;extropy</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;relates to how it might help to develop transhumans, i.e., how it can</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;displace humans with posthumans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;What are you saying here?  I must die in order to become a posthuman?  </i><br>
The
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink29">&gt;&gt;human race must die to make room for post humans?  That's news to me.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;IOW, you must die as a child to become an adult, because the adult </i><br>
replaces
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink30">&gt;the child. This leads to the acknowledgment that the adult can </a><br>
understand
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink31">&gt;the child, even though the child may not understand the adult.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, I guess you could say that it means "to make room for post </i><br>
humans."
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink32">&gt;Likewise, the catepillar must die to make room for the butterfly. </a><br>
Nothing
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink33">&gt;new there. Sorry you hadn't heard of it before. Biologists call it</a><br>
<i>&gt;"metamorphosis" I think. At least they used to. Perhaps not anymore.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I can understand how I might compare a "posthuman version of me vs. </i><br>
the
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink34">&gt;&gt;current version of me" to "the current version of me vs. a 1 year-old</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;version of me".  In a sense, the 1 year-old version had to "die" to </i><br>
make
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink35">&gt;&gt;room for the current version of me.  I realize that my developmental</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;transitions have been pretty smooth so far, and I agree that future</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;transitions may be much more quantum-like.  Any transition from one </i><br>
state
<br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink36">&gt;&gt;another involves the "death" of the earlier state, but is that the </a><br>
kind of
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink37">&gt;&gt;death you're referring to?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You got it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Uh-oh.  The meme, "Death and birth eternally form the two sides of </i><br>
life."
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink38">&gt;&gt;is a particularly virulent one, and helps explain many of your views.  </a><br>
Am I
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink39">&gt;&gt;alone in considering this meme to be more Yin-Yang, dualistic,</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;polarized-thining nonsense?  I also don't believe that cryonicists </i><br>
would
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink40">&gt;&gt;advocate being frozen in a young and healthy state.  It's true that I</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;personally resent the fact that the state can prevent me from </i><br>
arranging a
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink41">&gt;&gt;cryonic suspension while I'm still alive, though.  I would want the </a><br>
option
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink42">&gt;&gt;of assisted suicide with immediate suspension if I discovered, for </a><br>
example,
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink43">&gt;&gt;that I had developed Alzheimer's or if I was terminally ill and in a </a><br>
great
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink44">&gt;&gt;amount of pain.  Why waste thousands and thousands of dollars and </a><br>
medical
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink45">&gt;&gt;resources on palliative care that is only briefly delaying my </a><br>
deanimation
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink46">&gt;&gt;when I plan on being suspended anyway?</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Good question. In addition, if birth and death do not form two sides of</i><br>
<i>&gt;life, what does? Would you make life one dimentional and linear? It </i><br>
seems
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink47">&gt;more sensible to me to take life as I find it, instead of trying to </a><br>
make it
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink48">&gt;fit some cryonic belief system. The cells in my body have all died at </a><br>
least
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink49">&gt;once during my lifetime, but the organism continues. Likewise, all </a><br>
living
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink50">&gt;humans may die during the course of the superorganism's lifetime.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Yes, grabbing the gusto is a good thing. I intend to grab it for a </i><br>
long,
<br>
<a href="3324.html#3332qlink51">&gt;&gt;long time in many different forms.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'll drink to that.</i><br>
