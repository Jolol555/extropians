<a href="3834.html#3848qlink1">&gt;Have you ever heard of the concept of "unschooling?" There is a school </a><br>
called the Sudbury Valley School which has been working this concept 
since 1970. There are several basic premises, but for the most part they 
all revolve around the fact that children WANT to learn and that all we 
as teachers and adults need to do is get the hell out of their way, 
unless they come to us with questions. There are no structured classes 
or courses of any kind, and learning takes place when the children are 
ready to learn. It is then up to the child if he needs help from a 
teacher or if he feels he can
<br>
learn better on his own. If a child wants to learn to read at age 3, 
fine.If he's not ready until he's 7, fine. If he is encouraged to be 
curious and nutured in the the right environment, he WILL learn. And, 
without the evils of tradional schooling to break him down, his 
curiousity will continue into adulthood, and he will have the confidence 
to learn whatever he desires.

I could go on and on about this topic, if anyone is interested.

I'm not so sure this would be the scholastic choice I would make for my 
child. Although I do not have children (maybe in ten years).I would want 
simply the best opprotunities for my child. If everything were left up 
to a child upon will, imagine what may come of that(or what may not). I 
do forsee the necessity for discipline, even educationally. I personally 
would want to fill my child's mind with as many new idea's and 
precievable goals for them to choose from. I would not limit a child by 
their own imagination alone, I would give them as many tools to use as 
possible. Then as my child grows, of course their choice, is their own, 
and I would love and support them no matter what that choice would be. 
But options for this future are imparative.
