No need for a physics book. It is rather simple. If you cannot concede this
point you are either supremely stupid or supremely stubborn, or both:

does not mean that it is no longer moving forward at all. A plane can easily
stall out at any speed. Stalling is the loss of laminar flow resulting in the
loss of lift to support a vehicle in flight, which results most easily from a
vehicle being at an extreme angle of attack (more than 20 or 30 degrees). When
