<i>&gt; Gov't</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But, of course, those two parties were in exactly the same line of business.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Consumer confusion really did look likely.  The MacDonald's examples to which</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;In general though, it is the intent to which the name is used which</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd massage that point to say that intent *can* prove very important but that</i><br>
<i>&gt; it does not alone resolve the question of infringement.  Courts use a mult-</i><br>
<i>&gt; factor test, only one element of which considers intent.  Innocent parties can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be held liable for duplicating non-distinctive marks.  Contrarywise, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; parties who intentionally duplicate an existing mark can be found to have put</i><br>
<i>&gt; it to a non-infringing use.  (Again, I caution that I am not here addressing</i><br>
<i>&gt; dilution.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Given that ExI is, shall we say, not the most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;well endowed think tank, someone could probably start a company called</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Extropian Holistic Nose Pickers, Inc. and not give a fig about what ExI</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;thinks or says about it, since it seems like they probably can't afford</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;to contest it in court.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In theory, a contigency-fee attorney might take ExI's case.  A party suffering</i><br>
<i>&gt; infringement can recover damages, the defendant's unjust profits, costs of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; action, and, in extreme cases, treble damages and attorney's fees.</i><br>

Hello from the suburbs of beautiful downtown Beaubier, Sask:

<p>
I, personally have been a list member for  a bit more than 2 years.

<p>
I will give you all a very short summary about what our venture is
all about.  We are a small cap venture with about 1 million $ can.
of fixed production assets located in a sparse close knit farming 
community pretty near to the junction of the north-south Montana/North
Dakota state line junction and the international boundary between
Canada and the USA.

<p>
Our aim is to revitalize a marginalized local agriculture product
base into a knowlege based product line of leading edge research
based products which we feel will become known world-wide.

<p>
<a name="1877qlink1">Nutraceutical products to combat AIDS, optimize immune function, 
normalize and resore cardivascular health, provide alternatives to
conventional immunization.  We have aspirations to commercialize
novel functional foods, and medical treatment methods.  Our agricultural
base utilizes a combination of crop production areas to harvest
permaculture crop products and selected tree materials.  The system
also creates wildlife habitat and allows commercial ecotourism and
conventional game hunting.  We also incorporate mycological products
into our product line.  We are still several months from having
a product to market but the science is good and our ambition level
is high.  If the list members are show interest we'll provide a 
more detailed overview.</a>
