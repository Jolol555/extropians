<p>
  IAN: The key word is "intelligence." I believe
  that we can say that the collective "life entity" 
  DOES display intelligence (a symptom of "mind"), 
  since evolution is a process of learning, and 
  artificial-learning systems, such as neutral 
  networks, are considered to be (more or less)
  viable examples of artificial intelligence. So 
  I believe we can say: learning &lt;=&gt; intelligence.

<p>
  If so, then we can say that the collective 
  life-entity has a measurable intelligence.
  If we can measure it, then I'd say it exists.

<p>
  Moreover, the question arises: "What in the 
  process of the evolution-of-species evolves?" 
  In short, where does this intelligence of the 
  life-entity exist, in individuals or the group?
  If it exists only in the group, then the group
  entity constitutes a viable entity and "mind."

<p>
  Do individual members of one species suddenly
  evolve into a member of a new species? NO! So
  the evolution of any one individual member of 
  species-type B into another non-B species = 0.
  Ergo: ONLY THE COLLECTIVE EVOLVES! We've thus
  isolated the learning-intelligence of evolution
   to the collective life-entity, and in
  so doing have measured something major that 
  is ONLY an attribute of the group-entity.


<p>
  If we are to contend that the collective is, 
  has, or does nothing more than each individual 
  (thus it can just be erased), then we say that
  there is no process of evolution, just a lot 
  of different individuals. Doing that we've 
  cut ourselves off from real understanding,
  and thus the no-collective-entity theory
  is false and antithetical to knowledge.
