<i>&gt; During the cold war, the USSR constitution included a guarantee</i><br>

<i>&gt; the guns (cops, federal agencies, military, and many citizens)</i><br>

Using might to enforce rights is merely one possible manner</a> of enforcing
<a name="0635qlink2">respect for natural rights. Since the right to defend oneself</a> is a natural
<a name="0635qlink3">right, using force *as an individual* to defend one's rights</a> is a matter of
<a name="0635qlink4">natural law. Using force to deprive others of rights</a> is against natural law.
<a name="0635qlink5">This shows that while force is not objectively moral or immoral,</a> it can be
<a name="0635qlink6">used to either objectively moral or immoral ends. So you see,</a> force is merely
<a name="0635qlink7">a means to an end, not the end in and of itself. "It is the right that
defends all other rights."

<p>
<a name="0639qlink1">Subjectivists try to deny that force follows from the natural right to
defense, because they want to deny the existence of natural rights.</a> Nothing
<a name="0635qlink8">scares me more than subjectivists in government positions,</a> because they are
<a name="0635qlink9">the ones who have the greatest potential to become tyrants.
