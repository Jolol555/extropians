Actually Biosphere 2 did.  The pilot experiment worked fine; the main
Biosphere
</a>
<br>
would probably have worked too except for the humorous result of building
scenery and artifical landscape.  They used concrete, which sucked the CO2
out of the air by a chemical reaction.  The shortage of CO2 got replaced by
the decomposers in the soil, which used up the oxygen in the process.

<a name="3893qlink2">The cost of the biosphere, however, isn't promising.  $300 million for six

is a lot.  Even accounting for the fact that 5/6 was ecological experiments
it's

still nearly 10 million per person, and that's on Earth, even.
