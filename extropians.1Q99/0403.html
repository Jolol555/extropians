<i>&gt; &gt;The majority of extropians on this list are in favour of perfect human</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I'd be interested to hear peoples opinions on the rights of animals.  Do you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;believe that animals have no rights and can be ignored, that animals have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;sliding scale of rights based upon their intelligence, or some other system?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         That is a tough question.  I think that domestic animals such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; dogs, cats, cattle etc. could be considered "property" of a sort.  As a</i><br>
<i>&gt; general rule, domestic animals are bought for a price and treated in</i><br>
<i>&gt; whatever way the owner wishes to treat them.  Most of the time it is in a</i><br>
<i>&gt; decent and humane fashion, though there are certainly exceptions.  If the</i><br>
<i>&gt; animal is treated well, it will provide years of enjoyment --a good</i><br>
<i>&gt; investment.  And, like any kind of "property," if it is treated poorly,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then it will have less usefulness --poor return value.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         It seems that, compared to humans, most animals have only a minimal</i><br>
<i>&gt; ability to reason with and comprehend events, and are ultimately unable to</i><br>
<i>&gt; assert themselves in any non-physical way.  Furthermore, animals are either</i><br>
<i>&gt; dependent on humans (domestic) or are predators or prey.  If they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; predators and they attack, there is little choice for a human but to defend</i><br>
<i>&gt; his life...if this means killing the animal, so be it (many on this list</i><br>
<i>&gt; would not hesitate to kill another human in the same situation.)  But that</i><br>
<i>&gt; is the nature of *any* animal --humans included.  Survival of the fittest.</i><br>
<i>&gt; By attacking, the animal has temporarily revoked its basic right to</i><br>
<i>&gt; life...it has exposed itself to the (often necessary) risk of being killed</i><br>
<i>&gt; to survive.  As for prey such as cattle etc., the same is true.  A cow has</i><br>
<i>&gt; the ability to kill a human if provoked, though a cow's disposition is</i><br>
<i>&gt; usually placid.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;         The crux of the matter is that there is no real need for a human to</i><br>
<i>&gt; kill an animal unless it is for food, or out of protection.  Animals have</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own "rights" which are shades of those possessed by humans: territories,</i><br>
<i>&gt; nourishment, procreation, survival.  Unless an animal is domestic</i><br>
<i>&gt; --property-- or game --prey-- then the way they deal with their "rights"</i><br>
<i>&gt; should be within the species and not on a human scale.</i><br>

I just had a debate on hunting with a person the other day so I'm primed for this
topic. Here is a rough synopsis of the debate:
Other Person:"While I think that its OK for people to hunt for food if they need
to to survive, anything else is just for sport and is wrong."
Mike: "Well, I think than anyone who eats meat at all but does not participate at
some point in their life in the killing of the animal and preparing the carcass is
a hypocrite. Moreover, I think that hunting is far more humane and respectful of
animal's rights than a slaughterhouse, which I associate with Nazi death camps.
All animals should be shot on the run and given a sporting chance to escape."
We were having a bite to eat, and the girl was eating some french fries, she held
one up and said,"Does that mean that since I have never picked a potato that I
should not eat french fries?"
<br>
Mike:"Have you ever picked a flower?"
<br>
Other person:"Yes, of course."
<br>
Mike:"well, then you can eat plants, can't you then?"
Other Person:"ok, thanks"
<br>
Mike:"No problem, and by the way, picking flowers is just for sport, too....."
