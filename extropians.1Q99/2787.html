I spoke with a number of my coworkers and found several who
had heard the report on CNN.  The reaction of those who heard
the report was to break out laughing.  Not one of us grokked that
message.  I found no one who could believe it.  I do not
question that hackers are clever.  Hackers are clever, and have
done some amazing capers.  Just not this one.  It would be far
easier to steal the gold outta Fort Knox.  As for an inside job,
as suggested by Anders, it would have to be a waaaay inside
job, with maaany insiders deeply involved. Apologies to Terry
and the other hijack story confirmer.  spike
