I see.  So, in other words, you're walking a totally predetermined
trajectory where your current meme system determines the meme system
you'll adopt next.  (As adjusted for your innate instincts, of course.)

<a name="0377qlink2">Your walk takes into account no sort of objective right or wrong
whatsoever, just your current set of prejudices.  If your meme system
told you to adopt a meme system that told you to nuke Cincinatti, you'd
basically have no defense.  If you'd been born a worshipper of Great
Moloch, you'd stay that way until the end of time.  You don't claim that
the truth has anything to do with what you believe, so why should I lend
credence to your beliefs, why should I think your beliefs are covariant
with the truth?</a>

<a name="0377qlink3">You could do anything, kill me or kiss your worst enemy, and deny that
reasoning has anything to do with it.  It appears as if your meme system
makes you a sentience to avoid, maybe even to terminate with extreme
prejudice.  Thank you for the warning.</a>
