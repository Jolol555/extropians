<a name="0960qlink1">I'm in error for not recalling where I read that, but I did read that 
number 3338. Maybe it was speculated the hopes of recognizing that our 
environment would have an effect as well any manipulation</a> to the aging

<a href="0921.html#0924qlink1">&gt;Hope I can prove you wrong, by having this consveration with you at the </a><br>
Far Edge Party in a mere 200,000 years.  By then, I'll probably have 
gotten bored with the human form, and gone on to something more capable 
of flight. :-)

<p>
Is this a predesignated party, or hypathetical? His is this new form you 
dream of concieved in form? Just curiouse, besides, one could always 
revert back to the primitive and human shape we originated in ,couldn't 
we!
