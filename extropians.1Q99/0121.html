If I'm not mistaken, strict Islamic Law dictates a rather severe punishment
for someone who screws up the timing of the call to prayers from the
minaret, eh? How many automated minarets are gonna fail on January 1st
cause they are run by satanic running dog Yankee computers..... I see a
holy war coming...

<p>
As for our own Y2K, its obvious that the sinful managers who decided
against four digit year programming years ago in order to meet their
performance windows to get their stock options are being punished for their
pride and arrogance, while the pious programmers who originally warned of
this but were scorned and ignored are reaping the rewards..... $150.00+ an
hour anyone? I think Scott Adams had it right that Hell and the Accounting
department are pretty much synonymous.....from whence Satan sends his
demons, devils, and imps to tempt the stupid and despoil the righteous from
acheiving capitalistic nirvana on earth....
