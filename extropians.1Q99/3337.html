<a href="3316.html#3337qlink1">&gt; And today's question is:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Where do you want to live?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Permutation City?</i><br>
<i>&gt; The Culture?</i><br>
<i>&gt; The High Beyond?</i><br>
<i>&gt; (I'm guessing these will be the top three.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or some creation of your own?</i><br>

<p>
Hmm, tricky question. I assume "everywhere" isn't a good answer, but I
relly would like to distribute myself into a wide variety of cultures,
civilizations and states :-)

<p>
Permutation City (or the polises of _Diaspora_) might be a bit too
isolationist for my taste, even if I find virtual universe
construction very enjoyable. 

<p>
The Culture is *fun*, but might become a slight bit bland - maybe I
should join Contact or that trade/assimilator offshoot mentioned in
_Excession_.

<p>
The High Beyond seems to be an interesting place - dangerous, but
filled with potential. But I might be a bit too careful and risk
aversive to get close to the Transcend.

<p>
Just like Dale I might enjoy the Logarchy. Having daemons enabling me
to work on all sorts of projects at once, uniting art with technology
in a very free way sounds like heaven. The problem might be that the
political system has its drawbacks.

<p>
Stapledon's minded planets, galaxies and universes: no thanks, his
descriptions sound somewhat boring, they just sit there being
enlightened.

<p>
David Zindell's universe: Hmm, maybe Agathange would suit me, a life
as a nanotechnologist porpoise could be fun. The Order seems a bit too
conservative, but I'm an academic at heart and sometimes enjoy
intrigue; however, they are limited from a transhuman point of
view. And of course, a life as a Hakra jupiter-brain wannabee might be
exciting (and short :-).


<p>
To sum up, I think I would like to live in the Logarchy, working to
make it more dynamic. But I sure would want to visit the other
cultures the rest of the list may end up in.
