I think you guys are mostly right, but not quite for the reason you think.

<p>
When talking among themselves, economists have long had powerful empirical 
success, used appropriate probabilistic language, and punished those who 
claim more than then can make a case for.  When they speak to policy makers
and the public, however, their declarations seem to carry little information.
A combination of mercenary behavior and ideology lets advocates find
respected economists who will say whatever they want said.  

<p>
Why haven't other fields succumbed to this problem?  I suspect it is because
they have better tied advice to responsibility.  An astronomer who claims to
be able to build a better telescope is judged by his peers at this ability
and then given the task himself.  If he can't deliver, the worse for him.
A surgeon who says he has a better procedure starts doing it himself.
An economist telling a judge how to decide a case or a legislator how to 
design a health insurance system has much worse responsibility.  Economists
hired by firms to design their insurance systems do better, as do finance 
economists working at firms where they have a personal investment stake.  

<p>
Idea futures should, as an institution, give economists a better stake in 
being right about their policy claims.  So I predict that with idea futures
economists will come to be respected as knowing a lot.  The problem is,
we aren't likely to get idea futures until folks respect economists like me
who say its a good idea to try.
