I believe that James Ganong wrote:

Robert Wright speaks to this issue in "The Moral Animal":

<p>
"It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the prevailing moral 
philosophy within many philosophy departments is nihilism."  
Due in part to..."the one-two punch Darwin delivered: the
Origin's assault on the biblical account of creation, followed 
by the Descent's doubts about the status of the moral sense."

<p>
"Sympathy, empathy, compassion, conscience, guilt, remorse, 
even the very sense of justice, [snip] - all these can now be viewed 
as vestiges of organic history on a particular planet."

<p>
"By the lights of the new Darwinian paradigm, a moral code is 
a political compromise.  It is molded by competing interest groups, 
each bringing all its clout to bear."  Moral values..."are shaped 
disproportionately by the various parts of society where power 
resides."

<p>
<a name="0523qlink1">Ridding myself of religious beliefs was a liberating and empowering
experience for me personally.  Part of that cleansing was the letting go
of the notion of objective moral values.  I highly recommend it.
