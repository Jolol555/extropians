Now *I* have no idea. :) Libertarianism is a philosophy, which in part
deals with politics (or the lack thereof).  There is also a Libertarian
Party, but it is less libertarian than it once was, and many people
(including myself) refer to ourselves as "libertarians", to distinguish
us from "Libertarians" who are part of a political party.  
Now.  
<br>
<a name="2128qlink1"><a name="2121qlink3">Given that libertarianism<a name="2731qlink1"> is the belief that force should not be used
</a>
except in self-defense, do you believe that the term is no longer
compatible with "extropy"?  If so, why has this changed (since 
*someone* put this into the extropy memeset)?</a></a>
