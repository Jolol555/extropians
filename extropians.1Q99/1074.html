Yes, they (the asteroid strike and the eruptions) date concurrently, and according
to my cousin the geologist as well as a documentary I saw on the Discovery
channel, the stress fractures from the shock wave can be found on both sides of
the planet, and simulations run on  computers show that eruptions on the opposite
side of the planet would occur with such a large strike.
