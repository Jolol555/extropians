<a href="1669.html#3544qlink1">&gt; From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt;</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As for the projects that need doing - why bother?  Is there anyone here</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the money and the will to fund a project that needs doing?  If so,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I haven't seen it.  </i><br>

<p>
So let's do something about it. Money is the key to everything
else, so we should focus on that first. Anything goes, as long
as it doesn't get you into too much trouble (as I wrote countless
times before). No BS -- get rich or die; the Singularity brakes for 
no-one...

<p>
<a href="3517.html#3544qlink2">&gt; If anyone wants to sponsor a list solely for discussion of immediate</a><br>
<i>&gt; choices faced, from which all discussion of ideology would be excluded -</i><br>
<i>&gt; and restricted (although not moderated), so that people can discuss</i><br>
<i>&gt; sensitive subjects - I'm for it.</i><br>

<p>
Well, so am I, as long as *all* potentially lucrative enterprises can
be discussed normally. In fact, does anyone know how to set
up a "re-routed" (to make more money) phone (sex) line, and the
legal aspects of this?
