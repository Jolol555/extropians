<p>
The Oxford Companion to Philosophy likewise says "Atheism is 
ostensibly the doctrine that there is no God." This seems to be the 
common way the term is used, and you get it if you parse 
atheism: (a-the)-ism.

<p>
<a name="0374qlink3"><a href="0345.html#0369qlink2">&gt; As you note, an agnostic is one without knowledge.</a><br>

<p>
The Companion states: "Agnosticism may be strictly personal ond 
confessional -- 'I have no firm belief about God' -- or it may be the 
more ambitious claim that no one ought to have a positive belief for 
or against divine existence." So this is about belief, not knowledge.</a>

<p>
<a name="0374qlink4">If you define an agnostic as one without knowledge about God, it 
follows that there does not exist any agnostics (since knowing that 
P implies that P is true), so that is a bad definition and not in 
agreement with common usage.</a>

<p>
<a name="0380qlink1">I used to say that I was an atheist, but I've changed my mind and now 
I'm just an agnostic. This is partly because of the possibility that 
our world is a simulation; the posthumans running the simulation 
could well be said to be gods.</a> There is also the possibility 
<a name="0380qlink2">that all possible worlds exist; then gods would exist since there are 
gods in some possible worlds. Or if the universe is spatially 
infinite, which it is on the simplest topology if it is open (which 
it seems to be) then random fluctuations should lead to the 
existence of godlike physical creatures somewhere (but would these 
be real gods?).</a> And there is the possibility that there might be a 
<a name="0380qlink3">kind of neoplatonistic god, a "creative principle" which might 
explain why the world exists (though I think that looks highly 
</a>problematic).
