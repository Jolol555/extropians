<a href="0586.html#0598qlink1">&gt; A second example:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ---</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Transhuman drinking song" by Max M ;-)</i><br>
...
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0586.html#0598qlink2">&gt; Here the title is a contradiction in terms as transhumanism and drinking</a><br>
<i>&gt; parties generally doesn't mix to well. I am thinking about all the focus on</i><br>
<i>&gt; health, longivity and the functionality of the brain being seriously</i><br>
<i>&gt; affected by liquor. At least I don't imagine transhumans at the local pub</i><br>
<i>&gt; singing out loud while massively drunk. Could be wrong though.</i><br>

<p>
Maybe we should ask the participants at TransVision 98 who went to
Amsterdam on saturday evening :-)

<p>
(my personal view is that I'm too drunk if I can't count backwards
from 16 in binary. No, I don't drink :-)

<p>
<a href="0586.html#0598qlink3">&gt; Perhaps the receiver would even have to know me to know it is not</a><br>
<i>&gt; meant to be taken too seriously.</i><br>

<p>
This is likely why humor is so tricky; it relies on some shared
context. If it isn't shared and has to be made explicit, the joke is
not funny.

<p>
<a href="0586.html#0598qlink4">&gt; The rest of the song is about uploading, and most transhumans will recognise</a><br>
<i>&gt; this. Especially as the word Transhuman is in the title.</i><br>

<p>
Where is the rest of the lyrics? 
 
<p>
<a href="0586.html#0598qlink5">&gt; My point? I find that often when somebody disagrees with me on a subject on</a><br>
<i>&gt; this list, it is because I make my messages too short by using too much</i><br>
<i>&gt; exformation. When I then later explains my views in more detail and with</i><br>
<i>&gt; more precise information, generally we either agree or at least agree to</i><br>
<i>&gt; disagree.</i><br>

<p>
Sounds a bit like the occasional comments from newcomers about
Eugene's denser posts - we oldtimers have learned to parse them and
realize that there is a meaning in there.


<p>
<a href="0586.html#0598qlink6">&gt; Furthermore we also need to invent more words to express the new memes</a><br>
<i>&gt; resulting from this exformation. But then... we probably will. There is</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardly a post on the list without a "" word. A so called "embryomeme".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Remember who coined that one. ;-)</i><br>

<p>
Recorded.
