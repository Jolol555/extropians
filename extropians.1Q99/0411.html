<a name="0430qlink1">Organized agriculture imposes far greater harm on the environment than either
subsistence or sport hunting or fishing. Just because agriculture does</a> its deeds
<a name="0430qlink2">by slowly, methodically tearing up the wilderness, burning the flora,</a> tilling it
<a name="0430qlink3">under, then poisoning it to death with artificial fertilizers and pesticides,
which drain off into undeveloped wildernesses within the same</a> watersheds makes
<a name="0430qlink4">it no different, and even more heinous and underhanded than</a> the sporting contest
<a name="0430qlink5">of animal (who happens to be human) hunting animal. The major part</a> of transhuman
<a name="0430qlink6">sentiment which I object to is the continued insistence that man is separate
from nature. It is not, nor will it ever be. We evolved</a> as bilateral omnivores,
<a name="0430qlink7">(male hunters, female gatherers), so being carnivorous is as much</a> a part of our
<a name="0430qlink8">nature as eating plant matter.

<p>
Vegetarianism also damages the environment because it displaces</a> other species in
<a name="0430qlink9">the pyramid of life. The prairies which could be supporting millions</a> of buffalo,
<a name="0430qlink10">prairie hens, quail, wolves, coyotes, and eagles are instead</a> feeding millions of
<a name="0430qlink11">city dwelling corn flake eaters. This practice decreases diversity, creating
monocultures both in the species being preyed upon (the plants,</a> as hybrid wheat,
<a name="0430qlink12">corn, etc) and in the species doing the preying (homogenized humanity).</a>

<p>
I have often thought that the reason why vegans are so opposed to carnivorous
humans is that they feel the instinctual fear that the herbivore has of the
carnivore, and are merely trying to legislate the 'threat' out of existence.

<p>
<a name="0439qlink1">It will be interesting to see if, in our desperation to fill every natural
niche, we use our technology to develop humans that photosynthesize. If so, I
imagine that as more of the population shifts to such a lifestyle, there will be
increasing calls to outlaw the eating of plants by vegans, they will argue that
it is immoral to prey upon innocent plants (who can feel pain, as even current
science has shown, are territorial, and defend themselves with poisons, both as
irritants and toxic pesticides) with arguments like: "This type of predation is
so foreign to me that I am deeply saddened by this type of activity and
represents a sub-human psychology in killing life just for fun."</a>
