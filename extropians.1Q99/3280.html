<a name="3311qlink1">Here are some current musings of mine.

<p>
Transhumanism - The philosophy which advocates achieving complete control over
myself and my environment in order to improve (as I define improvement)</a>
myself.

<p>
<a name="3311qlink2">Some Transhuman philosophical challenges:
<pre>
1)  Who am I? (the defining of the self)
2)  How do I determine if another entity in my environment has a self?
3)  How do I interact with others with a self who are in the same environment?

</pre>
<p>
Obviously, working toward the first definition wouldn't be ethically difficult
if it weren't for the fact that there seems to be other beings with a sense of
self in my environment, and this leads to the question, "If I have the right
to control myself and my environment, don't they?  But if they are in my
environment, then they are a part of my environment, so don't I need to
control them?  And if they are in my environment, aren't I in their
environment, and thus something they need to control?  Maybe if I left out
that part about my environment and focused on myself....but wait, I am rather
strongly embedded in my environment, in fact on some levels it is difficult to
discern where I stop and the environment starts, and it is awefully hard</a> to
totally control my life without at least some control of my environment....uh
oh.

<p>
Extropianism - a broad theory of how best to achieve &gt;H goals based on the
concept that rationality, extreme decentralization, and maximization of free
and copious flows of information and resources provides the best environment
to foster Transhumanism.

<p>
These are just some working ideas....I would love some feedback.
