<p>
Incremental leaps in life extension may prepare us, as long as there are no
'quantum leaps' (these tend to create problematic knee-jerk reactions). AI
before uploading is the only route to social acceptance in my view, as long
as AI isn't seen as an automating job-destroying menace. And only if AI is
sociable, it could turn out that invisible computers are better than talking
ones (I'd bet money on it).

Even if you do think uploading is possible you're still faced with hundreds
of currently unanswerable questions.</a></a>
