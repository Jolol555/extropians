Look, obviously I can't offer personal evidence about every company in the
world.  I can say that my own company, which is one of the most incompetent,
dysfunctional, directionless organizations I have ever seen, has
nevertheless managed to tackle the problem successfully.  I was in charge of
the Unix side of our compliance program, and I can testify that all of our
mission-critical systems were ready by September of 1998.  We're currently
at the level of doing BIOS fixes on older PCs and date-testing some
low-priority embedded systems.  The way things are going now, we won't even
notice the date change.

<p>
Everyone else is doing exactly the same thing.<a name="1746qlink1">  I remember talk about the
embedded-systems problem in the power industry back in '97, and I wasn't
even an insider.</a>  The same is true of other critical industries.  Most of
the 'woeful unpreparedness' talk I've heard comes from people who are simply
trying to work up a panic to sell their pet solution.

<p>
The only people with real problems are those that fall into one of these
groups:


<OL>
  <li>  Organizations that are totally reliant on huge, byzantine, totally
antiquated software systems that no one really understands.  A lot of these
orgs migrated to newer systems over the last few years, and a few of them
fixed the programs they have.  The late starters don't have time now for
either solution.  Fortunately there are very few such organizations - the
average corporate database system doesn't even come close to fitting the
bill.

  <li>  Organizations that dismissed the whole problem as a fantasy until it was
too late.  The Doomsayers talk a lot about this, but I can't think of a
single private organization I know anything about that has done it.  Y2K
readiness became a big issue for most people by early '98, which left plenty
of time to fix everything.


</OL>
<p>
<a href="1741.html#1745qlink3">&gt; As far as I'm aware most gas stations have generators, so this shouldn't</a><br>
<i>&gt; be a problem. However, the gas still has to be shipped into the country,</i><br>
<i>&gt; refined, shipped around along potentially blocked and lawless highways.</i><br>
<i>&gt; That might be a problem, might not.</i><br>

<p>
You are creating a problem by assuming it already exists.  Before you can
conjure up a landscape filled with abandoned cars and roving packs of
looters, you need to show that there are severe enough problems to actually
create such conditions.

<p>
What I'm trying to point out is that modern civilization simply is not that
fragile.<a name="1746qlink2">  There is no way to create the kind of total paralysis that the Y2K
Doomsayers like to conjure up, and that means you can never get to the Mad
Max situation in the first place.</a>
