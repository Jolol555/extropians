<a href="2737.html#2760qlink1">&gt;&gt; Not to open a hornet's nest, but my comrades and I were certain</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that cowardice was at the root of the protester's actions.</i><br>

<p>
I think the most likely commonality of most protesters was just
an emotional, non-rational desire for non-conformity; the same
kind of kids who today are piercing and painting everything and
keeping Anne Rice in business.  I'm sure there were some who were
motivated by cowardice, and I know at least one counterexample
to both: my mother, one of the most courageous people I have ever
known, who not only protested the war but did so while living on
an Air Force base while my father was off fighting it.  I think
she even made Nixon's enemies list.

<p>
Even at the time, without hindsight, some arguments against the
war were quite rational.  Particularly the argument that if it
were indeed a just war, why the limits?  Why the secrecy?  Why
the deception of the public?  Any time the government does
something covertly, it should be questioned vigorously.  I was
too young to fight, but I knew many people on both sides who
were motivated by honest beliefs, and many on both sides who
were motivated by cowardice or ignorance.  I don't think
either was the "root" of their cause. 

<p>
(For the sake of evaluating my historical point of view and that
of others who may enter this thread, I was born in 1963.)
