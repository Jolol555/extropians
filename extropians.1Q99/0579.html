Really?

<p>
I believe Mike Lorrey has proposed a satisfactory approach to an objective
standard.</a>

<p>
Liking the outcome of something is not the same as liking the something.</a>

<p>
I asked:

Samael responds:
<br>
<a href="0487.html#0579qlink8">&gt;i'm not _entitled_ to anything.  I have no rights, except as a social</a><br>
<i>&gt;construct agreed between two or more people.  Rights are an _invention_.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You can't point to one, or hold one up or stick a needle into it.  It's a</i><br>
<i>&gt;theoretical creation of the human minds.</i><br>

<p>
There are any number of things we can't point to, hold up or stick a needle
into. Love, cooperation, life, the mind, to name an important handful. Are
all these just theoretical creations of our minds?

<p>
<a href="0487.html#0579qlink9">&gt;I keep pointing out that I don't believe these things exist and then you</a><br>
ask
<br>
<a href="0487.html#0579qlink10">&gt;me where they are.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0487.html#0579qlink11">&gt;I feel like I'm stuck with a bad copy of Eliza:</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0487.html#0579qlink12">&gt;Me:  I don't believe in morals</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0487.html#0579qlink13">&gt;You: That's a rather immoral thing to say.</a><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Ack!</i><br>

<p>
:-) Point taken, but that's not quite what I've been trying to do. I've
given what I consider grounds for believing in objective ethics.

<p>
<a name="0625qlink8"><a href="0487.html#0579qlink14">&gt;Sorry, if I'm causing offence, but I'm still waiting for one example for a</a><br>
<i>&gt;purely logical basis for morals or ethics that does not depend on what</i><br>
you,
<br>
<a href="0487.html#0579qlink15">&gt;I or anyone else thinks or feels.</a><br>

<p>
No offense taken. Again I'll point out that I've proposed the evolutive
point of view as a starting point for developing an objectively verifiable
ethical code. While incomplete in itself, I think that, when combined with
game-theoretical considerations, it may make possible an approach with
considerable persuasive power for most reasonable people, at least in broad
outline.</a>

<p>
More on this when I have time to get my thoughts together.
