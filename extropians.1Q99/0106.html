Christian nuts more or less conquered most of the other religious
nuts over the last ~500 (christian) years.  The islamic calendar
<a name="0111qlink1">is still used as the official calendar by some muslim</a> states, and
at least the islamic and chinese calendars are widely used for
unofficial purposes throughout the world.  I recall reading that
before a calendar reform was instituted in India shortly after
independence there were a few dozen calendars being used there.
