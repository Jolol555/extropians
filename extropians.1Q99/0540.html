I also remember seeing a show that discussed another type of bird.  I don't
remember the species but it was a common North American bird always
thought to be the kind that mated for life.  Turns out the females who did
not
<br>
get the primo males on the first round picks went ahead and formed nests
with the less than desirable males.  IOW, they settled.  But when these less
than desirable males were away from the nest on some project, the females
flew to the nests of the more desirable males and got impregnated.  This
was easy to verify when the DNA of the eggs were examined.  Do the
ideas of infidelity or adultery seem "illusory" in this case?

<p>
I recall this story because it struck pretty damn close to home for me.
