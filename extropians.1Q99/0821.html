<i>&gt;From: "Sean Parker" &lt;seanp@uu.net&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Subject: RE: The "New Golden Rule"</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;"I will not do to you, Mr. Pacifist, what you do not want me, Mr.</i><br>
Masochist, to do to you, because I would not do to you, what I &gt;would not
want you to do to me."

<p>
I agree with the above, but it turns a positive and proactive statement into
a negative one...the following is what I actually use as a social template.


<p>
            "Do unto others they way they want, if not harmful to them or
others."

<p>
(self is in the set of "others")

<p>
This statement requires that I work hard to know myself to a significant
degree and in real time, and make myself care enough to have an active
knowledge of the other person and their wishes.

<p>
This has helped me immensely in being clear on how to treat my wife of 25
years. When I  treated her the way **I'd** want to be treated, it rarely
seemed to work. She wanted to be treated the way SHE wanted to be treated.
Too obvious...now, I focus on
<br>
her...not how I feel or what I'd want. And, the bonus is - I'm getting what
I want much more often. and I feel better about it at the same time. Works
for me...
