We can only find out by cloning a human.

Right, and the cryonically preserved may constitute starting from scratch,
since experimental models will precede reviving those in suspension. IOW,
after several cycles of enhancing, augmenting, and amplifying mobile humans,
going back to the cryonically preserved would indeed seem like starting from
scratch.

<p>
Only natural law never dies. By natural law I mean the fundamental
principles of existence, laws of physics and chemistry. So to the degree
humans incorporate natural law in their lives, they attain immortality.
