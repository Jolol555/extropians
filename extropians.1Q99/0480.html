<p>
As reported in the Washington Post today, Icelands' government has 
agreed to a potential deal with Roche Holding AG and other 
pharmaceutical companies and researchers to utilize a central database of 
their citizen's DNA.  Because of geographical and historical factors, 
Iceland has maintained a genetic uniformity that would allow for easier 
gene prospecting.  Many Icelandic politicians view this as a way of 
cultivating a new national resource to alleviate economic problems of 
high unemployment and scarce natural resources.  

<p>
Kari Stefansson, CEO of deCODE Genetics proposed the plan and would 
hold a 12-month monopoly on data marketing rights.  He proposes that 
individual identification data would not be removed from the DNA coding 
within the database, but rather heavily encoded to maintain privacy.  
Individuals have a period of time in which to ' opt out', and after 
that all of their medical information would be recorded in the 
database after blood is drawn.  

<p>
As you can imagine, this has precipitated a complex public policy 
debate, with several ethics and privacy groups raising significant 
objections about the structure of the database.  A government committee 
has been established to hash out these issues.  This will definitely 
be a story to follow in the next year.
