I'm taking an online class right now (my college offers a few, mostly in 
the English and Math departments).  The one I am taking is a literature 
class.  Our class uses a discussion board to discuss the different works 
we are reading.  Compared to a live classroom it has some benefits and 
drawbacks.  One of the benefits is the ability to focus your thoughts. 
Another benefit is the ability to ponder for a while what someone else 
said.  One of the drawbacks is that a person can ramble on and on about 
something nobody cares about.  In a regular classroom the instructor can 
guide the discussion.  I would have to say the best benefit is the fact 
that a person's arguments are judged on the arguments alone, not on what 
they happen to be wearing that day or if they have a really annoying 
voice.  These types of classes are only useful to those people who are 
motivated to keep up.  You don't have an instructor giving you dirty 
looks for not doing your work.  Most of the people who take these 
classes have many other engagements to keep, such as family and work, 
and so the flexibility is very useful to them.  Basically the form of 
the class is very much like this mailing list except that the discussion 
board is a little more organized.  If you want to check it out go to:
