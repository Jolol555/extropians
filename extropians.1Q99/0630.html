I don't know, but I am researching this with some mental health experts, so
I will get back to you on this. In the meantime, here are some interesting
statistics which I found in an article on the AWARE (Arming Women Against
Rape and Endangerment) Home page, linked below:

<a name="1317qlink1"><i>&gt; Again abstracting from Covey's excellent essay "Gun Stats and Mortal Risks", there are many</i><br>
<i>&gt; different ways to look at the limited data that is available on firearm use. Using very</i><br>
<i>&gt; reasonable, non-garbage, ways of looking at the data, Covey came up with the following</i><br>
<i>&gt; fascinating figures:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A gun is 32 times more likely to be used to defend against criminal threat than to kill anybody.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A gun is 245 times more likely to be used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat</i><br>
<i>&gt; than to commit criminal homicide.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A gun is 535 times more likely to be used to defend against criminal threat than to accidentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; kill anybody!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A gun is 50 times more likely to be used to defend against criminal threat than to kill another</i><br>
<i>&gt; person.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; A gun is 50 times more likely to be used to defend against criminal threat than to be used in</i><br>
<i>&gt; suicide.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, all of this was too long to pack into a letter-to-the-editor of Vogue, so I picked out</i><br>
<i>&gt; just the most important point, and tried to explain it. I don't know whether Vogue will print the</i><br>
<i>&gt; letter I hammered out in response to their tripe, but I thought you all might be interested in it:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Dear Vogue,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     As the holder of a PhD in Applied Mathematics, I am more than competent to read</i><br>
<i>&gt;     and analyze the research materials published about the use of firearms. As the author</i><br>
<i>&gt;     of two of the articles in the issue of Women&amp;Guns magazine that was pictured in</i><br>
<i>&gt;     your misleading article about firearms, I am moved to point out just one of the many</i><br>
<i>&gt;     refutations of the fallacy that bad uses of guns outnumber good ones by 43 to 1.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Would you rate the quality of your local police department by the number of</i><br>
<i>&gt;     criminals the police kill every year? Of course not! A better measure would be the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     number of arrests made, or convictions obtained, because that is the primary job of</i><br>
<i>&gt;     the police; killing in the line of duty is extremely uncommon. Similarly, it is wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt;     to rate the "goodness" of guns in the hands of law-abiding people by the number of</i><br>
<i>&gt;     home invaders they kill. A better measure would be the number of crimes thwarted</i><br>
<i>&gt;     by the presence of a defensive firearm, even if nobody was shot or killed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Fortunately, those numbers are available. The best independent statistics come from</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Professor Gary Kleck(*), a criminologist at Florida State University. He shows that</i><br>
<i>&gt;     there are a million defensive uses of firearms a year, and in the overwhelming</i><br>
<i>&gt;     majority of cases, the criminal is stopped by the presence of the gun, without anyone</i><br>
<i>&gt;     being killed. Taking this into account, the good uses of firearms outnumber the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     accidental deaths by 535 to one! Of course, gun ownership is not for everyone. If</i><br>
<i>&gt;     you live in a household with someone who is violent, depressed, or abuses drugs,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     adding a firearm to the home can indeed be a danger, because most people who</i><br>
<i>&gt;     murder have a history of criminal violence or drug involvement. Anyone who is</i><br>
<i>&gt;     considering the purchase of a firearm should get training from a qualified, certified</i><br>
<i>&gt;     instructor (not a 16-year old neighbor). Women&amp;Guns has a resource list that can</i><br>
<i>&gt;     help people find such instructors, and also has accounts of women who have</i><br>
<i>&gt;     successfully defended themselves with firearms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Sincerely,</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Lyn Bates</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (*) Gary Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America, Aldine de Gruyter, 1992. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; author states at the beginning of this scholarly book that he "is a member of the American Civil</i><br>
<i>&gt; Liberties Union, Amnesty International USA, and Common Cause, among other politically</i><br>
<i>&gt; liberal organizations. He is a lifelong registered Democrat, as well as a contributor to liberal</i><br>
<i>&gt; Democratic political candidates. He is not now, nor has he ever been, a member of, or a</i><br>
<i>&gt; contributor to, the National Rifle Association, Handgun Control Inc., or any other advocacy</i><br>
<i>&gt; group on either side of the gun control issue, nor has he received funding for research from any</i><br>
<i>&gt; such organization."</i><br>
