Because while food, unlike oxygen, takes a lot of hard work to raise, to
prepare, to store, to transport, etc. If oxygen took that much work, you
would have to pay for it too. See Heinlein's _The Moon Is A Harsh
Mistress_. TANSTAAFL. On Earth, oxygen is about the only free lunch a
human being gets in life, and even then it tends to get dirty.....that
which is free tends to trend toward lower quality...

<p>
You might also argue that the answer to the question of what good is
government is just that. Governments use force to make you pay taxes. If
you fail to pay your taxes, in the old days, they could deprive you of
your ability to breath....with cold iron. Government markets in the sale
of the breath of life, and backs it up with force.

<p>
If God had meant all children to eat freely, he would have made them with
leaves....
