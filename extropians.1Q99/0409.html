<a name="0426qlink2">(?)  I do have to worry about that, since I'm still a mortal.  But I
don't think so.  I'll pay you a sincere compliment and assume that you
were genuinely trying to make a point of evolutionary psychology, at the
same level of facility I had a few years ago, rather than using a
debating tactic.</a>

<p>
<a name="0426qlink3">I was simply echoing a point you made back at you; that if you feel
threatened by a specific set of memes ("Nuke K-Mart"), then there's also
a threat in any meme system which assumes a random trajectory.  I'd feel
nervous around someone who insisted that reality is only a matter of
opinion, wouldn't you?  He might decide that sulfuric acid was good for me.</a>

<p>
Not in the slightest.  There are people who follow predetermined walks
with respect to their opinions; we call it "blind faith", not "Free Opinion".

<a name="0426qlink5"><a href="0377.html#0409qlink3">&gt; Personally I use the meme system of scientific exploration called rational</a><br>
<i>&gt; empirism.  This system defines "truth" as the model matching the outer world</i><br>
<i>&gt; and checks the truth value of the model by making experiments. I understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; it has been rather successful during the last centuries.</i><br>

<p>
But you don't use that meme system to determine the truth of supergoals,
only of opinions and subgoals.  I use that meme system to determine what
I do as well as what I say.</a>
