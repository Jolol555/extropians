<p>
The problem is that two particles can't communicate with each other when they're
arbitrarily close together. The smaller the wavelength of light the greater
the energy it has and thus it's mass,  remember E =MC^2 so M= E/c^2.
Thus at some point the wavelength is so small and the mass is so great that
gravitational effects become important and  a mini Black Hole is formed with a
singularity at its center. Today's physics can't say anything about things
smaller than the Plank Length of 10^-33 cm, or anything about  time shorter
than the time light takes to travel that distance, the Plank Time of 5.4 * 10^-44 sec.
On the other hand modern physics can't say anything about what's going
on inside the singularity either so perhaps there is some small hope for infinite
computation there.
