<p>
<a name="0547qlink2">Of course distinctions exist between choices and consequences.
What does that have to do with the existence of some immutable,
objective morality.</a>  The phrase "I don't know it doesn't exist, either."
is hardly a justification for seeking out some imagined construct
like objective morality.  I don't know that God doesn't live in a ranch
style on my side of town, but I'm not going to start knocking on
doors...just in case he is.

<p>
<a href="0529.html#0539qlink3">&gt;The alternative is believing in my own prejudices, which is outright</a><br>
<i>&gt;silly.  I know where my innate preferences come from, to wit: evolution,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and I trust evolution's design for my mind no more than I trust its</i><br>
<i>&gt;design for my body.  There is no distinction between doing what</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0547qlink3">Agreed.  I want to be free of the psychological dictates of evolutionary
processes as well as the more artificial, religious proposals of an
immutable morality.  We are process, and any moral system will
ultimately evolve to reflect changes in that process.</a>
