I said his acts were used as a propaganda piece to turn public opinion against
the burgeoning militia movement. As I recall, there were a LOT of ticked off
people after Ruby Ridge and Waco, even a lot of liberals I know. The assault
weapons ban was picking up steam, and sales levels of guns was up 30%. A friend
of mine made a nice pile importing some 20,000 SKS rifles in from Vietnam.

At the time, Clinton had his lowest approval rating, his cabinet members and
administration officials were either resigning, being indicted, or winding up
dead, and he spent his time increasing people's taxes, trying to impose a
socialist health care system on us, and taking more guns away, while his old
maid AG was off saving children from allegedly abusive parents by burning them
alive.....
