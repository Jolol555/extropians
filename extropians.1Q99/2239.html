Does it?

My personal experience is that most of the "functional"
psychologists I've encountered did not enter the
profession with a mission to "analyze" themselves into 
psychological well-being.   There is a common (and 
unfortunate) perception that  we go into this field to 
"deal with" our own devils.  While I understand why a 
client may prefer to have a therapist with a broad 
array of life experiences, I do not feel crippled because 
I have failed to suffer some psychopathology.

<p>
<a name="2247qlink1">More to the point, I would advise someone interested in 
Psychology to pursue a position as an academician/
researcher rather than that of a practitioner.  This branch 
of science is so immature.</a>  Actually, I suspect that it's 
more likely that a strong AI will figure us out before we do.
But by that time, we'll transcend our psychological 
limitations and the point will be moot.

<p>
Of course I could be wrong.  :-)

<p>
<a name="2247qlink2">BTW Tim, Demon Seed also struck me as a memorable film.

<p>
Caution!!! . . . . . .  Demon Seed Spoiler Follows . . . . . . Caution!!!

This was my first true exposure to the inevitability of computergenerated
 consciousness.  There were so many great themes:
the merging of machine and human, rebirth through the fathering 
of one's own self, and I thought it was particularly interesting that 
while many transhumanists look forward to become more machinelike,
 this AI sought to be more human-like . . . to be "alive".  Of 
course that theme is a very vain and human-like theme.  Why would
an AI want to be "alive"?  It's such a high-maintenance state to exist 
in.

I also loved it because I was crazy about Julie Christie back then.
