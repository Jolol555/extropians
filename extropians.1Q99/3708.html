<p>
Simple, it's extremely difficult to stay in ones field and not branch out.
Scientists reward those who do not give in to temptation and shun those who
do. Science is not about making sweeping generalisations in fields you do
not understand, unless you’re a physicist.

<p>
I'm not sure of Drexler's political policy now but I found EOC and UTF to be
somewhat naive when concerned with economics and politics. The approach the
Foresight Institute takes now is AFAIK purely educational but that is likely
to change. I find this worrying; people are all to eager to come forward
with the (grossly speculative) dangers of their research and this could lead
to government intervention. I would personally rather be sorry than safe.

<p>
Obviously it won't last; Drexler has done too much to advance the field to
be ignored.

What about engineers?
