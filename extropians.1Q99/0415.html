Okay, we've taken it back a step:  Rape is wrong because it's a violation of
our bodies.

(who can keep saying "why?" until people realise that there isn't a moral
that one can't say "why?" about and therefore isn't a logical foundation to
morals, the only foundation we have is emotional)

<p>
Oh, and before you accus me of being a nasty man, I don't want my body
violated either, thank you very much and don't intend to violate yours
(except in certain limited circumstances).  Just because I don't see a
logical reason to avoid something, doesn't mean that there isn't an
emotional one.
