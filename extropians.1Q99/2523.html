<a name="2529qlink1">Personally, I think that anyone who wants to be elitist about the list has an
already existing alternative: join the extropians-select list. Thats kinda the
point of it. You want more signal, less noise, then join ExI and join the select
<a name="2529qlink2">list.</a> The prime purpose of this public unmoderated list is its public relations
value. ExI doesn't need a full time PR flack to deal with public queries. There
are already several dozen people here who can answer and debate their questions
for free.</a>

<p>
ANyone who is expecting high signal to noise ratios on a free unmoderated list
is kidding themselves. TANSTAAFL.
