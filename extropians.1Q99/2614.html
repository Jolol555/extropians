<a name="2624qlink1">Actually, I think that it has been established that the earliest
religious rituals had to do with hunting.  Ritual dances were held with
a shaman dressed in the animal skin, and a mock killing would occur.

<p>
I believe that these rituals were actually practice.  I think the shaman
dressing in the animal skins would lead the others into the ritual of
the hunt.  They would be trained how to hunt, how to hide, how to sneak
up on the kill.</a>  The leader could see whose aim was better, who could
hide well, who could run fast, and who was weak.  He could predict that
the best aimers would hit the animal with spears first.  He could
predict who could keep up with a running animal, and who couldn't.  He
could predict who could sneak up on an animal, and who couldn't.  He
would choose the best hunting teams.  Although the non-alpha males may
not have realized what was going on, they did learn that after going
through rituals beforehand, their hunts went better.  Those who
practiced ritual got kills more often.  Those who didn't perform ritual
did not fare so well.  Those teams picked by the shaman worked together
best.  Those not chosen by the shaman might tag along, but wouldn't do
so well.  

<p>
I think the early animal shamanism evolved out of the basic hunt for
food.  The idea of the totem grew out of the practice animal effigies
made of animal skins.  Those who paid homage to these totems got the
kill.  Those who did not did not get the kill.  The basics of religious
belief are all there, but the rationale behind the rituals were lost on
many members.<a name="2664qlink1">  They just developed faith that if they did as the shaman
instructed, it would be better.  It was not an irrational belief,
because it really worked.</a>

<p>
<a name="2624qlink2">I have similar theories about agriculture religions evolving from the
sky watchers who told people when it was time to plant, when it was time
to harvest, and when it was time to store food.  Those that obeyed the
astrologers did better than those who did not listen to their
predictions.</a>
