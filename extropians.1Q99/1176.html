<i>&gt; Of course it could.  IMHO, you don't even need nanotech brain surgery to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; it.  People actually seem to be pretty easy to influence, as long as you</i><br>
<i>&gt; approach the problem the right way.  The hard part would be developing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; technique for testing the effectiveness of competing approaches in an</i><br>
<i>&gt; objective fashion.  Once you have that, experimenters can begin building a</i><br>
<i>&gt; sound base of knowledge in the field.  Once you have enough empirical data</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be able to say you know how to do some limited set of things reliably,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you have an engineering discipline.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1188qlink1">You mean like the psychology of persuasion/attitude change or
advertisement psychology? Both are areas where quite a bit of serious
reasearch is going on. But most of it is non-memetic, i.e. relies on
direct exposure rather than spread from other people.</a>

<p>
<a href="1158.html#1176qlink2">&gt; &gt; Why or why not?  What could happen if it were so developed?</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's the catch.  Memetic engineering would could benefit us all by making</i><br>
<i>&gt; it possible to build better mental immune systems, weed out false memes more</i><br>
<i>&gt; reliably, and so on.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1188qlink2">Actually, this is an interesting angle to add in the above fields, how
to create a mindset able to resist these methods. There are publishable
research papers</a> in it :-)

<p>
<a href="1158.html#1176qlink3">&gt; BTW - This is one reason why some of us are so nervous about the idea of</a><br>
<i>&gt; confronting an SI.  Circumstantial evidence seems to suggest that humans</i><br>
<i>&gt; have very weak mental immune systems.  An entity a great deal smarter than</i><br>
<i>&gt; we are might well be able to exploit those weaknesses to manipulate us into</i><br>
<i>&gt; doing just about anything, just by engaging in conversation that leads</i><br>
<i>&gt; subtly in the desired direction.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1188qlink3">Note that this is a skill that hinges very sensitively on being able
to participate in human social contexts, judging reactions from small
cues and modelling the reactions of a human. SIs are only dangerous in
this respect if you believe that intelligence is completely general,
and not specialized (which is becoming a more and more common view
among psychologists).</a>
