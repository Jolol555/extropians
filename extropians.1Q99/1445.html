The fact that they have already come up more than once seems to 
favor my point of view. :)  I just noticed them this last time, but as no
action was taken, I didn't think much of it.  Actually, without your 
assertion that those who run the site back the idea of eliminating
anonymity, I would have assumed that "Anonymous Coward" was
self-depreciative humor.
