There is more involved in ethics than a simple consideration of one's own

<i>&gt;number of species and individuals in the world allows for more complexity</i><br>

<i>&gt;me that I should avoid killing off less powerful entities, since I find</i><br>
<i>&gt;pleasure in increasing my knowledge of the world, and their evolution to</i><br>
<i>&gt;a higher power would make them and/or their species more interesting later.</i><br>
