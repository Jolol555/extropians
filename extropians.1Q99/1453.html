<p>
Good news! After some shuffling and negotiating, I have confirmed a booking
of conference space for EXTRO 4. We will hold the conference at U.C.
Berkeley, at the Joseph Wood Crutch Theatre on the Clark Kerr campus.

<p>
Rooms are available on campus, and will cost much less than a hotel room.
More details soon. It would help us if we had a better idea of how many
people will want an on-campus room, since we may need to increase our
reservations. If you're already sure you're coming and will want to stay on
campus, please let us know.

<p>
I will soon put up a web page with continually updated information on the
conference. For now, a reminder that it will happen on August 7-8 this
year. Those travelling from further away will want to arrive on Friday 6th.
The event will be finished by late afternoon on Sunday the 8th.

<p>
My thanks to Natasha Vita More for suggesting that we hold the conference
on a campus. I think this will make a good environment, and will cost less
for travellers than the usual venues.

<p>
Onward!

<p>
Max
