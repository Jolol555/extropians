built for the job, and there are at least a dozen bolt action rifle models available
on the market made for the round today, that any civilian can buy. Cost is between
$5000-$10000 per rifle. An individual round goes for between $5.00-25.00.

Nope, shaped charge warheads are the way to go unless you have hypersonic crowbars.
