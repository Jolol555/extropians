<a name="2175qlink1">If you really want that sentence then it really should read

<p>
"Extropianism has no bearing on political philosophy. While many 
extropians are libertarian, the Extropian philosophy is fully compatible 
with communism, facism, and anarchy."

<p>
If Extropy really has no bearing</a> on politicla philosophy, then this 
sentence, which many including me would want to say is false, would stand 
as true. Is that the case?
