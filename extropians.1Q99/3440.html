I don't see why anyone would need a glossary to understand the Constitution;
it seems to have been written in simple terms that anyone could understand,
so that any jury could easily tell whether a law was unconstitutional and
acquit if it was. The problem is not the wording, it's that generations of
lawyers have convinced people that it's a much more complicated document than
it really is, and that phrases like 'shall not be infringed' don't really,
actually mean that.
