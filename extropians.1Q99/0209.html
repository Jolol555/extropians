Well, for now it's just a hack so I don't get overwhelmed by the complexity
of complexity.

<a href="0188.html#0209qlink3">&gt; Suppose you have a limited amount of mental resources to put into</a><br>
<i>&gt; learning and applying your knowledge. Should you specialize or</i><br>
<i>&gt; generalize? The answer depends on your environment and goals - on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; primordial African savannah being a generalist when it comes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; survival is essential, in a pampered western world you get richly</i><br>
<i>&gt; rewarded for specializing narrowly (at least I, as a graduate student,</i><br>
<i>&gt; gets rewarded for it). We might have biases left by evolution, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; has of course set some basic level of ability and interest suitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; for our evolutionary past.</i><br>

<p>
Of course, our ability to choose whether to specialise or generalise comes
from the fact that nature came up with an excellent general solution to the
problems of the savannah. Looking at my graph again I think it's important
to say that peak generalisation would correspond to low complexity and peak
specialisation would correspond to high complexity. This I think seems a
little counterintuitive due to the ambiguity of terms. The idea that complex
meta-systems can't form in high 'generality' or high 'speciality' is the
key. (I'm not sure if it was obvious that we couldn't be intelligent while
way up there on the 'generalisation' scale - the most general solution is no
solution at all.)

<a name="0212qlink1"><a href="0188.html#0209qlink4">&gt; &gt; I'd be interested to hear what you thought of Dyson's 'radiotelepathy'</a><br>

<a href="0188.html#0209qlink5">&gt; Yes, he has an interesting point and I think something like that may</a><br>

<i>&gt; Dyson is getting old - he never even mentioned nanotechnology, and seemed</i><br>
<i>&gt; somehow stuck in a Stapledon world. Very odd.</i><br>

Quote from "Freeman Dyson's Brain", Wired 6.02:

<p>
"Biotechnology has moved ahead so fast that it makes nanotechnology old hat.
If we get to the point of building micromachines, it will probably be done
by biotech."</a>
