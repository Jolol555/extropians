<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
This line of commentary seems very scientifically germane to the suggestion of
most or all ET's residing on heavier planets than the Earth. Robin Hanson's
paper on the Great Filter made it clear that one plausible reason for a
shortage of ET's would be if the typical development of life takes much
*longer* than here on Earth. Now, I've read articles that suggest that our own
sun will be too hot to support large animal life on our own planet at some
point within the next half billion years or so. In that context, it seems
we're already "near" the end of the 5 billion year "window" for our sort of
life to evolve. If intelligence usually takes a great deal longer than that to
get going, you either have to say that it's extremely rare, or look to stars
that are less massive and therefore longer lived than our sun, stars that are
stellar class "K" or even "M", rather than our sun's "G" class. Among main
sequence stars, the smaller and dimmer the star, the longer its life span, by
quite a large factor, I believe -- and I understand that the smaller stars are
more prone to dangerous stellar flares, too.

<p>
<a name="3072qlink1"> Given those general points, what I'm asking about the smaller stars</a> is, does
<a name="3072qlink2">the advantage of longer stellar life balance off against</a> the flare radiation
<a name="3072qlink3">danger in such a way as to strongly discourage life on any but the largest
terrestrial -type planets that may be orbiting those stars? This</a> is a highly
<a name="3072qlink4">technical question, no doubt! If someone is able to crunch the numbers, maybe
even complete with a good model of atmosphere thickness for different sized
planets, *that* would be interesting, certainly beyond anything that I'm
prepared to do. Admittedly, it's possible</a> that this "ET's favour large
planets" idea might be killed on some technicality in fairly<a name="3072qlink5"> short order, in
the sense of disproving it as a statistical trend. For instance, possibly
there just isn't all that much difference in radiation dangers for stellar
life spans of interest? I have some sense that the uncertainties about such
things as "frequency of stellar flaring" might enough to leave an idea like
</a>
this on the back burner for a long time, before<a name="3072qlink6"> enough is found out to either
</a>
disprove it, or to solidly encourage it?


<p>
<a href="3023.html#3034qlink2">&gt;Second, the argument takes a very short-term view of a problem that is</a><br>
<i>&gt;properly examined from a cosmological perspective.  It doesn't matter if</i><br>
<i>&gt;space travel takes a few hundred years longer, or is a few orders of</i><br>
<i>&gt;magnitude more expensive.  What we're looking for is something that makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;space travel utterly impossible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps this would be a good time to point out that the problem of escaping</i><br>
<i>&gt;from a deep gravity well (escape velocity maybe 15 MPS) is trivial compared</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the problem of interstellar colonization (required velocity at least 0.01</i><br>
<i>&gt;C = 1,860 MPS).  We can't rely on the first problem to prevent people from</i><br>
<i>&gt;solving the second one.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>


<p>
<a name="3072qlink7">In terms of making a suggestion about why ET's might not have gotten
off-planet, this seems not so much of a concern to me, since no one really
knows what it would take to discourage your typical ET civilization from
developing space settlements! If, as I've outlined, even the highest tech
rocketry could arguably be too expensive or too dangerous for an ET
civilization, who knows if they'd ever get around to building the really
large-scale launchers that they'd need to surpass those limits?</a> Note that
<a name="3072qlink8">sending cheap little "seed" AI's into space might not be the answer,</a> either;
<a name="3072qlink9">if small, cheap AI's tend to get fried by radiation, maybe our ET's always
have to give up on that as well.</a>

<p>
<a name="3072qlink10"><a name="3045qlink1"><a name="3042qlink1">What I really notice here is that the above comment from Billy Brown seems to
suggest that an obstacle of something being "a few orders of magnitude more
expensive" would necessarily be overcome eventually, maybe taking only a "few
hundred years" at most before the cost barrier</a> is reduced to something
<a name="3072qlink11">manageable. The trouble with cost barriers is that, if the cost of breaking
through the barrier is too high, maybe no one will do it! As the old saying
says, "you have to walk before you can run"; what</a> if most would-be space
travellers never learn to "walk"?</a></a>
