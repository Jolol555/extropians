<p>
  Observe this U.S. Air Force weather-warfare webpage: 

<p>
<a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/database/research/ay1996/acsc/96-025ag.htm">http://www.au.af.mil/au/database/research/ay1996/acsc/96-025ag.htm</a> 

<p>
  it says:

<pre>
     "In the US, weather modification will likely 
     become a part of national security policy with 
     both domestic and international applications."

</pre>
<p>
  That indicates that weather modifications classified 
  as "national security" (probably secret) operations 
  are planned to occur within the United States. If 
  witnesses across the US are seeing cloud-seeding
  operations conducted by Air Force jets, it seems
  that such secret Ops may be happening right now.

<p>
  This page gives a governmental definition of "security": 
  <a href="http://glossary.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-032/_4740.htm">http://glossary.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-032/_4740.htm</a> 

<p>
    "[2] With respect to classified matter, the condition
     that prevents unauthorized persons from 
    having access to official information that is 
    safeguarded in the interests of national security."

<p>
  So when the first military webpage says domestic
  weather-control Ops will be a subset of "national 
  security policy" it suggests they could be secret.

<p>
  If this nationwide military-cloud-seeding operation 
  has been happening for over a year, or even as far
  back as the late 1970's (as one witnesses told ENS),
  and the only way news of this surfaces to the people
  is either by direct witness, rumor, or out-of-the-way 
  and alternative-news sources, this suggests a uniform 
  news blackout is being conducted by the major media,
  and that media heads must be "authorized persons."
 
<p>
  This situation reminds me of the "Truth by Decree"
