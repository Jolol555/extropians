 I've noticed that since I registered with several well known REMOVE list sites,
and with an occasional threatening letter to ISPs that provide services to
spammers, the only spam I tend to receive now is usually mirrored by whoever is
targeting the extropians list, as I usually get a duplicate addressed to me as
well as one addressed to the list.

<a name="1552qlink1">I'm now billing ISPs that refuse to provide information on the spammers to me the
$500.00 fee that the CRA allows, since by concealing their identities, they are in
effect colluding and are acessories after the fact.</a> Juno is now up to around
$6500.00, yahoo is at $3500.00, usa.net is up to $2500.00. and others are at
lesser amounts. Another few months and I should have enough in accounts
receivables to get my lawyer salivating to take over the case I am putting
together... I wouldn't mind not making any money even if I won, just to get my
lawyer enthused and to cost the spammers as much as possible.

<p>
If anyone wants to get in on this, make a file in your email software to stick the
spam messages in, and forward them occasionally to: spamsuit@lorrey.com with full
header information.
