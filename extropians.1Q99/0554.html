  IAN: No, I don't admit that at all! What I 
  said was there's lower crime in rural areas 
  per se. I doubt that the reason is because 
  rural people kill more animals. I'd suspect 
  that it has to do with rural people being 
  self-sufficient by nature with solid family 
  support and folks aren't so crowded together.
  The close proximity of people in the cities
  maximizes opportunities for thugs</a> to attack
  and makes a life of crime more economical.

  as I recall, if they eat any flesh it's less
  than 10% of their diet (the great apes are
  strict vegetarians), and so the idea of a 
  human "hunting instinct" seems debatable.</a></a>
