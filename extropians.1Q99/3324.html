<p>
Sorry to upset you, Scott, I'll refer to them</a> as "the cryonically preserved"
<a name="3332qlink11">whenever I think of it. For instance: When the going gets tough,</a> the tough
<a name="3332qlink12">don't ask if the cryonically preserved should live.
This follows from the fact that no one knows if</a> the cryonically preserved
<a name="3332qlink13">_can_ live.

<p>
<a href="3302.html#3324qlink3">&gt;Actually, I started this thread by asking those on the list</a> to select the 5</a><br>
<a name="3332qlink14"><i>&gt;people that they most wished would enbrace the idea</a> of cryonics because the</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink15"><i>&gt;world could ill-afford to lose their particular gifts.  There</a> weren't very</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink16"><i>&gt;many responses to _that_ question.  The issue of whether</a> cryonic suspendees</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink17"><i>&gt;should be revived or not is one that you brought up, I believe.</i><br>

<p>
Right, and I had answered that, "I can think of half a dozen</a> people with a
talent or a gift that the world
<br>
<a name="3332qlink18">can ill afford to lose, but they don't embrace the idea of cryonics...
...IOW, the very people who have talents or gifts that the world</a> can ill
<a name="3332qlink19">afford to lose, do not endorse the idea of cryonics.
If those people don't endorse cryonics, why should extropians?"

<p>
So, now I ask you: Why don't people with a talent or a gift</a> that the world
<a name="3332qlink20">can ill afford to lose (candidates so far include Stephen Hawking,</a> Spider
<a name="3332qlink21">Robinson, Doug Engelbart, Robert M. Pirsig, Neal Stephenson, Douglass
Hofstadter, Martin Gardner, Arthur C. Clarke, Steven Jay Gould,</a> and James
<a name="3332qlink22">Randi) embrace the idea of cryonics? Has anyone asked _them_?

<p>
<a href="3302.html#3324qlink4">&gt;Well, for one thing, reviving a few geniuses and recruiting</a> their talents</a><br>
<a name="3332qlink23"><i>&gt;just may speed up the process of building a better human.  Besides,</a> as has</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink24"><i>&gt;been mentioned, the biotechnology that will lead</a> to reversible suspensions</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink25"><i>&gt;is going to progress anyway because there are a large number</a> of medical</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink26"><i>&gt;applications besides reviving cryonauts.</i><br>

<p>
Do any of those working on speeding up the process of building a better
human embrace the idea of cryonics? How come their names</a> haven't appeared?

<p>
<a name="3332qlink27"><a href="3302.html#3324qlink5">&gt;&gt;Neither you nor I, but rather posthumans shall decide</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;ultimately. Physically and finally, we will have to die as humans</a> in order</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink28"><i>&gt;&gt;to become posthumans. So, the only thing cryonics can contribute to</i><br>
extropy
<br>
<a href="3302.html#3324qlink6">&gt;&gt;relates to how it might help to develop transhumans, i.e., how it can</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;displace humans with posthumans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What are you saying here?  I must die in order to become a posthuman?</a>  The</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink29"><i>&gt;human race must die to make room for post humans?  That's news to me.</i><br>

<p>
IOW, you must die as a child to become an adult, because</a> the adult replaces
<a name="3332qlink30">the child. This leads to the acknowledgment that the adult</a> can understand
<a name="3332qlink31">the child, even though the child may not understand the adult.

<p>
Well, I guess you could say that it means "to make room</a> for post humans."
<a name="3332qlink32">Likewise, the catepillar must die to make room for the butterfly.</a> Nothing
<a name="3332qlink33">new there. Sorry you hadn't heard of it before. Biologists call it
"metamorphosis" I think. At least they used to. Perhaps not anymore.

<p>
<a href="3302.html#3324qlink7">&gt;I can understand how I might compare a "posthuman version of me vs.</a> the</a><br>
<a name="3332qlink34"><i>&gt;current version of me" to "the current version of me vs. a 1 year-old</i><br>
<i>&gt;version of me".  In a sense, the 1 year-old version had to "die"</a> to make</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink35"><i>&gt;room for the current version of me.  I realize that my developmental</i><br>
<i>&gt;transitions have been pretty smooth so far, and I agree that future</i><br>
<i>&gt;transitions may be much more quantum-like.  Any transition from</a> one state</i><br>
to
<br>
<a name="3332qlink36"><a href="3302.html#3324qlink8">&gt;another involves the "death" of the earlier state, but</a> is that the kind of</a><br>
<a name="3332qlink37"><i>&gt;death you're referring to?</i><br>

<p>
You got it.

<p>
<a href="3302.html#3324qlink9">&gt;Uh-oh.  The meme, "Death and birth eternally form the two sides</a> of life."</a><br>
<a name="3332qlink38"><i>&gt;is a particularly virulent one, and helps explain many of your views.</a>  Am I</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink39"><i>&gt;alone in considering this meme to be more Yin-Yang, dualistic,</i><br>
<i>&gt;polarized-thining nonsense?  I also don't believe</a> that cryonicists would</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink40"><i>&gt;advocate being frozen in a young and healthy state.  It's true that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;personally resent the fact that the state can prevent me</a> from arranging a</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink41"><i>&gt;cryonic suspension while I'm still alive, though.  I would want</a> the option</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink42"><i>&gt;of assisted suicide with immediate suspension if I discovered,</a> for example,</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink43"><i>&gt;that I had developed Alzheimer's or if I was terminally ill</a> and in a great</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink44"><i>&gt;amount of pain.  Why waste thousands and thousands of dollars</a> and medical</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink45"><i>&gt;resources on palliative care that is only briefly delaying</a> my deanimation</i><br>
<a name="3332qlink46"><i>&gt;when I plan on being suspended anyway?</i><br>

<p>
Good question. In addition, if birth and death do not form two sides of
life, what does? Would you make life one dimentional and linear?</a> It seems
<a name="3332qlink47">more sensible to me to take life as I find it, instead of trying</a> to make it
<a name="3332qlink48">fit some cryonic belief system. The cells in my body have all died</a> at least
<a name="3332qlink49">once during my lifetime, but the organism continues. Likewise,</a> all living
<a name="3332qlink50">humans may die during the course of the superorganism's lifetime.

<p>
<a href="3302.html#3324qlink10">&gt;Yes, grabbing the gusto is a good thing. I intend to grab</a> it for a long,</a><br>
<a name="3332qlink51"><i>&gt;long time in many different forms.</i><br>

<p>
I'll drink to that.

<p>
Cheers,
