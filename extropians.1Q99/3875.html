<i>&gt; it *is* about making money. It takes time, brains, and money </i><br>

<a name="3901qlink1">Well, it doesn't bother me.  Maybe we disagree less than I thought.  I
don't use the word Singularity, but my ultimate aim is probably similar
<a name="3901qlink2">to yours.</a>  Raising money isn't a problem for me at this stage of my
life; I am pursuing my own projects with my own money.  But I certainly
agree that action is essential, and action requires money.</a>  

<p>
<a name="3901qlink3">I wonder:  why do you think it is necessary to pursue your project under
the aegis of Extropianism?</a>  -- or Singularitarianism, which sounds even
more cultish?<a name="3901qlink4"> There is another meme that *is* about making money, and
that meme plays a more fundamental role in your life than Extropianism.</a> 
<a name="3901qlink5">Maybe a simple reframe is all you need.  Your project could be conceived
in a different context, described in different terms, and carried out
under a different aegis.<a name="3876qlink1">  As I said in one of my last posts before
dropping off the list two years ago, Extropianism is just a watered down
version of the ur-meme.  Why not go back to the real thing?  Your own
people will give you all the money you need, if you explain what you
want to do in terms that make sense to them.  That would be one way to
set events in motion.
