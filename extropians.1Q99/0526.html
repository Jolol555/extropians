Infant gets layer of bio-engineered skin

MIAMI (AP) -- Eight-week-old Tori
<br>
Cameron was born with a rare and deadly
<br>
skin disease that causes severe blistering with
the slightest touch. Patch by patch, she is
receiving a new set of "skin" that doctors
hope will prolong her life. 

<p>
"She won't be cured," her mother, Lorraine Cameron, said Monday. "But<br>
she could get better. It won't be an ongoing process where she will die from
it." 

<p>
Tori is believed to be the first newborn diagnosed with epidermolysis bullosa
to be given bio-engineered skin called Apligraf. So far, her tiny body is 40
percent covered with Apligraf, and it has blended so well doctors say they
can't tell the new skin from Tori's baby skin. 

<p>
"We hope this skin will take over and teach the baby's skin cells to behave<br>
normally," said Dr. William Eaglstein, chairman of dermatology for the
University of Miami School of Medicine. 

<p>
Skin created from foreskin cells

<p>
Tori is the first to be given the elastic material for something other than
healing wounds or for venous leg ulcers, said Dr. Lawrence Schachner,
professor of pediatrics and dermatology at the university. 

<p>
Doctors demonstrated the procedure Monday by applying a 7-centimeter
patch of Apligraf to the blistered right calf of Tori, who is  hospitalized
at Jackson Children's Hospital. 

<p>
Apligraf, developed by Massachusetts-based Organogenesis, was
 approved by the Food and Drug Administration in May. 

<p>
The skin is made from a baby's foreskin, removed at circumcision, and with
  bovine collagen. Doctors can grow 200,000 units of Apligraf from a
stamp-size piece of foreskin. 

<p>
"A single foreskin can give you football fields of skin," Schachner said. <br>

<p>
Baby's disease is painfully serious

<p>
Tori was born November 12 with Dowling Meara disease, a particularly
lethal form of epidermolysis bullosa which affects 100,000 Americans. 

<p>
Babies afflicted with the disorder are born lacking the necessary cells to hold
 their skin together and keep out bacteria and infections. The  slightest friction
can create painful blisters and lead to scarring, infections and raw spots
similar to second-degree burns. 

<p>
Tori's entire body is wrapped with gauze to minimize blistering and her hands
and feet are protected to keep her from hurting herself. 

<p>
Doctors have applied between 15 to 20 pieces of the laboratory-made skin
to Tori by simply placing it on her body and holding it in place with Vaseline
and gauze. Each segment comes from the same donor and costs $975 per
patch. 

<p>
"This is the best chance for this baby," Eaglstein said. <br>
