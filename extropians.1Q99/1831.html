<i>&gt; zero-sum game with an equilibrium of mixed strategies. But if Q makes</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum moves, then he can win against the classical Picard! There is</i><br>
<i>&gt; no equilibrium if both players play deterministic quantum strategies,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but Meyer shows that there is an equilibrium if both plays mixed</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum strategies (i.e. they select randomly between a number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; quantum strategies). A fun generalization, and it ties in with quantum</i><br>
<i>&gt; error correction (where nature is one of the players).</i><br>

<a href="http://math.ucsd.edu/~dmeyer/research/publications/qstrat/abs.html">http://math.ucsd.edu/~dmeyer/research/publications/qstrat/abs.html</a>. But
unfortunately it is not as interesting as it first seem to me. The
distinction between quantum and classical strategies is arbitrary (Picard
is restricted to a choice of two quantum operations that are called
classical even though there is really nothing classical about them,
whereas Q is allowed the whole range of possible pure quantum operations).

<p>
The PQ Penny Flip game is isomorphic to a game where two players
manipulate a point on a plane that starts at (0,1) without being able to
see where it is. Each round Q is allowed to rotate the point by an
arbitrary amount around the origin, but Picard is only allowed to reflect
the point about the line that passes through (0,0) and (1,1). This makes
it easy to see why Picard keeps losing. I think all quantum games where no
decoherence is possible until the end can similarly be analyzed as
equivalent classical games.

<p>
I am unable to think of real world applications of these ideas,
except perhaps in literal games. Quantum chess anyone?
