<a href="3254.html#3267qlink2">&gt; I do not believe that a particular position on abortion, for or against,</a><br>
<i>&gt; should be part of the Extropian political principles.  </i><br>

<p>
Being explicitly pro-choice (and for the legalization of drugs, prostitution,
euthanasia, abortion and other victimless crimes) sends the right
kind of (progressive, rational &amp; open-minded) message, and it's certainly
in the spirit of the Extropian principles. Examples like these make it easier
for people to understand the Extropian vibe, and show that the philosphy
is "socially aware". It might even make the more futuristic issues easier
to swallow.

Amen to that.

<p>
Yep, here's where even the most fanatical pro-choice people 
become incapable of rigorous rational thought, and get sentimental. 
IMO there should be (with regard to legal matters) some kind of
official value scale on which an individual is (roughly) measured, with 
babies and complete retards at the bottom, and the hyperintelligent/
sentient at the top. So basically your rights would grow as you'd 
develop mentally (which is more or less already the case with things 
like driver's licences, alcohol &amp; tobacco consumption, voting etc.) 
Because of the (slight) possibility of recovery, the "braindead" or 
otherwise comatose should retain their former status. 

<p>
Of course the system shouldn't be constructed so that the most 
"sentient" individuals would have a carte blanche for killing the lesser 
developed, but one should certainly eliminate such things as mothers 
going to jail for killing their newborn infant, let alone for having an abortion.
