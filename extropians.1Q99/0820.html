Yes, my cats are fixed. You cannot get a cat from the Humane Society
that has not been fixed. (This is done using an anesthetic, so the cat
does not suffer.) Yes, I suppose an animal "rights" person could argue
that you are denying cats the experience of sexual pleasure. However,
the consequences of not sterilizing some cats and letting them all "do
their thing" would be millions more strays running around leading
miserable lives, getting diseases, starving to death and being squashed
by cars. Just taking a purely utilitarian approach towards animal
welfare (forget "rights") argues strongly in favor of sterilization.
Also, I doubt very much whether sterilized cats really are in terrible
psychic agony over their condition, unlike humans.

<p>
I really have not come across a good argument for twisting cats necks
and throwing them against a wall. The question is whether this ought to
be legally prohibited or not.
