Wonder why that is? (smirk).

If I were an Indian engineer looking to make it big I'd research US patents
and use them to develop my own products in India, rather than coming to the
US to compete under the IP 'restrictions' as you allege. Apparently your
position isn't so. They come here because of the freedom of opportunity that
