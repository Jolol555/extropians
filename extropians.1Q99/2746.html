I was born in 1973, so had no chance of going to Southeast Asia. However,
I *still* think that it was a bad idea (not to mention wrong) for the US
Govt to send people over there to carry on a calculated program of just
too little force to acheive their stated goals.  Whether it would have been
correct to send people to *actually* acheive those goals is another
question, and I am not sure.
