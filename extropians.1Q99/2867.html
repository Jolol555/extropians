Yeah, that's the one.  Got the name mixed up w/ Twilight 2000, another game
of theirs.  Both very good.

<a name="2917qlink1">My understanding is that Zeta2 has a close, dim M companion.  I think the
most recent version of Gliese's Near Star Catalog mentions this as a note.</a>
<a name="2917qlink2">I was deep into this stuff a while back; I compiled my own excessively
detailed version of the Gliese near star catalog with XYZ coordinates and
distances to all known stars w/in 50 ly.  Was working on merging this with
the much larger PARALLAX catalog, but never got around to finishing it.  I
also have very detailed info on nearby binary systems and so forth if you're
interested.</a>

<a name="2917qlink3">My 2300/Cyberpunk campaign revolved around a quasi-statist organization
called the Interstellar Trade Authority, a sort of super-GATT created by
Terran megacorps to manage the world economy.  (The ITA was actually based
loosely on the Terran Trade Authority described in a fantastic series of
books by Stewart Cowley; see
<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/~banksp/Rec/TTABooks/TTABooks.html">http://www.geocities.com/~banksp/Rec/TTABooks/TTABooks.html</a>)  The characters
started off as agents of the ITA, but after spending too much time in the
perimeter colonies came to see the ITA's darker side and rejected the
organization (and not without a fight).

<a name="2917qlink4">I kinda cheated with regards to FTL.  Borrowing an idea from Sagan's
*Contact*, I postulated that an alien race had long ago constructed a
transportation network to connect interesting parts of the galaxy.  The
closest gateway to Earth was the so-called "Nemesis" that supposedly orbits
the sun outside the Oort cloud, periodically kicking comets our way.   FTL
travel was really cool.  From the outside, Nemesis appeared as a dull black
globe 1 km in diameter.  Though it looked solid, a ship could pass across
its surface.  From the inside, the system had a bizarre, hypertoroid
topology and allowed travel both through space-time and to alternate
universes.  (That was a big part of the game; the characters eventually had
to comprehend that they could never be sure which was "their" universe, and
that the concept was really meaningless anyway.)
