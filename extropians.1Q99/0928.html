Such an absence of (inter)action would generally be considered morally deficient rather than neutral.</a><br>

I'm thinking non-interaction in a more physical sense. A swimmer sitting
on the shore, watching a drowing child, has knowledge of that drowning
child. I'm making the implicit assumption here that knowledge can only
come from interaction, and that if there is knowledge then there
necessarily has been some causal chain linking the two agents.

<p>
By non-interaction, I mean agents between which there is no
communication, and no causal chain whatsoever.

<p>
I didn't say it was a very USEFUL zero point, just one natural one. :)
