<p>
  IAN: A stone is an object, and as I understand, 
  it's composed of "a collection of objects" known
  as molecules, atoms, and subatomic entities; which
  directly falsifies your claim that "a collection 
  of objects can't itself be a physical object."


<p>
<a href="1003.html#1009qlink2">&gt;But I suspect we're once again embroiled in more a semantic than a</a><br>

<i>&gt;arrangements of things on the other, and grave errors ensue from failing to</i><br>
<i>&gt;distinguish different categories.</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: Your error of saying physical objects 
  (which are collections of entities) cannot 
  exist seems the gravest and only error here.


<p>
<a href="1003.html#1009qlink3">&gt;Smith's famous invisible hand - virtually synonymous with the extropian</a><br>
<i>&gt;principle of spontaneous organisation - is the internal organizing</i><br>
<i>&gt;principle of a complex relational nexus. </i><br>

<p>
  IAN: And the "complex relational nexus"
  is the "collective entity." I think that 
  the case to the contrary is just semantics.
