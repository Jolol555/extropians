(as the saying goes, tho' I hope I'm not fascistic about it) almost all
that time.  I think it unlikely that domesticated animals will become
extinct once we stop consuming them as food, and focus instead on the hope
that the institutional practices by means of which they are transformed
from animals into "meat" will become extinct instead.  These practices and
institutions don't comport well with the self-image of enlightened humane
societies, as I understand them.  Certainly, they don't seem to be
"lifestyle" issues, in any of the usual understandings of that phrase.  As
far as human analogies go, the one that seems more relevant here is the
one in which antiabortionists argue that no-one who was not aborted
themselves can properly argue for the practice, since they would not be in
a position to make the argument had they been aborted themselves. 
Surely a foetus has no more of a stake in a life it has not yet lead,
than a cow a stake (or "steak"?) in a life she would have lead had the
vegetarians not managed to incubate a culture in which meat-eating is no
longer a widespread practice.
