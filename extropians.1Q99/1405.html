 Levi Strauss Quit Cancer-Case Site
<p>
     SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Levi Strauss &amp; Co. abandoned a building at
 its headquarters after seven women working there developed breast
 cancer, a company spokesman confirmed Thursday night.
<p>
     The jeans company began an initial inquiry in January 1997 after
 several women were diagnosed with breast cancer while working at
 the four-story Saddleman building at Levi's Plaza, Levi spokesman
 Clarence Grebey said.
<p>
     The investigation later expanded to include cancer researchers
 and Patricia Buffler, former dean of the University of California,
 Berkeley's School of Public Health.
<p>
     No link was found between the cancer and the building, but with
 employees concerned and the company restructuring, Levi relocated
 200 employees from the building last October. The remaining
 furniture was removed from the building last week.
<p>
     ``All of the reports to date have shown that there is absolutely
 no evidence to suggest any link between these illnesses and the
 workplace,'' according to an e-mail message sent to employees and
 obtained by the San Francisco Business Times in a story published
 Friday.
<p>
     ``Despite this, we fully understand the unacceptable level of
 anxiety that this ongoing issue has caused,'' the memo continued.
 ``Consequently, we have decided to relocate employees in the
 building as soon as possible.''
<p>
     The women all worked in desk jobs and did not work with
 hazardous chemicals or special machinery, Grebey told The
 Associated Press.
<p>
     ``While it is alarming that a number of women developed breast
 cancer, the cancer researchers said that random occurrences like
 this happen throughout the general population inexplicably in
 various surroundings,'' Grebey said.
<p>
     Despite assurances by the company that the building was safe,
 employees wanted to be moved.
<p>
     ``The feeling among employees was that there was a hex on the
 building,'' said Diane Dito, a former process leader in Levi's
 Prevention Health and Safety Team. ``Some people felt very strongly
 that it was the building, and the only way to satisfy them was to
 get them out of there.''
<p>
     The building is owned by San Francisco-based Blue Jeans Equities
 West, a development firm that conducted its own independent
 research and concluded there was no building-related cause to the
 breast cancer cases. At least two companies have considered moving
 into the building, the weekly newspaper reported.
<p>
     No lawsuits have been filed.
