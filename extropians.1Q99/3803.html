     Nanosystems is the "technical" text book of nanotechnology.(my 
favorite book)
<p>
     The problem with nanotech and academic angle, is there is no nano 
major at this time. So Drexler had a struggle in this area, and indeed 
had to create one. This was a problem in our well defined fields of 
study. Because nanotech covers such a wide span of discipline's, this 
will be an issue we will have to further deal with.

<a href="3801.html#3803qlink1">&gt;&gt;Drexler's problem is that he did it backwards.  He wrote the popular </a><br>
book
<br>
<a href="3801.html#3803qlink2">&gt;first, and then when he got ignored/flamed by academia, he went back</a><br>
<i>&gt;and got his PhD and then wrote the technical book.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And the technical book is itself an affront to the academic tradition,</i><br>
<i>&gt;aggressively interdisciplinary to the point that no specialist is able </i><br>
to
<br>
<a href="3801.html#3803qlink3">&gt;understand it.  It was like a slap in the face to his academic critics.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;He will continue to be a pariah unless he decides to play the game of</i><br>
<i>&gt;academic politics.</i><br>
