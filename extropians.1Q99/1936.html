If you note that there was an explosion part way down for the rear section.
This tells me that the plane exceeded its speed design specs for the wings and
they tore off, igniting the fuel in the wing tanks...this would agree with a
trajectory pushing 700 mph at terminus. I assume you are referring to the 82
mph initial speed as the stall speed of the 747. With its nose torn off, its
stall speed should be a bit higher. Keep in mind that sea level speed of sound
is 630 mph or so, as I recall... Given an initial forward velocity of the nose
section of any where from 200-400+ knots, at least a portion of this should be
translated by planing effects into downward velocity. A 29 second time to
impact is completely reasonable for the nose section. I agree that it could be
specious for the upwardly climbing rear section, depending on how long the
engines continued to produce thrust...

<p>
A jet engine is self powered, self pumped. There should have been plenty of
fuel in the lines between the emergency shutoff valve (if it activated), as
well as in the sump well for the injection manifold, and those bad boys take
at least 30 seconds to rev down. They could easily have kept producing thrust
for at least 10-20 seconds after the time of the initial separation. If the
initial explosion welded the wire harnesses (they travel right by the fuel
tank), then the engines should have kept seeing a closed control circuit and
kept running...Most of the power distribution and control equipment is in the
area around the wing root, so the 747 could have kept running like a chicken
with its head cut off, for at least a little bit.

<p>
This is the reason why ejection systems like the F-111 capsule have little
guillotine solenoids to sever the controls harnesses, rather than explosive
charges like the mechanicals have. They don't want any circuitry welding
closed and presenting a normally closed circuit to the plane.
