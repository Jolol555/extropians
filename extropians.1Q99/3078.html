<a href="3077.html#3078qlink1">&gt;  Someone asked about extropian relevance. I feel it has to do with</a><br>

<p>
I was in the AF for almost nine years...one of those years was in South East
Asia.  I enlisted mostly because I had no choice.  I don't think that boys of
my age back then had much idea of what was right or wrong in this sense.  I've
always felt that there was some basic inconsistency in having a draft in a
"free" society.  I thought slavery was taboo.

<p>
I've since decided that slavery in NOT taboo.  The civil war didn't free the
slaves...it merely changed ownership.  Still...a free society is a nice
idea....It'd be nice to see one someday.
