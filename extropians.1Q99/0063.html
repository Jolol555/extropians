Just so.  The first century (and millennium) started on Jan 1, AD1 (because
<a name="0064qlink1">the ninny who did the calculations for the Pope around the middle of the
sixth century forgot about year zero.</a>  Incidentally, it's generally
accepted, I think, that Christ was born in 5 BC).  Add a century to 1, get
AD101.  Add a thousand, get AD1001.  Add two thousand, get Jan 1, AD2001.
*It can't possibly be anything else*, even if heavyweights like Stephen Jay
Gould get all populist and damp-eyed and go for the ignorant 2000.

The following gambit doesn't offer a very good rate of return (but then you
don't risk your investment), although you might get beaten up.  Go into a
bar, find all the bunnies who insist noisily that the next millennium
starts Jan 1, 2000.  Offer them a dollar for each year that has passed
since the start of the first Christian millennium until the date they say
it ends, in exchange for $2000.  Collect $1 from each of them and run away.
