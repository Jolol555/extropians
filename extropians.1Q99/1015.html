<a name="1020qlink1">My mother was a Jehova Witness. That is, until she died last March,
because she refused a transfusion. The doctors unamamously agreed 4
units of blood would have saved her. Her "brothers" and "sisters" hung
around the hospital like a pack of vultures, making sure she wouldn't
get blood. It was her wish, and we wouldn't violate it, but her
mysticism finally killed her after suffering for 3 weeks in ICU.
