You seem to assume a population primarily composed of freedom-loving
individualists who are ready and willing to die to prevent any infringement
of their rights.  The only way you are ever going to get that is if you and
a few hundred of your friends move to Luna and found a new society.

<p>
In the real world, most people are afraid of large groups of armed men.  A
PPA with a million customers might have tens of thousands who would fight in
self defense, but only one or two would be willing to pull the lone gunman
routine.

<p>
If a PPA doesn't allow itself to be sued, most people won't even notice
unless it takes blatant advantage of its immunity.  If it becomes common
practice for PPAs to give themselves that kind of loophole, most people will
just decide they have to live with it.  A PPA can get away with all sorts of
slimy double-dealing this way, as long as the public relations fallout isn't
too bad.

<p>
You're assuming the PPAs are stupid.  It seems more realistic to assume they
are run by intelligent people who want to maximize their bottom line.

<p>
Let's say mega-PPA A and mega-PPA B together have a majority share of the
market in my town, and they decide to engage in a bit of price-fixing.  The
first thing they do is start squeezing the little companies.  Since a small
competitor can't operate effectively unless it has a mutual-enforcement
agreement with the big guys, all they have to do is play hardball on the
contract terms.  PPAs A &amp; B insist on very favorable terms for their
clients, charge the smaller companies large 'processing fees', and so on.
Over the course of a few years it should be pretty easy to squeeze out the
minor players.

<p>
Then they raise their prices, start levying opt-out fees, and generally act
like monopolists.  As long as the extra charges amount to less than the cost
of moving to another city, very few people will actually leave.  Any new
competitor that attempts to enter the market can be dealt with the same way.

<p>
This process is pretty simple, so we should expect it to be a common
scenario.  That, of course, only strengthens the hand of the PPAs.  The more
common monopolistic pricing becomes, the harder it is for people to move
elsewhere to escape it.  This also leads to a market dominated by a few big
companies, which means that it is easier to arrange large-scale collusion.

<p>
Now, I'm sure you'll point out that people can simple opt not to pay anyone
for police protection.  But if they do, that means that they have no
recourse if someone does commit a crime against them.  In particular, it
means that they have no one to turn to if the local PPA sends a squad of
goons over to 'convince' them to renew their contract.
