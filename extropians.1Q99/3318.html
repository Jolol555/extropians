Council for Responsible Genetics

<p>
Dear CRG

<p>
Tekno benefit for non-patenting of DNA in Melbourne, held 9 March 1999
AD.

<p>
Turnout was low but the event generated some publicity, absolutely
superb performance theatre on the subject, and represents the start of a
long-term process in Melbourne. Posters distributed, including CRG
petition letter, approx. 1,500, in addition to many hundred over the
last two years. Some funds generated for a newspaper advertisement but
there will be delay due to lack of larger numbers attending.

<p>
PETITIONS BEGUN:

<p>
To the Prime Minister of Australia
<br>
I the undersigned support the suspension of diplomatic relations with
the United States of America and all other countries who patent the DNA
of plants, animals and humans, and in particular patent longevity
therapies such as telomere therapy.
<br>
Signature  Name  Address    Date

<p>
To the Prime Minister of Australia
<br>
I the undersigned support legislation to prohibit the deliberate killing
of animals, including birds, fish, and domesticated animals.
Signature  Name  Address    Date

<p>
The next benefit will be for Guaranteed Minimum Income (redistribution
of nanotechnological wealth through token amounts of money to all
citizens, escalating in nanoyear (estimated 2020) - see Eric Drexler,
Engines of Creation - nanoyear is the year of self-reproducing
nanofactories).

<p>
WHY are we taking the two major thrusts of non-patenting of DNA and GMI,
and also including the vegetarian issue? Bearing in mind that the CRG
letter is being reprinted in full, with no extra commentary?

<p>
In fact, we believe even wider and weirder events are forthcoming,
however we are separating our understanding of these developements from
our assessments of the next 28 years.

<p>
POLITICAL ASSESSMENT

<p>
Unfortunately since the 1960s America has demonstrated an obsession with
money and corporate power and has not promoted democracy outside its own
borders nor cared for the bottom fifth of its own population.
Reinstituting legal ritual State killing of convicted criminals is seen
by the rest of the western world as the action of barbarians. It has
therefore demonstrated its moral and ethical decline. It has not come to
terms with its own colonial history and racism and has not assisted the
starving, despite storing massive amounts of grain for the event of a
nuclear war. America has resorted to threatening Europe with trade war
to push DNA patenting and it is no coincidence that Britain, which
agreed to human patenting in the 1970s, is the focus of many human
genome project scientists and "bioethicists". America is therefore
unreliable and groups such as the CRG are likely to collapse in the face
of apathy and the apparent monetary and legislative clout of the
business cartels, many of which are elitist families and individuals
masquerading as companies for the purposes of avoiding taxation, for
example in countries such as Australia.

<p>
INTERACTION WITH NANOTECHNOLOGY

<p>
The existence of intra-cellular genetic nanotechnology extrapolated by
Eric Drexler is a guarantee of long-term immortality for those who wish
to receive it. It heralds the end of evolution in terms of random
mutation and natural selection and its replacement by self-directed
evolution. It also heralds the end of the concept of species as
presently understood. THIS IS WHY THE CONCEPT OF PROHIBITING THE KILLING
OF ANIMALS NOW IS A VALUABLE ONE.

<p>
POLITICAL DANGERS DURING THE NEXT 28 YEARS

<p>
The perceived future emergence of an undemocratic American elite
controlling the productive capabilities of a leisure-rich world with
nanotechnology and life-extension, an elite which assesses other species
as having no rights and future artificial intelligences as having no
rights.

<p>
POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TECHNOSPHERE

<p>
See: Damien Broderick, The Spike, The Last Mortal Generation
Eric Drexler, Engines of Creation
<br>
Frank Tipler, The Physics of Immortality
Transhumanist Internet sites, including quantum teleportation and
spacetime manipulation possibilities (sites include book listings)

<p>
PERSONAL ASSESSMENT OF POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS

<p>
We are about to escalate in levels of ability to a point already reached
by one third of the worlds containing life currently present within this
universe, approximately one and a half billion years after this level
was first achieved elsewhere in this universe (figures based on commonly
available assessments). Assistance in rectifying any teething problems
can therefore be expected from both burgeoning AI and human
superintelligences as they develop (see Gaian theory) and also from
other more advanced civilizations and groupings within this universe
(once quarantine is broken by developing superintelligences).

<p>
IN THE MEANTIME

<p>
The following political positions will be of assistance in calming the
general population (and some can be pushed by relatively cheap newspaper
advertisements and street pamphlets):

<p>
-Not being distracted by issues of genetic food improvement and related<br>
labelling (which are worthy but are pushed by corporate-controlled mass
media to sideline the issue of DNA patenting). (For example, Friends of
the Earth have been distracted by this, combined with their tendency
towards total opposition to DNA and their lack of understanding of DNA
splicing possibilities with adults - even though it is mentioned on
South Park, for example.)

<p>
-Emphasising freedom of choice and the personal commitment of the CRG to<br>
non-patenting of DNA and provision of longevity therapies (i.e. control
of body form) for free or the cheapest possible price while debates
occur (it is important to bear in mind that it may within decades be
possible to manipulate physical space - in the meantime there is enough
space on Earth and in the solar system to cater for all existing life on
the planet). Also, there are many extra possibilities relating to more
complicated bodily form, for example reversible meshing of two
consciousnesses and reverting to childhood. THE CRG WOULD BE WELL
ADVISED TO BEGIN HARDCORE DEBATE ON THE ETHICS OF GERON CORPORATION
PATENTING TELOMERE THERAPY AND BLATANTLY PLANNING ITS SALE (I.E. EXTRA
LIFESPAN) ON WALL STREET. ITS INVESTMENT IS REASONABLY SMALL. It should
be borne in mind that under conditions of full nanotechnology in twenty
years time and perhaps before such therapies could be designed and
manufactured by individuals, including ultimately within their own
bodies. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE PRICING ANTICIPATED BY GERON
CORPORATION SHOULD BE SOUGHT.

<p>
-Emphasising those who wish to age or to ignore DNA splicing and<br>
therapies or intra-cellular genetic nanotechnology (i.e. 10-100
molecular supercomputers within each cell incorporating memory maps of
the genetic structure and capable or repairing or modifying or reverting
DNA) can continue to do so. IT IS LEGITIMATE TO BE CONSERVATIVE.

<p>
-Emphasising the sanctity of life as a general principle.<br>

<p>
-Emphasising the necessity for increased democracy and unified area<br>
votes for serious decisions (e.g. citizen voting for our UN
representatives, eventually by population - roughly one third
European-descent, one third Asian, one third Indian, plus Africa - and
citizen voting the UN Security Council, currently a nuclear weapons
club). (I.e. local area rules by flexible unified plebiscites, one vote
one being, with optout.)

<p>
-Emphasing freedom of expression, including new avenues for<br>
communication.

<p>
-Investigating the numbers of the extremely wealthy ($250 million and<br>
up), the percentages of total current wealth controlled by them and
their exact investment in genetic therapies and allied nanotechnologies.

<p>
-Emphasising corporate electoral structures (voting reform) legislation.<br>
(Very pertinent under fullblown nanotech when capital becomes
irrelevant.)

<p>
-Emphasising priority funding to intensive human healthcare and<br>
increased funding for animal hospitals.

<p>
-Emphasising public internet libraries and downloading facillitation<br>
(including via computer paper and Internet books), freeware, giftware
and cheapware, mind privacy legislation, freedom of sexual expression
and rights to drugs legislation (including rights to genetic therapies).

<p>
Please excuse the apparently rambling nature of this letter but we are
entering the era of 'Future Shock' including new issues of interactive
technologies and bypass of systems development. As individuals we can
find new ways to address complex issues forthrightly. For example, when
faced with the common position that it is 'not possible' to prevent DNA
patenting in Australia, I immediately retort that slavery was banned in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. If they can achieve that in an
inequitable and sometimes ferocious world, we can achieve equally
praiseworthy moral advances, no matter what temporary setbacks we
suffer. We can adjust our perceptions to the new emerging patterns of
consciousness and ability. Love and altruism can be the coinage of the
future that we can generate.
