   cracker
<pre>
      A cracker is an individual who attempts to access computer systems
      without authorization.  These individuals are often malicious, as
      opposed to hackers, and have many means at their disposal for
      breaking into a system.  See also: hacker, Computer Emergency
      Response Team, Trojan Horse, virus, worm.

      A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the
      internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in
      particular.  The term is often misused in a pejorative context,
      where "cracker" would be the correct term.  See also: cracker.

 Hacking and Cracking

<p>
   Hacking is skillful programming.  Cracking is breaking and entering.
   If you don't know the difference, read the first two books below.  If
   you don't think it matters, read the last book below, which examines
   how law enforcement agencies confused about computers and networks
   did some very strange things.

[Funny hacker story] :-)

Back to the story about the crackers supposed to have "stolen" a satellite:

<p>
The simplest way to do it would have been cracking the system software
on the satellite controlling system, command the satellite to move so
so you no longer can reach the dish from Earthside.  The satellite would
effectively go offline.
