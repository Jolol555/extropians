Yes, but what if its foggy?  Those of you who are computer fans,
consider the calculation that has to take place in order for a THAAD
missile to find its mark: the target must be tracked by radar, mapped in
4 space (to predict its trajectory), the THAAD missile must then be
fired, then bleed off some of its energy (usually, since it is launched
by a solid rocket motor which must burn up completely before the
end game guidance can be deployed) in a spirally maneuver, then
the onboard seeker must engage, while constantly recalculating the
target trajectory, integrating the information from gyros fore and aft,
and the cruciform nozzles in the kill vehicle must work perfectly enough
to hit body to body, since THAAD carries no explosive charge.

If this firing next Wednesday hits, I will be in awe of my own company.
