Speaking of Roger Penrose...

<p>
I'm guessing that a large number of people here have read Hans Moravec's new
book, Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind, which features a small comic
strip featuring a certain Roger. I've never read any of Penrose's books so I
don't know if he makes similar comments about Moravec, but I do know he's
working on a new book and I had an idea for a comic strip for him to include
in it. It's extremely unsubtle (featuring Moravec's consciousness residing
in the thermal vibrations of a baboon’s arse) and I doubt Penrose would
approve. But if anyone can get me in contact with him I'd be grateful.
