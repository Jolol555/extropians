That is simply amazing...

<p>
<a href="1236.html#1243qlink1">&gt;What is the long term effect if any of rubbing cleansers (soap) on your</a><br>
<i>&gt;skin. Is there subtle penetration past the skin barrier? If so, does </i><br>
the
<br>
<a href="1236.html#1243qlink2">&gt;body react defensively? Does the continual, daily reduction of oils and</a><br>
<i>&gt;changing of Ph levels cause the body to go on a long term homeostatis</i><br>
<i>&gt;maintaining sojourn that over time causes difficult to identify </i><br>
systemic, ie
<br>
<i>&gt;autoimmune effects? </i><br>

<p>
<a name="1374qlink1">Well, haven't you ever thought that your organism is a wisely 
'constructed' structure which can adjust to many things,</a> and that those 
<a name="1374qlink2">cleansers are no more harmful to your skin than the air</a> that you breath 
<a name="1374qlink3">in every second? (especially, since you live in an urban area,</a> 
presumably)
<br>
<a name="1252qlink1">Honestly, I am inclined to think that if you would put an organism into 
an absolutely sterile (which is impossible) area, this poor organism 
would have died.</a> In order to maintain the immune system of any organism 
<a name="1252qlink2">in order, this organism needs to be exposed to some kind of attack... 
let it be soap...ha-ha
</a>

<p>
<a href="1236.html#1243qlink3">&gt;I think cran is an example of the above. By practicing CRAN, I have</a><br>
<i>&gt;eliminated many ills and pains of my body due to purely Biomechanical</i><br>
<i>&gt;improvements...ie my upper - inner thighs no longer rub together </i><br>
whenever I
<br>
<a href="1236.html#1243qlink4">&gt;walk...thus, my stride is straighter, thus, I am not over-rotating my </a><br>
lower
<br>
<a href="1236.html#1243qlink5">&gt;joints extremities, and am not overpronating my feet to counteract the </a><br>
shock
<br>
<a href="1236.html#1243qlink6">&gt;of extra weight. Thus I have less pain, feel better, and love life </a><br>
more.

<p>
Congratulations! Now, what do you want?

Apart from the ascetic ideal, man, the animal-man, would have had no 
significance
