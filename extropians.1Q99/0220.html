Yes, by all means, let's apply this political litmus test and reject
everything said by socialists.  We can start with people like Robert
Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein.  Everybody knows that they're a bunch
of no-nothing looters, not to be trusted, right?

</a>
<p>
Albert Einstein, the looter.

<p>
Imagine Albert Einstein breaking a store window and grabbing the
merchandise, running away with a boom box on his shoulder, his wispy
white hair flying in all directions as the German physicist anxiously
looks back over his shoulder for pursuing cops.

<p>
That's the kind of morals and ethics he had, right, Terry?

<a name="0224qlink2">In my experience, many if not most pure scientists and mathemeticians
lean towards socialism.</a>  In fact, I once read a eulogy in a mathematics
magazine where the author went to some lengths to apologize for the fact
that the deceased was *not* a socialist.  He had to explain that there
were personal reasons why the man hadn't become a socialist, that he was
still a good person, etc.  Apparently it was quite an embarrassment not
to be a socialist in those circles.

<a name="0258qlink1"><a name="0257qlink1">"I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils,
namely through the establishment of a socialist economy,</a> accompanied by
<a name="0257qlink2">an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals."
