<a href="3760.html#3771qlink1">&gt; Of course, that's one's immediate response.  But what distinguished N rays</a><br>

<i>&gt; replicated.  If this new effect *works* - ya gotta love that modem whistle</i><br>

<p>
The problem isn't just that this would be a completely new model for
how molecules interact, but that it seems to invalidate existing models.
The notion that molecules interact through physical contact has been the
basis for all of chemistry as well as biology.  If nonlocal interactions
are possible why haven't we seen them in chemistry?  You wouldn't need an
expensive catalyst, you could just shake it in water as you dilute it to
the vanishing point.  I find it hard to believe that such an important
effect would have been overlooked by practical, profit driven chemical
engineers for over 100 years.

<p>
And then there is all the successful work with current models in biology,
like drug design based on the lock and key concept.  Why should it be that
we find that effective drugs and hormones do in fact fit their receptor
molecules using a physical connection model?  A remote resonance concept
doesn't explain that very well.

<p>
It would be one thing if the guy proposing this had some credibility,
but he's apparently been guilty of claiming remarkable effects which
he wasn't able to reproduce in front of skeptics.  That's a pretty weak
basis for paying attention when he claims that everything we know is
wrong.
