Numerous sites do this, and it's annoying as hell because they bounce a huge
number of perfectly legitimate messages... while letting most spam straight
through. Many virtual domains (e.g. unicorn.com) fail their overzealous
tests, and there are various people out there who can't subscribe to the
mailing lists I run because their ISPs bounce my mail.

<p>
But even if it could work, there are numerous problems:

  <li>  It might be spam anyway, why do you think that making spammers put a

</OL>
<p>
Number 4 is possible the worst problem. Most of the patches just check 
that the email address is a valid one; so it just encourages spammers to 
send out email with fake headers containing real addresses that they've 
found on Usenet and the Web rather than totally false headers. 

<p>
In summary, address verification of this kind is pointless, counterproductive
and will never stop spam; I really wish people would stop pushing for it.
Digital signature verification at the individual user level for people you 
regularly communicate with is certainly a good idea... system-level blocking
of people you might want to hear from is not.
