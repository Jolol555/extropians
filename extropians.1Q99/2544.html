I haven't made much of a splash around here, but I thought that some
people might be interested in the opinion of Mormon Transhumanist.  This
did come up in the discussion.

<p>
Here is the teaching.  "As man is, god once was.  As god is, man may
become."  The mormon god is not a traditional god at all, but rather an
ultimately advanced human being.  That is, god is a successful
extropian; omniscient, immortal, human, space traveller.  The teaching
goes on that god (and goddess) is also our humane "exemplar", so we
should also become more advanced ourselves.  For me, this is a very
inspiring approach to transhumanism.  It is actually redundant to say
Mormon Transhumanist, although I can definitely see that it is not for
everyone.  

<p>
That's it, for what it's worth.  If this is off topic, I'm sorry.  If
your an atheist, that's your business.  I'm not judging, just informing.
 In fact, I consider myself and atheist as well.  Please email me
privately, if you don't grok that.
