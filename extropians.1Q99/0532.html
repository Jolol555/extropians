That loud bang was my hype meter bouncing off the ceiling.  Hang on a sec
while I turn down the gain...

<p>
People have been running custom distributed programs across the Internet for
a few years now.  This looks like a standardized way of doing the same
thing.  It could be useful for solving some types of problem, but it isn't
going to change the carrying capacity of the network.

<p>
Cute trick - but that means you need to buy their GPS receiver to use the
system.  That's going to slow down adoption markedly, even if the system
works.

<p>
But only if the program is solving lots and lots of small, relatively
independent problems.  If you need one big calculation done, it isn't going
to help much.

<p>
Yeah, right.  The latency of the Internet is too high.  You'd get a neural
net where signals take hundreds of milliseconds to move from one node to
another.  The increase in computing power would be largely cancelled out by
the drop in signaling speed.

<p>
The full article makes some highly unlikely claims about magical increases
in bandwidth and layering multiple networks on the same infrastructure.  I
think someone goofed an interview and got their information scrambled.
