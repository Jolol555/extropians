<a name="2249qlink1">Guys, it is still me, spike.  I am going to try to use upper case
letters
<br>
for a while.  I gave it up for a year, because I was having trouble with
carpal tunnel and I thought it might get better if I did not reach for
</a>
the
<br>
shift key.  It didnt.  {8-[

<p>
<a href="2050.html#2209qlink1">&gt; I don't think your statement that there is never any oxygen in a tank is true. The</a><br>
<i>&gt; reason why tanks don't blow up so often is that the pumps and sensors are built so</i><br>
<i>&gt; well that they almost never expose bare conductors to the inside of the tank....</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2216qlink1">Mike, this troubles me.  With hydrocarbon fuels, it requires a lot more
air than fuel to make an ignition.  Too rich and it wont even burn,
never
<br>
mind explode.  Having a fuel tank leak would cause some air to be vented
in, I just dont see how you could get the magic 15 to 1 air to fuel
ratio
<br>
inside a fuel tank.</a>

<p>
<a name="2216qlink2"><a href="2050.html#2209qlink2">&gt; ...happened to the plane, but there is so much of the plane (especially in the area of</a><br>
<i>&gt; that fuel tank) that is still missing, that I am afraid we will never know.</i><br>

<p>
Perhaps.  This whole thread started with the contention (I think) that
the CIA report was trying to cover something by claiming a 29
second plunge of the crippled plane into the sea.  I realized that
the number 29 in itself is an indication they hoped to minimize the
time, just as Frys electronics puts a new electronic gazazzafratz on
sale for 29.99 because that sounds less than 30 bucks.  29 seconds,
well, thats less than half a minute.  I imagine it really took about a
full terrifying minute for the doomed, and likely conscious, passengers
to end their suffering.  I would still like to pretend it was only 29
seconds
<br>
even if I know better.  Either way, I suspect a fuel leak started a fire
outside the tank which then (somehow) caused the tank to explode.</a>

<p>
<a name="2216qlink3">When I was a teenager, I and my friends were mentally retarded.  We
used to take aerosol cans, hold a match under the spray and make a
torch.  We found that engine starting fluid made the best torch: oh my,
one could raise hell with one of those things.</a>

<p>
<a name="2216qlink4">One day, while burning trash, an empty (presumably) hairspray can
exploded.  Made a great fireball.  We reasoned that a full can would
do all that much more, so we bought a full can of engine starting fluid,
built a fire, threw the can in and ran like hell.  We waited and after a
surprisingly long time (a couple of minutes) in the fire, the can
finally
<br>
burst.

<p>
Did you guess what happened?  It doused the fire!  No fireball!
Waste of three bucks!  {8^D  I hope I never have kids.  spike
