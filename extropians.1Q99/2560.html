<i>&gt; danger in setting up kook-control systems is the memetic equivalent</i><br>

<i>&gt; may endanger our future ability to deal with it, and may encourage</i><br>
<i>&gt; more robust forms of kookiness to evolve.  Far better for future</i><br>
<i>&gt; generations that we arm them to recognize and deal with it rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; than protecting them from it and leaving them defenseless.</i><br>

<i>&gt; Unlike Natasha, I'm not at all against calling names and making</i><br>
<i>&gt; judgments; that is good and valuable information too, and we should</i><br>
<i>&gt; not shirk from distributing it just because it is sometimes socially</i><br>
<i>&gt; unacceptable--even divisive and incendiary--to do so.  The fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt; such information causes violent reaction is itself a memetic disease</i><br>
<i>&gt; that more exposure may help us combat.  Call a kook a kook, and call</i><br>
<i>&gt; a genius a genius (I, for example, would nominate Ian Goddard and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Robin Hanson to my kook and genius lists, respectively, but it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; important to note that I do not killfile or otherwise ignore Ian--</i><br>
<i>&gt; he does come up with an occasional gem of idea, and he helps me</i><br>
<i>&gt; exercise my ability to describe kookiness and understand it.  Nor</i><br>
<i>&gt; do I canonize Robin; indeed I disagree with him more often than not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I do not want to lose the experience of either of them.)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Volume-based, rather than poster- or content-based, controls might</i><br>
<i>&gt; be safer, even though they risk limiting "good" info.  I have in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; past suggested an electronic version of Robin Hanson's equitalk; that</i><br>
<i>&gt; does have the advantage of judgment being totally decentralized,</i><br>
<i>&gt; allowing popular posters extra soapbox time, while not totally</i><br>
<i>&gt; silencing the chronically unpopular.  It is that last feature I see</i><br>
<i>&gt; as most important.  We have to have occasional exposure to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; memetic germs lest our antiseptic ideascape breed a race of memetic</i><br>

Makes sense. What about putting some shortened version of this
onto the subscribe page of the ExI site? At any rate my check
will be sent off tomorrow to ExI; this list has made a big
impact in my life, and I will do what I can to make sure it
sticks around.
