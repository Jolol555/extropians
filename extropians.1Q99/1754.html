  IAN: The Germans were not born with any inherent 
  predisposition to think in a unique way. A few more 
  heavy GovtMedia propaganda campaigns on the War on 
  Drugs and we could see what happened to Jews happen
  to drug users, or to militia groups, or to Waco Tx.

  The FBI et al pulled of an entire mini-holocaust 
  while the whole world was watching. The U.S. govt 
  makes the Nazis look like armatures in their ability 
  to control what people think. I was bought and sold 
  on the govt line until I saw, "Waco: the Big Lie."
  The power of a Big Lie to control any population 
  to lead it to do wrong is immediately present.
