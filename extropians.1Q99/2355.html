<p>
I just received my copy of Vernor Vinge's novel A Deepness in the Sky,
which I had preordered from Amazon.  I can't wait to read it.

<p>
There's an "Author's Note" at the beginning, which says, "...for what
it's worth, the initial sound in 'Qeng Ho' is the same as the initial
sound in the English word 'checker.'"

<p>
That was interesting, but I found myself wondering about his choice of
the word "checker" to exemplify the "ch" sound.  I immediately thought
of Larry Niven's short story "Rammer", which was made into his novel A
World out of Time.  In that story, the "checker" is the representative of
the all-powerful government State.  Maybe Vinge's use of the word was a
subtle tip of the hat to Niven, who wrote many stories about interstellar
civilizations which relied on sublight travel.
