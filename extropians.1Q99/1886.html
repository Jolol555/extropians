<a name="1892qlink1">  IAN: But your talking about (1) an aerodynamically- 
  stable airframe and (2) an aircraft slipping through
  the atmosphere at high speed. The scenario to which I 
  refer is the opposite, for the plane at its apex is
  demolished, wing(s) off, forward section gone... 
  a junk yard at 17,000 ft that is not subject to 
  the favorable aerodynamics you describe, and at 
  the peak of its apex where it stalled, it is 
  at rest, and thus has no velocity to trade. 
  Those facts exactly counter the counter,
  which was very logical to have raised.</a>

<p>
  The fastest-falling part of PAN AM 103, the wing,
  fell at great velocity, since it was, as you note, 
  subject to favorable aerodynamics, even as the rest
  of the aircraft was not, and yet it still fell 
  slower than the fall rate from rest in a vacuum.
