Well, we didn't send criminals up into space on the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo
programs, nor was Chuck Yeager a criminal. I don't know how many HIV positive
people I've met who have said that they would be happy to be guinea pigs for
testing AIDS drugs.

Then there is the market for research subjects. I guy I know gets paid $175 for
two hours each weekend to act as a test subject on an MRI imaging research
project. Extrapolating this to research like uploading, I'm sure that it would
be easy to find subjects among the terminally ill, to pay all of their medical
debts and extra to their families for the chance to possibly have themselves
uploaded. Uploading can be seen as potentially the final cure for terminal
illness.
