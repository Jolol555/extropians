For that matter, we are all mere humans.  It doesn't mean that being
human is part of being an Extropian.  Exactly the opposite, in fact;
just because we don't yet have the technological capability to live up
to our philosophy doesn't mean we ought to lower our standards.

<p>
In exactly the same sense, I feel that all use of force and coercion,
initiatory or retaliatory, is undesirable; but I don't think the present
unfair world permits the non-initiation of force.  Even if you don't
bomb a country until they bomb you, you'll still hit children who never
did you any harm.  And if Japan hadn't attacked and the US had followed
a strictly Libertarian philosophy, the Axis would have conquered the
world at a leisurely pace and then moved on to us.

<p>
Listen to those misgivings.  A deep philosophical justification of
Extropy from first principles is a nice thing to publish on your own
account, but those of us who have our own complex personal philosophies
would almost certainly disagree; it shouldn't be part of the
*definition*.  Besides, what if you're wrong?</a>
