Subject:	AUTHORS FOR NEW PHILOSOPHY SERIES
Date:	Tue, 12 Jan 1999 09:06:58 EST

ANNOUNCING A NEW BOOK SERIES
<br>
Central Problems of Philosophy
<br>
Series Editor: Dr John Shand

<p>
To be published by ACUMEN
<br>
Dear Philosophy Colleagues,

<p>
I am looking to commission authors for a new major series of books 
CENTRAL PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY, of which I am the Series Editor, to be 
published by the new London based press ACUMEN PUBLISHING. I am an 
Associate Lecturer in Philosophy at the Open University in Manchester, 
England. This is the third set of books of which I am Series Editor.
The series is aimed primarily at upper-level 
undergraduate/postgraduate students and, therefore, expects a 
reasonable degree of familiarity with philosophical argument from its 
readership. The books will be around 160pp or 55,000 words, and will 
aim to convey to the student a clear and rigorous understanding of 
persistent philosophical problems. Although introductions, the books 
are opportunities for authors to make a striking and fresh 
contribution to the subject, in the way it is tackled and the 
conclusions reached.
<br>
I am therefore making an open request to professional philosophers who 
think they may be able and willing to make a contribution to the 
CENTRAL PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY series to contact me. Please send this 
email on to any other appropriate philosophy lists.
We are looking to commission authors for the following titles (those 
marked * have already been filled)
<br>

<br>
Modality
<br>
Paradox
<br>
