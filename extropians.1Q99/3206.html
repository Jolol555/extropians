<a name="3240qlink1">Why?  Because social systems are the product of human emotions, and you
have to understand something to alter it properly.</a>  The only SF author I
know of who's displayed even the beginning of that understanding is Greg
Egan... and his only flirtation with true altered emotions (that I've
read) was in _Quarantine_.  I suppose you could call the "true Ensemble"
a novel social system, which it is, but it's displayed only in passing.

<a name="3222qlink3"><i>&gt; Many great "hard" science fiction novels</i><br>

Wouldn't help if they were.  All three disciplines, like psychology, are
"soft" sciences, and you can't build a book around them.  You'd need a
grounding in game theory, evolutionary psychology, neurology (especially
brain-damage cases) and cognitive science.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; Anyone know of</i><br>
<a href="3204.html#3206qlink3">&gt; examples of writing that attempt to extrapolate both the science and the</a><br>
<i>&gt; technology along with their effects on society to produce novel and</i><br>
<i>&gt; innovative social systems?</i><br>

<p>
Problem is, there hasn't been a really innovative social system that I
know of in the entire twentieth century; people still fall into the same
old patterns, creating hierarchies and pecking orders.  The only thing
that will really alter that is neurohacking or intelligence enhancement
of one kind or another; *maybe* collaborative filtering (or similar
computational coordination) would do it.

<p>
Most of the pieces listed above show the culture only in passing.  Only
_Deepness_ and _Aristoi_ show deliberately created, fully visualized,
and wholly new and different cultures intrinsically based on advanced technology.
