It is sort of an inverse relationship. A government which provides the most
successful environment for its citizens breeds the potential for greater decadence
unless there are measures to keep up the quality of the citizens, like making
citizenship a merit system. You must pass intelligence, knowledge, and ethical
tests to become a voting member of the polity.  Jerry Pournelle had such a system
on the planet Sparta in his CoDominium series of novels
