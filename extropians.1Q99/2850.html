Considering that the US has been letting the Russians use our early
warning satellite feeds because their own systems are not being
maintained and are not reliable, and considering the large number of
Russian space program people who are out of work, (keep in mind that to
get things done over there, you have to be a hacker) I think its highly
likely that it was someone or a group of someones like that. I also
don't buy the denials of British intelligence. The last thing they want
is for more people to think its possible, it will just entice more
wannabes to make attacks.
