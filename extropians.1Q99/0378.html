<p>
Yes.  However, I would disagree that morality *must* be "solely"
a creation of thinking.  For instance (to use the evolution example),
evolution can't happen without something to evolve, but would this
imply that the principles that directed evolution did not exist until
evolution actually occurred?  Similarly, a correct morality could
conceivably be built into the universe in the same way that
complex processes are, given the right circumstances in each
(living things for evolution; thought for morality).

<p>
Let me hasten to add that I am not *sure* that an objective
morality exists, but I do think that trying to discover such a
thing is a proper activity, unless and until it becomes apparent
that no such beastie exists.
