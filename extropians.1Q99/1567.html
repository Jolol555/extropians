AOL Lobbies for High-Speed Cable

 AOL Lobbies for High-Speed Cable
<p>
 	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ America Online is part of a lobbying coalition
 formed Wednesday with the aim of getting access to high-speed
 Internet and data lines controlled by cable TV companies.
<p>
 	   The announcement of the OpenNet coalition comes almost a week
 after the Federal Communications Commission decided not to open a
 proceeding that would force cable companies to share high-speed
 lines with their competitors.
<p>
 	   Still, the FCC said it would keep an eye on the matter to ensure
 that consumers' options for Internet service are not restricted.
<p>
 	   Access to the technology has pitted the cable industry against
 AOL and consumer and interest groups and has produced an intense
 lobbying battle over what the FCC and Congress should do.
<p>
 	   The coalition's ``scheme would surely slow broadband
 deployment,'' said National Cable Television Association President
 Decker Anstrom.
<p>
 	   In addition to AOL, others involved in the coalition are:
 MindSpring Enterprises, Prodigy Communications Corp., Netscape, US
 West, MCI WorldCom, Cable &amp; Wireless USA, Washington Association of
 Internet Service Providers, CyberRamp Internet Services,
 Bertelsmann Internet Services, ConnectNet and the Texas Internet
 Service Providers Association.
<p>
 	   US West President Sol Trujillo, attending a conference here,
 told reporters that his company will press lawmakers for
 legislation giving companies access to cable's high-speed lines. He
 also said US West will seek legislation permitting it and the
 nation's four other Bell companies to move data across local
 calling boundaries, something they aren't allowed to do now.
<p>
 	   AOL and MindSpring also were among groups urging the FCC to
 force cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. to provide rivals access
 to its high-speed lines as a condition of merging with AT&amp;T.
 Analysts are saying the FCC is not expected to impose that
 condition on the merger.
