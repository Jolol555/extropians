<p>
I have been reading almost everything there is to read about
transhumanism and extropy... and i feel that knowledge is like a chinese
fan opened in front of our faces - the more you open it, the less you
see... but if you take a peek here or there you can see/find the
unexpected....
<br>
Along with transhumanistic readings on the Net - the brain of the
superorganism that is society - I came across with Stephen Hawkings and
his acarobatics to understand the Universe, and suddenly i was struck by
an idea that can explain why the Universe Is... There is DNA, which i
will call DNA1 to  explain the creation and assembling of life, so why
there isn't  a DNA2 to explain the creation and assembling of the
Universe or Universes out there?... Another biological or physical
entity functioning in the realm of the very BIG as the other DNA
functions in the realm of the very small...
Isn't this in a sense the theory of the Unified Field that Einestein
spent the rest of his years looking for? The unity of the big and small?

<p>
Tell me what all of you think about this...
