I suspect you're confusing parsimony with over-simplification here.  Nice
try though.

<p>
OK.  But what if my theory is that the fear of death is at the core of our
mental architecture, and that we cope with this fear by relying on a belief
in an after-life?  (not that I'm proposing this, you understanding) Doesn't
this just as easily explain the pervasive and persistent presence of
religious belief systems?

<p>
<a href="2420.html#2498qlink4">&gt;I think that the current high retained levels of religion in the western</a><br>
<i>&gt;world cannot be explained by anything other than a genetic predisposition,</i><br>

I've observed that "intelligent" people are often "not-so-intelligent" with
respect to domains outside of their expertise.  Many never challenge their
belief systems because they were so acculturated early on and because it is
more socially adaptive since they must interact daily with others who have
been similarly acculturated.

<p>
I think there are a number of powerful psychological motivations to belief
in God but most of them boil down to the basic human need for HOPE.
