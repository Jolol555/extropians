HI,

<p>
If I read the following correctly, it seems to indicate that gross =
oxidative stress (free radical damage?) leads to 5 1/2 times the rate of =
telomeric shortening than normal cell doubling would. If true, doesn't =
this suggest a direct causal connection between the free radical theory =
of aging, and the telomeric/proliferative senesence apoptosis model? I =
had been thinking that the rate of telomeric shortening was a constant, =
and that the NUMBER of doublings was the only thing which invoked the =
Hayflick limit. Now, if I interpret the below correctly, there is a =
quintuple whammy when cell doubling occurs under free radical oxidative =
stress such as in crush injuries etc. Am I getting this right?

<p>
thx

Mild oxidative stress as exerted by culture of human WI-38 fibroblasts =
under 40% oxygen partial pressure blocks proliferation irreversibly =
after one to three population doublings. Hyperoxically blocked cells are =
similar to senescent ones in terms of general morphology and lipofuscin =
accumulation. Moreover, they, like senescent fibroblasts, are blocked =
preferentially in G1 as evident from DNA content measurements by flow =
cytometry. Southern blotting of AluI- and HinfI-restricted genomic DNA =
shows an increase of the rate of telomere shortening from 90 bp per =
population doubling under normoxia to more than 500 bp per population =
doubling under hyperoxia. In every case, proliferation is blocked if a =
telomere cutoff length of about 4 kb is arrived at. The fact that =
telomere length correlates with the final inhibition of proliferation =
under conditions of varied oxidative stress, while the population =
doubling level does not, suggests that telomere shortening provides the =
signal for cell cycle exit in senescence. In postmitotic cells, no =
further telomere shortening occurs. However, the sensitivity of terminal =
restriction fragments to S1 nuclease increases, indicating the =
accumulation of single-strand breaks in telomeres of nondividing =
fibroblasts. This effect is found both under normoxic and hyperoxic =
culture, although it is more pronounced under conditions of higher =
oxidative stress. It might be speculated that accumulation of =
single-strand breaks and the resultant loss of distal single-stranded =
fragments during replication could be a major cause of telomere =
shortening, possibly more important than incomplete replication per se
