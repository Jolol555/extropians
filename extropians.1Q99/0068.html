In a similar vein.  I've been pondering a course of action...a strategy if you
will.

<p>
<a name="0330qlink1">Since it has become obvious that the electoral system in this country is
useless ...that voting does nothing other than validate the system to be
further exploited by the parasites....er...politicians</a> and
bureaucrats.....then there ought to be some other course of action.

<p>
Obviously there is armed rebellion.  The "shoot all the lawyers" scenario.
While that would be very satisfying it would be extremely messy and
counterproductive in the long run.  (Read the breif explanation</a> of the fall of
<a name="0330qlink2">the Roman Empire in "The Lucifer Principal")

<p>
<a name="0075qlink2">So my suspicion is that the only other alternative is ridicule and scorn.
That is to make those sucking at the government tit feel extremely
uncomfortable and ashamed of their profession such that they abandon</a> it.  
</a>

<p>
I'm still thinking on this...but I find Dick's "tone" to be right in line with
viewpoint.
