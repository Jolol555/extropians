So you're saying that if a government doesn't want their enemy to attack
one of their strategic sites, they can just create a 'human shield' of
children and civilians, and the site will be off-limits in warfare? I
think not; that didn't deter British bombing of Dresden, American bombing
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or bombing of 'human-shielded' sites during the
Gulf War. If anyone committed a crime in that sense at Oklahoma City, it
was the Feds putting children in a building which was known to be a
target for numerous 'freedom fighters' day-dreaming of civil war.

<p>
Note that I'm not making any moral argument for or against McVeigh's
actions, merely arguing against this suggestion it was somehow much 
worse because he killed some kids. US government support for sanctions
against Iraq has killed many, many times as many children as McVeigh
did, yet there's no outcry against their actions.
