<a name="2455qlink1">Fact: This list is getting more attention (for instance, was
mentioned in the latest issue of MEME).

<p>
Fact: We want to make the best of this attention.

<p>
<a name="2433qlink1">Theory: If we dekookify the list, more newbies are likely</a> to
stick around longer- both absorbing our helpful ideas for
themselves, and at the same time helping to diversify our
discussions (hopefully in non-kookish ways :-).

<p>
Theory 2: If we dekookify the list, more ExI members would
renew memberships, and in general ExI would probably get a
lot more $$$; people would be much more willing to support
something they could really be 100% proud of. Also they would
be more likely to show their friends the list, thereby
increasing the newbies even further.

<p>
<a name="2460qlink1"><a name="2446qlink1">Incentive: I'll agree to contribute a minimum of $10,000 per
year to ExI for at least 5 years if we can make some progress
on this.
