<a name="0335qlink1">All of the following is IMHO.  The value judgments here are my own and
might not agree with those of the list-owner or its other members.  No
insult is intended to anyone.  Here goes...</a>

<p>
I recommend to reduce the amount of noise on the list, we adopt two
simple rules, which can be automated so that no one need moderate
the list.

<p>
<a name="0335qlink2">The fist is a post per day per member maximum.  This could be, say,
three posts per day.  By doing this, I think people who chime in on
everything would choose what to respond to more wisely.</a>

<p>
A potential problem with this is people who use multiple email addresses
(like me, but not to this list:) would be able to circumvent this rule.  I
think list-owner intervention might stop this, though I would hope list
members would obey the rule without such.

<p>
<a name="0335qlink3">The second is a limit on the size of each post.  This enforce trimming
posts, so that members don't quote<a name="0465qlink1"> the whole post, but only the part
</a>
they wish to respond</a> to.

<p>
<a name="0335qlink4">A problem with this is that combined with the post per day limit, the
length of a member's daily contribution would be very limited.  Even
so, if someone has something lenthy to post, he or she could post
a (temporary?) URL with the material or ask members to email him
or her for copies</a> of it.

<p>
I also suggest that if we do plan to adopt either or both of the above
rules, we do so for a probationary period just to make sure that list
quality and participation don't drop.  I wouldn't want to make the list
barren by enforcing such rules.  A probationary period of one month
might be good, then we can poll members to see if they think quality
has gone up or down.

<p>
Cheers!

P.S.:  Someone might have suggested the above before, but, if so,
I do not mean to steal her or his ideas.
