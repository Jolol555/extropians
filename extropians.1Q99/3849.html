You raised another point.

<p>
Once you have all of those things, sometimes you need to subtract students
to make a class really effective. I think that student participation is a
useful part of the cycle of learning and it appears as though, when a class
is too big, people tend to be taught like you move sheep through the
slaughterhouse.

<p>
How do students participate when conditions are overcrowded? Perhaps
students should spend most of their time at home learning on computers and
only part of their time in a class room. Seems like there are opportunities
to have stronger community participation as well.

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd certainly agree with that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I've noticed that the evolution of education has been severely inhibited.</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; IMO, it is a natural result of the fact that a government bureaucracy is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; charge of education.  They have no incentive to even care about whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; their methods work, and every incentive to fiercely resist any effort to</i><br>
<i>&gt; change the system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; A poorly educated nation is easiest to govern. Perhaps that is why so</i><br>
<i>&gt; little</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is spent educating our people. (in the USA)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, the U.S. spends quite a lot of money on education.  Teachers are</i><br>
<i>&gt; paid above-average wages (especially considering that 3-month vacation every</i><br>
<i>&gt; year), and the only schools that don't have basic materials are the ones</i><br>
<i>&gt; where the bureaucrats intercept all of the money before it reaches the</i><br>
<i>&gt; classroom.  The constant complaints about funding are another natural result</i><br>
<i>&gt; of bureaucracy - we could spend $1,000,000 a year per student, and they</i><br>
<i>&gt; would still claim to be short of money.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Having worked as a teacher, I would say that money is largely irrelevant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Once you have a classroom, furniture, books and a teacher, you have</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything money can buy that is actually helpful.  Spending vast sums on</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers, multimedia tools, field trips, and so on produces very little</i><br>
<i>&gt; benefit - what really matters is what the teacher and students do in that</i><br>
<i>&gt; classroom.</i><br>
