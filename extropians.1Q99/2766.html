                  Burning The Cosmic Commons: 
     Evolutionary Strategies For Interstellar Colonization

</a>Attempts to model interstellar colonization may seem hopelessly 
compromised by uncertainties regarding the technologies and 
preferences of advanced civilizations.  If light speed limits 
travel speeds, however, then a selection effect may eventually 
determine frontier behavior.  Making weak assumptions about 
colonization technology, we use this selection effect to predict 
colonists' behavior, including which oases they colonize, how long 
they stay there, how many seeds they then launch, how fast and far 
those seeds fly, and how behavior changes with increasing 
congestion.  This colonization model explains several astrophysical 
puzzles, predicting lone oases like ours, amid large quiet regions 
with vast unused resources.

<i>&gt;front, figuring that our locality is used up, or burnt out, so in </i><br>
<i>&gt;this concept *that's* why no obvious ET settlements!</i><br>

<p>
I think Hal (as always) presented a nice summary of my argument.
It's not so much that stuff behind the frontier is "used up" as
it is that its just not useful toward jumping ahead of the expanding
frontier.  Agents tempted to hang behind for a bit to use stuff
get selected out of the frontier of the wave.  

<p>
<a href="1288.html#2766qlink3">&gt;... just what could possibly be so important that it would get</a><br>
<i>&gt;used up, and prevent really expansive ET's from gradually expanding into all</i><br>
<i>&gt;available niches, including our solar system? For instance, one "life</i><br>
<i>&gt;essential" resource that comes to my mind is *phosphorus*, but I can't imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt;why phosphorus atoms would actually be destroyed by ET settlers? Actually, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;suppose that's two questions: first, any reason why nearby ET's couldn't be</i><br>
<i>&gt;communicative, but planet-bound, and, second, what's burned in the "Burning</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Commons" scenario?</i><br>

<p>
The model predicts that what gets used up are resources that support
fast growth of a seed into a site capable of launching more seeds.  
If seeds could grow faster in comets than in asteriods, for example,
then we might see systems with lots of asteriods but few comets left.  
Or maybe there was something even better than comets that we 
don't see because a wave came through here already.

<p>
Yes, and then maybe a third and forth wave as well.  

<p>
<a href="1291.html#2766qlink5">&gt;It seems difficulty to come up with an evolutionary scenario in which</a><br>
<i>&gt;life does not advance into every possible niche, so that we can say that</i><br>
<i>&gt;our own solar system just happens to have been skipped.  At best you</i><br>

<i>&gt;to spread through the galaxy that it just hasn't gotten here yet.  Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt;by combining the "we're relatively early" and "life misses niches"</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas you can make the numbers work out to give us a reasonable chance</i><br>
<i>&gt;of existing.</i><br>

<p>
How about this perspective: a section effect makes it easier 
to overestimate how fast our colonization wave will spread.  
The waves that passed this way before make the universe appear 
to conspire to make fast growth hard.  Yes, eventually it all 
gets filled in with life that hangs around for a long time, but 
this process may take longer than a naive analysis would suggest.
