 Tipler wanted to get transcendence with the deal, so he had to
 postulate infinite computing resources and knowledge for this to work,
 which only can (?) occur during a Big Crunch (hold your fingers
 crossed :-).
 
<p>
 I think the problem is talking about God with big 'G'. Why not gods
 with lower case 'g'? Maybe we're too monotheistic on this
 list. Personally I feel more pagan, and want to see mankind turn into
 a whole pantheon. A pantheon of gods with humor.  &gt;&gt;

<p>
Well put, Anders.

<p>
At some point in the future in this scenario we will still have enough
computing power and knowledge to get transcendence in the deal.

<p>
Big "G", little "g" ...... great point.  In my scenario God or god(s) should
still be quite human, and, I believe, not need us to "worship" him/her/them in
the traditional sense.  If he/she/they are as democratic as I suspect,
he/she/they want us to "add our distinctiveness to theirs" and also become god
<br>
(gods).<br>

<p>
As hinted to by Stewart Kaufman in "At Home in the Universe", I suspect that:

<p>
     Life emerged as a "phase change" when the primordial soup had enough
different molecules reacting and catalyzing reactions till it became self
sustaining and replicating.

<p>
     Self awareness occured as an emergant property when enough neurons,
synapses, etc. came into being in one creature.

<p>
     God will emerge when enough intelligences and computing power are
networked together, but he/she/they will be a corporate god, not just one
Supreme being.
