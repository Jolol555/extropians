It appears as if "Eliezer S. Yudkowsky" &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt; wrote:

You don't. 

<p>
Naturally the Catholic meme system defines itself the best. Meme systems
which don't define themselves as the best become extinct in the evolutionary
meme competition.

<p>
I see.  It appears as if your meme system makes you a sentience to avoid, maybe
even to terminate with extreme prejudice.  Thank you for the warning.

In the context of wishing to become a posthuman superintelligence you would
wish to avoid meme systems that told you "avoid medical help and die a
natural death since Moloch the Great wants that".

<a name="0365qlink1">When you select a meme system you should take into account the ramifications
of adopting the meme system.  After you have done it, you will find it much
harder to change from it.

<p>
As a hypothetical example of why we select the rule of avoiding killing:

<p>
"If we adopt the meme system that we should avoid killing then we need not
put lots of resources on avoid being killed (cf. Bosnia).  Therefore, we
should avoid killing."
