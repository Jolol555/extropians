From: "Michael S. Lorrey" &lt;retroman@together.net&gt;

<a href="1594.html#1648qlink1">&gt;Fortunately, there is plenty of statistical evidence to prove the</a><br>
<i>&gt;gun manufacturers innocent, and the manufacturers might want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;countersue to recover rewards for the REDUCED fatalities thanks to</i><br>
<i>&gt;private gun posession deterring crime.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="1594.html#1648qlink2">&gt;I can guarrantee that if the cities win, then there will</a><br>
<i>&gt;definitely be civil war across America. I know that the 900</i><br>
<i>&gt;employees of the Newport NH plant owned by Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co. will</i><br>
<i>&gt;not sit idly by, nor will the employees of SIG Arms, aslo based</i><br>
<i>&gt;here in NH.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1650qlink1">I remember the first day I joined the NRA, The local propagandist
paper the "Chicago Suntimes" had a full page add by Sarah Brady
saying "Help me fight the NRA".

<p>
Five minutes later, I called and became a member of the NRA then
NRA/ILA, and gave seven of my friends guest memberships for a year.</a>

<p>
<a name="1650qlink2">I've been an off again on again member ever since. I went out and
made some new purchases a few weeks ago, (Remmington 870 12 GA
Marine Magnum and HK USP 9mm) just in case.</a> I may have to send the
<a name="1650qlink3">NRA a check too, and maybe the ILA as well (and get my beeper back
</a>;) ).

<p>
I don't think the cities will win these cases, tobacco isn't
protected by the constitution, and there are enough of us to stop
any jury.

<p>
Batten down the hatches and gear up.
