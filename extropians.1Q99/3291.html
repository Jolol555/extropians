 "An Insulin Index of Foods: The Insulin Demand Generated by 1000-kJ
 Portions of Common Foods"

Abstract:

<p>
   The aim of this study was to systematically compare postprandial
 insulin responses to isoenergetic 1000 kJ (240-kcal) portions of several
 common foods. Correlations with nutrient content were determined.
 Thirty-eight foods separated into six food categories (fruit, bakery
 products, snacks, carbohydrate-rich foods, protein-rich foods, and
 breakfast cereals) were fed to groups of 11-13 healthy subjects.
 Finger-prick blood samples were obtained every 15 min over 120 min. An
 insulin score was calculated from the area under the insulin response
 curve for each food with use of white bread as the reference food (score

<UL>
  <li>  100%). Significant differences in insulin score were found both within
 and among the food categories and also among foods containing a similar
 amount of carbohydrate. Overall, glucose and insulin scores were highly
 correlated (r = 0.70, P &lt; 0.001, n = 38). However, protein-rich foods and
 bakery products (rich in fat and refined carbohydrate elicited insulin
 responses that were disproportionately higher than their glycemic
 responses. Total carbohydrate (r = 0.39, P &lt; 0.05, n = 36) and sugar (r =
 0.36, P &lt; 0.05,n = 36) contents were positively related to the mean
 insulin scores, whereas fat (r = -0.27, NS, n = 36) and protein (r =
 -0.24, NS ,n = 38) contents were negatively related. Consideration of
 insulin scores may be relevant to the dietary management and pathogenesis
 of non-insulin-dependant diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia and may
 help increase the accuracy of estimating preprandial insulin
 requirements.
