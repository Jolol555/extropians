It's a truism that email squeezes out nuance. It may be a false truism;
Americans today may just be so non-culturally-homogeneous, confused, poorly
schooled or unpracticed that our rudimentary skills are no match for the
medium. How many people can breathe genuine life into a cold reading of
Shakespeare? With that acknowleged...

<p>
As an external observer of the human condition, permit me to observe that

<p>
<a href="3309.html#3310qlink1">&gt;&gt; &gt; Eliezer seems to be projecting thoughts and beliefs into what I said.</a><br>
Why,
<br>
<a href="3309.html#3310qlink2">&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't know  -- that's a soft question of human psychology, and I don't</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; know Eliezer well enough to make an educated guess.</i><br>

<p>
...closely resembles use of several rhetorical tricks. Among them: appeal
to the unseen crowd, assumption of the mantle of objectivity,
metacommenting, and metacomment inflation. I see this happen a lot, and am
guilty of same. It looks like playing to the crowd, and it may well be,
regardless of what's said, claimed or thought by the exponent.

<p>
I'm not defending or attacking anyone, I'm just remarking on "posturing"
tendencies that can lead to problems in public forums (s/b "fora", but
people tend to misread that as "flora" :) ). 

<p>
For an interesting discussion of the tendency for public discourse to stray
in these ways, see the "kindle Cole" entries in Robert K. Merton's _On The
Shoulders of Giants_. He goes into some scholarly detail re the
Hooke-Newton debates and their own private vs. published communications. It
seems this sort of thing predates email lists by several hundred years.

<a href="3309.html#3310qlink3">&gt;&gt; No, you don't.</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; After publishing 350K about how to build minds in general, and 100K</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; about how to build mine in particular, I know far better than to trust</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; my mind.  But I do trust myself to accurately evaluate claims that my</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; mind functions in a particular way; or that someone else knows the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; emotional contents of my mind, and resultant functioning, better than I do.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Your claim follows a known pattern of generic conversational tactics</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; which have yet to produce useful self-analytic content, so I am not</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; granting it serious consideration.  This does involve an assumption</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; about the cognitive etiology of the claim; which, under The Rules, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; permitted to publicly mention *only* because defense against this class</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; of conversational tactics may require response on the same level.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Eliezer,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You seem to be taking great umbrage to the fact that I feel you are</i><br>
<i>&gt;misunderstanding what I said in my earlier posts.  Rest assured that that</i><br>
<i>&gt;happens to everyone at some time or another.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You should have noticed that I made no "claim" as to how your mind works,</i><br>
<i>&gt;only a hypothesis of projection (and not even a hypothesis as to what was</i><br>
<i>&gt;being projected) based on my perceptions of your mangling of my posts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Note the "seems to be" and "I do not know Eliezer" formulations -- I chose</i><br>
<i>&gt;those words very carefully to express tentativeness, though you</i><br>
<i>&gt;acknowledged them only for rhetorical purposes.  I could easily have said</i><br>
<i>&gt;something Freudian like "Eliezer is projecting his deep-seated belief of</i><br>
<i>&gt;_x_ into my posts," but I did not (I still don't even have an idea of what</i><br>
<i>&gt;I would put in place of _x_, were I to make such a statement).  You may</i><br>
<i>&gt;have published so many bytes on how minds work that you can make</i><br>
<i>&gt;assumptions about the cognitive etiology of my posts, but this is something</i><br>
<i>&gt;I did not do, and disavowed the ability to do, despite your assertion to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the contrary.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;All I was trying to get across is that you were setting up strawmen that</i><br>
<i>&gt;you attributed to me in order to make your points.  I agree with most of</i><br>
<i>&gt;your points, particularly the ones that are still being discussed in this</i><br>
<i>&gt;topic (and on which, from my perspective, you are still setting up</i><br>
<i>&gt;strawmen), but for some reason you can't see that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Maybe that reason is my fault, maybe it's yours.  However, I see no value</i><br>
<i>&gt;in publicly continuing a discussion about whether you understood my posts,</i><br>
<i>&gt;as it is unrelated to the purposes of the list.  You may post whatever you</i><br>
<i>&gt;like in response, and you may rest assured you can have the last word, no</i><br>
<i>&gt;matter how distorted I may feel your comments to be (that should satisfy</i><br>
<i>&gt;your unreferenced "Rules," if I may hazard an assumption as to how they</i><br>
<i>&gt;might work).  I hardly see any value in continuing such a discussion</i><br>
<i>&gt;privately, but I could be wrong and you are welcome to email me if you feel</i><br>
<i>&gt;there might be some value.</i><br>
