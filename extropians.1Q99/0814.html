Well, maybe. Check out:(Hotwired)

People all over the world are turning to the Net for the latest info
about what's going down in Iraq - everyone, that is, but the people of
Iraq, who have no Internet systems or services whatsoever.

<p>
<a href="0394.html#0814qlink3">&gt; &gt; The term "naive" is strong.  I began using this term when, during a</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; debate on red goo vs. blue goo, I pointed out nobody had proposed any</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sort of active shield that would stand up to nuclear weapons,</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0851qlink2">I've put out a few scattered bits and pieces on this topic over the past
few years. One defense is simply bulk: all the nukes in the world today
would barely make a dent in Mt. Everest (a relatively tiny structure), nor
are they of much effect against deep underground installations.
Because a nuke has minimum size limitations, it's ammenable to early
detection via 'Star Wars' (or 'Land Wars') sensing and response.
As for an all-out strike, consider this- radionucleotides are scarce relative
to Si, C, H, Pb, etc. Explosive construction</a> can overwhelm.
<a name="0851qlink3">Of course the best defense of all is vacuum- lots</a> of it.

<p>
<a href="0338.html#0814qlink4">&gt; &gt;  Fact is,</a><br>
<a name="0864qlink1"><i>&gt; &gt; offensive technology is running far enough ahead of defensive technology</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to blast civilization right now, fair or unfair, and I think the problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will only get worse.</i><br>

<p>
I don't agree at all. The efficacy of offensive and defensive measures
change place over time, historically. The current situation is temporary.
Even a simple strategy like change of address (e.g. Mars) will tip the
balance back.

<p>
<a href="0394.html#0814qlink5">&gt; The important thing is to do a threat analysis, and try to see what</a><br>
<i>&gt; countermeasures (including the 36th stratagem, running away)</i><br>

<p>
 Isn't this number 1 stategem? I've only lost one fight in my
entire life, when I slipped going around a corner.</a>
