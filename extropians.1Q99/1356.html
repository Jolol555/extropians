  IAN: Exactly. Considering the magnitude of what's
  being discussed, an issue that runs the balance 
  between civil society and mass atrocity, the 
  wording of these laws can allow for no ambiguity,
  and yet, as we can see, it's there. We have to try 
  to read any loophole into the law, since those who 
  the law regulates will also look for any loophole,
  and if we can find the holes, they'll find them too. 

<p>
  Now I'll admit that 1520(a) looks pretty good on its
  face, but it only restrains the Secretary of Defense.

<p>
  The fact that the law is dancing around and spitting
  hairs over the idea of testing poisons on "civilian 
  populations" is by itself a red flag of great danger!
  It's clear that someone wants to do it, that others
  have tried to impose limits, but the limits are not 
  comprehensive and the impression that 1520 was just 
  an imposition on an on-going operation leaves me
  with the impression that such Ops have been occurring.
