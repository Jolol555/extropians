GOOD NEWS! I've learned that Section 1520 of Title 50 
Chapter 23 was REPEALED on November 18, 1997! However,
the Cornell Law School on-line library has NOT updated 
the U.S. Code since then, even though it says at their
site that "Updated information will be added here within 
24 hours of its availability from the House," suggesting
that shortly after laws are passed or repealed they'll be 
posted, but in fact over 9,000 hours have passed so far.
The problem is that the House hasn't made it available.

<p>
No search engine I've used can find the fact that 1520 
was repealed. All on-line government archives I've found 
list the old law as law. However, I discovered that 1520 
was repealed thanks to someone who accessed a pay-for-
use on-line law resource. Section 1520 was replaced with 
1520(a), which was sent to me (quoted below in full).

<p>
Many webpages of private researchers cite Section 1520, 
and Art Bell mentioned it last evening. Many of those
who are interested in 1520 are not aware of its repeal,
so please send this message to anyone not aware of such!

<p>
Interesting that the now-repealed Section 1520 of Title 
50 (which allowed chemical warfare testing on "civilian 
populations") was enacted under Jimmy Carter's term in 
1977 (not 1996), which seems interesting to me in light
of the fact that Carter has such a humanitarian image. 

<p>
Here's the replacement law. My only problem with it is 
that the ONLY entity it prohibits from conducting tests 
on civilian populations is the Secretary of the Defense, 
yet bio-warfare-related laws often cite the President as
the ultimate conductor of actions, yet the new law does 
not place any prohibition on the President or any other 
federal official except the Secretary of the Defense.
