<a name="2028qlink3">Since we are dealing with four or more peices with PanAm 103 rather than just
two peices with TWA 800, you are obviously trying to compare apples</a> to oranges.
<a name="2028qlink4">The fact that TWA 800 was so few pieces while PanAm103 blew into so many with
less than a pound of plastique on board indicates that there likely was not a

<p>
comparing any of these to objects dropped in a complete vacuum is about the most

hardly. You and I are possibly the last people who should be giving expert
opinions on such things as aerodynamic profiles. I could probably manage it if I
sat down with several of my old text books for several hours, but your
simplistic 'analyses' are beneath consideration as credible analyses... I can
<a name="2044qlink1">tell you from personal experience that I give great credence to the fuel tank
fume blast, now that I know that the wire harnesses in that area were insulated
with kapton. Under the proper conditions kapton can be very explosive and
flammable.
