<a href="3746.html#3764qlink1">&gt;School like that require you to be a self starter and capable of</a><br>
<i>&gt;learning directly from a book....Young, smart people should never be </i><br>
<i>&gt;subjected to absolutely no structure.  We blow things up.</i><br>

<p>
Although I have blown up my fair share of stuff, I wouldn't say that is 
was for lack of structure.  I often find myself focusing more on 
strategies for passing my classes, getting the grades I want (and need), 
and just generally how to navigate through the all bureaucracy. I think 
that for some a structure-less environment would facilitate learning and 
productivity.  Anyone who must be forced to learn doesn't really belong 
in school.  Self starters of the world unite!
