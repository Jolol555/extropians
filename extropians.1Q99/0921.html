Actually, aging is due now to natural wear and tear.  Also, our bodies replace all of their composite atoms in less than a year.  It is the strutural intelligence of our bodies that remains throughout this natural atomic replacement.  Therefore, with a sufficiently detailed description of a youthful body, nanotechnology could very easily extend and maintain your human form indefinitely - certainly well past a mere 3338 years (which sounds suspiciosuly arbitrary to me).
