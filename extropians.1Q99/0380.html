I doubt it, at least not in any sense of deity recognized by modern
</a>theologians<a name="0437qlink2"> (although it might fit with the plural and anthropomorphic gods
of Greek, Roman and Norse mythology, not to mention Xena and a lot of Star
Trek eps).  If you build a snazzy alife sim and its GAs construct
intelligent CAs, you'd be a kind of bridging `first cause', and might even
have the power to intervene in their lives - even obliterate their entire
experienced cosmos</a> - but that wouldn't make you a god in any interesting
<a name="0437qlink3">sense.  Gods are ontologically distinct from creatures, or they're not
worth the paper they're written</a> on.

<a name="0437qlink4"><i>&gt;There is also the possibility </i><br>

<i>&gt;existence of godlike physical creatures somewhere (but would these </i><br>
<i>&gt;be real gods?). </i><br>

<p>
Again, I think this is an abuse of language.  In an infinite universe there
would be very powerful beings by that path; there could not (I think, but
my set theory isn't remotely up to this) be a quantum fluctuation that
yielded an infinite volitional entity coextensive with *all* those infinite
worlds.  And even with Gott-like (ha) closed timelike curves, I doubt that
</a>
there could be a fluctuation that took the form of the logically earliest
volitional entity that *preceded* itself and its own ontic context (unless
it is the universe in toto).

<p>
Moreover, I suspect this line of thought is self-refuting: shouldn't there
also be (1) an *infinite* number of distinct gods so produced; and (b) at
least one catastrophic transcendental event, perhaps accidental, perhaps
done by a Mad Mind, that obliterates all these infinite universes?  Or
would such obliteration, like a vacuum catastrophe, have to proceed from a
center outward at the speed of light?  If so, any god postulated as its
cause is crucially limited, and fails the definition accepted by most
(Western) theists.

<p>
<i>&gt;And there is the possibility that there might be a </i><br>
<a href="0369.html#0380qlink3">&gt;kind of neoplatonistic god, a "creative principle" which might </a><br>
<i>&gt;explain why the world exists (though I think that looks highly </i><br>
<i>&gt;problematic).</i><br>

<p>
This sounds something like the array of current sub-theological
representations of deity (as far as I know; I'm hardly an expert in gods)
that is adduced by scientists such as, say, Paul Davies.  I don't see how
it makes sense as a proposition (so I guess I'm a noncognitivist in Max's
terms, although it sounds like a nasty label to accept), but that might be
a limitation of imagination.
