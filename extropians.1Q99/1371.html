  IAN: I've shown how collectives, like life, have 
  attributes that individuals DO NOT have, yet the 
  composition fallacy is confined only to alleging 
  a false similarity between part and whole. See:

<a href="http://www.assiniboinec.mb.ca/user/downes/fallacy/compos.htm">http://www.assiniboinec.mb.ca/user/downes/fallacy/compos.htm</a> 

<p>
  So my showing that a collective has attributes that 
  an individual does NOT have as the basis for defining 
  the "entityness" of a group is opposite to the fallacy 
  of composition, which pertains only to assuming a thing 
  they DO (but in fact do not) have in common, and thus 
  my analysis negates your composition-fallacy claim.

<p>
  As we've observed, considering a composite system 
  (like an atom, a stone, a person, or a galaxy) as 
  an entity doesn't create a contradiction, indeed,
  seeing the collective entity is a key to knowledge.

<p>
  The price of broccoli in a free market measures 
  "the good of society" (which you call a "delusion") 
  since it is the voice of society (demand) measured 
  against the supply of that which is demanded. To 
  deny the social entity is to deny economics, which 
  necessarily sees society as a composite entity.

<p>
  IAN: Actually it was Freespeak's word, not

  you called the group entity a "delusion."
