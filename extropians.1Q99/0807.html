<a name="0831qlink1">Actually, there are several specialized philosophy journals, such as The
Philosophy of Biology, that have had quite a number of "species papers" for
the past 25 years. The big issue has been if species can be considered a
"class" or an "individual" concept.

<p>
Science has a metaphysics too! Philosophers and Scientists need to keep each
other in check sometimes.

<i>&gt; &gt; I recently completed a draft of a paper that I'm going to send to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; philosophy journals. I want to get it off ASAP, but I'd appreciate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; feedback before doing so.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure why you would submit suggestions for new species</i><br>
<i>&gt; classifications to philosophy journals.  I realize that your expertise</i><br>
<i>&gt; is in philosophy, but if this is a serious suggestion for the extension</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the biological nomenclature, you need to send it for peer-review to</i><br>
<i>&gt; those who develop and confirm said nomenclature.  Unless the philosophy</i><br>
<i>&gt; journals you are considering are specifically intended to address the</i><br>
<i>&gt; philosophy of biological nomenclature, I would suggest that your</i><br>
<i>&gt; submission might be misdirected.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If it has not been reviewed by a biologist, and if you do not have</i><br>
<i>&gt; specific training in biological nomenclature, you could easily be</i><br>
<i>&gt; including very basic mistakes in your paper that would mar its serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; consideration.  Just as an example, are you aware that biologists curse</i><br>
<i>&gt; the term "homosexual" as being unscientific?  It uses the Latin root</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead of the Greek prefix as do the terms "asexual," "bisexual,"</i><br>
<i>&gt; "heterosexual," "polysexual," and the like.  Whoever invented this term</i><br>
<i>&gt; did not know the proper biological conventions.  If you are not trained</i><br>
<i>&gt; in biological nomenclature, you could be making similar mistakes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As with any international standards, there are committees and</i><br>
<i>&gt; international agreements within the scientific community as to which</i><br>
<i>&gt; standards are acceptable and which are being developed.  If you publish</i><br>
<i>&gt; your suggestions outside the system, this could also mar its serious</i><br>
<i>&gt; reception.  Imagine if someone published a suggested change to</i><br>
<i>&gt; astronomical nomenclature on their own, or to mathematical notation on</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own.  It would not only be ignored, but would probably be directly</i><br>
<i>&gt; denounced by the standards bodies as being apocryphal and unapproved.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They may even pass a standard against its use.  The committee that</i><br>
<i>&gt; developed HTML was so angered by Netscape and Microsoft publishing "HTML</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3 compliant" browsers before the standard approval and with unofficial</i><br>
<i>&gt; and conflicting extensions, that they skipped version 3 and proclaimed</i><br>
<i>&gt; that any product claiming "HTML 3" was fraudulent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't mean to sound negative here, but I just wanted to warn you about</i><br>
<i>&gt; some of the pitfalls you might encounter in proposing scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt; nomenclature if you are not aware of the proper procedures to do this.</i><br>
