<a name="2188qlink1">You haven't included any information about the capital markets</a> in these countries
<a name="2188qlink2">during this period. The main argument for patents is as security to obtain
capital, and to establish a capacity to pay back capital without competetive
pressures diluting the firm's ability to do so. At first glance</a> I would venture to
<a name="2188qlink3">say that the reason those countries ended their experiments with no</a> patent laws
<a name="2188qlink4">was because too many of their businesses were either patenting</a> in other countries
<a name="2188qlink5">anyways and were not manufacturing in the patentless countries,</a> or the companies
<a name="2188qlink6">were losing the rights to their own products in countries which kept</a> patent laws,
<a name="2188qlink7">as competitors were patenting their products. The third reason would</a> have been
<a name="2188qlink8">because investors found that the payback on patentless products was not</a> as great
as patented ones...

<p>
<a name="2188qlink9">I would also imagine that those countries started seeing a lack of imports</a> of new
<a name="2188qlink10">technology, as companies were afraid of firms in those countries steal their
knowledge.<a name="2186qlink1"> If India were a shining light of modernity and industrialization, I
</a>
might put some credence to the anti-patent argument.</a> But they have not gone
<a name="2188qlink11">anywhere near their potential.</a> Their GDP has stagnated and unemployment is now 1/3
<a name="2188qlink12">of the population. They are an economic basketcase. China is enough</a> better that
<a name="2188qlink13">they have a useful system, even though to get patent protection it costs</a> a lot of
money in bribes...<a name="2188qlink14"> The so called 'pirate software' industry is mostly just a
scheme by which large software producers can avoid taxes....</a>
