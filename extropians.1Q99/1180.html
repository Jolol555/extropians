<a name="1186qlink1">My suggestion for inertial confinement fusion wasn't intended as a
"nanofusion" power source, but as a method of constructing fusion
weapons without carrying around a lot of uranium.  I specifically
originated the suggestion when someone purported to prove that
nanotechnological attacks would be less powerful than modern weaponry,
which is absurd.</a>

<p>
<a name="1186qlink2">I also wanted to demonstrate that war nano can easily use nuclear
weapons against an "active shield", as part of my generalized thesis
that nanowar tilts the attack/defense balance even farther towards
attack than the existing nuclear weapons standoff.</a>

<a name="1192qlink1"><a name="1186qlink3">If I really wanted to be speculative, with respect to "nanofusion", I
would ask why you couldn't focus nuclear reactions so as to catch
individual neutrons, or perhaps arrange materials so that a solid
barrier of neutron-catchers existed instead of a haphazard crystal.  I'd
expect nuclear reactions to be considerably more efficient once we start
working close to that scale.</a></a>
