If you advocate the use of violence and force to take away (steal)
that which was *earned* by an individual then yes, you are a looter. 
I see no distinction.  Wishing you had something that someone has
earned is different.  So is demanding that that person gives it to
you.  But, when you point a gun at that person's head (or have someone
else do it), then you've crossed the line and become a looter.

<p>
I don't see any grey areas.  Maybe I'm blinding myself, but I don't
think so.
