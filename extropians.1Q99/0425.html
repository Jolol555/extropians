<a name="0429qlink1">  IAN: Well, I don't believe animals are really so

  allowing the evolution of the animal called "human."

<p>
<a name="0442qlink1">  If degrees of rationality define rights possession, maybe
  we could beat up on some demented people, or use them in 
  experiments... "greater good" and such. Imagine that we 
  have an unbroken chain of primates before us, from tree 
  monkeys to humans with all the missing links, it's like 
  a morph from tree monkey to man with an individual for
  each step of the way. Which individual would you declare 
  the right to saw off their leg against their will and why?</a></a>

<p>
  For those in the primate chain that area only a little 
  "less rational" (a claim I dispute) could you only saw 
  their leg part way off? The human the saw can't touch, 
  the next guy it can touch, the next it scraps a little, 
  and by the time the rights-allocation gets down to that 
  tree-climbing dude, he can have his whole leg sawed off.?

<p>
  It's a fuzzy-logic scale of primate rights allocation.

<p>
  Of course a few humans might declare the right to saw all
  their legs off (Hitler et al), and some would declare NO 
  right to saw any legs off (nice folks), which is inherent
  in the fact that rights are ultimately what any one being 
  declares they are and what others can or can't stop, which
  means that in the final physical fact, "might makes rights,"
  which is not the preferable basis for an ethical ideology.


<p>
<a href="0400.html#0425qlink3">&gt;That said, our only "rights" are the right to self and the right to</a><br>
<i>&gt;property.  All other "rights" either flow from those two (like gun</i><br>
<i>&gt;ownership, police protection) or are bogus, nonexistent rights (rights</i><br>
<i>&gt;to medical care, "fair" wages, protection from "evil" monopolies, etc.).</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Animals certainly can't earn things of their own volition, so I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;think there's a question of animal property rights.</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: Animals can't earn things? If no animal earned
  a living, the human race would never have occurred.


<p>
<a href="0400.html#0425qlink4">&gt;Are there any other "rights?"  If I can own an animal, then I can</a><br>
<i>&gt;treat it as I wish.  If you (or government or whatever) decides that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can only treat my property (an animal in this case) in certain ways,</i><br>
<i>&gt;then I don't truly OWN it.  I'm just borrowing it from the government</i><br>
<i>&gt;which is nice enough to let me use it for certain pre-approved</i><br>
<i>&gt;functions...</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: There is a fringe school of libertarians who
  adopt that SAME philosophy with respect to children,
  such that they argue that they could kill their kids
  if they wanted to, and if anyone came to save them,
  the parents would have the right to shoot those
  coming to the child's rescue (one advocate of that 
  ideology actually threatened to shoot me as I was
  harshly critiquing that idea, which says something).

<p>
  That line-of argument fails to see an individual 
  being as an inherent self-owner, and seeing them 
  as such, to save a tortured child or animal is to 
  liberate a self-owner, not necessarily to claim 
  to own that self-owner, as your analysis states.
