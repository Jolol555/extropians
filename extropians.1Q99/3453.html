Thanks for the welcome Anders. I am sorry for the delay in my reply but
I have been back and forth to hospitals since November trying to get an
operation for an injury to my right thigh. I have spent very little time
at home. My to be answered folder is bulging.

<p>
To answer your question I must say that I don't know. I have recently
moved here from Oslo (may last year). The reason being a desire for a
better environment. It has done wonders for me to be out here but I fell
down a slope one night and ruptured my quadriceps tendon totally. What
you gain on the roundabouts you lose on the swings.

<p>
I have often wondered if the mortality of man is not linked to his/her
desire for death. Some cultures speak of the death spot or the
equivalent. Self hate must play a role but how big a role?

<p>
I have been working on allowing myself to succeed to a greater degree
than I have before and it seems to work. Being separated from the stress
of being surrounded by many people has made a great change. Where I live
a car drives by twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the
evening. When I first came here I didn't think much about it. Now it
irritates me.

<p>
Just think of the irritation that I must have been suppressing when I
lived in the middle of Oslo where the tram rattled by every fifteen
minutes and there was heavy traffic outside my window from early in the
morning to late at night. When that was over the sound of drunk people
and fighting often echoed in the street below until the wee hours of the
morning. Can such an environment encourage a love of life?

At bottom, principle is not a finished product that can be
grasped. It is invisible. The details and order of material force is
a principle that is visible. Therefore, the first time there is any
principle is when it is seen in material force. After principles
have thus been found, they of course appear to become
tendencies.
