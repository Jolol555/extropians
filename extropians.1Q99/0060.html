<a name="0065qlink1">Inflation would enlarge the regions of causal contact by an 
astronomically large but still finite factor (though there 
are so many versions of inflation theory now that 
it's difficult to be sure that this is true in all of them.) But then 
I don't see how it would give you an infinitely large region of 
stuff that has been in causal contact.</a>
