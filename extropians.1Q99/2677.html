<a name="2694qlink1">Did you see the sources for the stats I posted?  They were from pro-gun
sources and showed &gt;200 children aged 14 and below being accidentally
shot to death every year in the U.S.  This figure is much lower than
other accidents from pools, cribs, skateboards, shaking, and the like.

<p>
I mentioned your statement that some stats count under age 25 as
"children", and a friend reminded me that under age 21 is defined as a
"minor" for alcoholic purposes.  It blew my mind that someone would
defend calling a 20-year-old a "minor"!
