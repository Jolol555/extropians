Lee Daniel Crocker, &lt;lcrocker@mercury.colossus.net&gt;, writes, regarding
whether development would be slower without patents:

<p>
<a name="0082qlink1"><a href="0076.html#0078qlink1">&gt; But it _has_ been tested: the thousands of years of human history</a><br>
<i>&gt; before the newfangled idea of patents were as productive and</i><br>
<i>&gt; creative as today.  Agriculture, construction, toolmaking, money,</i><br>
<i>&gt; clothing, cooking, boats, roads, water power, and countless other</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologies that are so commonplace we hardly think of them as</i><br>
<i>&gt; high-tech were all invented long before patents.</i><br>

<p>
On the contrary, it took thousands of years for these inventions to
be developed.  The rate of advancement was far slower in the past
than it is today.

<p>
Historical tests like this are not very meaningful, because so many
variables are changing.  We saw an increase in economic growth rates, from
a doubling time of 500-1000 years to one of about 100 years in the 18th
century, with a futher increase to a doubling time of 10-20 years in the
20th century.  Someone who wanted to promote patents could suggest that
they played a large role in motivating this increase,</a> and that without
patents we would be back to 500-1000 years to double our economic output.
