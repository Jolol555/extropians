Tim,

<p>
   I think I see my misunderstanding...by Coventry, you are advocating a form
of behavior control based on reputation, without involvement of any
organization/governmental force.  This would certainly be in keeping with
Extropian values.  However, since this will be a sort of electronic village,
as you say, there is one thing which bothers me.  I have always found the
relative annonymity of modern society a strength in that it gives individuals
the chance to constantly reinvent themselves, something that is much more
difficult to do when everyone knows every bonehead move you've pulled in your
life.

<p>
