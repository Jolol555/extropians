Me too.  You're right...350 averaged is probably high.

Seems like it ought to still get a bit warm to me, too.  However, they
*are* doing extensive computational aerodynamics and are relying heavily
on hypersonic rotor wind tunnel work that NASA did in the 60's.  Amazing
all the stuff gathering dust in their libraries.</a>

Watch me back-peddle...  Wouldn't take much to build a simplified
expendable that could beat the big guys in a fair contest.<a name="0293qlink1">  But I'm not
sure you would get a fair contest.</a>  I think you need something
overwhelming superior and difficult for them to duplicate to survive the
economic/legal/political power they can bring to bear.  Don't get me
wrong, I'm not talking secret conspiracies...just good old fashioned
hardball.

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Oh, no!  I didn't mean you!  All those *other* rocket scientists &lt;grin&gt;.

<i>&gt; consider this tho: i have a version of a roton,</i><br>
<a href="0233.html#0248qlink5">&gt; been making sketches and calcs for a few months now.  it is a two</a><br>
<i>&gt; stage, both rotary, with no recoverables *but* it is verrry simple.</i><br>
<i>&gt; given economies of scale, the parts could be mass produced and</i><br>
<i>&gt; still beat up on the big boys.  my version has lox/methane first stage</i><br>
<i>&gt; and lox/hydrogen second.  i am trying to calculate my way out of</i><br>
<i>&gt; liquid hydrogen for the second stage, as it introduces so many handling</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficulties, but i give away a lot of performance without it.  i fear</i><br>
<i>&gt; even my 9500 m/s delta v is a bit optimistic.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0293qlink3">But doesn't the concept more or less require the fuel and oxydizer to be
closely matched in density?</a>  That's one of reasons they use kerosene, and
also one reason they use LOX for engine cooling (the pressure drop through
the cooling system brings it to the same pressure as the less dense
kerosene).  Wouldn't there be a 10 to 1 pressure difference with the LOX
and hydrogen?

<a name="0310qlink2"><a href="0233.html#0248qlink6">&gt; i tried to make it work with no despun section, but couldnt figure out</a><br>
<i>&gt; how to guide the turn, so, i end up with a despun platform forward</i><br>
<i>&gt; that holds the payload.  problem im having is that the cross sectional</i><br>
<i>&gt; area is large, so i lose an awful lot to drag.  i wonder if i could get</i><br>
<i>&gt; a mountain top launch site?  a high one could get me out of half</i><br>
<i>&gt; the atmosphere.  the environmental types wouldnt like it tho.  spike</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0293qlink4">Is it because the low denity fuel requires a large diameter?</a>  Higher
density fuel can make it much more compact.<a name="0293qlink5">  And I would think that
rotating the feul tanks are more trouble than they are worth...</a>slow, low
pressure rotating seals aren't *that* hard.
