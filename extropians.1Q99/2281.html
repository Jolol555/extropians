Still beating the dead horse of subjective morals I see.</a> Survival is not as
important as evolution.<a name="2464qlink3"> It is not extropic to want to live a million years, but to
not learn anything or change one whit the whole time. The Prime Directive of
Extropy is that all individuals should have the freedom to learn, to experience,
to change as the individual sees fit. Being able to live long enough to fill that
to the individuals satisfaction is a part of that freedom, but not a prerequisite.</a>

Any indivdual is free to contribute their lives to the fight for freedom. It is
the selfish altruism of liberty for which any real human will die to give to
others.
