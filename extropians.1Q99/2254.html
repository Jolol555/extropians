Thanks for the thoughts and comments, let me try to answer some:

out...

<p>
Your thoughts somewhat parallel my own, so thanks for the extra 
insights. I know there are other ways out, that's one of the reason this 
interests me.

<i>&gt;Sorry I lost the original post.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I humbly suggest that you reconsider your intentions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;What bothers me is that you state that you have a </i><br>
<i>&gt;very particular question you feel the need to answer.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Already a bad sign.  In addition, this question has </i><br>
<i>&gt;something to do with you and your personal experiences.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;IOW, you seem to be seeking to understand yourself </i><br>
<i>&gt;more completely.  Though laudable, this is not a good </i><br>
<i>&gt;reason to become a psychiatrist or cognitive scientist.</i><br>

<p>
Actually the whole area interests me, and it has less to do with me than 
with people I know. I don't seem to be prone to depression at all, but I 
know some very intelligent people who are. 

<p>
<a href="2205.html#2254qlink3">&gt;Seek this line of work because you are completely </a><br>
<i>&gt;fascinated with it and because you truly wish to make a </i><br>
<i>&gt;contribution to the science, knowing full well that you are </i><br>
<i>&gt;currently too ignorant/naive to know precisely how you will </i><br>
<i>&gt;accomplish this task.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Best wishes,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

This pretty much does sum up my interest, and a number of related areas 
(language, psychiatry, neuroscience) seem to be involved. I think there 
should have been two separate questions (1-resources for finding out 
about cognitive science 2-a specific question about intelligence and 
lack of direction/depression). I do think if I could figure this one out 
I would be contributing to science and humanity, by freeing the 
intelligent/creative to be more productive (this negates the argument 
that madness moves a number of intelligent/geniuses). 
Thanks, 
<br>
Mike
