IMHO, that's a fairly accurate way to look at it.  The main difference
between a tool that amplifies your intelligence and a specialized brain
function that makes you smarter is the quality of the interface.  Right now
the interface is terrible, so we think of computers as external tools.  As
interfaces get better it will begin to make sense to think of the computers
as being part of their owner's mind.
