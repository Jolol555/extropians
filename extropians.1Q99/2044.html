<a href="2025.html#2044qlink1">&gt; ...tell you from personal experience that I give great credence to the fuel tank</a><br>
<i>&gt; fume blast, now that I know that the wire harnesses in that area were insulated</i><br>

mike, i have never worried much about how a crippled plane could
descend faster than freefall in a vacuum: tail control surfaces could
issue a down command or the craft could have turned over, etc,
under full thrust.  all bets are off after a plane comes apart.

<p>
but i must admit, this scenario of a bad wire causing an explosion
of fumes inside the tank i have found troubling.  i would think
the vapor pressure of the kerosene would displace oxygen
sufficiently to prevent much oxygen from getting inside the tank,
even if scuffed or degraded insulation causes a spark.

<p>
<a name="2050qlink1">the fuel pump on my truck is inside the tank, submerged in gasoline,
unless the tank is nearly empty.  i would think the vapor pressure
of octane on a cool day would be lower than that of kerosene on
a warm day, yet there is never enough oxygen in a car's gas tank
to cause an explosion, even assuming a faulty fuel pump.  that
kapton has problems is acknowledged, but why would a spark
inside a fuel tank cause an explosion?

<p>
what is your experience?  i fly on these boeings about 40 times
a year.  i would hate to hafta worry that a tank could explode
at any time.  {8-[  spike
