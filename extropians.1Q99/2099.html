I suppose you are referring to the sentence: "Politically, the 
extropians align with libertarians on many economic and social 
issues, although this does not form part of their formal 
definition."; that is the only place in the FAQ where any association 
between extropians and libertarians is made.<a name="2102qlink1"> I could replace that 
sentence with a direct quote from The Extropian FAQ: "Politically, 
extropians are close kin to the libertarians" 
(<a href="http://www.extropy.com/faq/whatis.html">http://www.extropy.com/faq/whatis.html</a>), if that is more accurate. 
What do you think?

<a name="2102qlink2"><a href="2092.html#2099qlink2">&gt;Where you say, "The definition of transhumanism is based on </a><br>

<p>
<a name="2102qlink3">What I meant was that the definition used in the FAQ is especially 
due to these two people (and that is entirely accurate). So I could 
change it to "The definition used in this FAQ is based...". Would 
</a>that satisfy you?

<p>
<a name="2102qlink4"><i>&gt; Secondly, Max More originally defined Transhumanism. </i><br>

<p>
With all due respect to Max, I don't think that is quite accurate. 
The term was coined by Julian Huxley in 1957. The concept has 
formed gradually under the influence of many people, including 
important contributions from Max. But no one person defined or 
originated transhumanism.</a>
