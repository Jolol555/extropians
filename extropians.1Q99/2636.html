<p>
 Back around 1993 or 1994, setting up one's own mailing list appeared
sufficiently hard that people tended to treat lists the way they treat
geographical regions - the cost of political battles over list management
appeared lower than the cost of moving to another list. The list maintainers
<a name="2680qlink1">were understandably reluctant to allow unlimited changes in legal systems
to people using the resources that the list maintainers owned, and never
made it clear what kind of competition they would allow.
</a>
 Times have changed, and setting up a competing list is now clearly easier
than producing competing legal systems within a given list.

<p>
 That software was closed source, and intended to make a profit for
it's authors. MajorDomo probably became a much more massive programming
project because it didn't restrict users from participating in the
programming effort.
