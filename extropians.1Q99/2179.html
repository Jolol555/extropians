   IAN: Before that became the leading theory 
   they canned the theory.</a> As The New York Times 
   (8/14/96) reported less than a month after the 
   crash: "Investigators examining the wreckage   
   ...concluded that the center fuel tank burned 
   as many as 24 seconds after the initial blast 
   that split apart the plane."

<p>
  IAN: If the NTSB could explain how a spark 
  could get into the tank, they would close the 
  case. Jet fuel is also not explosive at normal 
  temps <a href="http://members.aol.com/bardonia/washtime.htm">http://members.aol.com/bardonia/washtime.htm</a>

  IAN: For me, you can't break physical
<br>
  law, and saying an object with negative 
</a>
  aerodynamic advantage could fall from zero 
  vertical and almost zero horizontal velocity
  17,000 ft at a rate about 25% faster than the 
  rate of fall in a vacuum, is breaking the laws
  of physics, and thus that which is accepted as
  the truth cannot be the truth. That concerns me.

<p>
  This is what happens to an aircraft with no nose:
