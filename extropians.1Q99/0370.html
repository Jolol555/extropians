samael, i was a vegetarian for about 7 yrs (ages 15 to 22) and now i
am seriously considering returning to that diet.  first i must resolve this
issue: cattle and swine are slaughtered in the prime of their lives to
provide humanity with victuals, however, if we did not devour the
beasts, they would have no life at all.  so having some life is better than
never being born to start with.  fish, on the other hand are taken from
the wild, so i am close to deciding to never again scarf one, which is
a tough stance for one who loves sushi.  {8-[  of course, carrots too
are living things.

<p>
its another of lifes ironies, like "save the krill: nuke the whales."  {8-|
