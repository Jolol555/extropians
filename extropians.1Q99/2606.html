Maybe some of the ideas and principles reflected here
can be adapted for "building extropianism."

"I recently read your interview with the Penn State Young<br>
Americans for Freedom. Interestingly, I just left college
at the end of this past fall semester as a means to pursuing
a completely free life and consciousness. I was actually
contemplating writing a book (or possibly report) from a
recent student/dropout's perspective on "higher education"
and how it is the ultimate capstone to a childhood of
brainwashing and enfeeblement."

Interview between John Preston of the Penn State University
Young Americans for Freedom &lt;<a href="http://www.clubs.psu.edu/psyaf/">http://www.clubs.psu.edu/psyaf/</a>&gt;
and Frederick Mann &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com">http://www.buildfreedom.com</a>&gt;:
<hr>

<p>
Mr. Mann,
<br>
With your consent, I would like to conduct an interview
over e-mail with you for the Pennsylvania State University
Young Americans for Freedom newsletter. I think a celebrity
like yourself could offer a great viewpoint for such a
publication, and I'm sure many students would benefit from
reading your ideas. Also, the publication would be an
excellent way to advertise your activities, most notably
your website &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com">http://www.buildfreedom.com</a>&gt;. I'll ask some
questions, and you can e-mail me back the questions with
your answers. Keep in mind you may omit any questions you
object to. I would appreciate your responses, and will do
very little editing of them.

<p>
INTERVIEW:

<p>
Frederick Mann is an entrepreneur involved with several
successful businesses, the author of 'The Economic Rape
of America' &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/rapecon.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/rapecon.htm</a>&gt;
as well as many practical and useful reports, and the
founder of the Free World Order, also known as Terra
Libra.

<p>
PSYAF (John Preston): In your web site you advocate
<br>
"building" freedom instead of fighting tyranny or fighting<br>
for freedom. Can you explain what you mean by building
freedom?

<p>
Mann: One of the basic ideas of building freedom is that
the power of tyrants depends on the support they receive
from their victims. In general, such support takes the
forms of victims paying taxes to the tyrants, victims
obeying the tyrants, victims providing information about
themselves to the tyrants, victims allowing themselves
to be controlled and regulated by the tyrants, victims
demanding and utilizing "services" provided by the
tyrants, and victims participating in tyrant elections.

<p>
Another basic idea of building freedom is that when you
oppose something, there's often an almost automatic
reaction to increase the force against the opposition.
The extreme manifestation of this phenomenon is "enemies
have to be crushed." The Waco massacre was an example.

<p>
By building freedom I mean that individuals remove their
support from tyrants and tyrant systems to the extent
they practically can. They exit tyrant systems to the
extent they can get away with. They learn to live free
in an unfree world as far as possible. They create their
own freedom.

<p>
Living free requires what I call freedom technology,
which basically consists of the practical knowledge,
methods, and skills to outwit tyrants and run rings
around them, to organize your life and affairs so
tyrants leave you alone. Freedom technology includes
the means to defend yourself with minimal effort when
attacked by tyrants. If a cop pulls you over, you want
to handle the situation with least risk to yourself and
have the cop let you go as soon as possible. If a tyrant
sends you a threatening letter, the ideal is to respond
with one letter that induces that tyrant to leave you
alone in order to pursue other victims who are easier
prey.

<p>
A further aspect of building freedom is the creation of
institutions that make it easier, more convenient, and
safer for individuals to live free. Examples are in
areas such as transacting and banking free from tyrant
knowledge and control, business institutions that don't
steal part of your earnings to hand over to tyrants,
alternative health care, alternative energy systems,
alternative communication systems, etc. The Internet
is the best example of an institution that makes it
much easier for individuals to earn a livlihood while
living free.

<p>
PSYAF: If I understood correctly, you implied that
participating in political elections supports the
tyrants. Do you also think that the Libertarian Party
should be disbanded and libertarians shouldn't vote?

<p>
Mann: For the purpose of this interview, I distinguish
two levels of promoting freedom. So far I've been
talking about level two: withdrawing support from
tyrants and living free. Unfortunately, operating at
this level seems so unrealistic to many freedom lovers
that it's very difficult for them to even consider.

<p>
For most freedom lovers it's appropriate to operate
at what I call level-one freedom. This is the level
where you learn about freedom philosophy and principles,
try to educate others about freedom, support the
Libertarian Party, and so forth. This is the most
important level of promoting freedom, because it's
the best way to reach the masses.

<p>
Level one is also where freedom lovers campaign on
issues such as preventing Internet censorship, stopping
the "know-your-customer" bank regulations, fighting
the FDA, campaigning for hemp legalization, and so
forth.

<p>
Although I personally devote most of my time to
level-two freedom, I do also support the Libertarian
Party.

<p>
PSYAF: What prompted you to create the Free World Order?

<p>
Mann: It's an intended antidote to "New World Order."

<p>
PSYAF: Why did you choose the Latin phrase "Terra Libra?"

<p>
Mann: Actually, I think in proper Latin it would be
something like "Terra Libera," but "Terra Libra"
sounded better to me. Terra Libra is used to indicate
<br>
"Free Earth."<br>

<p>
Individuals, to the extent they have freed themselves,
are part of Terra Libra or the Free World Order. The
Internet and other freedom institutions are part of
Terra Libra or the Free World Order.

<p>
I distinguish three economic sectors: public, private,
and real free enterprise. The "public" sector is
basically the coercive or "master" sector. Their
primary modes of behavior are violence, threat of
violence, deception, fraud, and brainwashing.

<p>
The "private" sector is basically a kind of "slave"
sector controlled by the "master" public sector.
However, there are "masters" in the private sector
who "buy" public-sector tyrants in order to receive
special privileges such as monopoly licences, tariff
protection, subsidies, etc. Many private-sector
tyrants steal part of the earnings of their workers
to hand over to public-sector tyrants. From the point
of view of building freedom, the private sector is
as much an enemy of freedom as the public sector.

<p>
The real free-enterprise sector is based on property
rights, voluntary association and exchange, and is
essentially free from coercion and tyranny. Economic
activity free from fraud and coercion constitutes
Terra Libra or Free World Order. As individuals
free themselves, they shift more of their economic
activities into the real free-enterprise economy. I
call this the "Terra Libra Shift." It's an essential
aspect of building freedom.

<p>
PSYAF: In your web site, you include many topics ranging
from tax relief to health improvement? Why do you
cover such a broad range of topics?

<p>
Mann: Freedom can be regarded as the range of positive,
desirable options individuals have available to them.
One of those options is to own the fruits of your labor
to dispose of as you wish (provided you don't harm
others).

<p>
If you're ill in bed, your range of desirable options
is curtailed; you're less free. Building freedom
includes optimizing your health and fitness.

<p>
PSYAF: the Young Americans for Freedom and the ACLU are
hosting a debate on affirmative action at Pennsylvania
State University. Can you enlighten our readers as to
where you stand on affirmative action?

<p>
Mann: As I see it from an admittedly oversimplified
perspective, affirmative action involves the tyrant
stealing from Paul to pay Peter, because in the past
both Paul and the tyrant stole from Peter. Affirmative
action tends to make the "beneficiaries" more
dependent on handouts from the tyrant. In general,
individuals who want to build and maximize their
freedom shouldn't depend on affirmative action.

<p>
However, a ruthless freedom builder might argue,
<br>
"Whatever the tyrants have they have stolen. They<br>
are corrupt thieves not entitled to own anything.
They are fair game and I'm free to take from them
whatever I can get away with!"

<p>
PSYAF: I'm writing an opinion piece on Social Security
reform. I noticed in your web site you provided
information for individuals to drop out of the entire
Social Security system by relinquishing their SS
number? Can you provide more information on that
for our readers?

<p>
Mann: Some people go to the extreme of actually
relinquishing their SS number. In my opinion, for
most freedom lovers this is not a practical course,
particularly if they remain dependent on "the system"
for their income. To operate completely without an SS
number may require considerable legal knowledge and
skills, as well as having one or more income streams
in the real free-enterprise sector. Nevertheless, I
do know of people who manage reasonably well without
SS numbers.

<p>
PSYAF: Where do you stand on the right of private
citizens to own firearms?

<p>
Mann: The ultimate obstacle to absolute tyranny is
private ownership of guns. Tyrants know this and will
do their utmost to eliminate individual gun ownership.
Some of the American Founding Fathers knew this, and
that's why the right of individual gun ownership is
enshrined in the Second Amendment to the Constitution,
in the Bill of Rights. Freedom-loving Americans should
regard the right to private firearms ownership as
inviolable.

<p>
PSYAF: What do you see as the biggest obstacle to
individual freedom?

<p>
Mann: Undoubtedly that so many freedom lovers work at
9-5 jobs in the private sector, essentially supporting
the tyrant system that enslaves people. I suspect that
most freedom activists operating in the private sector
have not even considered the degree to which they
support the coercive political system through their
work. If these people could find ways to become
financially independent in the real free-enterpise
sector, they would not only withdraw a great deal of
support from the tyrants, but they would also have
much more time available for promoting freedom.

<p>
PSYAF: Are you suggesting that freedom lovers operate
in the "black market" or "underground economy?" Isn't
this too dangerous for most?

<p>
Mann: Actually, there's a very important aspect of
the power of tyrants that many people don't fully
appreciate. Much of tyrant power depends on their
having information about their victims. People in
the private sector typically provide most of the
information tyrants need to control them. People in
the real free-enterprise sector, as a rule, don't
provide information to tyrants. (This is one reason
why tyrants would love to implement measures such
as the "know-your-customer" banking regulations.)
Provided you're discreet and prudent, you may in
fact be less at risk from tyrant coercion in the
real free-enterprise sector than in the private
sector.

<p>
PSYAF: But aren't you advocating that freedom activists
break the law?

<p>
Mann: In the USA, the senior law of the land is
the US Constitution, the framers of which largely
intended real free enterprise, in support of which
there is considerable case law, such as the famous
case of Hale vs Henkel. There is also case law that
says that laws contrary to the Constitution are
null and void. I advocate that all real laws be
obeyed to the letter.

<p>
PSYAF: You obviously think that your level-two strategy
is superior to the level-one strategies most of us
are involved in. Why is this?

<p>
Mann: The disadvantage from the individual's point
of view with level-one strategies is that you can
spend many years -- and a great deal of money --
hoping for greater liberty in the distant future,
while remaining enslaved in important ways. Many
level-one freedom activists become disillusioned
because of lack of results and suffer "burn out."
The great advantage of level-two freedom strategies
is that you can very quickly enjoy the benefits of
freedom -- and keep most or all of the money you
earn to boot!

<p>
PSYAF: What do you think the future will be like in
America and the world in terms of liberty?

<p>
Mann: I expect that, as it becomes easier for
individuals to free themselves because of
institutions like the Internet, the tyrants
will become more desperate and vicious in their
attempts to enslave their victims. There may be
more "Wacos."

<p>
There are many people on the cusp or margin
between liberty and slavery. As the tyrants
become more vicious and desperate, more people
will be pushed to the liberty side. Also, the
more repressive tyrants become, the greater
the benefits of escaping the tyranny.

<p>
&gt;From their perspective, the violence mode works
for tyrants. (Of course, they disguise it as
<br>
"helping the children," etc.) The tyrants receive<br>
a "return on violence" in an economic sense. The
businessman wants a return on investment. The
tyrant wants a return on violence. People (at
least those who aren't too brainwashed) pay
taxes to avoid violence against themselves. The
tyrants' return on violence includes receiving
taxes.

<p>
With the advent of the Internet and other freedom
institutions, it becomes more difficult for tyrants
to control their victims, and their return on
violence diminishes. Much of their power depends
on a diminishing return on violence. Hence I see
a great expansion of freedom, both in America
and in the rest of the world, for those who take
the initiative to free themselves and to build
their freedom.

<p>
Tyrants all over the world, operating in accordance
with a 'de facto' constitution "Everything goes...
that we can get away with," may seek to make
examples of some of those who attempt to build their
own freedom and subject them to "Waco-like" treatment.

<p>
In order to control those who choose to remain
enslaved in coercive political systems, tyrants will
most likely do their best to further curtail liberty.

<p>
Overall, I see more freedom for those who free
themselves and less liberty for those who choose
to remain enslaved in coercive political systems.

<p>
PSYAF: What are your plans for the future?

<p>
Mann: The priority I'm working on right now is
to improve the ability of individuals to become
financially independent outside coercive
political systems.

<p>
The next priority to be tackled will be in the area
of providing the means whereby individuals can improve
their thinking skills.

<p>
PSYAF: What do you think the average college student
could do to increase his/her personal freedom?

<p>
Mann: Develop one or more income streams in the real
free-enterprise sector. Concentrate on improving
thinking skills. Drop out of college at the earliest
practical opportunity and educate yourself.

<p>
PSYAF: Is there any other advice you have for
freedom-loving people?

<p>
Mann: Learn to question everything, including
everything you "know" about freedom or liberty,
and everything you "know" needs to be done to
expand freedom or liberty.

<p>
PSYAF: Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Mann.
It was a pleasure talking to you.

<p>
Mann: You're most welcome!
