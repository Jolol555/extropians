<a href="3780.html#3782qlink1">&gt; BTW, the nanobe story doesn't fall into the same category, as far as I can</a><br>
<i>&gt; tell.  It was picked up by all the major serious news outlets in Oz, can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; traced back to journal articles in what look like sound peer reviewed</i><br>
<i>&gt; journals (I haven't gone to the uni stacks and sought the refs out), and</i><br>
<i>&gt; can be found linked from various reputable university research sites.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; think it's safe to assume that the nanobe claims are perfectly serious.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (They might also turn out to be misunderstood non-controversial</i><br>
<i>&gt; commonplaces, of course.) </i><br>

<p>
I agree the nanobe story is for real.  I do wonder whether they made a
mistake,
<br>
though.  They claim to have found organisms with diameters down to 20 nm
which contain DNA.  That's awful small.  There's room for a lipid layer, a DNA
helix, and that's about it - in other words, a helical DNA virus.  How could
such
<br>
a thing metabolize?  I suspect they found either viruses or chromatin strands
from dead and lysed eukaryotes.  I also note they published in a geological
journal rather than a biological journal, where this discovery would belong.
I expect they did find something interesting but probably not the 
"nanobacteria" some have been talking about.  I expect we'll see a lot more
work on this in a few months.
