In order to make human-equivalent AI we will have to have</a> a larger knowledge

knowledge bases between projects is perfectly feasible, and I expect it to
become more common as AIs become more complex.  The key point is that once
you have a body of information encoded in one AI program, you can export it
to another one.</a>

No, we don't.  The human brain deals with a constant data stream of tens
(maybe hundreds) of megabytes per second.  You remember only</a> a tiny fraction
<a name="0189qlink5">of that - maybe a few bytes per second if you're paying close attention,
otherwise even less.  An AI that can handle the same sensory data would be
able to store a much larger fraction of it, because its memory operates in
the same time scale as its CPU.</a>
