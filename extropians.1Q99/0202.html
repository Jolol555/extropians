<p>

<p>
<i>&gt;I'm not sure what you mean.  Yes, the conclusions of overly narrow </i><br>
<i>&gt;consequentialist analyses can be overcome by broader analyses, which </i><br>
<i>&gt;consider more actors, factors, or choices, or which look further in time.   </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Those who take this view in debates, however, should be prepared to engage</i><br>

<i>&gt;consequences, and to show in some detail how their consideration overturns</i><br>
<i>&gt;simpler analyses.  </i><br>

<p>
 I think most of the libertarians you are trying to criticise will admit
if pinned down carefully enough that their axioms are derived from
consequential analyses. At least they don't seem to have any competing
justification for their axioms.
<br>
 I think your main disagreement is that they misjudge what part of their
reasoning is being rejected - they typically assume without evidence that
most people understand the kind of arguments Epstein makes in his book
Simple Rules for a Complex World, when it isn't clear that even most
libertarians understand those arguments.
