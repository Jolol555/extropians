<a href="1516.html#1532qlink1">&gt; Unfortunately, this sort of improvement also tends to be self-limiting.  In</a><br>
<i>&gt; any given problem domain there comes a time when all of the known methods</i><br>
<i>&gt; for improving performance have been applied, and there are no more obvious</i><br>
<i>&gt; improvements that can be made.  Then you are reduced to inventing new</i><br>
<i>&gt; solutions, which is a process of scientific discovery that requires large</i><br>
<i>&gt; amounts of effort and produces only erratic results.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1556qlink1">I'd just like to remind everyone that this is an open issue.  My claim
has always been that, to our knowledge, this applies _only_ to a
constant intelligence - a constant intelligence, repeatedly examining
the same problem, _may_ eventually run out of steam.  Over a wider range
of history, a pattern of breakthroughs and bottlenecks is apparent -
running out of steam is only temporary, until a new stimulus breaks the
deadlock.  Again, this is for constant intelligence.</a>

<p>
<a name="1556qlink2">If the domain is the improving intelligence itself, the problem may
never arise.  Any increment in intelligence, achieved by applying the
current problem-solving methods, may give rise to new problem-solving
methods.  I can't know that for an AI trajectory, of course.  My
knowledge is limited to a short range around current levels of
intelligence, and the behavior exhibited here is that most major
bottlenecks yield to a very slight intelligence enhancement.  I assume,
for lack of a better-supported alternative, that this behavior is
universal along the trajectory.</a>

<p>
<a name="1556qlink3">Few here would care to speculate about ultimate limits that will apply
not merely to our first crude AIs but to the utmost efforts of galactic
civilizations a billion years hence.  What is any temporary bottleneck
on such a scale?  With time, and advancement, such things will crumble -
or so we believe.  But an intelligence enhancement is just as poisonous
to bottlenecks as a million years of plugging away.

<p>
Our history has trained us to find eternal bottlenecks absurd. 
Bottlenecks which somehow stand up to enhanced intelligence are just as silly.</a>
