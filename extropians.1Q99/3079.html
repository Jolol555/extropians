The hypocrisy that some were forced to serve while others (based

Way to go, Brian!  Correct on all counts.  It's time for the silent vets to
speak up and clear the air of the horseshit we've had to put up with then and
ever since.  Those of our generation who did their duty have gotten the
biggest shaft ever (I think).  I am so proud of all you guys who risked
everything for an ideal and have gotten nothing but shit ever since.

the American flag stood for.  I answered that it stood for the blood of the
brave men who died fighting for our freedom.

She acted horrified and said "I'll forgive you for that."

If she was a guy I would have been tempted to belt him, but all I could do was
walk away, seething, in polite silence.</a>

Go Navy!
