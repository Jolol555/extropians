The primary purpose is that it separates the individual who has demonstrated a
disregard for others rights from the society which respects those rights. We can
no longer deport these people to prison colonies, and they cannot flee to the
fronteirs or be forced into the army to serve on the fronteir, so they get put
into 'storage'.

<p>
Piers Anthony's _Ring_ novel is a good depiction of an alternative to
imprisonment. Convicts get a ring installed on their fingers that is embedded to
the bone. It monitors the convicts thoughts, giving varying levels of pain for
various thoughts and immobilizing pain when 'illegal' actions are taken. The
conundrum in the novel is that the rings are programmed by someone with a very
puritanical and severe idea of right and wrong, so there tends to be a very
severe period of adjustment that a convict goes through, and sometimes does not
survive.
