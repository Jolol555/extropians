Uh, which law, exactly, makes spam illegal, and in which countries? At the
moment various aspects of spam may or may not be illegal (e.g. fraudulent
forgery of email addresses, denial of service, etc), but not the actual
act of spamming.

Sounds about the level of intelligence of the Eurocrats; if you don't like
spam, cut all Europeans off from the rest of the Net. Geez.

<p>
And even if that proposal wasn't totally absurd, much of the spam I've
received in the last couple of months claims to come from Russia and
China...

Boy, I'm glad to see Extropians arguing for free-market solutions to
problems rather than calling in big brother every time someone annoys
them.

<p>
Look, as someone who's had to deal with asshole spammers sending out
literally millions of messages with a forged unicorn.com return
address, I have more reasons than most to support the death penalty for
spammers. But these kind of proposals are absurd authoritarian solutions
to a minor problem which will destroy most of our freedom on the Net in
order to potentially save a few minutes deleting garbage from our
mailboxes. 

<p>
Frankly, the worst problem the Net faces is not spam or web abuse, it's
the dumbocratic idiots jumping in to sacrifice out freedoms to their big
brother solutions to minor problems; as with the Slashdot folks arguing
to ban anonymity so they don't have to read so many flames.
