<p>
<a href="2114.html#2160qlink1">    &gt;The enormous bulk of this cost is for regulatory compliance and marketing</a><br>
</a><i>    &gt;Dithc the regulations and hte cost is minimal</i><br>

<p>
I hate the FDA as much as anyone but that is a huge exaggeration. The average
<a name="2174qlink2">non generic drug company spends more than twice as much on
research as a computer company of the same size.</a> FDA or no FDA, any big
<a name="2174qlink3">company that is not suicidal had better make damn sure that it's product
doesn't kill more people than it saves.</a>

<pre>
     &gt;Critically, you ignore the power of branding. If what you say was
     &gt;correct, Philip Morris would not be the 100 billion dollar company
     &gt;which it is. Nor would Coca Cola.

</pre>
<p>
<a name="2174qlink5">The minimal thing in the drug business is not research but manufacturing. If
Coca Cola cost 10$ a can and generic cola cost 10 cents a can then Coca Cola
would be dead as the dodo. Price disparities of that magnitude are possible in
the drug business.</a>

<p>
<a href="2114.html#2160qlink2">    &gt;In a non-patent &amp; non-FDA world, without having carried out product</a><br>
<i>    &gt;safety tests for themselves, any generic rip-offs would expose themselves</i><br>
<i>    &gt;to product liability.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2174qlink7">Why reinvent the wheel? If a reputable drug company conducts safety tests
there is no need to repeat them.</a> Besides, I can make this stuff in my garage,
<a name="2174qlink8">go ahead and sue me, you can't get blood out of a turnip.</a>

<p>
<a href="2114.html#2160qlink3">    &gt;Get rid of the FDA and the barrier to generics would raise substantially.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="2174qlink9">I'd love to dump the FDA, but I don't follow you here.</a>


<p>
     &gt;Well, many of us might argue that cheap drugs by the tonne is a good thing.

<p>
<a name="2174qlink11">I would argue that nothing but the same old drugs we've been using for 50
years is not a good thing, regardless of their price.</a>

<p>
<a name="2174qlink12"><a name="2169qlink2">     &gt;The Cisco chair simply believes that patents are not the way to do business.

<p>
<a name="2198qlink1">Even with all their patents I can't build a router as good as Cisco's and sell
it at 1% of their price.</a></a></a>
