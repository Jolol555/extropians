  IAN: Keep in mind that just because leaders say 
  X is a hoax does not mean that X is a hoax. To 
  know if X is a hoax requires more than faith
  in authorities, hard to imagine as that may be. 

<p>
  We can know, for example, that the web page you 
  forwarded commits a hoax because it presented no
  evidence of a hoax it purports to exist. It even 
  notes that the source of Salinger's document was 
  Richard Russell, a retired United Airlines pilot 
  living in Florida. That is not evidence that it 
  was a hoax. The proof that it was not a hoax is 
  the fact that Richard Russell was not making it 
  up. He acquired the FAA radar tape from the same
  person connected to the investigation he acquired 
  the intelligence of the Navy activities under FL800.

<p>
  That the Russell report is a hoax is a proven hoax.
