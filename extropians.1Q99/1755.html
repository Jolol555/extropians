  IAN: Or "greater good." Right I agree with your 
  points. Even the Nazis' had the SS, and evidence
  suggests that Special Forces in the U.S. have SS- 
  type subgroups of elite terrorists, these are 
  the types that are used in help regimes in 
  other countries torture political opponents...

<p>
  The rank-and-file National Guard will be a different
  lot, and no doubt many would even resist shooting 
  citizens. But hoping that that would prevent such
  an operation from reaching its objectives is not
  likely. SS-type groups are designed to weed out 
  "trouble makers" (ethical people) in the military.

<a href="1734.html#1755qlink5">&gt;&gt;   Do people think that in Nazi Germany there</a><br>

  IAN: Yes, but the majority is bought and sold on 
  mainstream media, i.e. Federal PR Office, disinfo.
  It seems to me that they'll let "weeds" like me grow
  in the information garden, but if you get in with 
  a person respected by the majority, like Pierre
  Salinger, then they apply weed-killing measuring
  with heavy applications of poisonous falsehoods.
  Controlling the majority mind is their objective.
