<p>
 SCAM ALERT!<a name="1075qlink1"> WARNING! PLEASE READ IMMEDIATELY!

<p>
             THIS IS SERIOUS!!!

<p>
If you get an envelope from a company called the
"Internal Revenue Service," DO NOT OPEN IT!

<p>
This group operates a scam around this time every year.
Their letter claims that you owe them money, which they
will take and use to pay for the operation of essential
functions of the United States government. This is untrue!
The money the IRS collects is used to fund various
</a>inefficient and pointless social engineering projects.

<p>
This organization has ties to another shady outfit called
the Social Security Administration, who claim to take money
from your regular paychecks and save it for your retirement.
In truth, the SSA uses the money to pay for the same
misguided make-work projects the IRS helps mastermind.
These scam artists have bilked honest, hard working Americans
out of billions of dollars. Don't be among them!

<p>
Please copy this envelope in triplicate according to the
guidelines of the "Paperwork Augmentation Act" of 1999
and then tear up all three of these envelopes a
hundred pieces and send the pieces to the following address:


<p>
 IRS, "FORM 1040 - NOT EZ"  - Rejected Refunds Division
 Office 1600, Room 412, Cubicle 13, Desk 7, Filing Cabinet 6,
 Drawer 3, Space 62, Folder 5
<br>
 Washington, DC  20000-0000
