Government regulatory bodies are created, staffed, and informed by groups of
people with a profoundly stasist world-view.  Most of them really don't
understand that the world is a dynamic place, despite the constant change
that surrounds them.  They see each individual change as some unique event
unconnected to the others (or worse, as part of an Evil Conspiracy to
destroy everything good in the world).

<p>
Such people don't plan for change, because they don't want it to happen.
They want to make everything fit their particular vision of how things
should be, so they craft static laws intended to change a set present into
their desired form of stasis.  They see the whole project as a one-time
transition, so it seldom occurs to them to worry about whether their rules
will continue to work as the world changes around them.
