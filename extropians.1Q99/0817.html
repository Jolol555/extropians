The "Sugar Cube" That Remembers...



<p>
   Last issue we talked about how nanotechnology may, eventually,
   enable us to store "...a hundred billion billion bytes in a volume
   the size of a sugar cube"
<br>
   (<a href="http://www.digital.com/rcfoc/981221.htm#A_Hundred_Billion_Billion">http://www.digital.com/rcfoc/981221.htm#A_Hundred_Billion_Billion</a>).
   But of course that's off in the far future. So how about a mere "100
   trillion bits of data in a cubic centimeter of space?"

<p>
   Brought to our attention by RCFoC reader Alan Maltzman from the Dec.
   15 Nikkei English News, it seems that Japan Science and Technology
   Corp. and Kyoto University's Hirao Active Glass Project is pursuing
   an optical storage device that will use femtosecond lasers (pulsing
   a thousand-trillion times each second) to store a hundred terabits
   of data in that tiny volume.</a>

<p>
   They begin with today's optical storage technique of using a laser
   to burn pits in a surface. But they combine this with the laser's
   ability to alter the state of a rare earth element called
   "samarium," mixed into this glass storage medium, in a special way.
   Rather than burning a simple "on or off" pit, the samarium can be
   altered to only "burn out" certain "colors" from each spot, thereby
   allowing each spot to take on one of many different values (rather
   than only a 1 or 0).

<p>
   This is only "basic research" at this time. But it is a good
   reminder that it may not take the seemingly far-out technology
   breakthroughs of nanotechnology to make potentially vast differences
   in how we compute -- shorter-term innovation might allow us to store
   a year of Digital TV content in a glass sugar cube. Just don't drop
   it in your cup of coffee...
