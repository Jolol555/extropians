  I have just started a similar discussion group for the
Usenet filtering project - see "newsfilter" list on
www.onelist.com

<p>
The idea was to create a set of open standards for storage
and transmission of semantic encodings for certain services,
and the first implementation of major architectural components.
This should create an infrastructure that should allow further
rapid development and value-added third party services.
Consider HTML-HTTP-Browser-Spider-Search engine combo for the Web.
After you have the first version of all, further development
of individual services and add-ons becomes possible.
So far, all semantic analysis has been done by humans. Now, build
another level of standards for representing (XML/MCF/...),
processing, and targeting documents based on their semantic
encoding, and you have something new - in fact, you will have
an environment that should hopefully make development of
symbolic AI as profitable an occupation for third-party
services as text retrieval became with the invention of
simple document-storage systems.

<p>
I suggested some ideas and perspective technologies in this
direction in

<p>
If anybody is interested in working on such a system,
we should definitely start a project mailing list.
Please email me personally, and we can discuss this further.
