 I buy this. This sounds like a great future, well worth striving
 for. The danger is thinking it is inevitable - if we do that, then we
 think that we don't need to do much, and eventually nothing gets
 done. But if we see it as a goal, something noble to strive for (in
 its many varieties) in a rational manner, then we have a chance of
 getting there.
 
<p>
Important point Anders.  It is worth striving for and we do have a chance of
getting there.  You have a much better chance of getting to where you want to
be if you aim for it.  It is the main reason I've founded a church, to
institutionalize this directed striving.  I have children and grandchildren
who's well being in the future greatly concerns me.

<p>

<p>
 This is the part I don't buy. Note that you assume time travel, which
 is a rather big assumption, and also that God will exist in this way,
 which is another big assumption. It would be nice if it was true, but
 there are no particular reasons to think that these assumptions hold
 true.
 
<p>
Thanks Anders.  This scenario fails when time travel is proven impossible.  I
see this as a fifty fifty proposition, but still worth striving for.
Regarding the nature of God... I think this is up to us.  He will be how we
make him to be, for good or for bad.  I want to make sure He's good, another
reason to institutionalize these aspirations.

<p>
<a href="2269.html#2349qlink3"> &gt; In fact. I believe God expects us to join the community of gods that is</a><br>

<p>
 Well, Tipler did manage to show some interesting limitations on
 posthuman omniintelligences (or whatever to call the things that are
 SI to SIs), and without an OP they will still be finite - immense, but
 with a finite lifetime, computational ability and memory. On the other
 hand, if you allow time travel you can likely do tricks that make the
 Bekenstein bound break... but it is a big assumption to make. 

<p>
Anders, I think this assumption is still worth making.  I like the results.

 Ah, The Church of the Fixed Point: our reality and human nature is the
 only consistent fixed point for the above process. The Church spends
 lots of time iterating immense dynamical systems on the holy computers
 trying to calculate the parameters of love, truth and sacredness. They
 have already found truth to two decimal places...
 
<p>
 :-)

<p>
Ha Ha.  The Strong Anthropic Principle taken to the absurd.  None-the-less,
worth striving for.

<p>
Hoping not to bore you, let me tell you a little about myself and how this
goal of mine came to obsess me.

<p>
I am a 54 year old businessman and Viet Nam era vet (sorry, Viet Nam is how it
was spelled there).  I am not a scientist like most of you guys.  Long ago, I
studied Materials Science for three years at MIT but never finished it.  

<p>
I am trying to make my third marriage work and have a son (31) and daughter
(4) who I adore.

<p>
My body has been insulted by a tumor on my brain and diabetes.  My spirit was
shattered by the death of my father 6 years ago.

<p>
Must life be so painful for us?  Must their be no recognition for the
existential heros we all must be to function throughout a normal lifetime?  Is
there no reward for being a dutiful soldier?

<p>
Maybe I'm crazy, but I think a well designed modern, scientifically grounded
religion should and must minister to these needs, for everyone!!  Who else
will?

<p>
