One might wish to avoid killing random less powerful entities if one
finds them worth avoid killing for some reason.  As a matter of fact,
one would only kill them if one had a rational reason to do so.  This

by killing off them if they disturb me.  If they do, I could simply
remove them from the premises.

<a name="0589qlink5">My wiring makes me wish to increase my knowledge of the world.  A greater
number of species and individuals in the world allows for more complexity
and thus makes the world more interesting to me.  This would indicate to
me that I should avoid killing off less powerful entities, since I find
pleasure in increasing my knowledge of the world, and their evolution to
a higher power would make them and/or their species more interesting later.

If you lack this incentive your mileage may vary, naturally.
