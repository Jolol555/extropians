<a name="2612qlink1">Doesn't exactly explain the situation during the stone age. Why bury
flowers with the dead? Did somebody sell them?</a> Atheists cannot get
lynched if there is no strong urge to worship. A slightly more
believable explanation would be that cult leaders have a lot of
children, but that would suggest that cult leaders in general have
worship-inducing genes, while in reality they more often tend to be of
the sociopath phenotype (i.e opportunists exploiting an opportunity
unhampered by storng feelings of empathy). No, I don't buy that
explanation.

<p>
<a href="2494.html#2596qlink2">&gt; That got started when some ur-theology (argued on grounds of strict</a><br>
<i>&gt; what-passed-for-rationality) became a political issue.  You don't need</i><br>
<i>&gt; faith for that to happen (it was a long time before Occam's Razor), you</i><br>
<i>&gt; just need political instincts.</i><br>

<p>
Why would all this ur-theology involve worship? Why did not the view
of the world "it is all natural, let's enjoy it" have any advantage?

<p>
<a href="2494.html#2596qlink3">&gt; &gt; As I see it, we need to find ways of making extropianism or</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; transhumanism as emotionally fulfilling as it is intellectually</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; fulfilling. I think it can be done, but it is an unusual (i.e. new)</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; use for psychology and critical thinking to come up with it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think you can do that without losing the truth.  A meme</i><br>
<i>&gt; optimized for rationality cannot compete on grounds of emotional</i><br>
<i>&gt; fulfillment.  Besides, believing something because it's warm n' fuzzy is</i><br>
<i>&gt; itself irrational.</i><br>

<p>
I'm not saying we should change the transhumanist meme, I'm saying we
should change (say) our meeting places (softer light on the list?
background music :-), build supporting memes with positive emotional
content (like transhumanist art) and foremost, learn to enjoy being
rational.
