<a name="3097qlink1"><a name="3091qlink1"><a name="3089qlink1">From: Jeff Davis &lt;jdavis@socketscience.com&gt;

<p>
<a href="3017.html#3077qlink1">&gt; What the modern reader will also be unaware of is that joining</a><br>
</a>
<i>&</a>gt;the navy at that time was an act of pragmatism bordering almost on</i><br>
<i>&gt;cowardice.  Almost, but not quite.</i><br>

<p>
Why don't you try telling that to Admiral James Stockdale, who was
tortured for 10+ years as a POW. Or any of the rest.
</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;  You see, back then, anyone of military age who wasn't a</i><br>
<a href="3053.html#3077qlink2">&gt;complete idiot was concerned about their personal safety.  You</a><br>
<i>&gt;could get killed in that damn war.  But, if you joined the navy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;you avoided the draft, and with it the army, and the possibility</i><br>
<i>&gt;of combat.  You got to have your cake, and eat it too: the</i><br>
<i>&gt;recognition of honorable service to your country in its time of</i><br>
<i>&gt;need, with an absolute guarantee that your butt would never be on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the line (as in "battle" line).  Army, Air Force, and Marines were</i><br>
<i>&gt;all stationed on Vietnamese soil.  Only those in the Navy were</i><br>
<i>&gt;not, with only a few exceptions.  So no one back then thought that</i><br>
<i>&gt;joining the navy was a cowardly thing to do, they thought it was</i><br>
<i>&gt;a smart thing to do, damn smart.  Many's the draftee who wished he</i><br>
<i>&gt;had figured that out _before_ he got drafted.</i><br>

<p>
You couldn't just walk in an join the Navy. They had a limited
number of slots and the rich and powerful made sure they were
reserved for their own kind.

<p>
Of course if you really had power you either joined the national
guard  (Dan Quayle) or limped along on college deferment. (Bill
Clinton)


<p>
<a href="3017.html#3077qlink3">&gt; Yes they did.  They were boys out of high school, raised on John</a><br>
<i>&gt;Wayne movies and rabid anti-communism, who wanted a war like dad</i><br>
<i>&gt;had in WW2, and their uncles in Korea.  A war like on tv where men</i><br>
<i>&gt;died with heroic grace, where the enemy was an evil sub-human who</i><br>
<i>&gt;deserved to die, and who did so with cinematic convenience.  These</i><br>
<i>&gt;were boys who were charged up with testosterone and anxious to</i><br>
<i>&gt;prove their manhood and their patriotism.  They would fight,...and</i><br>
<i>&gt;kill...and die...for the country they loved and which, they</i><br>
<i>&gt;believed, could do no wrong.  They knew nothing about justice,</i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing about war, nothing about history, and less than nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt;about Vietnam.  In short, they were clueless.  </i><br>

<p>
Now you're an expert on everyone who went. We may have been raised
on John Wayne movies (people die in John Wayne movies), but most of
the people who I know served weren't anxious to go, they did feel
it was right, and a duty they owed to country.

<p>
<a href="3017.html#3077qlink4">&gt; An examination of the facts clearly shows that the US involvement</a><br>
<i>&gt;in Vietnam was a wholly criminal affair.  Those who believed or</i><br>
<i>&gt;believe otherwise are, to be blunt, wrong.  As in two plus two</i><br>
<i>&gt;equals anything but four.  Wrong. </i><br>
        
<p>
Yes we're all wrong, you're the only one right......


<p>
<a href="3017.html#3077qlink5">&gt; No one who went through that period, and who learned ANYTHING,</a><br>
<i>&gt;could repeat the above infantile cliche horseshit.  This is "I</i><br>
<i>&gt;wanna be a hero just like dad."   </i><br>

<p>
What is infantile is trying to speak for others.


<p>
<a name="3097qlink2"><a href="3017.html#3077qlink6">&gt; And this, this is the worst.  No, no it's not.  Two MILLION</a><br>
<i>&gt;Vietnamese murdered; 58,000 clueless American boys murdered. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Heroes all.  Killed for profit, for the vanity of power, for</i><br>
<i>&gt;bigotry, and for stupidity; that's worse.</i><br>

<p>
Those who served honorably are heroes, on this we agree. You might
also be surprised to learn that I agree that Vietnam was a bad
idea. Even though I enlisted at the time.</a>
  
<p>
<a name="3097qlink3"><a href="3017.html#3077qlink7">&gt; The people who, for various reasons, protested this crime, who</a><br>
<i>&gt;understood about injustice and war, and who tried to stop it, were</i><br>
<i>&gt;heroes as well; but more to the point, they were regular people</i><br>
<i>&gt;who retained the ability to distinguish right from wrong, and who</i><br>
<i>&gt;had the courage to act on this knowledge, at a time when cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt;influences worked almost overwhelmingly against them. </i><br>

<p>
Nonsense, Jane Fonda is a traitor, not a hero. Those who opposed
the war on sincere moral grounds and acted accordingly also have my
respect.</a>


<p>
<a href="3017.html#3077qlink8">&gt; In June of 68 I notified my draft board that I was ready to go. </a><br>
<i>&gt;Stupid. They drafted me, and I served in the army from Sep 68 to</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jun 70.  But I got lucky and did not go to Vietnam.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;I was near clueless back then, as so many of us were.  We ALL</i><br>
<i>&gt;learned something.  Some more than others. Getting at the truth,</i><br>
<i>&gt;especially about the history of "difficult" times,</i><br>
<i>&gt;can be tough.  You will not learn it in school, or find it in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;mainstream press.  But it can be done.  If you want the truth</i><br>
<i>&gt;about Vietnam, read Chomsky.</i><br>

<p>
It seems it was you who did not act according to your convictions.

<p>
I am not interested in Chomsky's opinion of the Vietnam War.


<p>
<a href="3017.html#3077qlink9">&gt; I wrote this because I wanted readers like Randall Randall and</a><br>
<i>&gt;Harvey Newstrom, who stated that they were too young to experience</i><br>
<i>&gt;these events first hand, to have a chance at the truth.  </i><br>

<p>
You wrote this to express your own opinions, nothing more.

<p>
<a name="3078qlink1">Someone asked about extropian relevance. I feel it has to do with
personnel responsibility. I enlisted because that is what I felt
was right. I have always opposed the draft and cannot figure out
how it can exist in a so-called democracy.</a>

<p>
The hypocrisy that some were forced to serve while others (based
mostly on economics) were given a pass is something that should
never again be permitted.

<p>
Semper Fi.
