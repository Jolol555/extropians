<a href="1467.html#1557qlink1">&gt;The meeting will be organized as a "DesignShop" at knOwhere Palo Alto.</a><br>
<i>&gt;The DesignShop is some sort of collaborative brainstorming methodology,</i><br>

<i>&gt;as needed.  The web materials on this system (linked from the URL above)</i><br>

 I've read it. They put together a lot of little psychological cues to
create the right moods for groups of people to solve problems that have
been bothering them. It's primarily oriented towards helping large companies
make important policy decisions. It isn't obvious why it works, but the
testimonials sound impressive.

 It isn't obvious that Foresight senior associates will come with enough
agreement about what problems they are trying to solve for these techniques
to be effective. How to build an assembler or how to prevent gray goo are
overly ambitious for that kind of meeting. How to change the focus of
CritSuite to make it more popular would be the kind of problem that would
be more appropriate, but there will be lots of people there who aren't
interested in that subject.
