Forbes does have many attractive views, especially in the economic realm.

<p>
Where most of us will have problems are the social issues.  See
<a href="http://www.Forbes2000.com/compass/complete_text.html">http://www.Forbes2000.com/compass/complete_text.html</a>.  Forbes appears to
be wedded to conventional religious morality.  He opposes abortion and
wants to work to make it illegal.  He sees Clinton as having abandoned
the war on drugs and wants to increase crackdowns.  He opposes assisted
suicide and views it as a step towards euthanasia

<p>
In some ways I am not too terribly concerned about these issues, because
these are largely old disputes which have battled to a standstill.
No new President is going to be able to push things much one way or the
other, whether his views are those I would support or oppose.

<p>
My larger concern is the new issues we will face over the next decade,
particularly in the biotech field.  Forbes is going to be looking at
these new technologies through the prism of the Bible.  As President
he would be providing leadership on new and unfamiliar problems, and
could be greatly influential.  How is he going to react to cloning,
or other new fertility technologies?  How about genetic modification of
unborn children?  How about pre-death cryonic suspension, or meddling in
the natural lifespan?  I am concerned that he would take a reactionary
position to all such issues, and oppose anything which is a significant
change from the natural lifestyle ordained by God.

<p>
Forbes is not exactly a front runner.  Most of the smart money for the
Republican nomination is backing Bush, with Elizabeth Dole making a push
probably to be a vice presidential candidate.  Obviously there is still
considerable uncertainty, and particularly if Y2K is nasty then Forbes
may be able to position himself as a technocrat who can clean up the mess.
But otherwise, his chances are slim.

<p>
If you're going to support a candidate who is so unlikely to win, you
might do better to find one whose views you can support wholeheartedly,
someone who doesn't hold positions that you hate.  Presumably there are
or will be a number of minor party candidates who will be more attractive
than Forbes.

<p>
It is true that many of Forbes' ideas are relatively good for someone
who is so visible.  If he emphasizes the economic side, he could help
pull the other candidates towards positions I support.  It may be worth
backing him for this reason, even if his own chances don't look strong.
I would want to wait and see how he balances his emphasis between his
economic and moral/religious views.
