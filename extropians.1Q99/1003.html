  The ordering of individuals in a system
  creates a de facto collective entity, be
  that entity real or an illusion. The main
  actor in Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations"
  was in fact a collective entity that's
  widely know as "the invisible hand."

<p>
<a name="1014qlink1">"Collective entity" seems to involve a contradiction, since</a> a collection of<br>
<a name="1014qlink2">objects can't itself be a physical object, it exists solely as a concept.</a></a>
<a name="1009qlink2">But I suspect we're once again embroiled in more a semantic than a
substantive disagreement here. It all hinges on your definition of
<br>
"entity". To me an entity is a "thing", a physical existent that can be<br>
perceived via the senses (or extensions of the senses). Apparently you wish
<a name="1014qlink3">to include concepts such as sets, relations and systems under the
definition of "entity". But this usage generates confusion, since</a> there are
<a name="1014qlink4">obvious basic differences between physical things on the one hand and
arrangements of things on the other, and grave errors ensue from</a> failing to
<a name="1014qlink5">distinguish different categories.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="1014qlink6"><a name="1009qlink3">Smith's famous invisible hand - virtually synonymous with the extropian
principle of spontaneous organisation - is the internal organizing
principle of a complex relational nexus.</a> It is not by any stretch of the
</a>
imagination a "thing". As evidence that Smith himself had no illusions
about it being an entity in the strict sense, observe that he used the
phrase in a simile ("...as if by an invisible hand") and not as a metaphor
as in common usage nowadays.
