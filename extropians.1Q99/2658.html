Jonathan, I once managed to accidentally make my dog superstitious and
even
<br>
perform a worship service of me.  I always gave him only dry dog food,
and not
<br>
too much of even that.  One day, just for the hell of it, I cooked two
steaks and
<br>
gave him one.  Right when I walked out with the steak, he happened to be
rolling
<br>
in the grass on his back.  For several days after, whenever I came out
of the
<br>
house, he would immediately roll on his back and start worshipping.
{8^D
<br>
Oh mighty human, accept my humble canine supplication...

<p>
He was a good dog.  Shoulda had him frozen.

Perhaps you are right.  I can imagine a group of cave humans,
superstitious and
<br>
afraid of everything, for good reason.  One day when there was a wicked
thunderstorm, as they cowered in the back of the cave, one gutsy guy
stood
<br>
in the opening.  Whenever a big flash happened, he would spread his arms
wide,
<br>
and right away a boom!  After that, noooo one messed with that guy.
Power!
<br>
Had all the ladies he wanted, many offspring.  And no wonder he wanted
to
<br>
propagate the god gene.  He was in tight with god!

<p>
When you think it over, it really is no wonder that every human society
has
<br>
the god(s) meme.  There are plenty of mechanisms that would start and
propagate it, whereas those mechanisms that overturn it are few and
sophisticated, such as logic and reason, forces which in human society
are
<br>
fragile indeed.  spike
