  IAN: Mike, in light of the fact that you were only 
  able to support the CIA's explanation of eyewitness 
  accounts with false claims about the content of the 
  CIA video, your implying that my case suffers an 
  evidence shortfall is pretty funny... or is it sad?

<p>
  As per your comparing Waco and FL800: your faith 
  in the FBI -- the gang that committed premeditated 
  mass murder in Waco (as revealed in the Govt's own 
  FLIR video) -- is oddly strong in the FL800 case, 
  where the FBI currently conceals the identities 
  of Navy vessels under the Privacy Act, and has 
  both lost and continues to conceal most of the 
  physical evidence and data, including witness 
  accounts of a rocket rising from the surface. 

<p>
(a recent Village Voice article covers a few examples:
<a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/features/9908/davey.shtml">http://www.villagevoice.com/features/9908/davey.shtml</a>)

<p>
  Who could trust the mass murders of Waco as they 
  conceal evidence in yet another case with over 100
  witnesses clearly describing a surface-to-air antiaircraft
   engagement sourced to the very area that 
  FBI agent James Kallstrom admits there were "Navy 
  vessels that were on classified maneuvers"? I sure 
  can't. (<a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/irvine.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/irvine.htm</a>)

<p>
  Eyewitnesses, including Navy vets, also saw Navy 
  ships in that area (here's the account of 2 Navyship
   witnesses: <a href="http://twa800.com/perry.htm">http://twa800.com/perry.htm</a>).
  Here are two eyewitness accounts of the upward- 
  shooting flare given within a day of the crash. 
  On the PBS NewsHour (7/18/96), Cecelia Penney said:

<p>
"Well, we were sitting on my father-in-law's boat, 
and all of a sudden my husband pointed to the sky 
and said, "Look! Somebody shot up a flare." And we 
all looked up, and a couple of seconds later, we 
just saw this burst of flames, and it separated." 

<p>

<p>
  Here's the eyewitness account of Tom Kennedy 
  from ABC News Nightline given less than three
  hours after the crash (7/17/96) of Flight 800:
  
<p>
"And I was pulling my boat back in and I was tying 
it up and the guy next to me was tying his up and 
we were just talking and the guy said, "Hay look 
at that flare," and I turned around and looked at 
the flare, and I'm like "Wow, someone must have had 
some trouble in the bay," and no sooner had I said 
that than the thing just exploded and it looked like 
a Christmas tree of fire going down to the water."  

<p>
(see: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/forgot01.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/forgot01.htm</a>) 

<p>
   That the "flare" he saw was rising up 
   is clearly indicated by the association 
   of its source with someone "in the bay."
   In the first case, the witness's husband
   said "Look! Somebody shot up a flare."
