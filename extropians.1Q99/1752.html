the mark (unfortunately!).<a name="1771qlink2"> The government systems that give away our money
are the *most* advanced in terms of being fixed.</a>

<p>

<i>&gt;government can shut down the banks to stop them, but that will make</i><br>

<p>

the Fed can handle even that, so long as it doesn't all happen in a day. If

<p>
<a href="1733.html#1752qlink3">&gt;4. Stock market collapse: this is pretty much inevitable late this</a><br>
<i>&gt;year. How low it will go is another question, but I don't think the</i><br>
<i>&gt;bottom will completely drop out of the market because many will take</i><br>
<i>&gt;advantage of the situation to buy up shares at low, low prices.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1771qlink5">Again, this seems to be a general assumption. The belief may be

<a name="1771qlink7">(and perhaps Europe to a lesser extent), the *opposite* may happen. If
you're in a country that has done almost nothing to address the Y2K
problem, where would you want to put your money.</a> It seems possible that the
US stock market or money market funds will see an increased influx from
overseas. This might either damp any dip caused by US investors, or
<a name="2033qlink2">actually cause a rise. Either way, I think it's impossible to time market
drops and rises. If you're a long-term investor it makes sense to ride</a> it
through.


<p>
<a href="1733.html#1752qlink4">&gt;5. Foreign problems: most of this message is about the US, Canada and</a><br>
<i>&gt;Europe; outside of those areas, well, Russia is doomed, Japan is</i><br>
<i>&gt;doomed, China is in big trouble, and so are many other Asian countries.</i><br>

<p>
I agree that the Y2K threat is much more of an issue for Asian countries
and South America. Venezuela only officially started action a couple of
months ago. But then I'm not clear how many of these countries systems are
old enough to have the problem.

<p>
<a name="2033qlink3"><a href="1733.html#1752qlink5">&gt;I won't even mention oil; the Middle East is almost as doomed as Asia.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="1771qlink8">Any information to back up this claim?</a> I would think they could afford to
<a name="1771qlink9">update their systems, though that doesn't mean they have.</a>
</a>

<p>
<a href="1733.html#1752qlink6">&gt;6. War: with many US military systems out of action and most of the US</a><br>
<i>&gt;armed forces trying to keep 'order' at home, North Korea, Iraq and other</i><br>
<i>&gt;coutries will take advantage of it to settle old scores. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="1771qlink10">Out of action? What evidence do you have</a> for that? I'm not saying you're
wrong, but I haven't seen much reason to agree. I only recall tests that
show important systems will work. Since I don't see major problems in the
US, the military will not be busy here. 

<p>
<a name="1785qlink1">If we can agree on some specific claim about unrest in the US and some of
these other points, I'm willing to bet money against the doomsayer view.</a>

<p>
<a href="1733.html#1752qlink7">&gt;7. Civil war: given the general level of chaos, various groups</a><br>
<i>&gt;are going to take advantage of it to settle old scores; I wouldn't want</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be in DC in Jan 2000. If martial law lasts too long it will turn into </i><br>
<i>&gt;a civil war in the US and possibly the more extreme European states.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1771qlink11">Please, please, please, make me a specific enough claim about civil way in
the US, and I'll take a bet against!</a>

<p>
<a href="1733.html#1752qlink8">&gt;8. Big business collapse: at least a few big organisations are going to</a><br>
<i>&gt;collapse, either because they're just broken or they're no longer able</i><br>
<i>&gt;to make enough money producing non-essential items to survive. Hundreds</i><br>
<i>&gt;of thousands or millions of new unemployed will just add to the general</i><br>
<i>&gt;problems.</i><br>

<p>
I'll also take a bet against your view that millions will become
unemployed. We would need to agree on a number of increased unemployed and
over what period. I think there will be little or no effect on unemployment.
