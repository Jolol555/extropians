Mr. Lorrey invoked the Laws of Land Warfare in his post.  I was merely
pointing out that his understanding of them was lacking.  I did not mean
to imply any sort of moral or ethical judgement, just a narrow legalism in
his chosen arguement.  Perhaps I should have put "legitimate insurgency"
in quotes.

Nevertheless, McVeigh deserves to hang.
