<a name="1052qlink1">You are correct in that I didn't run the numbers. I'm simply assuming that
I can find 2 million comets with an aggregate mass of two eath masses, and
that if I am willing to use fusion-powered ion engines, I can expend half
the mass of each comet to direct the other half into the same converging
hyperbolic orbit with very low relative velocities. Since each</a> of the million
<a name="1052qlink2">mass drivers is "small", far away, and directing its energy away</a> from earth,
<a name="1052qlink3">I assumed that detection from earth was difficult. As it happens, there
are a few minor trivial loose ends on this hare-brained scheme.</a> In particular
<a name="1052qlink4">I'm not quite sure how to manage the heat generated</a> as the pieces aggregate
<a name="1052qlink5">into a single mass.</a>

<a name="1052qlink6">Please note that I don't feel that this is the easiest way to use nanotech
to destroy a human-based civilization. I feel that direct application of
military nanotech gives an overwhelming advantage to the attacker. My
earth-mass impactor simply makes the attacker's advantage more obvious.</a>

<p>
<a name="1052qlink7">Just for fun, let's try an earth-based approach. I think your nano-based
defense model pits the defending naites against the attackers directly?
That is, you need to know that an attack is occurring.
What if I use my attackers to build hundreds or thousands of mega-nukes
at an appropriate depth in the earth's crust? I don't have to burrow the
nukes, I just program the seed nanites to first burrow and then</a> build nukes.
<a name="1052qlink8">You cannot defend against this unless you are continuously monitoring the
entire target volume: IMO this defense will require an SI.
