<p>
<a name="2428qlink2">I wonder what<a name="2421qlink1"> it is. The genetic explanation is simplistic and simply
skirts the issue:<a name="2494qlink1"> what systems in our brains produce an urge to
worship, and why?</a> I can't see any obvious evolutionary benefit from
</a>
<a name="2421qlink2">worshipping, so it might be a secondary consequence of other
</a>
features.</a> For example, our ability to draw analogies and generalize,
combined with our mammalian dependency on parents, might cause people
to create the idea of a "being that is to my parents as they are to
me" with the acompanying emotional and social implications. But this
is pure speculation.<a name="2428qlink3"> What real evidence is there for an innate
</a>
tendency for worship?

<a name="2428qlink4"><a href="2366.html#2400qlink2">&gt; Even now, I feel a vacuum in my life that extropianism does not fill</a><br>

<p>
<a name="2494qlink2"><a name="2421qlink3">As I see it, we need to find ways of making extropianism or
transhumanism as emotionally fulfilling as it is intellectually
fulfilling. I think it can be done, but it is an unusual (i.e. new)
use for psychology and critical thinking to come up</a> with it.
