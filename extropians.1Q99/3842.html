<a name="3845qlink1">Perhaps the real issue is that the current mode of education</a> is just barely
effectual. I personally failed in the public education system as an early
study of hyperactive or 'ADD' children. I was had a powerful sense of
curiosity and found myself bored to tears in conventional American public
schools. Eventually, I was fortunate enough to enroll in a private school
who had a radically different, scalable approach to education. I learned at
my own pace and with topics I excelled at, I was allowed to move swiftly
through them. I went from being a c-f graded student to a 'straight a'
student. Also, we were encouraged to explore unusual topics such as
Philosophy, which for a curious 5th grader was absolutely fascinating.


<p>
I personally agree that the current educational systems of the world are
largely failing to work efficiently. I'd say that my American educational
system is suffering a legacy of buraucracy but perhaps suffers due to
practical issues like budgets and staffing.

<p>
<a name="3845qlink2">I've noticed that the evolution of education has been severely inhibited.</a> Is
<a name="3845qlink3">this a subversive maneuver to preserve the economic class structures?</a>

<p>
<a name="3845qlink4">A poorly educated nation is easiest to govern. Perhaps that is why</a> so little
<a name="3845qlink5">is spent educating our people. (in the USA)</a>

<a href="3841.html#3842qlink2">&gt;&gt;It seems too me that one of the basic skills that people learn in school</a><br>
<i>&gt; is:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;how to learn. Assuming that this is a genetic trait, what if the child</i><br>
<i>&gt; never</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;wants to learn to read because playing outside with friends is more fun?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;There are windows of opportunity to learn certain types of skills when you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;are young that increasingly become difficult with age. e.g. learning a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;lanuage. I think the window is between 0-7 years. During this time, isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; it</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;easier to learn one or more lanuages?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; First off, if a child does not wish to learn to read, then forcing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject on him will only cause him harm, and will certainly not teach him to</i><br>
<i>&gt; enjoy reading. I do believe it is easier to learn to read up until a certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; age, and I'll accept your age of 7 for the sake of discussion, because I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't have more accurate information. It is my belief, and I think the</i><br>
<i>&gt; success of SVS shows, that if children want to learn, and if they have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; read to learn, that they will want to learn to read. But they have to decide</i><br>
<i>&gt; when. I was reading at age 3-4, not because of school but because my parents</i><br>
<i>&gt; read to me and I wanted to learn it. My husband, who is more intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; than I am, learned to read between the ages of 6-7. He just wasn't ready</i><br>
<i>&gt; before then. But when he was ready, he did it, and he did it because he</i><br>
<i>&gt; wanted to.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What you say about languages is also true -- it is far easier to learn them</i><br>
<i>&gt; at a young age. But once again, how does this typically come into practice?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not by them being taken to classes at age 3 to learn to speak French. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; happens by living in a multilingual household or by spending time in foreign</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries during these developmental years. Personally, I highly recommend</i><br>
<i>&gt; this and intend to do it with my own children when I have them.</i><br>
