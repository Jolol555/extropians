Sometime soon the on-line U.S. Code archives will delete the 
horrific law that was Section 1520 of U.S.C. Title 50, since
it was repealed. That law allowed for the testing of chemical
and biological agents on entire "civilian populations."  The 
law was in effect in the U.S. for 20 years (enacted in 1977 
as Public Law 95-79 and then repealed in 1997) and is PROOF 
that turning entire "civilian populations" into Guinea pig
farms was considered. One is forced to wonder if over that 
time the military abstained from that which the law defined.

<p>
Here then is that law. Save this short law. Any government
what would enact it could just as easily repeal it with a lie.
