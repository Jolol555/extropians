I know.  :(

The important people in this equation are the mid-level officers.
Battallion and division-level COs are a lot more prone to independent
thinking than individual riflemen, and a lot more likely to worry about this
kind of consideration.  Even then they'll probably let a lot of things
slide - but if you tell them to lock up the local government and disarm the
police, they aren't going to do it.
