<i>&gt; &gt; this is the critical statement on the whole site.  my task, before</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; comment means.  if it means an empty roton is 5% heavier than</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; an empty atlas, while holding 24% more fuel by mass (the only</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; logical interpretation of the statement) well, then im impressed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; i grant that it is possible, since a kerosene tank is much smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and lighter than a tank that could hold an equal mass of liquid</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hydrogen.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Atlas did not use liquid hydrogen...it was Kerosene/Lox like the Roton is.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Roton saves empty mass by widespread use of advanced composites instead</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the stainless steel the Atlas body/tank was made of.  And Roton stock</i><br>
<i>&gt; is not available to the public (unless you have several hundred thousand</i><br>
<i>&gt; you want to invest to make it worth their while to push it through the</i><br>
<i>&gt; SEC).  I think there may be an IPO after testing.</i><br>

<p>
Actually, you don't need to invest that much, you just have to have a minimum
net worth to qualify for a level of investment in such private stock
instruments. There are several net worth thresholds for different levels of
capitalization. I don't have copies of the SEC regs on me, but I had dealt
with this issue with the startup I was involved in in Seattle earlier this
decade. People that meet the threshold requirements (it can be a net worth
amount or a gross income amount) are called Qualified Investors. You can also
get stock in pre-IPO companies as compensation for work done for them, either
as an employee or as a contractor.

<a href="0199.html#0203qlink2">&gt; &gt; next i must do the calcs.  i have weights of the empty atlas, so</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; from the info given, weight, size and specific thrust (i will assume</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they really did somehow figure out how to get 350 seconds vac isp</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; out of kerosene and lox with a 400 psi chamber pressure) i can</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; estimate (optimistically) drag coefficients and see if they really do</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have a chance of getting to orbit that way.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I thought they were running at higher pressure than that, but I could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; wrong.  Even at higher pressure and aerospike altitude compensation, it</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be a tough goal.  If 350 sec is an average for the whole flight, 9300</i><br>
<i>&gt; m/s delta-v (which is a good estimate including drag and gravity losses)</i><br>
<i>&gt; the mass ratio is 15 or so.  Even if the averaged specific impulse drops</i><br>
<i>&gt; to 320, the mass ratio stays under 20.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as for using an autogyro reentry system, i have gone even crazier</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; trying to figure out how they could make that happen.  every</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; version of that i can imagine would be nowhere near handling</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the heat load of even a no-payload reentry.  at best, i could imagine</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; blades that would deploy very late in the reentry event, after going</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; subsonic.  this creates the need for a heatshield, which defeats most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; of the advantage of the autogyro system in the first place.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The rotor blades will deploy upward before reentry (like an umbrella blown</i><br>
<i>&gt; inside-out) and stay in the lee of the shock way, minimizing heating.</i><br>
<i>&gt; There, they will make the vehicle passively stable (so that loss of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; reaction control system won't result in the vehicle losing control) but</i><br>
<i>&gt; they won't be spun up for lift until the vehicle slows to sub-sonic.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; heat sheild they are designing will be water transpiration cooled (think</i><br>
<i>&gt; of it as an ablative heat shield, where the ablative material is water and</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's replaced every flight).  They expect to use rotors for hypersonic</i><br>
<i>&gt; lift on later vehicles (both take-off and re-entry) but they now expect to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have to actively cool them.  That is more risk than they want to take on</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a first generation vehicle.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; on the other hand, the system could perhaps be made so simple and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; cheap it would not be so critical to recover anything.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Doubtful.  True land that sucker, fuel it up, kick the tires and fly again</i><br>
<i>&gt; reusability is the only way they will be able to take on the big boys.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the whole exercise gives one a new respect for how deep a gravity</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; well we are in down here.  spike</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually, I've been growing more and more appalled at how the cost and</i><br>
<i>&gt; difficulty of spaceflight has been over stated over the decades.  Only a</i><br>
<i>&gt; government monopoly would think a disposable spacecraft reasonable (for</i><br>
<i>&gt; other than the most basic test purposes).  But once NASA established the</i><br>
<i>&gt; status-quo, no one was able to buck it until now.  I think Rotary will</i><br>
<i>&gt; pull it off, if they have the financial ability to weather the loss of one</i><br>
<i>&gt; or two vehicles during testing.  A lot of "rocket scientists" will have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; lot of explaining to do.</i><br>

<a name="0218qlink1">Has anyone checked on the latest from the various rocketplane companies?
Pioneer Rocketplane seemed to be moving along pretty well a while back.</a>

<p>
<a name="0232qlink1">I've also seen some good performance from some amateur projects which are
using a peroxide(90%)/tar type solid/liquid hybrid fuel system.</a> This
apparently allows a real minimization in the mass of the vehicle, and the
solid fuel is really dense, while the high concentrate peroxide is extremely
reactive.

<a name="0232qlink2">I know that Pioneer was looking at a 95% peroxide/JP-4 system earlier. Now
they are drifting toward a more conventional oxygen/kerosene system.</a>
