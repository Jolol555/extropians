   IAN: Not necessarily. There's a school of thought 
   that argues from libertarian axioms (or purports
   to do so) that copyright, patents, and trademarks
   are artificial-government-fiat monopolies that are 
   contrary to strict property rights.  For example,
   this libertarian school argues that to copyright 
   your book decrees that I can't arrange my property 
   (ink and paper) in a given way, and telling that 
   to me is a violation of my property rights. I'm 
   not an advocate but an opponent of that school,
   and am just noting its existence for the record.

   Suppose that a person invented (or "discovered") 
   an equation that resulted in fusion energy, would 
   they properly have a right to claim a fee from 
   any who profited from that equation? Maybe not.
   Which is not to say it wouldn't be appalling if
   the guy enriched many others and died a pauper.

 cancels the energy of matter exactly. The total energy, or 
  equivalently the total mass, is precisely equal to zero."
