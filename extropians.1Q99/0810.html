I just wanted to say that there seems to be a solution.
Judging by the still relatively slow (IMO) pace of proliferation of
extropian ideas and projects, this statement doesn't seem to be obvious.

<p>
What I don't understand is why you chose to address only the part of my
message that you called "content-free".</a>   I guess criticism of content-free
text is not content-free (or is it content-free of the next degree?), but
in any case it can't construct anything new and positive (and not being a
result of a mistake, probably raises the level of guilt more than the extra
semantic step raises the level of meaning).

<p>
Whatever.

<p>
Let's break out of this meta-meta-nonsense and return to the issue:

<hr>
<br>
<a name="0850qlink1">I suggest creating a projects list, to use low-cost advertising to promote
these projects and other extropian pages, and also solicit other ideas on
how to gain visibility and support for things we would like to see grow.
<hr>

<p>
Would anybody like to do something meaningful and active about this, like
do HTML work, donate some money, or anything else?</a>

<p>
If you have a small practical response, like
"Yeah, I think I could spare 10 bucks to buy 1000 visitors for [Site name]"
or
<br>
"HTML is so hard, but I'll try to help"


<UL>
  <li>  please mail them to me personally; I'll post the summary on the list.


</UL>
<p>
If you have another proposal or meaningful criticism, please post it to
the list.

<p>
Thanks,
