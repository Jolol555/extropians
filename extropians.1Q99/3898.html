<p>
<a href="3870.html#3898qlink1">&gt;I'm interested, Jocelyn.</a><br>
<i>&gt;But - something that has struck me a bit - (because I've often thought of</i><br>
<i>&gt;freeing children in schooling) is that children don't know what their</i><br>
<i>&gt;options are - another good thing is that they don't know their limits - but</i><br>
<i>&gt;sometimes there are opposites and grey areas to this. For instance, some</i><br>
<i>&gt;children have heaps of limits and do know a few of their options. Anyway,</i><br>
<i>&gt;basically the adults and teachers (they should morph into ONE group) should</i><br>
<i>&gt;do two things: Facilitate and allow. Allow the children to be the active</i><br>
<i>&gt;part in their own education and facilitate them by ensuring that they are</i><br>
<i>&gt;not "blocked" and are free in every way and at the same time given all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources and knowledge about the subject that they can.</i><br>


<p>
Children cannot learn their limits unless they are allowed to freely explore
them. They cannot learn their options unless they are allowed to find them.
I think we basically agree. The Sudbury Valley School has plenty of teachers
and resources available; all the child has to do is come to them, rather
than vice versa. Overall, the facilitating is more of a passive process
rather than an active one. I suggest you read the books I listed in my reply
to Michael Wiik. As a friend recently told me, these books will convince you
better than I ever could.
