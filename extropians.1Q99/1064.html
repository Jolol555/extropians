I note that Alaska seems to be trying: putting oil money into a trust fund
whose dividends go to the citizens of the state.  The dividend's about $1000
dollars, so we're not talking good survival money yet, but I'd think the fund
big enough to be tempting.  I suppose the real test will be when the oil runs
out: raise taxes, or plunder the fund?  They'll have to modify</a> the consitution

How so?  By buying the oil?  By providing growth your small country's
investments can skim?</a>
