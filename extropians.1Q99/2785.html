I think this is an area where we have an advantage compared to
traditional theologicans. They are not used to thinking in terms of
computers, levels of implementation, cosmology and (especially)
questioning many of the very fundamental assumptions of godhood most
people seem to take granted. Maybe extropian theology has a future
even if most extropians remain die hard atheists, as the radical study
of theology from a scientific angle.&gt;&gt;

Well put Anders.  I think that Extropians are the obvious gestators of a new
theology that's consistent with our 21st century level of knowledge.  I see no
reason to exclude brave young atheists from theology, I certainly was one not
long ago.
