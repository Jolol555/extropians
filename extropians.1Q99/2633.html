I agree that the argument is faulty.  God allows free oxygen to all
children without taking away free will.  Why couldn't food just be
another free staple on the planet?  How would that prevent free will?&gt;&gt;

<p>
Well, Harvey, who says God gets involved at that level.  This notion of a
personal deity who listens to and helps people in need is not one I share.
The Godlike entity that I see emerging from us, if we live long enough, still
operates in our universe constrained by the laws of nature.

<p>
The main comfort I see coming from such a mega SI is an afterlife a la Frank
Tipler where we can receive our ultimate reward.  It's still very much "God
helps those who help themselves" in our life.

<p>
By the way, I see no conflict between this afterlife  belief (hope) and other
transhuman life extension endeavours like uploading and cryonics.  I believe
in redundant systems when my life is at stake, just to be sure.

<p>
Great thinking,

Adrian
