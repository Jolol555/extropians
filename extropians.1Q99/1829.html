I think that while<a name="1852qlink2"> promulgation of the use of these terms over as wide an area as
possible is beneficial to extropy as a whole, there is the risk</a> of dilution of its
<a name="1852qlink3">meaning, as well as the possible development of negative public opinion of it  if
its use, especially for commercial purposes, if it is not</a> overseen and licensed by
<a name="1852qlink5"><a name="1852qlink4">someone at ExI.</a> While common use of the word obviously is not restricted under the
'fair use' clauses of copyright laws (in the US or Canada), use by a corporate
</a>
<a name="1852qlink6">entity which ExI does not have interest in or some measure of oversight or control
over is a definite infringement on the copyright and trademark.</a>

<p>
Just this past year, there was a debate over a group of european list members
calling their local chapter 'Excedo'. They eventually settled on 'Transcedo' to
maintain friendly relations and good will with everyone.
