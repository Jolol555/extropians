I had previously seen the data Annis cites, and it did convince me 
that we have seen a gradual rise in body size among all life, and 
in and in brain size corrected for body size for land animals. 
If one reasonably assumes that intelligence required a certain 
minimum brain size, then intelligence did arise remarkably quickly
after brains were big enough.  I conclude that the intelligence is 
probably not a hard step.

<p>
Gould himself, actually, points out the steady rise in body size.
He takes pains to attribute this to the boundary condition of a 
minimum feasible size and a initially small size, rather than to
fitness advantages.  That issues, however, is irrelevant for 
the purposes above.

<p>
Brain size per body size does seem a fitness driven change.
