I think this is highly doubtful. The trend of power seems to be moving
in the opposite direction if you look at it historically, and most new
technologies we are discussing here appear to have strong
decentralizing effects - internetworking and strong cryptography makes
it hard to control information flows, easy surveillance can (as David
Brin has argued) break the government monopoly on spying,
nanotechnology removes the need for centralized production, space
colonisation by its nature creates dispersed and independent habitats,
and so on. I think Vernor Vinge put it like "the power of governments
is growing, but the power of individuals is growing at a faster
rate".

<p>
There are a few on this list who argue that certain technologies may
emerge that are so powerful they give a total advantage to their
owners, but this appears doubtful (see the archives for that tiresome
discussion).

<p>
Maybe the trend of power is moving in an orthogonal direction, from
powerful individual to powerful institutions, designed or
spontaneous. Once it was just the kings, now it is the Internet,
government structures and international markets. Note that this
doesn't mean individuals loose power or independence, they just become
parts of greater clusters.
