<p>
The Einstein brain may have functioned a tiny bit differently than other
brains, and close inspection of it has revealed some interesting (although
slight) structural/anatomical differences. Physical neurological
differences in the Einstein brain may have resulted from differences in the
way the brain got used rather than the other way around, in similar fashion
as calloused hands may reflect the way those hands got used rather than that
biology intended them for rough use (the old genotype/phenotype comparison).

<p>
Whether we enhance, augment, amplify, intensify, magnify, or otherwise
embellish intelligence, we (intentionally or unintentionally) increase the
capability of the brain which generates that intelligence. The refreshing
death/rebirth experienced by psychedelic experimenters reminds us that
subjective form and objective function converge to activate self-determined
entities -- to make them tick. Understanding true super-intelligence
requires true ultra-intelligence. So, while we may not have the aptitude for
that, we can nevertheless see that intelligence constantly recreates itself
artificially, unless you prefer to think of it as a natural process (in
which case artifice = nature).

<p>
Your limited research on enhanced intelligence puts you in good company,
since no one else, including eager educators, has come up with reliable
techniques for recreating Einstein's brain artificially (or any other way).
But these few comments here merely serve to preface what I really want to
ask you: Why do you constrain your question to the type of genius
exemplified by Einstein? Why not include Mohammed, Kabir, Shakespeare,
Beethoven, Socrates, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Krishna, and enlightened masters? Do
they not qualify as critical parts of understanding intelligence?

<p>
With a sincere intention to contribute to the integrity of this list, and
not wanting to antagonize anyone, I submit that the Einstein brain and the
Buddha brain have close to identical capabilities. But Buddha died in
blissful Nirvana, while Einstein died disappointed, saying that if he had
his life to live over again, he would have become a plumber instead of a
theoretical physicist. It seems a toss-up to me which engenders more
extropian energy: the cosmically conscious Siddhartha, or the mathematically
gifted Albert. At any rate, ought we not to attempt to understand the
significance of such a powerful technique as meditation (dhyana) in our
search for enhanced intelligence? (Note that I do not here refer to the body
of ritualized superstition known as religion, but rather to scientific
methods of expanding the brain's accurate awareness.)

<p>
You've nailed it once again, Anders. Better than understanding what can go
wrong to subvert or prevent SI, an understanding of what it takes for
intelligence to thrive, burgeon, flourish, and grow seems very
appropriate -- even if it means understanding that intelligence drives all
life before it. Likewise, the diligent extropian seeks to understand and
know what past masters have understood and known, the better to exceed it,
if possible. Unless we see the exquisite immensity that Gurdjieff, Krishna,
et al. saw, we cannot know (or imagine) what other mysterious poesy and
profound adventure awaits us. While I feel confident that all the
enlightened masters approve of extropian use of high-technology, it makes me
sad to think that extropians may miss the vision of beauty and verity
directly experienced by buddhas.

Namaste,
