<a name="3161qlink1">But won't a realistic humanoid sexbot need to have nearly human AI in
order to be convincing?  At least animal AI, right?  Otherwise it's
just a pile of warm flesh that you thrust into (or get thrust by).  I
see the software of a sexbot being at least as tricky as that of my
virtual sex kittens and, coupled with the hardware a hell of a lot
more expensive.  Without extensive AI, it'll just lay there and maybe
moan.  If I'm gonna dish out big bucks for a sexbot, I want a WILD
woman!!</a>

<p>
<a name="3161qlink2">If your sexbot is a recreation of a 110 pound human female, what
happens if her software goes nuts and she starts biting (at the wrong
time), kicking, and generally flailing about during the heat of the
moment?  Possibly major injuries, costly repairs, and maybe
embarassing stains on the furniture...  And that's not to mention the
problems the 225 lb muscle-ripping he-stud that some customers will
want might cause...</a>

<p>
<a name="3161qlink3">If a virtual sex partner goes nuts you should just be able to
disconnect with no harm done (blue screen of coitus interuptus - hee
hee).</a>

<p>
<a name="3161qlink4">Sexbots would entail considerable maintenance (especially mostly
organic ones - imagine changing it's "diapers" - ewwwww).  Virtual sex
partners come with no muss, no fuss.</a>

<p>
<a name="3161qlink5">Besides, with virtual partners one can have sex with pretty much
ANYONE or hell, everyone!  Virtual sex can include as many partners as
can be imagined.  Sexbots provide each customer with one or two
partners - depending on price, maintenance, etc...</a>

<p>
For fantasy purposes, I would think that most men would want an
endless variety of partners.  With a sexbot you might could have
different personalities, and there's always wigs, but without major
technology body shape would stay the same.

<p>
<a name="3161qlink6">Also, virtual sex partners could use the AI of living, breathing
humans remotely located.  I'm sure some of the first applications will
be voyeuristic views of 3D strippers and naughty lovers.</a>

<p>
<a name="3161qlink7">I don't think the idea of sexbots is completely without merit, but I
can't see the technology maturing before we could have really
inexpensive virtual sex partners.</a>

<p>
<a name="3158qlink1">Maybe I'm just putting too much thought into this.</a>

Heh heh
