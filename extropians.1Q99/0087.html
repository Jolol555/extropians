But it is being tested, in the Open Source software community. Cygnus Support
and Red Hat are both successful companies that do research and development
of software and then give away the result. They make money on support. There
are manyu other examples in the Open Source community. Most of the massive
amounts of code they provide is being developed by others, but they are making
significant contributions themselves.
