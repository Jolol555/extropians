Abstract
<br>
  Active oxygen species or free radicals are considered to cause extensive
  oxidative damage to biological macromolecules, which brings about a variety
  of diseases as well as aging. The ideal scavenger for active oxygen should be
  'active hydrogen'. 'Active hydrogen' can be produced in reduced
  water near the cathode during electrolysis of
  water. Reduced water exhibits high pH, low
  dissolved oxygen (DO), extremely high dissolved molecular hydrogen (DH), and
  extremely negative redox potential (RP) values. Strongly
  electrolyzed-reduced water, as well as
  ascorbic acid, (+)-catechin and tannic acid, completely scavenged O.-2
  produced by the hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase (HX-XOD) system in sodium
  phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of
  reduced water is stable at 4 degrees C for over a month and
  was not lost even after neutralization, repeated freezing and melting,
  deflation with sonication, vigorous mixing, boiling, repeated filtration, or
  closed autoclaving, but was lost by opened autoclaving or by closed
  autoclaving in the presence of tungsten trioxide which efficiently adsorbs
  active atomic hydrogen. Water bubbled with hydrogen gas
  exhibited low DO, extremely high DH and extremely low RP values, as does
  reduced water, but it has no SOD-like activity. These
  results suggest that the SOD-like activity of reduced water
  is not due to the dissolved molecular hydrogen but due to the dissolved
  atomic hydrogen (active hydrogen). Although SOD accumulated H2O2 when added
  to the HX-XOD system, reduced water decreased the amount of
  H2O2 produced by XOD. Reduced water, as well as catalase and
  ascorbic acid, could directly scavenge H2O2. Reduce water
  suppresses single-strand breakage of DNA b active oxygen species produced by
  the Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid in a dose-dependent manner,
  suggesting that reduced water can scavenge not only O2.- and
  H2O2, but also 1O2 and .OH.
