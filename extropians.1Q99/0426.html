I prefer discussions to debates.

<p>
Discussions allow for frank exchange of meme system and data.  This allows
one to expand ones knowledge base and upgrade various models of the world
and its contents.

<p>
Debates mainly express mammalian politics, which I find uninteresting and
irrelevant.  It comes down to "I am right, you are wrong." and
"'Shutup!', he explained." in the end.  No new data there.

<p>
Your stated preference for "evil" and the reckless statement for the immediate
destruction of a human populated structure without warning said population
made you appear a potential massmurder.  I would avoid such an entity until
a confrontation made termination with extreme prejudice a necessity.

I rephrase. "You appear to assume that a meme system defines your behaviour
to 100% which would mean that no Free Will existed. The meme system guides
what you can think, not necessarily what you think and do exactly."

I feel you make long reaching conclusions on insuffient data here.
