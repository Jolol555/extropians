This is a convenient fiction for people who like big government, but it
doesn't have much to do with reality.  No government ever asks its citizens
to agree to its rules - you are stuck with them whether you like it or not.
Leaving is also an illusory option - there is literally no place on Earth
where you can go to escape the rule of bog government.  Besides, you can
only leave if the government lets you - and the bigger it gets, the less
likely it is to let you go.</a>

I would be the first to agree that a group of people setting up a new
society in ungoverned space should be able to create any social contract
they like.  However, here on Earth we are stuck with a system no one agreed
to, that no one is allowed to leave.  IMO, that puts important constraints
on the policies that we can endorse with a clear conscience.
