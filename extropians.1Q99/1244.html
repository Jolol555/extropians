We all like to think that we can be beautiful, smart, and destined for much
better things.  It's a noble dream.  But it is pathetic to see it turned into
so much petty downlooking on others.  It's the begining of complacent
snobbery.  If you do not like your position in the pecking order this kind of
attitude could be your theme on a "comfortable" way down. (Lucifer Principle)
Complacency is a waste of time.  In addition to being sorta lewd - like
yanking your genitals out in public.

<p>
Hmmm, lets see an "in-duh-vidual" named "Jethro" and a suggestion to "wear
loose clothing".  Yeah right.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to connect the
dots.  Pretty lame piece, but mildly amusing.  Being a criminal defense
lawyer, I have dealt with a few of your "in-duh-viduals".  Yes they are out
there.  But it might surprise you that many of them can describe themselves
much better than you can.  Sometimes it is just that funny.  Sometimes it is
even funnier.  And sometimes it just isn't.

<p>
Did I take this too seriously?  Perhaps.  But it was either that or take it as
a joke, and that just wasn't as fun.  In my frame of reference it just wasn't
nearly as funny as reality and the fact that SOMEBODY must think this is
funny.  Now that's funny!

&lt;&lt; To paraphrase Scott Adams, who may well have outdone Prof. Minogue, "There
 are two types of people in the world: the bright and attractive people like
 yourself who participate in the Extropy mailing list, and the 6 billion
 idiots who get in our way. Since we're outnumbered, it's a good idea not to
 refer to them as idiots to their faces. A devious Extropy list reader
 suggested calling them 'In-duh-viduals' instead. The advantage to this word
 is that you can insult someone without risk of retribution. Example:
 
<p>
 You: You're quite an Induhvidual, Jethro.
 
<p>
 Jethro: Thank you.

<a href="1239.html#1244qlink1"> "If you're not already surrounded by Induhviduals, you will be soon. New</a><br>
 ones are being born every minute, despite the complexity involved in
 breeding. Frankly, I think much of the procreation of Induhviduals happens
 purely by accident when two of them are trying to do something
 complicated -- like jump-start a car -- and they suddenly get confused.
 Whatever causes the breeding -- and I truly don't want to know the
 details -- it's safe to assume there will be more of it.

  <li>  Wear loose clothing and pretend your car battery is dead.
  <li>  Keep Induhviduals in your car so you can use the car-pool lane.
  <li>  Harness the stupidity of Induhviduals for your own financial gain.

<a href="1239.html#1244qlink3"> "Option one is dangerous. I recommend that you stay away from anything that</a><br>
 involves Induhviduals, electricity, and sex. It's just common sense.

<a href="1239.html#1244qlink4"> "Option two requires you to be in your car with Induhviduals for long</a><br>
 periods of time. There is a real risk that they will attempt to make
 conversation. That would negate any benefits you get from avoiding traffic
 congestion. And if you accidentally leave them in the car and forget to
 crack the window open, they'll die. You'll need more than one of those
 little Christmas-tree air fresheners to solve that problem.
 
<p>
<a href="1239.html#1244qlink5"> "I recommend option three: Harness the stupidity of Induhviduals for your</a><br>
 own financial gain. In order to do that, you'll need to be able to
 anticipate their moves well in advance. This can be difficult, because the
 average Induhvidual does not anticipate his own moves in advance.

 Induhvidual's Pinto and then repeatedly hit that average Induhvidual with
 it, you could make him confess that he has some plans, even if those plans
 are not very exciting:
 
<p>
 AVERAGE INDUHVIDUAL'S PLANS
 

<UL>
  <li>  Become shorter and more crotchety over time.
  <li>  Lose all appreciation of popular music.
  <li>  Cultivate ear hair.
  <li>  Get a new eight-track player.

<a href="1239.html#1244qlink7"> "Clearly, with a world full of people who have goals like that, most of the</a><br>
 things that happen in the future will not be the result of good planning.
 That makes the future difficult to predict. That's why you need to read this
