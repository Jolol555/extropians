Great.  It sounds like you have positioned your paper most efficiently. 
I wasn't sure because you mentioned "Philosophy Journals" without
stating that they were specific to the philosophy of biology.  To me a
"Philosophy Journal" is not necessarily biology-specific.

<p>
<a href="0833.html#0836qlink2">&gt; Philosophers who are writing papers in philosophy of science know that they</a><br>

<p>
I did not question your understanding of the vocabulary, nor did I imply
that you had not carefully researched your topic area.  I was pointing
out
<br>
the consequences of submitting your paper to different types of
journals,
<br>
since you had not specifically stated which types of "Philosophy
Journals" you were considering.

<p>
<a href="0833.html#0836qlink3">&gt; I found the rest of your comments puzzling. Perhaps you are unfamiliar with</a><br>
<i>&gt; philosophy of science. I'm not proposing new nomenclature that scientists</i><br>
<i>&gt; should adopt through a standards committee.</i><br>

<p>
I did misunderstand this point.  I did indeed think that your paper was
proposing a new nomenclature for the classification of new transhuman
species.
