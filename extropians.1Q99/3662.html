<a name="3664qlink2"><a name="3663qlink3">Gina, this world has over 3 billion women now, and most of them
have far less to lose than coddled westerners, and far more to
gain.  I had in mind some perhaps Chinese undersized female,
having had suboptimal nutrition in her childhood, contributing
to her small stature.  Then from that still enormous pool, perhaps
some have damaged legs, either from birth defects or from
accidents.  A spina bifida victim might even be just the ticket,
and if so, think of it:  here is some tiny insignificant crippled
pitiful thing, always marginalized, and suddenly men in suits
are telling her: Ling, here is your biiig chance young lady, to do
something no one has ever done, to go where no man has
gone, to be the greatest heroine since Amelia Erhart, hell since
ever.  You might die.  But you might become the mother of a
new race, perhaps eventually the only race of humans.

Bet she would snap at the chance.
