Well Glen, starting in my family (vis a vis my daughter) I'm the hard
disciplinarian and my wife is the softy, in our business I'm the creative
positive motivator and my wife is the penny pinching "we need more sales"
type.  

<p>
Talking to friends with children, it seems that they have the same model
although there is fluidity in who is the good cop and who is the bad cop, and
other married business owners seem to be the same.

<p>
When I was in the Weapons Dept. on the USS Hunley, we had a hard ass Chief and
a "good guy" First Class.

<p>
Maybe it's just the old "carrot and stick approach,"  but it does seem fairly
ubiquitous and thus worth expanding and generalizing.
