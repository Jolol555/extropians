<a name="1347qlink1">  IAN: Like rocks, galaxies are distinct *collective 
  entities* defined, as each unique galaxy is, by the 
  ordering of its members. Are galaxies confusing? Can 
  we not define "galaxy" since such is a collective
  entity? Merriam Webster's seems to think that 
  we can. So I'm really can see your point in 
  saying "collective entity" is confusing.

<p>
  Clearly, no problem or logical confusion with the 
  definition of "collective entity" as "the ordering 
  of individuals in a system" as been demonstrated,
  which isn't to say that a problem can't be found.</a>

<a href="1229.html#1255qlink2">&gt;Just exactly how is it a denial of the existence of holistic structures to</a><br>

<p>
  IAN: You've supported a case against there being
  a "collective entity" that is without content.
  You deny "collective entity" and then don't,
  so I'm loosing exactly what your point is.


<p>
<a href="1229.html#1255qlink3">&gt;Ian, I've agreed to disagree on the definition of entity. Why do you keep</a><br>
<i>&gt;insisting that everyone play only on your terms (pun intended)? </i><br>


<p>
  IAN: When did I insist? I reply to your responses 
  just as you reply to mine, so it sounds like your
  saying you want me to stop making my case. You've
  not shown that "collective entity" is an illusion.
