Well, what I know of neurology goes down at most to neurotransmitters,
vesicles, and the like - nowhere near microtubule dimers - so I can't
judge on my own.</a>

<a name="3555qlink2">That said, unless somebody is screaming about a gross factual
inaccuracy, I don't mind that other neurobiologists consider their
conclusions wildly speculative or extremely improbable.  Penrose and
Hameroff are both established, respectable scientists and I'm very much
inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to citing
non-computable-looking facts about physics or neurology.  Of course, I
completely disagree with the way they draw their conclusions, but...</a>

<p>
Besides which, they could be flat wrong and it wouldn't make much of a
difference from my perspective.  They're just the major pair even
talking about the details of noncomputability; that's why I refer to them.
