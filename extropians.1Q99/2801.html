<a name="2856qlink1">Tim, Anders, and other &gt;H,

<p>
<a name="2882qlink1">   I would like to second the idea of not getting trapped in the Us vs. Them
meme.  I think it is important to remember that the general public is not the
enemy, they are our families, friends, coworkers, neighbors, and us.  We need
to be able to reach out to those who have not discovered &gt;H, help them to
</a>
understand why we believe what we do, and try to understand what their
concerns and misgivings<a name="2856qlink2"> are.  Remember, even a current enemy can be a future
</a>
ally, so let's neither demonize nor denigrate those who are not yet &gt;H, and
darn well not let anyone demonize or denigrate &gt;H.  We are trying to influence
</a>
the future...well we ARE the future, and by we I mean ALL of humanity.  I
suppose that is why I am interested in reaching out to those who are not &gt;H.
<a name="2856qlink3">Because of our personality types, those of us currently involved in
transhumanism will probably always be somewhere out on the cutting edge of
thought, but if we honestly believe that we are heading in the right
direction, then it would be a good idea to make sure that the rest of humanity
knows where we're going so they can follow if so inclined.</a>
