   CONTRAIL ANALYSIS II

<p>
   If you thought the last photos were extreme...

<p>
   The contrail case continues with pages proposing 
   that contrails are poison spray sprouting up like 
   spring grass. Poison-spray proponents proclaim that 
   contrail persistence, or nonevaporation, is evidence 
   that a contrail is not condensation but a toxic spray. 
   That claim errs, for contrail persistence is a common 
   phenomenon dependant upon relative humidity, and thus
   contrail persistence is not evidence of poison spray.

<p>
   Quoting the conclusion of Contrail Analysis II:

<p>
   CONCLUSION: both my previous contrail analysis and 
   this follow-up analysis present photographic proof 
   that contrails will do the same things that the 
   natural clouds around them will do; which in turn 
   proves that what contrails do -- whether they will 
   evaporate quickly or slowly expand into one of many 
   patterns -- is a function of the natural atmospheric
   conditions in which the contrail was formed. This is 
   not a new revelation, just as contrail persistence 
   is neither a mysterious phenomenon nor evidence of 
   spraying. <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/contral2.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/contral2.htm</a>
