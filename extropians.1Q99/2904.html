   Just thought it was interesting that there might have been a shift, and was
hoping to see what the exact nature of the changes were by comparing the new
and old versions of the Principles.  It doesn't matter how much a policy
changes over time, but only that those changes be adaptive/improvements...I
really don't know which it would be, as I am not entirely clear on the
changes, and once I am, who's to say my opinion of them would be correct?  Do
you have a copy of the original Principles, by any chance?
