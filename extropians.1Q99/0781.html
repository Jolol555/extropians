I once developed a cooperative game named CoLife that had color cells
for two players.  The evolution rule is the same as in Life; the rule
for color is: the cell born gets the dominant color of the parents 
(since there are always 3 parents, and 2 colors, there is always a
maximum).   In between the evolutionary steps, each of the two players
could add a piece of their own color to the field.  The [common] goal
of the game was to keep the populations balanced on the highest possible
<a name="0787qlink2">level.  The game appeared a bit hard for humans, but post-humans will
probably enjoy things like that.
<br>
Also, in the same game, there was a third, disease color,</a> that the cells
<a name="0787qlink3">would turn after a certain number of generations of being stagnant.
The "stagnation disease" didn't have it's own moves, or strategy,</a> but it
<a name="0787qlink4">would infect all new cells born near even one diseased cell.

<p>
What I meant by mutations and noise:  Mutations would affect non-zero
cells, by killing them, or moving them a little,</a> or temporarily changing,
<a name="0787qlink5">for one point, reproduction rules. (Or maybe more, like turning</a> some group
<a name="0787qlink6">of cells a multiple of 90 degrees).  Noise would also affect</a> empty space,
<a name="0787qlink7">by randomly creating points on it.   There isn't much difference here,
I agree, but there is a slight difference in programming,</a> and also noise
<a name="0787qlink8">can bring life into existence from scratch.  Maybe, not all life forms?
One probably needs a high degree of initial noise to jump-start</a> an openended
<a name="0787qlink9"> evolutionary process...
