Abstract
<br>
  Birds have a maximum longevity (MLSP) much higher than mammals of similar
  body size in spite of their high metabolic rates. In this study, State 4 and
  State 3 rates of H2O2 production were lower
  in canary (MLSP = 24 years) and parakeet (MLSP = 21 years) than in mouse
  (MLSP = 3.5 years) heart mitochondria.
  Studies using specific inhibitors of the respiratory chain indicate that free
  radical generation sites at Complexes I and III are responsible for these
  differences. Main mechanisms lowering H2O2
  production in these birds are a low rate of
  mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the parakeet and a low
  mitochondrial free radical leak in the canary. Strong
  increases in H2O2 production during active
  respiration (State 3) released by addition of ADP to
  pyruvate/malate-supplemented mitochondria are avoided in
  three species because the free radical leak decreases during the transition
  from State 4 to State 3 respiration. These results, together with those
  previously obtained in pigeons and in various mammalian species, suggest that
  the rate of mitochondrial free radical
  production correlates better with the rate of aging and the
  MLSP than the metabolic rate. They also suggest that a low rate of
  mitochondrial H2O2
<br>
  production is a general characteristic of birds, animals
  showing very slow aging rates.
