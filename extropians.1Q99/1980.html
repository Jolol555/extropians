Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm sure someone will), but all the 'time
travel' phenomena that I've heard about are to do with
things(information) apparently moving faster than the speed of light.
The interpretation that they are moving backwards in time is solely due
to a refusal to believe that something can travel at FTL speeds, as this
