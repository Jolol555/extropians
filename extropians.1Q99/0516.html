<a name="0524qlink1">I have an Algernic disability with respect to symbols; this includes
both chunking and what you call indirection.  I can't work with
abstractions from abstractions at all.  I can't manipulate systems of
systems; only the grounding.  My abilities are all oriented towards
digging down, reducing, asking why; not building symbols about symbols. 
I will never understand most of "Godel, Escher, Bach" this side of the dawn.

I can't get lost in a maze of words; I don't have the infrastructure.</a>

<a name="0524qlink2">As for limited working memory, most of my thinking is about the relation
between two concrete objects, which - counting the relation, the
objects, and my thinking - takes only four places in short-term memory*.</a>

(*) = Not a very good way of looking at it.  The objects and their
relation occupy a single mental simulation; at any given time I am
probably focusing on a particular set of rules and trying to deduce
facts, or vice versa.  Anyway, I don't run out of RAM.
