<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I live in the Orlando, Florida area.  We have two or three toddlers kill</i><br>

<i>&gt; repeating event in our community.  For some reason, we can't get parents</i><br>
<i>&gt; to lock up their guns, and the same tragedy keeps repeating.  We have</i><br>
<i>&gt; specialized laws and education programs, but nothing stops this trend.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The point is, our local area has more accidental child fatalities due to</i><br>
<i>&gt; guns than you claim for the entire U.S.  Your statistics just don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; match reality.</i><br>

<a name="2335qlink1">I suggest you get off the major media teat. As the anti-gunners do, the media
considers a child to be anyone under age 15. Hardly a toddler. Most of those
'children' between age 9 and 15 are experienced drug dealers, pimps, and
prostitutes. There is nothing 'accidental' at all. I get my stats off of the
national accident stats. If Florida has a problem, they aren't reporting it in the
stats. The media can easily hype one or two cases up into a frenzy. Its the same
sort of frenzy that got assault weapons banned, even though they were used in less
than 1% of violent crimes.

<p>
Also, note I said that those 31 were killed. This does not include those who were
merely injured.
