<a href="0284.html#0381qlink1">&gt;Suppose you set up a radio system on your property, just for personal</a><br>
<i>&gt;use, such that not much radio energy leaks onto your neighbors.  But the</i><br>
<i>&gt;guy next door is trying to build a radio telescope, and his equipment</i><br>
<i>&gt;is so sensitive that your low power transmissions interfere with his</i><br>
<i>&gt;observations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;He ought to be able to come to you and pay you not to emit radio waves of</i><br>
<i>&gt;a frequency and power level which will interfere with your observations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sure that we will all agree that this would be a legitimate contract.</i><br>


<p>
Or he could tell you that leaking any frequencies form youtr land onto his
was a violation of his property and you should get the hell off.


<p>
<a href="0284.html#0381qlink2">&gt;It seems that the view of the EM spectrum as property is consistent with</a><br>
<i>&gt;the view that people have the right to do what they want on their own</i><br>
<i>&gt;property, as long as you set up the initial allocations correctly.  Start</i><br>
<i>&gt;off with the rights in the hands of individuals, and let them sell them</i><br>
<i>&gt;as they wish.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;After a short startup period, you'll end up with the same situation</i><br>
<i>&gt;you'd have today if the FCC auctioned off the spectrum, to a first</i><br>
<i>&gt;approximation.  The spectrum would be bought and sold on the basis</i><br>
<i>&gt;of economic value rather than political influence, and you'd get the</i><br>
<i>&gt;benefits of increased efficiency.</i><br>


<p>
So everyone owns the spectrum over their property?

<p>
What's the oint of buying the spectrum for a large area if it doesn't
include Bob's house right in the middle (because Bob doesn't want you
broadcasting over his house).  Yiou can't selectively broadcast over a large
qarea, after all.
