Alas, Max, the Nature Conservancy has made a practice of handing over to
statist officials the title to the lands they have purchased.  For that
reason, I let my membership lapse.  I would, however, heartily support a more
enlightened organization that keeps title to wild lands and develops moneymaking
 recreational uses of them.  One big problem:  Any private park has to
compete with multitudes of subsidized statist ones.

<p>
<a href="3125.html#3128qlink1">&gt;One other way that is already being used is best exemplified by the Nature</a><br>
<i>&gt;Conservancy. I was a member some years ago and should look into renewing</i><br>
<i>&gt;(after checking out what they've been up to). In contrast to groups that</i><br>
<i>&gt;look to government to force people to preserve areas of land unchanged, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nature Conservancy raises money then *buys* the land and sets it aside so</i><br>
<i>&gt;that it is not built upon. I presume this could sometimes actually bring in</i><br>
<i>&gt;a profit to the NC, if they charged a fee for hikers, limited camping</i><br>
<i>&gt;activities, etc.</i><br>
