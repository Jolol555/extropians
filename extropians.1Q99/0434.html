<a href="0294.html#0434qlink1">&gt; It's possible that by capitalist, he meant people who's only definition of</a><br>
<i>&gt; good was capital - ie those who worship money rather than using it as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; means to an end.  I'm very happy to use money as a means to an end and as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; useful tool and abstract concept.  I have a strong dislike of people to whom</i><br>
<i>&gt; the only good is money.</i><br>

People whose only end is money do a lot more good for the future of
humanity than those who use money as a means to irrational ends.
They may not inspire our respect, but I am grateful for their
contributions.  In a relatively free market such as ours, at least
a majority of wealth is made by people doing things other people
want enough to pay for; therefore earning profit is inherently a
morally and socially responsible act (I use the weasel words above
like "relatively" and "majority" because it is still possible in
our society to make money by legal theft--corporate welfare, farm
subsidies and price supports, government contracts, etc.)
