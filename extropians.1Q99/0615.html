if the

Just as
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink4">&gt;with natural predators, criminals will develop a 'drug of choice' or</a><br>
preferred
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink5">&gt;form of prey, which is why most criminals only practice one or two forms</a><br>
of crime.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink6">&gt;Violent crime is similarly a form of repressed predation. Since in an urban</a><br>
<i>&gt;environment, there is no other species besides humans, dogs, cats, and</i><br>
rats, you
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink7">&gt;will get sociopathic individuals who will express their natural hunting urges</a><br>
<i>&gt;first upon 'acceptable' species to prey upon, then marginally</i><br>
<i>&gt;acceptable/unacceptable species (dogs and cats), then as the individual</i><br>
becomes
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink8">&gt;more dislocated from society, they may prey upon the unacceptable prey</a><br>
species,
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink9">&gt;humans. This progression is a visible indication of the progression of their</a><br>
<i>&gt;mental illness, but the hunting urge is not the illness, merely how the</i><br>
illness
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink10">&gt;expresses itself in an environment of a limited ecosystem.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is one reason why I view the general urban/vegetarian fear of guns</i><br>
and gun
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink11">&gt;owners as also an instinctual fear that the herbivore has for the</a><br>
carnivore. We
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink12">&gt;as humans also have this instinct, which comes to the fore as we practice a</a><br>
<i>&gt;vegetarian lifestyle, since we did evolve from vegetarian/scavengers who were</i><br>
<i>&gt;preyed upon by many predators, including homo erectus, and the great cats.</i><br>
This
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink13">&gt;fear, when it becomes the core of mental illness, is manifested in</a><br>
haplophobia,
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink14">&gt;which is recognized in the literature as an irrational fear of guns. It is an</a><br>
<i>&gt;illness of transference, as we have a natural fear of seeing the natural</i><br>
weapons
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink15">&gt;of predators exhibited.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When attacked, a herbivore will tend to flee, while an omnivore will tend</i><br>
to stand
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink16">&gt;and fight, which explains the whole debate over right-to-carry vs.</a><br>
<i>&gt;no-right-to-carry concealed weapons, as it is merely a manifestation of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;different viewpoints of the herbivorous (sublimated as an economic</i><br>
herbivore or as
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink17">&gt;an actual vegetarian) humans who prefer to avoid and flee and that of the</a><br>
<i>&gt;omnivorous humans who would prefer to stand and fight a predator, and</i><br>
would prefer
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink18">&gt;to be equally matched to that predator in weaponry. Herbivorous humans, as</a><br>
herd
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink19">&gt;creatures, will depend upon the 'tamed' few deviants they think they have</a><br>
control
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink20">&gt;of (i.e. police/government) to protect them from the predators, but will</a><br>
also seek
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink21">&gt;to disarm the omnivores due to misplaced association with the predators.</a><br>


<p>
<a name="0634qlink2">  IAN: An interesting theory and a lot of valid 
  insight seems to be in there. A counter that 
  comes to mind is: Why would mice become prone
  to violence in close-in high-population living?
  OK, that could be because they Hunt insects. So
  we need to see what happens to rabbits or some 
  group of animals that is hard-core vegi, and 
  if it did not display an increase in violence
  in crowded habitation, your theory could be 
  correct. But I suspect that even rabbits will
  get more aggitated and cantankerous if crowded.</a>

<p>
  Of course such experiments directly imply a naked 
  aggression against free wills of sentient beings.


<p>
<a name="0634qlink3"><a href="0570.html#0615qlink22">&gt;&gt;   Also, most primates aren't carnivores, and</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   as I recall, if they eat any flesh it's less</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   than 10% of their diet (the great apes are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   strict vegetarians), and so the idea of a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   human "hunting instinct" seems debatable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Uh, not quite. While the gorilla and orangutan are vegetarians, chimps and</i><br>
baboons
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink23">&gt;are omnivorous carnivores, eating everything from roots to leaves and nuts</a><br>
and
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink24">&gt;fruit, grubs to lizards, birds and injured ungulates, etc. including,</a><br>
sometimes,
<br>
<i>&gt;each other.</i><br>

<p>
  IAN: What's the deal? That's 100% consistent 
  with what I said and know.? We've probably
  also seen the same nature shows.</a>


<p>
<a name="0634qlink4"><a href="0570.html#0615qlink25">&gt;Now, as for humans, considering that we have evidence of  tool use in the</a><br>
<i>&gt;harvesting of ungulates (proto-horses, proto-bison, mammoths, proto-deer,</i><br>
etc) as
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink26">&gt;well as other species like the great sloth, cave bear, etc, for several</a><br>
hundred
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink27">&gt;thousand years, and we have fossilized spears etc which are also several</a><br>
hundred
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink28">&gt;thousand years old, we know that hunting has been a constant practice of</a><br>
human
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink29">&gt;beings throughout their history. We also know that the late homo erectus</a><br>
preyed
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink30">&gt;upon the early homo sapiens, as well as many other species, so the evolved</a><br>
<i>&gt;practices go much farther back than just human history.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We also know from the few cases of 'feral children' that hunting is a</i><br>
practice
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink31">&gt;which develops naturally if the opportunity is there (i.e. there is ample</a><br>
game
<br>
<a href="0570.html#0615qlink32">&gt;available to develop skills with).</a><br>

<p>
  IAN: There is also a swimming instinct that
  even infants can automatically access when 
  in water. It's an interesting line of inquiry 
  you've opened up, but again, I think</a> there's
  so many other obvious reasons why crime is 
  higher in urban and lower in rural areas;
  but the fact that other causes exist cannot
  in itself rule out the theory you've raised.
