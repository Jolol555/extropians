hi all,

<p>
Finally some good news out of the congress: they are reintroducing SAFE
"Security and Freedom through Encryption"  loosening regulations on
data-scrambling software. Not perfect but better than the current situation.

<p>
<a name="2568qlink1">More good news, the people advertising for help killing doctors providing
abortions have been nailed (Nuremberg Files was the site that  posted the
names, phone numbers, and home addresses of abortion doctors, and then
struck out their names as they were murdered one by one).</a>

<p>
Both pieces available from the best code developer's shed in town

<p>
&lt;<a href="http://beta.devshed.com/News/">http://beta.devshed.com/News/</a>&gt;

<p>
<a name="2578qlink1">What is the extropian position on these two? We no doubt all agree about
free crypto, and certainly I am glad the Nuremberg decision happened this
way. They are perfect example of first-use force hiding behind free speech.
These anti own-body control memes retard the rate at which we get to
transcend ourselves
</a>

<p>
best tim
