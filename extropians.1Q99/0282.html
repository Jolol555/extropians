<p>
What "constitutionally-valid government choices"?  Does anyone really think
that RF regulation has anything to do with interstate commerce?  I certainly
don't see anything else in the U.S. Constitution that could be construed as
authorizing the FCC.

<p>
If the states want to create RF spectrum property rights, great.  If they
want to regulate radio transmissions, well, most of them are authorized to
do so.  But the Federal Government?  It has no Constitutional authorization
to be involved in such matters.</a>
