<a href="0667.html#0698qlink1">&gt;I understand but disagree with the arguments that yield the "conservative"</a><br>
<i>&gt;stance.  It seems less a simple inconsistency than a skewed prioritizing</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the lives of potential beings over existing ones.  As for the corollary</i><br>
<i>&gt;"liberal" inconsistency, notice that the whiff of paradox vanishes if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"liberal" permits abortions for both human and nonhuman animals, while</i><br>
<i>&gt;also pooh-poohing the consumption of either human or nonhuman animals as</i><br>
<i>&gt;food.  Again, existing beings have priority over nonexisting ones.  No</i><br>
<i>&gt;inconsistency at all.  Best, Dale</i><br>


<p>
The basic argument is


<OL>
  <li>  Killing people is wrong.
  <li>  Foetuses are people.


</OL>
<p>
Most people would go with statement 1, less people with statement 2.

<p>
The problem being that it's hard to define when a foetus becomes a person.
For instance, my father is a neonatologist specialising in premature babies.
I know his NICU has dealt with babies down to 22 weeks gestation and they
have survived.  This would seem to indicate higher personhood than the ball
of 8 cells that they are a teensy bit earlier in their gestation.  Only
counting people as people when they are born seems a tad arbitrary.
