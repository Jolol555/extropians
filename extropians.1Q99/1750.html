Gas stations would need generators to run their pumps, for sure. I'm thinking
that it might be very profitable to just go get my electricians license
again... everyone will need to be taken off the grid so they can run their
buildings off of generators... then put back on when the power is back. I can

<a name="1757qlink1">I don't know where you are shopping, but my Northern Supply Catalog rep has
given me a three-to-four week delivery time on a 20kw generator. Generators
10kw or less are in stock. For a business of more than that, just buy a bunch

controllers after Jan 1 and they should be ok.
