GO and buy a copy of Richard Dawkin's books (any will do. Extended phenotype

If this wasn't a module which required you to believe in god, you would

Then you might see how there is no way to advance an adaptive walk on a random
(chaotic) fitness landscape.  Only a correlated fitness landscape (ordered
perhaps by as yet unknown laws of complex systems) permits adaptive walks</a> to
advance.
