<p>
Although I have always been "pro-gun", it wasn't until the rabid anti-gun
movement took off that I actually started purchasing them.  In fact, I have
a lot of friends who purchased their first gun *because* of the gun control
movement.

<p>
And of course, it is a short step between purchasing your first gun and
</a>
becoming a collector.  While I have no specific evidence to back it up, I
believe that gun control activism may have actually increased the
penetration of gun ownership in several segments of society by motivating
many individuals who otherwise would not have purchased them.

Nice choices (says I, owner of three HK USPs among other things).  :^)

<a name="1654qlink3">Despite the "powerful gun lobby" image promoted in the press, I always
thought the NRA was a fairly impotent organization.  The JPFO and GOA,
while smaller, are fiery groups and seem to focus more on principles than
politics.  Politicians in particular seem to be very uncomfortable saying
anything negative about the JPFO.</a>

<p>
(I am going to relabel this as OT for the sake of the list)
