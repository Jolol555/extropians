<a name="0744qlink2">Good point, but I was referring to governments.  In the case of the
spaceship we may not be talking about a government.  What if someone
on the ship worked really hard to create something *really* valuable
and then decided not to share it with her crewmates.  Since she's
confined to a spaceship, her association with her crewmates is no
longer voluntary.  Would they have to resort to force to make her
share her creation or would the socialist commune partially dissolve?</a>

<p>
My point is that socialist governments must by their very nature use
force against peaceful citizens to make them participate.  Those who
advocate socialist governments are therefore advocating the use of
violence.  Unless the association with the group is voluntary, force
is required.
