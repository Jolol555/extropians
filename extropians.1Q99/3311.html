<a href="3280.html#3311qlink1">&gt; Here are some current musings of mine.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Transhumanism - The philosophy which advocates achieving complete control over</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself and my environment in order to improve (as I define improvement)</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself.</i><br>

<p>
Is really total control the goal? While I certainly want to control my
aging or mental states, I don't really need or want control over the
details of my intestines most of the time. I think it is better to
think in terms of influence: how can you get the desired results? 

<p>
<a href="3280.html#3311qlink2">&gt; Some Transhuman philosophical challenges:</a><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  Who am I? (the defining of the self)</i><br>
<i>&gt; 2)  How do I determine if another entity in my environment has a self?</i><br>
<i>&gt; 3)  How do I interact with others with a self who are in the same environment?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Obviously, working toward the first definition wouldn't be ethically difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt; if it weren't for the fact that there seems to be other beings with a sense of</i><br>
<i>&gt; self in my environment, and this leads to the question, "If I have the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; to control myself and my environment, don't they?  But if they are in my</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment, then they are a part of my environment, so don't I need to</i><br>
<i>&gt; control them?  And if they are in my environment, aren't I in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment, and thus something they need to control?  Maybe if I left out</i><br>
<i>&gt; that part about my environment and focused on myself....but wait, I am rather</i><br>
<i>&gt; strongly embedded in my environment, in fact on some levels it is difficult to</i><br>
<i>&gt; discern where I stop and the environment starts, and it is awefully hard to</i><br>
<i>&gt; totally control my life without at least some control of my environment....uh</i><br>
<i>&gt; oh.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="3312qlink1"><i>&gt; Extropianism - a broad theory of how best to achieve &gt;H goals based on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; concept that rationality, extreme decentralization, and maximization of free</i><br>
<i>&gt; and copious flows of information and resources provides the best environment</i><br>
<i>&gt; to foster Transhumanism.</i><br>

<p>
Wouldn't extropianism in this context also be linked to the view that
<br>
<i>&gt;H can be achieved in an useful way if you and other selves do not try</i><br>
to control each other or each other's proximal environments (where
they can be defined), and instead set up cooperative systems?  Or
<a name="3317qlink1">should we come up with another term for that idea to distinguish</a> it,
like "translibertarianism" or something similar?

<p>
Interesting musings.
