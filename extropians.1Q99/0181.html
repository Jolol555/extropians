Hardly. The fundamental problem with grey goo is 'how do I stop myself
eating my copies?', just as the fundamental problem with computer virii
is 'how do I stop myself infecting programs I've already infected?'. If
a virus doesn't check for prior infections it pretty quickly destroys
the computer it's running on, and kills itself in the process.</a> If grey goo 
doesn't have some means to detect other grey goo then it will soon eat
itself up along with everything else.

<p>
But, of course, if there's a way to detect a virus you can use that to
pretend your computer is infected and stop it (AFAIR this technique was 
used to slow the spread of the Internet Worm). And if there's a way to
detect other grey goo nanobots you can use that to pretend you're a grey
goo nanobot and walk safely thru a sea of grey goo.

<p>
Personally I think this identification problem will be extremely hard to
solve in any manner, which is one reason why I'm not very concerned about 
grey goo.
