Can you be more specific?  What national accident stats, from whom,
available where?  I just did a search for children and guns, and came up
with these stats.  It looks like there are about over 200 children
accidentally shot to death every year.  I agree that these numbers are
very low when compared to other childhood risks.  I am merely pointing
out that your claim of 31 children in 35 years in the U.S. is way low.
It is more like 8000 children under the age of 15 have been accidentally
shot to death in the U.S. in the last 35 years.

John R. Lott, Jr., pro-gun author of the book "More Guns, Less Crime"
says that each year 200 children 14 years of age and under are
accidentally killed by guns, but argues that this is statistically low
when comparied to other childhood risks of accidental death.

The CDN-Firearms digest, a pro-gun publication, argues that claims that
1000 children are accidentally killed every year with guns are
exxaggerated.  They state that in 1988 the number was really 277
children under the age of 15 accidentally killed with a firewarm.  In
1990, the number fell to 236.  For that year, 34 children were under the
age of 5, 56 children were aged 5-9, and 146 children were aged 10-14.

The Teletimes, in a pro-gun article, states that in 1990, 236 children
up to the age of 14 died as a result of firearm accidents.
