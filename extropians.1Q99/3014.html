<a name="3025qlink2">World's Glaciers Show No Evidence of Global Warming

<p>
Major Polar Glaciers are Expanding, Not Causing a Rise 
</a></a>in Sea Level

<p>
The world's glaciers are not drastically receding due 
to alleged man-made global warming but in many cases 
are expanding, according to a recently released 
National Policy Analysis paper by the National Center 
For Public Policy Research.

<p>
Proponents of the theory that man-made greenhouse 
gases are dangerously warming the planet point to 
retreating glaciers as evidence of global warming 
affecting the climate.  Global warming theory 
proponents claim that these melting glaciers will 
cause a catastrophic rise in sea level which may 
submerge major seaboard cities like New York in coming 
centuries.  By scaring the public with such 
apocalyptic visions, the environmental movement hopes 
to build support for the Clinton Administration's 
agenda of imposing economically-damaging cuts in the 
nation's greenhouse gas emissions. 
	
<p>
However, according to National Policy Analysis paper 
#235, "Behavior of the World's Glaciers Fails to Prove 
Global Warming Theory," glacial activity disproves the 
global warming theory.  Authored by John Carlisle, 
director of the National Center's Environmental Policy 
Task Force, the paper argues that global warming 
theory proponents are wrong to point to the retreat of 
some glaciers in the mid-latitude regions of the 
planet as evidence of warming since glaciers respond 
to a variety of complex natural phenomena other than 
global temperature variations.  Furthermore, midlatitude
 glaciers represent only 6% of the world's 
glacial ice while Antarctica and Greenland, on the 
other hand, contain 94% of the glacial ice.  
Contradicting predictions of alleged global warming's 
climatic impact, the Antarctic and Greenland glaciers 
are advancing which has the effect of lowering sea 
level.

<p>
"The advance of the polar glaciers indicates that 
there is no evidence that global warming is melting 
glaciers and thus no reason to fear a catastrophic 
rise in sea level," says Carlisle.  "Instead of 
providing proof of global warming, glacial behavior 
represents yet another powerful indictment of this 
already controversial theory."

The Environmental Policy Task Force is a project of 
The National Center For Public Policy Research, a nonpartisan,
 non-profit education foundation.  The Task 
Force was established to find and promote innovative, 
workable solutions to environmental problems - 
solutions that minimize the suffering of working 
Americans while still protecting the environment.
