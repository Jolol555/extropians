Yes I am. However, the abortion is a debate on the legal status of the fetus in
the current system. There is no current system in existence which allows for
citizenship for the unborn, based on location during conception. You must be
born somewhere to be given citizenship there. A person without a country in the
present day has no big thug to protect him from other big thug governments, and
has no rights except and unless the big thug picking on the nationless
individual is a signer of the UN Human Rights treaty. We are talking about
legalities here, not absolutes. As I said, I do beleive that abortion is killing
a being., but under the current legal systems everywhere it is not murder any
more than putting a dog to sleep can be murder.
