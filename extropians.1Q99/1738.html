More to the point, the power companies have known about this problem since
at least early '98.<a name="1741qlink2">  Since they don't want all their equipment to fail, most

<p>
Now, obviously, there will probably be a few companies that don't.
Likewise, there will probably be a few chips here and there that don't get
replaced.  However, that sort of problem isn't going to lead to anything
worse than localized power outages.

A national power outage would disrupt our nice computerized distribution

<a href="1716.html#1738qlink3">&gt; According to the military people I know, their saying its the military</a><br>

<i>&gt; way on everyone else. The military is not a democracy , it's chain-of-</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Although these are the points we differ,  I hope I'm wrong and your</i><br>

<p>
This is a universal problem with standing armies, of course.  However,
America has some interesting legal theory that addresses the point.

<p>
Back during the war crimes trials after WWII, a lot of German military
personnel tried to claim they were not responsible for their actions because
they were 'just following orders'.<a name="1741qlink8">  The Allies didn't want them to get off
that easily, and thus they created a new legal doctrine of personal
responsibility that still applies today.</a>  As interpreted in America, it goes
like this:

<p>
A soldier takes his oath to the constitution, not to a superior officer.
His first duty is to defend that Constitution.  If he is given orders that
clearly violate the Constitution he is required to refuse them.  If he
doesn't, and the matter later comes under investigation, he can face court
martial - in the worst cases this can even be considered treason, which
carries a death penalty.

<p>
Now, the average grunt isn't necessarily up to speed on this sort of legal
arcana.  However, most officers and senior NCOs are.  If a general orders
his unit conduct a warrantless search of Dallas, TX, and confiscate any
firearms they find, his entire chain of command is going to start worrying
about their careers.  If he adds "and shoot anyone who tries to stop you"
they aren't going to waste time worrying - they will lock him up and call
upstairs for a sane replacement.

<p>
To get around this problem you need a situation so desperate that people are
worried about survival, and legal considerations seems remote and unlikely
to matter.  That takes a lot more than just rioting and food shortages.  You
need a situation where it looks like there aren't going to be any more court
martials - a disintegrating government, mass chaos, rioting, people starving
and shooting each other in droves, etc.  You also have to be giving orders
that make sense to the people in the middle levels of the chain of command -
and remember, they don't especially want a totalitarian government.

<p>
I've never seen a plausible Y2K scenario that even comes close to this.  You
could instantly vaporize every computer in the world and not get it.  You
need something more like a nuclear war, or a large asteroid impact.
