<i>&gt; &gt;Samael makes a puzzling comment:</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;I just believe there are greater goods than property protection</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;(life protection, for instance).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Are you saying that your life is not your property?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think of my life as an object.  It's a feature of mine a 'property'</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the same way as 'dark hair' is.  It's just a feature I've grown very fond</i><br>
<i>&gt; of.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, I've grown very fond of my head, I should be very sad to part with it. That
is my right to the property known as my head. Similarly, I need my car to do my
job, to earn my living which buys my food, shelter, and energy. Therefore, I am
very fond of it (no matter what a pain in the but it is to take care of, that is
a different issue), and I should be very sad to be deprived of it. In both
cases, losing either property will have a significant impact on my life, one a
bit more than the other. My posessions, including my head, afford me a greater
measure of liberty in the world which I find necessary to my pursuit of
happiness. Greater amount of property provides greater liberty, I have found. If
we are to promote increased liberty for individuals, we should also promote
increased property in the hands of individuals.

<p>

<a href="0419.html#0433qlink2">&gt; &gt;You can't divorce your life from the resources that make your life</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;possible. It's nonsense to write as if property weren't part and parcel of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;your existence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are things I use during my existence and things I 'own'.  My life is</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a different quality of any of them and could continue (at least</i><br>
<i>&gt; temporarily) without any of them.</i><br>

<p>
I might continue to live as a slave as well. It is hardly of acceptable quality.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0419.html#0433qlink3">&gt; &gt;Since property includes life itself, there can be no higher good than</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;protection of property.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since carbon compunds include life itself, there van be no higher good than</i><br>
<i>&gt; the protection of carbon compunds.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't think you're stringing together a coherent argument here.</i><br>

<p>
Funny, I don't think that you are.
