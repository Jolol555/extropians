This is the prime reason it is so difficult. The weather does not change as a
result of someone predicting what is going to happen, but producers and
consumers always change their behavior based on what the economists say, which
winds up skewing the actual performance away from the predicted result. Things
have been fine in the past ten years because people are happy with the way
things are going, so they don't want to disturb the equilibrium. The moment some
politician comes along promising to make things even better with their pet law,
the equilibirum will get disturbed, creating resonance effects that, if they
feed back upon each other, may spin things out of synch with people's wants.

<a href="3247.html#3248qlink2">&gt; However, IMO the public skepticism of economists is entirely justified for</a><br>

Economics should be considered to be a form of what has been called 'warning
fiction'. They accurately extrapolate what will happen if things go on as they
are. When the results of that extrapolation are out of synch with what people
want, they will change their behavior to prevent that unwanted future from
happening.

<a href="3247.html#3248qlink3">&gt; The public gave economists their chance.  We've seen their advice have a</a><br>

<p>
Note how Greenspan has established a practice of not sharing the long range
foecasts of the Federal Reserve, which is why the stock market surges or dives
on the slightest comment of his. Everybody knows they have the most
sophisticated modeling systems, but if they give out the results of the models,
the real world will change. Its the uncertainty principle in action. The Fed
therefore tries to act kind of like Asimov's Second Foundation.
