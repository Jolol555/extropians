<p>
If something can move FTL, then relativity is obviously not correct in
the first place. The reason FTL is dismissed in relativity (besides
the impossibility of accelerating beyond c) is that it would
completely mess up causality, which generally is/was regarded as a bad
thing. If you buy Novikov's principle of self-consistency or something
similar, then this might not be a serious problem after all -
causality gets weird and loopy, but not inconsistent. 

<p>
However, "time travel" in various forms can be done without FTL. One
example would be wormholes, which are allowable solutions to general
relativity (even if their physical possibility remains unknown). With
wormholes you can move to a distant time and/or space without going
FTL in your local frame. The same problems with causality might
emerge, but again quantum effects such as the Visser build up of
virtual particle or Novikov's principle might keep physics sane.
