This whole string really reminds me of Christian Missionaries and the like.

<p>
My question is: If you really believe something strongly, how can you
possibly be expected not to try to show the truth to others? Of course there
are great differences between The missionaries of Christ and the
missionaries of cryonics, but let me give you two hypothetical situations.
It's pretty rough when we're forced to choose between our own views and
respecting the views of others.

<p>
situation A:

<p>
Your child is bent on eating a certain plant you know to be poisonous, but
you will not let them. Of course, no matter how much they beg, plead, and
disregard your warnings you will not give in, right? Is it different if this
person is the same age as you?

<p>
Situation B:

<p>
Now supposing this person wanted this plant because it was an antidote for a
certain other poison he or she had just injested, and you did not believe
them.

<p>
Can you see where I'm going with this? Or is it anything new to anyone? I'm
interested in hearing what you all say about the rights of one person to
"act in the best interest" of another.
<br>
If you truly believe something with all of your heart (as a Christian might)
would it not be wrong even to keep it to yourself?

<p>
