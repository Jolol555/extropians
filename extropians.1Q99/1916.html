Absolutely wrong.<a name="1923qlink2"> What do you think a wing does? Any airfoil or hydrofoil shape is
</a>
useful because it translates foward motion to upward accelleration</a> when oriented
<a name="1923qlink3">to the proper angle of attack to generate lift. This is why it shot</a> upward so fast
<a name="1923qlink4">when it lost its nose, and why the nose started dropping so quickly.</a> The angles of
<a name="1923qlink5">attack of the two parts generated lift (upward for the rear section,</a> and downward
<a name="1923qlink6">for the nose section) which caused added acceleration in their respective
direactions, translating forward momentum into vertical acceleration.</a>

<p>
<a name="1923qlink7">The reason why the peices only had a 400 mph velocity when they hit</a> the ocean is
<a name="1923qlink8">because of what is called 'terminal velocity'. This is when the forces of
acceleration (in this case gravity) are exactly counterbalanced</a> by the forces of
<a name="1923qlink9">aerodynamic drag, thus preventing any additional speed gains.</a> The human body has a
<a name="1923qlink10">terminal velocity when sky diving of around 125 mph in a prone position,</a> and over
<a name="1923qlink11">200 mph in a dive. Now, at 400 mph, assuming that aerodynamic forces</a> cause a pitch
<a name="1923qlink12">over and momentum translation in 5 seconds (not unheard of and similar</a> to a 6g
<a name="1923qlink13">turn in a fighter plane, which, considering the new angle of attack the nose
seciton had to its forward velocity, is likely, then the nose</a> section would have
<a name="1923qlink14">dropped 6.6 miles in one minute traveling at a terminal velocity</a> of 400 mph (which
<a name="1923qlink15">is about 3 miles in 24 seconds). The CIA simulation probably refers</a> to the nose
<a name="1923qlink16">section hitting the ocean, although it is not totally inconsistent</a> if dropped from
<a name="1923qlink17">17000 feet.

<p>
Dropping from 17000 feet from a total stall you have:
S=(32ft/s)*(29^2)/2=13,456 feet.
<br>
This almost exactly matches the nose section trajectory.</a> The additional 350 feet
<a name="1923qlink18">of altitude would have been bridged due to velocity translation</a> by airfoil effects
<a name="1923qlink19">being added to the acceleration profile. So the nose section hit</a> the ocean at 29
seconds.

<p>
<a name="1923qlink20">I suggest that you seek out a written timeline from the CIA</a> of this analysis. I
<a name="1923qlink21">think you will find that what I say is true and that the rear section</a> hit a little
later.
