  IAN: Also firearm ownership is a hedge against 
  totalitarianism and the atrocities associated
  with it. The majority who assume that the Govt
  is too kind to perpetrate atrocities are woefully
</a>
  uninformed and naive! My brief research into the 
  issue of the government exposing U.S. civilian 
  populations to harmful chemicals and biological
  agents has turned up very disturbing facts. The
  U.S. Govt has sprayed contagious pathogens over
  HUNDREDS of populated ares in the U.S., according
  to Dr. Leonard A. Cole of Rutgers University, an 
  expert on biological and chemical warfare issues.

<p>
  Read Dr. Cole's testimony before the U.S. Senate:
  <a href="http://personalpages.tds.net/~kknowlto/openair.htm">http://personalpages.tds.net/~kknowlto/openair.htm</a> 
  many cases of poisoning are cited in a Senate report:
  <a href="http://personalpages.tds.net/~kknowlto/contents.htm">http://personalpages.tds.net/~kknowlto/contents.htm</a> 
  which has errant information about a key U.S. Code.

<p>
  Using entire civil populations as massive guineapig
   farms is an atrocity that our government has
  perpetrated on it's own people hundreds of times!
  Who in their right mind would ever trust these 
  people? Yet those who do not trust the masspoisoners
   are condemned as "paranoid kooks."
<br>
  It has to make you wonder who's really doing 
  the thinking for the masses? Their poisoners!
  When the Govt owns the people's minds, it owns
  the people, who serve the will of their poisoners.

<p>
  Perhaps the widespread poisonings act as a low-level
  cull of the old to minimize Social-Security payments.
