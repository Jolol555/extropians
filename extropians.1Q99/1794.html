I think your right Mike.  But also consider that there are plenty of very bright
chemists capable of making something really nasty themselves - like Sarin Gas -
the stuff used in the Tokyo subway incident.<a name="1813qlink1">  One cc. of pure Sarin in aerosol
form could easily kill a medium sized city.</a>  If one of these chemists or his
associates call's up the big-bad-boys-of-martial-law and tells them that they
either return the power back to the people or face continued and random sarin gas
attacks in vital areas, you'd quickly get a stalemate situation.

<p>
When you have large amounts of military personnel wandering the streets</a> never
knowing whether a Sarin gas attack could happen anytime, it will do much to
disrupt morale and the cohesiveness of a martial law regime.
