Sasha Chislenko and his friend Vanessa came up to visit this weekend, and last
night we rented the movie Gattaca, which I had not seen before. I recall some talk
a while back on the list about it, mostly concern with the Big Brotherly aspects of
the police investigating the murder in the movie, sucking up DNA evidence
everywhere. However, I found that the most important part of the movie, which was
incredibly uplifting, was the story of Vincent, who exceeded the limits imposed by
his supposed genetic destiny and society, and that he was able through his example,
to teach those around him about what true potential is all about.
