Hi,

<p>
<a name="1267qlink1"><a name="1261qlink1">Have any of you seen research on the long term effects of exposure to
ubiquitous environmental factors on longevity?</a>

<p>
For instance,

<p>
<a name="1243qlink1">What is the long term effect if any of rubbing cleansers (soap)</a> on your
<a name="1261qlink2">skin. Is there subtle penetration past the skin barrier? If so,</a> does the
</a>
<a name="1261qlink3"><a name="1243qlink2">body react defensively? Does the continual, daily reduction</a> of oils and
<a name="1261qlink4">changing of Ph levels cause the body to go on a long term homeostatis
maintaining sojourn that over time causes difficult</a> to identify systemic, ie
</a>
<a name="1261qlink5">autoimmune effects? To test my question, I have been avoiding</a> the use of
<a name="1261qlink6">soap while showering. Since I'm a gold collar worker, there</a> is no grime in
<a name="1261qlink7">this. I know, I know - you're all glad email is non-olfactory ;-) But
truthfully I have not "sensed" any actual difference in odor,</a> cleanliness or
<a name="1261qlink8">other well being issues, nor have folks been avoiding me</a> that I can detect.
<a name="1261qlink9">I have been changing clothes more frequently as a social precaution.</a> Test
<a name="1261qlink10">has been proceeding for one week.

<p>
What if any is the long term effect of detergent residues</a> and dry cleaning
<a name="1261qlink11">chemical residues on clothing?

<p>
What is the long term effect of sleeping on billions of dust mites and
inhaling their feces on our autoimmune systems? Does</a> a continual battle with
<a name="1261qlink12">these allergens eventually cause early flame out of immune production
systems due to limits (ie Hayflick)? Does the immune</a> regulatory system get
<a name="1261qlink13">tired of the whole thing, and decide the simplest way to fix</a> the problem is
<a name="1261qlink14">to stop fighting the allergen, and self destruct?

<p>
Has anyone ever done a test for dust mite and mite</a> allergen concentrations
<a name="1261qlink15">in human clothing? other parasites?

<p>
Much of the commentary and conjecture of the list, and my own areas of
interest have been related to nutrition, and genetic/endochrin
interventions. However, perhaps some of these proactive efforts are
necessitated because of lifelong, habituations which have</a> outlived their
<a name="1261qlink16">usefulness - which if identified, and modified/replaced/</a>eliminated might
<a name="1261qlink17">provide elimination of causes.

<p>
<a name="1243qlink3">I think cran is an example of the above. By practicing CRAN, I have
eliminated many ills and pains of my body due to purely Biomechanical
improvements...ie my upper - inner thighs no longer rub</a> together whenever I
</a>
<a name="1261qlink18"><a name="1243qlink4">walk...thus, my stride is straighter, thus, I am not over-rotating my lower
</a>
</a>
<a name="1261qlink19"><a name="1243qlink5">joints extremities, and am not overpronating my feet to counteract</a> the shock
</a>
<a name="1261qlink20"><a name="1243qlink6">of extra weight. Thus I have less pain, feel better, and love</a> life more.
</a>

<p>
<a name="1261qlink21">No....seriously,
<br>
