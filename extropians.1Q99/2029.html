&gt; I think you mix up things a bit. If I jump into my spaceship and blast
&gt; off from Earth (I have an urgent meeting at Aldebaran) with a constant
&gt; acceleration (as measured with an accelerometer onboard) you will see
&gt; my ship recede with a speed (as measured from Earth, for example by
&gt; observing the rate I pass regular milestones along my way) that
&gt; initially increases linearly with time, but gradually the increase
&gt; slows down and after a long while I appear to move near c. No FTL
&gt; there.
&gt;
&gt; Properly speaking the ship is in no inertial frame - it is defined as
&gt; a frame of reference experiencing no accelerations - but it is
&gt; possible to speak of instantaneous inertial frames for each
&gt; moment. However, in neither the ship frames or the Earth's frame is
&gt; anything seen moving beyond c.

<p>
Okay, I take your point.

<p>
I'm not actually talking about ftl in the strict interpretation of the
term.
<br>
I think the main point of disagreement is the time dilation effect and
whether it is possible to overcome it.

<p>
The fact that a ship can blast around the galaxy in within the crews
lifetime is not much use to anyone else if they cannot communicate any
information faster than a direct light signal.

which contain a lot of very interesting ideas about ftl travel and
communication.
