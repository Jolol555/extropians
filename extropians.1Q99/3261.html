Well, those are the non-sentient ones, that's the point... :-)

<p>
Exactly.  Potentially sentient entities should have potential rights,
real entities-real rights.  I could claim that every fertile woman who
passes by is a potential for carrying my sentient offspring, and she
would commit a crime if she refuses to do everything possible to bring
this potentiality into existence.

<p>
Of course, a fetus is less intelligent, sensitive, purposeful, coordinated,
etc. than a cat or even a frog.   It takes a real idiot to go against all
reason and claim that this blob of flesh that can later turn into a sentient
human if given proper food and education (*everything* can be turned into
a sentient human with proper addition of matter and knowledge) is somehow
"sacred" just because of this fact or because it looks somewhat like a human.</a>

<a name="3267qlink5"><a name="3266qlink1">But then, of course, a newborn baby is also inferior to a cat, so rationally,
getting rid of them is ethically no worse than killing a cow - right?
And then, there are mentally retarded folk who will never turn into anything
sentient...   But that's really different... right?</a></a>
