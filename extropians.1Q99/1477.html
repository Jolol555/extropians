<a href="1470.html#1477qlink1">&gt;max m, i think you said you are an advertising executive?</a><br>

<p>
Yeah you could say that, but my main focus is in "new media", cd-rom,
internet, strategic information design etc.
A large subbranch in my field is 1 to 1 (direct) marketing which the net is
made for (No I don't mean spam :-) ).

<p>
<a href="1470.html#1477qlink2">&gt;do you get the same commercials out there in denmark?  do</a><br>
<i>&gt;you study american superbowl ads?  spike</i><br>

<p>
No and yes. American commercials ususally don't work here in Denmark. The
target audience is very different. Some commercials are use here though, but
mostly the total mainstream ones by the multinationals: Lever, Proctor &amp;
Gamble etc. Even though they are most often rerecorded with Danish actors.

<p>
We do study the US commercials but we cannot use them for much. A TV
commercial is only a part of a much bigger campaign, and must be specifially
designed for that campaign. They have to enhance a message and that message
is decided by: what we want to tell, why we want to tell it, to whom we want
to tell it and how we want to tell it. Therefore there cannot be much reuse
in commercials crossing different cultures.

<p>
There is also legal issues involved in the commercials. Many things that are
legal to use in US commercials are illegal in DK and vice versa.

<p>
What we do study vigirously is the american campaigns, the methods and the
ideas behind them. This is interresting and can be used to great effect
everywhere. There are some good books on the subject. At the time I
especially like one called "Coopetition".

<p>
American culture do have a strong influence on Danish culture though, but
i'll bet you that American Football will never be popular in Denmark. This
was the first superbowl to be shown live in Denmark, but only because the
Danish kicker Morten Andersen??? was on the side of the Falcons.

<p>
It is a strange fragmented game that stops and starts all the time. A bit
<a name="1519qlink1">like Coitus Interuptus :-)

<p>
Soccer is much more fun to watch ;-)
