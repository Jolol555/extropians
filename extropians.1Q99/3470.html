<i>&gt;&gt; This was once a fine quote, which has forever been tainted, sullied and spoiled by its discovery on the t-shirt of the "Turner Diaries" loving Timothy McVeigh when he was apprehended fleeing the scene of his Oklahoma City bombing, much as a fine archaic sun symbol, the swasticka, has been stained beyond recovery with the blood of six million Jews killed under its banner by Hitler's Reich.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tim McVeighs crime was NOT that he bombed the building. Any government building is a legitimate military target for a dissident insurgency group under the Laws of War. &gt;</i><br>
<a name="3472qlink1">The few crazed people who perpetrated this act of domestic jihad are no more to be honored by the title of "dissident insurgency group" than were Bob Mathews and his group (actually calling themselves "The Order", and inspired by the same demonic Turner Diaries) who heisted banks and killed jewish personalities in the '70's and '80's.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<br>
What was his crime was in setting the bomb off when he KNEW there were people in the building who are classified by the Red Cross, the Laws of War, and by the UCMJ as non-combatants, i.e. the children in the day care center and
<br>
<a href="3443.html#3470qlink2">&gt;the civilians using the government services in the building. In this context, what he did was a war crime that was not very much worse than the US Marine pilot who sliced through the cable for that gondola in Italy. The pilot had a jury biased in his favor and the backing of the government who wanted an acquittal, while Tim McVeigh had a judge who refused the defense to call witnesses which</a><br>
<i>&gt;would expose the government's complicity in staging the event.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3472qlink3">(1) I think the pilot should have been convicted, and pilot instructors from Pensacola, Florida, the "cradle of Naval Aviation", have written to the local newspaper expressing their incomprehension and dismay at the verdict, which was an example of why the military fraternity should never be allowed to hold court over its errant frat boys. (2) The pilot did not intend to kill the people in the gondola; it was obviously a reckless hotdogging accident, whereas McVeigh meant to kill as many people as possible. (3) Twenty died in the gondola; 169 died in the federal building.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3443.html#3470qlink3">&gt;McVeigh was overwrought by the slaughter of the Koresh families by the government (for which nobody has yet been convicted, not to mention being sentenced to death), and wanted to exact eye for an eye revenge. McVeigh was a reserve NCO in the army at the time. An NCO's authority to act and give orders is only delegated to him by his commanding officer. Only a commissioned officer (or the</a><br>
<i>&gt;congress that commissions the officer) has the authority to determine what is an enemy of the Constitution, 'foreign or domesitic', and McVeigh knew this.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3472qlink4">So if I'm "overwrought" that the US has, by allowing the interstate highway system to be built and by not banning smoking and the consumption of alcohol, directly contributed to the deaths of millions, I can legitimately bomb the BATF and the Transportation Dep't.?</a>  The original Mad Bomber waged a war against Con Edison for effronteries to his frangible sense of outrage, Ramsi Yousef feels the very existence of the US to be a fatwa-deserving affront to Holy Islam, and Theodore Kaczynski believes that computers specifically, and technology generally, are a cancer devouring the collective soul of Homo Sapiens.  These last two now share the seme prison as McVeigh, and they ALL belong there.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3443.html#3470qlink4">&gt;If he in fact did have a superior in the conspiracy as he claims, who he met with at the Elohim City site (as verified by the government's own witnesses), it seems as though his superior is a West German intelligence agent who works for the FBI, according to what independent invetigators (including some in the media) have concluded. This agent matches the description and sketch of the famous</a><br>
<i>&gt;John Doe #2 that the government now claims is erroneous and non-existent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3472qlink5">This matches perfectly the M.O. of neonazi atrocity and accompanying propaganda: (1) do a terrible thing costing many lives, and (2) claim that the victims did it to themselves to engender sympathy.  Blame the jews for the ovens, the short dress for the rape, the blacks for slavery, and the government for ALL terrorist attacks, whether committed by or against them.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3443.html#3470qlink5">&gt;Rather than condemning individuals who thought they were defending our nation, but who have been brought to justice, how about directing your ire at a government that commits such atrocities as the Ruby Ridge ambush/standoff, and the Koresh family massacre. Why has no government agent been demoted, fired or convicted for these acts? In fact, all agents involved in these acts have been</a><br>
<i>&gt;promoted and praised for their actions. Too bad Ian Goddard isn't focusing his energies on this situation. I think he'd find much more real evidence.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3487qlink2"><a name="3487qlink1"><a name="3472qlink2">I believe that judicial action should be taken against the Ruby Ridge sniper,</a> but in the case of Davis Koresh, he wes malignantly evil and his followers were brainless and sick sheep, handing their children over to be molested. That bigamous pederast "preacher" and his flock just did a Jim Jones with flaming koolaid.  And what nation was he defending?  He hated the "Great Satan" as much as Ramzi Yousef did (and as much as Tim McVeigh hated what he conceives of as "ZOG").</a>
