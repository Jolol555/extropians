<p>
Next we can look for a genetically engineered virus which will kill
those individuals who have trace amounts of illegal drugs in their
systems.  Talk about ending the "War on Drugs"!!  

<p>
I can't remember his name, but the guy that was the chief of Police in
LA during (or maybe just before - a white guy) the Rodney King riots
was quoted as saying something to the effect that drug users should be
"taken behind a barn and shot."  A legislator in Mississippi has
suggested that anyone caught with illegal drugs be given the choice of
which of his limbs should be sawed off.  And in Indiana, the state
legislature is considering mandatory life sentences for certain drug
offenders - a longer sentence than most murders, all rapists and all
child molesters!!

<p>
What the hell is wrong with this country?????????
