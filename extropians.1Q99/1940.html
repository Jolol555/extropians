<i>&gt; &gt;political/individual) definition mix up that you point to has me</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;perplexed.</i><br>

<p>
Politics is the means by which individuals relate with other individuals in a
society of any size, be it a family, tribe, city, state, nation or world.
Without the individual, society does not exist, yet the individual can exist
just fine without society. The individual is the indivisible, basic, essential
unit of any polity, therefore it follows that the means by which individuals
relate to each other (politics) is entirely dependent on those individuals, not
on the group as a whole. The whole 'group' is a fiction created by the
individuals to improve the means by which individuals relate to one another. It
can be dissolved at any time by the individuals, and individual members are
able to dissasociate themselves from the group at any time they choose, and may
associate with any single member of the group they choose to without the
permission of other members of the group, unless the member of the group being
associated with has previously agreed and continues to agree, to no associate
with individuals that are not members of the group.

<p>
Statist group thinking is what is the real doublethink. It is merely a state of
the individual(s) who have attained control over the majority or all of the
other members of the group such that they speak as if speaking for the group,
which is where the ludicrous "We" that royal sovereigns use comes from to refer
to themselves, since they con the rest are merely unthinking members of the
whole. Statism is merely primitive borganistic hive mentality, not true
transhumanism. Statism is post-humanism, anti-humanism, as it denigrates the
individual in favor of the group or the state. Since a state or group cannot
exist without individuals as members, then the group or state can have no
inherent rights, only posessing those which the individuals freely agree to
delegate to it.
