<p>
Whoever is applying the decision.  If I see someone torturing an animal for
no good reason, I will treat them in the sameway as I would treat someone
torturing a child for no reason, or torturing a person for no reason.

<p>
There are numerous people who believe that animals have, at the very least,
limited rights - in the same way that children have limited rights.  That
they occupy the planet too and while human's take precedence (in most
peoples opinions), they do not take ultimate precedence.
