It's enough for the AI to make the choice, but "most correct to the AI" is
not the same as "most correct for me" if subjective meaning is true.  And
contrary to your earlier claims, I DO have goals with value if subjective
value is true, and those values may indeed be contrary to the AIs values.

<a name="3561qlink1">Again, it seems to me that if subjective meaning is true then I can and
should oppose building a seed-AI like yours until I, myself, am some kind
of a power.  What's wrong with this argument?  It seems like this argument,
if true, annihilates your theory about the interim meaning of life.</a>
