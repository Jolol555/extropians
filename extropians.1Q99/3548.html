<p>
Actually, what I said was that we should stick with limited, constitutional
government because we can build one that will work fairly well.  I am not in
favor of an anarcho-capitalist system of government because we have no idea
how it will really behave, and the potential for catastrophic problems seems
large.

<p>
Now, I know you probably think 'anarcho-capitalist government' is an
oxymoron, but it isn't.  Any entity that makes and enforces laws is a
government.  A PPA is simply a weak government with completely uncontrolled
borders.  If the police and the courts are run by different companies, then
the whole system is a government (albeit an even weaker one).  The only way
you can be free of government is to have pure anarchy - and then you are
living in a Hobbesian state of nature, from which governments will
inevitably arise.

<p>
So, my preference is for a single weak government that can be constrained
with well-understood tools.  I don't favor anarcho-capitalist schemes
because I do not believe that the market is capable of constraining
violence, and I expect that police corporations of any kind would simply
grow into a new kind of police state.

<p>
<a href="3546.html#3548qlink2">&gt; See, you look on nukes as a problem and universal surveillance or brain</a><br>

<i>&gt; get their freedom. Then you're suprised that people think you're more</i><br>
<i>&gt; interested in control and safety than freedom.</i><br>

<p>
I see cheap nukes as a problem because all they are really good for is
killing millions of innocent civilians.  I see universal surveillance and
mind control as monstrosities that oppressive states will happily embrace as
soon as they are feasible.  I mentioned them because I believe in dealing
with the world as it really is, not as I wish it to be.

<p>
You may be willing to risk your life on a long list of breezy assumptions
about how everything is bound to go your way.  Feel free.  I think your
experiment will end in disaster, but you are more than welcome to give it a
try.

<p>
Meanwhile, my goal is a system that will deliver almost exactly the same
degree of freedom as yours, without anything like the same potential for
catastrophe.  I fail to see what is supposed to be so terrible about that.
