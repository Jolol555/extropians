What counts here is not whether you were<a name="1521qlink1"> interested or not but rather
</a>
whether you solicited the information.  If you receive the spam and do
not want to pursue it through the various complaint processes that is
OK for you.

<p>
OPT-IN is the only model that will work.  OPT-OUT will guarantee a
never-ending spew of "this is a one time mailing" spam.  And you can
bet that it will NOT be the only time that the spammers send you those
"one time mailings."  They have already demonstrated their lack of
ethics by stealing from you in order to advertise to you.  They will
just claim "that is the only one I sent; someone else must have sent
those other ones."

<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Really?  Then I guess I should go to prison.  Recently I saw a</i><br>
reference
<br>
<a href="1464.html#1485qlink7">&gt; &gt; to an interesting-sounding crypto paper published earlier this</a><br>
year,
<br>
<a href="1464.html#1485qlink8">&gt; &gt; but I couldn't find the paper on the web.  I sent unsolicited</a><br>
email to
<br>
<a href="1464.html#1485qlink9">&gt; &gt; the author asking if he would mind sending me a copy.  He did not</a><br>
know
<br>
<a href="1464.html#1485qlink10">&gt; &gt; me, he has never indicated any interest in knowing me or anyone</a><br>
like me,
<br>
<a href="1464.html#1485qlink11">&gt; &gt; or my company, or my product, or my customer's products.  From</a><br>
what you
<br>
<a href="1464.html#1485qlink12">&gt; &gt; say, what I did is illegal and I should go to prison.</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; No doubt many more people will end up in the same boat if we</i><br>
continue to
<br>
<a href="1464.html#1485qlink13">&gt; &gt; criminalize behavior as some people are suggesting.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Since you were interested in his product, it is obviously not an</i><br>
offense. Get a
<br>
<i>&gt; clue.</i><br>

<p>
So it is OK because I (the sender) was interested in his (the
recipient)
<br>
product.  Above, you indicated that it was necessary that the
recipient
<br>
be interested in the sender's product.  You are changing the rules as
we
<br>
speak.

<p>
Spammers are interested in my product - in the money that is in my
wallet.
<br>
By your new reasoning, their spam is OK.  I don't think this is what
you
<br>
mean to imply.

<p>
The point is, there is unsolicited email which the recipient is happy
to
<br>
receive, and there is unsolicited email which he is not happy to
receive.
<br>
People are trying to propose rules by which the sender should know
which
<br>
of the two categories his email will fall into.

<p>
Throwing people in jail because they misjudged the happiness of the
recipient is not a good way to solve this problem.
