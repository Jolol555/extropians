After thinking this over, I realized the problem is in separating the
kernel of truth from the usual news agency clutter.  Whereas I
would not rule out random goofing with a satellite by sending spurious
signals, the way it was originally reported was that miscreants
had kidnapped the system, changed its course (?) and were holding
it for ransom. {8^D   To do such a thing would be far more difficult
than opening a bank vault by throwing banannas at it. spike
