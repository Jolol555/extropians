  IAN: Well stated! I see the extropian meme
  as inherently antithetical to death and acts 
  of harm &amp; aggression against sentient beings,
  with the awareness that there are inherently 
  conflicts between human and nonhuman claims, 
  but the goal is to zero-out harm to others.

  can stop stepping on the little guys on Earth.
