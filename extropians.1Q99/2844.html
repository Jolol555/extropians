<p>
<a name="2894qlink1">Although not an anarchist myself, I completely agree with Anthony Garcia's
<br>
"Philippic From the Old School", both for its spirit and its content. I also<br>
consider myself an "old school Extropian", considering</a> the recent rejection of
<a name="2894qlink2">libertarianism (i.e. minarchism in my case) a blatant illustration of the
disintegration of the principles of the movement.</a>

<p>
<a name="2894qlink3">But does extropianism really have *any* principles?

<p>
The best way to answer this question is look at how "extropianism"</a> is defined,
<a name="2894qlink4">which requires combining the three definitions that open version 3.0</a> of the
Principles.

<p>
<a name="2894qlink5">This gives us:

<p>
<a href="1314.html#2844qlink1">"Extropianism is the evolving transhumanist philosophy of those who seek to</a><br>
increase the extent of a system's intelligence, information, order, vitality,
and capacity for improvement."</a>

<p>
<a name="2894qlink6">In other words, this philosophy is defined as whatever set of ideas is
currently held</a> by the people who seek to increase a very vague set of
characteristics of an undefined "system".

<p>
<a name="2894qlink7">"Extropy" is just a name that "feels good" to science graduates who have<br>
learned to associate its alleged opposite, "entropy", with chaos and the
<br>
"heat-death" of the universe.<br>

<p>
But how is it defined? By enumeration, which is an invalid form</a> of definition.
<a name="2894qlink8">I cannot define the concept "animal" by saying; "animals are horses, cats</a> and
<a name="2894qlink9">fish", which is roughly the epistemological status of the definition of
</a><br>
"extropy".<br>

<p>
<a name="2894qlink10">This is not logical nit-picking, as I know some members of this</a> group consider
<a name="2894qlink11">logic a tyrannical imposition on their minds (fine for you, I share Rand's
contempt for those who would reject the tyranny of reality),</a> and most are
infatuated with "fuzzy logic". The practical consequences of this invalid
definition are extremely severe.

<p>
<a name="2894qlink12">For instance: If I classify the books in my library by colour, I have
increased the order of a system, which makes my act "good" by extropian
standards.</a> If I download all sorts of crap from the Internet and store it on
<a name="2894qlink13">my computer, I have increased my computer's</a> information- another instance of
an "extropian" action. And didn't Hitler increase the "order" of the political
system of Germany?

<p>
<a name="2894qlink14"><a name="2847qlink1">Moreover, the various "ingredients" of extropy contradict one another. Take
order and capacity for improvement, for instance. Doesn't Stuart</a> Kaufman argue
<a name="2894qlink15">that evolution takes place in areas where a balance between order and chaos
can be found, and that extremes of chaos and order prevent it? Well then, it
is impossible to maximize both order and capacity for improvement.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2894qlink16"><a name="2847qlink2">"Extropy" is therefore an invalid, self-contradictory concept.</a> This is why the<br>
<a name="2894qlink17">philosophy will soon dissolve in the kind of nonsense that has almost always
been coalescing around it, and why there's no way we can save it from such
trash.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2894qlink18">Extropy is a philosophy that seeks "more" of a undefined "something".</a> This is
<a name="2894qlink19">all the irony of the principle of self-transformation (into what? a toad?)</a> and
<a name="2894qlink20">of Max More's own nickname (more of what? dumbness?).</a>

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Jean-Francois Virey.
