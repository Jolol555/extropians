I'm new to this "extropian zone" and I have no idea if I'm going about 
interjecting to this conversation correctly, but here goes nothing!

Dear Natasha, this isn't so much an objection to your view(personally 
I'm not vegetarian); rather to possibly help inform.  I lived all my 
life on a farm and see where my experience may contribute to this 
dialoge.

<p>
<a name="0463qlink1">I don't know a percise percentage, but I'd say only about half(for sake 
of argument) of the cow population's function is for diary purposes.  So 
that leaves the other half to "deal" with.  My second observation is 
that I agree, It would be nice spare the "post-prime" cows, for 
nostalgia; etc., but on the other hand, this would be INCREDIBLY 
</a>EXPENSIVE!  If it were only one or two cows, a person might be able to 
wing it.  But the vast majority of farms harbor, I don't know, maybe 50+ 
cows.  The feed and medical burdens would, financially, be too much for 
anyone.  Farmers already have enough trouble making ends meet.  Notice  
the disclaimer on news/financial reports, when the average salary for 
americans is displayed; it's only for "NON-FARM PAYROLLS."

<p>
<a name="0463qlink2">Well, I hope that was helpful.</a>  Again, I'm not in the least critisizing 
you; just trying to help.

<p>
Eric
