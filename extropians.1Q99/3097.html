Or Senator John McCain, also a POW, and also a Navy pilot.

<p>
The only reason I see for the war in Vietnam as a plausible reason is this:
Failing to oppose communism in ANY theater during the cold war tended to
encourage them to further expansionism. John Von Neumann only knows where we
would be if we did not maintain such a policy for most of the cold war.As for
policy conducting the war, the worst mistake, which caused more deaths than
anything, was the cowardly and traitorous micromanagement and burdensome rules
of engagement that the Johnson administration used in conducting the war (Nixon
was not innocent of this either).

<i>&gt; &gt;had the courage to act on this knowledge, at a time when cultural</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;influences worked almost overwhelmingly against them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nonsense, Jane Fonda is a traitor, not a hero. Those who opposed</i><br>

You know, Tokyo Rose served time as a war criminal, as did her Nazi counterpart.
Here, Hanoi Jane not only gets the approbation of the liberals, but marries Ted
Turner, makes hundreds of millions with her workout videos in the capitalist
system she betrayed. I applaud those who stayed here and opposed the war. Those
who went and gave succor to the enemy deserve no respect. I also agree it was a
stupid war to get involved in for the purposes we did. We should have backed Ho
Chi Minh after WWII when he asked us.

<p>
<a href="3079.html#3097qlink4">&gt; Someone asked about extropian relevance. I feel it has to do with</a><br>
<i>&gt; personnel responsibility. I enlisted because that is what I felt</i><br>
<i>&gt; was right. I have always opposed the draft and cannot figure out</i><br>
<i>&gt; how it can exist in a so-called democracy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The hypocrisy that some were forced to serve while others (based</i><br>
<i>&gt; mostly on economics) were given a pass is something that should</i><br>
<i>&gt; never again be permitted.</i><br>

<p>
Its due to the concept of the militia and the citizen soldier. My own
anti-statist views notwithstanding, the idea that you could stay completely out
of a war effort simply by declaring yourself a concientious objector is false.
It simply puts you into a non-combatant medical billet. If those who were
opposed to the war were so philosophically opposed, why did they not register
themselves as  Concientious Objectors, as they were legally allowed to avoid
combat duty? There were hundreds of times more people protesting than who
actually registered as CO's. That indicates to me a high level of moral
cowardice. They were too chicken to be publicly known as CO's.

<p>
Remember the old story of Roman matrons to their sons: "Come home with your
shield, or on it."

<p>
On the subject of selectivity, well, the military can accept or deny anyone it
wants to. Just because you are eligible to be drafted does not mean they must
take you. They could decide in what capacity you could best serve the country.
If you were a loner genius, they certainly don't want you in a combat platoon
where teamwork and dumb obedience to orders is most important.

<p>
You also should not denigrate those who chose to be officers. A higher
percentage of officers who served in the region died than enlisted men, and in
the Air Force and Navy, unless you were in the SEALs or UDTs, you usually only
did die if you were an officer pilot, unless you got ambushed during R&amp;R in
Saigon.
