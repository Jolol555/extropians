Most of us here categorically reject the idea that anything we do as
human beings has any root in anything outside the realm of the physical
universe. We embrace the classical liberal idea that science is the
single best tool capable of studying, testing, and explaining any
phenomenon that exists in this universe or within our minds. We also
rely on the scientific method as a means of differentiating between real
phenomena of the greater universe, and phenomena which are merely the
creation of our mind's inner perceptions.

<p>
Because of this, we feel that any uploading of human minds will
reproduce the qualities of the human mind that are popularly known as
'intuitional' and 'spiritual', but at present are not completely
explained by the scientific method, in the constructs which we upload
minds to.
