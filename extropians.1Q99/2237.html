<p>
Even the case of children is not so clear-cut.  While we place a very
large amount of power in the hands of parents, we also place limits;
correctly, if you ask me.  You can pollute your children's minds all you
want with nonsense, but you can't beat them, force them to work, neglect
their physical needs for food and shelter, etc.  Some exceptions are
made even there for religious nuts: allowing parents to deny essential
medical care or permanently lop off perfectly healthy parts of their
genitalia for no legitimate reason (a barbarism we will outgrow
eventually, I'm sure), but there are still limits (for example, you
can only mutilate your child's genitalia in the US if it's a boy).

<p>
It is a legitimate concern what physical or "mental" limits should be
placed on sentient beings we create.  It does reflect upon us how we
treat those over whom we have power.

<p>
Rights are a consequence of autonomy: we grant them to adults so that
they can exercise their autonomy as effectively as possible without
interfering with others or suffering interference from others.  We grant
some limited rights to children so as to encourage their development
into fully autonomous beings.  If we would think it unconscionable to
make permanent physical modifications to a child that would restrict
its future autonomy (and therefore its future rights), then we should
have the same judgment for doing it to an AI.
