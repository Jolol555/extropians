<a name="3773qlink1">Something I find interesting is the idea that in an experiment, there's no
such thing as a "control" simply because the experimenter has an affect on
the entire experiment. There's no such thing as "separateness" - it's all
part of the way we think about things that brings about "categories".</a>

<i>&gt;Well, he certainly doesn't know much about neurobiology. We get</i><br>
<i>&gt;angry via synaptic transmissions, which happen in a small number of</i><br>
<i>&gt;milliseconds, just as predicted by physics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Whole-body hormonal adrenal events are predicted to require up to</i><br>
<i>&gt;several minutes and that turns out to be correct too.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;           Nature's attempted debunking exercise failed to find</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;           evidence of fraud, but concluded that Benveniste's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;           research was essentially unreproducible, a claim he</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;           has always denied. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Failed to find evidence of fraud" is an *extremely* charitable way</i><br>
<i>&gt;of putting it.  Randi switched some of the bottles without telling</i><br>
<i>&gt;Beneviste.  The bottles that *had* been treated - but that Beneviste</i><br>
<i>&gt;thought hadn't - showed no reaction.  The bottles that *had not* </i><br>
<i>&gt;been treated - but that Beneviste thought had - had a reaction!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Clearly the effect was quite bogus, and that's certainly evidence</i><br>
<i>&gt;for fraud.  Fraud wasn't *proved*, because Beneviste could be a </i><br>
<i>&gt;wishful incompetent.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So now somebody whose experiments are, intentionally or unintentionally,</i><br>
<i>&gt;fudged, has found a new implausible effect which solves a "problem"</i><br>
<i>&gt;which actually doesn't exist.  Pardon me if I'm not impressed.</i><br>
