<p>
It was only the Auckland grid, and it failed because some of the main power
lines into the city went down. There was still some power available through
the other lines, but not much.

<p>
<a name="1750qlink1">Because anything that the Aucklanders needed could be shipped in from the
rest of New Zealand, which had power, or Australia, which had power. If
power goes down in most of the world (unlikely, but possible), or if power
goes down in some places and airports and rail go down and highways are
blocked with cars and trucks, you can't do that. I don't think Y2K will
get that bad in most places, but probably will in some.</a>

<p>
Only one problem with that... many of the military's biggest Y2K problems
are in the command and information systems. This is one reason why the
National Guard are going to be testing callout with good old low-tech
shortwave radios later this year.</a>

<p>
Problem: business-sized generators are in short supply, and most people
can't store enough gas at home to run a smaller generator for long. Not 
to mention that if we do get into a roving hordes situation people would 
be fools to run generators and attract them. I'm thinking about buying
one, but it would be primarily as a useful gadget for film-making, not
for Y2K alone.
