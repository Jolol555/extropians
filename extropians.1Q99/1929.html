<a name="1938qlink1">I found the following on James T. Hogan's (the science fiction author)
website.  I'm kinda gratified that he addresses a subject that I brought up
(and was subsequently shot down on) some months ago.  However...his questions
are intriquing...and he's NOT just a truckdriver.</a>

EARLY EARTH Posted May 9, 1997

<p>
In connection with this, I've come across some fascinating accounts in various
sources showing that dinosaurs were simply impossible. Weight scales up as the
cube of size, but strength only as the square. At dinosaur size, even an
Olympic power-lifting champion wouldn't be able to stand--and they're all
muscle, whereas dinosaurs were practically all digestive system. Dinosaurs
don't show any evidence of possessing the specially adapted high-pressure
blood circuits that giraffes need to supply the head--even with necks 2-3
times longer. Suggestions that they carried their heads low run into
impossible stresses exerted by the leverage at the base. Aqueous environments
don't fit with the wear on the teeth, which was caused by hard, dry
vegetation, not soggy marine stuff; and they left tracks and footprints. One
school of interpretation concludes Earth must have been a lower-gravity place
back then. But how could that be? More in this--sources, comments,
suggestions--welcome.
