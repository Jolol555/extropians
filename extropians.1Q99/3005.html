I concur. This is the sort of statement that I was looking for in joining the
list  2.5 years ago and recently joining ExI. I want to be an activist, not a
diversity sensitivity trainer.

On the rainforests bit, Eli, how about:

<p>
We will completely REBUILD the rainforests ANYWAY and bring back every species
made extinct by man, just to SPITE the environmentalists who said it couldn't be
done with TECHNOLOGY, and  for trying to outlaw every form of technology more
advanced than AGRICULTURE, which is the real ecology killer. The rainforests
will become HUNTING preserves for humans to practice the ceremony of the HUNT to
retain contact with their roots....
