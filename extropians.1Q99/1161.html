No, no, and, uh, no.

So the questions would seem to be:


<OL>
  <li>  Are people buying them because of the advertising or the "tradition"
  <li>  Just how much of people's budget consist of such items, rather than
   those they really want?

<a name="1171qlink1">I'd certainly agree that there are such traditions which many people follow,
but I think that it's a different issue; people buy diamond engagement rings
-- if they do, most people I know didn't want to spend that kind of money
on something that isn't really useful -- because they're expected to, not
<a name="1174qlink1">because they see an ad on TV and think 'oh, I think I'll buy a diamond
engagement ring today'. Galbraith's theory seems to be the latter; we see
an ad on TV and follow the meme to go out and buy a diamond engagement

Kids see toys advertised on TV and immediately want them. Most adults -- 
with the exception of the few people I know who really have more money
than sense -- don't. Tradition seems to be a different issue; buying the
diamond engagement ring when you get engaged serves a purpose, whether or
not that purpose was originally created by advertising.
