I remember talking about Y2K bugs back in the late 80s. Doesn't mean that
any of them were fixed. The Swedes didn't discover until late last year
that their nuclear stations would all fail in 1999; luckily they could
just switch the date back 'til 1990 and it all continued to work.

Stop the food supply to the major cities for three days and the world will 
be a very different place.

The basic point is that at some level of failure it becomes impossible to
fix, because of lack of supplies and because those who could fix it will
bug out rather than stay and work on the problem. The question is, will we
get to that level? I don't think we will in the West on a national or global 
level, but probably will on a small scale in various areas.
