Agreeing to a law isn't just about agreeing to some words.  It's also about
agreeing to a process to adjudicate disputes.  If people accepted the U.S.
constitution as contraining their property, then they also accepted the 
process the U.S. constitution defined for adjudicating disputes.  That process
has clearly run its course regarding spectrum rights, and the judgement was
for the FCC.  It has even more clearly run its course regarding states rights.

<p>
The same sort of thing is going to happen in the best legal system you can
imagine.  Some people will think some legal decisions should have gone the
other way.  At some point the world ignores those complaints and moves on.
