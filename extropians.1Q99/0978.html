Yes - but...  I wonder about the outliers.  I don't know anyone who's
hyper-rich, but it looks from the outside like a kind of opiate addiction
that sometimes actually *overwhelms* some of the obvious self-maintenance
routines (think of Howard Hughes).  

<p>
And there's another boggle - I don't quite know how to factor it in - due
to each of us currently having only one body to experience stuff through.
Murdoch pere and fils have both been seen lately on TV doing fairly
dangerous things on boats in rough water, playing dangerously with the
other rich kids.  No doubt this is partly advertising and partly Alpha
behaviour, but I imagine it's just a hell of a lot of fun and even when you
could be making another trillion dollars at yr desk sometimes you'd `rather
be sailing'.

Indeed.
