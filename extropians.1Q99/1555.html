<p>
Not necessarily. It would not be hard at all for anonymous remailers to put a
cap on the number of emails that can be sent in a given time period, or that
have identical byte counts or identical subject lines or a limit on the number
of 'cc:' addresses allowed on a message. If they were truly interested in
contributing to a solution they would institute policies like this. Since they
are not, they are colluding.

<p>
At least if they move offshore, there can definitely be some limits put on the
traffic. Note the limits the telcos have put on phone traffic to the Dominican
Republic and other Carribean nations (as well as some African countries)
because of the amount of wire fraud that originates from those countries. I
recall a few years ago that I had to establish a special connection with one of
my manufacturers in St Kitts because AT&amp;T had blocked all calling card calls to
and from that island.
