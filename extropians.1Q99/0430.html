  IAN: The massive hole in that argument is that 
  over 70% of agriculture land is devoted to the 
  production of food for livestock, for meat! So
  the argument you make against vegetarianism is
  in fact properly directed at meat eating. I did
  a detailed report on this years ago and can dig
  it up (plus other research) if that's disputed.
  The stopping of meat eating would reduce the 
  overall use of lands for food production.
  Also, cattle eat 9 lbs of protein for every 1
  lb they yield. Meat eating is a wasteful luxury.
