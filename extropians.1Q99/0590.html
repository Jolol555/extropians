It would also make sense to make it legal for peaceful 
citizens to purchase firearms and carry them concealed.

<p>
If criminals know that a large portion of the populace is armed,
they'll be much less likely to attack members of said populace.

<p>
The problem in Chicago (IMHO) is that the government there has made it
illegal for peaceful citizens to own guns (what's the logic there),
thus making them easy targets for criminals with no interest in law or
peace.

<p>
The government of Chicago is itself to blame for it's problems with
firearms.
