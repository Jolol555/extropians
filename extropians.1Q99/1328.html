  IAN: There's no question that that provision 
  addresses exactly what 1520 obviously lacked,
  and I think your raising it also address the
  idea I was replying to that now only the 
  30-day-notification period is lifted.

<p>
  If you read 1520(a), subsection (c) is also
  well-embedded into it, and there is no way
  for the Secretary of Defence to get around 
  it (that I can find so far). But, as for 
  the President and the rest of the Govt, 
  1520(a) imposses no prohibitions.

<p>
  I'd rather see 1520(a) start for saying that 
  "No agency or member of the U.S. Government, 
  or contracting for same or any entity may..."</a>
  Instead, only one official is restrained.

<a name="1340qlink2">  I think Hal's point was even deeper than I'd
  grasped. I think he was saying that 1520 was 
  not a de facto "legalization," it wasn't saying
  "this is now declared legal." It was more like 
  stepping in the planning room of an on-going 
  project, such that the only reason the law
  was written was to tell the DoD that they 
  have to give a 30-day warning FROM NOW ON.

<p>
  In short, that testing is allowable wasn't
  the point of 1520,  the 30-day notice was.
  Ergo, the mass testing is considered legal.
  That seems to me to be a possible reading.</a>
