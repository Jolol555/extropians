<i>&gt; Tim,</i><br>
<a href="2772.html#2975qlink1">&gt;    I have considered forms of Coventry before, but not with so much</a><br>
<i>&gt; technological infrastructure.  I am worried about the annonymous part of your</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggestion.  There is a reason people have the right to face their accusers.</i><br>

<p>
You need to distinguish a court of law (in which you do have this right)
from the rest of life, in which you don't.

<p>
We none of us have any idea what anyone is saying about us "behind our
backs", as it were, and no legal right too know. I think that is just fine.

<p>
<a href="2772.html#2975qlink2">&gt; How could you be sure you weren't receiving different versions of the same</a><br>
<i>&gt; rumor (which might not even be true),</i><br>

<p>
People who check best will do best. You can hire checkers. People will value
their low rumor-monger scores.

<p>
&gt; how do you guard against some<br>
<a href="2772.html#2975qlink3">&gt; talented hacker doing a hatchet job on an innocent person's reputation?</a><br>
With unhackable encryption. Your reputation will be at least as safe as your
bank account.

<p>
<a href="2772.html#2975qlink4">&gt; Also, is there any time that a person's privacy</a><br>
<i>&gt; is restored to them?</i><br>
You have full privacy at all times. Other people have their knowledge about
you at all times.

<p>
<i>&gt; People are not always the most forgiving, and what if someone</i><br>
<a href="2772.html#2975qlink5">&gt; has truly reformed, how are</a><br>
<i>&gt; they to overcome prejudice based on past status...</i><br>
By justifying it to whomever they wish to trade with. Basically, you just
offer a discount for the first few transactions.

<p>
<i>&gt; Maybe if there were some</i><br>
<a href="2772.html#2975qlink6">&gt; sort of certification process which could add to your datastream any positive</a><br>
<i>&gt; information about this person.</i><br>
It is just a datastream. Certificates of both positive and negative
information flow freely.

<p>
&gt; I think these factors might weigh differently<br>
<a href="2772.html#2975qlink7">&gt; depending on what the offender has done wrong in the past.</a><br>
Each of us will use our own judgement (or purchase the judgments of others)
and make up our own minds.

<p>
&gt; Oh, and who's<br>
<a href="2772.html#2975qlink8">&gt; paying for all this?  Criminal fines, perhaps?</a><br>

<p>
It is free. Band width will be free and people will want to push this
information onto the stream so will do it for free. For-fee layer may evolve
on top of this structure, but the core structure is free, just as speech is
now (literally and metaphorically). That is why I am so hot on
non-interventionist government - to allow these new systems to work.
