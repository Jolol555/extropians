<a name="3450qlink1">If I remember the Laws of Land Warfare correctly, to be considered a
legitimate insurgency and to be afforded the priveledges of a POW, there
must exist a well defined command structure, there must be at least
partial control of some territory, soldiers in combat must wear uniforms
or some other form of identification, and probably several other criteria
I don't remember.  By those criteria, McVeigh is a common criminal who
deserves to hang.</a></a>
