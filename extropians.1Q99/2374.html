I believe it.  I know you can put out a fire with engine starting fluid. {8^D
How are the Boeing guys taking all this?  They must have been
at least as certain as I am that fuel tanks cannot explode, even
assuming wire insulation damage.

<p>
I had a thought today: it would *not* be in Boeing's best interest
if it were found that a missile destroyed FL800.  Reasoning:  if
an arcing wire caused an explosion (or something like that) then
Boeing could treat the problem, by inspecting and replacing
wire harnesses, etc.  But if it became widely known that
stinger missiles (for instance) were in the hands of terrorists
there is not one damn thing we can do about that.  People
would get nervous and use aircraft less, Boeing stock would
drop like... FL800.

<p>
By the way, today I cancelled a business trip to the east coast.
This is all due to the paradigm shift of cryonics.  If one is religious,
it does not matter how one dies.  A plane crash is as good as
a heart attack, better than cancer, etc.  But if one has one of
those bracelets, one is tempted to avoid planes, for one midair
collision can spoil everything.. {8-[   spike
