Ok, I'll do that.

<a href="2102.html#2132qlink2">&gt; However, Max's writing on</a><br>

<p>
I agree with that. This is how I now see it: Huxley introduced the 
term, but he used it for a different (though related) concept 
than the modern one. The concept itself evolved gradually under the 
influence of many people. Ettinger and FM then came up with 
definitions of 'transhuman' that are fairly similar to the ones we 
are using now. Then Max defined, for the first time, the word 
transhumanism in the modern sense. Subsequently, the definitions of 
both 'transhuman' and 'transhumanism' have been refined, but their 
meaning remain basically the ones formulated by Ettinger and FM (for 
'transhuman') and by Max (for 'transhumanism').

<p>
Would it be adequate if I insert the following sentence in the 
Cultural antecedents section?

<p>
"Max More wrote the first definition of the word 'transhumanism' in 
its modern sense."

<p>
BTW, I can't upload anything to the web server at the moment, so it 
may take a couple of days before these modifications will appear 
online.
