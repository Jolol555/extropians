<a name="3289qlink1">Feel free to distinguish your viewpoint from "devil take the hindmost" to a
hostile audience some time.</a> :)

<p>
<a name="3289qlink2"><a href="3253.html#3259qlink1">&gt;I don't think living extropians should squander</a><br>
<i>&gt;the resources of their world on the dead, even if the dead have convinced</i><br>
<i>&gt;some people that they believe in extropy.</i><br>

<p>
Say what? You lost me here, chief. Let's assume that someone has and is
paying for a suspension contract and the associated life insurance policy
or other hunk of money.
<br>
Calling that "squandering" is pretty high-handed; are you a Fabian? Or, if
that's not what you meant, what did you mean?</a> 

<p>
<a name="3289qlink3"><a href="3253.html#3259qlink2">&gt;I think a more extropian program would clone terminally ill ultra-talented</a><br>
<i>&gt;and gifted people (that the world can "ill afford" to lose), because a</i><br>
<i>&gt;younger version of a deceased genius could pick up where the old one left</i><br>
<i>&gt;off, and do so much more quickly, given the advantages provided by more</i><br>
<i>&gt;recent technology and intelligence augmentation.</i><br>

<p>
Let's see now, could this be an idea that no one has ever thought of
hereabouts?
<br>
Or could it be sufficiently charged that those who have thought of it don't
talk about it?
<br>
Hmmm, let me think, let me think.</a>

<p>
<a name="3289qlink4"><a href="3253.html#3259qlink3">&gt;Furthermore, cryonics seems entropic in that it denies</a><br>
<i>&gt;that life may create even more talented and gifted people. </i><br>

<p>
How? I fail to see how a personal desire to take a long shot on not
becoming worm food has anything do to with any such "denial".</a> 

<p>
<a name="3289qlink5">Or perhaps you're talking about the people working in the field. Is going
to MIT and dropping out, or going to Julliard and then becoming a taxi
driver, any less such a denial? What do you propose doing about those sorts
of people--they "squander" the attention of the school staffs, don't they?
Hmm, stricter entrance exams?</a>

<p>
<a name="3289qlink6">BTW, for some reason your comments seem reminiscent of Lyndon Larouche's
argument that [paraphrased] "the proper population of Earth is 20(+)
billion, since it will maximize the number of geniuses alive at one time".
Not saying it *is* the same, but it smacks of it to yours truly.</a>

<p>
<a href="3253.html#3259qlink4">&gt;Scientists</a><br>
<a name="3289qlink7"><i>&gt;capable of reviving dead genius could create even greater genius, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;consequently would have no reason to perform resurrections. </i><br>

<p>
As a foregone conclusion, this is of course self-fulfilling. _You_ wouldn't
revive _me_; I'm not even genius grade. (Thanks for the heads up.</a> :)) 

<p>
<a name="3289qlink8">BUT--not even if all it cost were equivalent to the cost of today's Life
Flight helicopter ride and a couple of days in the ICU? say, twelve grand?
That *is* parsimonious of you; have you considered a career in managed care
cost containment?</a> :)

<p>
<a name="3289qlink9"><a href="3253.html#3259qlink5">&gt;After all, it</a><br>
<i>&gt;makes no sense to rebuild a 1950 machine, when you can create a better and</i><br>
<i>&gt;more powerful new one to replace and surpass the old one in 2050. Cryonics</i><br>
<i>&gt;can only hope to revive talented and gifted people, but transhuman extropy</i><br>
<i>&gt;seeks to surpass, exceed, augment, and transcend what has gone before, no</i><br>
<i>&gt;matter how talented and gifted.</i><br>

<p>
And the two are naturally mutually exclusive? Somehow I missed a turn.
Let's not restore the old warbirds (or augment them)--everyone in the
future should be fly-by-wire from the keel up? This is a viewpoint, I
grant. See my next comment.</a>

<p>
<a name="3289qlink10"><a href="3253.html#3259qlink6">&gt;The extropian world can ill afford to believe that it cannot</a> produce greater</a><br>
<a name="3289qlink11"><i>&gt;talents and gifts than it already has. Cryonics contains the seed</a> of its own</i><br>
<a name="3289qlink12"><i>&gt;demise, namely, entropic conceit.</i><br>

<p>
Well, there seems no shortage of conceit hereabouts. :) 
</a>

<p>
<a name="3289qlink13">Permit me to say that I find the twin challenges created  by cryonics, or
_whatever "ambulance to the future" it mutates into as technology
improves_, to be 

<OL>
  <li>  creating a world that wouldn't mind bringing corpsicles back, 
      and probably augmenting them if they're willing, and
</a>
  <li>  creating a world that I (were I a corpsicle) wouldn't mind coming back to.


</OL>
<p>
<a name="3289qlink14">(I.e., "Worth the bother", from both social and individual POV.)</a>

<p>
<a name="3289qlink15">I am completely willing to grant that one or both of these may not come to
be. Nevertheless, 
<br>
nothing you've said so far convinces me that my using those two issues
daily as ethical-political guide stars is in any way entropic or conceited.</a>

<p>
Sorry (sin),
