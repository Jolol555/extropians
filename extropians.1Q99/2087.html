FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                         February 18, 1999

<p>
SPACE PROBE NAME WINNER WILL RECEIVE COMPUTER GIFT CERTIFICATE

<p>
     A $4,000 gift certificate for merchandise from CompUSA will 
go to the grand prize winner of a contest to name the two 
microprobes that comprise NASA's Deep Space 2 mission, which 
successfully launched in early January and are now headed toward 
Mars.

<p>
     Participants in the contest can choose either two people 
from history (not living), characters from mythology or fiction, 
or two places or things that are in some way associated with each 
other, or a combination of any of the above elements.  
Submissions should be accompanied by a short written composition 
of up to 100 words explaining why the entries would make good 
names for the miniature probes. In the case of duplicate names, 
the judges' selection will be based on this composition.  Final 
selection of the probe names will be made by NASA Headquarters.  

<p>
     The deadline is April 30, 1999 and NASA will announce the 
winners in early November this year. The top 25 finalists will 
receive one copy each of a Deep Space 2 poster signed by project 
team leaders. Complete rules, an entry form and further 
information about Deep Space 2 are available at 
<a href="http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds2/">http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds2/</a> or by writing to: Name the Mars 
Microprobe Contest, JPL, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, MS 301-235, 
Pasadena, California 91109.  

<p>
     Prize monies, provided by Lockheed Martin Corp., Boeing Co. 
and CompUSA, will not be administered through NASA, but rather 
will go directly from the donating companies to the winner. 
Although NASA, JPL, International Technology Education 
Association, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and CompUSA employees and 
their families are eligible to enter and win the contest, they 
would not be eligible to collect the grand prize, which would go 
instead to the first runner-up. 

<p>
     Deep Space 2's probes are piggybacking on the Mars Polar 
Lander spacecraft, which launched January 3, and will impact and 
penetrate the surface of Mars this December. Each probe has an 
entry system consisting of a basketball-sized aeroshell with a 
softball-sized probe inside. Released from the cruise stage of 
the Mars Polar Lander, the probes will dive toward the surface of 
Mars. Unlike any spacecraft before, the probes will smash into 
the planet at speeds of up to 200 meters per second (400 miles 
per hour). Upon impact, the forebody of each probe will bury 
itself up to about one meter (three feet) underground, while the 
aftbody remains on the surface to transmit data through the Mars 
Global Surveyor spacecraft back to Earth. 

<p>
     The purpose of the mission, which is managed by NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, is to 
flight-test new technologies to enable future science missions. 
If successful, Deep Space 2 will demonstrate innovative 
approaches to entering a planet's atmosphere, surviving a crashimpact
 and penetrating below a planet's surface. As a secondary 
goal, the probes will search for water ice under Mars' surface. 

<p>
     JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology, 
Pasadena, California.
