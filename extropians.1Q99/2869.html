Yes, people would attempt removal, just as they remove ankle monitors.  And yes, people would attempt circumvention (just as they get friends to blow in their installed auto alcohol breath testers).  Such an implant should be reserved for the most serious crimes, such as serial rape or child molestation, assault which causes permanent maiming or incapacitation, and attempted and actual murder.  And no, I don't think it'll ever be done; I proposed it as a thought experiment.
