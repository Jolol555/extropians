<a name="1740qlink1"><a name="1739qlink1">That *is* the idea.  It just isn't the real life. :(  While I don't think
that the emergency will be widespread enough for the military to 
be plausibly called out, I have no trouble believing that the 
people I was in with (when I was in the US Army) would follow 
these sorts of orders.  The problem is that most soldiers believe 
that their superior officers won't *give* unConstitutional orders,
so if they get an order, it must be Constitutional.  Nor do they
habitually weigh each and every order, or even the unusual
ones, against the Constitution.  Most soldiers do not have even
a good idea of what the Constitution *says*!</a></a>
