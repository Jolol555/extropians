As an a-theist this is a little controversial for me to bring up, but has anyone
ever considered the possibility that there might be certain states of
consciousness - states that have somehow evolved over thousands of years of
natural 'memetic' selection, maybe even biological (psyho-neuro-physiological),
that require a belief in "God" (any religion) in order to pull you through
otherwise impossible emotional tribulation?  I can't tell you the number of
skeptical people I know who fell back on their childhood religious beliefs, even
if only temporarily (hours, days), to pull them through emotionally difficult
periods. As soon as the trouble passes, they resume their lives as happy
agnostics or atheists.

<p>
My own theory is that belief in some kind of a supreme power is *not*
biologically programmed into our genetic code, but that it is a psychological
program imprinted into our brains at an early age.  As much as we enlighten
ourselves through critical thinking, rational inquiry and scientific exploration,
those old programs for many of us re-assert themselves from time to time.  Like
many childhood programs, it may take many years of self-work and re-programming
ones brain in order to eliminate those programs we don't want anymore
