That's true. I think the average P/E ratio for Japanese stocks at the
height was about three times our current level. And, I would argue, their
economy was fundamentally far less sound that that of the U.S.

<p>
The fed is not trying to sustain the economy or the stock market.
Greenspan's goal is very clear -- maintain price stability. Because of the
enormous international role of the US economy, his policy moves now cannot
entirely ignore effects on other countries. He has said several times that
the Fed sets its policies only in relation to the US, yet recently it's
clear that moves towards interest rises have been blunted by the
implications for the world economy. (Of course he can justify that by the
possible feedback effects of less buying of US exports.)

<p>
The latest productivity figures, revised upward for 4Q 98 show that the US
economy is still well above the average productivity gains of the last two
decades. The information economy really is making a difference. I am fairly
confident that we will see another ten years of strong growth in the US.
Europe is a few years behind in the information economy revolution, but
should soon feel the gains, so long as the statist governments there don't
stifle change.

<p>
Onward!
