I agree with the basic point that the Principles shouldn't contain a
position on abortion.

<p>
Simplifying the abortion debate to one of sentience and neurology is not
very useful, IMO, particularly because it misses much of what the debate is
about in the minds of those who deeply care about it.  To most people, the

most questions about morality (and politics) to be about science.</a>  Some
small subset view logic  as an appropriate means of resolving questions

scientific data (some do, some don't).

<p>
<a name="3263qlink1">Thinking that a moral and poltical debate can be resolved by an item of
technical knowledge misses a great deal of the richness of human psychology.
