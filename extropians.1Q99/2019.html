  IAN: A common feature to all aircraft, even rockets, is
  a curved or pointed tip, or nose section, which allows 
  the airframe to slip thought the atmosphere with maximum
  ease. Any shape other than that will not slip through the 
  atmosphere with as much ease. FLT800 did not have a shape 
  like that, in fact, it had the reverse shape, and as such, 
  the references made here to airplanes and gliders and all 
  the advantage they have, and then extrapolating those to
  the post decapitated FLT800 is absolutely contradicted. 

<p>
  One respondent here suggested that we cannot know if a 
  plane with no forward section and open fuselage will not 
  fly like one with intact forward section, unless we do
  the math... no doubt that's the bottom line. However,
  a point I would make is a market-oriented observation:
  If noseless planes fly like or better (since the CIA
  plane flew upto 5 times over the book-climb rate) 
  than planes with noses, why are no aircraft made 
  with their fusalge wide opened?

<a href="1969.html#2019qlink2">&gt;Imagine you are piloting a power boat cruising under power at 20 knots. </a><br>
<i>&gt;Now turn the engine off.  The boat continues to move forward in the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;direction, and begins to slow, due to mainly to the drag of moving thru</i><br>
<i>&gt;the water.  But the boat can still be steered by moving the rudder from</i><br>
<i>&gt;its neutral position.  The boat can even be swung around so it ends up</i><br>
<i>&gt;travelling in the exact opposite of the original direction, even though</i><br>

<i>&gt;way to make the boat shift direction, some of the original momentum and</i><br>
<i>&gt;kinetic energy is expended in making the turn, because the boat has more</i><br>

  IAN: Of course, those motions are not going 
  against or with the force of the Earth's gravity.
