<p>
Can Libertarians and other Freedom Activists

<p>
Effectively Use "Fairness" as a Political Weapon?

<hr>

<p>
by Frederick Mann &lt;&lt;f-prime@activist.com&gt;

<p>
&lt;&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com">http://www.buildfreedom.com</a>&gt;


<p>
The reason that coercive politicians love to use

<p>
"fairness" to justify their policies and programs

<p>
is because "fairness" is a strong "button" for most

<p>
people. "Everyone must pay their fair share." "We

<p>
want fair trade, not free trade." "The Government

<p>
needs to provide fair housing for the poor." Etc.


<p>
Most (if not all) of us have a sense of "fairness."

<p>
When someone treats us unfairly, it tends to raise

<p>
our hackles.


<p>
Microsoft gets attacked because of its allegedly

<p>
"unfair business practices."


<p>
The IRS is hated by many because some of its procedures

<p>
and practices -- not to speak of high tax rates --

<p>
are widely perceived as unfair.


<p>
The recent campaign against the proposal for the "Know

<p>
Your Customer" regulations resulted in over 240,000

<p>
letters and e-mail messages condemning the proposed

<p>
regulations sent to the FDIC, and seems to have at

<p>
least delayed implementation of the regulations. The

<p>
significance is that the right issue can be used to

<p>
reach large numbers of people and persuade them to

<p>
take action.


<p>
Also significant is that the Internet makes it easy,

<p>
convenient, and quick for people to take actions such

<p>
as submitting objections to the appropriate agency,

<p>
writing to their state or federal representatives and

<p>
senators, writing letters to the editor, etc.


<p>
The Libertarian Party set up the Defend Your Privacy!

<p>
website at &lt;&lt;<a href="http://www.defendyourprivacy.com/">http://www.defendyourprivacy.com/</a>&gt;. A

<p>
number of similar websites can be set up, each for

<p>
a specific issue.


<p>
Consider, for example, the "New River, AZ Siege"

<p>
&lt;&lt;<a href="http://www.web-writer.com/newriver/">http://www.web-writer.com/newriver/</a>&gt; and the article

<p>
'Feds to lift 'siege' of Arizona town - Residents win

<p>
standoff against BATF, EPA'

<p>
&lt;&lt;<a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/bluesky_exnews/19990309_xex_feds_to_lift.shtml">http://www.worldnetdaily.com/bluesky_exnews/19990309_xex_feds_to_lift.shtml</a>&gt;.

<p>
The "New River Siege" website could have had an "Action

<p>
Page" that is automated as far as possible for people

<p>
to take action by sending messages to BATF, EPA, the

<p>
appropriate politicians, etc. The Fed's behaviour

<p>
could have been denounced as *unfair*.


<p>
I suspect that "unfair" is much more powerful than

<p>
"unconstitutional."


<p>
Such an "Unfair-Issue" website can be set up by a

<p>
profreedom business, for example, a gun manufacturer.

<p>
In addition to serving as a "campaign vehicle" regarding

<p>
the "unfair issue," the website serves an advertising

<p>
purpose -- "This website is provided by ABC Guns -

<p>
Click here to see our superb guns and rifles." So,

<p>
setting up and maintaining the website can be a

<p>
profitable activity.


<p>
Some libertarian Web Designers could specialize in

<p>
setting up and maintaining "Unfair-Issue" websites

<p>
and offer their services to appropriate businesses

<p>
and organizations.


<p>
It may be worthwhile to quickly set up one or more

<p>
"UNFAIR IRS" websites to take advantage of April 15

<p>
and Tax Freedom Day (May 10th, last year)

<i>&gt;It is time to plan your April 15th event if you are</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;going to have one. Here are some ideas.</i><br>


<p>
<i>&gt;I will be improving on this draft with your suggestions. </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;We will have copies of the Spring 1999 Libertarian</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Alternative available by April.</i><br>


<p>
<i>&gt;I did want to suggest strongly considering using a</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;federal building or IRS office in combination with</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;a USPS. If you can (they need to be fairly close to</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;one another to aviald losing your volunteers enroute)</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;your Protest will be focused on the proper venue and</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;your outreach will be focused on taxpayers. </i><br>


<p>
<i>&gt;I am also leaning to staging LP outreach on Tax Freedom</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Day for a more positive image. </i><br>


<p>
<i>&gt;Candidates can use any event as a kick off for their</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;campaign.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;How to stage a tax filing day protest.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;A. Determine your most effective location.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;1. Factors to consider</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;a. Pedestrian and automobile traffic and patterns</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;b. Visibility of protesters</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;c. Interaction with foot and auto traffic with consideration</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;of any potential to interrupt and create problems</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;d. Appropriateness - will a U.S. Federal or IRS office or</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;building be a better starting point for publicity especially</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;now that many taxpayers are filing electronically!</i><br>


<p>
<i>&gt;It is time to reconsider the time and place of our protests. </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Beginning at a location more suited to protest and continuing</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;on to a local late filers USPS location to reach more people</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;may be a good combination for our efforts. </i><br>


<p>
<i>&gt;Changing to Tax Freedom Day may create a more positive image</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;for our efforts.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;B. Determine your focus </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;1. Ideas</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;a. Banners or flags</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;b. Signs</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;c. LP</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;d. End Tax Abuse</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;e. Reform abusive tax system</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;   etc.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;C. Determine your methodology</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;1. Ideas</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;a. Table with literature</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;b. Rolling rack with literature</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;c. Individuals with literature</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;d. ID all participants with LP Logo (T-shirts, jackets, caps,</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;armbands, temporary attach decals to clothing, etc.)</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;e. Combination of two or more of the above</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;D. Gather all materials well in advance</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;1. From LP</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;a. Legal Memo (Legal precedents affirming the right of LP</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;members to distribute anti-tax materials outside local post</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;offices</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;b. Project Times Two - The million dollar tax day outreach</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;kit (while the NLP million dollar bills are great as they are,</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;they can also be printed slightly smaller 3 up on a page to</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;save costs) Do not forget to add you local address, phone</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;number, etc.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;E. Line up plenty of volunteers</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;F. Publicize, Publicize, Publicize!</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;1. Send multiple Press Releases to every publication within</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;your service area</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;a. Serving notice on the agency (visit them with a nice letter</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;advising them of your plans and a copy of your press release</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;before sending the Press Release - be prepared to reword it if</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;they object to anything you are planning to say about them or</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;their agency - Remember, the individuals at the agency are </i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;axpayers too)</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;b. Serving notice on the public as to the current tax burden</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;they face</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;c. Using individual activists or candidates who will participate</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;as the focus of one or more PR (perhaps a candidate will declare</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;their campaign on that day or the local leader will speak out</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;against taxes in some way)</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;You cannot get too much publicity!</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Send other ideas to me for inclusion in this paper. The NLP</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;booklet is very complete and can be an addendum to this paper.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Duplication will be eliminated once I have that booklet in</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;electronic form. This will be a part of the Regional Manuals</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;when finished (always subject to update and addition of other</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;types of protests)</i><br>


<p>
In addition to physical protests, through "Unfair Issues"

<p>
websites, the means can be provided for largely automated

<p>
electronic protests on a wide scale.


<p>
The Unfair-Issue Strategy may be particularly appropriate for

<p>
any individuals, groups, companies, or organizations that suffer

<p>
unfair government attacks:



<UL>
  <li>  Unfair FCC microradio raids


</UL>
<p>
&lt;&lt;<a href="http://www.onr.com/user/gnn/main.html">http://www.onr.com/user/gnn/main.html</a>&gt;;



<UL>
  <li>  Unfair FDA raids against alternative health practitioners;


  <li>  Unfair targeting of gun manufacturers;


  <li>  Unfair persecution of people in "sex industries" and


</UL>
<p>
their customers;



<UL>
  <li>  Unfair property seizures;


  <li>  Etc, etc.


  <li>  Unfair treatment of libertarian author Peter McWilliams


</UL>
<p>

<p>
Federal Judge Rules Author Peter McWilliams Cannot Use

<p>
Medical Marijuana Even to Save His Life

<p>
&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;/bigger&gt;&lt;/fontfamily&gt;&lt;bigger&gt;&lt;bigger&gt;

<p>
&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/param&gt;Federal Judge George H. King
ruled that author Peter

<p>
McWilliams cannot use medical marijuana while on bail

<p>
awaiting his trial on federal medical marijuana charges. 

<p>
&lt;/fontfamily&gt;

<p>
&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/param&gt;"They're just going to let me
die," said McWilliams, who

<p>
was devastated by the ruling. 

<p>
&lt;/fontfamily&gt;

<p>
&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/param&gt;"[W]e emphasize that we expect
defendant to abide by

<p>
the law and his conditions of release," Judge King noted

<p>
in a ruling issued on March 3, 1999, but not released until

<p>
today [March 9].

<p>
&lt;/fontfamily&gt;

<p>
&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/param&gt;"By this order, we do not mean
to express indifference to

<p>
defendant's situation," Judge King wrote in his ruling. 

<p>
&lt;/fontfamily&gt;

<p>
&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/param&gt;"My doctor and I have tried
everything, and we made this

<p>
very clear in the documents filed with the court. Medical

<p>
marijuana was the only alternative," said McWilliams.  

<p>
&lt;/fontfamily&gt;

<p>
"&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/param&gt;We hope and trust that
defendant and his physician will

<p>
be able to determine a suitable treatment program within

<p>
the law," the ruling stated.

<p>
&lt;/fontfamily&gt;

<p>
&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/param&gt;"The Judge's "hope" and
"trust," while certainly appreciated,

<p>
are not what I need. I needed the judge to act, to give me

<p>
back my medicine so I will be alive to defend myself in

<p>
court," said McWilliams, whose trial on the underlying

<p>
medical marijuana charges are not scheduled to begin

<p>
until September 7, 1999.

<p>
&lt;/fontfamily&gt;

<p>
&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/param&gt;McWilliams' attorney, Thomas J.
Ballanco [310-259-6976],

<p>
said an appeal would be made to the Federal 9th Circuit

<p>
Court.

<p>
&lt;/fontfamily&gt;

<p>
&lt;fontfamily&gt;&lt;param&gt;Times New Roman&lt;/param&gt;The complete ruling and other
related documents are online

<p>
Mary E. Fulginiti, 213-894-6681


<p>
I think the probability is high that a well-promoted Unfair-Issue

<p>
website on the McWilliams case could be used to induce large

<p>
numbers of people to engage in electronic protest.


 

<p>
We could have the makings here of a strategy with awesome

<p>
power to influence masses of people.
