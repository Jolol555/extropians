<p>
181K, 8.5" x 11" at 72 dpi.</a>

<p>
I still have the original, mostly text-based file, so I can change that
if that's not the right size.

<p>
But IT'S NOT FREE.  Or maybe it is.  I haven't decided.
What's the industry standard on residuals?

<p>

<p>
About the Banner:  I would like to ask anyone who uses alternate
versions of the "rainforest" line not to put my name on it; if this line
is merely omitted entirely, *along* with the line about ending
pollution, feel free to impress others with the majesty of my Name.

<p>

<p>
Is anyone interested in the JPEGs for my "Singularity 2005" T-Shirt?
That's what I currently wear at conventions - without the ugly little
copyright notice, BWAH HA HA.

<p>

<p>
Speaking of which, does anyone know someone who can transfer a 72 dpi
JPEG in "thousands of colors" to a T-Shirt so that it comes out AT THAT
RESOLUTION?  My actual T-Shirt looks a lot less impressive, not to say,
or perhaps scream at the top of my lungs, BLURRY.

<p>
For that matter, the brain-and-chip insignia looks a lot more impressive
in the original RGB 16-bit color instead of CMYK, but you can't have everything.

<p>
I consider said image to be my PERSONAL INSIGNIA, so use it NOT without
permission lest the DEMONS OF COPYRIGHT VIOLATION tear out thy nostrils.

<p>
On the other hand, I don't mind people walking around with my personal
insignia on their T-Shirts, practically shouting "I'm a minion of
Eliezer Yudkowsky!"

<p>
This one definitely isn't free, though - that image was NOT easy to put together.
