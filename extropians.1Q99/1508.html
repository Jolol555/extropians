Having worked for a mass mailing company in the past, lemme clear
something up.  All of the refuse lists are voluntary.  The only criteria 
that the USPS cares about are whether the addresses are in a standard
format (to lower costs), and whether the addresses are deliverable.
If someone chose to ignore the refuse lists, they might eventually</a> get
sued, but in the short run, the major factor is the non-trivial costs of
mailing the junk.  Why bother spending money on someone who has
essentially notified you that they will toss anything received?
