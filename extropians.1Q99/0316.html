He did get the Nobel Prize, did he not? That prize comes with it a cash award of
about $1,000,000.00 in today's money, which should have been around $100,000.00
back then. Not a bad return for some doodling in a patent office in one's off
hours....

<p>
Not to mention the nicely paid position at Princeton with plenty of grant money
flowing in. The grant scam is a great business to be in, where its easy to
scream poverty while caching away huge chunks, reselling old lab or field
equipment to a new grant project, that has been used in other research several
times and paid for each time).

How many plain old socialists get a chance to bend the President of the U.S.'s
ear on occasion?

with incomplete facts, and purposely excluding commonly obvious facts that
conflict with one's prejudices, while rationalizing that denial. Both are errors
of logic.</a>
