<i>&gt; Don't you realize that this is the same view held by the religious nuts?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2275qlink1">Yes, and I bet that (some) religious nuts drink thea, wear T-shirts
and ride a bike, but that doesn't mean that those things
are automatically bad. The same goes for some of their ideas/
</a>methods. 

<p>
<a href="2255.html#2268qlink2">&gt; Everybody seems to want to outlaw other views and limit teaching to</a><br>
<i>&gt; their view.  </i><br>

<p>
It's not as much the views that matter but their (inevitable) results.
The brainwashed offspring of those nuts will shape the society
of the future, not in the last place because they produce more
offspring than atheists. See Israel for example, those guys really
have a problem. And the US, the most powerful nation on earth,
is still in the grip of primitive superstition at the brink of the 21st
century. Amazing! If  you want to fight superstition and ignorance, 
you must nip it in the bud. This bud happens to be the brainwashing
done by parents. Later other institutions take over, but the position
of the parents and direct relatives remains very important.

<p>
<a href="2255.html#2268qlink3">&gt; Everybody thinks that their viewpoint can be justified, and</a><br>
<i>&gt; that such a position would improve everyone's situation.</i><br>

<p>
Sure, but only few are right. Transhumanists are some of those
few. 

<p>
<a href="2255.html#2268qlink4">&gt; Such a position is dangerous, whether you hold the "right" view or the</a><br>
<i>&gt; "wrong" view.  I am constantly amazed at how much people are willing to</i><br>
<i>&gt; override the desires of other because "we know we're right".</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2288qlink1"><a name="2275qlink2">We can scientifically prove that we're right, something that the others
can't. Also, we can scientifically prove that the other memes will usually
deminish one's quality of life, and *always* lead to the permanent
destruction of the host. Our intentions are good, and our methods
are sound. It doesn't get any better than</a> that.
</a>
 
<p>
<a href="2255.html#2268qlink5">&gt; Why is your position any better than the conservative desire to outlaw</a><br>
<i>&gt; the teaching of evolution and limit teaching to just the Bible?  Is it</i><br>
<i>&gt; because you're belief system is true and theirs is false?  </i><br>

<p>
<a name="2288qlink2">Transhumanism, in its pure rationalist form, is simply the most
practical, user-friendly meme around. The only one which really
has the potential to provide eternal life, freedom and happiness.
Through technology and reason we shall overcome, so to speak.</a>
The rest are either outright lies (religion) or defeatist nonsense 
(humanism) which offer only false protection from reality. Opium 
for the people.

<p>
<a href="2255.html#2268qlink6">&gt; Do we really</a><br>
<i>&gt; want to outlaw the teaching of wrong theories?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2288qlink3">What we want is the elimination of bad memes. As the religion/
communist/fascist etc. memes are apparently more efficient
at taking people over than rationalism, individualism and
transhumanism, it would probably be necessary to support
those memes by actively suppressing the bad ones. After
a while (a couple of generations) the new memes would probably 
have become ingrained enough in the mainstream to make it on 
their own. Perhaps. After all, it is no coincidence that memes like 
religion have dominated human history.</a>

<p>
<a name="2288qlink4"><a href="2255.html#2268qlink7">&gt; Won't this lead to the</a><br>
<i>&gt; State being run by Thought Police?</i><br>

<p>
It is *already* run by thought police (only their methods are still
relatively crude), so what's there to lose?
