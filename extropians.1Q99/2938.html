This line is from a Country song which I don't remember the singer or title of
at the moment, but it nicely sums up the idea that you have to make some
initial assumptions if you're to be able to function at all.  Maybe reality is
all illusion, but this illusion is pretty illusionary happy, and unproven
logic seems to provide some illusory desired effects.  Even the assumption
that there can be no assumptions is an assumption...anyone have a good koan?
