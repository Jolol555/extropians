Actually last time I saw any figures, Scotland's murder rate was listed as
3.x per 100,000, where x was somewhere between 1 and 5; that's more than most 
of mainland Europe and rural America. Otherwise I generally agree with the
points about the troublemakers.

<p>
Also, I just saw an article pointing out that the per-capita assault rate 
in the small town near to where I'm currently working in England is three 
times higher than New York, burglary four or fives times higher, and car 
theft six times higher (the latter no surprise since there are far more 
cars per person here than NYC). I expect much of that is a statistical 
oddity because one is a town of thousands and the other a city of millions, 
but England isn't a particularly safe place either; almost makes me wish I 
had moved to NYC after all.
