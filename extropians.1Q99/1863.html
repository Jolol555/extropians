Yes, my bank, Citizen's Bank, is starting to tighten up its policies. They used
to cash any check brought in by a long time account holder, no matter what you
account balance is. Now they are getting strict about there being at least as
much money in your account as the check is for before they will cash it.
Otherwise, you have to deposit it and they are taking the full 24 hours to
activate the funds in your account, and they want to violate the covenant they
had with First NH Bank when the bought it and stretch it out to two days like
they have with the rest of their customers. Not only that, but when you deposit
an amount larger than your current balance, they freeze your entire account till
the check clears, which can cause your own checks and account linked credit card
charges to bounce.

<a href="1861.html#1863qlink2">&gt; This leaves us with a choice:</a><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As I said, this is a prisoners' dilemna situation, and the rational solution</i><br>

I'm just going to deposit every other paycheck now, and cash the others. My own
living expenses are actually less than half my income now anyways, so I can make
my monthly payments on the deposited sums. If the bank goes under, I most likely
won't have more than a week or two's pay in the bank....

The biggest cause of economic turmoil at y2k will be caused by people panicking.
Fear is the most palpable economic force.
