That is a very important point, and I hope your right.  Because the central
point of my entire scenario is a us wide power outage.  If one does not occur,
then my scenario becomes much less likely.  I think the truth on this point
needs to be found.  Does anyone know a very knowledgeable person in the power
industry?

<p>
<a name="1738qlink1">Without further information, I still doubt your assessment.  It is my
understanding that they use embedded chips for maintenance and shut down
cycles.  In otherwords, if a particular power station has not received a checkup
after a certain period of time it *shuts down*.  So if it read 1/1/1900, the
station will think it hasn't had a checkup in 100 years, and it will shut down.
If this is true, then if a critical minimum of them shut down they should take
the rest of the grid down</a> with it.

<p>
Please correct me if I am wrong about this.  :-)

<p>
<a name="1738qlink2">If a US wide power outage does occur, transportation *will* stop, and people
will starve.  So I think are only point of disagreement is over weather a
nationwide power outage is likely.</a>

<a href="1704.html#1716qlink3">&gt; You can only do that in foreign countries - attempting it in America would</a><br>
<i>&gt; be political suicide for the President.  Besides, they can't possibly</i><br>
<i>&gt; conduct such a search in any reasonable amount of time, and I doubt that the</i><br>

<i>&gt; personnel I know say they would refuse).  It violates too many</i><br>
<i>&gt; Constitutional provisions for even today's politicians to stomach.</i><br>

<p>
A military coup is a military coup, and Clinton and the rest of the politicians
become totally irrelevant.  Its quite possible, they may be the first to bite
the bullet from Martial Law.

<p>
<a href="1704.html#1716qlink4">&gt; Even if everything you outlined happened, 'They' still don't have control -</a><br>

<i>&gt; can't seize power because the armed forces won't follow such orders.  Who</i><br>
<i>&gt; does that leave?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1738qlink3">According to the military people I know, their saying its the military their
most afraid of.  The military is a totalitarian government all to itself already
</a>and therfore not a big  stretch to enforce their way on everyone else. The
military is not a democracy , it's chain-of-command, and its leaders could give
a rats ass whether its members want to or not.  Most infantry do what their told
or face the threat of court martial or even death if they don't.

<p>
Although these are the points we differ,  I hope I'm wrong and your right about
this.  I look forward to your next response.
