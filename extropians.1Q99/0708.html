<a name="0900qlink4">Part of the problem is the nature of the topics we discuss.  Honestly, how
many of us are qualified to write a rigorous analysis of a topic that spans
half a dozen disciplines?</a>  A detailed justification of any particular
Singularity scenario, for example, requires an understanding of every field
of technology you want to take into account, plus a bit of political
science, history and economics.  It is very easy to be overwhelmed by the
impossibility of covering the entire topic, and end up writing nothing at
all.

The traditional solution, of course, is to pick a sub-topic you can do
justice to.  Unfortunately that doesn't work well when dealing with future
scenarios, because the different components are often mutually
interdependent.  What we really is a better mechanism for doing on-line
collaboration - perhaps a web site set up for use as a moderated
discussion/collaboration forum.
