<p>
This is a case where the initial theory - that geese are strictly
monogamous - turned out to be wrong. So the existence of "infidelity" is
largely illusory.

<i>&gt;noises (which are rather loud).</i><br>

<p>
Chimps have long been known to be promiscuous. The main constraint is the
fact that dominant males try to reserve the females to themselves, causing
the subordinate males to be sneaky about mating opportunities. Again this
is not an instance of "infidelity". Fornication is not (necessarily)
adultery.
