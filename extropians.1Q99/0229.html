<a name="0260qlink1">Pardon me?  "Lack of personal integrity?"  That's a rather strong
phrase, don't you think?  Let's not Atlas overboard.  The strong exist
to serve the weak - but I consider myself one of the strong, and would
never dream of enunciating that theory for my own benefit,</a> or for that
matter of using force to compel any person A to serve person B.</a>  Does my
<a name="0260qlink2">defiance of Ayn Rand's morality make me a looter?</a>  And for that matter,
<a name="0260qlink3">there is a long way between saying "I have a right to your new stereo"
and stealing it.  One can believe in that right, while still believing
that your property rights take precedence.</a>

<a name="0305qlink2"><a name="0255qlink1">I don't think that socialism/Libertarianism has anything to do with lack
of personal integrity.  It is possible to be a socialist and still have
plenty of personal integrity; it's just stupid, because socialism has
been demonstrated not to work.  Personal integrity is defined by your
unswerving adherence to high ideals for deeply altruistic reasons, not
the intelligence or stupidity manifest in choosing those ideals.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="0305qlink3">If Libertarian countries were squalid, criminal, poverty-stricken,
fear-ruled countries, and socialist countries were wealthy,
technological, educated bastions of opportunity, I would be a socialist.
 Does this reflect my lack of personal integrity?</a>
