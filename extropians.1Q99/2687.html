I've lately thought that on Mon, 01 Mar 1999, Timothy Bates wrote:

<p>
For most, actually. :)

<p>
<a href="2654.html#2687qlink2">&gt;I think lieing is always fraud (bad information sold as good).</a><br>

<p>
I agree in every case where it *was* sold.  That is, it is the
selling that makes it fraud, rather than simple deceit.

<p>
<a href="2654.html#2687qlink3">&gt;I am confused about the fire in a theatre example. I agree with you that it</a><br>
<i>&gt;implies you have a contract with people that you may not have and i worry</i><br>
&lt;snip&gt;

<p>
I would say that if it is clear that Joe Excited was not allowed into the
theater unless he agreed not to falsely cry "fire", yelling "fire" is a 
violation of contract.  

<p>
<a href="2654.html#2687qlink4">&gt;The difference is that in the latter case you are giving information, in the</a><br>
<i>&gt;former you are lying and saying what a reasonable man knows will in all</i><br>
<i>&gt;probability cause serious injury and at the very least ruin a night out for</i><br>
<i>&gt;150 people etc. etc.</i><br>

<p>
I think that the main difference here is that I see the cause of
(say) Sam's broken leg is the idiot who stepped on him, whereas
it seems that you are saying that said idiot was not a cause,
that he is not responsible for his own actions, and that Joe Excited
(who yelled "fire!") *is*, even though he was across the room and
had no control over the idiot's behavior.

<p>
I agree that it is dispicable to yell "fire!" in a crowded theater, and
not nice besides, but I don't think that it should be illegal by *default*,
but only by contract.

<p>
<i>&gt;So, I say</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2654.html#2687qlink5">&gt;truth = always protected.</a><br>
<i>&gt;opinion = always protected.</i><br>

<p>
Okay.

<p>
<a href="2654.html#2687qlink6">&gt;lying = unprotected speech.</a><br>

<p>
I would say, only when exchanged for value in expectation
of truth.

<p>
<a href="2654.html#2687qlink7">&gt;soliciting for a crime = unprotected.</a><br>

<p>
I would say, only if solicitor contracts to be liable
for her agent's actions...
