How strange. I read Usenet almost every day, so I can't quite understand
how the spammers have killed it; in fact I rarely see any spam ad in there
these days. One reason for that is that rather than arguing for pointless
laws, people went out and started cancelling the spams. Technical solutions
to technical problems.</a>

<p>
Indeed. That's why us good men are so concerned about you evil anti-spam
freaks who don't seem to have a clue as to the effects of your proposed
laws on non-spammers. You want to sacrifice our freedom and privacy for
your supposed safety. We don't want</a> that.

<p>
<a name="1560qlink3">You cannot stop spam with laws unless those laws are globally enforced
and all traces of Internet privacy is eliminated. That means no
anonymity, no encryption, and ID checks before anyone is allowed on the
Net. That is evil, and you and Mike and the other anti-spam freaks are
the worst threat to freedom on the Net today.</a>

<a name="1560qlink4">I can only assume that aliens have kidnapped Mike and replaced him with
a government-loving fascist clone, because he's usually far more sensible
than he has been recently.
