<i>&gt; A fun article exploring the consequences of having continous time. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; turns out that this enables Turing machines to compute uncomputable</i><br>
<i>&gt; numbers. The proof is rather simple: imagine two Turing machines, one</i><br>
<i>&gt; with clock frequency 1 and the other with frequency tau, which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrational. If the first is programmed to output n ones and then halt</i><br>
<i>&gt; when given the input n, and the other is programmed to output n zeros</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then halt. A third machine simply concatenates the outputs as they</i><br>
<i>&gt; arrive, creating a composite stream of interleaved ones and zeros. It</i><br>
<i>&gt; turns out that this little machine can compute uncomputable numbers</i><br>
<i>&gt; simply by selecting the right tau. Neat. The rest of the paper is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; bit more speculative, and I don't buy the author's idea that brains</i><br>
<i>&gt; become powerful by being parallel and exploiting continous times (then</i><br>
<i>&gt; our thinking would be highly sensitive to delays, which occur</i><br>
<i>&gt; naturally in aging). But it is definitely a fun way of extending the</i><br>
<i>&gt; TM.</i><br>

<p>
The difficulty with this is the effects of noise -- any finite amount of
noise will destroy the ability to compute "uncomputable" functions.

<p>
Another example is a hypothetical coin whose probability of coming up
heads is Chaitin's omega, the number whose binary expansion simply
enumerates the values of the hlating function.  By repeatedly tossing such
a coin we could determine the halting function.  Nothing in the laws of
nature precludes such a coin from existing.  (It is easy to define quantum
analogues of this, if you are worried about quantum effects).  However,
<a name="3392qlink1">once again noise will prevent you from actually following the above
procedure, even should such a coin magically come into your hands.</a>

<p>
(On a related note, there are several interesting papers showing that
analogue computational machines with exponential precision can solve
NP-complete problems in polynomial time.<a name="3392qlink2">  Once again, noise destroys any
hope of using such machines in any practical sense.)</a>
