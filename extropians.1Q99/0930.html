Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine
  irradiation parameters of a 780 nm low
  power CW diode laser (6.5 mW) leading to
  enhanced proliferation of cultured normal human keratinocytes (NHK). The
  possible role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this response was
  evaluated. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: NHK were exposed to a single
  dose of 0 to 3.6 J/cm2 (0-180 sec) of irradiation. Proliferation parameters
  studied were: incorporation of 3H-thymidine during 6-24 hr
  following irradiation; percentage of dividing cells and
  number of cells, 24 hr and 48 hr following irradiation,
  respectively. RESULTS: Proliferation of NHK exposed to 0.45-0.95 J/cm2 was
  significantly enhanced by 1.3-1.9-folds relative to sham-irradiated controls,
  as inferred from parameters studied. Exposure to other energy densities was
  considerably less effective in enhancing proliferation parameters. Added
  enzymatic antioxidants, superoxide dismutase or catalase, scavenging
  superoxide anions and H2O2, suppressed this enhanced proliferation. Added
  scavengers (alpha-tocopherol acetate, scavenging lipid peroxidation, or
  sodium azide, histidine, mannitol, scavenging singlet oxygen, superoxide
  anions, and hydroxyl radicals, respectively), or N-acetyl cysteine, the
  thiol-reducing agent, suppressed the response, but to different extents.
  CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that 780 nm
  low power diode laser
<br>
  irradiation enhanced keratinocytes proliferation in vitro, with an apparent
  involvement of ROS in this response, and comparably, might be used to promote
  their proliferation in vivo to enhance wound healing.
