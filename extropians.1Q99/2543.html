&gt; Spike, don't you live near Palo Alto?  If you do, I think there is still a Spa
&gt; operating there called Watercourse Way.  ...About 10 years ago, they had 3 tanks.

<p>
 I do.  Cool!  Thanks Paul, Ill check that out and report back.  Now that I think it
over, I might be able to reproduce something like this in my own home, for
I have a bathroom  that is not adjacent to any external wall, with a very large
tub, and my house is quite well sound insulated.  I could light seal the door
and produce total darkness and quiet.  I think I even have a box of epsom
salts around here somewhere.  That sounds kinda cool: a sensory deprivation
sort of thing.  spike
