In attempting to create a theology appealing to extropians or to define what
such a thing would be like, you'd have to include some reason that it is
better than no theology at all. Since extropians seek to increase
efficiency, you'd have to avoid advocating something that is a waste of time
and other resources. It would have to involve some sort of useful shortcut
to thinking. You must avoid creating a meme that masks possibilities and
ways of arriving at those possibilities. Most religions that I have come
across do not come close to meeting these criteria. They also fall prey to
the aesthetic problems that you state above.

<p>
Would you say that a theology requires some strong positive belief? If so, I
suspect that no theology you create could be consistent with extropianism. 

<p>
Why is a cosmology and value system centered around a god better than one
which isn't?

Great questions, Jason.  Does Force equal mass times acceleration?  Does
Energy equal mass times the square of the velocity of light?  Does God need
any more justification than that, if he does, in fact, exist?

This last point is the question isn't it?  Does God exist? Not does he make
things better.

I asserted in another message that God is the enevitable product of a
technological civilization if it lasts long enough.  Tell me why that's wrong?
