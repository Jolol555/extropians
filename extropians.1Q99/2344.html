I'm not sure Michael and I are not saying the same thing in different 
words. Anyway, there is one thing in Billy's comment that I 
want to pick<a name="2354qlink1"> on. What Billy calls "mind control system" could 
in my opinion better be called "motivation system". Every agent needs 
a motivation system, and just because its motivation system was 
deliberately designed by another being rather than happened 
accidentally (due to genetical and environmental factors) doesn't 
make it any less part of what that agent</a> is. It's not an external 
coersion, it is part of its nature --"Don't change me, don't cancel 
my love for human beings. This is who I am and this is what I want to 
be. I know I would not have had these desires and values if my 
constructors hadn't made my goal-module that way; so what. You humans 
would not have had the values you have if evolution hadn't made your 
goal-modules the way they are. Free will does not require that one 
somehow creates one's values out of empty air; to do so would be 
totally random. No, you start with what is given to you -- your 
values, your preferences -- and those are the criteria by which you 
judge whether a proposed change would be an improvement.
