No, he didn't.  When you read the article carefully, you see:

See the weasel word here?  "Likely" given?  Sanchez is *speculating*
about the kind of scenario involved.  He apparently does not have direct
knowledge of the soldiers' orders, but given the overall scenario he
has concluded that it is some kind of extraction simulation, and he is
fleshing it out with some made-up details.

<p>
Military simulations in urban environments have been going on for some
time, and there are legitimate concerns about safety and notice to
local officials.  However there is no need to assume that these are
rehearsals for a government takeover.  Many overseas operations will
have to be carried out within cities.  It may well be that these are
intended to train troops for a variety of legitimate military operations.
