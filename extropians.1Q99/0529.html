<a name="0539qlink2">I don't.  I don't know it doesn't exist, either.  But if I want to make
intelligent choices, I have to assume that there are differences between
choices.  If I wish to consider the consequences of my actions, I have
to assume that some consequences are preferable to others.  I don't make
an assumption about particular values, which is an old trick of
missionaries; I make only the assumption that some unknown distinction
exists.  That is the minimal assumption needed to yield differential
values in a logical goal system, and no further assumption can</a> be justified.

<p>
<a name="0539qlink3">The alternative is believing in my own prejudices, which is outright
silly.  I know where my innate preferences come from, to wit: evolution,
and I trust evolution's design for my mind no more than I trust its
design for my body.  There is no distinction between doing what
evolution wants and believing everything you read.</a>

<p>
If it does exist, I wouldn't know;
<br>
therefore my lack of knowledge does not prove nonexistence.

<a name="0539qlink4">I don't necessarily _believe_ in objective morality, but my best course
is to _act_ as if objective morality.</a>

<p>
I don't _believe_ in logic, but I have no alternative but to _reason_
using the best logic I have.

<p>
I can't prove this world isn't a figment of my imagination, but it would
be even less useful to reason about any other set of facts.

<p>
I don't trust my mind, but I can't think with anything else.

<p>
The validity of reason, the validity of choice, or the validity of
knowledge cannot be proven; but there is no better way available.
