<a name="1996qlink1"><a name="1990qlink1">&gt;&gt; If something can move FTL, then relativity is obviously not correct

&gt;&gt; the first place. The reason FTL is dismissed in relativity (besides
&gt;&gt; the impossibility of accelerating beyond c)

<p>
FTL does not depend on _accelerating_ beyond c.  A constant acceleration
of less than c would result in travel at faster than the speed of light
relative to your start point.

&gt;&gt; is that it would
<br>
&gt;&gt; completely mess up causality, which generally is/was regarded as a
bad
<br>
&gt;&gt; thing. If you buy Novikov's principle of self-consistency or
something
<br>
&gt;&gt; similar, then this might not be a serious problem after all -
&gt;&gt; causality gets weird and loopy, but not inconsistent. 

<pre>
<a name="1996qlink2"><a name="1990qlink2">&gt;&gt; However, "time travel" in various forms can be done without FTL. One
&gt;&gt; example would be wormholes, which are allowable solutions to general
&gt;&gt; relativity (even if their physical possibility remains unknown). With
&gt;&gt; wormholes you can move to a distant time and/or space without going
&gt;&gt; FTL in your local frame. The same problems with causality might
&gt;&gt; emerge, but again quantum effects such as the Visser build up of
&gt;&gt; virtual particle or Novikov's principle might keep physics sane.

</pre>
<p>
Problems with causality/wormholes are due to the 'space/time continuum'
- an artifact of relativity theory.
