<i>&gt;      As someone with an interest in both &gt;H and Theology, I couldn't resist</i><br>
<i>&gt; joining in on this discussion.  I think one of the first things I would ask</i><br>
<i>&gt;of</i><br>
<i>&gt; you is what you are using as initial parameters.  Theology, if I remember</i><br>
<i>&gt; correctly, means "The study of God (or gods)."  This implies that you are</i><br>
<i>&gt; predicting the existence and or emergence of a God or gods.  So my first</i><br>
<i>&gt; question is what criteria would a being have to meet to be classified as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; god?  There have been several such standards suggested.  Two that seem to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; fairly constant is Power and Worship.  A god is thus defined as in some way</i><br>
<i>&gt; being incredibly (transcendantly?) capable, and/or being worshipped.  Given</i><br>
<i>&gt; the strong libertarian and humanist background of Extropianism, worship</i><br>
might
<br>
<a href="2248.html#2257qlink2">&gt; be something that Extropians might find unappealing (for to worship</a><br>
implies a
<br>
<a href="2248.html#2257qlink3">&gt; level of submission, and to be worshipped implies having others dependent</a><br>
<i>&gt;upon</i><br>
<i>&gt; you).  However, there is another way to look at the worship issue.  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; think first what qualities are worthy of worship, by which I mean what</i><br>
<i>&gt; principles (memes?) are you willing to give you life to and for (for some</i><br>
<i>&gt; people, the answer would be none), now posit the possibility of a being or</i><br>
<i>&gt; beings capable of exemplifying those principles perfectly, as well as having</i><br>
<i>&gt; the power to back up those principles, then you might just have found that</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is a God(s) to you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;      Adrian, I believe you said you were interested in developing an</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt; Theology.  This I imagine would have two main qualities, one would be a God</i><br>
<i>&gt;or</i><br>
<i>&gt; gods whom uphold Extropian values, and a Cosmology based on an Extropian</i><br>
<i>&gt; worldview.  In such a theology, I imagine a deity would begin in some</i><br>
<i>&gt;material</i><br>
<i>&gt; substrate and develop through an evolutionary process.  In fact, intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; life in this Universe might be considered the raw materials from which gods</i><br>
<i>&gt; will develop somewhere on the other side of the Singularity.  I agree with</i><br>
<i>&gt;you</i><br>
<i>&gt; that such a deity would likely not be very interested in worship.  You may</i><br>
<i>&gt; have some different starting points for the concept of a god, if so I would</i><br>
<i>&gt;be</i><br>
<i>&gt; very interested in discussing them.  I also have some other ideas to discuss</i><br>
<i>&gt; as per the Monotheism vs Pantheism debate, but it will have to wait for</i><br>
<i>&gt; another post.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Glen Finney &gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Great thinking, Glen!  How about "all powerful, all knowing and Good" as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;definition of God.  I am certain God doesn't need worship in the traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt;sense.  However, I consider the study of science to be the study of the mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;of God, and that this study is worship.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I include theology, ethics, morality, education, business, political science</i><br>
<i>&gt;and social science as sciences as long as they are done scientifically.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Monotheism, Pantheism is moot.  God is both.  God is made up of distinct</i><br>
<i>&gt;individuals (us or our successors) and an emergent corporate entity.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have already developed my theology and am testing it in the Extropian group</i><br>
<i>&gt;since I have always been a Libertarian and find that I definitely believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Extropian principles.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2269qlink1">Perhaps you could tell us about your theology.  That way, we could</a> see
where you're coming from.  Personally, I don't believe in a single God, and
I don't see how 'God' could be both monotheistic and pantheistic.  But if
you explained how you arrived at that conclusion, perhaps we'll all
understand better.

<p>
<a href="2251.html#2257qlink4">&gt;My cosmology is simply whatever is the standard model of the scientific</a><br>
<i>&gt;community and will change as that model changes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Glen, thank you for your terrific contribution.  I am thrilled that Anders is</i><br>
<i>&gt;interested (I consider him one of the most innovative thinkers and educators</i><br>
<i>&gt;of our time) and you are certainly a worthy adition.</i><br>
