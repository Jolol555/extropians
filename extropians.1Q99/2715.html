<p>
Perhaps our mistake has been in assuming we require some type of
forceful deletion of "bad" posts, or even some automated
though-not-global filtering method.  It may be that simple audience
feedback would suffice to show which topics and posts are being
well-received; I think everyone here is benevolent enough to voluntarily
respond to that.  In fact, I would love any kind of audience feedback on
general principles; right now I have no real idea whether, say, the
initial-vs.-Interim was perceived as a cosmically important issue or a
huge waste of time, whether it had avid readers or was being trashed by
virtually everybody.

<p>
Design requirements: (1a indicates non-priority requirement)


<OL>
  <li>  Provide a means for any person to register a rating on any message,
including those persons not having HTML email readers.  Do NOT rate authors.
1a. Prevent multiple ratings.  Honor system may work okay.

  <li>  The ratings should be complex enough to express at least the
following messages:  "Great post", "worth reading", "waste of time".
2a. Desirable additional ratings:  "Not worth reading", "changed my
mind".  Optional one-line comments.

  <li>  Distinguish between anonymous, attributed (visible to poster only),
and public (visible to everyone) ratings.
3a. Make public ratings visible on the CritMail archive.
3b. Use a password system to access detailed attributed worthit on CritMail.

  <li>  Communicate the {sum of anonymous}, {sum of worthit} and the {list
of attributed and public cheers and boos} in a digest mailed to each
poster each day.


</OL>
<p>
Design:


<OL>
  <li>  Non-HTML clients:  If you reply to a message and the message body
begins with '$', the message is interpreted as a one-line rating
command, and the rest of the message is discarded.  Samples:


</OL>
<p>
<i>$public cheer		// Everyone can find out I think this is great.</i><br>
<i>$attrib worthit		// Increments worthit; poster can find it's from me</i><br>
$anon waste =Who cares?	// Sends an anonymous boo and comment<br>
$get			// returns public ratings on the message; if your<br>
return address equals the poster's, you get a detailed breakdown of
attributed "worthits".

<p>
1a.  Read this even if the responder sends HTML.

<p>
2.  HTML clients:  Attach a FORM containing an input line for a comment
and radio buttons set by default to 'attrib' and 'worthit'.
2a. Do this only for list members that register as having an HTML client.
