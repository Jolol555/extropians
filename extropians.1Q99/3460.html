<p>
well defined command structure:
<br>
<a name="3463qlink1">as an insurgency, the last thing that would keep them viable were if their
command structure were publicly known.</a> Just because it might not be publicly
<a name="3463qlink2">known, or even completley known to the entire organization, does not mean
there is not one. The cell structure is a well recognized system of
structuring an insurgency organization.</a>

<p>
<a name="3463qlink3">control of territory:
<br>
this is not well defined. You could say that simply being able to elude
capture, thus denying the government's ability to police an area effectively,
is at least a measure of control. By your criteria, Thomas Paine was a common
criminal.</a>
<br>
<a name="3463qlink4">Considering how much the government likes to govern by poll results, you could
call areas where the government has a minority of local support</a> as being under
<a name="3463qlink5">the tentative 'control' of the insurgency.</a>

<p>
<a name="3463qlink6">Must wear uniforms:
<br>
I know of no insurgency organization which has ever had more than a small
fraction which actually wore what could be considered uniforms. Nor would any
of them wear such unifoms in public where they could easily be identified by
government agents.</a>

<p>
<a name="3463qlink7">If this were a real criteria, then movements like the PLO, NRA, ANC,
Sandinistas, Contras, Zapatistas, Mujahedin, Viet Cong, Chinese democracy
movements, as well as the American Revolutionaries would all be nothing but
common criminals.</a>

<p>
<a name="3463qlink8">Every movement starts out with nothing. Your criteria are merely the measure
of what an insurgency needs to accomplish to have hope of being successful.</a>

<p>
<a name="3463qlink9">What I find so remarkable, and indicative that the government had a hand in
<a name="3466qlink2">it, was a) how handily McVeighs actions neatly castrated the burgeoning
militia</a> movement, and
<pre>
b) how easily he was caught, the license plate on his care dissapeared.
c) the evidence about John Doe #2
d) the evidence that there were booster charges placed on the basement
</pre>
structural columns that were of typical BATF training manual construction.</a>

<p>
<a name="3463qlink10">By the way, I also think McVeigh should hang.</a>
