 Is it okay to enslave something so long as it is

<a href="2710.html#2797qlink1">&gt;doesn't</a><br>

<p>
There is no obvious answer.  Our culture frowns on gratuitous cruelty to
animals, but accepts slavery of animals.  Even cruelty is accepted if it
is for a worthwhile purpose such as medical research, safety research, or
product development and testing.



<p>
Or maybe it is wrong to have

<a href="2710.html#2797qlink2">&gt;domesticated</a><br>
<i>&gt;animals, making them serve our whims and needs, linking them to us </i><br>

<i>&gt;breeding them into a perpetual childlike state, and "putting down" </i><br>
<i>&gt;any &gt;domestic that goes "feral".</i><br>


<p>
Various domestic animals are intentionally or unintentionally selectively
bred for characteristics we value, but it is difficult to 'blame' any
particular individual for that, since the process takes so long, and most
pet owners do not even do that intentionally.  It is understandable that
the average person would prefer a domestic cat as a pet over a bobcat or
a rat.


<p>
Ferrets have become somewhat popular as pets even though there is no
lengthy history of them being kept and bred.  Cats, in contrast, have
been kept for 5,000 years, and dogs for longer.
