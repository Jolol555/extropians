I believe that rape, murder &amp; genocide are wrong, but I cannot point to
some Book &amp; demand that sinners repent. At best I can point to economic
analyses that show these things to be inefficient, but what are the odds
that a rapist/murderer/genocide will be moved by such? I can only work
to make a world where they are wrong because *we make it so*, just as we
work to make our Transhuman/Extropian

goals real.

Okay, the basic fallacy here is that anybody knows what the Objective
Morality is. I ain't got a clue.

<a name="0529qlink1">If no one knows the Objective Morality, howdo you even know it exists?</a>
This harks back to discussions on the nature of deity &amp; its
<br>
'unknowability', wherein the existence of this unknown/unknowable thing<br>
was taken for granted.  I make no such allowance for the existence of
"The Objective Morality", if it is 
<br>
unknown &amp;/or unknowable.

just as objective (&amp; hence independently verifiable?) as your choice of
behaviors;  please post the equations for this moral mathematics.

Glad to meet another Discworld fan!
