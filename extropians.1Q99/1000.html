You need to go back and run the numbers.  The only energy source in the
solar system that puts out enough power to move that much mass is the sun -
and you'd need to capture a significant fraction of its output to do it.
That means mega-scale engineering, which is probably impossible without SI
anyway.</a>

<p>
Now, no known technology will allow us to stop such a weapon without landing
on it, building our own motive system, and spending years accelerating it to
change its vector.  However, no known technology will let you assemble it in
secret either.  Moving that much mass will produce fireworks easily visible
for light-years, and it will take years to get anything done.  Everyone you
could threaten will know what you are up to long before the weapon is ready
for use.

<p>
Also, by the time you could do something like that many, many other things
will have changed.  Is it really the ultimate, megascale uses of nanotech
that worry you, or do you see more immediate worries?
