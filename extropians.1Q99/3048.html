Another idea I had was to have coils in the soles of one's shoes that will draw
power from grids embedded in hallways and walkways, etc. Or using the same power
unit found in the soles of those damn LED lit sneakers.....must be a peizo
generator.

<i>&gt; &gt; report their location within that time frame.</i><br>

<i>&gt; I'm picturing a system that sends a brief message at varying intervals</i><br>

<i>&gt; want the wearer to know when the next transmission is due, there will be</i><br>

<i>&gt; for instance).  Ideally we would like this situation to be handled by some</i><br>
<i>&gt; automated system, in order to minimize costs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The hardwired-station idea would work, but we'd have to build an awful lot</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them (probably several hundred thousand just to cover major urban areas</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the U.S.), and even then you have to give the wearer enough time to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; to one (maybe 10-15 minutes?).  Otherwise there will be lots of "false</i><br>
<i>&gt; alarms" due to innocuous activity, which will require human attention and</i><br>
<i>&gt; thus cost money.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
if it is a phone based system, just have a phone jack on the unit, so the user
can plug themselves in... easy as pie, and there are already hundreds of
millions of phone jacks already out there.
