<a href="2045.html#2049qlink1">&gt;I do not understand why Japanese savers do not invest more of their money</a><br>

<p>
<a name="2109qlink2">Because the Japanese government made it illegal in order to provide</a> cheap 
internal investment capital (hence they were able to do things that no 
western company paying 10% interest could dream of. this also caused the 
property bubble which lead to down town Tokyo being valued more highly 
than most of California put together.

<p>
Now they no longer need the investment capital and could valuably shift 
the policy to one of external investment, but it is to late to sell those 
Yen for their 1980s price.

PS: this is not as simple as i have made seem: there are many biollions 
of dollars worth of Japanese Yen-backed investments in the West, just not 
enough to pay wages for two hundred  million septuagenarians. ;-(
