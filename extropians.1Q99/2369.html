&lt;excerpt&gt;outflow near some sparking kapton wire, and BOOM. Moreover,
since the tank was mostly empty,

its volume was not entirely a vapor version of the fuel. It was air
filled with fuel fumes.

It is an ideally explosive setup. Ideal mixing, minimum swirl, etc.

<p>
&lt;/excerpt&gt;Wow thanks Mike!  Finally an explanation that makes some sense.
 Altho 

<p>
perhaps not entirely comforting to a flequent fryer.  {8-[   So I really
did 

<p>
misunderstand the report, which I thought was saying the explosion
somehow 

<p>
happened inside the tank, not due to ignition outside.  This explanation 

<p>
sounds like fuel fumes leaking out, then igniting.  OK, now we have 

<p>
beaten *that* subject thoroughly to death... {8^D

<p>
  IAN: It's not true that the NTSB 

<p>
  says there was an ignition external

<p>
  to the tank.
