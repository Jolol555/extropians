This is true for an exponential model, but not for a hyperbolic model
or a discontinuous model. I feel that the discontinuous model is the
most valid.

I didn't say that I intend to protect the earth, I merely saind that I
will not intentionally  harm it. I feel that the singularity is inevitable,
and I feel that we cannot predict its outcome. the outcome is either good or
bad. If bad, a delay is of little worth. If good, a delay is of substantial
harm (specifically, to those who die during the delay.) Since any reasomable
projection that does not include a singularity ends in catastrophe, A "good"
singularity is our best bet.

My preferred SI is a sort of collective consciousness that includes
substantially independent sub-entities, some of which are or derive from humans.
I have no reason to believe that the SI will organize itself this way,
but it's the best chance for individuality.
