<a name="1974qlink1">If horizontal velocity translates into vertical
velocity such that it will allow an object to fall
faster than an object dropped in a vacuum, as some
here suggest, then why did the wing from PAN AM 103 
(which didn't shoot upwards and thus fell with all 
its horizontal velocity) not fall faster than the 
rate of fall from zero velocity in a vacuum? 

<p>
The wing from PAN AM 103 fell from 31,000 to 0 
in around 46.5 seconds, yet an object dropped 
from 31,000 would fall 34,750 feet in that 
same time period in a vacuum. What gives?
Why didn't the much-touted translation work?

<p>
See: <a href="http://www.corazon.com/103page43wreckanaly3.html">http://www.corazon.com/103page43wreckanaly3.html</a> 

<p>
The wing has the most aerodynamically favorable shape 
<a name="1966qlink1">of just about any part of the plane, so it had everything
 in its favor. So, why didn't it fall faster?
</a>
This nulls the argument against my initial post,
for there's no reason to believe Galileoian
law would be bypassed by horizontal velocity.
