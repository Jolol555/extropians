<p>
Since Environmental News Service published accounts on 
jets spraying "contrails" that make people sick, I have 
seen an explosion of such accounts. While there has been
a track record of military experimental spraying over U.S. 
cities, it is unclear to me whether the recent widespread 
claims of a correlation between contrails and sickness are 
accurate or are perhaps a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy
(<a href="http://assiniboinec.mb.ca/user/downes/fallacy/posthoc.htm">http://assiniboinec.mb.ca/user/downes/fallacy/posthoc.htm</a>). 

<p>
After getting reports of unusual contrail formations in my 
area, I went out and observed and photographed a surprising
proliferation of contrails. I've concluded that attributes 
assumed to indicate a contrail is spray are attributes of
normal contrails under variable atmospheric conditions. 

<p>
I took many photographs, some of which provide proof that
assumed-to-be-abnormal attributes of contrails are normal,
and as such are not evidence of spraying. See my analysis 
with photos: <a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/contrail.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/contrail.htm</a> 

<p>
Accounts that my observations do not address are those of 
"cobwebs," "angel hair," or a gel-like substance falling.
There was one inexplicable contrail that I photographed.
