<a name="0304qlink1"><a href="0210.html#0227qlink1">&gt;&gt; If you dropped back a hundred thousand years, how long would it take you</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; to out-invent hunters who had been using spears all their life?  Skill</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; is a poor substitute for smartness.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0210.html#0227qlink2">&gt;I wonder how well I could build all those waterwheels, metal melting,</a><br>
<i>&gt;steam engines and Volta cells. Have you tried to recreate technology?</i><br>
<i>&gt;And the interesting thing in this example is that in the end it hinges</i><br>
<i>&gt;not on me being a super-genius, but on me knowing things already (and</i><br>
<i>&gt;then needing to somehow implement them, which is the hard part!). </i><br>

<p>
<a href="0210.html#0227qlink3">&gt;It would be interesting to drop you off on an isolated island together</a><br>
<i>&gt;with a randomly selected but stupid survivalist. Would your superior</i><br>
<i>&gt;intellect bring you more food?</a> </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0304qlink2"><a href="0210.html#0227qlink4">&gt;I would rather say smartness is a poor substitute for skill, which is</a><br>
<i>&gt;why we tend to rely on learned skills rather than problem solving for</i><br>
<i>&gt;most tasks we do.</i><br>

<p>
Yes.  I remember thinking about this after watching "A Connecticut 
Yankee in King Arthur's Court" with the Bing-meister.  I would want to 
take along my four volume set of "How Things Work".</a>  

<p>
<a href="0210.html#0227qlink5">&gt;&gt; And if it's stumped, it can get the answers off the Internet, just like</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I do.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0210.html#0227qlink6">&gt;OK, here is a question: how do I design a good robot body? Assume no</a><br>
<i>&gt;prior knowledge beyond a common sense database about the world,</i><br>
<i>&gt;including no experience with being physical, no scientific education,</i><br>
<i>&gt;no engineering education.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0245qlink1">Good Question.  First off,  I would want to be able to fly, very fast</a> if I 
<a name="0245qlink2">wanted to.  I would also want to be able to breath either air OR water.
I guess I would generally want to be as mobile as possible.  I would also 
want to greatly increase my sensory range . . . visually, auditorally,</a> etc.

<p>
<a name="0245qlink3">I'm no engineer so I can't imagine how this can be arranged, but I prefer 
to continue to experiece the good Earth, rather than upload into a virtual 
existence.
