Eliezer,

<p>
You seem to be taking great umbrage to the fact that I feel you are
misunderstanding what I said in my earlier posts.  Rest assured that that
happens to everyone at some time or another.

<p>
You should have noticed that I made no "claim" as to how your mind works,
only a hypothesis of projection (and not even a hypothesis as to what was
being projected) based on my perceptions of your mangling of my posts.
Note the "seems to be" and "I do not know Eliezer" formulations -- I chose
those words very carefully to express tentativeness, though you
acknowledged them only for rhetorical purposes.  I could easily have said
something Freudian like "Eliezer is projecting his deep-seated belief of
_x_ into my posts," but I did not (I still don't even have an idea of what
I would put in place of _x_, were I to make such a statement).  You may
have published so many bytes on how minds work that you can make
assumptions about the cognitive etiology of my posts, but this is something
I did not do, and disavowed the ability to do, despite your assertion to
the contrary.

<p>
All I was trying to get across is that you were setting up strawmen that
you attributed to me in order to make your points.  I agree with most of
your points, particularly the ones that are still being discussed in this
topic (and on which, from my perspective, you are still setting up
strawmen), but for some reason you can't see that.

<p>
Maybe that reason is my fault, maybe it's yours.  However, I see no value
in publicly continuing a discussion about whether you understood my posts,
as it is unrelated to the purposes of the list.  You may post whatever you
like in response, and you may rest assured you can have the last word, no
matter how distorted I may feel your comments to be (that should satisfy
your unreferenced "Rules," if I may hazard an assumption as to how they
might work).  I hardly see any value in continuing such a discussion
privately, but I could be wrong and you are welcome to email me if you feel
there might be some value.

<p>
Tim
