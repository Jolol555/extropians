Sadly, not true. Fortunately many of these systems will only fail during
the rollover and will probably start working again if restarted. There
are various reasons why embedded systems use non-compliant clocks, for
example for maintenance schedules or because they have the clock built
into the chip so they use it for event timing, etc.

<p>
If this wasn't true, corporations wouldn't be spending billions of dollars
replacing all the broken embedded systems...

<p>
That said, I don't see a long-term power shutdown as likely. Short-term
failures in small areas, certainly, but not the entire grid going down
for months.

I wouldn't be entirely surprised if Clinton is aiming to use the Y2K
chaos to stay in power, even to the extent of martial law; but I would
be surprised if the military obey him beyond a rational response to the
situation. Of all the groups who hate Clinton, the military seem to come
top, for obvious reasons. I'd be more concerned if Clinton was kicked
out of office and Gore took over.

<p>
I mean, as far as I can see Clinton is a true Orwellian villain who cares
for nothing but power, and he's not going to turn down a chance like this.
