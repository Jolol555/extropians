T0Morrow@aol.com said roughly
<br>
<a href="2753.html#2791qlink1">&gt; Randy Barnett has written extensively on the benefits of.  I've found quite</a><br>
<i>&gt; convincing [Randy Barnett's] arguments requiring that criminals pay their</i><br>
<i>&gt; victims receive restitution, as an alternative to imprisoning or killing</i><br>
criminals.

<p>
The proviso I would add is that the restitution has to be full and complete.
Typically what happens now is someone burns your car, they get caught, the
restitutive judge says "oh, you have to make restitution" and that is that.
They do not take into account enforcing this and setting a time limit.

<p>
Plus, what do you do with the typical criminal who even if you enslaved him
for a year would not be worth the damage he did?
