<a name="1643qlink4">Tell me Michael, why haven't the gun manufacturers gotten together</a> to create their

</a>
</a>
realize that if they cooperate they can survive as an<a name="1643qlink7"> industry rather than watch
themselves be run out of business through increasing regulation?  If Cleveland

retaliate by refusing to sell any<a name="1643qlink9"> guns to their law enforcement as well.  Such

retaliation would quickly turn<a name="1643qlink10"> the table back in their favor.  If it *is* in their

corporate interest, why<a name="1643qlink11"> haven't they done this Michael? Such a tactic is so obvious,
why have they ignored it?  Is continuing their business as usual into oblivion in

<a name="1626qlink3">In regards to the Democrat vs Republican run CIA, I was attempting to be
tongue-and-cheek by pointing out that both the Democrats and Republicans have their
rhetoric and methods, but the end result is the same under either - a lessening of
liberty for those under their rule.  Sorry if you took it as an in depth analysis of
20th century intelligence community activities - something I'm won't pretend I'm
knowledgeable enough to do.</a>  :-)
