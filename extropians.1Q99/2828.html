While the stats for the two below are rather easy to establish,</a> the one above is
<a name="2832qlink4">not, and I doubt you will get many people agreeing on the criteria</a> to measure
it. For example:

<p>
<a name="2832qlink5">in 'handling' a gun, do you mean the amount of time it is actually</a> in hand being
<a name="2832qlink6">fired? If that is the only criterion you accept then</a> you are obviously trying to
<a name="2832qlink7">skew the stats.

<p>
Since a gun is a deterrent weapon, (esp. seeing as how the FBI</a> estimates that
<a name="2832qlink8">guns are used in defense against criminals 2 million times a year without
firing, merely being brandished) merely carrying a gun on one's person</a> or having
<a name="2832qlink9">one close at hand ( in the glove box, in your desk, in your night stand,</a> etc.)
<a name="2832qlink10">should count as 'time handling a gun'. If you accept this, I think</a> you will find
<a name="2832qlink11">that time handling a gun is actually much higher than either</a> of the two below. I
<a name="2832qlink12">personally spend an hour or so in the bathroom a day, and maybe two hours</a> a day
<a name="2832qlink13">on the road. I am carrying or have my gun close at hand 24/7. I spend 2-</a>4 hours
<a name="2832qlink14">a week firing guns on the practice range (mostly skeet, though I try</a> to pop off
<a name="2832qlink15">a few mags on my 9mm at least once a week or so). I think</a> that you will find
<a name="2832qlink16">that most gun owners who aren't just collectors have similar habits.</a> Most at
<a name="2832qlink17">least keep one close at hand in the bedroom for night time security,</a> which would
<a name="2832qlink18">make their 'handling' rate about 6-10 hours a day.

<p>

<a href="2822.html#2828qlink2">&gt; 2) Average time spent in bathroom</a><br>
<i>&gt; 3) Average time spent in car</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not trying to manipulate data... I'm trying to use some meaningful</i><br>
<i>&gt; statistics. For example, people might say that bees are more</a> dangerous than</i><br>
<a name="2832qlink19"><i>&gt; great white sharks, simply because there are a greater number</a> of bee deaths</i><br>
<a name="2832qlink20"><i>&gt; than great white deaths... you get where I'm going with this.</i><br>

<p>
Yes I do. Try it out and see where you get. Counting 'handling' as having</a> a gun
<a name="2832qlink21">on one's person or close at hand is exactly like time spent in an</a> idling car at
<a name="2832qlink22">a stoplight (one of the higher risk situations to be in, in a car,</a> as a matter
<a name="2832qlink23">of fact.) or stuck in traffic.
