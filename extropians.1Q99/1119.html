I have a few questions.
<p>
     First of all, I am one who believes in the hope associated with 
cryonics. After enlisting with the services of a angency like Alcor, 
they retain money's or insurance to freeze you after death. This is all 
in the hopes for future technology do one day have advanced to the point 
of correcting, the error leading you to death. But last night, I was 
fearfuly thinking: when they are paid, and the time has come to return, 
say that there are some who are so to speak scientific giunnea pigs. But 
with the amount of people having this procedure done, won't there be too 
many for just the goverment or medical practice?<a name="1129qlink3"> Then who will save us, 
only the freezing has been paid for, no one has been paid in advance to 
save us and bring us back?</a>
<p>
<a name="1129qlink4">    Also, I'm wondering, will it at all be possible to bring someone 
backk from our memory banks alone?</a>
