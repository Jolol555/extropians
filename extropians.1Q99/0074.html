Borges. I recommend his stories, they are lovely mindbending
stuff. Very much like M.C. Escher.

Well, it took me 6 months to finish Zen and the Brain, with occasional
long sittings (on the bus, on airplanes, in the Grand Canyon - my copy
even has a faint red tint due to the sandstone dust) and usually a few
short chapters each week. It takes time to read and think about, but
it is worth it. I finished it, symbolically, on New Years Eve.

<p>
It is rather heavy on the neuroscience, but not technical. Austin has
some fairly nice introductions to various systems, both the elementary
stuff about neurons and how the brain works, and some of the more
thrilling subsystems like the brainstem nuclei. I learned a lot. I
think you could read the book, especially if you at the same time read
some intro to neuroscience or neuropsychology - I really recommend
Biological Psychology by Kalat, definitely a book that should be on
transhumanist reading lists. 

<p>
Much of the book is about what Zen is (a rather tricky question), how
it has developed, what it does and what the author has
experienced. Very beautifully written in places. The parts where he
becomes less excellent are where he discuss things he haven't
experienced firsthand or haven't got solid scientific grounding (like
the discussions of ongoing enlightenment), but overall, Austin does a
good job. It is tough going and a long climb, but the view is grand.
