Whoa!  I've never heard any of those religious nuts claim they can PROVE
they're right!  They just argued that their view had a fairly good
probability of being right and was better than any other alternative. 
Fools.  Of course, we both know that only being absolutely certain that
you're right can possibly justify imposing your own views on everyone else.
