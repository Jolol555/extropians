I have a question to pose to the list, and I am hoping to make it aat 
least interesting. The question<a name="2161qlink1"> is, does anyone know of sources for 
studying Cognitive Science and Psychiatry?</a> I am getting more interested 
in these fields, and am looking to eventually practise these 
professionally. I have a long way to go, so even basic sources, how to 
get in to graduate schools, backgrounds, etc. 
The reason for my interest, and why I think this list might be the place 
to look/discuss, is something odd I've noticed about very intelligent. I 
know my own IQ is fairly high (to risk immodesty in order to get to the 
point), and most of my friends seem intellectually the same. The problem 
is that so many of them are, besides being highly intelligent, prone to 
<a name="2161qlink2">self-sabotage. They've bought into believing that they're not 'worthy' 
<a name="2162qlink2"><a name="2161qlink3">of success, that being bright somehow makes them bad, etc.</a> My interest 
</a>
</a>
is in studying both how this comes about, and how to cure it. How do 
ideas trasnlate into changes in the brains physical structure, how to 
reverse these changes, etc. I am hoping this list finds this 
sufficiently relevant, interesting, etc. 
Thanks,
