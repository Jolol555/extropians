Please do. Anytime someone talks about cures for seemingly intractable diseases,
using 'nutritional supplements', despite the positive results of natural
anti-oxidants, etc., my bogosity meter gets extra twitchy. While the potential
benefits of useful products are huge, as in the case of drugs like tamoxifen, etc
from natural sources, I'm sure I can speak for most everyone here in saying it is
extremely important that any health-cap startup using the term extropian in its name
not be a fly by night operation long on hype and short on science. If I so much as
hear the word multi-level.....

<p>
I think you understand where I am coming from. Despite what I know about both
naturally originating substances, as well as proactive marketing plans, the negative
connotations in the eyes of the public due to the indiscretions of others carry an
extra risk factor. Please be as forthcoming as possible.... I personally love the
fact that you are trying to naturally recusitate a moribumd local economy.
