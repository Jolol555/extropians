I was browsing through Strout's mind uploading page, probably a favorite of
many on this list:

I came across the part about using MRI to scan a living brain for
non-destructive uploading.  One of the obstacles is insufficient resolution.
I remember hearing that the effective resolution of something (say, a
telescope) can be increased by taking a series of time-separated or
spatially-separated images and combining them using image processing
algorithms.  Couldn't this same technique be used to complement an otherwise
inadequate technology?  For example, could you use slight movements of the
scanner to construct a higher resolution image?  Is there a limit to how far
resolution can be enhanced with techniques like this?  I guess this would
amount to trading CPU power for resolution power (if only other commodity
types could be exchanged, we'd probably have strong nanotech by now!)

<p>
One of the ideas I found useful from this list is the fact that many
breakthroughs tend to occur when one or more new discoveries is coupled with
one or more mundane/existing technologies.  Ever since learning this, I've
tried to think of ways things can be combined.  Synergy and all that!

<p>
I've been a lurker on this list for a few years (would you believe it!)  I
have a 7000 message backlog, but am gradually wading through them by
subject.
