<p>
That is the hope.

<p>

<i>&gt; be a better place with some subset of humanity's atoms used to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; better purpose, I am more committed to rationality than to humanity.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3596qlink1">That is the rub, but that is also the point of the testing process. If you
gave your word to first do no harm, would you keep your word on mere
principle, even if humanity's ability to get you if you don't keep your word
is non-existent? Picking people whose sense of identity is deeply integrated
with their sense of personal integrity.</a>

<p>
I think that this is the big wall that will limit  us reaching the
singularity. It won't be an issue of technology, but integrity and trust.

<p>
I can imagine that to overcome this block, the first x number of uploads will
not only have to clear a battery of tests, but will also have to agree to the
imposition of hard wired restrictions like Asimov's Laws until a predetermined
number of individuals have been uploaded, so that the impact of any one
individual can be mitigated by the rest. Say, 10,000 individuals.

<p>

<a href="3588.html#3590qlink3">&gt; I am an altruist specifically because it serves my needs--I can't</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3598qlink1">Yes, but I think with the above proposal, the altruist motivator can be
maintained. What do you think?
