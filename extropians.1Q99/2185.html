<a href="2161.html#2185qlink1">&gt;... I've noticed about very intelligent [people are] prone to</a><br>
<i>&gt;self-sabotage. They've bought into believing that they're not 'worthy'</i><br>
<i>&gt;of success, that being bright somehow makes them bad, etc.</a></i><br>

<p>
I believe the 66 2/3% bulge of any bell curve can act as a gravitational
(like) attractor of immense power. There is a continual mimetic tidal force
constantly clawing at the outliers. Those to the left are an economic drag.
Those to the right are a social and economic threat. Just be like us...or
die.

<p>
I believe that the advent of liberal capitalism, materialism and the
military industrial complex have been the major factors which have made the
reviling and/or killing of +140 IQ individuals an economically poor
decision. Prior to those events, there was no particular benefit to
intelligence, because everyone was "going to heaven" and reading was
something that was done by the weird, and satanic. Just look at the "heroes
of ancient science". They did their work in secret so as to avoid criminal
prosecution and death. Newton, DaVinci, Servetus, Galileo. Now, if they kill
us, we will stop making their cool gadgets. We're tolerated for the shiny
stuff we make for the bulge.

<p>
The fact is, that when a 2 or &gt; sigma individual is growing up, they are
likely to be so different from their parents, peers, that they (we) are
rejected as not able to fit in, and therefore not worthy to fit in.
Rejection by parents/peers is the ultimate psychological injury. The natural
result to a young biological organism which needs love and positive
reinforcement is depression, and neurotic behaviour, followed by a lifelong
expectation of rejection which often becomes a self fulfilling prophesy.

<p>
Prior to the web, we got together in universities if we could happen to
afford it. Now, we have lists which provide us with our very own "planet".
