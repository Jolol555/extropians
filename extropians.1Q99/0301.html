<p>
Why 'shell'? This is free environment. The grey grow as a thin
layer over organical materials. Grey cannot function under anaerobic 
conditions. Of course distinct erosion pattern, or even cooperative 
behaviour could evolve, which transports oxygen actively within volume

If the capability to erode diamondoid has evolved, the capability to
thrive in unstable environments will not be long to follow.
