Yes, pass as much credit around to others, don't hog up all the good ideas
first, and break your work up into little digestible and easily buried

Unfortunately, the bean counters have been doing this to scientists with
foresight ever since Newton published his Principia....Fortunately, nobody
remembers much about the bean counters.
