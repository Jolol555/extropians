<i>&gt; &gt;As driving is a stressful activity, time saved from it will likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;reduce mortality from other reasons.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Add to this the unaccounted factors mentioned in the beginning of this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;message, and also considerations that reliance upon police instead of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;common sense is not good for personal development, that it takes more</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;human life time to pay police expenses for enforcing speed limits,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;that people who save time are usually more careful and more productive</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;than people who speed unreasonably (and don't have to suffer for their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stupidity) - and you will see that *higher speed limits save lives*.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; One problem with your argument.  when you are speeding, you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; necessaitly hit another speeding person.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If I'm doing 50 and you're doing 90 and you hit me, it wasn't my fault and</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm dead too.</i><br>

<a name="0771qlink1">Here's a question: Does the study examine differences in the range of speeds
used on the same roads at the same time? I would imagine that if everyone were
going 80 mph they would be driving much more safely than if people on a
highway were driving a range of speeds from 50-80. I'm sure that if everyone
were driving 80 they'd have a higher risk during the time they were driving
than if everyone were driving 50, but they would also be on the road at least
40% less time than those driving 50, so their overall cumulative risk may be
lower even though their minute by minute risk may be higher,</a> as you
calculated.
