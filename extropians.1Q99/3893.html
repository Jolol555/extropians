Good point - although I think we have to put them in the 'tried but failed'
category.  If they had been on Mars the whole group would have been dead
pretty quickly.

Yes.  I am also unimpressed by the amount of effort the crew had to invest
in just growing their food.  Our Martian colonists need a situation like
modern America, where 1% of the people can grow food for the other 99%.
With their methods we'd be looking at more like 90% farmers.
