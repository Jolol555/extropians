  IAN: Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) defined the rate at 
  which falling bodies accelerate near the Earth, which 
  has more recently been determined to be 9.8 meters per 
  second squared in a vacuum. 357 years after his death, 
  the physical truths Galileo helped to define are still 
  being denied and desecrated by the ruling authorities.

<p>
<a name="1883qlink1">  The distance any object near the Earth will fall from 
  rest in a vacuum in 29 seconds is 13,500 feet. However, 
<a name="1893qlink1">  the CIA proclaims that FLT800 fell from the apex of a
  dramatic climb (and thus from rest)</a> 17,000 feet in only
  29 seconds, and that's NOT in a vacuum! The CIA scenario
  violates Galileoian physical law by a very wide margin.</a>

<p>
  PROOF:<a name="1891qlink1"> The distance an object will fall from rest in a 
  given time (t) in a vacuum is found with the equation 
  (.5 * g * t^2),</a> where "g" the gravitational acceleration 
  near the Earth. So all we need to plug in is the 29 
  seconds and we will know how far any object will fall
  near the Earth in vacco, which reveals to one and all: 

<p>
  Fall distance = (.5 * 9.8 * 29^2) = 4,120 m = 13,500 feet 

<p>
  The U.S. Government claims that an object would fall about 
  25% faster than the physical law defined by Galileo allows,
  and if we add in the slowing effect of atmospheric drag, the
  violation of Galileoian law is even more horrendous. Our 
  Govt and Galileo cannot both be right at the same time,
  therefore, either the physics books or the official 
  FLT800 scenario must be rewritten. Logic dictates.

<p>
  So the facts Galileo set out to define are still working 
  centuries later to topple the claims of tyrannical authoritarian
   structures, unfortunately, like in Galileo's day, 
  those who question the authorities are often so assaulted
  by the authoritarian establishment, that they are compelled 
  to recant their views, just like Galileo was centuries ago.
