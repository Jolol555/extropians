<p>
There is a big difference between supressing technology and making technology
pay for its externalizations. Spam is specifically designed to be almost total
externalized cost, which is why it is such a threat. Using legal mechanisms or
market pressure to make technologies pay their externalized costs will not
supress the rate of technological advancement in the long term (i.e. more than a
few years), since the bandwidth waste that spam causes is as bad as smog, toxic
waste, or other types of pollution. They are evidence of a technology which
wastes resources, is inefficient. Maximizing technological growth depends on
minimizing the utility costs of productive work in an economic system. Spam is
none of these.--
