Hmmm... &lt;drums fingers on desk&gt;...  That's actually a pretty good
objection.  Maybe an alternate version would be a good idea.  Still, as
a slogan, I think the first version is slightly better.

<a name="3087qlink5">What I'm saying is not that we are going to COERCE the world into the
future, but that a lot of people, as always, are going to try to hide
under the blanket, kick up a big stink, and outlaw every form of
technology more complicated than a Whitney gin.  We are going to have to
deal with technophobia.</a>

<p>
<a name="3087qlink6">One of the things a cause needs is a problem to overcome, and it does
help if the problem is political.  I'm treading on really thin ice by
doing that, but as long as I imply reluctance rather than evil
opposition, I haven't crossed the divide into hate-mongering (UNLIKE
people who use the term "entropians", by the way).  The Extropian quest
is not purely technological; we have memes to overcome.

<p>
In point of actual fact, the planet WILL go into the future "kicking and
screaming" and it will have to be dragged.  It always has been.

<p>
Which makes a nice reply to the people who walk up to you and want to
talk to you about the "kicking and screaming" part.  "Oh, no, we don't
want to force anyone; it's just that part of the problem is the media
getting hysterical about things like cloning and genetic engineering." 
(If challenged, add "There are legitimate issues, but they aren't
raised; there's too much panic-mongering and sensationalism.")</a>

<p>
<a name="3083qlink1">Finally, and most importantly, "lead" isn't quite as vivid as "drag,
kicking and screaming".  I can't think of an equally good phrase offhand.
