<a href="3292.html#3297qlink2">&gt; &gt;and considering that the</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;average millionaire actually pays taxes in the 14% range indicates that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; rich</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;will actually pay more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; First, you pay federal income taxes on your current income, not your net</i><br>
<i>&gt; worth.  Thus, net worth is not a good indicator of effective tax rate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Secondly,  the top marginal tax rate in the U.S. is 39.6%.  Since this rate</i><br>
<i>&gt; applies to income over $200,000 its obviously wrong to think that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "average" top-tier income earner's effective tax rate is 14%.  Also, Forbes</i><br>
<i>&gt; plan eliminates taxation of capital gains and interest.  70% of all capital</i><br>
<i>&gt; gains and interest income is realized by the top 5% of American society.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Here we have a tax rate change from 28%/20% to 0%. It is quite clear that</i><br>
<i>&gt; under Forbes flat tax proposal (and the others as well) that the upper and</i><br>
<i>&gt; upper middle class will receive all of the tax benefit.  Furthermore,</i><br>
<i>&gt; according to the Treasury, 69% of the tax benefit generated by Forbes plan</i><br>
<i>&gt; inures to the top 3%.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3385qlink4">The top marginal tax rate may be set at that level, but the only people</a> who pay
<a name="3385qlink5">it are those who do not follow the advice of their tax accountant.</a> former Pres.
<a name="3385qlink6">George Bush, for example, and his wife filed a tax return in either 90</a> or 91
<a name="3385qlink7">which showed that their income was nearly a million dollars, yet</a> their final tax
<a name="3385qlink8">bill came to only 14% of their income.</a>

<p>
<a name="3385qlink9">Your claim about the tax benefits going to the top 3% are true only if</a> you keep
<a name="3385qlink10">existing tax loopholes, and expect (paradoxically) that everyone</a> is now paying
<a name="3385qlink11">the maximum percentage for their tax bracket, as if they were not using</a> and tax
<a name="3385qlink12">loopholes. Obviously this is cooking the books.

<p>
<a href="3292.html#3297qlink3">&gt; The flat tax promotes the myth that a simpler tax code must incorporate a</a><br>
<i>&gt; single tax rate regime.  This is absolutely wrong.  Forbes, Archer</a> and other</i><br>
<a name="3385qlink13"><i>&gt; GOP disciples are attempting to capitalize on the average American's</i><br>
<i>&gt; ignorance of the complexities of the tax system.  The complexity in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; current tax system is not the progressive tax rate (there are 4 or 5 tax</i><br>
<i>&gt; rates which are very easy to follow).  The complexity in the current tax</i><br>
<i>&gt; system is determining what is "taxable income".</i><br>

<p>
The problem with a 'progressive' system is that it is easy</a> to hide loopholes for
<a name="3385qlink14">the rich in there, but not so easy with a flat system. The rich get 90%</a> of the
tax loopholes.

<p>
<a name="3385qlink15"><i>&gt; We can keep the progressive</i><br>
<a href="3292.html#3297qlink4">&gt; tax concept (i.e., higher income earners pay a larger portion of their</a><br>
<i>&gt; earnings than lower earners) while simplifying the tax code.  But</a> why would</i><br>
<a name="3385qlink16"><i>&gt; Forbes and others want to do that when they can captalize on the public's</i><br>
<i>&gt; distaste for the current tax system by deceiving them into supporting</a> a huge</i><br>
<a name="3385qlink17"><i>&gt; tax cut for Forbes and the rest of his wealthy buddies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
How about because, as the stock market indicates, when people</a> are allowed to
<a name="3385qlink18">keep their money, rather than it being confiscated, the economy</a> grows faster,
<a name="3385qlink19">thus increasing tax revinues. Its called dynamic scoring.
