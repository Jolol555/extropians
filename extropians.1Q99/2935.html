I read it.  It's by an author named Nancy Kress I beleive.  It is part of a
</a>
series.  I think it's the second of perhaps three.

<a name="2956qlink2">It was an OK read....but I didn't get too excited about it.  I'm not sure why.
Perhaps it rubbed me wrong politically or philisophically.  I don't think I'd
call it libertarian.  In fact perhaps the opposite...</a>

<p>
But it's been several years since I read it so my memory of it may be wrong.
