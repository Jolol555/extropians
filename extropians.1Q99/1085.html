<p>
Hans Moravec has been making the same point in recent years. I haven't seen
his new book, but a couple of years ago he showed me a graph from the book
in progress clearly making this point. The acceleration is acclerating.
Tighten your safety belts!
 
<p>
<a href="1083.html#1085qlink2">&gt;* He talked about how exponential advances seem small at first, then</a><br>

<p>
Yes, in his book, Kurzweil makes this point very strongly.

<i>&gt;A: Much of human creativity involves drawing connections between</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;   </i><br>
<i>&gt;I forgot the examples. </i><br>

<p>
His book has plenty of excellent examples. He gives a URL for downloading
his own poetry-writing program (RKCP) that does a fine job of emulating
various styles. You can get that from www.kurzweiltech.com  Here's a great
Haiku that his software came up with:

<p>
Crazy moon child
<br>
Hide from your coffin
<br>
To spite your doom.

<p>
<a href="1083.html#1085qlink4">&gt; I still haven't looked at "The Age of</a><br>
<i>&gt;Spiritual Machines", and probably won't (my backlog is way too big),</i><br>
<i>&gt;but based on the talk I saw I'd recommend the book to someone</i><br>
<i>&gt;unfamiliar with but interested in the subject.</i><br>

<p>
I finished the book a couple of days ago and highly recommend it. It is not
a comprehensive overview of all things transhumanist, but does an excellent
job from the computational aspect.

<p>
Onward!
