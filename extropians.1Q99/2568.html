They weren't using force at all, IIUC, first or otherwise.  While it is
true that some of the people they listed were killed, I think it extremely
unlikely that the killers did it *because* they saw this on the internet
(if they even did).

I think it is good that they stopped, but bad that they *were* stopped,</a>
if you get my meaning. :(  Unless specified otherwise in individual
