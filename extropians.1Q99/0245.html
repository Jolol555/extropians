I did some interesting work on this topic a while back - all very
back-of-the-envelope stuff, but the potential seems promising.  If you
assume advanced biotech, primitive nanotech, and good automated engineering,
you should be able to do really neat stuff.

<p>
A biomechanical body capable of surviving any environment on Earth should be
feasible (just stay away from lava flows).  Using a diamondoid skeleton and
layers of diamondoid mesh below the skin you could be pretty much
bulletproof, too.

<p>
Flying is a big power hog - you could use folding wings with arrays of
micromotor fans for lift, but I don't think you can run it for long without
a nuclear power source.  Of course, you probably aren't worried about modest
radiation levels at that point, so a radioactive decay battery might be
feasible.

<p>
The only real problem with sensory enhancements is that you need to modify
your brain to be able to handle the extra information.  If you can do that,
you should be able to pack an active/passive sonar system, wide-spectrum
omnidirectional vision (wavelengths from several cm to somewhere in the far
UV / soft X-ray region), and very acute taste/smell into a humanoid body
with no problems.  Wearing clothing would interfere with the vision, of
course - you need to use most of your body area as a sensor for the longer
wavelengths.

<p>
If you want to get really fancy it should be possible to add some completely
new senses as well - magnetic field 'vision' and mass detectors would be
obvious candidates.
