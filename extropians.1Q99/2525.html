<a href="2506.html#2525qlink1">&gt; &gt;A Davidson just got added to my glorify list by implementing Brian Atkins</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;suggestion to</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; With this system in place we could log into a web page and check what our</i><br>
<i>&gt; kook rating or glory rating is as well, and perhaps be presented options to</i><br>
<i>&gt; modify/delete/add our filters. The behavior of the commands could even be</i><br>
<i>&gt; customized, to some degree, via a web interface.</i><br>

<p>
That works for me with the stipulation that one decides to kookify or
glorify based not on previous postings but only on those postings after
the system is in place.  I have read and learned much in the past year,
but if I looked back, I fear I would slip deep into the kooky range.  {8-[

<p>
Newbies could be alowed a couple months after first post, or
twenty free posts before they are kookified.  This would have
helped me too, as I was introduced to extropians thru a wildly cool
ideas futures game on the web, by Anders I think.  For some time,
I thought extropians was an extension of, or somehow directly
related to, ideas futures.  So, I misunderstood.

<p>
Cheerfully I report feeling somewhat less kooky now, although
not yet exactly glorious.  {8^D spike
