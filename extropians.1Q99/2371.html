agreed that
<br>
<a href="2313.html#2371qlink1">&gt;&gt;  Definitions are the sine qua none of understanding: they are the only proof</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  that we have an understanding.</i><br>

<p>
but thought that I should not
<br>
&gt; be so defensive to religionists?  Atheists and other idealogues (such as
&gt; Hitler and Stalin) also do these bad things.

<p>
Well, when people advocate Stalinism I will be on their case too ;-)

<p>
Of course these two are quite like religion-leaders; they relied on
"charisma" and power, two things which for some unknown reason we respect.
In organizational psychology there are theories of leadership built around
charisma - they really are frightening to behold: arguing in effect that we
should design enterprises to run on blind faith.

<p>
My wish is that people never do Anything at the point of a gun or for which
there is no evidence.

<p>
<a href="2313.html#2371qlink2">&gt;&gt;  Actually, the one person whom i respect most on this list (not</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  saying who) is also the person whom i would predict would be the most kind</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  and for whom I would, never having met them, do most anything.</i><br>

<p>
&gt; Why not say who it is?  Can't we let people know it when we admire them?  Is
&gt; this reticense an extropian meme?

<p>
Because I was frightened of earning someone's wrath who recently criticized
me for personifying positions ;-) It is interesting I guess that those who
demand tolerance of others views often actually create fear of dissent. We
see this all the time in academia. A good antidote and tonic is reading
Thomas Sowell's book "inside American education".

<p>
If you buy a book of his, i recommend this one "The vision of the anointed:
self congratulation as a basis for social policy".
