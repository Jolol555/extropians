In fact, recent studies have shown that the Russian nuclear capability, numbers of
warheads, has dropped below the limits of the proposed Start II treaty, which are
half the levels of the (still unratified by the Russian State Duma) START I treaty.
While we aren't anywhere near in as sad a shape, we still haven't complied with
START I because the Russians refuse to ratify it, even though we have ratified it on
our part. Iraq and North Korea are the only ones whe seem stupid enough to actually
want to use nuclear weapons, while the India/Pakistan exchange of tests was merely
bringing into the open capabilities which have, in fact, existed since the 1970's
(when India did, in fact, test one device) to no adverse actions. I think that if
nations like Pakistan are smart enough not to use nukes in real life, and other
countries like South Africa are smart enough to actually disband their programs and
give up nuclear capability, it says something significant in opposition to the
position above.
