<i>&gt;  US scientists have genetically-engineered chickens to grow basic "legs"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  instead of wings.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Researchers at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, took a gene</i><br>

<i>&gt;  of chick embryos.</i><br>

	for one thing, im fairly sure that this isnt particularly comfy, from the
chickens POV. is that relevent?  do chickens have rights, from an extropian
POV?  if they dont, and our desire for chicken legs causes us to grow chickens
that are really just masses of legs, where do we stop?  should we? cows that
<a name="3196qlink1">are really just massive mammeries would be... interisting.  what about pigs
that have asses the size of a buick?  wouldnt run outa ham for a while...
<p>
	basicly, im just wondering about the lists opinion on the ethics of this, and
indeed, if theres even grounds for a problem.</a></a>

sayke   (who is waiting for the discovery of the gene sequence responsible for
the growth of infrared sensors in pit vipers. wheee a couple of those babies
woud kick ass... who needs nightvision goggles when youve got the same thing
built into your head?)
