Who brought ethics into this?  My point was simply that what we've been
talking about is a genie machine, capable of doing essentially anything a
full-blown SI could do.  If such machines exist, anyone who has one can
easily use it to make an actual SI.  Therefore, a world where ordinary
humans commonly have access to genie machines can't exist - the age of
SI/AI/IE would begin before the nanotech age could really get going.

On another topic:

&gt; Sorry, no. You are being hopelessly narrowminded. All that is needed is<br>
for
<br>
<a href="1113.html#1156qlink5">&gt; sufficient force to crack the crust of the planet enough so that it breaks</a><br>
up
<br>
<a href="1113.html#1156qlink6">&gt; like an ice floe. The impacts are merely catalysts. Once this is done, the</a><br>
crust
<br>
<a href="1113.html#1156qlink7">&gt; destabilizes and becomes inundated with fresh lava, eventually subducting</a><br>
<i>&gt; everything and a new crust forms. Grey goo gets gutted.</i><br>

<p>
You said:

<p>
<a href="1060.html#1156qlink8">&gt; Get enough impacts going at once and the shock waves will turn the entire</a><br>
<i>&gt; lithosphere (the crust) of the planet to lava.</i><br>

<p>
and:

<p>
<a href="1060.html#1156qlink9">&gt; I would say that 20 asteroids or comets about 20 miles in diameter</a><br>
impacting
<br>
<a href="1060.html#1156qlink10">&gt; at once in a dodecahedral pattern would do the trick.</a><br>

<p>
I demonstrated that this is not the case - impactors typically do not carry
enough energy to melt themselves, let alone the Earth's crust.  Now you
raise an entirely different argument, in the guise of continuing the
previous one.

<p>
Well, fracture calculations are a lot trickier than simple impart energy,
and I'm not going to attempt one.  I will, however, point out that the
concept is meaningless when applied to objects of planetary scale.  The
Earth's crust isn't held in place by mechanical strength (in other words, it
is already full of cracks).  Gravity is the dominant force here - the crust
is a layer of lighter material floating on top of layers of denser rock.  To
get lava to rise to the surface you need to make it less dense than the
surrounding crust, either by heating it or changing its chemical
composition.

<p>
Now, an impact of any reasonable size isn't going to fracture the crust at
all - its too thick, and there isn't enough energy.  If you drop something
really huge (like Ceres) things might be different - but now we're talking
about mega-scale engineering, which is a whole other ball game.

<p>
BTW - from what I've seen, the guys who are actually studying the Alvarez
impacts and the Decca traps make no claims resembling yours.  The closest
I've heard is a theory that the impact might have triggered a series of
eruptions in an area that was already a major center of volcanic activity -
which is a very different claim.
