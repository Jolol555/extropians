  IAN: But at the apex of the climb, it was
  at rest, not traveling straight down 82 mph.
  Watch the video as they show the scenario close 
  up on the jet, it peaks exactly as a baseball
  you throw up would peak, when it starts down,
  it starts from 0 mph. It fell when all it's 
  kinetic energy was spent, shot, zip, zero.
  The 82-MPH-straight-down jet doesn't exist.

<p>
  IAN: There is a time-stamped witnesses account 
  of a commercial pilot on FAA tape, he says
  at exactly 49 seconds after the initial 
  event "we just saw an explosion... it 
  just went down - in the water."

<p>
  While 5 pilots saw the "rocket" or "flare,"
  that pilot, at approx 25 miles away, didn't.
  But his account gives a time stamp, and notice
  that the exploding area (which is no the nose) 
  had to have hit the water not only after the 
  heavy debris, but a few seconds before he said 
  it. Thus, the fall time must be even shorter!! 

<p>
  Hal, thanks for your well-conceived post!
