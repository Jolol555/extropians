<a href="3715.html#3746qlink1">&gt; modules from science and philosophy combining them in whatever way they feel</a><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate to create an entirely unique and flexible course of study. There</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be no set course length and students will be encouraged to 'bring in'</i><br>
<i>&gt; other areas of study and give lectures to other students. I would like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; hierarchy to be non-existent - all active members of the school should be</i><br>
<i>&gt; considered students. Obviously there would have to be some sort of flexible</i><br>
<i>&gt; awards system for potential employers but this will not be considered a</i><br>
<i>&gt; major factor by the school. That is to say, students will spend their time</i><br>
<i>&gt; worrying about their subjects rather than their examinations.</i><br>

learning directly from a book.</a>  With no structure, the place promptly went to
</a>
Hell &lt;pardon my language.  I lack a better cliche.&gt;  The school is now generally
considered the last step before reform school for troublemakers.

blow things up.  :p
