I liked the way it approached the thorny issue of defining identity.  
As I remember, the aliens mixed and matched memories and 
dispositions creating a variety of human personalities in order 
to study and understand something about humans that was 
apparently missing (or had been lost) in their species.  

<p>
I didn't particularly like the moral of the story, that there is some 
ineffable and unique quality to human nature that's missing in 
aliens and it's so desirable that they'll go to almost any lengths 
to get it for themselves.  What hubris!  The aliens were, in the 
<a name="0563qlink1">end, chastised for being so reductionistic.  Didn't they know that 
what makes us so special is not our identities but rather our 
human spirit?  Ack!

<p>
Hey Anders!  Is THAT a hollywood meme?

<p>
All that aside, I loved the look of the film and most of the plot.
