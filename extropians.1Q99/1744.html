<a href="1728.html#1744qlink1">&gt; Well, I don't know about this "informed discussion" business, but I can</a><br>
<i>&gt; tell you he's wrong.  Nothing in there explains "Why does anything exist</i><br>
<i>&gt; at all?"  I don't know where people got the idea this wasn't a</i><br>
<i>&gt; legitimate question of physics, but nobody will ever get the complete</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws written down, much less justified, without knowing the answer.</i><br>

<p>
I think 'incomplete' would be more accurate.  The ability to deduce most of
modern physics based on nothing but a knowledge of mathematics and
information theory may not be the ultimate answer, but it would be a huge
step forward.

<p>
<a href="1728.html#1744qlink2">&gt; Furthermore, this guy doesn't make any experimental predictions, and</a><br>
<i>&gt; from what I understood, I doubt he ever will..</i><br>

<p>
It looks to me like he's used his approach to derive at least one new law
already (that turbulent-flow equation), and more should follow.  You should
be able to test the approach by generating such equations for phenomena
where they do not currently exist, and then testing them.

<p>
IMHO this is pretty exiting stuff.  I hope we see more predictions, and some
experimental results, in the near future.
