Infinity is a tricky concept to handle.  We can visualize infinity mathematically,
<a name="3717qlink2">but there is no infinite quantity of anything or else it would</a> be everywhere.

<p>
<a name="3717qlink3">Infinity can be approximated by it's place in this equation:

<p>
lim 1/oo=0

<p>
The term "lim" means the limit approximation, "oo"</a> is the infinity symbol.

<p>
<a name="3717qlink4">Here is a reference to the CRC Concise Encyclopedia</a> of Mathematics about infinity:

<p>
<a name="3717qlink5"><a href="http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~eww6n/math/Infinity.html">http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~eww6n/math/Infinity.html</a>

<p>
This referenced page is talking about scalar infinity,</a> that is, infinity in terms
<a name="3717qlink6">of the rest of the numbers, and in one dimension.  There are multiple dimensions,
</a>
<a name="3717qlink7">so considering infinity in terms of multiple dimensions is exponentially more
</a>
<a name="3717qlink8">confusing.  I don't fully understand infinity in multiple or an infinite number of
</a>
dimensions.

<p>
I would disagree to some extent.  Things change, people change.  At a given time,
</a>
<a name="3717qlink15">we might consider a thing to be a particular thing, but at a different time, it is
</a>
different.


<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3717qlink16"><a href="3700.html#3703qlink2">&gt; The trouble comes in when we discuss all things (the universe). The question</a><br>
<a name="3717qlink17"><i>&gt; is "What isn't it?". Its fairly easy (in my view) to say that it *is*</i><br>
<i>&gt; everything. But to be is to be something and also to not be anything else. So,</i><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink18"><i>&gt; what isn't it?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
</a>

<p>
I would say that, among other things, it isn't the emotions and spiritual content
</a>
<a name="3717qlink19">of humanity, but a hard-core atheist might counter that those are simply complex
</a>
<a name="3717qlink20">biochemical reactions.

<p>
It is pretty much everything that would ever be considered, and those things which
</a>
<a name="3717qlink21">are not wholly of our universe take place in our universe, unless they don't, in
</a>
<a name="3717qlink22">which case they don't.  I realize this is a circular argument, but don't see a
</a>
<a name="3717qlink23">simpler way to explain my understanding of said situation.  Things beyond our
</a>
<a name="3717qlink24">"universe", in terms of energy or matter, are the subject of this thread.
</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3717qlink25"><a href="3700.html#3703qlink3">&gt; A conceptual distinction would be "It isn't what isn't", but that is just a</a><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink26"><i>&gt; boring tautology and doesn't help too much. But, if we try a little</i><br>
<i>&gt; rephrasing, you could say "It is everything" and switch it to "It isn't</i><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink27"><i>&gt; nothing." So, as I posted before, as nothing doesn't actually exist (nothing</i><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink28"><i>&gt; isn't a type of thing, it is "no-thing"), we can say that nothing exists</i><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink29"><i>&gt; outside the universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So, does this create an infinite universe? Again, I'm gonna go with no.</i><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink30"><i>&gt; Identity is finity.  That is to say, to be is to be limited. There are borders</i><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink31"><i>&gt; and ends and beginnings. And, as the universe is, it is limited.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
That is limiting.  We can empirically prove certain things, and, for example,
</a>
<a name="3717qlink32">reproduce most chemical reactions with accuracy.  That is on the real scale.
</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3717qlink33"><a href="3700.html#3703qlink4">&gt; Now, as a final bit of ignorance confession, I have about no mathematical</a><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink34"><i>&gt; knowledge and virtually no scientific learning (apart from books I read). So,</i><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink35"><i>&gt; just as Aristotle made sense to himself, but looks pretty silly next to</i><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink36"><i>&gt; empirical proof, I'm willing to accept a cunning and empirical refutation. Or</i><br>
</a>
<a name="3717qlink37"><i>&gt; any refutation, really, that works out.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks for reading,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; William</i><br>

<p>
I don't really offer a refutation because it's based upon point of view.  My point
</a>
<a name="3717qlink38">of view is that mathematical infinity exists and the Infinity reference page
</a>
<a name="3717qlink39">listed above has been updated since I posted the Identity Expression Statement,
</a>
<a name="3717qlink40">lim 1/oo=0, to sci.math.moderated on March 11, 1999.

<p>

<p>
The Identity Expression Statement is about mathematical identities and numerology,
</a>
<a name="3717qlink41">not personal identity, which makes us each individuals.
