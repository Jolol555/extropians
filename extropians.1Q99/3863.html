Why must we assess? The only reason I can think of is that the person who
wants the assessed "thing" has no ability to assess the assessed "thing"
themselves (where "thing" can be anything that can be assessed).

<p>
Learning should be learning from the love for and interest in doing the
thing. It shouldn't be any other reason.

<p>
His idea is perhaps that because they are young (not referring to the
physical body necessarily) and they have no sense of responsability - and
only a partially formed ability to think properly, they take wrong
decisions. They need a good guide.
