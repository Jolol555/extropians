<p>
Well, yes and no. Socialism is a political philosophy; insofar as political
positions embody ethical questions and solutions, you're correct about it
being an ethical/moral view.

<p>
"Capitalism" is somewhat ambiguous. Viewed as economic science
(catallactics, or market theory), it's (ideally) value-free. However, most
proponents of capitalism do include an ethical dimension in their
<a name="0782qlink1">arguments, i.e. it's not only what works, but what's right. Nevertheless,
market freedom can be, and often is, defended on purely practical grounds
apart from ethical considerations. The same doesn't seem true of socialism
(at least not any more).</a>

<p>
