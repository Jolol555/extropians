<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink1">&gt;....I agree.  However, you can generate a scenario where that would happen if</a><br>

<p>
you mix the right assumptions together.  What we need is:




<OL>
  <li>  automated engineering is very easy

  <li>  nanotech design is manageable

  <li>  computers are very fast


</OL>
<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink2">&gt;4) nanotech is very hard to actually implement for some reason</a><br>

<p>
We have 1) and  3), at least to some degree now.  At least progress has been
</a>
dramatic in recent years, but of course will increase exponentially more in
eht future.  Design tools that allow design of chips with 0.18-0.25  micron
features is massively complex, and by necessity highly automated.  Massive
computers are being used to make more powerful computers.  This is happening
now.  I just bought a P II with 7.5 million transistors.  The design
complexity is massive, geometric data, logic, simulations, electromagnetic
models.  
<br>
<a name="0396qlink2">2)  we are short on this one and 4) may be actually true.  So we are getting
close to the described scenario.</a> 



<p>
<a name="0396qlink3"><a href="0278.html#0289qlink3">&gt;That creates a situation where you have designs for very advanced devices</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink4">&gt;that no one can build.  </a><br>

<p>
At any stage of technololgy you can design beyony your production technology.
Leonardo drew tanks.  I am biased, I am a HW guy, design is SW, you have good
</a>
ideas, you can make something.  In fabrication,<a name="0396qlink4"> you are up against physics,
</a>
entropy, mother nature,  and her dog Murphy. 

<p>
<a name="0396qlink5"><i>&gt;The first group to get an assembler can use it to</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink5">&gt;implement those designs, giving them a huge instant jump in power.</a><br>

<p>
Ordinarily we would expect other groups to duplicate the feat and catch up,

<p>
but nanotech also lets you make faster computers.  So, the leading power

<p>
whips up a huge mob of supercomputers and sets them to work designing even

<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink6">&gt;better hardware.  Their computers will be on a faster improvement curve than</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink7">&gt;anyone else's, so no one can catch up until they hit the limits of what is</a><br>

</a>
<p>
<i>&gt;possible.</i><br>

<p>
This exact scenario took place in the world geopolitical/technological sphere
1940-1990.  The US dominated technology, computers, and with government
investment, technology was applied in the most advanced ways to military
hardware.



<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink8">&gt;Now, I don't think that could actually happen, but that's because I think</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink9">&gt;assumptions are contradictory.  You can't get computers fast enough to</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink10">&gt;design smart matter and utility fog unless you are already using less</a><br>

<p>
advanced nanotech to build them.  I also don't think you can design

<p>
computers more than a few generations in advance of the ones you already

<p>
<a href="0278.html#0289qlink11">&gt;have, for essentially the same reason.</a><br>

<p>
Yup, designing too far ahead is interesting but not useful.  A balance of
effort between design and fabrication is needed.
