<a name="3744qlink1">Several people have answered my first question with "yes", and an implicit
assumption in their reasoning is that before you know what your number is
you should reason as if the 100!-th digit of PI is uniformly distributed.
This assumption, along with the Self-Sampling Assumption is needed to
reach the above conclusion. But of course the 100!-th digit of PI has a
definite value and is not random. So how do we justify the use of the
uniform distribution here?</a> And in general when faced with a computational

there is a probability distribution on the answer and (2) how do we come
up with this distribution?
