In that case, yes, you're paranoid.<a name="1721qlink1">  First, who's "they"?  Who's "the
military"?  The officers?  The generals and admirals?  The privates? 
High-level bureaucrats in the DoD?  Second, "the military" is not a
political force in this country.  The Department of Defense has so
little clout, in a nation where budgets are determined by nothing else,
</a>
that the army is deteriorating.

<p>
This isn't a banana republic.  Nobody has to keep the military happy. 
They don't have any Senators in their pocket.  Nobody in the military
structure has any political clout; thus, the kind of people who are
looking for power become politicians, not generals.  The various
<a name="1721qlink2">elements in the military don't have a cohesive interest group strong
enough to have its own agenda.</a>

<a name="1721qlink3">"The military" hasn't "long sought" _anything_.  It simply isn't a power
bloc; it doesn't have the power, and it isn't a bloc.</a>
