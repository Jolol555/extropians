And you define God as "the laws that govern massively complex systems"?



<p>
That sounds similar to what others have called "natural law" and natural

order, and I think that an updated, more detailed description emerges as you

<p>
say, "as new developments are proved."



<p>
But some people have an idea of God as the Supreme Fascist described in The

Bible, so perhaps we ought to invent a new word (a more extropian word, if

<p>
you will) for this new paradigm of the deity.

Thanks JR, interesting idea.  I don't define God as the laws that govern
complex systems, nor do I believe he is the supreme fascist.  I also believe
<a name="2524qlink1">that such a supreme being doesn't want or need to be worshipped by us or
anyone else.  But I do believe that he is good and will bring us back in an
afterlife a la Frank Tipler (Massive "Holy" computers with data</a> retreived from
the light cone).

<p>
<a name="2524qlink2">I still call him God because this theology is also for non extropians.</a>

<p>
Great thinking,

Adrian
