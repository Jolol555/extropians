J.R. Molloy... whoever Adrian is just tell him what Voltaire would tell... this
world is full of superfluous, so lets get rid of them with the offer of eternal
<a name="2577qlink2">life from the supreme being, whatever its denomination.... or just</a> ignore them?

<i>&gt; &gt;the light cone).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sounds like a cagey kind of supreme being. Anyway, whatever created this</i><br>
<i>&gt; "supreme being" seems immensely more deserving of my attention than a paltry</i><br>
<i>&gt; deity that can't even provide evidence of its own existence (or even make</i><br>
<i>&gt; its name known -- some call it Allah, others call it Jehovah, etc.). The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Natural Laws that formed the universe, accordingly appear more interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; than a bank of holy AI dedicated to retrieving ego-laden protoplasmic</i><br>
<i>&gt; carbon-based molecules.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; As an aside, the so-called Western religions seem somewhat cheap, in that</i><br>
<i>&gt; they only supply one supreme being among them. Other religions supply</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousands of gods. In fact, I think someone mentioned on another list that</i><br>
<i>&gt; cataloguing all the gods mentioned by theists of all persuasions (worldwide)</i><br>
<i>&gt; yields a total of around 2,500 gods. But since you only believe in _one_</i><br>
<i>&gt; supreme being, that means that you and I share a disbelief in 2,499 gods. By</i><br>
<i>&gt; eliminating belief in that last remaining god, we'd have perfect agreement</i><br>
<i>&gt; between us, since we've just now established that we agree except for that</i><br>
<i>&gt; tiny percentage of theism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I still call him God because this theology is also for non extropians.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Well, if "God" exists for non-extropians as well as for extropians, it would</i><br>
<i>&gt; appear that no advantage accrues to connecting oneself with extropy, because</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Supreme Being (rather than self-determined responsibility) will decide</i><br>
<i>&gt; who has been naughty or nice. So, if the Supreme Being wants the Extropy</i><br>
<i>&gt; Institute to prosper, then nothing anyone can do will prevent it. And if the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Supreme Being wants the Extropy Institute to fail, nothing anyone can do</i><br>
<i>&gt; will save it. So, just pray to your Supreme Being, and let the less</i><br>
<i>&gt; spiritually enlightened extropians toil away at their nanotech and neural</i><br>
<i>&gt; networks, never knowing about the Supreme Being's grand plan. In addition,</i><br>
<i>&gt; if it doesn't matter whether extropians believe in this Supreme Being or</i><br>
<i>&gt; not -- "such a supreme being doesn't want or need to be worshipped by us or</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone else" -- then why mention the rascal at all?</i><br>
