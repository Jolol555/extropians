Hello,

<p>
<a name="3786qlink1">Academia is certainly losing some of its luster in light of freely available
<a name="3731qlink2">Internet educational resources.

<p>
Calculators should not be allowed in elementary and secondary</a> math classes.
<a name="3731qlink3">Paper, pencil, rulers, and compasses are allowed.

<p>
Baseball caps of improper size restrict blood flow to the brain,</a> and thus
<a name="3731qlink4">should not be allowed to be worn in class.

<p>
A proper nutritional regimen should be federally mandated in all</a> school lunch
<a name="3731qlink5">programs.  This might involve vitamin supplements.

<p>
Overprescription of mood-altering drugs to children</a> is the wrong approach for
<br>
<a name="3731qlink6">"attention deficit disorder", a more correct approach would</a> be giving students<br>
<a name="3731qlink7">something interesting.  Mood-altering medication should only</a> be prescribed for
<a name="3731qlink8">severely emotionally disturbed children.

<p>
Standardized tests, and testing in general, are important</a> and relatively
<a name="3731qlink9">unbiased measures of scholastic aptitude and ability.

<p>
Teachers should be well versed in their subjects.

<p>
The schools should get together and make a huge emporium of educational
resources for all.

<p>
I am not a "professional" educator, but I strive to be a good one.

<p>
Teaching methods used for gifted and talented accelerated</a> track learning should
<a name="3731qlink10">be applied to all students.

<p>
The primary goal of education should be the imbuement</a> of problem solving skills
<a name="3731qlink11">and the ability to learn and reason, rote memorization is important for
spelling and medicine, among other things.  Etymology should</a> be taught on all
levels.

<p>
<a name="3731qlink12">The fundamentals of learning and knowledge are an important</a> foundation for
success.

<p>
