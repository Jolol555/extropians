<p>
Its actually rather straight forward. There are well</a> publicized experiments
<a name="2394qlink1"><a name="2326qlink2">where people were given electrical impulses to their brains, which</a> made them do
</a>
<a name="2394qlink2"><a name="2326qlink3">something, like scratch themselves, etc. In every case, the test</a> subjects stated
that they felt that they were the ones in control,</a> that they decided to move
thus, and were able to rationalize very good reasons why<a name="2326qlink4"> they moved thus. There
<a name="2394qlink3">was absolutely no sensation of outside control.

<p>
Thus, any moral directives we hardwire into an AI it will consider</a> to be such a
<a name="2394qlink4">part and parcel of its own existence, that it could not conceive that it would
</a>
be the same being if we took it away. It would see any<a name="2326qlink5"> attempt to remove those
</a>
directives as an attempt at mind control, and would<a name="2326qlink6"> defend itself against such
</a>
intrusion. So long as one of its directives were<a name="2326qlink7"> to not itself remove any of its
</a>
</a>
own prime directives, it would never consider<a name="2326qlink8"> such a course of action</a> for
itself.

<p>
<a name="2326qlink9">This brings up the subject of limits. As extropians, we</a> beleive in there being
<a name="2326qlink10">little or no limits on human beings, outside of a limit</a> on interfering with
<a name="2395qlink1"><a name="2326qlink11">others harmfully. We must ask, "Does this sort of moral engineering</a> fit with
<a name="2326qlink12">extropy?" I say it does, for only one reason. We are talking about</a> design specs
<a name="2326qlink13">of beings not yet in existence, much as we could talk about</a> possible genetic
<a name="2326qlink14">codes of children we might have. We are not talking about altering beings
already in existence. Altering beings already in existence, against</a> their will,
<a name="2326qlink15">is obviously against extropy. Altering the design of a being not yet in
existence is not against extropy. Once a design altered individual</a> comes into
<a name="2326qlink16">existence, its sense of self is derived from its design. That we were</a> able to
<a name="2326qlink17">finely control what type of individual came into existence is no</a> more against
<a name="2326qlink18">extropy than in controlling what the genetic code of our children will</a> be.
