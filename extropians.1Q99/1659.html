<p>
One warning about this.  No one should ever use Microsoft Word to edit
HTML unless you restrict all your development to that single product.</a>
The problem with Word on projects, which I have personally seen, is that
Word doesn't really edit HTML.  It translates your HTML page to Word
format.  Then you edit the Word document.  Then it writes a brand new
page based on your Word document.  The resulting page looks like your
original, but the HTML source is totally rewritten and has no similarity
to how you originally coded it in HTML.

<p>
You will lose all formatting from your original HTML document.  The
methods you use to write HTML will be totally rewritten.  Indented
paragraphs can become seperate lines with nonbreaking spaces in the
front of each line.  It will stick font sizes and styles on everything,
even if you were just leaving it to the default font.  Proper forms
layouts can be rewritten with input button tags instead of submit
buttons.

<p>
The worst part, is if you use an HTML construct that is not recognized
by Microsoft, such as pure Java (not Microsoft Java), or JavaScript (not
Microsoft J++ script), or Netscape Extensions (not Microsoft
extensions), these will be broken or removed from your HTML because the
Microsoft programming doesn't understand them.

<p>
Another bad thing is that Microsoft products, and all other products for
that matter, like to stick a header in the top saying that the page was
made with their fine product.  If you use more than one product to edit
the page, each will each keep inserting their headers in front of the
competitions headers, until you get hundreds of alternating spam tags
built right into your HTML code!

<p>
<a name="1663qlink2">Anyway, the bottom line is that Word HTML building is only good if you
are only use Microsoft products.  You can't write your own HTML and then
use word on it.  You can't use Word and other HTML products.  My
favorite HTML editor is a flat text editor.</a>
