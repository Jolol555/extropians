Yes, this is the one exception which I did not mention, mainly because it is
a construct, although it is thought that gravity may actually be a
manifestation of the casimir effect in the natural  world. What good is the
Casimir Effect? Well, if you could somehow make a tunnel from point A to
point B through space,  then you would have a free, cheap, and easy way to
travel to the stars, as the tunnel walls would protect the space you travel
through, allowing FTL travel, while the EM energy behind your ship would
propell you through the tunnel to the halfway point, and the pressure coming
in from the other end would slow you down. Of course you could help it along
by stationing a high power laser at each end.

<p>
This is a hell of a cosmic tube, and I have no idea what sort of pressure
densities there will be at the midpoint...though a laser's output should
balance it. A bit like a huge pneumatic tube system.... now this is a job
for buckytubes....
