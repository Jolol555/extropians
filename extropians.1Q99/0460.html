INSTRUCTIONS FOR LIFE:


<OL>
<a name="0474qlink2">  <li>  Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.</a>
<a name="0474qlink3">  <li>  Memorize your favourite poem.</a>
  <li>  Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all
you         want.
  <li>  When you say, "I love you", mean it.
<a name="0474qlink4">  <li>  When you say, "I'm sorry", look the person in the eye.</a>
  <li>  Be engaged at least six months before you get married.
<a name="0474qlink5">  <li>  Believe in love at first sight.</a>
  <li>  Never laugh at anyone's dreams.
  <li>  Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the
only      way to live life completely.
  <li>  In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling.
  <li>  Don't judge people by their relatives.
  <li>  Talk slow, but think quick.
  <li>  When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile
and     ask, "Why do you want to know?".
<a name="0474qlink6">  <li>  Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.</a>
<a name="0474qlink7">  <li>  Call your mom.</a>
<a name="0474qlink8">  <li>  Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.</a>
<a name="0474qlink9">  <li>  When you lose, don't lose the lesson.</a>
<a name="0474qlink10">  <li>  Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for
others;         Responsibility for all your actions.</a>
  <li>  Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.
<a name="0474qlink11">  <li>  When you realize you've made a mistake, take immeiate steps
to         correct</a> it.
<a name="0474qlink12">  <li>  Smile when picking up the phone.  The caller will hear</a> it in
your       voice.
  <li>  Marry a man/woman you love to talk to.  As you get older, (if
you       get older) their conversational skills will be as important as
any      other.
  <li>  Spend some time alone.
  <li>  Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values.
  <li>  Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.
  <li>  Read more books and watch less TV.
  <li>  Live a good, honourable life.  Then when you get older (if you
get      older) and think back, you'll get to enjoy it a second time.
<a name="0474qlink13">  <li>  Trust in God but lock your car. (And learn Kung-Fu).</a>
  <li>  A loving atmosphere in your home is so important.  Do all you can
to     create a tranquil harmonious home.
  <li>  In disagreements with loved ones, deal with the current situation.
    Don't bring up the past.
  <li>  Read between the lines.
<a name="0474qlink14">  <li>  Share your knowledge.  It's a way to achieve immortality.</a>
  <li>  Be gently with the earth.
<a name="0474qlink15">  <li>  Pray. There's immeasurable power</a> in it.
<a name="0474qlink16">  <li>  Never interrupt when you are being flattered.</a>
  <li>  Mind your own business.
<a name="0474qlink17">  <li>  Don't trust a man/woman who doesn't close his eyes when you
kiss        him/her.</a>
<a name="0474qlink18">  <li>  Once a year, go someplace you've never been before.</a>
  <li>  If you make a lot of money, put it to use helping others while
you      are living.  That is wealth's greatest satisfaction.
  <li>  Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a stroke
of        luck.
<a name="0474qlink19">  <li>  Learn the rules then break some.</a>
  <li>  Remember that the best relationship is one where your love for
each     other is greater than your need for each other.
  <li>  Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.
<a name="0474qlink20">  <li>  Remember that your character is your destiny.</a>
  <li>  Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon.
  <li>  Never drprive someone of Hope... It might be all they have.
