<p>
  IAN: That's really mixing things up. By "human"
  you mean to say "sentient," and as such, animal
  rights folks think animals are sentient (not
  human), and indeed, like humans, they are. 
  So sentence is a shared feature of all 
  animals, including the human animal.

<p>
  The case for non-cruelty to nonhuman animals 
  is the case for noncruelty to sentient beings 
  (the set of all animals including humans). 

<p>
  The evidence indicates that those willing to 
  inflict cruelty on nonhuman animals are more
  inclined to inflict the same on human beings.
  So seeing the fact of similarities between
  animals isn't the problem (as you suggest) 
  but it's the acceptance of cruelty that is.
