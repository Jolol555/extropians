We do get carried away at times.  I recommend discipline in
staying somewhat on topic.  (I recognize that I am one of hte
offenders...  sorry.)  {8-[   I am on some other lists, and they
are all more strict about straying off topic than extropians.
I guess its because with extropians it is  more difficult to define
interests, which span broadly indeed.  Let us be quick to take a
topic offline with those who are interested, such as the perennial
gun virus and the plane crash thing.  {8^D  spike
