Mike, you've set off my bogometer.  This guess of yours makes absolutely
no sense.  I live down in Florida, and I am not aware of any protestors
visiting the reefs.  Protestors like to stay topside with people they
can protest towards.  We have thousands of tourist divers every year.
Why do you blame the protestors as being the carriers of human virii?
</a>

<p>
The fact of the matter is, the problem with the coral reefs is well
known to be treated sewage, which still contains human virii, making its
way out to sea.  Tons of nutrient-rich, bacteria-filled and virii-rich
effluent are produced every month.  There is no reason to assume that
any human directly carries these virii to the coral reef.

<p>
Your explanation is purely politically motivated, and has no basis in
fact.  You like to turn the tables on those pesky liberals, and show how
they are to blame for the very problems they are protesting.  The idea
of representing your political opponents as disease carriers is a very
old trick, but I don't like to see it on this list.
