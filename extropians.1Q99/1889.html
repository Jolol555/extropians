There have been several actually Top Secret U.S. Military
attacks/wargames called Operation Last Dance using live fire 
on several communities in Texas, even blowing up a building 
or two! This is real! Local officials are sworn to secrecy. 
Citizens are terrorized and mad as hell, while the major
media keeps a blackout. Read about this fascist outrage:

<a name="1896qlink1">A local FEMA official has said that the Operation-Last-Dance 
attacks on Texas are part of training for massive gun-roundup 
operations. The FEMA official said that this was the official 
wargame scenario of the special forces attack on Kingsville:

<p>
   "Martial law has been declared through
   presidential powers and war powers act, and
   some citizens have refused to give up their
   weapons. They have taken over two of the
   buildings in Kingsville. The police cannot
   handle it. So you call these guys in. They
   show up and they zap everybody, take all the
   weapons, and let the local P.D. clean it up,"
</a>

<p>
Mass roundups of privately-owned firearms are a hallmark 
of totalitarian takeovers (visit:  <a href="http://www.jpfo.org">http://www.jpfo.org</a> ). 
I get the feeling this nation is in for some changes, the 
early warning signs, such as talk of "black helicopters," 
having been effectively suppressed as signs of insanity.
Gun control planners will achieve the final objective 
of reducing the American people to defenseless sheep 
at the mercy of their terrorizing military masters.

             ARMED AND DANGEROUS 
             Fear and loathing 
             in Kingsville, Texas 
             Local residents fuming 
             over Army live-fire exercise 


             By David M. Bresnahan
             (c) 1999 WorldNetDaily.com 

             A group of Kingsville, Texas, citizens now
             plan to pursue action against their city for
             permitting the Army to use live ammunition
             during an exercise in their town known as
             Operation Last Dance. 

             Angry citizens are expected to crowd the next
             city council and county commission
             meetings, both scheduled to be held Feb. 22.
             At least one citizen is looking into legal
             action. 

                           Some residents said they
                           were terrified when
                           helicopters swooped into
                           town from the Army
                           Special Operations
                           Command, Ft. Bragg,
                           North Carolina, last
                           Monday night. One
                           helicopter hit a telephone
                           pole, which started a fire
             and horrified residents who saw it happen. 

             At least eight helicopters are reported to have
             participated in an assault exercise using live
             ammunition and explosives very close to
             innocent bystanders who were not warned of
             the planned action. 

             Fire officials confirmed that they responded
             to the resulting fire, but had no warning that
             the exercise would take place. They were also
             summoned to put out a building fire caused
             by explosions set off during the exercise. 

             It has since been learned from military
             sources that the actual group involved in the
             exercise is known as the Knight Stalkers, an
             elite group from the Delta Force. They are
             trained to conduct assassination missions,
             according to several retired military officers
             who had served in various special operations
             assignments. 

             The Army Special Operations Command at
             Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, has acknowledged
             that the event was the kick-off of a series of
             similar training operations going on in
             Kingsville, Corpus Christi and Fort Sam
             Houston, but would not confirm that the
             group was the Knight Stalkers. Additional
             training events have been confirmed in the
             area. 

             Austin radio station talk show host Alex
             Jones went to Kingsville to investigate for
             WorldNetDaily. He arrived just in time to find
             work crews covering up the evidence of the
             extensive damage caused by the exercise. 

             A former police station and an old Exxon
             office building were nearly destroyed.
             Evidence of bullet holes in walls, explosions
             from grenades, and other explosive charges
             could be seen. Fire damage was also
             extensive in at least one of the buildings. 

<br>
             "There was a joint<br>
             training session between
             the United States Army
             and the Kingsville Police
             Department," Lt. Judy
             Hayes, third in command
             at the Kingsville police
             told Jones. 

<br>
             "The Army was doing<br>
             some sort of extraction
             type thing. They used
             eight helicopters. Our
             training involved sealing off the area, as if we
             were involved in taking care of a hazardous
             materials type incident. We were rerouting
             traffic and making sure there was no civilian
             foot traffic in the area. So we got quite a bit
             of training in that area. 

<br>
             "The only participation on the part of the<br>
             Kingsville Police Department was in a
             hazardous materials training session. We did
             not participate in any way with what the Army
             was doing," insisted Hayes. 

             Throughout the interview with Jones, two
             men in black SWAT team uniforms stood
             behind her. Jones believes it was an attempt
             to intimidate him. 

             The Kingsville Fire Department was not given
             notice of the exercise, and it was not invited
             to participate in the alleged hazardous
             materials training, even though it would be
             called in if there were a real even of that kind. 

             The fire department spokesman claimed
             officials were not aware of the event until they
             were called to respond to the telephone pole
             fire and the fire at the former police station. 

             An elderly lady who lives in an apartment
             across from where the exercise took place
             told Jones that she was frightened to death
             and crying. She was sitting on a bench in full
             view of the area where the helicopters first
             appeared and where all the shooting took
             place. 

<br>
             "I sit on the bench, and then I get scared<br>
             because the noise. It was so terrible and too
             loud, you know. They were throwing some
             bombs. I think they were using some rifles
             too, and the other kind of rifles that go pop,
             pop, pop, pop, pop, you know," said the
             elderly woman, identified only as Gracie. 

             She described seeing many black helicopters
             with men in black coming out of them. She
             heard explosions and apparently machine gun
             fire. She said it lasted at least two hours. 

<br>
             "I was so scared I went back to my<br>
             apartment, but I could still hear the noise,"
             Gracie said. She said she was so scared that
             she cried and her heart hurt. She said no one
             warned her or came to tell her what was going
             on. 

             Business owners are also complaining. The
             police claim they warned businesses in the
             area of the exercise in advance. If they did,
             WorldNetDaily was unable to find any that
             would confirm that. The businesses in the
             area that were open at the time of the exercise
             had no idea what was going on. 

             A former police chief and former city council
             member have expressed dismay over the
             incident and are contemplating filing an
             official complaint. 

                           Police Chief Philipe
                           Garza has been the
                           object of a number of
                           investigations lately.
                           Currently the U.S.
                           Department of Justice
                           has been asked to
                           investigate accusations of
                           police abuse. Several
                           residents, who did not
                           wish to be identified,
                           claim that Garza is very
                           abusive with citizens and
                           rules by intimidation. 

                           Garza claims there are
                           very few complaints from
                           residents of Kingsville.
                           He says the only
             complaints are coming from people in other
             parts of the country. 

             The head of emergency management for
             Kingsville is the Federal Emergency
             Management Agency coordinator Tomas
             Sanchez. He is a highly decorated Navy
             veteran, wounded in Vietnam and retired after
             30 years of service. He now continues to
             serve as the head of the military police unit of
             the Texas State Guard, which is under the
             National Guard. 

             Sanchez has had extensive experience and
             training in special operations, and he
             expressed deep concern to WorldNetDaily
             about events in Kingsville. He was asked
             what was the purpose of the exercise. He said
             the plan involved a scenario that required
             military action because local police could not
             deal with civilians effectively. 

<br>
             "Martial law has been declared through<br>
             presidential powers and war powers act, and
             some citizens have refused to give up their
             weapons. They have taken over two of the
             buildings in Kingsville. The police cannot
             handle it. So you call these guys in. They
             show up and they zap everybody, take all the
             weapons, and let the local P.D. clean it up,"
             described Sanchez of the scenario the Knight
             Stalkers were likely given. 

             Sanchez says the military exercise in his town
             was illegal under the Posse Comitatus Act,
             but he says that Presidential Decision
             Directive 25 has given an exception to Special
             Operations. He believes the men involved
             have total immunity from any legal action
             against them. Although PDD 25 is top secret,
             Sanchez has seen it because of his position
             with FEMA, and he has a security clearance.
             He would not provide a copy to
             WorldNetDaily. 

<br>
             "Some folks are talking about seeking some<br>
             legal counsel. Some are asking for the crisis
             incident stress management counseling. They
             would like to see some of that," said
             Sanchez. 

<br>
             "When the helos are right<br>
             above the rooftop, and
             the windows are vibrating,
             and people are ducking
             under the bed, and so on
             and so forth, they need
             that," he explained. 

             Sanchez was able to
             locate some of the
             helicopters and some of
             the soldiers used in
             Operation Last Dance. He decided to take a
             drive to the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station
             and the Corpus Christi Army Depot where all
             the helicopters are given maintenance. 

<br>
             "Parked between hanger 45 and 46 on the<br>
             tarmac were four Blackhawk, no marking,
             helicopters. They've got it all blocked off
             with a chain link fence that says ID card
             required to gain access. No security guard.
             One can drive up close enough to look
             through the fence and see the Blackhawk
             helocopters. Only four of them were parked
             there," said Sanchez of his findings. 

             He said the men involved are most likely
             staying at the bachelor- enlisted quarters,
             which is a three-story barracks building.
             Some of the men have been observed eating
             in a fast food restaurant right near the
             bachelor-enlisted quarters. 

<br>
             "You can always tell these guys because even<br>
             when they put on civilian clothes they still
             look like Army Rangers. White sidewalls we
             call it. Short crew cut," Sanchez explained.
