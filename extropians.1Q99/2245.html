<a name="2256qlink1">It would be useful to know the mechanism by which light is "slowed down" when traveling through a medium.  It's been some years since I've studied this stuff and I seem dimly to recall that the light is absorbed and retransmitted by the atoms of the medium, thus causing the delay.  I suspect the accuracy of this recollection, as well as the accuracy of the original "factoid".  But it leaves me wondering as to the actual mechanism.  
<pre>
	The photon or wavefront is passing through a three dimensional array of atoms, consisting mostly of empty space--the central nucleus, and the surrounding electron particle/wave-ness--and the passing light interacts somehow with the resident matter such that the light emerges unaffected save for a delay.  Howzat?</a>
	With the Bose-Einstein condensate the delay is so long that, if absorbtion/reemission is the mechanism, then it seems like the photon would get sucked up and then held onto for a goodly piece, and then spit out again without any evidence of its sequestration.  I don't know.  Time to send this theory back in for an upgrade.
<a name="2285qlink1">	I've been reading about quantum stuff lately: EPR, Bell, Aspect,</a> nonlocality, etc.  But the more I read the more confused I get.  It's supposed to be the other way round.  But that's the nature of QM, it turns logic on its head.   Hmmmmm.
