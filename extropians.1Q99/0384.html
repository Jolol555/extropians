<a name="0407qlink3">Because much of mankind shares similar wants/likes at basic levels (no
organism likes being attacked, we all understand that being reasonable
towards people increases the chance that they will be reasonable</a> towards us,
<a name="0407qlink4">we like people to behave in trustworthy ways, etc.).</a>

<p>
I felt the same way for a while.  But then I also felt teh same way when I
realised that money was just bits of paper that people had agreed to
exchange for things people can actually use.  When nothing nasty happens and
<a name="0407qlink6">people continue acting in a reasonable way, the feeling goes away.
