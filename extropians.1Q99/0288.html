There is no certainty that a purely capitalistic economy would
have enriched Einstein.  Perhaps he would have found it easier
to make lots of money.  Producing "good stuff" isn't enough --
you have to get other people to pay you for your stuff.
Discoveries in theoretical physics are pretty hard to leverage
into a really large fortune.</a></a>

<p>
Because there are many seemingly objective facts about our
environment, including the fact that most of us hold
similar, though subjective, opinions about what is right
and wrong.</a>
