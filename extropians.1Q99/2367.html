itself also had

<a href="2216.html#2367qlink2">&gt;passengers, as well as the cockpit, where some of the black boxes are,</a><br>
which would have

<p>
<a name="2388qlink1">  IAN: You've already been corrected on that one 
  at least twice and yet you continue to make that 
  false claim. It wasn't the nose section that the 
  video says hits 29 seconds after the 17,000 climb,
  but the main fuselage section that did the climb. 

<p>
  Since you "explained" the way-too-fast fall with 
  an argument based on a falsehood, I guess you've
  run out of arguments for the CIA video. Please 
  try to both listen and watch the video this 
  time: <a href="http://www.newsday.com/jet/year/video.</a>htm">http://www.newsday.com/jet/year/video.htm</a>

<a href="2216.html#2367qlink4">&gt;&gt; Mike, this troubles me.  With hydrocarbon fuels, it requires a lot more</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; air than fuel to make an ignition.  Too rich and it wont even burn,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; never</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; mind explode.  Having a fuel tank leak would cause some air to be vented</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; in, I just dont see how you could get the magic 15 to 1 air to fuel</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; ratio</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; inside a fuel tank.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The 15 to 1 air to fuel ratio is not magic. It is a ratio which requires a</i><br>
high minimum air
<br>
<a href="2216.html#2367qlink5">&gt;pressure level to ignite. At atmospheric pressure, a higher ratio will</a><br>
easily ignite. Now,
<br>
<a href="2216.html#2367qlink6">&gt;here's another idea: vacuum pressure. The plane was ascending thru the mid</a><br>
teen levels. The
<br>
<a href="2216.html#2367qlink7">&gt;tanks had been sealed at sea level and are partially pressurized. There is</a><br>
obviously going
<br>
<a href="2216.html#2367qlink8">&gt;to be enough pressure to encourage outflow from any even minor leaks in</a><br>
the tank. Put that
<br>
<a href="2216.html#2367qlink9">&gt;outflow near some sparking kapton wire, and BOOM. Moreover, since the tank</a><br>
was mostly empty,
<br>
<a href="2216.html#2367qlink10">&gt;its volume was not entirely a vapor version of the fuel. It was air filled</a><br>
with fuel fumes.
<br>
<a href="2216.html#2367qlink11">&gt;It is an ideally explosive setup. Ideal mixing, minimum swirl, etc.</a><br>


<p>
<a name="2388qlink2">  IAN: Mike, jet fuel is not explosive at temps
  below (I believe around) 165 degrees. Commander
<a name="2374qlink1">  Donaldson has shown that you can put out a 
</a>
  cigarette in Jet A-1 fuel.
