<a href="3254.html#3284qlink1">&gt;&gt; I do not believe that a particular position on abortion, for or against,</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; should be part of the Extropian political principles.  When does a cell</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; mass stop being an embryo and start being a sentient being?  This is a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; question of neurology and nothing else.</i><br>

<p>
If that is the reason, then the extropian position should be "abortion of
non-sentient life is OK" Neurology can then define the impact, but extropy
has a stance.

<p>
In fact, the real reason for no policy is that, as stated clearly in this
forum, extropy is a pragmatic philosophy with no fixed moral platform.

<p>
I am seeking to develop an alternative, but, as yet, will confess to having
not succeeded.

"The ostensible grounds of many dismissals are not the same as the real
reasons. I think that the only proper defence of academic freedom is tenure
itself."

<p>
Earl Russell [son of Bertrand Russell], 1988, in a maiden speech opposing
the Education Reform Bill which was to deprive British academics of tenure
and to allow them to be dismissed without warning merely for "good cause"-
just like any other British employees. Hansard, House of Lords 496, iii/iv,
p. 1385f.
