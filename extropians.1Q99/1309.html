<a name="1321qlink1">It seems to me that this law merely puts restrictions on the way testing
is done.  It does not explicitly authorize human testing, but it says
that IF human testing is done, it must be done in certain ways.  It says
that the testing must involve certain kinds of notifications and certain
time limits.</a>

<p>
<a name="1321qlink2">Repealing the law would therefore repeal the restrictions.  There would
no longer be the requirement of notice within 30 days, or notice to
civilian authorities.

<p>
It's not clear to me that the repeal of this law would make it illegal
to test chemical or biological agents on humans.  There may be other
laws which would do that, but the mere act of repealing this would would
not in itself make such testing illegal.</a>
