Joe,

<p>
<a name="2869qlink1">   Yes, but would it be something you would allow to be imposed on you if you
were found guilty, or would you try to circumvent this punishment?  Since you
would essentially be free (except for the implant) you could try to have it
removed (quite illegal, but that's never stopped people before).  How would
you safeguard against that?  Also, for what type of crimes would you recommend
this sentence?  Lastly, how long do you think it would take to make this
punishment available if we decided to do it?  Thanks for your input, Joe.
