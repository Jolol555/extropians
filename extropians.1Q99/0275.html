What I, and perhaps some of the other posters, object to is not that
Einstein was partly a prisoner of the memes of his time (we all are), but
that he attempted to affect society by pontificating on a subject that, as
you say, "...he did not even practice". I suspect Einstein would have
savaged a physics paper written by someone as ill-informed about that
subject as he apparently was about economics, and rightly so. Einstein's
brilliance as a physicist does not give his opinions in other areas any
special currency.
