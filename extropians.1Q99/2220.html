<a name="2221qlink1">Interestingly enough, the next release of Pentiums III, 800MHZ,
will put them into a supercomputer category and so will trigger
corresponding export restrictions. - See story at

<p>

<p>
What will the government do now?
<br>
The answer should be simple:  whatever it was planning to
do when this happens.  The export restrictions aren't new, neither
is Moore's "Law", so this event was predictable, _long_ time ago.
But no, the law is static, and now there are again expensive
lobbying efforts for raising the definition of the supercomputer
(once?), etc.

<p>
<a name="2224qlink1">Why is that that the regulatory bodies are so delusional they
assume we live in a static world - where their very purpose
should be formulated now as assurance of smooth growth
of the society they should understand well enough to govern?

<p>
Are they too stupid to extrapolate apparent trends, or there is
something else in the system that makes it ignore them?</a></a>
