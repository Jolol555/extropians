<p>
I have, and I don't see that at all.  Besides that, the ExI statements doesn't
exclude negative states, just defeatist ones.  Fear, panic, concern, worry,
etc., aren't on the list.  Those mental states certainly have their place.

<p>
Potential solutions should dominate our thinking, as well as potential
opportunities.

<p>
My enthusiasm certainly enhances my intelligence.  I'm amazingly more
productive when enthused.

<p>

<i>&gt; deliberate misuse.</i><br>

<p>
Well, similar issues provided the context for a previous discussion on the
term "dynamic optimism".  Several people, including me, thought that the
term implied the kind of brain-dead optimism you see in some pep talks and
sales seminars.  But none of us thought that's what ExI was suggesting;
there's nothing in the ExI statement about "refusing to acknowledge dangers"
or other various difficulties.  Max has addressed those objections (nicely,
IMO)
<br>
with the shift to "practical optimism".  Ignoring realities, including
dangers,
<br>
is anything but "practical" but the emphasis is on how to improve things.

<p>
<a href="0880.html#0890qlink7">&gt; Someone has to keep track of the threats.</a><br>
