<p>
One should note that this is only true over short time scales.  A generation
that grows up with affluence level X will consider it the minimum they can
live on, and try to achieve something substantially better.  Also, a large
fraction of society is not satisfied with anything less than the mansion -
there is a wide diversity of opinion over when enough is enough.

<i>&gt; educated and brought into the New Class.</i><br>

<p>
This description may fit teachers and scientists.  It does not fit knowledge
workers at all.  Most of us don't stop worrying about money until we can
afford lots of our favorite techno-toys, which means upper-middle class at
least.

<p>
Also, it is a mistake to think that the workers can all become part of this
class.  Most people don't especially enjoy anything you could reasonably
expect to be paid for - they want to go fishing, hunt deer, watch the game,
party, read a book, attend a play, etc.  If they can support these
activities without having to work, most of them will.

<p>
<a href="0782.html#0859qlink12">&gt; So.  On practical grounds, private ownership and production</a><br>
<i>&gt; are a success, and vital to any society, and urgent for any poor one.  On</i><br>
<i>&gt; practical grounds, a wealthy society does not need to be growing at the</i><br>
<i>&gt; fastest possible rate, which is why its members will be buying insurance</i><br>
<i>&gt; and engaged in other members, not all market friendly, to protect their</i><br>
<i>&gt; elemental affluence.  A wealthy society can afford to sacrifice 1% of GDP</i><br>
<i>&gt; growth and buy basic social insurance for all of its members, and to</i><br>
ensure
<br>
<i>&gt; that all have access to basic</i><br>
<a href="0782.html#0859qlink13">&gt; food and medicine, and above all to a good education.  This will make</a><br>
<i>&gt; people happier; most feel more secure from want, and the rich</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't have to imprison themselves as they're doing right now in Brazil.</i><br>

<p>
Isn't Brazil a good argument for rapid growth?  Their problem isn't large
income disparities, its that there are too many people who can't afford
food.

<p>
In more general terms, this analysis ignores the fact that the benefits of
growth do not end when you have a warm bed and a full belly.  Wealth can be
spent to buy health, and the more wealthy you are the more health you can
get.  No nation on Earth is wealthy enough to provide<a name="0970qlink5"> top-notch medical care
</a>
to everyone, and the best way to solve this problem is to grow as fast as
possible.  Growth won't remove the inequality, but it will make everyone
better off than they were.

<p>
Also, the 1% idea is completely divorced from reality.  Most people don't
want to work, for the very simple reason that they have other things they
would rather do.  If you make it possible for them to do the things they
really want to do without having to work, many of them won't.  You end up
having to support a significant fraction of the population, which costs much
more than 1% (try 20% for starters, and it will grow with time).  All of
this is just for the basic living standard - throw in medical care and the
potential cost instantly becomes larger than your GDP.

<p>
To make these ideas work, you need a world in which all basic human needs
can be met without significant human labor - and if we could do that, we
wouldn't need welfare programs in the first place.  We may see such a world
after nanotech and advanced AI arrive, but we aren't there yet.

<p>
<a href="0782.html#0859qlink14">&gt; He also points out that a moderately managed society might be more</a><br>
productive
<br>
<a href="0782.html#0859qlink15">&gt; than a laissez faire one, in that it would avoid the very severe</a><br>
productivity
<br>
<a href="0782.html#0859qlink16">&gt; loss caused by the deep recessions such as America had frequently in the</a><br>
19th
<br>
<a href="0782.html#0859qlink17">&gt; century.  Lots of people unemployed equals lots of people not producing.</a><br>

<p>
Why should we expect future economists to be any better at it than those of
the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries?  There has never been a time when
government simply left the market alone.  The governments of the 19th and
20th centuries have tried every scheme they could think of to prevent
recessions and boost economic growth.  At this point it is clear that such
approaches don't work.  We don't know nearly enough about economies to be
able to fine-tune their operation by government fiat.

<p>
America tried 'moderately managed' society in the 19th century, and 'heavily
regulated' society in the 20th.  Other countries have experimented with
'totally regulated' society in various guises.  I can think of no instance
in which anyone has actually tried laissez faire - usually they just make
speeches about it while enacting more regulations.
