  IAN: I see what you're saying, and I think the point
  is that it doesn't say it must or will happen, but 
  that it may happen. As it says, once the 30-day 
  waiting period is over, "such test or experiment 
  may then be conducted." The 30-day notice probably 
  allows key local-civilian officials to plan a vacation.

  We don't even know, at least I don't know (many
  claim to know), if they ever utilized the system
  defined. They may have been "spraying" rural cities
  every day or no days, but many people claim such.
  I've read claims of spraying years ago, it sounded 
  like crazy talk, but now I find it defined in law!</a>

  It seems like a classified code that popped its head out
  like the Loch Ness monster, only to slip back underwater.
  It's like a "sighting," and once deleted, few will believe.

<a href="1309.html#1321qlink2">&gt;Repealing the law would therefore repeal the restrictions.  There would</a><br>

<p>
  IAN: Ya... good thinking! If so, the repeal acts 
  as a distraction, causing the illusion of an end.

<p>
  I can't say that during the 20 years that law was 
  the law of my country that I ever heard about it
  in the major media or in any social commentary.
  I wonder if it was ever discussed in the media.
  I hope there's a "repealed U.S. Code archive."
