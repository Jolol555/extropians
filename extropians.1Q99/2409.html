<i>&gt;I haven't had a chance to go back over the video yet, as I've been moving my</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer equipment (now you'll accuse me of being in a conspiracy).</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: You made a false statement several times,
  which I've corrected. Apparently it's useful to 
  you to try to twist that into my being paranoid.


<p>
<a href="2388.html#2409qlink2">&gt;Commander Donaldson may be a fine pilot. He is not skilled at all as a jet</a><br>
<i>&gt;mechanic. I am.</i><br>

<p>
  IAN: Oh? Donaldson was the maintenance officer 
  of a Navy jet squadron and a graduate of crash
  analysis training from the Naval Post Graduate 
  School. His first crash investigation was of
  an accidental shoot down of a Navy A4 in 1977
  (<a href="http://members.aol.com/bardonia/cdrindex.htm">http://members.aol.com/bardonia/cdrindex.htm</a>).

<a name="2526qlink2"><a href="2388.html#2409qlink3">&gt;&gt;   IAN: Mike, jet fuel is not explosive at temps</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   below (I believe around) 165 degrees. Commander</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   Donaldson has shown that you can put out a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;   cigarette in Jet A-1 fuel.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is no such thing as Jet A-1 fuel. There is A-1, A-2 and A-3 fuel,</i><br>
all are
<br>
<a href="2388.html#2409qlink4">&gt;aviation rated. Jet fuels are J-1 thru J-6. Please get your nomenclature</a><br>
<i>&gt;straight. It is true you can drop a lit cigarette in any J class fuel AT ROOM</i><br>
<i>&gt;TEMPERATURE without triggering ignition. </i><br>

<p>
  IAN: Even above room temperature. 
</a>


<p>
<a name="2526qlink3"><a href="2388.html#2409qlink5">&gt;However, an electrical arc is much</a><br>
<i>&gt;higher temperature than a cigarette, as it is a plasma, especially an</i><br>
<i>&gt;electrical arc triggering an explosion of kapton insulation, which would not</i><br>
<i>&gt;only add high temperature, but high compression from the small blast shock</i><br>
wave
<br>
<a href="2388.html#2409qlink6">&gt;to provide conditions similar to that inside the combustion chamber of a jet</a><br>
<i>&gt;engine. Not to mention the fact that I have all along been talking about jet</i><br>
<i>&gt;fuel FUMES, which are highly flammable at even room temperature, given the</i><br>
<i>&gt;proper ignition. There is a significant difference between liquid fuel and</i><br>
<i>&gt;fumes, which you can't seem to grasp. </i><br>

<p>
  IAN: You just spoke of drops of the fuel 
  leaking out and being ignited, not fumes. 
  Donaldson does a lot of tests with jet 
  fuel, where he attempt to explode the 
  fuel and the fumes, and gets little 
<br>
  in the way of impressive results.
<br>
  He has these tests on video tape.
