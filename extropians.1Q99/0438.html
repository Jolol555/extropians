<a name="0455qlink1"><a name="0452qlink1">Here is a consequentialist argument for eating animals: cows lives are 
overall worth living, even if they are slaughtered at the end.  What happens
if you convince the world that you from now on you will no longer eat cows,
and instead spend the same amount on fancy vegetable foods?  The demand for
cows goes down and the demand for veggies goes up.  Farmers will choose to
grow fewer cows to meet that demand, and will choose to plant more fancy
veggie crops.  People who used to have jobs processing cow meat will switch
to jobs processing veggies.  And so</a> on.

<a name="0501qlink1"><a name="0446qlink1">So unless you do something else in switching from meat to veggies, like 
donating money to charities that raise cows which are never killed, the 
direct effect of switching is to reduce the number of cows who ever live.</a>
<a name="0455qlink2">In order to eliminate that bad end-of-cow-life experience, you elimate
the entire cow life experience.  If that whole cow life is "worth living"
in some sense, this wasn't necessarily a kind thing to do.  (Unless you 
think those veggie lives are more worth living, even though they get 
killed in the end.)</a>
