Gotta have me one of them T-shirts!  Let me know when I can get my grubby
hands on one.

<p>
Here's another promotional idea.

<p>
<a name="3112qlink1">I was glancing at a calendar today . . . 365 sheets, each with a pretty
picture of children doing cute things and a semi-thoughtful quote, and I
started thinking how nice it would be to see a calendar spreading Extropian
memes via Extropian-related quotes linked with Extropian art.  If we don't
have enough art for 365 days, do we have enough for 52 weeks?  I bet we
could come up with 52 good quotes that best represent Extropian principles.
I would ask Natasha to consider overseeing how the art might be linked to
the quotes once they were gathered.  Perhaps the final product could be in
the form of a screensaver and offered through CNET and other screensaver
sites?  Or actually marketed through bookstores for a profit.</a>

<p>
<a name="3112qlink2">Your thoughts?
