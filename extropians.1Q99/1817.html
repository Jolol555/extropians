hi all and Paul,

<p>
I wrote 
<br>
<a href="1814.html#1817qlink1">&gt;&gt; Unless you have evidence that time is something other than</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the motion of matter, you must accept that just as it cannot be</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; destroyed, it cannot be created.</i><br>

<p>
and Paul said
<br>
<a name="1818qlink1"><a href="1816.html#1817qlink2">&gt;To accept any limit simply because we don't know of a way around</a> it, entirely</a><br>
<a name="1818qlink2"><i>&gt;circumvents the tranhumanist spirit of inquiry and exploration.</i><br>

<p>
I am sensitive to some elements of the spirit behind this claim. But I 
disagree with it. It is simply not up to us what limits there are. They 
either are or are not. And that was really my point.

<p>
What i responded to in Eric's initial mail was the idea that not only is 
everything we "know" wrong (I am confident that it is), but that it could 
be wrong in a way which invalidated all of our efforts to understand the 
</a>universe. 

<p>
<a name="1818qlink3">That it could be wrong in a Cartesian fashion: with the whole universe in 
fact put into play by a creator who has left no trace of himself. 
Accepting this, to me, makes a mockery of being human. Frankly, if for 
one moment I conceived that this was possible, I would exercise the only 
free choice left to me: I would excuse myself from this joke</a> at my 
expense.

<p>
cheerio chaps,
<br>
tim
