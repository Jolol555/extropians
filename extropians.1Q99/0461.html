<p>
  IAN: One is neither kind nor cruel to 
  a creature one never creates. I'd say 
  there's no being that is never born, 
<br>
  thus none are deprived life when 
<br>
  less births than normal occur.

<p>
  IAN: Right, but I think it puts the 
<br>
  cart before the horse to say that a 
<br>
  non-birth is not nice to a being we 
<br>
  imagine might have existed if born.

<i>&gt;&gt;  If so, then causing people to be born just to </i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If a certain group of humans were created for food, I suspect</i><br>

<p>
  IAN: I think one of the main measures 
  for rights is difference: we're less 
<br>
  able to feel for things that are
<br>
  different. Bugs are really different
<br>
  than us, and the idea of "bug rights"
<br>
  isn't too much spoken for. Blacks are
<br>
  different than whites, and so historically 
  whites have given them less-to-no rights.

<p>
  This is why I think that those that extend
  rights to animals perceive a similarity;
  they perceive that this other entity sees 
  and feels like I do, and a spark of "self"
  is therefore seen in the other being, and
  with that perception comes a compassion.
