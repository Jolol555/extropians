I sense a fear of totalitarian systems.... I live in one until i was 36 years
old and i survived....
<br>
And i am not a sub-genius, just a normal human with the genes i was born
with...
<br>
There are stupid people and stupid people... the ones that cannot recognize a
coercive tactic and the others... but the ones that cannot recognize a
coercive tactic don't read about transhumanism....
The pope, the cardinals, the bishops and all  the lower staff of the religions
of this world can recognize a coercive tactic but are not gonna let themselves
be transhumans by force... they tried to 'transcend', people Torquemada way,
not my way.... As you can see there are several levels of stupidity and as
Einstein would say 'There are only two things infinite - the universe and
human stupidity'.
<br>
Keep smiling...
