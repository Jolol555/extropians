<a href="1925.html#1988qlink1">&gt; I wonder if A.A.Attanasio has even been discussed in Extropian circles. I</a><br>

<p>
Hmm, interesting. I've avoided Attanasio so far because I was under the
impression that he(?) wrote simply fantasy pretending to be far-future
novels, and I'm not big on non-technical speculative fiction. (Yes, it's
kind of silly to judge an author before reading him, but OTOH you
somehow need to make a choice on what to read.) I think I'll now give
him a try.

<p>
&gt; In the original Extropian fiction list, [...] the worst being *Inherit<br>
<a href="1925.html#1988qlink2">&gt; the Stars* and *The Great Explosion*.</a><br>

<p>
BTW, _The Great Explosion_ has recently come into print again, I just
ordered a copy. My understanding is that it's a (very funny) political
book with strong anarchist/libertarian leanings. We'll see.

<p>
Now, _Inherit the Stars_ is a fine piece of hard SF and perhaps the most
suspenseful book I've ever read, but I fail to see what's supposed to be
of particular extropian interest about it. If we're talking Hogan,
_Voyage From Yesteryear_ (just re-issued by Baen) as a Libertarian
utopia would fit the bill better.
