This is an interesting question. How do you advertise a set of ideas,
a lifestyle, a philosophy? How do you exploit and avoid the
psychological triggers people have? And for what purpose?

<p>
As I see it, what we want is 


<OL>
  <li>  Get transhumanism accepted as a valid point of view (and not just
escapism, wishful thinking or part of another movement). Without this,
nobody will listen.

  <li>  Get transhumanist ideas debated in society. Not necessarily
accepted, but made part of the overall discourse.

  <li>  Help make implementations of these ideas legal, desirable and done. 


</OL>
<p>
Where would advertising be useful? It is more about spreading a view,
a simple good/bad meme than presenting a rational argument. I think it
can be used to "initiate" these points: an advertisement promoting
transhumanism in general to make people aware there is something out
there; an advertisement forcing the viewers to ask a question; an
advertisement for a transhuman project. But they are/should not be the
end of it, just an attention-grabber to make people think and look up
the hypertexted debating site or something similar - we don't need
people who become transhumanists because it is cool or is PC, we want
people who reason.
