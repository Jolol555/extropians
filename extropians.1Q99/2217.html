<p>
Do you work in the field of computers?  I thought it was common
knowledge that Apple paid Xerox for technology.  It didn't even occur to
me to give a reference to support this.  I don't have a reference handy,
but I could try to find one.

<p>
<a href="2207.html#2217qlink2">&gt; Well, Microsoft is certainly no stranger in the Apple world, for many years</a><br>
<i>&gt; they had more programmers writing Apple programs than Apple itself did, but</i><br>

<p>
Most people forget that Microsoft started out writing software for the
Apple.  The migrate Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel to the PC
platform later.

<p>
And yes, in the beginning, Apple did want to emulate Macs on PC's.  They
thought people would migrate to the real thing after having a taste of
the emulator.  It was their lost court case that allowed anyone to
copy/emulate the Mac without paying Apple that made them lose interest
in Mac emulation.  (There are a few Mac emulators for PCs still
available today.)

<p>
<a href="2207.html#2217qlink3">&gt; And Microsoft was right. Although Bill Gates strongly advised against it</a><br>
<i>&gt; IBM insisted that the first version of OS/2 be a 16 bit system and even worse,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they wrote it in assembly language (not C) optimized to work best on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 286 chip. That decision was one of the most stupid in the history of</i><br>
<i>&gt; computers. OS/2 version 1.0 could never handle Windows 95 nor could it be</i><br>
<i>&gt; modified to do so, IBM had to start from square one to make the next version</i><br>
<i>&gt; and by then Windows had a big head start.</i><br>

<p>
I agree with this mostly, but I do know that IBM wanted to include
Windows 95 support in OS/2 and that Microsoft would not legally allow
them to do so.
