This is essentially the Vinge problem - if you believe (like many of
us do) that change is going to be exponential, then most stories
become either very near future, hopelessly weird posthuman stories, or
you have to limit things a bit. Vinge did it in AFUTD and the prequel
with his zones, many stories and games try to limit by postulating
strict restrictions or a few suitable disasters to keep tech down.

<p>
In my scenario I have just softened the exponential a bit, and added
some possible quirks (simply put, civilizations doesn't necessarily
have to transcend, they can also go into attractors or diversify
without transcending as a whole). It is not intended as serious
futurology, even if I'm aiming for hard science fiction (O great gods
of sf, forgive me for introducing FTL! :-)

<p>
I already have. It is great luck that 60% of them are transhumanists
already, and the other have been exposed to these radical
ideas. However, some of them might have a harder time swallowing a
libertarian planet than nanotech :-)
