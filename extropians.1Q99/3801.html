<a name="3803qlink1">Drexler's problem is that he did it backwards.  He wrote</a> the popular book
<a name="3806qlink1"><a name="3803qlink2">first, and then when he got ignored/flamed by academia, he went back
and got his PhD and then wrote the technical book.

<p>
And the technical book is itself an affront to the academic tradition,
aggressively interdisciplinary to the point that no specialist</a> is able to
<a name="3803qlink3">understand it.  It was like a slap in the face to his academic critics.

<p>
He will continue to be a pariah unless he decides to play the game of
academic politics.
