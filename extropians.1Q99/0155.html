<p>
I see that A Deepness in the Sky, Vernor Vinge's prequel to A Fire
Upon the Deep is coming out in February from TOR books.  From Amazon:
"Readers will marvel at Vernor Vinge's science fiction creation about
Qeng Ho who awaits planet Arachna's awakening into a Golden Age of
technology while other traders lurk nearby."

<p>
I didn't think I'd like this Qeng Ho angle.  A primitive culture, trapped
in the Slow Zone?  What I forgot is that this was the perspective of the
Beyond.  From our POV the Qeng Ho is a super-advanced civilization, with
technology comparable to the advanced travellers in Marooned in Realtime.

<p>
The prologue is online at <a href="http://www.tor.com/sampleDeepness.html">http://www.tor.com/sampleDeepness.html</a>.  It's good.
