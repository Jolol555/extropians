Well, I haven't worked for a large aerospace company like Spike does,
I've mostly worked on my own or on contract to other firms, and I will
say that when I worked at firms<a name="1194qlink1"> that were strictly architectural
engineering, there was a distinct lack of such individuals. I was
actually shocked. The last engineering firm I worked for, I was
</a>
surprised to say, was an a-hole free zone, which allowed me to finally
disprove what my father once said to me as a child, that I would find
such people no matter where I worked....
