<i>&gt; education</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;systems in the world and of all time.  All citizens have access to</i><br>
<i>&gt; education, in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;fact it is mandated for school age children barring alternative home or</i><br>
<i>&gt; other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;schooling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The United States educational system is completely backwards in how it looks</i><br>
<i>&gt; at things. Our current system was developed to produce masses of people who</i><br>
<i>&gt; had the necessary skills to work the factory jobs that came as a result of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the industrial revolution. They demand that everybody learn the exact same</i><br>
<i>&gt; subjects at the exact same time, at the exact same pace, and in the exact</i><br>
<i>&gt; same way. They deny students any sense of self-direction and</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-responsibility. They force children to learn to be spoon-fed what</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody else thinks they need to know to get through life. It's no wonder</i><br>
<i>&gt; so many adults don't know what they want to do; they are still waiting for</i><br>
<i>&gt; somebody to tell them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="3894qlink1"><a name="3874qlink2"><i>&gt; BTW, are you actually in favor of the notion of compulsory education?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Absolutely.  Compulsory education through to the threshold of adulthood</a></a> is
mandatory.

<p>
<a name="3894qlink2">In terms of academic regidity, compare to Japan, which in cases has higher
average standardized test scores, but in Japan, every student</a> throughout the
<a name="3894qlink3">country receives the same lesson on the same day of the year for their age
group.  There is almost zero curriculum flexibility.

<p>
Good curriculums should be and probably are available to all</a> subject matters in
<a name="3894qlink4">elementary and secondary schools, it's the sacred devotion</a> of ardent teachers
<a name="3894qlink5">that individualizes this curriculum,</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3853.html#3856qlink2">&gt; &gt;I had the opportunity to work for the local school district in high school</a><br>
<i>&gt; as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;computer assistant for a couple hours after school, I worked for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; special</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;services department that provides track based learning to both</i><br>
<i>&gt; developmentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;disabled and accelerated students.  They are wonderful people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have no doubt that many wonderful people are involved in the educational</i><br>
<i>&gt; field. That doesn't change my point one single bit.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;I was subjected to a rigorous public education, and am the better for it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You are the first person I have heard say that. I have heard many, many more</i><br>
<i>&gt; say otherwise. I am certainly in favor of a child's right to choose that</i><br>
<i>&gt; style of education if he wishes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I went to an excellent public high school, few match it, public or private.

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3853.html#3856qlink3">&gt; &gt;Learning is a lifelong process.  Learning isn't just about school, it's</a><br>
<i>&gt; also about</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;socialization skills and the myriad other things that make life a rich</i><br>
<i>&gt; tapestry.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; How can a school system which segragates children by age and ability level</i><br>
<i>&gt; prepare him for the real world where none of that takes place? How can a</i><br>
<i>&gt; system which denies a child any power to make his own decisions teach him</i><br>
<i>&gt; self-responsibility?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3894qlink6">Developmentally, these kids are the same age which is the closest thing</a> we have
<a name="3894qlink7">for all citizen-students of the United States to group them.

<p>
Think about being in, say, fourth grade.  Fifth graders are different,</a> as are
<a name="3894qlink8">third graders.  Normally (not to say anything is normal) your friends</a> and peers
<a name="3894qlink9">are in your classes, and you grow and mature with your age group.</a>


<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3853.html#3856qlink4">&gt; &gt;The educational system serves everyone, and as it is said, not all the</a><br>
<i>&gt; people are</i><br>
<a name="3874qlink3"><i>&gt; &gt;pleased all the time.  That said, free public education is the backbone of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;America.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unless I hallucinated my last property tax bill, public education is far</i><br>
<i>&gt; from</i><br>
<i>&gt; free.</a></i><br>

significantly less expensive than child care for all children of two working

activities have associated fees, but that is kind of different,</a> an extension of

<a name="3894qlink15">than education, which returns marvelous returns of value for costs.</a></a>

I pay taxes and live in the District of Columbia without representation, that is
to say, unconstitutional taxation without representation, which reminds me to
recommend Thoreau.
