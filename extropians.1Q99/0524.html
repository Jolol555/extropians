I hadn't thought about that implication until you pointed it out.  I think I
see what you mean.

<p>

<p>
Damn.  Oh, well - back to the grind.

<p>
Its a big limitation for me - I work a lot with complex, self-modifying
abstractions, and my ability to grasp all of a problem at once is a real
limitation on the quality of the work I can do.  I've found ways of working
around it to some extent, but I'm always looking for better methods.

<p>
Well, its hardly likely to be a *random* division, but I see your point.

<p>
<a href="0516.html#0524qlink4">&gt; The only major targetable landmark is realizing that your current</a><br>

and
<br>

<p>
Some other significant mental divides that lie on our side of SI territory:


<OL>
  <li>  Awareness of environment - almost all life has this.
  <li>  Capacity for internal mental states - probably most creatures that have a
CNS.
  <li>  Awareness of causality - probably most mammals, maybe some other animals.
  <li>  Awareness of own internal mental states - hotly debated.
  <li>  Awareness that other individuals with internal states exist - hotly
debated.
  <li>  Abstract thought, planning ability - probably just humans.
  <li>  Capacity for internal self-evaluation - some humans.


</OL>
<p>
I suspect capacity for deliberate self-modification of meme systems, and of
mechanisms for selecting meme systems, would be next - but that may just be
personal prejudice.  Most people seem to draw a line around #3 or #4.

<p>
Of course, an SI might draw the line between people and not-people at item
#3.776x10^7: "Perniction to tasmfit self-gungitation" - which just happens
to lie several steps below its most advanced cognitive abilities.
