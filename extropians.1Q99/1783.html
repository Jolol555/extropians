&gt; I think you both misunderstand the question.  We aren't talking about
some
<br>
&gt; philosophical argument about the ultimate meaning of life.  When a
physicist
<br>
&gt; asks "Why does something exist?", what he means is "What process is
&gt; responsible for the existance of observable reality?"  In some ways
this is
<br>
&gt; equivalent to asking "Why do we have these particular laws of physics,
and
<br>
&gt; not some other set of laws?"

<p>
&gt; A lot of scientists have backed away from this kind of questioning,
either
<br>
&gt; because they think it is unanswerable or because it sounds too much
like
<br>
&gt; religion.  However, it is merely the logical end result of the ongoing
quest
<br>
&gt; for a real theory of cosmology.  If it seems meaningless now, that
simply
<br>
&gt; indicates that we don't yet know enough to properly address the issue.
&gt; I think the point of disagreement is over definitions of
science/physics/existence.

<p>
I certainly believe it is valuable to investigate the tolerance limits
of the so called laws of nature.
<br>
For example playing with different values of universal constants to see
which ones can support a viable universe and which cant - this helps us
to understand the relationships between them.  However this does not,
nor will it ever explain WHY the universe exists - it only tells us HOW.

<p>
Science is about measuring things, finding out how they work -
philosophy deals with the why.
