Well, as I've said before, I think it's an interesting example of people who
profess free-market ideas suddenly changing their minds when they are the
one who are suffering; it's easy to believe in freedom and the free-market 
when you're one of those who benefit, but it's a lot harder when you're 
losing because of it.

And this is an issue we're going to see more of. Even many people here who 
talk about the delights of nanotech and SIs are going to change their minds 
when the nanotech and SIs are actually here and threatening them. In my
experience most people are far more willing to accept ideas in the abstract
than to actually follow through in reality.
