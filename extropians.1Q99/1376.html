  IAN: A constellation is also a "coherent 
  configuration" independent of the mind,
  or as independent as a galaxy is. The 
  stars that form the big dipper are 
<br>
  where they are regardless of me.

<p>
  If we say those stars are a big dipper, 
  that dipper is a superimposed identity.
  If I say one star is a candle flame, that
  too is a superimposed identity, but simply
  because I can superimpose an identity on the 
  star does not mean a star is not an entity,
  and so superimposing an identity on a group
  doesn't mean that the group isn't an entity.

<p>
  IAN: A galaxy also looks different from 
  different angles, so no point is made.
  That X looks different from different 
  angles does not mean X is a delusion.

<p>
  IAN: Your seeing a stone as a single thing, 
  not as the collection of entities it is, is
  no more or less an illusion than seeing any 
  collection of entities as a single entity.
  The "group entity illusion" is a non-case.
