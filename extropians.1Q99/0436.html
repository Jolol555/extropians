<a href="0374.html#0436qlink1">&gt; I don't understand your parsing of the term. What does the "the" mean in</a><br>

<p>
God, or divinity. If you regard the "a-" as attaching not to 
"theism", but to "theo", then you get "no-god". And then you 
attach "ism" and you get "the doctrine that there is no-god". 
Creative ethymology</a> :-)


<p>
<a href="0374.html#0436qlink2">&gt; However, I completely agree with you</a><br>
<i>&gt; that it is *possible*</i><br>

<p>
and IMO, not *exteremly* unlikely either...

<p>
<a href="0374.html#0436qlink3">&gt; that our universe is a simulation.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0374.html#0436qlink4">&gt; &gt;&gt; As you note, an agnostic is one without knowledge.</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The Companion states: "Agnosticism may be strictly personal ond </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;confessional -- 'I have no firm belief about God' -- or it may be the </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;more ambitious claim that no one ought to have a positive belief for </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;or against divine existence." So this is about belief, not knowledge.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0466qlink2"><i>&gt; I can't agree. "Gnosis" is definitely related to knowledge. The common</i><br>
<i>&gt; usage is "someone who isn't sure whether there is a god". The Dictionary of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Philosophy says: agnosticism 1. The belief (a) that we cannot have</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge of God and (b) that it is impossible to prove that God exists or</i><br>
<i>&gt; does not exist. Gnosis relates to knowledge, not belief.</i><br>

<p>
But you just cited a definition that begins "The belief ..."! Thus an 
agnostic is not one without knowledge, but one who believes either 
(a) or (b).
</a>


<p>
<a href="0374.html#0436qlink5">&gt; &gt;If you define an agnostic as one without knowledge about God, it </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;follows that there does not exist any agnostics (since knowing that </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;P implies that P is true), so that is a bad definition and not in </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;agreement with common usage.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by "without knowledge about god". When I used</i><br>
<i>&gt; that incomplete formulation, I was noting what you had said</i><br>

<p>
You was noting what Samael had said. I assumed that you and Samael 
meant "not knowing that there is a god".


<pre>
&gt;, not offering a
</pre>
<br>
<a name="0466qlink3"><a href="0374.html#0436qlink6">&gt; definition, which I think did elsewhere. An agnostic is one who thinks that</a><br>
<i>&gt; they do not or cannot know whether there is a god. </i><br>

<p>
Yes, that is correct.
 
<p>
<a href="0374.html#0436qlink7">&gt; Whether you are an agnostic or atheist about any specific god depends on</a><br>
<i>&gt; your view of what's required before you think you know something. I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; equate knowledge with certainty, which is why I call myself an atheist and</i><br>
<i>&gt; not an agnostic, at least when we're talking about the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Christian/Islamic/Jewish God.</i><br>

<p>
In that sense I am likewise an atheist.</a>
