<p>
<a href="2127.html#2173qlink1">&gt;Tim: You raise some interesting points...</a><br>
thank you kind sir.

<p>
<a href="2127.html#2173qlink2">&gt;Many of us may well agree that affirming the principles of Open Society and</a><br>
<i>&gt;Self-Direction means in practice something like a libertarian view. </i><br>
yes. so let's see if it does so in theory as well.

<p>
tim proposed the following codicil:
<br>
<a href="2127.html#2173qlink3">&gt;&gt;"Transhumans do not view any larger organisation which they may join from </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;time to time as being in any way transcendent of their individual selves. </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Their politics are constrained by this principle.</i><br>

<p>
and Max said
<br>
<a href="2127.html#2173qlink4">&gt;I don't see how this can be justified as a requirement for transhumanists</a><br>
<i>&gt;in general, though I think it does fit the Self-Direction principle of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Extropianism. Why can't there be collectivist transhumanists? (Call them</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Borgists.) Or socialist transhumanists? Or technocratic socialists</i><br>
<i>&gt;(H.G. Wells?) Or even racist transhumanists who put the transcendence of</i><br>
<i>&gt;some group first?</i><br>

<p>
Oh boy. I made big semantic mistake. There certainly can be all of these, 
as you describe in your FAQ. I made the mistake of saying "transhumanist" 
when i was thinking "extropian". Now that I understand that some 
transhumanists believe in involuntary sterilisation and genetic 
reprogramming, i will not make this mistake again.

<p>
So, wherever i have said "transhumanists" i must now say 
"extropian-transhumanist"  

<p>
Now, You [Max] then says something that really clarifies the whole issue 
for me (but will probably upset Damien B?)

<p>
<a name="2201qlink1"><a href="2127.html#2173qlink5">&gt;If someone wants to be known as a transhumanist who</a><br>
<i>&gt;rejects the idea of subordination to the collective, they can call</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves an Extropian</a> transhumanist</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2231qlink2"><a name="2201qlink2">OK. I am an extropian transhumanist. I am really happy about that but</a> Joe 
dees and Spike and maybe Natasha, as well as Damien Broderick are not 
</a>going to be. 

<p>
Max also noted that
<br>
<i>&gt;Some [transhumanists wanting to be called extropian] may favor </i><br>
<a href="2127.html#2173qlink6">&gt;government subsidies for basic research.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Personally, I do not, but if someone favored that because they believed in</i><br>
<i>&gt;"market failure" for basic research, I would not see this as incompatible</i><br>
<i>&gt;with being extropian.</i><br>

<p>
Trouble is (apart from contradicting your statement cited above), that 
the government is not a person.<a name="2177qlink1"> If these would-be 
extropian-transhumanists favour government subsidies for university 
professors like myself, they are really either:


<OL>
  <li>  Making the redundant claim that they themselves favour spending their 
own money on research.


</OL>
<p>
or else

<p>
2. Making the non redundant but also non-extropian claim that they favour 
spending other people's money on research.

</a>

<p>
Position 2 is not compatible with self-direction.
