  IAN: My calculator says it has a solution called 
  "error." Are you saying that the answer = error? :)

<p>
  But of course 1/0 is generally considered to be
  infinity, yet, like answers for 0/0, it runs into 
  problems that render it undefined or indeterminate. 
  So I think rather than it having "no solution" it
  is more exactly stated that divide by zero does 
  have solutions, but they lead to contradictions,
  and thus all /0 solutions are defined as errors.

<p>
  So, does the "no" in "There is no answer" mean 
  "error" or "nothing" as in "void"? I see it to 
  mean that the answer is void, it doesn't exist.
