Their only mention of Krugman is: "The most commonly cited example in the 
network-externality, path-dependence literature is the prosaic typewriter 
keyboard.  The importance of this example can be gleaned from Paul Krugman's 
1994 book `Peddling Prosperity.' In that book Krugman speaks glowingly of 
this entire literature in a chapter entitled "The Economics of QWERTY." He 
does, however, appear to have altered his views when made aware of the facts 
presented below."

<p>
<a name="2795qlink2">These authors don't complain about the phrase "network externality", and I 
see no reason to complain either.  Krugman did pioneer their use in a 
</a>
particular context, and he did admit that he'd been tricked by the QWERTY 
story.
