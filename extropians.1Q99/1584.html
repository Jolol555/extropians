<a name="1586qlink1">My main concern with Adam Back's scheme (the only one I've seen mentioned)
is that it's purely a cost to the sender, there's no benefit to the
recipient. Ideally it should be a transfer of value, but I can't think of
too many calculations that the average person would care much about.</a>

But I think the idea of some kind of IETF standard is a good one, as it's
a lever for getting such systems incorporated into email software.
