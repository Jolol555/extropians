<a name="2016qlink1"><a name="2014qlink1">I must admit that in *Centuries*, Attanasio does not do the best job of
capturing the superior intelligence of his metasapients, but then most authors
usually have problems in representing more-than-</a>human intelligence. Walter Jon
Williams did a good job of it in *Aristoi*, as did Charles Sheffield in
<br>
<a name="2014qlink2">*Proteus*, but I know of few writers who succeeded.</a> Any names?<br>
</a>

<p>
I personally hated one of Attanasio's books, *The Last Legends of Earth*,
which was almost a mental torture to read, even though some passages were
brilliant. I am also sometimes appalled by his cruelty (read *Wyvern* for
instance, which involves Borneo headhunters and pirates in the 17th century;
<br>
*Silent*, which I think was cowritten with a substance-abusing murderer,<br>
probably also qualifies) and irritated by his more psychedelic passages
(perhaps influenced by the likes of Carlos Castaneda), but I do think he is
one of sf's greatest authors (though I've only read seven of his novels so
far; still a dozen to go).

<p>
<a name="2016qlink2">Though I see nothing wrong in plots that pit heroes against villains, I don't
think *Centuries* is reducible to this pattern. Attanasio does a very good job
of presenting the motivations of the imploders, and though they may be
considered as callous on a cosmic scale, I think Attanasio really manages to
make them ambiguous, given that death is not final, that there is a
multiplicity of universes, and that they are after eternal bliss itself,</a> 

<p>
<a name="2026qlink1"><a name="2016qlink3">BTW, when I characterized "Inherit the Stars" as one of the worst novels on
the Extropian reading list, I meant "Voyage to Yesteryear", which I found
unreadable and totally devoid of dramatic interest. "Inherit the Stars", on
the other hand, though not great literature, is a very pleasant mystery novel
on the scale of a planetary system.</a></a>
