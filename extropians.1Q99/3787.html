<a name="3802qlink1">  <li>  Stop with the Net Etiquette Moral High Ground routine. I don't care 
if you are offended by someone's lack of snipping. Are you paying 
by-the-bit for throughput? Just shut up. If you must go on and on about 
it, email the blasphemer PRIVATELY and jaw all you want.</a>

<a name="3802qlink2">  <li>  Stop letting us all know that you reported a spammer. I don't care 
whether you did or didn't. Am I supposed to pat you on the back in 
thanks? Why doesn't it occur to you that two posts that are irrelevant 
to the list are worse than one? Are you a fool?</a>

<a name="3802qlink3">  <li>  Put your DAMN SCORECARDS AWAY. I don't care who coined what term. I 
don't care who said what about you. I don't care if you came up with an 
idea in 1905 before anybody else. I don't care if you scored a 3,000,000 
on the SAT when you were 5 months old. I don't care who you know.</a>

<a name="3802qlink4">  <li>  Stop being infantile.</a> Who cares if someones clock is wrong? Who cares 
<a name="3802qlink5">about your mouse? Who cares that someone offended you? Who cares if you 
feel you must respond publicly? If you think someone else's drivel is 
bad for the list, don't you think that adding your own drivel is only 
increasing the problem?</a>
