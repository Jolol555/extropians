<a href="2675.html#2706qlink1">&gt; Thanks Tim for your thoughtful words.  However, I feel compelled to do more.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropians are working on life extension and imortality for themselves and</i><br>
<i>&gt; theirs.  What about my neighbor?  What about my Dad who died 7 years ago?  Who</i><br>
<i>&gt; has a mother, father, son or daughter who's died? What about their life</i><br>
<i>&gt; extension?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2675.html#2706qlink2">&gt; Tipler convinced me that, some day, us, our successors or beings from other</a><br>
<i>&gt; civilizations on other planets will have the technology (at minimal cost to</i><br>
<i>&gt; them) to bring us all back in the huge, holy computers of the future.</i><br>

<p>
If you believe in Tipler, do nothing at all - it has already been done for
us.

<p>
If like me you hold out a scant hope that some future generation may
reconstruct you from partial brain patterns left in artifacts you create -
create unique artifacts, paint, invent, build, write.

<p>
If you are caring of your neighbors, don't bother them with this stuff.
Well, maybe buy them Tipler's book and let them make the next move.
Certainly no more than that: they are in their 80s for gods sake.

<p>
love,
<br>
tim
