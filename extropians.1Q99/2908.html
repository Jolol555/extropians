Anders, I believe you expressed the concern that the concept of immortality
<a name="2933qlink2">for all might encourage passivity.  I agree this is a serious concern.</a>  For
<a name="2933qlink3">those who would like immortality for all, I suggest the following
philosophical stance.  
<pre>
1) I want there to be some agency providing immortality for all.
2) I do not have any strong proof that there is such an agency.
3) Therefore, I should have the following goals.
</pre>

<OL>
  <li>  Discover a means to provide immortality for all.
  <li>  Ensure that someone is providing immortality for all.

</a>

</OL>
<p>
This, I believe, is an approach to the goal of immortality for all which
<a name="2933qlink4">incorporates the Extropian principles of Practical Optimism</a> and Rational
Thinking. 
<br>
In a way, there is an implied agreement between those who are pursuing
immortality for all, that if I don't make it, you'll bring me back.  An
existential mutual defense treaty.  And the hope is, that if enough people
<a name="2933qlink6">hold this goal and try enough approaches, someone might find a way</a> to do.
<a name="2933qlink7">Indeed, someone might do it before you, but until you know</a> that, you've still
<a name="2933qlink8">got to work on the project.

Great Glen, we agree.  The first step, I think, is then to form an
organization designed to focus on this ultimate prisoner's dilemna and
structured to last long enough to make it happen.  What do you think?
