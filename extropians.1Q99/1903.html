<p>
  IAN: That's a false claim! How have 
<br>
  I changed the numbers in any way? True,
  they do say "approximate" and that 
<br>
  should be noted, but they give exact
<br>
  altitudes, exactly the same as I gave. 

<p>
  What other numbers should/could I have given?


<p>
<a href="1895.html#1903qlink2">&gt;That makes the whole thing pretty clear, with synchronisation to eye </a><br>
<i>&gt;witness accounts. I had no idea the explosion was so dramatic. </i><br>

<p>
  IAN: The maximum psi for a fuel- 
<br>
  air explosion is around 60 psi.
<br>
  Many engineers believe it will 
<br>
  not even rip open a fuel tank.

<i>&gt;I mean, the plane was decapititated, </i><br>
<a href="1895.html#1903qlink3">&gt;powered up with the changed in centre of gravity, </a><br>

<p>
  IAN: Can you please explain how a center 
  of gravity shift "powers up" an airframe?
  If lift is on your mind, there's more 
  to it than that. Lift causes climb and 
  climb increases drag, which requires 
<br>
  greater thrust, particularly to have 
<br>
  achieved the approx 50 mps climb rate,
  5 times greater than the book-value rate.


<p>
exploded again, 
<br>
<a href="1895.html#1903qlink4">&gt;propelling itself downward violently, then proceeded to dismember itself </a><br>
<i>&gt;in an horrific fire ball. What the hell is there to cover up in this </i><br>
<i>&gt;sequence?</i><br>

<p>
  IAN: What exploded at the apex? I was in
  error when I said the wing came of at the 
  top. The CIA says, as I recall, that the 
  engines died nearing the apex, which they 
  would have done shortly after a pitch up; 
  as aviation mechanics will tell you, 
<br>
  engines flame out after sharp pitch up.
