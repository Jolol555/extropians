If one examines the fossil record, corals historically are the hardest hit
during climatic changes. Their diversity and abundance has fluctuated
dramatically through time.

<p>
CFC usage has been dramatically reduced only in most developing nations
(although there is a substantial black market I hear).
In developing nations, CFC's are still widely used in vast amounts.
Furthermore, a lot of these CFC's used by developing nations are
manufactured in North America! AFAIK, It is still legal to produce them,
just not to use them.
<br>
I've also read that the alternative coolants used in CFC-free countries are
almost just as detrimental to the ozone and general environment as CFC's!

<p>
It doesn't sound to me like the ozone hole will be getting any better for a
long time to come (unless we develop and deploy a method of mopping up all
the CFC's in the stratosphere)
