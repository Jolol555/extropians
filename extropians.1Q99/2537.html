will call DNA1 to  explain the creation and assembling of life, so why
there isn't  a DNA2 to explain the creation and assembling of the
Universe or Universes out there?...</a> Another biological or physical
entity functioning in the realm of the very BIG as the other DNA
functions in the realm of the very small...
<a name="2584qlink1">Isn't this in a sense the theory of the Unified Field that Einestein
spent the rest of his years looking for? The unity of the big and small?
