<p>
 As the value of the shares drops below zero, the value of the puts starts
rising at the same rate that the value of the shares drop.
 This probably depends on my implicit assumption that it will be possible
to trade shares whose value is negative. I'm confident that that would be
the most efficient way to handle the unlimited liability. I suspect you are
assuming that trading stops when the share value drops below zero.

<a href="0829.html#1011qlink2">&gt;&gt;  people would find they could live with the risks even without buying the </a><br>

<i>&gt;I can't speak for most people, but I know it FEELS different to me to invest</i><br>

<i>&gt;.</i><br>

<p>
 And investing in GM feels different from buying an internet startup before
the IPO. Buying on margin feels different from buying on a purely cash basis.
Selling short feels different from buying. I see a wide range of risks. I
doubt you would give much thought to the possibility that buying the S&amp;P 500
would expose you to a risk greater than your investment.
