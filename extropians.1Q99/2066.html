Perhaps, one should bear in mind cultural differences and the speed at 
which beliefs and values change.

<p>
For instance, the reason why Japan waited so long before starting 
investing in other countries' economies is not xenophobia but the 
concept of "amae." In short, amae presupposes superior-inferior or even 
parent-child relationship, that is the way Japan viewed their relation 
to the US. So, why would they bother about playing more actively on the 
international arena? 

<p>
However, as the Japanese economy was getting better, and especially, 
when the exports from Japan to US outweighed US imports to Japan, the 
relattionship was broken by US statement that Japan should revise its 
international political economy.

<p>
Japan acts somewhat different now, since it realized that it is not a 
minor player anymore (finally they got it :) Currently, Japan is one of 
the major aid-givers, and it provides most of the help for Eastern Asia.

<p>
<a name="2079qlink1"><a name="2069qlink1">Regarding non-tariff barriers for import...huh, Japan is not the only 
country that does it. How about bananas and EC? And what about India 
with its against-patent regulations, and even US (regulations regarding 
textile and apparel products aimed against EC)?</a></a>

<p>
Beliefs change gradually and practices change even slower. The idea of 
liberalization and open trade is relatively new.

you

<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

money

It
