Hey, I was there.

Problem.  He claims computer doubling is now once a year, and also makes
noises about what computers will be like in 2050.  Possibly that's just for
effect, but assuming 50 doublings from now -- he claimed 32 in the past
century -- is a lot.  A 10^15 increase in power for the same cost.

<p>
<a href="1083.html#1091qlink3">&gt; The audience was either already well informed or just took all of this in</a><br>

<p>
I got the impression from watching people near me that some number were amused
and disbelieving.  "What a freak."

<p>
Question that wasn't asked: what about the exponential increase in cost of
research and manufacture?  (Well, fab plants get more and more expensive.)

<p>
<a href="1083.html#1091qlink4">&gt; Overall I thought Kurzweil presented his ideas very reasonably.</a><br>
<i>&gt; No hint of 'gee whiz'.  </i><br>

<p>
True.  He also began the talk with a demonstration of his speech recognition
software, which seemed to work well after being adjusted to the acoustics.

<p>
I got no feel for how this book might differ from the Age of Intelligent
Machines, not that I know anything about that book.

<p>
Neil Gaiman the next day was a much more amusing speaker.

<p>
(On Searle:)

<p>
<a href="1083.html#1091qlink5">&gt; Nothing amazing there.  The interesting thing is that he claimed</a><br>
<i>&gt; that a century ago there were intense debates about whether life</i><br>
<i>&gt; could have a purely biological foundation.  Many postulated that</i><br>
<i>&gt; for a thing to be alive it needed a mystical 'life force', which</i><br>
<i>&gt; the mechanics of biology would never suffice to produce.  Very</i><br>

<p>
Century, hah.  Dawkins in _Unweaving the Rainbow_ quoted some 1920s or 30s
text describing 'the gene', and then going on to caution that the student
should not make the mistake of thinking that the gene was a concrete thing;
that while it played a role in biology analogous to the atom in chemistry, it
was not a thing like an atom, and had no meaning outside of a living spell.

<p>
Then came Watson, Crick, and their unnamed assistant, and vitalism died a
quick death.  When you can extract a gene into a test tube, copy it, put the
copies into unrelated cells, and get the protein back... well, what can one
say?

<p>
I expect copying minds back and forth would cause a similar cessation of
debate.  Not total, some would still insist the minds weren't minds, but
similar.
