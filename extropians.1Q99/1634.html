Abstract
<br>
  The antioxidative effects of grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPC) were studied
  in three in-vitro models in which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in
  aqueous solution and mice liver or brain microsomes were used as oxidative
  substrates, and UV-C irradiation as the pro-oxidant system. Analysis of UV-C
  induced lipid peroxidation was carried out by two methods: gas liquid
  chromatography of residual PUFAs and release of thiobarbituric acid-reactive
  substances (TBARs) measured by TBA reaction. Results indicate that PUFAs are
  more radiosensitive when incorporated in single component micelles than in
  mixed component micelles or microsomes. In every case, PUFA peroxidation was
  inhibited by low concentrations of GSPC (2 mg/L) while epigallocatecin (EGC)
  and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) monomers, at an equivalent level of
  epicatechin, exhibited no efficacy in our experimental conditions. This
  latter effect might be explained by a synergistic action of flavan-3-ol
  monomers, dimers and oligomers contained in the grape seed extract.
