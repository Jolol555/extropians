Greetings merry extropians.  Thank you for the scoop on the CNN and Time
stories, as well as the many other great tips that I have gleaned from
this list.  You are a all a big part of my life.  

<p>
I hope you don't mind my lurking too much.  I'm a poor grad student, and
time is limited.  Plus, I'm not sure that I fit in entirely, so I lurk
and benefit from your clearly brilliant intelligence.  Here are a few
key points, which you may address, if you like.


<OL>
  <li>  I'm not hot on the idea of cryonics.  ;-}
  <li>  Based on my own subjective experiences, I am entirely convinced
that consciousness is non-temporal.
  <li>  Cryonics is, at best, a last resort.
  <li>  I'm not a strict atheist, in fact, I'm a devout mormon.
  <li>  The mormon "god" is like a successful extropian.
  <li>  I'm not a strict libertarian.  You could say that I am an extremely
liberal, left-wing, libertarian.
  <li>  Bring on the national ID cards.
  <li>  Send welfare mothers back to school.
  <li>  National enterprise is glorious.
  <li>  Environmentalism is good.
  <li>  Entropy is part of the life process.
  <li>  We would not exist w/o certain entropy driven processes.



</OL>
<p>
Get the idea?  Despitely these points, which most of you I think would
disagree with, we are probably in complete agreement on most everything
else.  For example;

<p>
5.  I'm a scientist (biochemist/crystallographer).

<OL>
  <li>  the method of science leads to truth and technological advances,
which as a net benefit, uplifts humanity.
  <li>  I am excited about the possibility of enhancing human experience and
intelligence through drugs and implants
  <li>  ... and through uploading/downloading.
  <li>  I would like to have the whole web in my head.
  <li>  I am engaged in an intensive life extension program.  
  <li>  I am going for immediate quality of life improvements
  <li>  ... and increased longevity.


</OL>
<p>
I feel that points 1-4 are coherent with regard to points 5-7.
