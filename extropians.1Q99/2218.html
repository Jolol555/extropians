I stand corrected!  My research indicates that Apple did not PAY for
information from Xerox.  He legally obtained the rights to the
technology without any cost.  Xerox invited Steve Jobs in and let him
look around for free.  The Xerox execs didn't think that ethernet and
the gui interface were useful as anything but toys.  The point I
misrepresented was that Xerox agreed that Apple had legal rights to use
their ideas, whereas Apple thought they had sold their ideas to
Microsoft for money, and Microsoft later used the ideas without paying.

<p>
I am watching this discussion with interest because an computer security
idea of mine might be patented by IBM.  I will allow them to do so, but
I'm not sure what I believe about the idea of patent restrictions.  I am
concerned about cryptopgraphy patents where a mathematical algoritm is
restricted.  How do you pass laws to prevent certain mathematical values
from being calculated?  (My idea has nothing to do with cryptography.  I
can't say what my idea involves, due to client contracts,
confidentiality, and lawyers.)
