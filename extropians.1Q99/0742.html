On the one hand, I have to agree with Harvey Newstrom that debates about
these topics tend to be remarkably sterile - anyone who cares about these
issues already has an opinion, and is unlikely to change it.  OTOH, one of
the major things we stand to accomplish here is helping each other figure
out how to cope with (and take advantage of) the future - and that means
more than just technology.

<p>
IMHO, the problem arises when we forget where we are, and start arguing
about a mundane topic (like gun control) from the perspective of the society
we live in.  That reduces us to dissecting the mistakes of the past, and
assuming we are doomed to repeat them.  Then we get a thread that could just
as easily have originated in alt.politics, alt.religion, etc.

<p>
Surely we can do better than that.  Aren't we supposed to be the ones who
can see that the future will be different than the past?  We should be
focusing on how to solve problems in the future, not on how our ancestors
should have done it 10, 100 or 1000 years ago.
