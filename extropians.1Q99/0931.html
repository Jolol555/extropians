Abstract
<br>
  The purpose of this study was to determine if
  the penetration enhancer
<br>
  SEPA (2-n-nonyl-1,3-dioxolane) would augment the scalp hair
  growth effects of topical minoxidil in the balding stumptail
  macaque. A 1-in2 area on the balding scalp of 40 adult
  female monkeys (four drug-treated and four vehicle-treated groups of 5
  monkeys each) was topically treated 5 days/week, q.d. or b.i.d., with
  approximately 250 microliters of minoxidil-SEPA (2.5% minoxidil,
  weight/volume in 10% SEPA, 25% propylene glycol and 65% isopropyl alcohol),
  Rogaine topical solution (TS, 2% minoxidil, weight/volume in 20% propylene
  glycol, 60% ethanol and 20% water) or respective vehicles (without drug) for
  16 weeks via paintbrush application. Scalp hair was collected by shaving and
  vacuuming the dosed area at baseline and at 4-week
  intervals. The shaved hair was filtered, weighed and
  recorded as the change from baseline. The
  q.d. and b.i.d. minoxidil-SEPA groups displayed a significant increase in
  hair weight compared to their respective vehicles at week 4
  whereas q.d. and b.i.d. Rogaine TS groups were not active until week 8 and
  12, respectively. Both minoxidil-SEPA treatments produced significantly
  greater cumulative hair weight over the entire 16-week study
  compared to either of the Rogaine TS
<br>
  treatments. Comparable increases in cumulative hair weight were evident
  between q.d. and b.i.d. minoxidil-SEPA groups and between q.d. and b.i.d.
  Rogaine TS groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
