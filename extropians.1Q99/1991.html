<a name="1997qlink1">&gt; I think you misunderstood me. If your spaceship accelerates at 1 G, a
&gt; classical calculation would say that after one year you would travel
&gt; faster than c. However, in relativity (and as evidenced in particle
&gt; accelerators) even a constant acceleration doesn't lead to a velocity
&gt; greater than c. What happens is that the mass of the accelerated
&gt; object increases as 1/sqrt(1-(v/c)^2) and the energy needed to
&gt; accelerate it to a few percent higher velocity diverges.

<a name="1993qlink1">The energy needed to accelerate it from it's _starting_ point increases,
but not the energy it needs to accelerate itself.
<a name="1997qlink2">An object/vessel which is capable of generating it's own thrust will not
need to output more power to maintain a constant acceleration the
further it gets from it's origin.
