I've lately thought that on Mon, 01 Mar 1999, Timothy Bates wrote:

<p>
I don't.  That it, saying this supposes that either I am responsible for
others' actions, or that I have a default contract with everyone to 
supply only information I know is good.  I think everyone is responsible
for their own actions, *even if* they are verbally instructed to take some
given action.<a name="2654qlink2">  Also, I do not believe that lying should be illegal, when 
it is not fraud (returning no value for value recieved.</a>

<p>
But this is so because the *gun* cannot be responsible, no?

<p>
<a href="2573.html#2608qlink3">&gt;If you say "Bill, kill tim and I will give you 5 grand" that is a crime. Not</a><br>
<i>&gt;because of the speech per se. but because of the contract it creates: a</i><br>
<i>&gt;contract to initiate force. I support that.</i><br>

<p>
I don't.

<p>
<a href="2573.html#2608qlink4">&gt;Is that a reasonable position: free speech = all speech which does not</a><br>
<i>&gt;directly aid specific acts of violence?</i><br>

<p>
It is reasonable, however, I think it wrong, as well.

<p>
<a href="2573.html#2608qlink5">&gt;Food for thought:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What is speech that it is free where action is not? When is speech action?</i><br>

<p>
When it *causes* action, as in the voice-activated gun you
proposed.

<p>
<a href="2573.html#2608qlink6">&gt;Why are we not free to speak lies (that is libel)?</a><br>

<p>
We should be. :)
