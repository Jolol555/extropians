<a name="3416qlink1"><a name="3415qlink1"><a name="3406qlink1"><a name="3405qlink1">My mother, once prolific, has not written a word since she quit
smoking.  It is a well know anecdote among writers, that if you quit
smoking, you are out of work.  Sadly, it appears to be some kind of
mental block, probably based on brain recptors.  Similarly, I believe
that there were some jazz players who couldn't improvise without a
cigarette in the mouth.</a>

<p>
Does anyone know something more about this problem?  Is it a promising
area of research?  Is there any way for me to help my mother, who has
now been blocked for years, even though she hasn't touched</a> tobacco again
</a>
<a name="3406qlink2"><a name="3405qlink2">over that time?  I feel that she just needs proper assistance in order
to regain her gift.

<p>
