My friend (I hope) Brent Allsop stated:

<p>
<a href="2674.html#2698qlink1">&gt;Scott Badger &lt;wbadger@psyberlink.net&gt; replied about how to respond to</a><br>
<i>&gt;dieing fiends:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Persuade her to consider cryonic preservation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If a religious person came to me when I was on my death bead</i><br>
<i>&gt;and tried to persuade me to do something like "repent and believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jesus so that I might be saved" I'd be terribly offended and hurt by</i><br>
<i>&gt;such an act.</i><br>


<p>
OK, but many non-religious persons would not be offended.  It would depend
somewhat on how the subject were approached.

<p>
<a href="2672.html#2698qlink2">&gt; What are the odds that any average Joe or Jane, on their death</a><br>
<i>&gt;bed, would not be offended by an extropian preaching the possibility</i><br>
<i>&gt;of cryonic salvation?</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2672.html#2698qlink3">&gt; Pushing cryonics is of course the action I'd like to take when</a><br>
<i>&gt;faced with the death of a friend or family member.  But how will they</i><br>
<i>&gt;take it?  Just how much of this can we do for how many people?  When</i><br>
<i>&gt;death isn't close most people aren't to receptive to the idea of</i><br>
<i>&gt;cryonics.  Does this ever change when people are actually on it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;doorstep?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
It's my understanding that cryonics firms are faced with last-minute sign-up
attempts fairly frequently.  I'm not sure what portion are initiated by the
proposed cryonaut and what portion are initiated by a loved one, but it
would be interesting to find out.

<p>
I leave it to Adrian, of course, to determine the advisability of raising
the idea of cryonics since he is familiar with the situation.  But if
someone I cared for was about to die, I'd sure bring it up.  I don't expect
to suddenly accept God on my deathbed and most will probably find it just as
difficult to accept cryonics on their deathbed.  I'd still have to try, but
that's me.

<p>
I think people are likely to be more open to cryonics if they are relatively
young and on their death bed with some terminal condition.  But many of the
elderly are psychologically ready for death and the release from pain it
promises.  In their minds, there's just no hope of ever being healthy and
pain-free again.  That's a tough meme to crack.  Still, some are likely to
be open to the hope that cryonics may offer and will see precious little to
lose by taking action.

<p>
Long life to all,

<p>
Scott
