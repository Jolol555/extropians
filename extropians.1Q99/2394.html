In the film ``Bladerunner'' the androids ("replicants") did not know they
were androids.  When they did find out, they did not like it.

<p>
the main character of the film, Deckard, might or might not have been an
android. We never find out, but there exists a number of hints in the film
to suggest he was.

<p>
The android ``Rebecca'' who finds that all her life has been a lie becomes
confused, and changes her life style.

<p>
I suggest that a sentience would re-compute its personality when it finds out
it has been under mind control.  Humans do it.
