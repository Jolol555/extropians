Recently I got this interesting piece of spam:

"BOOST YOUR SEX APPEAL AND CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL AND SEX LIFE FOREVER. 

<p>
Scientists have isolated the natural Human male/female Pheromone attractants and
they are NOW available to YOU, legally, in the US. 

<p>
[snip]<br>

<p>
Pheromones are natural chemicals which play an important role in sexual
communication. 

<p>
       Animals, including humans release chemicals in tears, saliva and
perspiration. These chemicals send signals relating to mood and health to the
subconscious awareness.  One theory is that the dominant male will exude more of
these chemical attractants than a submissive or weaker male.
This chemical attracts more females to him.  It is similar for woman
attracting men. This natural attractant can also contribute to more intense
excitement during love making (sexual foreplay and sexual intercourse). Pheromones
may also contribute to the dating phrase, "chemical attraction" that we all talk
about.  WSVN-TV (March 3, 1998)

Hi-Octane (tm) 

<p>
. is made up of PHEROMONES suspended in witch hazel.. This product is designed to be
added to your favorite cologne or perfume. 
.contains both male and female PHEROMONES. Nature never intended for just one
PHEROMONE to be present; but two, male and female. Our manufacturering process uses
both PHEROMONES in ALL our products. This will not attract same sex;  but works as
nature intended, attracting the opposite sex. 

<p>
HI_OCTANE is made with two powerful synthesized human 
pheromones, Alpha-Androstenol and Alpha-Androstenone."

I'm not sure about the effectiveness of this particular product, but
the underlying idea certainly seems logical: use pheromones to
score (this is just one of many potential applications, of course). 
Very transhuman. Why rely on chance and bother with cumbersome 
mating rituals when you can simply splash on some pheromones 
and go stand next to your desired partner. "Ahem".

<p>
Well, that's the theory anyway. Obviously there must be a glitch 
somewhere, or else (synthetic) pheromones would be "bigger" than 
Viagra by now. Anyone know more about this?
