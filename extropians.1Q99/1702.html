Eliezer S. Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt; posted some info
questioning the possibility that this is really what it claims.  I
drilled down a bit more trying to find some real substance to these
outragious claims.  I think I found the primary secret to it all in
paragraph 10 on their "about.html" page:

<p>
<i>&gt; This means that SBS's Hypercomputer systems work faster and more</i><br>
<i>&gt; like the human mind than other computing systems.  There are two</i><br>
<i>&gt; obvious benefits to a system that is a more natural extension of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; human thought process. First, the operator is able to more</i><br>
<i>&gt; efficiently interface with the system. It is simpler to</i><br>
<i>&gt; operate. Second, the system can be used to imitate the human</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind. The power of an electronic computer has no meaning if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot be translated into results the human mind can absorb and</i><br>
&gt; comprehend. Compatibility with human thinking renders an electronic<br>
&gt; computer more efficient and more responsive.<br>

<p>
	How could anyone miss this?  Of course "compatibility with
human thinking renders an electronic computer more efficient and more
responsive"!  I wonder why no one has thought of this before now! ;)
Can someone tell us what it feels like to have one's mind "absorb and
comprehend" data from such a powerful computing device? It must be
like interacting with God himself! ;)
