I'm betting you've already seen this but the Life Extension Foundation
provides a number of readings on this topic at the bottom of

<p>
<a href="http://lef.org/cgi-local/shop.pl/page=june-cover97.html">http://lef.org/cgi-local/shop.pl/page=june-cover97.html</a>

<p>
Here's an excerpt from that page:
<hr>
<br>
"Two secretagogues are now well into clinical trials in this country. The
first one developed, GHRP 6, is a growth hormone-releasing peptide being
tested by Wyeth-Ayerst. It has now been tested and is remarkably free of
side effects, according to its developer, Cyril Bowers, Ph.D., of Tulane
Medical School in New Orleans.

<p>
The second compound, MK0577, developed by scientists at Merck, does not have
a typical peptide structure and is more easily absorbable by the body than
growth hormone-releasing peptides such as GHRP 6. The latest clinical trials
in men and women aged 64 to 81 showed that as little as 25 mg of the drug
taken once a day for two weeks raised the levels of IGF-1 from an average of
141 to 219, with the highest levels reaching a youthful 251. And it appears
to be well-tolerated by elderly people. If any of these compounds are
approved by the FDA, and considering the impact that growth hormone has been
shown to have on almost every system of the body, aging as we know it may
soon be a thing of the past."

<p>
And the price of $18.71 (member price) for a 30 day supply compared to
VesPro's $90.00 price tag.

<p>
Sounds like it's worth a try to me.  Let's take some before and after
pictures!
