Hmm.  I've had a few similar experiences, but I don't trust my unconscious
processing that far.  I want everything checked via (painfully slow)
conscious, sequential analysis before I change anything that fundamental.  I
remember spending several days chewing over the consequences of some of the
big realizations.

<p>
Most people don't even go that far.  If we translate "fundamental values" as
"what criteria are used in selecting and prioritizing goals", we can see
why.  It takes an awfully big shock to trigger a re-evaluation of something
that fundamental, and most people have a strong conservative impulse that
limits changes to a small scale in most situations.

<p>
Of course, once again we come upon the fact that smarter, more creative
minds are more likely to experience such revelations, and to act on them.
Personally, I'm with you on this one - if we're going to make something that
could become &gt;H, we should concentrate on making it sane and giving it all
the facts.  If we succeed there, it will end up making better moral
judgments than we can.
