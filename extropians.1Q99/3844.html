<a href="3843.html#3844qlink2">&gt; The United States has one of the best and most forward thinking public</a><br>
education
<br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink3">&gt; systems in the world and of all time.</a><br>

<p>
I'm not debating that it isn't evolved. That is an obvious fact. Its just
that we still produce poorly educated people despite all its magnitude. Our
standards for education are lower than most other large industrialized
nations. (e.g. Japan)

<p>
All citizens have access to education, in
<br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink4">&gt; fact it is mandated for school age children barring alternative home or other</a><br>
<i>&gt; schooling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I had the opportunity to work for the local school district in high school as</i><br>
a
<br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink5">&gt; computer assistant for a couple hours after school, I worked for the special</a><br>
<i>&gt; services department that provides track based learning to both developmentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; disabled and accelerated students.  They are wonderful people.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I am the product of a self-taught and public education, and attended a private</i><br>
<i>&gt; college.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course, individuals have different experiences with education, as well they</i><br>
<i>&gt; certainly should!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The thing that I feel has helped me the most is the skill of reading and</i><br>
having
<br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink6">&gt; learned to read somewhat intuitively from the ages of 3 to 7 for basic reading</a><br>
<i>&gt; skills, and 8 to now for advanced reading skills.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I was subjected to a rigorous public education, and am the better for it.</i><br>

<p>
Perhaps your learning style fit with the mean style of education. But too
many go neglected because they don't learn the way you do.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink7">&gt; Learning is a lifelong process.  Learning isn't just about school, it's also</a><br>
about
<br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink8">&gt; socialization skills and the myriad other things that make life a rich</a><br>
tapestry.

<p>
This is why I left private school to go to a public highschool, which was
mostly an education in socialization and people skills.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink9">&gt; It is not good that not every student has the same opportunities, that is, not</a><br>
all
<br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink10">&gt; public schools are the same, but at the same time,  I feel almost any person</a><br>
if
<br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink11">&gt; raised and educated well could surpass, for example, me, whom I consider well</a><br>
<i>&gt; educated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The educational system serves everyone, and as it is said, not all the people</i><br>
are
<br>
<a href="3843.html#3844qlink12">&gt; pleased all the time.  That said, free public education is the backbone of</a><br>
<i>&gt; America.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I would argue military is the backbone of America. If only based on the
distribution of financial resources. America is a VERY wealthy country. Yet,
our public school teachers are paid so poorly that most decide to quit after
less than 5 years of teaching.


<p>
All I was trying to say, is that it COULD be much better if the people in
power wanted it to be. Educating our young effectively should be our biggest
national goal, but it is not.


<p>
The Space program used to be our national goal, but today it seems there is
little or no National GOAL. Other than to pretend to play big-brother to the
economic interests we have in the world.
