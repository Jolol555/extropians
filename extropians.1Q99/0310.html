<p>
Yes, the heat from reentry is mostly in the shock wave. The reason the shuttle
needs its tiles is that so much of its surface is at the shockwave. A longer
leaner vehicle will keep most of its surface away from the shockwave.

<p>
This is why I like the solid liquid hybrid motors, it allows for a very small
cross section, and the fuel provides structural support just as normal solid fuels
do. A small cross section with a dense fuel allows for a small vehicle size, and
the aerodynamic savings of the small cross section are enormous at transonic to
hypersonic speeds.

<p>
rotating seals are ok, because the pressure is generated by the centrifugal forces
of the spinning blades, so at the point where the blades and the tanks meet, you
can have a very low pressure seal, because there should be a significant vacuum
pressure inside the seal.
