How about in the UK (as repotted on BBC radio) where they are proposing 
to incarcerate people who might commit a crime in the future.

<p>
In particular, for having a personality disorder. My jaw dropped.

<p>
The polly was saying 
<br>
"in the past people with personality disorders have gone on to hurt 
people and we cannot let this happen again"
+
<br>
"we cannot wait for the science on this one"

<p>
oh right.

<p>
There is massive overlap between the personality disorders themselves 
(comorbidity), and serious (Axis 1 in DSM) disorders such as depression 
and anxiety, as well as with normal personality (the best predictor of 
personality disorder apart from a clinical diagnosis is simply  unusually 
high levels of emotionality (Neuroticism).

<p>
Essentially, this guy is suggesting that the government be given cart 
<a name="1978qlink1">blanch to imprison around half of the population. And even then, not on 
the basis of evidence of misdeeds, but by opinions about internal motives 
and processes - talk about an invitation for witch hunting.</a>
