Vietnam was a wholly criminal affair.  Those who believed or believe otherwise

Well Jeff, I knew you were skulking around out there, seething in your simple,
bitter mind.  The above statement, as well as most of your others, clearly
displays your knee jerk self-serving dogmatism. 

<p>
If you are capable of a more specific assertion with some foundation on a
point by point basis (saying "read Chomsky" is the same as saying read Jane
Fonda) I would be happy to engage you in a dialog, but your infantile sweeping
generalizations are worthy of nothing but scorn.

I was in Saigon in the Merchant Marine delivering war material in the sixties
before I joined the Navy where I served in the Pacific on shipboard.  It was a
great adventure.
