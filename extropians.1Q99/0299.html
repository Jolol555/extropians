I would think there are lots of micron-sized particles leaving our
solar system now. A gray goo capable of passive or even active solar 
sailing or of other, active means of panspermia would obviously seem 
to have lots of evolutionary advantages. Due to co-evolutionary 
pressure you can obviously get arbitrarily complex autoreplicators, 
up to the level of sentience. (As autoreplicators can't emerge
spontaneously, they will obviously have potential for advanced 
infoprocessing capabilities right from the start. Since brittle
autoreplicators are containable, the emerged autoreplicators will be
nonbrittle in respects to evolutionary optimization).

P.S.	You non-believers in the gray goo being dangerous are really
<a name="0398qlink1"><a name="0371qlink1">	scary. Arriving at rash conclusions, often riddled with 
	obvious logical flaws and basing further course of action upon
	these is imo dangerously unresponsible behaviour. We need
	nano-CERT, and quick.
