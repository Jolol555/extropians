Sorry to everyone on the list for what appeared to be spam.  That url
leads to a very lame porno site with no relation to realdolls.  I was
unable to confirm my recollection of the url from work at NASA because
visiting a site like that raises major red flags in their automated
big brother system.  Anyway, the intended url is

<p>
<a href="http://realdoll.com/">http://realdoll.com/</a>

<p>
These dolls were featured on HBO's Real Sex 22 and their visual
appearance makes suspension of disbelief very easy.  I am forwarding

Since that Real Dolls link was nothing but a sinister porn ad, I'll
try and fill y'all in on these $5000 doodads.

<p>
Note: Some of this is my research, most is the HBO Real Sex 22 episode
that featured the Real Dolls.



<p>
They sure do cost $5000, and what you're paying for is an amazing
sculpture job, as well as a huge amount of silicon. They seem to be
female-only at the moment (though a few "chicks with you-know-whats"
have been created on a special order basis), so their breasts,
behinds, and various other spots are comprised of this high-grade
silicon. They seem to be coated in the stuff, actually. This makes
them soft to the touch, and yielding, but still pretty rubbery.

<p>
There are all sorts of dorky little details regarding their sexy
features, including a weird little suction action that takes place due
primarily to the properties of plastic, rubber, etc. And the hair (all
the hair) is human.

<p>
The Doll itself is created like a big squishy action figure, with
plastic bones and joints (gaps where the rubber takes over) in all the
right places. You can position it as you want, and it will basically
stay put.

<p>
Anyway, all of that is pretty uninteresting, at least as far as
sexbots go. It's a high-class blow-up doll, and for what it's worth,
they really are exquisitely sculpted (I'm talking facial features,
dammit!)

<p>
The sexbot issue is being addressed, though, as various animatronic
features have been planned (and partially built) by the couple
responsible for these silicon lovelies. Here are the prospective
specs, in order of complexity.

<p>
-Moving tongue and eyes
<p>
        Once activated, they keep moving. A feature will be added to
start
<br>
just one (eyes or tongue) at a time

<p>
-Audio
<p>
        Again, cued in with the moving parts, the dreadful thing starts
moaning.

<p>
-Moisture
<p>
        Figure it out

<p>
-Tactile Audio
<p>
        Now this one is scary. "Nerves" implanted in various erogenous
zones
<br>
will send signals to the primitive "arousal computer", and if the
right things are done (like a dirty version of Electronic
Simon)...Machine Orgasm! At which point it acts bored until you
finally cuddle with it. Well, maybe not. But honestly, it reaches an
orgasm, or so they plan, but only minor development has been completed
(these people are about as tech-illiterate as you can get). They also
plan to give the Dolls a rudimentary learning capability, so as to
learn what you like to do to it, and thus pretend to enjoy those
actions more. You wanted decadence? You got it!

<p>
Now they didn't mention how well these dolls are doing, but suffice it
to say that the couple is in the shop every day, and their stock isn't
exactly sky-rocketing. However, it's fascinating to note that people
will pay $5000 and up for the most primitive sexbot around (right now
it has none of those special features), which leads me to believe that
a more cost-effective sex doll, one with some basic moving parts,
could become as popular as....blow-up dolls. Unless you made this
things fashionable, they would remain the realm of pervos and
fetishists.

<p>
The most interesting possibility on this list, in my opinion, is that
of duel-feature domestic bot/love droid, but we all know robots aren't
gonna be around until Spacely Sprockets finally gets off the ground.
So, my final estimate is that mass-appeal sexbots are a foolish topic.
Fetishists will always pay ridiculous sums for ridiculous stuff, but
no fetishite trend has ever been mainstream enough to deserve serious
attention.

<p>
But then again I have a bias against bot-talk, because anything that
needs that much maintenance isn't feasible enough to really discuss.
Anyway, hope that was informative.
