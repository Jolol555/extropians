A nice idea, but it usually doesn't work. I'm on several of those
daugther lists, and none of those have ever had any (serious)
activity, i.e. they're dead. How's the NodeNet thing doing? My
guess is not too well.</a> 

<p>
<a name="2527qlink1">On a more general note: the main ExI list has had the good fortune 
<a name="2540qlink1">of being very active (which is quite rare), and IMO any fancy 
software schemes of attempts to devide it into specialized lists 
would only hurt it, or even kill it. Most people like it plain and 
simple: one list, free for all with little or no rules.</a> Of course,
judging from previous debates on this issue, nothing will probably 
happen anyway, so there's no need to worry ;-)
