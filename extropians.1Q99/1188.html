<p>
Yes.  These areas could eventually lead to real memetic engineering.  The
thing that is lacking now is predictability - 90% of everything is based on
personal opinion, hunches, and guesswork.  In principle it ought to be
possible to put the field on a firmer footing than</a> that.

<p>
The subject deserves a lot more attention than it gets.  Of course, I'm not
sure how you would perform an experiment...</a>

<p>

<p>
Hmmm.  Not exactly.

<p>
The simple-minded view says 'intelligence is completely general, so an SI
can do anything with ease'.  I don't subscribe to that.  The opposite
informed view says 'intelligence is a composite of many different factors,
which are mostly unrelated, so the SI will still be bad at some things'.  I
don't buy that either.

<p>
<a name="1215qlink3">This is a very long discussion to get into.  I'm writing up a full
explanation of my current theories about it at the moment - would you be
interested in a copy?</a>
