<p>
I suggest you actually read what I write before you start quoting your
NRA propoganda.  You have pointed out a half dozen problems with my line
of reasoning, but none of your points match what I really said.  You are
arguing with what you expected me to say, or you are quoting your
arguments from some source that was not written specifically to address
my posting.

<p>
I said I see this in my own area and that's what I meant.  I didn't take
this from major media.  I said toddler based on your limit of children
&lt;9 years old, and that's what I meant.  I didn't use someone else's
definition of "child" or assume that the word "child" meant under 9.  I
said kids playing with guns and that's what I meant.  I am not talking
about drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes.  I said accidental shooting,
and that's what I meant.  I'm not including deliberate shootings in my
numbers.  I said two or three per year and that's what I meant.  I'm not
allowing the media to hype one or two cases total into a frenzy.

<p>
Please pay attention.  I am not saying that I have statistics to counter
your statistics.  I am saying that in my community I have seen dozens of
accidental shooting deaths of kids under 9.  I probably have lived
through more than 31 such occurances, and therefore cannot believe your
claim that only 31 children under the age of 9 have been accidentally
killed by firearms in the last 35 years for the entire U.S.  Please
provide evidence for this claim or withdraw it.  And please read my
posts carefully before attacking statements I never made.
