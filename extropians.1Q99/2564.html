Jack Vance, in a SF novel (either THE DRAGONMASTERS or THE LAST CASTLE, I forget which) treated the topic of genetic warfare, where each race (there were two very dissimilar ones) created troops designed to serve different war functions from the DNA of their POWs; thus engineered race A soldiers were fighting for race B against soldiers of race B engineered by race A.  The irony is that the side with the most flexible genome lost, because it was turned against them.
