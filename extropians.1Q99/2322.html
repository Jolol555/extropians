<p>
Speak for yourself.<a name="2424qlink2">  Only I decide what is "bad" for me.</a> Blashemphy?  Who is

believe any insights I gain in this type of work as TRUE, nor do I run around and
proselytize those beliefs to others.  Therefore if there is a danger, it is only a
self-inflicted one upon myself.  In the spirit of transhumanist<a name="2424qlink5"> self-responsibility,

it is my own risk to take.

<a href="2313.html#2322qlink2">&gt; &gt;Internally believing in anything "as if</a><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; belief consistently in the context of all of our knowledge and does it</i><br>
<i>&gt; maximize the rate of knowledge acrual? History has given us repeated</i><br>
<i>&gt; demonstrations that it effectively minimizes progress.</i><br>

<p>
Again my friend, you are confusing internal and experiential states of mind with
social reality.  The costs are mine and mine alone to assess.<a name="2424qlink6">  Whether I can hold
any particular and transitory belief consistent with my other knowledge is my
decision to make and no one else's. Who are you to decide my own internal states are
<a name="2424qlink7">good or bad?</a>  Doesn't that put in you the category of thought police?
