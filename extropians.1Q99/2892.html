Hi,

<p>
I found a review of this book in rec.arts.sf.reviews: "Beggars In Spain". I
know  it used to be available via Laissez Faire Books, so it might have some
libertarian leanings. From the reader's summary, the theme seems to deal with
posthumanism- in this case, the creation by genetic engineering of a race of
sleepless beings with all the time in the world to improve themselves.

Beggars in Spain by Nancy Kress
<p>
	Review Copyright 1999 Mariann T. Woodward

<p>
What would you do if you never needed to sleep?  If you never got tired?
How many of us say, when overwhelmed with life and its activities, "If
only I had an extra so-many hours...?"  For Leisha Camden, the question
begets an obvious answer: Apply oneself to become the best and brightest
in everything.

<p>
Such is the premise of Nancy Kress' novel, BEGGARS IN SPAIN.  In this
imaginary world, genetic manipulation has spawned considerable interest in
creating the perfect child.  From physical characteristics such as hair
and eye color to mental characteristics such as intelligence or giftedness
in a particular academic area, expectant parents pay for a custom-made
child.  One such family, the Camdens, opt to pursue a secretive, highly
experimental and ethically debated characteristic for their unborn
daughter: sleeplessness.  The goal, as Roger sees it, it to produce a
perfect individual with literally all the time in the world to read,
write, study, learn, and apply herself to be the best she can be.

<p>
Leisha is the result of her father's determination and her mother's
reluctance, but so is her fraternal twin, another girl.  Alice is not a
sleepless like her sister; she is a normal, reasonably healthy child, yet
she struggles for her family's acceptance.  As their mother grows
increasingly unstable, the twins quickly learn that only Leisha is deemed
special in their father's eyes.  Despite Leisha's assertions that her
sister could and would be just as special, but in a different way, Alice
is, after all, just a sleeper.  In Leisha's light, Alice simply fades away
into darkness.

<p>
As childhood disappears and Leisha becomes an adult with numerous
dysfunctional relationships with friends, lovers, and family, so begins
the trouble for other people like her in Kress' world.  Normal people are,
of course, threatened by the sleepless and their abilities.  By not having
to sleep eight to ten hours a day, the sleepless use the extra time to
study and practice until they perfect and master a skill or lesson.  As
Leisha moves further into adulthood, segregation and restrictions become
prevalent as protest groups form to tear down the sleepless' dominance.
The sleepless retreat into their own world, first on private property,
then orbiting the planet on a space station.  What began as a parent's
desire to see a child have all that is possible becomes, quite simply, a
war between the haves and the have-nots.  The beggars.
