Title
<br>
  Effect of dietary curcumin and dibenzoylmethane on formation
  of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced mammary tumors and
  lymphomas/leukemias in Sencar mice.

Abstract
<br>
  Female Sencar mice (6 weeks old) were administered 1 mg of
  7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) by oral gavage once a week for 5 weeks.
  At 20 weeks after the first dose of DMBA, 68% of mice developed mammary
  tumors (the average 1.08 tumors per mouse) and 45% had lymphomas/leukemias.
  Feeding 1% dibenzoylmethane (DBM) in AIN 76A diet, starting
  at 2 weeks before the first dose of DMBA and continuing until the end of the
  experiment, inhibited both the multiplicity and incidence of DMBA-induced
  mammary tumor by 97%. The incidence of lymphomas/leukemias was completely
  inhibited by 1% DBM diet. In contrast, feeding 2% curcumin diet had little or
  no effect on the incidence of mammary tumors, and the incidence of
  lymphomas/leukemias was reduced by 53%.

  Effect of the beta-diketones diferuloylmethane (curcumin) and
  dibenzoylmethane on rat mammary DNA adducts and tumors

Abstract
<br>
  Curcumin is a beta-diketone constituent of the spice turmeric that possesses
  anticarcinogenic properties in several animal models. The present studies
  were conducted in order to identify beta-diketones structurally-related to
  curcumin that would be effective dietary blocking agents toward the
  initiation stage of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced rat mammary
  carcinogenesis. Of the beta-diketone compounds initially screened for their
  capacity to induce quinone-reductase (QR) activity in wild-type Hepa1c1c7
  cells and a mutant subclone, curcumin (diferuloylmethane) and
  dibenzoylmethane were most effective. However, when added to
  semipurified diets fed to female rats, dibenzoylmethane
<br>
  (1%), but not curcumin (1%), was effective in inhibiting in vivo mammary<br>
  DMBA-DNA adduct formation. This inhibitory effect on mammary adduct formation
  was associated with a significant increase in liver activities of glutathione
  S-transferase, QR and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activities. Female rats
  provided diets supplemented with dibenzoylmethane at 0.1,
  0.5 and 1.0% for 14 days prior to dosing with DMBA exhibited a significant
  decrease in mammary tumor development, compared with controls. However, tumor
  development for animals fed diets containing 1.0% curcumin was not different
  from that of controls. Therefore, dibenzoylmethane, and
  possibly other structurally-related beta-diketones, warrant examination as
  breast cancer chemopreventative blocking agents.

  7 years experience of photopatch testing with sunscreen allergens in Sweden.

  Contact Dermatitis.  38(2):61-4, 1998 Feb.
Abstract
<br>
  Since 1990 7 sunscreen allergens have been included in the standard
  photopatch protocol at 2 Swedish dermatology clinics. 355 consecutive
  patients with suspected photosensitivity were tested, and in 28 of these
<br>
  (7.9%), a total of 42 allergic reactions were found. 80% of the reactions<br>
  were of photocontact origin. The most common allergen was benzophenone-3
<br>
  (Eusolex 4360), with 15 photocontact and 1 contact allergic reactions,<br>
  followed by isopropyl dibenzoylmethane (Eusolex 8020) (8
  photocontact, 4 contact) and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane
<br>
  (Parsol 1789), with 6 photocontact reactions. There were 2 cases of<br>
  photocontact allergy to phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid (Eusolex 232),
  which has not been reported previously. 1 case of contact urticaria from
  benzophenone-3 was accidentally found. In addition, 21 + reactions of
  doubtful relevance were noted in 14 patients: 16 on irradiated and 5 on
  non-irradiated test sites. Among these, irritant and phototoxic reactions may
  be included. These results indicate that the inclusion of UV filters in the
  standard photopatch protocol is important. Immediate-type testing for
  urticaria could also be of value.
