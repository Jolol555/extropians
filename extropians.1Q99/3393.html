It's getting unpleasantly close to April 1, making me begin to mistrust
every surprising result announced for the next few weeks.  Just the other
day a magazine reported that PC's constantly saved the noises picked up
by their microphones and the resulting files could be queried remotely
(that's why your disk drive light flashes occasionally, you see).  This
was a joke but it went around for a while before everyone realized it.

<p>
I wish this stupid custom would go away.  It's<a name="3446qlink1"> getting to the point where
there needs to be a moratorium on discoveries for a month starting in
</a>
mid March.

<p>
I tried to make some variation of "april fool" by anagramming "dr philippa
uwins".  I got "april" and was worried, but the closest I could come to
was something like "april pun hid wisp" which doesn't seem too close.
So I guess we can count this one as legit.
