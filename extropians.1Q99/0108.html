Taking current knowledge conventional theory in biology and cosmology as
starting points:


<OL>
  <li>  Chemical-based life can't evolve until you have enough supernovae to
produce planets with a decent abundance of heavy elements.  That means no
life until maybe 5 -6  billion years ago, right?

  <li>  Life appears easily, but it takes billions of years to get beyond the
microbe stage.  Worlds with a 5-6 billion year history and no multicellular
life could easily be the norm.

<a name="0113qlink1">  <li>  We have no basis for determining how fast evolution occurred on Earth vs.
other worlds - there are pretty good arguments for the view that we live in
a very accelerated environment that would be very rare.</a>

  <li>  If light speed limits are real, all we are really assuming is that we are
not in the light cone of another Singularity.  Given the above points, that
is only a few hundred million light years - a small fraction of the
universe.
