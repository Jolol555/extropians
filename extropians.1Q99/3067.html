When human determine whether X "is" flawless they compare X against a model
which they have declared lacks flaws.  This method requires consensus.

BB need not value the goals of minor sentiences as important as its own.

Considering the malleability of the human mind, BB would have no problem to
control the humans by means of a thought police to do its bidding, if it so
felt inclined.

<p>
I apply a non-zero probablity to such a possibility.

<a href="2903.html#3067qlink5">|3)  When you speak of nonhuman/inhuman Powers, do you mean, "not of human</a><br>

<a href="2903.html#3067qlink6">|seems to me that if an alien Power developed from social antecedants, then it</a><br>

<i>|interpreted the same way.  I think that there are certain strategies of</i><br>

<i>|though us puny humans might be stretching the limits of its imagination, it</i><br>
<i>|might just be able to recognize us as kindred in a sense.</i><br>

<p>
The human history contains a number of terminal elimination of peoples, groups
and "lower" life forms.  If the Power descended from humans ancestry, then it
might consider the elimination of some or all humans for some rational reason.

Count the number of cultures which have survived the contact with a highly
advanced technological culture.  Your culture could became a ``cargo cult''.

Fairness is only relevant among equals.

The altruistic superior entity might not think your wishes relevant.

The cat might not appreciate the fairness of the neutering.
