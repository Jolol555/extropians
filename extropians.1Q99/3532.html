<a name="3539qlink1">I am not sure how long an anarchy could survive while surrounded by

less viable.  The State is strongest at low technology, even if that same
technology does not allow it to grow to huge sizes, but there seems to 
me to be a very limited window of technology that allows large, pervasive
State.  With nanotechnology, we will have reached the point where the
citizen doesn't need a State at all, and can escape its influence with 
relative ease.

I expect, unfortunately, that we are in for a very bad time, then, as
all sorts of minted weapons of mass destruction are thrown around by
people who are living thousands of times too close to each other for
peace.
