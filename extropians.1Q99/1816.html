<a name="1817qlink2">To accept any limit simply because we don't know of a way around it, entirely
circumvents the tranhumanist spirit of inquiry and exploration.</a>  I will
acknowledge at this time I know of no way to destroy matter other than its
transformation into energy (E=mc^2).  But to say I currently don't *know* of a
way to create matter, is a long way from stating it cannot be done.  Since you
haven't experimented an infinite number of times and tried an infinite number
of variations of experiments in an attempt to create matter, you really can't
say it cannot be done.  You have no clue whether it can be done or not.
Saying otherwise puts you into the same class of absolute TRUTH contingents as
any religious fundamentalist.

<p>
Defending the spirit of J. Eric Mortensen's post - saying something *may*
happen is a far cry from saying something *will* happen.  I think anyone who
has seriously delved into artificial life experiments, quantum cosmology,
black holes, bubbling and basement universes created via traversible
wormholes, in a spirit of whimsy perhaps, has entertained the notion that our
universe may have been created by entities from a previous ancestral
universe.  However, I think it's more fun to entertain the notion of myself
creating new universes.  I don't know about you, but I do planning on being a
'god' myself,  not to be worshipped, but to have fun creating new things -
even new universes if such a thing were to ever become possible.
