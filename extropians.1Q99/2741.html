<a href="2704.html#2741qlink2">&gt; &gt;Cryonics is never mentioned with regard to Quarles, so I suppose</a><br>

Yep, this isn't the first time that I've suggested some prodding, but
since Quarles still seems to underestimate his need for cryonics
(I can't imagine that such a public supporter of immortality would
be secretive about his suspension contract), maybe it's time for
another try.
