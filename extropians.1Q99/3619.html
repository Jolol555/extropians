Exactly.

<a name="3814qlink4"><a name="3626qlink1">I think a lot of the discussions about the emergence of Powers and SI
are hampered by a lack of what Lyle Burkhead</a> call 'callibration' - are
these ideas really checked against reality? Technological development
does not necessarily jump, there are always economics involved, humans
often act together in a social manner, if somebody has
technology/knowledge X then it is very likely that many has it or are
close to it too, Hollywood memes are not necesarily true and so on. I
think I need to write something like www.geniebusters.org for
uploading and the brain</a> :-)
