I believe current wormhole theory allows the following method of time
travel:


<OL>
  <li>  Create a wormhole in your lab, spanning some short distance.  Call its
two ends openings A and B.  If you step into opening A ten minutes after the
wormhole is opened, you emerge from opening B ten minutes after the
wormholes was opened (i.e. at the same time).

  <li>  Put opening B on a spacecraft, and accelerate it to near the speed of
light.  Let it coast in that frame of reference for awhile, so that you
build up an age difference between the two ends of the wormhole.

  <li>  Bring opening B back to your lab, and put it next to opening A again.
Let's say that opening A is ten years old at this point, but opening B has
only experienced 8 years of time passage due to relativistic effects.  This
means that if you step into A, you will not emerge from B for 2 years.
Likewise, if you step into B you emerge from A two years in the past.


</OL>
<p>
The obvious consequence is that a wormhole allows for time travel, but only
through the span of time in which the wormhole exists.  So if you create
one, you are issuing an open-ended invitation for visitors from the future.

<p>
I'll be very interested to see if this actually works in practice.
