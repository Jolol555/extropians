Be careful about saying things like that, my ego may grow so much that
fusion processes start in the core :-)

<p>
<a name="0830qlink1">It is a bit ironic that borganisms are so often suggested, since they
appear to be harder to implement than individuals. In very complex
individual the concept of self will likely be rather complex (in some
sense we are borganisms already, collective minds made up of
semi-independent brain systems), but connecting minds evolved to be
individual in an useful way is likely rather complex; it is likely
easier to extend them instead.</a>

<p>
<a name="0854qlink1">I agree that we need some different scenarios to look at. There were a
few scenarios mentioned in the technology thread a few weeks back
based on the relative arrival of AI, nanotech and hardware; while they
just ended up in the big Singularity discussion, I think the approach
is good. We could list the potential technologies and methods
available, figure out an approximative dependency tree (i.e. "If we
have reliable nanotech, massively parallel CA-style computers become
easy and cheap") and discuss the consequences. Most likely this can
get extremely complex, so we should either try to run it as a scenario
planning project or find some useful hypertext/critlink model to keep
track of all the links.</a>
