<a name="2682qlink1">Third way is the term coined (I believe) by Tony Blair to describe his "New
Labour" Labour party. Not conservative, not left wing - a new, third, way.</a>

<p>
This term gained support from the important "early-adopter" and opinion
leader segment who are attracted by a shiny new phrase. It is also used to
describe the recently elected socialist government of Germany along with
other new-left European Governments.

<p>
Defining it is hard as it is a moving target. It essentially means not
nationalizing industry, getting slightly sane about local council schooling
policies, but also enacting and enforcing a social-contract where we are all
required to behave decently and in society's best interests. Those interests
are variously defined but increasingly appear to mean a vision of society as
defined by what in Britain is called the Blue Stocking brigade: kindly,
conservative, bleeding hearts who believe in pro-active state intervention.
<a name="2682qlink2">My Blair is a religious man and part of the motivating sentiment of the
third way is that we are our brothers keepers.</a>
