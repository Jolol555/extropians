<a href="1665.html#1667qlink2">&gt; giving product away for free obviously means they are dumping product on the</a><br>

After examining the site, I've changed my mind. The advertising is installed as part
of the explorer interface on win98, so the user is exposed to the ads the entire time
they use the computer. I wouldn't doubt that this is highly valuable advertising
space. I think he might do well by this. Being bombarded by the ads every minuteyou
use the computer has got to be worth a LOT, especially since people are stuck in
front of these things for so long. Its like locking someone in the bathroom with ONE
magazine that has the same ads on every page.......gotta have a significant impact on
their buying habits.
