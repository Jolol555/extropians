<p>
The difference between these cases is simply one of degree.  Parents can
provide a large fraction of a child's information about the world, and have
the opportunity to persuade the child to adopt their viewpoint before
his/her mind develops the memetic immune system of an adult.  As you point
out, this process is both necessary and inevitable.

<p>
What the FAQ appears to propose is that we hard-wire a predetermined moral
system into these posthuman beings, and compel them to abide by it for the
</a>
rest of eternity.  There is no parallel for this in human society, because
it is not yet possible to do such a thing.

<p>
Here is a comparable case:

<p>
<a name="2236qlink1">Suppose my parents are religious, and they feel that anyone who is not a
member of their faith will suffer eternal damnation.  Consequently, at an
early age they have be fitted with neural implants that will ensure I
fervently believe in their faith, that I will never violate its tenets, and
that I am incapable of ever changing this belief system.</a>

<p>
This is not teaching, or persuasion, or passing on an opinion.  It is
outright mind control.  I don't see that doing the same thing to a sentient
AI would be any different.

<p>
<a href="2229.html#2234qlink3">&gt; Two points: First, a being who has a certain fundamental value</a><br>
<i>&gt; *doesn't want to change it*, per definition. So it's not as if these</i><br>
<i>&gt; guys will think they are being mind-fucked and try to figure out a</i><br>
<i>&gt; way to get around it. No more than you are trying to abolish your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; survival instinct just because you know that it is an artifact of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary past..</i><br>

<p>
We could have a long argument about this issue, and I suspect its all been
said before.  I'd be happy to go another round if you're interested, but my
main concern here is the moral issue.
