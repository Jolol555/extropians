<a name="0853qlink1"><a name="0802qlink1">The old golden rule was fine, the only issue is a semantic one.</a>  This "new"
rule loses its bang because it ignores the relationship between you and your
</a>
fellow man.<a name="0853qlink2">  Arguably, this "projective" capacity is the foundation of the
rule to begin with.  The idea, as expressed by modern cog sci scholars,</a> goes
<a name="0853qlink3">something like this:  We developed the ability to hold a model of the world
around us in our heads to make decisions, and as a byproduct of this
"projective" ability, we learned to project, or model, our own</a> experience of
<a name="0853qlink4">humanity to other humans...i.e. creating a model of what its like to be us
and projecting it on them.

<p>
Forget multiculturalism, thats just a small example of the differences that
arise between our subjective, lonely, isolated minds.  Even people</a> who share
<a name="0853qlink5">a similar cultural heritage have differing wants and needs, so different in
fact, that we cannot begin to second guess their desires.  Descarte
understood this when he articulated the golden rule as he did...

<p>
Do unto others _just as_ you would have them do unto you.  The statement is
intended more to express the ideal relationship between individuals than to
dictate specific behaviors.  It can be processed on many levels.  i.e.  "I
will give you, Mr. Pacifist, a punch in the face because I would have you
punch me, Mr. Masochist, in the face."  but by that same token, "I will not
do to you, Mr. Pacifist, what you do not want me, Mr. Masochist, to do to
you, because I would not do to you, what I would not want you to do to me."

<p>
The golden rule should be seen to operate on this second, "higher level"...
Maybe somebody out there could better express what I'm trying to get</a> at with
this.

<i>&gt;</i><br>
