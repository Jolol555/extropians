<a href="0571.html#0591qlink1">&gt; Here's an example of technology advance directed against</a><br>
<i>&gt; the interests of the people. The government is planning </i><br>
<i>&gt; to develop a genetically engineered strain of fungus</i><br>
<i>&gt; that will destroy one of the most medically active,</i><br>
<i>&gt; safe, and useful plants known to man: cannabis.</i><br>

<p>
How strange, surely the politicians and their servants don't
*really* want to wipe out this very lucrative trade, which finances 
many of their activities and provides lots of people with jobs?
Oh wait, must be a plot to blow the prices trough the roof after
stockpiling the stuff. Not bad! Demand stays the same (or
goes up ) while scarcity increases: more violence, worse quality,
more deaths, more policing and stricter punishments, more
power to the government. Hum ho.
 
<p>
<a href="0571.html#0591qlink2">&gt; The problem of course is not tech-</a><br>
<i>&gt; nology per se but governmental power and the inability</i><br>
<i>&gt; to restrain it or hold it accountable for its actions.</i><br>
