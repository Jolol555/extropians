<a href="0411.html#0439qlink1">&gt;It will be interesting to see if, in our desperation to fill every</a><br>
<i>&gt;natural niche, we use our technology to develop humans that</i><br>
<i>&gt;photosynthesize. If so, I imagine that as more of the population</i><br>
<i>&gt;shifts to such a lifestyle, there will be increasing calls to</i><br>
<i>&gt;outlaw the eating of plants by vegans, they will argue that</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is immoral to prey upon innocent plants (who can feel pain, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;even current science has shown, are territorial, and defend</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves with poisons, both as irritants and toxic pesticides)</i><br>
<i>&gt;with arguments like: "This type of predation is so foreign to me</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I am deeply saddened by this type of activity and</i><br>
<i>&gt;represents a sub-human psychology in killing life just for fun."</i><br>

<p>
I'm reminded of a story  Ted Nugent like's to tell:

<p>
Ted and the members of Damm Yankee's were staying at Ted's place in
central Michigan. Ted invited the boy's to go out hunting with him.

<p>
Tommy Shaw gently pointed out to Ted that he was a vegetarian...

<p>
"Hey no problem Tommy !!" replies Ted "We'll just go out back and
whack some cabbages !!!" (makes bow drawing motion) "Quick, get it
before it jumps!! "

<p>
Actually I like the symbiosis idea....economical, efficient.

<p>
"If God didn't want us eating animals, why did he make them out of
meat...."   anonymous 5 year old.
