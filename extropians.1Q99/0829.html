<p>
How does this do more than protect your investment in the shares?  That's
already at risk in the current system, since your equity can be wiped out if
the corporation does something really stupid.  Without limited liability,
ownership of corporate shares would expose my entire net worth.  Or am I
missing something?</a>

<p>

<p>
I can't speak for most people, but I know it FEELS different to me to invest
in a general partnership, where I know I have unlimited personal liability</a> . .

<a href="0343.html#0829qlink3">&gt;   If you look carefully enough, you will see that current law assigns more</a><br>
<i>&gt;  liability than most people assume. For example, if a company that pays out</i><br>
a
<br>
<a href="0343.html#0829qlink4">&gt;  dividend which later turns out to cause it to default on a debt, </a><br>
<i>&gt; shareholders</i><br>
<i>&gt;  can be liable (I suspect up to the amount of the dividend). Also, when the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Bank of United States collapsed in 1930, shareholders were asked to pay</i><br>
<i>&gt;  some money to help pay off depositors (I'm not sure if this was justified</i><br>
<i>&gt;  by dividends that had been paid to shareholders, and at any rate few</i><br>
<i>&gt;  shareholders paid other than those who were depositors and had it deducted</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from their deposits.)</i><br>

This is true, and I noted it in my initial post in this thread, but it's VERY
rare in terms of real public companies.  It is much more common in private,
closely-held corporations: In my practice, I check into the assets of the
principle stockholders of such companies as a standard procedure in the course
of litigation, since there's a real risk of such companies being plundered in
anticipation of an adverse judgment.
