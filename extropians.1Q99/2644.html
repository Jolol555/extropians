That was what I claimed, however I don't have any cites at hand for that, though
I had just been talking about the source with a buddy who owns a gun store about
an hour before I posted that. It was obviously hearsay. I can say for a fact
that the national board which posts the accident rates for all activities did
post the accident rate for firearms, and even the overall rate for accidental
death from firearms is lower than the rates for private aviation, and about the
same level as commercial aviation. Commercial aviation, is in fact only
surpassed in terms of safety in the transportation sector by one other means:
elevators. Firearms should be the last thing that cities should be filing
lawsuits over. The accidental death rate from automobiles, for example, is
shockingly high, even today.<a name="2729qlink1"> There are still around 30,000 people killed on the
roads in the US each year.</a> And don't get me started about bathroom fixtures. Did
you know that the bathroom is the room a person is most likely to die in???
Slippery bathroom tiles are a public threat and should be banned like assault
weapons. They should build toilets so that nobody has to burn more than two
calories or raise their blood pressure more than 5 points to drop a load...;)

<p>
I have not had a chance to talk with my buddy for several days, but I will try
to reaffirm what his source was on that stat.
