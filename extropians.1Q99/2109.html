 Exchange rate risks stop many risk-averse people. Without being able to
predict exchange rates, you can't know whether a 5% return in U.S. dollars
is better than a 1% return in Yen. Governments probably intervene in the
currency markets at random to discourage the average person from engaging
in this kind of arbitrage.
<br>
 Also, it's harder for someone who doesn't understand English to evaluate
U.S. investments.

 I don't know what's been outlawed, but Japanese have purchased enough
t-bonds that people often worry about the effects on the U.S. economy
if they suddenly sold them all.
