Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), low B-vitamin intake,
  and genetic polymorphisms related to tHcy metabolism may play roles in
  coronary heart disease
<br>
  (CHD). More prospective studies are needed. METHODS AND<br>
  RESULTS: We used a prospective case-cohort design to
  determine whether tHcy-related factors are associated with incidence of CHD
  over an average of 3.3 years of follow-up in a biracial sample of middle-aged
  men and women. Age-, race-, and field center-adjusted CHD incidence was
  associated positively (P&lt;0.05) with tHcy in women but not men, and CHD was
  associated negatively (P&lt;0.05) with plasma folate (women only), plasma
  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (both sexes), and vitamin supplementation (women
  only). However, after accounting for other risk factors, only plasma
  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was associated with CHD incidence; the relative risk
  for the highest versus lowest quintile of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was 0.28
<br>
  (95% CI=0.1 to 0.7). There was no association of CHD with the C677T mutation<br>
  of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene or with 3 mutations of the
  cystathionine beta-synthase gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our
  prospective findings add uncertainty to conclusions derived
  mostly from cross-sectional studies that tHcy is a major, independent,
  causative risk factor for CHD. Our findings point more strongly to the
  possibility that vitamin B6 offers independent protection. Randomized trials,
  some of which are under way, are needed to better clarify the
  interrelationships of tHcy, B vitamins, and cardiovascular
  disease.
