<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe that this networked community will, in time, include other</i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligences on other planets.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I believe that this massively interacting network will learn all about</i><br>

totally
<br>
<a href="2269.html#2297qlink4">&gt;control the physical universe.  At this point it/they is/are God.  Sort of</a><br>

<p>
:D

<p>
<a href="2269.html#2297qlink5">&gt;Having control of time means that God is operating now and was operating in</a><br>
<i>&gt;the past, therefore we can gain knowledge of God by studying the nature of</i><br>
the
<br>
<a href="2269.html#2297qlink6">&gt;universe.  This study I say is worship, and is the only worship God expects.</a><br>
<i>&gt;He most certainly doesn't expect us to prostrate ourselves at his feet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In fact. I believe God expects us to join the community of gods that is God,</i><br>
<i>&gt;when we're good enough, when we deserve it.  Frank Tipler tells us how we can</i><br>
<i>&gt;all be brought back to life in the massive computers of the future.  I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;think the Omega Point is integral to this theory, so it doesn't matter if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Universe will crunch or not.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I have founded The Church of the Modern Era (you can find it on the AOL</i><br>
<i>&gt;Alternate Religions board 2 and Anders Sandberg's Posthuman sub page)</i><br>
where we
<br>
<a href="2269.html#2297qlink7">&gt;are developing a morality, ethics and religious principles to live by and</a><br>
<i>&gt;prepare our species for the future.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;God is our descendent and his nature is an extension of ours.  We must be</i><br>

I see.  I was using the usual meaning of the term 'God.'  You were using,
well, the Q Continuum.  Gotcha.  Thanks.
