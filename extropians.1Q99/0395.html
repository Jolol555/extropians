To have rights, a being must understand the concept of rights, communicate its
understanding to others, and hopefully take action based on that understanding
to protect those rights. If any being cannot do these then it is just meat. That
being said, other beings must be able to understand what is being communicated.
Our own developing ability to understand the more primitive forms of
communication of other species (and some which may or may not be more complex
than our own) is only a few decades old, so it is logical to leave a bit of room
at the upper end of the brain mass / body mass scale free from predation just to
be safe.
