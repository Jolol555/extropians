Not at all!  The point others have been trying to make is that outlawing
abortion is legislating morality, irrespective of the *actual* morality,
and thus against the Extropian Principles.  My point is that there
exists a plausible position stating that abortion is not "immoral", it
is "violating the right to life of another sentient", and thus
prohibited by the Extropian Principles.

<a name="3304qlink2">Since no additional definition is provided to the fundamental questions
of abortion by the Extropian axioms, and since the Extropians themselves
are divided, it is erroneous to state that Extropians are for, or
against, abortion - which is a statement I've seen, both on this list,
and in articles about Extropians.

<a name="3304qlink3">Is abortion controversial?  Yes, but it's a controversy it well
deserves!  The stakes are either millions of innocent lives or the
freedom of millions of innocent women.  And, if the Extropian Principles
had some bearing on it, we shouldn't hesitate to say so, just as we
don't hesitate to make controversial statements about the utility of
cryonics or intelligence enhancement.  But they don't, and we shouldn't
embroil Extropians qua Extropians in the conflict.
