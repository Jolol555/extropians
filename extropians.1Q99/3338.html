<a href="0550.html#3338qlink1">&gt; From: Scott Badger &lt;wbadger@psyberlink.net&gt;</a><br>

<p>
<a href="3320.html#3338qlink2">&gt; I would like to thank all those who responded to the recent discussion</a><br>
<i>&gt; regarding the reasonableness of endorsing the idea of cryonics.  Clearly the</i><br>
<i>&gt; majority of the respondents are pro-cryonics and believe it to be entirely</i><br>
<i>&gt; congruent with Extropian principles.</i><br>

<p>
Not only that, but IMHO being signed up is a "must" for any
serious transhumanist/extropian. It shows that one doesn't just
pay lip service to the philosophy, but "puts one's money where
one's mouth is". A sign of commitment. Not just to transhumanism,
but to reason and life itself. The only valid excuse I can think of
[for not signing up] is being too poor to afford it (note that some
of the cheapest suspensions come at approx. $15K).
 
<p>
<a href="3320.html#3338qlink3">&gt; It sounded to me as if several of those who responded are already signed up.</a><br>
<i>&gt; That's great.  Though I've been an advocate for a bit over a year now, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; just now in the process of actually signing up.  For me, the procrastination</i><br>
<i>&gt; was more of a financial issue than anthing else.  But I've been wondering</i><br>
<i>&gt; how many among us are currently signed up.  </i><br>

<p>
Yes, so do I (and probably lots of others). How about a poll?

<p>
<i>&gt; If I recall correctly, one of</i><br>
<a href="3320.html#3338qlink4">&gt; the webpages at ExI was dedicated to what one could do that would be</a><br>
<i>&gt; extropic (top ten things to do?) and one of those things was to arrange for</i><br>
<i>&gt; one's cryonic suspension.</i><br>

<p>
Perhaps you mean "Five Things You Can Do To Fight Entropy Now"
by Romana Machado (there's an "enhanced" copy at
<a href="http://members.wbs.net/homepages/c/r/y/cryonic4life/5things.htm">http://members.wbs.net/homepages/c/r/y/cryonic4life/5things.htm</a>)
An excellent essay indeed.
