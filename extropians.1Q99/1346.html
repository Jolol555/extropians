After carrying a PalmPilot around for a year and a half, I can attest to this. As a text
searchable notepad alone it's
<br>
like having a third layer of 
<br>
memory.

<p>
Short term: 7-9 items/concepts/symbols. Duration approx 20 minutes. Very rapid, reliable access. Speed of recall: &lt;0.1 seconds.

<p>
Long term: multiple giga-giga bytes, including linked streams [music], images, models, and isolated facts. Duration: varies with amount of recall, up to 80 years. Reliability of recall varies with amount of recall. Speed of recall: 0.1-10 seconds.

<p>
PDA memory: 2 megabytes of text, including email
 ,notes, databases, addresses, minus space for applications. Duration: Forever, with appropriate maintenance [changing batteries, backups]. Reliability of recall invariant with amount of recall. Speed of recall: 15-45 seconds.

<p>
And that's just as a memory aid. This doesn't even mention
the benefits of carrying a clock, calculator, and programmable computer around.

<p>
I'm almost ashamed to say that I feel almost naked if I leave the house without it. Almost like [a small taste] of what a human SI with neural implants would feel if their implants failed.
