<a name="2168qlink1">I think you're misinterpreting the analogy.</a>  The DNA is not the actual

<p>
The accurate analogy would be that we could produce a blueprint for
an intelligent machine with current technology.  Actually making
the object the blueprint describes, however, is a different problem.
If we can't test the blueprint, of course, we will be hard-pressed
to decide whether the blueprint we make is valid.

<a name="2168qlink3">Incidentally, about 50% of our DNA is involved</a> with the brain, so
10% may be low.  Naturally shifting from 30 megs to 150 megs makes
no qualitative difference to your argument.
