about 4 years ago when the web was newer, i tried a little experiment.
i found a website for multilevel marketing schemes.  my experiment
was to visit 20 of the sites and let them set all the cookies
they wanted. (i was at the workplace.)  furthermore, i gave them my
email address and indicated my interest..  i wanted to see if i would
get 20 emails or if they would proliferate my address.  they proliferated
it wildly.  i began to get hundreds of messages a day, most of it
unrelated
<br>
to what i expressed interest in.  i suspected this might happen.  i
changed my email address. {8^D

<p>
now i get spamvertisements that have a line at the bottom saying: "if
you want no further contact, click remove below".  i have been afraid
to touch that link, for fear that my address would end up on a cd
of spammers greatest hits.
