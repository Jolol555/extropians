<a href="2562.html#2569qlink1">&gt; It appears as if ASpidle complained to Tim:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; |Whoa there Tim. There isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; |enough time since the beginning of the Universe to get from blue green algae</i><br>
<i>&gt; |to amoebas, much less to people if natural selection from random mutations is</i><br>
<i>&gt; |the only mechanism.</i><br>

<p>
This is a common claim, that random evolution won't produce complex
organisms very fast.  It seems like a million monkeys typing on
keyboards which will never turn out the works of Shakespear.  Most
people don't realize how easily things can get organized at the
molecular level.

<p>
One example I like to cite is crystal growth.  Image a lot of little
crystal cubes bouncing around in a liquid solution.  The randomly
bounce, they randomly stick together, they randomly break apart.  What
are the chances that they will grow a large cubic crystal structure
instead of a random shaped lump?  Very high.  It actually is
statistically more likely to result in a large cubic structure than any
random shape.

<p>
Why?  If two cubes touch corners, they are only stuck together at one
point.  A small amount of vibration will knock them loose.  If two cubes
touch edges, they are stuck together along an entire line.  It takes
more force to knock them loose.  If two cubes touch sides, they are
stuck together by whatever area overlap.  The more area that overlaps,
the more force it takes to break them apart.  Here's the clencher:  The
strongest bond possible, and the most overlap possible, is when the
cubes are perfectly aligned, and their square sides are 100% in line
with the cube next to them.  Cubes that are out of line or rotated at a
different angle than the cubes next to them cannot achieve a 100% bond.

<p>
When these cubes bounce around, they randomly touch, stick, vibrate, and
unstick.  The closer the cubes line up perfectly, the stronger the bond
is, and the less likely they are to come unstuck.  Cubes that are lined
up tend to stay lined up.  Cubes that are out of line tend to become
unstuck and bounce around.

<p>
Statistically speaking, these cubes are more likely to line up in rows
and columns, than in random piles.  They are more likely to form larger
cubic structures than any other shape.  The bottom line is, they aren't
randomly thrown together.  The laws of the universe promote order and
regularity.  Given random evolution, little cubic crystals will evolve
into larger and more complex cubic structures.  This is like water
flowing down hill.  It's not a miraculous inexplicable event.  It is the
nature result of random evolution, which prefers organization over
chaos.
