<a name="3061qlink1">I'm SORRY I can't give you a source other than the discovery channel, but
from what I had seen on that show the major evedience for global warming
was a 1 degree F increase in the world's total average temperature.Anyone
seen anything like this?</a>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="3029.html#3035qlink2">&gt; I think you'll find that glaciers in the northern hemisphere are</a><br>
receding,
<br>
<a href="3029.html#3035qlink3">&gt; and glaciers in the southern hemisphere are growing. I don't have a cite,</a><br>
<i>&gt; but that's certainly true of the only glaciers I've visited (in New</i><br>
Zealand
<br>
<a href="3029.html#3035qlink4">&gt; and the Canadian Rockies); AFAIR the New Zealand glaciers were receding</a><br>
<i>&gt; until the middle of this century and have been growing again since then.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;This corresponds to my experience.  It seems to have been getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;hotter and hotter.  Every year for the past few years has seemed to set</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;new records.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; However, that depends on what your definition of "seems" is. My</i><br>
experience
<br>
<a href="3029.html#3035qlink5">&gt; has been the opposite; I haven't seen a summer worthy of the name since I</a><br>
<i>&gt; came back to England two years ago, and nothing that even begins to</i><br>
compare
<br>
<a href="3029.html#3035qlink6">&gt; to the super-hot summers of the seventies. </a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd be interested to see an independent study of recent temperatures; all</i><br>
<i>&gt; that I've seen implies that the pro-greenhouse folks declare each year to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be warmer than ever before even when they're not. In fact they seem to</i><br>
<i>&gt; declare any kind of weather as proof of global warming, whether it's hot,</i><br>
<i>&gt; cold, perfectly clear or a major storm.</i><br>
