What's your ultimate aim.

<p>
Lucky you!  How'd you get there?  What projects?

<p>
<a href="3875.html#3901qlink3">&gt; I wonder:  why do you think it is necessary to pursue your project under</a><br>
<i>&gt; the aegis of Extropianism?</i><br>

<p>
What do you mean by "under the aegis"?

<p>
Using the usual definition - the cause I feel responsible to - I operate
under the aegis of Externalism.  (No, I am not going to define it one
more damn time - if you want to know, I think there's something in
_Coding_.)  Anything else, including the Singularity, is a means to an end.

<p>
&gt; -- or Singularitarianism, which sounds even<br>
&gt; more cultish?<br>

<p>
Heh.  Do you suppose I haven't been trying to think of a less awkward phrase?

<p>
But I don't even label my project Extropy - I disagree with the
Practical Optimism principle - although I do suppose that the project is
about ultratechnology, so it is Extropianist, and it is certainly Singularitarian.

<p>
<a href="3875.html#3901qlink4">&gt; There is another meme that *is* about making money, and</a><br>
<i>&gt; that meme plays a more fundamental role in your life than Extropianism.</i><br>

<p>
Greed?  Survival?  Hedonism?

<p>
<a href="3875.html#3901qlink5">&gt; Maybe a simple reframe is all you need.  Your project could be conceived</a><br>
<i>&gt; in a different context, described in different terms, and carried out</i><br>
<i>&gt; under a different aegis.  As I said in one of my last posts before</i><br>
<i>&gt; dropping off the list two years ago, Extropianism is just a watered down</i><br>
<i>&gt; version of the ur-meme.  Why not go back to the real thing?  Your own</i><br>
<i>&gt; people will give you all the money you need, if you explain what you</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to do in terms that make sense to them.  That would be one way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; set events in motion.</i><br>

<p>
Yeah?  What is this ur-meme, and how would I need to rephrase the
Elisson Project before someone (say, you) would start writing checks?
