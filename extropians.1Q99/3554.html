How about a *functional* or *realistic* optimist? An individual who 
expects the best, and if neccessary, makes it happen themselves. 

<p>
I find it odd that optimism and joyful enthusiasm don't seem to be in 
style. The media (and therefore society at large) seem to find more 
interest in negativity and angst. I don't see why we can't start a trend 
toward happiness. The self-help bookshelf is full of "talk yourself into 
a happy life" selections, yet the bestselling albums are either dark and 
violent, or sad "bring back my love" themes. The question of "why we are 
here on this particular planet" is a bit much for a wednesday, but I 
assure you, it's not so that we can mope around.

<p>
And I think that global happiness would occur a lot more quickly if 
MST3K were available in Canada. We have to rent the few available 
episodes on video. 

<p>
Happy Day!
