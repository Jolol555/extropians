<a href="2614.html#2624qlink1">&gt; Actually, I think that it has been established that the earliest</a><br>

Sounds quite close to sports psychology - visualization and simulation

<a href="2614.html#2624qlink2">&gt; I have similar theories about agriculture religions evolving from the</a><br>
<i>&gt; sky watchers who told people when it was time to plant, when it was time</i><br>
<i>&gt; to harvest, and when it was time to store food.  Those that obeyed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; astrologers did better than those who did not listen to their</i><br>
<i>&gt; predictions.</i><br>

As far as I know, farmers tend to know that quite well without having
to be told. But maybe this was a practical way of centralizing the
meteorological tasks.
