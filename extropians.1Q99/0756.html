Their abstract reads: 

<p>
  We discuss the Carter's formula about the mankind evolution 
   probability following the derivation proposed by Barrow
  and Tipler. We stress the relation between the existence of 
  billions of galaxies and the evolution of at least one 
  intelligent life, whose living time is not trivial, all over 
  the Universe. We show that the existence probability and the 
  lifetime of a civilization depend not only on the evolutionary 
  critical steps, but also on the number of places where the 
  life can arise. In the light of these results, we propose a 
  stronger version of Anthropic Principle. 


<p>
I finally looked this paper over carefully, and I think they 
misinterpret their main result.  Their main result is equation 
15 on page 7, which they interpret as showing "that the 
expected living time of a civilization increases with the 
number of earth-like planets in the Universe."  They contrast 
this with the suprisingly short living time obtained in 
Carter's original calculation.  What Feoli &amp; Rampone actually
calculate, however, is the expected *maximum* living time 
among all the planets.

<p>
Carter got his result by conditioning on a planet having
reached the civilization level sometime during the planet's 
fixed time window of t0.  Feoli &amp; Rampone, in contrast, 
condition on at least one of N planets achieving civilization 
during its t0 window.  

<p>
Equation 9 gives the probability P'(t) (for t in [0,t0]) that 
at least one of the N planets will have reached civilization 
level by the time that planet is t old.  This can be thought
of as a CDF over the PDF describing the actual time when the
earliest planet reaches civilization level.   

<p>
Equation 10 differentiates this CDF, obtaining the PDF, and
takes the expectation of this PDF.  Equation 10 is then 
reworked to obtain equation 15, which is the main result.
Thus the main result is just the expected time duration after
civilization arrives on the *earliest* planet on which 
civilization arrives.  

<p>
This time obviously should increase as N increases.  However,
unless we have some reason for believing that we are the earliest
planet (relative to when our planet formed), this should give
us no comfort about the expected time our planet will remain
viable.  If there is a conflict between Carter's result and 
observations about our planet, Feoli &amp; Rampone do not help us 
resolve it.
