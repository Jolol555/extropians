<i>&gt; to purchase.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The saved money will then suffer tremendous inflation (more money than </i><br>
<i>&gt; goods = higher prices for goods). No use trying to buy American or </i><br>
<i>&gt; Australian goods (2 countries for whom the age bulge will hit around 15 </i><br>

brought it up...

<a name="2109qlink1"><a name="2049qlink1">I do not understand why Japanese savers do not invest more of their money
outside of Japan</a> (in the US or Europe for example). First of all it would
earn a lot more interest. It would help the countries they invest in. It
would also stimulate demand for Japanese exports, thus helping their own
economy. And finally it would solve the problem of their savings not being
worth anything when they retire.

<p>
It just seems like a win-win solution, yet it is not adopted nor even
promoted. Why?
