<a href="1796.html#1868qlink1">&gt;Now we're talking.  What is everyone actually doing?</a><br>

<p>
Personally I aim to have everything I need to survive a month in reasonable
comfort without spending much on items which won't be useful if life 
continues as normal on Jan 1st. That covers pretty much everything except 
power generation, and I can manage for some time with just my car battery, 
an invertor and a full tank of gas. By doing that I'm relatively safe for a 
while if things go bad, and lose little if they don't. If food supplies
are disrupted for a month or more, then the world will be a completely
different place anyway.

<p>
Also if things are looking bad I'll have my rent paid up three months
in advance (so my landlord won't kick me out and will have cash on hand to
stock up on food too, rather than come looking for mine), and then just have 
to decide what to do about money and investments. I'll certainly have 
enough cash, etc, stored away to cover a month's expenses, and I'll see 
about the rest later this year.

<p>
I'm guessing that will cost me about $1000 in lost interest, buying
non-essential items, etc, but I'll end up with about $800 of gadgets
which will be useful in the future, whatever happens. That seems a small 
price to pay to ensure some degree of security; since I already live in a 
rural area I don't have to do anything really expensive like move house.
