<i>&gt; &gt; I've got a great wearable already that works for self defense. Its made</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; by Sturm, Ruger, &amp; Co. It provides the ultimate in security interaction,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 10 rounds of pure 9 mm protection.... he he.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Personally I'd choose FN's Five-seveN; 20+1 rounds of Kevlar-</i><br>
<i>&gt; busting ammo. Of course I'd have it customized with a smooth</i><br>
<i>&gt; trigger, laser sight (touch trigger to activate) and a small</i><br>
<i>&gt; flashlight (or perhaps a miniature, automtatic camera to capture</i><br>
<i>&gt; those special moments on film ;-) Now *that's* a wearable!</i><br>

<p>
Thats a sweet little death ray! I've been thinking about going to something
like that, since I've been hearing about cops that are selling surplus body
armor that the police no longer use because its beyond its use date to gang
bangers in the hood. It would definitely be nice to have some AP capability
for such situations... of course, I'm torn as to whether to get my own armor
too.

<p>
<a href="1462.html#1463qlink2">&gt; Ps: I suppose you still have that silly law in the US which only</a><br>
<i>&gt; allows a handgun to hold 10 rounds? No such thing over here,</i><br>
<i>&gt; heh heh...</i><br>

<p>
Actually, it bans the manufacture of new magazines of more than 10 rounds.
There are plenty of magazines sold out there that were manufactured before the
law took effect that have more than 10 rounds, and its perfectly legal to own
them and use them. The only magazine limit on use is that you can't have more
than 5 rounds in your magazine when hunting deer or other animals...except
humans...

<p>
My next big purchase is a FFL so I can buy the good stuff....
