psychiatry = get an MD from a med school of your choice.
cog sci  =get an undergrad psych qual and then seek out a good grad 
school, which you will be well aware of having gotten the undergrad 
degree.

<p>
Empirically, this is not the case. It is not intelligence that is making 
you and your friends depressed.

SSRIs work well ;-) So does  behavior therapy. About the same efficacy 
but Prozac is usually cheaper.

<p>
It may have come about because you are in a lower social status position 
than your ability suits you for. That is one evolutionary reason for the 
depressive response and one very good reason for not getting any 
"treatment" unless the depression makes you dysfunctional. At low levels, 
it drives ambition which you need to make it.
