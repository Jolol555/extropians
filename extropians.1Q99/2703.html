Might it be more statistically sound to compare the ratios deaths/guns,
deaths/cars, deaths/bathrooms, deaths/pools?

<a name="2814qlink1">It seems to me that there are certainly a LOT more cars and bathrooms than
there are guns.</a> Also, consider the amount of time people spend in these
places with the time they spend handling firearms.<a name="2814qlink2"> I refuse to believe that
a bathroom is more dangerous than a gun, which is what you seem</a> to be
suggesting.
