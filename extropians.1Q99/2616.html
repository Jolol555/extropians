By the tone of your comments, implying that EvMick must be listening to
lying right-wing radio if he didn't hear enough stories about kids getting
shot to back up the anti-gun propaganda?</a>

<p>
Yet when an anti-gun argument is made with plain old lies, the mass media
continue to lap it all up; the gun argument is less about facts and reality
than preconceived ideas.

<a name="2628qlink2">Your figures, incidentally, had one year when 34 kids under 5 were 
accidentally shot and killed; I couldn't tell from Mike's message whether
he meant 31 in 35 years (obviously silly) or 31 per year... if the latter
then he's pretty much in agreement with the other source.</a>

<p>
No, I said that only the anti-gun hordes would care about a few kids getting
shot when there are so many other ways that kids die all the time. Their
priority is clearly banning guns, not saving kids.
