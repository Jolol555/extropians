I would live in:  The Archive.

<p>
( Zone Barrier #4 on the canonical list in _Singularity Analysis_:<br>
  <a href="http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/sing_analysis.html#zones">http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/sing_analysis.html#zones</a> )

<p>
Let's say that there's a full-scale Singularity and that we all have the
opportunity to go for all-out godhood.  If there's an infinite supply of
computing power and memory, the old personality might be archived. 
Various levels of our own selves might be "archived" as continuing,
active programs - ranging from our current selves, to the highest level
of intelligence attainable without complete inscrutability.  Hundreds,
even millions, of versions might wander off into strange realms of
cognitive self-alteration, but the "you" who first greeted the Final
Dawn would always be around as a backup.  What would there be to do? 
Perhaps any number of meaningful things; not as meaningful as the
Powers' playrooms, but meaning is meaning.

<p>
Life is good and there are gods to talk to.
