<p>
Since humans and transhumans consider ourselves the more advanced of the
species, and the question of "rights" which we, as a species, understand
the meaning and consequences of, animals are not privy to this question and
cannot openly debate their rights.

<p>
So, I think your question is one of our *ethics* and *conscience of
actions* in giving consideration and respect to animals outside our species.  

<p>
Since most humans and transhumans have pets living with them, (we may own
legally and are responsible for them, but we don't own our pets as
"objects" like living room chairs), it our ethical choice to give our pets
respect and consideration for their well being.

<p>
<a name="0438qlink1"><a name="0367qlink1">We now can afford to be vegetarian, and the foods produced these days for
vegetarians are substantial and contain the necessary nutrients, we no
longer need to hunt and kill animals for food.  Regardless of meat eaters
excuses that there are farms that breed animals for food and that is their
purpose and justify this as necessary for human nutrition, I have
difficulty in understanding the defense.  The cow has nerve endings and
feels pain.  The cow also reproduces and cares for its young.  The look of
horror on the cows face when it is sent to the slaughter house is a vision
I try not to draw up from my memory bank.</a>

<p>
The sport of killing animals for fun, not for food, does still occur and is
legal, unless the animals is a protected species.  This type of sport is so
foreign to me that I am deeply saddened by this type of activity and
represents a sub-human psychology in killing life just for fun.</a>

<p>
Thus, to answer your question, I believe that animals are not cognizant of
rights.  They are aware of their well being because of their heightened
senses and they themselves have innate boundaries for their own survival.
Pets are under the owner's protection and he or she is the guardian of the
animal.  The human and transhuman have an ethical responsibility to
consider what the animal needs and to provide it as best she/he can.  There
is indeed a sliding scale based of how humans and transhumans view animals
which is a hierarchy (based on such things as: intelligence, cuteness,
sensuality, strength, or storybook characteristics)  imposed on them by us
and also by nature.
