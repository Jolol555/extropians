<a href="2444.html#2617qlink1"> &gt; It seems to me that biology researchers (like my son) have extrapolated the</a><br>

 I wonder over this view, Kauffman seems to share it with you. It is so
 different from my view: we are unique, contingent! If the universe was
 re-run again, nothing like us would ever appear. We have been
 selected, not randomly but with the help of randomness. There is
 nothing gruesome with that. &gt;&gt;

Thanks Anders, I totally agree with you.  It's the sense that we are lucky
junk (a direct quotation) that I think is gruesome.  I love your expression
that we are unique and contingent.

<a name="2759qlink2">While my son (PhD in molecular biology) introduced me to Kaufmann and seems to
think his work is very important, he is still stuck in the "lucky junk"
paradigm.  It's the characterization, not the science that I have trouble
with.  The emotional vehemence and intollerence of other interpretations that
he shares with so many others on this list (not you Anders) upsets me.
