  IAN: Zappa's 3-CD set "Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar" 
  and a more recent 2-CD compilation "Frank Zappa
  Guitar" are perhaps the most spectacular and 
  unworldly guitar I have ever heard! This is
  music beyond the realm played with a skill 
  to match. Beyond the foul-mouth garbage
  that exists in so much of his work is 
  a musical genius from another dimension!
  Those CDs will give you the real Zappa. I 
  once posited that there must be some realm 
  in the universe (or elsewhere!) where Zappa's 
  guitar spontaneously occurs, there must be!!! :)
