It's probably easiest for me to respond to this.  I did some supplemental
calculations on new year's eve after returning from the party.

<p>
The correlation between the responses to Question # 7:

<p>
(How much do you believe it costs to have your body cryonically preserved?)

<p>
and Question # 44:

<p>
(I believe that Cryonics is an exciting idea and intend on looking into it
further.)

<p>
is:        -.0030      N=507      p = .946

<p>
The overall correlation between the two sets of responses are therefore
statistically non-significant.

<p>
So I decided to form two groups, (1) those who estimated costs to be less
than $500,000, and (2) those who estimated costs to be $500,000 or more.
There were 422 participants in Group 1 and 85 in Group 2.  A simple ANOVA
sought differences between the groups in terms of their responses to Q44.
The result was an F ration of 1.6  and an F prob. of .205.  Again, nothing
really there to distinguish between the groups suggesting that cost is not a
large factor.

<p>
This conclusion appears counter-intuitive, but appears nonetheless.  It may
be that I overstated the importance of costs in my summary.  I was simply a
bit taken aback by how high many of the estimates were.  Then again, there
were a number of very low estimates so, as Robin stated, the median fell
into a fairly realistic range.
