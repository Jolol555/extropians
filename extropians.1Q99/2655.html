Only when the lie is sold for actual value, guarranteed as good. If its free
information, well, you get what you pay for.

The point of the crowded theater anecdote is that you have a large number of
people crowded in a small space. They are obviously infringing on each others
personal space, and the exit pathways and doorways are obviously inadequate to
deal with a panicked mob, so by entering the theater, you enter into an implied
contract to constrain your behavior to that fitting such a crowded space. I
don't just apply it to speech. Anyone who farts in a crowded theater should be
roasted over hot coals, an inch at a time.

<p>
<a href="2654.html#2655qlink3">&gt; I agree with Larry Flynt that the community has no right to dictate</a><br>
<i>&gt; standards about speech of any form.</i><br>

<p>
Not when it comes to products sold in private businesses or used in the privacy
of one's home. In public though? A penthouse playmate walking down the street
buff in a retirement community is likely to become a homicide offense..
