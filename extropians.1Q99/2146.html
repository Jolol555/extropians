<a href="2145.html#2146qlink1">&gt; &gt;imagine a fighter jet flying upside down straight</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;and level at high speed.  pilot pulls back on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;stick, jet accelerates downward at several g's.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   IAN: But your jet still has thrust...</i><br>

<p>
well, it is not necessarily under thrust but it would need
forward velocity.  partially agreed.  {8-]

<p>
<a href="2145.html#2146qlink2">&gt; FL800 in the CIA video shows each engine flame out just before</a><br>
<i>&gt;   it reaches the peak of it's rocket-like climb,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   so we're talking about a fall without thrust</i><br>
<i>&gt;   and almost no initial horizontal velocity.</i><br>

<p>
i admit i have not studied the cia version of the fl800 story.  the
details of what happened after the explosion have never interested
me much because there must be a great deal of guesswork.

<p>
<a name="2179qlink1">but when the thing first happened, i thought i recall the investigators
proposing an explosion that originated *inside* the fuel tank.
</a>
<a name="2179qlink2">this i found most improbable, even if an ignition source were to
be found.  i think it was mike lorrey who described patching leaky fuel
</a>
tanks in aircraft with gum.  {8^D  that makes me howl just thinking
about it.  that would suggest an ignition *outside* the tank
which presents a whole nuther set of questions.  either way ian,
i am partially with you in that i think the official version
underexplains
<br>
<a name="2179qlink3">the explosion.  im not too concerned about the 29 second plunge tho.
i figure they estimated here, guessed a little there.  ive seen plenty
</a>
of
<br>
reports like that.  either way, it does little to improve the morale of
of one like me who flies on the durn things a lot.  {8-[  spike
