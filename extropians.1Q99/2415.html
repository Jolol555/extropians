We shouldn't argue about God (or lack thereof).

<p>
Discuss?  Speculate?  Theorize?  Debate?  Fall Asleep?

<p>
Any and all of the above are more than OK, but we should be careful of arguing
and fighting over these matters.  And why is it that any mention of
religiously related matters seems to fan the flame of conflict?

<p>
I would suggest that when we bring up religion in any form, we are activating
some rather deeply embedded and baroque meme complexes which have strong and
myriad associational links, many of them capable of triggering powerful
emotions.  Thus we should be cautious, and utilize some of the best social
tools available, such as tolerance, courtesy, and empathy to prevent a meme
complex triggered emotional avalanche.  Now, another option would be to simply
avoid the subject all together as too dangerous...never liked this approach,
too restrictive.  Besides which, I would suggest there might be some good
memes entangled in all those religious meme complexes; it would be a shame if
we were to throw the meme out with the meme complex.
