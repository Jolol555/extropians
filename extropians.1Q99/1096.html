Communist and Nazi government also had a lot of professional, hard-working,
and honest (though misguided) workers that kept those countries strong
for awhile.  So did ancient Egypt and China that withstood much longer
tests of time.

I would like to see more from the country leadership.  They should be
honest as an entity, actively promote liberty, have grand-scale
understanding of the forthcoming cultural, economic, and technological
issues and problems, and guide the society through them.  
Instead they are clueless, drag their feet when the reality stares them 
in the face, and almost always make decisions that are detrimental for
liberty and growth, pursuing instead interests of entrenched power
structures.   I would say this is fortunate that they do it all with
horrifying inefficiency that would drive any private company bankrupt
in no time.  If the government could be more efficient, it would have
taken over everything - as it did in the above mentioned countries
where it was - relatively - more efficient.
