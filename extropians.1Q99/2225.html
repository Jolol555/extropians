<a name="2266qlink2"><a name="2264qlink2">Yes. This is rather a mindset that is partially forced onto us by our
culture (all those "things man was never meant to know" memes) and
partially due to bad thinking habits (if you think that being
intelligent means being a Leonardo or Aristoi all the day, and then
realize you are intelligent and not behaving like that, you might
think there is something wrong</a> with you).

I like cognitive therapy. Therapy in various forms has the advantage
that it works even when a drug would be unavailable, since it helps
set up a cognitive "immune defense" against negative thinking
patterns. Medication is more useful for breaking the initial vicious
circle and show the possibility for change.
