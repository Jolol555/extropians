Ha, thats funny. Say I'm a criminal holding you up. Since I have</a> a silencer on

<a name="0654qlink4">and nobody heard a thing, so I'm obviously not phased by your yap</a> about 'the

<p>
If I were trying to kill you, I obviously don't regard killing as a morally
unacceptable act, so what are you gonna do now?

<a href="0629.html#0643qlink3">&gt; My main defense would be to live in a country where it is difficult to get</a><br>

<i>&gt; psychopaths, secret service agents, etc)</i><br>

away with killing someone who you have no significant prior contact with, have
no aversion to completely destroying all evidence, and prepare ahead of time,
and I sincerely doubt that the Scottish authorities are any more technologically
advanced in forensics than the FBI is.

<p>

<a href="0629.html#0643qlink4">&gt; &gt;If it's all subjective, surely you grant that I have as good a claim to</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;kill you as you have not to be killed. No?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Claim?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;The point is that the only alternative to objectivity is arbitrariness,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;which appears to culminate in den Otter's regime of might-makes-right. Is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;this really your vision of human society?</i><br>

Please stop contradicting yourself, in concurrent sentences, no less.</a>

<p>
<a href="0629.html#0643qlink5">&gt; Or otherwsie persuaded not go around smighting things</a><br>
<i>&gt; (economic sanctions, long term gains, etc.)  Nowadays the government tends</i><br>
<i>&gt; to be the mightiest things around - more soldiers than any provate citizen</i><br>
<i>&gt; has, nmore nukes, etc.  But the government has to pretend to be acting in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the best interests of democracy (and occasionaly might be, you never know),</i><br>
<i>&gt; so if enough citizens get upset enough, it has to change it's mind.  It's</i><br>
<i>&gt; still dead handy for providing police forces as the biggest smiter around,</i><br>
<i>&gt; to stop smaller smighters smighting the smallest of them.  &lt;althogether too</i><br>
<i>&gt; much smighting in that paragraph, methinks&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Terms such as "valid" (in an ethical context) and "rightful" are simply</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;shorthand ways of expressing the idea that social conduct is not an</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;arbitrary matter, like aesthetic tastes. They don't necessarily imply a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;code imposed "from above" as in traditional moral codes.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0654qlink7"><i>&gt; Social conduct isn't arbitrary.  Certain actions are sociable and certain</i><br>
<i>&gt; aren't.  But some actions are anti-social and this</a> is perfectly reasonable</i><br>
<a name="0654qlink8"><i>&gt; (some libertarians/anarchists don't even believe in society, so they can</i><br>
<i>&gt; hardly be expected to follow social conventions, can they?).</i><br>
</a>
<p>
Who decides?

<p>
<a name="0654qlink9"><a href="0629.html#0643qlink6">&gt; Social rules are usually fairly simple - don't lie, don't attack</a> each other,</a><br>
<a name="0654qlink10"><i>&gt; etc.  But they are no use when the person you are dealing</a> with is antisocial</i><br>
<a name="0654qlink11"><i>&gt; and ignores the conventions you expect them to.</i><br>

<p>
Of course. Its extremely rude of me to carry a concealed firearm which</a> you never
<a name="0654qlink12">know about until the moment you decide to rip me off. Of course, since</a> you are
<a name="0654qlink13">only redistributing wealth which I obviously did not earn (because in your
opinion it is too much money), then your behavior is socially</a> acceptable while
mine is not.
