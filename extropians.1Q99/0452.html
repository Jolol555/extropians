I think this is a good argument.  All else equal, it is better for there
to be more living organisms enjoying life.

<p>
However, some food animals do not have lives as good as range-fed cows.
Animal rights activists describe chickens raised their whole lives in
wire cages barely big enough to turn around in, veal calves kept chained
in stalls and force-fed, and other hardships designed to increase the
amount of salable meat.

<p>
Robin's argument calls attention to the quality of life of the animals
being raised for meat, an important issue which is often glossed over
in debates about vegetarianism.  We should not be looking so much at
the question of whether we kill and eat animals, but rather at how we
treat the animals while they are alive.

<p>
BTW I visited a beef processing plant many years ago, to get some cow
lungs which would be used for dissection in my wife's biology class,
and the treatment of the animals struck me as being very humane.  The
cows were killed instantly and, as nearly as I could judge, painlessly;
the animal's body is then swept away and not seen by the other cows.
