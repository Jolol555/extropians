<a name="2859qlink1">Because you originally started this discussion claiming that 'toddlers'
regularly shot each other. Toddlers are under age five, unless something
has changed dramatically with US parenting recently.</a>

<a href="2628.html#2811qlink2">&gt;not the 34 you are quoting.</a><br>

<p>
Only if you keep changing your definition of 'kids'. Mike was responding
to the 'toddler' post, not a post about people under fifteen.

<a name="2859qlink3">BTW, he also made a good point about suicides being regularly listed as
accidental deaths; this is also a reason for these studies showing that
cops are regularly killed with their own guns... a very large fraction of
cop deaths are suicides... for which they use their own guns.
