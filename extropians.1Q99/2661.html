&gt; I have been thinking of running some program through the list archives
&gt; to do data mining, for example build sociograms (who responds to
&gt; whom?), find threads where someone participates, who glorifies who and
&gt; perhaps extract clusters of discussion. Maybe the way of improving
&gt; quality of the list lies in making archives more powerful?

</pre>
<p>
Certainly. The archive server could then add simply meta-tag information to
mails based on some kind of discriminant function analysis, or a weighting
on 5-6 neural net vectors.

<p>
clients could then run private scripts like this simple example (in
Applescript 'cause I am a Mac head)

<p>
property myWeightings:{0.5,0.1,-0.7,0.9,0.01,}

<p>
set thisMailsWeights to (extract meta weights(mail_headers)) as list

<p>
set myRanking to 0
<br>
set n to 1
<br>
repeat with myWeight in myWeightings
<p>
   set myRanking to myWeight * item n of thisMailsWeights
   set n to n + 1
<br>
end

<p>
if myRanking is less than 3 then
<p>
   mark the current mail as read
<br>
   set the color of the current mail to "light gray"
end if

<p>
cheers,
