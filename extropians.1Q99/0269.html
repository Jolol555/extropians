<i>&gt; Being an admirer of the late Prof. Einstein, I paid this link a visit,</i><br>
<i>&gt; hoping to find a thoughtful, or at least fresh, perspective by an</i><br>
<i>&gt; incomparable intellect. Alas, I was gravely disappointed. He does little</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than repeat the standard litany of groundless assertions that had</i><br>
<i>&gt; already been discredited when he wrote the piece. The flaws are so</i><br>
<i>&gt; transparent, it's obvious to me that he never gave any real thought to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; All this article proves is that Einstein was no economist, had learned</i><br>
<i>&gt; little from political history, and was uninterested in critically examining</i><br>
<i>&gt; the assumptions he acquired from his upbringing and academic background. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; expected better from such an otherwise brilliant thinker.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As has been pointed out, whatever his stated ethical standards may have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been, he in fact favored institutionalized thuggery.</i><br>

<a name="0288qlink1">Maybe he came to his conclusions because he never really profited from
his grand discoveries, while lesser mortals got rich selling widgets and
hitting home runs. A purely capitalistic economy would have enriched
him. Then he probably would have been a capitalist. The inequality of
the system might have simply pushed him towards socialism. Maybe he
never gave it as much thought as most assume.
