-Anthony Garcia wrote many cogent and cunningly constructed sentences, the
impact of which I will not reduce by partially quoting.

<p>
He ended with:

<p>
<a name="2737qlink1"><a href="2731.html#2735qlink1">&gt; ... voluntarism, even in it's</a><br>
<i>&gt; watered-down form as minarchist libertarianism, is unpopular with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; masses.  They appear to like slavery and socialism and being governed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or at least they don't mind it very much, and they tend to resent</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone who questions their complacency.  And perhaps Max, acting in</i><br>
<i>&gt; his role as "spokesperson for Extropianism" would like to see big-E</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropianism popularized among and adopted by these same masses,</i><br>
<i>&gt; incidentally leading to better chances for speaking gigs and book</i><br>
<i>&gt; deals and talking head TV appearances for himself.  Thus, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; abandonment or at least shoving-aside of inconvenient voluntarism.</i><br>
</a><i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm disgusted.</i><br>

<p>
I agree. The situation is similar to that facing Mahatma Ghandi immediately
prior to British withdrawal and the granting of independence to India.

<p>
Ghandi did not want to accept Independence are argued against signing up to
Lord Mountbatten's Indian Independence Bill? Why, because having come 90% of
the distance he did not want to end up with a crippled prize (a divided
India, which as Ghandi predicted, has been in a constant state of near-war
with its Northern neighbor ever since separation).

<p>
We must hold strong to voluntarism as a primary underpinning of future man,
otherwise he will be a slave.

<a href="2731.html#2735qlink2">&gt; Max More writes:</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     "[The belief that force should not be used except</i><br>
<i>&gt;      in self-defense is] *compatible* with extropianism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;      But it is not *required* by extropianism."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps upon reaching the decrepit old age of 30, my mind is beginning</i><br>
<i>&gt; to fail me.  But I *was* under the impression that "extropianism" was</i><br>
<i>&gt; explicitly voluntarist/an-Archist/anarchocapitalist, completely</i><br>
<i>&gt; rejecting any political/social systems which sanction any type of</i><br>
<i>&gt; initiation of force or other transgression against the individual.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't recall how I formed this apparently incorrect association.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps from reading articles such as "Deep Anarchy", published in</i><br>
<i>&gt; EXTROPY No. 5 nearly a decade ago, where Max wrote:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     "Two of the fundamental extropian values are</i><br>
<i>&gt;     responsibility for one's own life and actions,</i><br>
<i>&gt;     and the determination to do away with</i><br>
<i>&gt;     constraints on one's rational will.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;     believe that the institutions of religion and</i><br>
<i>&gt;     ``the State`` are antithetical to these values."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     "We already live in an anarchy.  There is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;     ``State``.  There are only individuals acting</i><br>
<i>&gt;     in a statist manner..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     "Let us not be deterred from seeking a</i><br>
<i>&gt;     spontaneous voluntarist society by cynics who</i><br>
<i>&gt;     stand for stagnation.  Freedom is our</i><br>
<i>&gt;     evolutionary future."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yet now I see Max stating in his 2/21/99 govt.html:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     "Extropians _generally favor_ market mechanisms...</i><br>
<i>&gt;     Extropians _generally prefer_ market approaches...</i><br>
<i>&gt;     [but] we may differ among ourselves about</i><br>
<i>&gt;     the extent of the proper role of government.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; And just what sorts of roles for government might this</i><br>
<i>&gt; new, improved extropianism support?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     "Some [extropians] may favor government subsidy of basic</i><br>
<i>&gt;     scientific research, or certain regulations [to</i><br>
<i>&gt;     maintain] a maximally open society, or the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     provision of services they think will be poorly</i><br>
<i>&gt;     provided without state intervention."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Oh, really now?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Exactly how long has this congenial attitude towards the State been a</i><br>
<i>&gt; part of the accepted definition of "extropian"?  In other words,</i><br>
<i>&gt; exactly at what point within the last 7 or 8 years did I unknowingly</i><br>
<i>&gt; cease to be an extropian?  I suppose I have to seek the company of</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Voluntarist Transhumanists" now that Max has seen fit to extend his</i><br>
<i>&gt; definition of "extropianism" to include sanction of the extortionist</i><br>
<i>&gt; practices of nation-state criminal gangs?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; My fault for not paying attention, of course.  I've been ignoring the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropy Institute for some time now, basically ever since EXTROPY</i><br>
<i>&gt; ceased publication.  I didn't particularly dig the shallow fluffiness</i><br>
<i>&gt; creeping in towards the end.  I've been busy with other things going</i><br>
<i>&gt; on in my life, and haven't had time to closely follow the Extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; mailing list or make frequent visits to infrequently updated websites.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I've been receiving and archiving the mailing list, and only glancing</i><br>
<i>&gt; into my archives on rare occasions.  Nonetheless, during all this</i><br>
<i>&gt; time, I've continued to consider myself "extropian".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I suppose my big mistake was failing to pay attention when EP 3.0 was</i><br>
<i>&gt; released.  I now go check it out and find that the principle of</i><br>
<i>&gt; valuing "Spontaneous Order" has spontaneously mutated itself into</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Open Society" and "Self-Direction".  Not quite the same thing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Yes, Citizen-unit", {thump baton into open palm}, "you can have all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Open Society and criticism you want.  Just as long as you keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; directing yourself to make those tax payments on time."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I *was* under the impression that, with "extropianism", I had found</i><br>
<i>&gt; the company of like-minded voluntarist transhumanists.  But now Max</i><br>
<i>&gt; has apparently expanded the "tent" to include the potentially larger</i><br>
<i>&gt; set of non-voluntarist transhumanists.  And in doing so, he has</i><br>
<i>&gt; transformed the place where voluntarist transhumans stand under this</i><br>
<i>&gt; tent.  We once could roam the entire floor; now we are shunted off to</i><br>
<i>&gt; a small corner where we can be safely ignored:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;     "_Some_ [extropians] would like to experiment with</i><br>
<i>&gt;     entirely novel [voluntarist] social orders..."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Wow.  Smooth.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I can see why Max might want to do this: voluntarism, even in it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; watered-down form as minarchist libertarianism, is unpopular with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; masses.  They appear to like slavery and socialism and being governed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Or at least they don't mind it very much, and they tend to resent</i><br>
<i>&gt; anyone who questions their complacency.  And perhaps Max, acting in</i><br>
<i>&gt; his role as "spokesperson for Extropianism" would like to see big-E</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropianism popularised among and adopted by these same masses,</i><br>
<i>&gt; incidentally leading to better chances for speaking gigs and book</i><br>
<i>&gt; deals and talking head TV appearances for himself.  Thus, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; abandonment or at least shoving-aside of inconvenient voluntarism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm disgusted.</i><br>
