<a name="0954qlink1">I think this would be an interesting exercise. It might be a good idea
to have someone knowledgeable in technological history look into the
design to make it reasonable.

<p>
As I see it, we want nodes and links between them, both able to be
commented (first a general description like "Simple nanotechnology:
the ability to mechanosynthetize some molecular structures using
special tools in a controlled environment", or "Simple nanotech leads
to advanced nanotech given enough interest and investments", then
comments and discussions about the details). Ideally it should be
clear what nodes and links are regarded as likely (lots of supporting
analysis: lots of small green markers), what is regarded as unlikely
(red markers) and controversial (many markers of different colors). 

<p>
I wish I could devote more time to something like this, but I have a
scarce supply of that precious commodity. However, I really wish to
see this implemented and hope to participate in the debate.</a>
