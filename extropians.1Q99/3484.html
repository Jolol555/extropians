Friends,
<p>
<a name="3518qlink1"><a name="3513qlink1">	I'm cross-posting this to the cryonet and extropians list.

<p>
	I've been thinking lately about brain damage.  When exactly</a> is identity
<a name="3514qlink2"><a name="3513qlink2">destroyed?  I mean really obliterated?
<p>
	Specifically, I'm wondering about the difference between loss of
information, and loss of ACCESS TO information.  This last</a> attributed to
</a>
</a>
<a name="3514qlink3"><a name="3513qlink3">the loss of higher-order function.
<p>
	When a brain is damaged--I'm thinking here of strokes,</a> traumatic injury,
</a>
<a name="3514qlink4"><a name="3513qlink4">brain tumors, and  alzheimer's--certain structural changes take place.
Think of the spatial distribution of the damage.
<p>
	Some of those changes presumably involve actual cell death.  But</a> how many
</a>
<a name="3514qlink5"><a name="3513qlink5">cells die, what fraction of the whole is that, how is the damage
distributed regionally/topologically, and what happens to the dead cell
bodies? (I assume fully necrotic cells undergo apoptosis and "digest"
themselves, the by-products being dispersed for either local or distant
consumption or disposal.)  What of "scar tissue" and other structural
remnants?
<p>
	 Then too, what degree of brain damage is characterized by cell damage
without cell death--membrane or cytoskeletal damage/alteration;</a> organelle
</a>
<a name="3514qlink6"><a name="3513qlink6">damage/reduced function--such that the cell still lives, but</a> is not capable
</a>
<a name="3514qlink7"><a name="3513qlink7">of supporting the coordinated global activity characteristic of normal
brain function?(Does this happen, or am I describing a non-fact?</a>   I recall
</a>
<a name="3514qlink8"><a name="3513qlink8">that mitochondria sometimes suffer gradual degradation from,</a> at least,
inherited defect.)
<p>
	When a person is brain dead, is there actually a great lump of dead tissue
</a>
<a name="3514qlink9">inside the skull (I don't think so), or does the absence of brain
waves--the flatline on the electroencephalograph that provokes the term
"persistant vegetative state"--only suffice to imply loss of global
function, but not large-scale cell death, maybe not even small-</a>scale cell
<a name="3514qlink10">death,  or (here's the crux)maybe not nearly as much information</a> loss as
<a name="3514qlink11">we're inclined to think? 
<p>
	 To what extent is the topology of damage responsible</a> for disruptions of
<a name="3514qlink12">neuronal firing patterns?  Could the loss of memory or personality</a> be due
<a name="3514qlink13">not to the loss of the information, but to the inability</a> of the organ to
<a name="3514qlink14">fire that pattern, due to a disrupted firing path.  Would</a> the accumulation
<a name="3514qlink15">of many small areas of damage, such as in the case of alzheimer's,</a> so "damp
<a name="3514qlink16">out" the spatially dynamic, electrochemical resonance of thought--</a>of memory
<a name="3514qlink17">and personality EXPRESSION--that the person seems to fade away?  In a
man-made electronic system, a simple broken wire can result</a> in a complete
<a name="3514qlink18">system failure even though the actual structural deficit may be only an
infinitesimally small fraction of all the atoms of the system, and the
information deficit zero. 
<p>
	Are dementia et al victims really as far gone as we fear they</a> are when we
<a name="3514qlink19">view with dismay their varying degrees of vegetative-ness?  Or is the
information there, but just not expressible? 
<p>
	Identity survival is central to cryonics.  Some aspects</a> of the (gradual)
<a name="3514qlink20">process of identity deterioration provoke an interpretation</a> of irreversible
<a name="3514qlink21">loss.  We look at them and say "They're gone."  How valid is this?  How
subject to reevaluation?
<p>
	One final detail.  I'm a strong believer in the "elegant design" of
natural systems.  "Nature" squeezes as many uses out of any system
component as she can. (Please excuse the teleological</a> and anthropomorphic
<a name="3514qlink22">modes of expression.)  Thus a local brain region with a specialized
function is likely to have multiple roles.  In larger scale global
function--like memory or personality pattern storage and expression--</a>it may
<a name="3514qlink23">have a supporting but not a critical role.  Thus limited local</a> damage which
<a name="3514qlink24">may cause striking loss of specific function may, as regards memory or
personality, have only a mild impact.  In fact, let me repeat what</a> has been
<a name="3514qlink25">suggested before: that memory and personality may</a> be broadly distributed
<a name="3514qlink26">across the cortex and cerebellum (and elswhere?), that such distributed
expression is arguably inherently robust, and that these</a> features strongly
<a name="3514qlink27">suggest the importance of memory and personality to the individual</a> and the
<a name="3514qlink28">species (not to mention to cryonicists and extropians).

<p>
	In the process of writing this, I produced a typo: memeory, instead of
memory.  Hmmmmmm.
<p>
