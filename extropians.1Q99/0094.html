Abstract
<br>
  Recent studies have suggested that weight
  loss in middle-aged persons antecedes increased mortality.
  Therefore, the authors sought to examine the association between changes in
  body weight and subsequent mortality, according to
  self-reported dieting status. The authors followed 9,228 men aged 40-65 years
  in 1963, for whom weight changes between 1963 and 1968 were
  recorded and extensive clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, and dietary
  assessments were made. Of these men, 2,471 reported being on a diet when
  first examined in 1963, and 636 were dieting primarily to lose
  weight. Mortality follow-up covered an 18-year period
  (1968-1986). Men who lost 5 kg or more between 1963 and 1968 ("extreme
  weight losers") exhibited the following age-pooled risks of
  mortality relative to the stable weight group: for total
  mortality, 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.55); for all
  cardiovascular disease mortality, 1.40 (95% CI 1.16-1.69); for all
  non-cardiovascular disease mortality, 1.33 (95% CI 1.11-1.59); for coronary
  heart disease mortality, 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.93); and for cancer mortality,
  0.90 (95% CI 0.65-1.24). After adjustment for differences in coronary heart
  disease risk factor levels and morbidity between these groups at the end of
  the weight change period (1968), the excess risks associated
  with extreme weight loss declined by
<br>
  approximately one third. They declined further if adjustment was made for
  1963 (pre-weight-change period) morbidity and risk factor
  levels. Being on a slimming diet, as reported in 1963, was associated with an
  approximate doubling of excess mortality in men with extreme
  weight loss. Weight
<br>
  loss in 1963-1968 coincided with an increased incidence of
  coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus and a declining level of serum
  total cholesterol. This and other studies indicate that both
  voluntary and involuntary
<br>
  weight loss might be associated with a
  small increase in the risk of all-cause mortality.
