<a name="3253qlink1">These people that you are speaking of must be unfamiliar with the idea
of automation, no?  I mean, the only reason that people now look after
frozen cadavers themselves is that there aren't enough people signing
up to make it worth automating.  BTW, calling them "cadavers" sorta
begs the question, and betrays the assumption that these people are
really dead, rather than revivable.</a>
