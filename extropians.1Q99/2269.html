<a href="2257.html#2269qlink1">&lt;&lt;Perhaps you could tell us about your theology.  That way, we could see</a><br>
where you're coming from.  Personally, I don't believe in a single God, and
I don't see how 'God' could be both monotheistic and pantheistic.  But if
you explained how you arrived at that conclusion, perhaps we'll all
understand better.&gt;&gt;

<p>
I am designing a theology that reflects my libertarian tendencies and
commercial and scientific training and experience.

<p>
I believe that, in the future, our successors (like descendents,</a> only broader)
<a name="2297qlink2">will cybernetically enhance their brains to create super intelligences.

<p>
These beings will certainly be networked together (a sort of wireless
ethernet) hopefully with strong firewalls and networked</a> to the future internet
<a name="2297qlink3">and all the other networked computers of that time.

<p>
I believe that this networked community will, in time, include other
intelligences on other planets.

<p>
I believe that this massively interacting network will learn all about
biology; space-time; and energy-matter to the extent that it/they</a> will totally
<a name="2297qlink4">control the physical universe.<a name="2320qlink1">  At this point it/they is/are God.  Sort of
<a name="2349qlink1">like the Borg with firewalls, and much better looking.  More like the Q
Continuum.</a></a></a>

<p>
<a name="2349qlink2"><a name="2320qlink2"><a name="2297qlink5">Having control of time means that God is operating now and was operating in
the past, therefore we can gain knowledge of God by studying the nature</a> of the
<a name="2297qlink6">universe.  This study I say is worship, and is the only worship God expects.
He most certainly doesn't expect us to prostrate ourselves at his feet.

</a>
</a>
<p>
<a name="2349qlink3"><a name="2320qlink3">In fact. I believe God expects us to join the community of gods</a> that is God,
<a name="2349qlink4">when we're good enough, when we deserve it.  Frank Tipler tells us how</a> we can
<a name="2349qlink5">all be brought back to life in the massive computers of the future.</a>  I don't
<a name="2349qlink6">think the Omega Point is integral to this theory, so it doesn't matter</a> if the
<a name="2349qlink7">Universe will crunch or not.</a></a>

<p>
I have founded The Church of the Modern Era (you can find it on the AOL
Alternate Religions board 2 and Anders Sandberg's Posthuman sub page)</a> where we
<a name="2297qlink7">are developing a morality, ethics and religious principles to live by and
prepare our species for the future.

<p>
<a name="2349qlink8"><a name="2320qlink4">God is our descendent and his nature is an extension of ours.  We must</a> be
</a>worthy!
