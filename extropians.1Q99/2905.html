Is anyone interested in immortality for all?

<p>
Well, as a matter of fact, I am.  

<p>
Anders, I believe you expressed the concern that the concept of immortality
for all might encourage passivity.  I agree this is a serious concern.  For
those who would like immortality for all, I suggest the following
philosophical stance.  
<pre>
1) I want there to be some agency providing immortality for all.
2) I do not have any strong proof that there is such an agency.
3) Therefore, I should have the following goals.
</pre>

<OL>
  <li>  Discover a means to provide immortality for all.
  <li>  Ensure that someone is providing immortality for all.


</OL>
<p>
This, I believe, is an approach to the goal of immortality for all which
incorporates the Extropian principles of Practical Optimism and Rational
Thinking. 
<br>
<a name="2933qlink5">In a way, there is an implied agreement between those who are pursuing
immortality for all, that if I don't make it, you'll bring me back.  An
existential mutual defense treaty.  And the hope is, that if</a> enough people
hold this goal and try enough approaches, someone might find a way to do.
Indeed, someone might do it before you, but until you know that, you've still
got to work on the project.
