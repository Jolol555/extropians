<p>
What am I doing?

<p>
I'm trying to better myself and support my family.

<p>
I am increasing my skill set to better compete in the job market -
have gone from &lt; $11K (1995) to &gt; $50K(present).

<p>
I'm borrowing against my 401(k) to pay the $3500 the IRS demands of me
at risk of destroying my family (aka income taxes).

<p>
I'm trying to establish good credit after a youth of irresponsibility.

<p>
I'm doing my damndest to raise my 2 year-old son to be a rational,
kind, and productive extropian.

<p>
I'm eating good food and excersizing to keep my 30 year old identity
host from decaying so I can see the dawn of the Age of Immortality.

<p>
I'm absorbing as much knowledge as I can cram into my dense skull so
that I can change (profession, habits, thougthts, ideas, etc.) when
the time comes.

<p>
I pass along the transhuman memes to my coworkers, family and any
other audiences I come across.

<p>
I have no boasts of great deeds done in the name of bettering
humanity.  I haven't the drive, self-discipline, or desire to become a
mover or shaker.  I don't have the intelligence to invent the next
great technology.

<p>
My contribution is small, yes, but I don't think it's inconsequential.
 As long as we all keep the Extropian principles along with our own
personal principles close, we each contribute the best we can to the
<br>
"cause."<br>

<p>
Not all of us can be great leaders.  Some of us are satisfied with
being Extropian "grunts."

<p>
Onward Rational Soldiers!
