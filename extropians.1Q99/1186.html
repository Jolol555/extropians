Agreed.  Intelligently applied, it has huge destructive potential.

<a name="1203qlink2">Well, obviously we will still have nukes, and I imagine we'll be able to
make them a bit smaller than we can now.  I'm not sure why we are focusing
so much on nanobots, however - IMO, systems of cheap robotics with widely
varying scales are far more effective than swarms of nanobots.</a>

<p>
<a href="1180.html#1186qlink3">&gt; If I really wanted to be speculative, with respect to "nanofusion", I</a><br>

<i>&gt; barrier of neutron-catchers existed instead of a haphazard</i><br>
<i>&gt; crystal.  I'd expect nuclear reactions to be considerably more efficient</i><br>

I assume that by now you've read my post about the basic obstacles here.
Nanotech really doesn't do anything to address these problems, because it is
still based on normal matter and it only works at the level of chemistry.
The opacity of matter to neutrons is not affected by chemistry - it is
purely a matter of how many atomic nuclei you can pack into a given volume.
Absorbing hard radiation is a similar issue, and of course we can't change
the behavior of the nuclei themselves.

<p>
Now, I wouldn't be surprised if someone was able to make a 1 kg nuke using
nanotech.  Making a 1 mg nuke would require a more fundamental technology -
it belongs in the same realm as FTL drives, neutronium armor, and time
machines.

<p>
BTW - That doesn't mean I dismiss any of those things as fantasy.  I just
don't expect to see any of them before the emergence of SI.
