Morality, ethics, and so on appear to be little more than
contrivances of a society attempting to codify the evolutionary
advantage of altruism.  Instinctually, we attempt to maximize
the survivability of our genes.  Anything that does this is
viewed as right.  However, it is not as simple as doing things
that directly contribute to survivability.  Bob may rationalize
that robbing a bank would increase survivability.  But if such
an act goes unpunished, a precedent that stealing is ok emerges
and such a society becomes intolerable.  Thus, the benefit the society
receives from a society where stealing is intolerable outweighs
the benefit the society receives from an increase  to Bob's wealth.
Benefit being how such an act increases survivability of the group.

promotes the overall survivability of the group.</a>
