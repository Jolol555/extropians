<p>
IMO, Vinge has accomplished a rather unusual feat with this book: he has
taken a future considered wildly optimistic by most people, and shown it to
be a dystopia.  Perhaps he hopes to spur traditional SF fans to the kind of
consideration you suggest.

<p>
<a href="2692.html#2695qlink2">&gt; So does Vinge present a plausible detailed picture?  I'm not sure..</a><br>
<i>&gt; Limits to software complexity were plausibly presented, and so I</i><br>
<i>&gt; could buy the lack of AI or advanced automation.  Though the story</i><br>
<i>&gt; doesn't say so, I suppose complexity limits could also explain the</i><br>
<i>&gt; life extension limits described.  The failure to make substantial</i><br>
<i>&gt; progress in physics seemed more arbitrary, though I suppose very</i><br>
<i>&gt; subtle effects might remain hidden for millennia until the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; clues were presented.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; More puzzling was the failure to achieve anything like nanotech.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I suppose complexity limits could be behind this.  In one case,</i><br>
<i>&gt; a system with "a technology as high as Humankind ever attained"</i><br>
<i>&gt; achieved something close to nanotech, and the dust our hero</i><br>
<i>&gt; bought from them became a core element of all trader's starships,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the key to our hero's power.  But I don't recall that system</i><br>
<i>&gt; being noted for any other abilities to handle complexity.  (It</i><br>
<i>&gt; was particularly bad at life extension.)</i><br>

<p>
I really can't see any way to achieve this kind of limited future without
continuous intervention by a race of omnipotent super-beings (which, of
course, is exactly the justification Vinge is using).  There are just too
many things that should exist, and don't.  I find it hard to believe that
humans can't design even the simplest nanotech, and I don't see any way to
get such a hard limit on computer speeds.

<p>
<a href="2692.html#2695qlink3">&gt; Perhaps most puzzling is the failure to use any significant</a><br>
<i>&gt; fraction of the resources at each solar system.   Human populations</i><br>
<i>&gt; around a star are never more than "billions", and we see nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; like wholesale conversion of asteroids and comets.  "Sooner or later</i><br>
<i>&gt; [each system] ossified and politics carried it into a fall."</i><br>

<p>
I agree.  With the technology he allows, a solar system should easily be
capable of supporting trillions of humans.

<p>
<a href="2692.html#2695qlink4">&gt; These falls are very severe, often requiring re colonization from</a><br>
<i>&gt; the outside, and otherwise seem to require rebuilding from</i><br>
<i>&gt; scratch.  This is much more severe than the fall of the Roman</i><br>
<i>&gt; Empire, for example.  Powerful weapons of war might explain</i><br>
<i>&gt; this, but the worst weapons we see in the story are nukes.  Are</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuke wars really enough to destroy civilizations so thoroughly?</i><br>

<p>
IMHO, no.  You can re-establish a 1930s-era tech base with one machine shop,
a few hundred specialists, and a few thousand random people.  Even with
really big nukes, it is extremely difficult to cause enough damage to even
approach that situation.  A nuclear war of reasonable scale will usually
cause only a modest loss of technology, lasting less than a generation.

<p>
<a href="2692.html#2695qlink5">&gt; Now maybe growth rates were slower, though folks in the story</a><br>
<i>&gt; didn't bother to note any dramatic differences in growth rates</i><br>
<i>&gt; between places they'd traveled.  And even if the economy only</i><br>
<i>&gt; had a doubling time of one tenth the expected lifetime, then</i><br>
<i>&gt; in a thousand human systems more than half of human economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; power should reside in the single most advanced systems among</i><br>
<i>&gt; them.  Yet such a vast concentration of power was not noted</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the story.</i><br>

<p>
Good point.  A major civilization should easily be able to dominate its
neighbors.  With lifespans of 200 - 500 years, it should be possible to
establish interstellar governments over significant areas (you just need to
keep travel times down to a modest fraction of a human lifetime).

<p>
<a href="2692.html#2695qlink6">&gt; The frustrating thing about using science fiction to think</a><br>
<i>&gt; about these issues is not knowing whether the author thought</i><br>
<i>&gt; they had good reasons to expect things described, whether they</i><br>
<i>&gt; were just choices to make the story easier to tell, or whether</i><br>
<i>&gt; the author just didn't even notice them.  I suspect one big</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem is that Vinge doesn't really believe in these limits..</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2728qlink1">I think this whole setting is just a convenient set of excuses to allow him
to have human characters in a far-future setting.</a>  I suppose I can
understand that, considering how hard it would be to handle posthumans in a
novel, but it reduces the works predictive power to just about nil.
