<a name="3839qlink1">What about following through with the earlier idea about spreading our memes
by trying to develop courses in Transhumanism and get colleges to offer
them.  Perhaps the professors on the list could comment on how we might best
approach this task, how courses are introduced into departments, which
colleges/professors might be good for us to target, etc.</a>  I would guess that
we should go ahead and create a complete curriculum for an introductory
course.  Professors can and will customize it, but they may be more open to
the idea and appreciative if we can hand them a complete course.  Comments?
