<a href="2358.html#2398qlink1">&gt; 	There is also a good piece there entitle: "The Eternal Now" by</a><br>
<i>&gt; Jaron Lanier. &lt;URL: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/asap/99/0222/072.htm">http://www.forbes.com/asap/99/0222/072.htm</a>&gt;.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; completely agree with his declaration: "Information processing will</i><br>
<i>&gt; never spawn human consciousness in computers."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 	I really like what he says about "anticonsciousness smart</i><br>
<i>&gt; alecks":</i><br>
<i>&gt;    A small but robust cadre of intellectual shock</i><br>
<i>&gt;    artists these days is paid to assert that people aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt;    real. Every year one sees more books, mislabeled as</i><br>
<i>&gt;    popular science, aimed at furthering the claim that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    reader is an illusion: The Astonishing Hypothesis;</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Consciousness Explained; The User Illusion; How the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Mind Works. On and on, the formula repeats itself. An</i><br>
<i>&gt;    arrogant, overreaching title is essential, as is an</i><br>
<i>&gt;    overview of recent brain research to create an</i><br>
<i>&gt;    atmosphere of scientific authority. But the science is</i><br>
<i>&gt;    peripheral to the boast that the author has attained a</i><br>
<i>&gt;    superior vantage point from which to decimate the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    reader's tender sense of self.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2405qlink1">I had just the opposite reaction: what tentative respect I may have
had for Mr. Lanier was lost with this silly paragraph.  I suspect
that Mr. Lanier simply can't understand Dennett, so he invents this
defense to excuse his ignorance.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2405qlink2">The sense in which these authors claim that "we" don't exist is
exactly the same sense in which a rainbow doesn't exist: it's not
a thing "out there" that two people can observe and agree upon;
it is an illusion in which my experience differs from yours (since
my rainbow is centered on me, yours on you).  This is a simple,
explainable fact of science that any high-schooler should know.
Many people, presumably including Mr. Lanier, hold the assumption,
perhaps unstated, that the "mind" or "self" is something like a
cloud and not a rainbow; i.e., some "thing" that exists "out there"
rather than an effect of our perception.  This is a quite simple
thing to understand, and a reasonable thing for authors like
Dennett to try to explain.  Lanier's straw man parody and attack
is about as silly as someone saying "What do you mean a rainbow
doesn't exist--look, there it is!"  Nothing but clever prose to
mask ignorance of facts.
