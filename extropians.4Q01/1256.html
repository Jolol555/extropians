<p>Well, I don't know if Brian is actually counting the actual generations
<br>
or just winging it on 20 years per. Given the historical record of
<br>
middle aged men picking up second and third wives after the first one or
<br>
two had died from popping out too many young ones, 20 years per is a bit
<br>
on the low side, I'd think, unless all ancestors were children of first
<br>
wives.

<p>Anothuh Mainuh? What paht of Maine did he live in?
