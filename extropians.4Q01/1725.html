</em><br>
<p>Doing this without major disruption is impossible on its face.  Any
<br>
evacuation which entails giving up on the communities and jobs one
<br>
already has ties to, entails giving up on those things and at least
<br>
finding replacements (if not switching careers entirely), which is a
<br>
major disruption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Look forward to your opinions. I hope this turns into something we are

</em><br>
<p>I'm of two minds about this, but they both boil down to the same
<br>
thing:
<br>
<p>* We are already coming upon dark ages, but fleeing to the hills will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;do us no good.  It merely starves us of resources and takes us out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the worldwide conversation, thus handing victory to our enemies.
<br>
<p>* The &quot;dark ages&quot; trigger can not usefully be tested in advance.  99+%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;probability it will either go off while the situation is salvageable,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or fail to go off even after the situation has collapsed.  Either
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;way, evacuating upon this trigger is not useful.
<br>
<p>Both paths indicate that the plan you presented is not a good idea.
<br>
But both paths point to a refinment that may be useful: come up with a
<br>
refuge we can evacuate to that will *not* disconnect us from the world,
<br>
and evacuate there once it is ready.  Space colonies, for instance,
<br>
would seem to suit this role, if they can be made self-sufficient and
<br>
profitable enough to be a non-trivial part of the human economy.  But
<br>
that is many years away; to begin any sort of preparations to evacuate
<br>
now is to divert resources away from, for instance, actually making
<br>
that refuge possible.
