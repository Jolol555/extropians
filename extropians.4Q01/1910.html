spudboy100,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do everyone a favor and quote
<br>
CORRECTLY.
<br>
this passage
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;We are being farmed, people. Many people, when confronted with these
<br>
facts,
<br>
just say, &quot;well, some people are farmed, other are farmers. I plan on being
<br>
a farmer.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;Was courtesy of Randy, not me.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And while you have my attention...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierce has been very very careful to avoid
<br>
instructing his followers to practice violent methods.
<br>
For all his flaws and/or errors he is much like Duke
<br>
in this regard... he knows he has to preach lawful
<br>
change.. at least for the time being.  So accusing
<br>
him of being a coward on this count is way out of line.
<br>
Now if you accused him of being a coward for being
<br>
afraid of Jews or blacks or lots of little mulatto children
<br>
then that would be a supportable opinion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also you should learn to distinguish clearly between
<br>
lawyers  and career officers. They are very very different.
<br>
I suspect you have no military service by the tone of your
<br>
commentary. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. .
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And West Point/Annapolis is a far far more honourable
<br>
way to go than being an outright Marxist somewhere else.
<br>
<p><p>Have a nice day,
<br>
&nbsp;Brian
<br>
<p>&quot;and i believe, that we'll conceive
<br>
to make in hell for us a heaven,
<br>
a brave new world, a promised land,
<br>
a fortitude of hearts and minds..&quot;
<br>
-VNVN-
