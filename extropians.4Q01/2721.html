The main obstacle - almost the only one, given its relative size, and
<br>
definitely the one that needs to be tackled first - seems to be how
<br>
expensive it is to get stuff of human scale (like, say, human beings
<br>
and their life support systems) into orbit.  I'm seeing more and more
<br>
groups trying to tackle that problem, most famously (at the moment,
<br>
given as they seem to be all over the news after their recent rollout)
<br>
XCOR Aerospace.
<br>
<p>BTW, anyone else notice that the new NASA chief is from its historic
<br>
mortal enemy (so far as rivalries go in &quot;allied&quot; beauracracies), the
<br>
OMB?  This could be very good for NASA, or very bad for NASA.  Either
<br>
way, it is likely to be interesting...
