<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On my personal rant issue of marriage specifically, the contents and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration of marriage contracts would be utterly unacceptable if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied to business in most States.  Yet the State basically defines those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules by fiat, giving the individual little leeway in tailoring their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific &quot;relationship contract&quot; to meet there specific needs and desires.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In theory one could create a custom legal surrogate for State defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriage, but it would take a lot more effort.  I would prefer to
</em><br>
eliminate
<br>
<em>&gt; marriage as a special statutory contract altogether, as even if you accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basic premises of the statutory forms, the current incarnations are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally sub-optimal for most people.  Eliminating the &quot;one size fits
</em><br>
all&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; marriage contract would probably go a long way towards reducing the
</em><br>
divorce
<br>
<em>&gt; rate.  For starters, I think many people in today's western society would
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; better served by time limited contracts (none of this &quot;in perpetuity&quot;
</em><br>
crap)
<br>
<em>&gt; that have to be renewed, renegotiated, or simply dropped on regular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervals.  This would force the contracts to have proper exit/termination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clauses, the general lack of which is why divorce courts are so busy these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days.
</em><br>

<p>This has been done in various legal systems. Sh'ia Islam recognises two
<br>
kinds of marriage - Nikaa (for life but can be dissolved on certain grounds)
<br>
and Mutaa (a temporary contract with a renewal option, term can be anything
<br>
from an hour to [IIRC] ninetynine years). Ethiopian Christianity has a
<br>
similar system-apparently they have a third type which is binding beyond the
<br>
grave! Actually, in very recent history the actual legal practice of
<br>
marriage was very flexible, due to the existence of institutions such as
<br>
&quot;handfasting&quot; (essentially a trial marriage for a year and a day), &quot;common
<br>
law marriage&quot;, &quot;irregular marriage&quot; and folk divorce such as &quot;wife sale&quot;. It
<br>
was the state which put a stop to this throughout Europe. In the British
<br>
Empire the key event was Hardwicke's Marriage Act in 1753, so you can blame
<br>
it all on that. Steve Davies
