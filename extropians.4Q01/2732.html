<em>&gt; The drug-taking artist is a cliché just as the moody artist; there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of examples, but also many artists who neither have emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems or use chemicals. Compared to (say) journalists artists are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite temperate. That said, quite a few people with neurochemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imbalances do self-medicate - by trial and error they find drugs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce a manageable mindstate (this is why so many schizophrenics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoke). And I think people do self-medication to maximize their mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities too - alcohol can in the right dosage and at the right time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve the creative process (at least the incubation phase of it).
</em><br>
<p>agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm curious about your claim  about quantum precision phase shifters -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you have any support for this claim? In my field, computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroscience, the battle is still raging about how much is spike timing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and frequency coding. But not even the spike camp claims the spikes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *that* well timed.
</em><br>
<p>therse codes are used, but rather for perception devices.
<br>
fast predictions done in cortex are done that way - neurotransmitters're put
<br>
by imagination, the frequency of spikes represents signal significance (time
<br>
importance,
<br>
or priority, which is easy to check thru EEG (with electrode inside head) or
<br>
MRI (realtime rather than scan)
<br>
i it was described in Zernicki's book about neurology in about 1977 (date
<br>
may be wrong)
<br>
<p>learning of new behaviour is depent on chemical (axon will grow only where
<br>
certain substance exists,
<br>
so this is why we 'getting around' somthing untl we finnaly 'catch it' (this
<br>
is - one full loop - the axion is reaching
<br>
proper neruotransmitter at proper autosopher branch)
<br>
<p>perception lies on phase-detecting. i.e. in visual cortex autosopher
<br>
oragnises neurotransmitters around
<br>
certain object viewed on retina and decoded into lines and geometric shapes
<br>
by first visual cortex.
<br>
but the consiousness process will use only 'fastest' - most apropriate -
<br>
path, while all others will cause
<br>
signal to be decoded a little longer (so - more likely with errors -
<br>
checksum is on chemicals, and 'backprop'
<br>
is electrical).
<br>
i.e. you have a circle on the input, so neurotransmitters will choose
<br>
'circles' and backpropagation 'probes'
<br>
which autosopher is correct (the shortest way signal arrives - the more
<br>
likely it will be truth)
<br>
so if representations of circle in lines shown in projecting cortex will
<br>
match circle - the fastest 'feedback' will be
<br>
reached from 'circle circuit representation', next - oval, next - square,
<br>
and so on.
