<p>
It's from a Time magazine a few years old but I found some interesting stuff about
<br>
NEST, a sort of high tech SWAT team that detects nuclear weapons:
<br>
=======================
<br>
<p>Helicopters equipped with radiation detectors can sweep over a city but a nuclear
<br>
weapon gives off little telltale radiation and is nearly impossible to find from above
<br>
a dense, urban area. Most of the search must be conducted on the ground. Minivans
<br>
are rented at the local airport, the backseats removed and replaced with electronic
<br>
detectors that can sniff the neutrons and gamma radiation a nuclear device might emit.
<br>
The vans, however, are only good for use in large open areas like parking lots and highways.
<br>
To search narrow streets and buildings, as many as 100 two-person teams, dressed as
<br>
inconspicuously as possible, are sent on foot patrols. One team member carries a special
<br>
radiation detector designed to be hidden in briefcases, student backpacks, laptop computer
<br>
bags--even beer coolers, in the case of a threat to vaporize the Super Bowl.
<br>
<p>One of the searchers, &quot;Becky&quot; (she asked that her real name not be used), described how
<br>
she made her rounds on a recent training exercise in a large city. A 31-year-old Energy
<br>
Department employee who began training as a nest searcher seven years ago, Becky and
<br>
10 colleagues were assigned to hunt for a simulated nuclear device in a hotel with 32 floors
<br>
and 2,052 rooms.
<br>
<p>Walking down the corridors, Becky and her male partner looked like the typical tourist
<br>
couple on vacation, dressed in Bermuda shorts and T shirts, cameras slung over their
<br>
necks. But hidden in Becky's suitcase was a sophisticated sodium iodide crystal detector
<br>
to sniff minute amounts of gamma radiation from as far away as another room. Halfway
<br>
down a corridor, Becky suddenly heard &quot;the voice,&quot; an irritating robotic message transmitted
<br>
from the suitcase to a wireless, button-sized beige receiver in her ear. &quot;Gamma alarm four,&quot;
<br>
the voice droned. That was a strong radiation signal. She glanced left at the room number on
<br>
the next door and subtracted three from it. The detector's microcomputer takes several
<br>
seconds to analyze the radiation and calculate its strength, so the room three doors behind
<br>
her must have been the one actually giving off gamma rays. Becky and her partner never
<br>
turned around or slowed their pace, lest they attract attention from other guests. At the end
<br>
of the corridor, they looked back nonchalantly, then ducked into the stairwell. Becky pulled
<br>
out a small radio from her purse. &quot;We have a hit,&quot; she whispered, and relayed the room number.
<br>
The searchers had found the simulated nuclear device, which had been emitting a harmless
<br>
amount of radiation, in less than two hours.
<br>
<p>As if the searching weren't nerve-racking enough, operating the detectors requires great skill
<br>
because the instruments, sensitive enough to home in on a bomb, can be confused by the
<br>
soup of a metropolis' naturally occurring radiation. Freshly paved roads, yellow rest-room tiles,
<br>
the Vermont granite used in some of Washington's federal buildings, a patient walking out of a
<br>
hospital after radiation therapy, even a bunch of bananas can set off the detectors. Finding a
<br>
nuclear bomb in a city, according to a searcher, &quot;is like looking for a needle in a haystack of needles.&quot;
