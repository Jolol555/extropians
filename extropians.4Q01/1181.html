As one who is really knocked on his ass by UR infections (flu and colds) I
<br>
am very aware of hygiene and also old enough to remember when if you had a
<br>
cold you did not go out in public. Or if you were a kid in a movie theater
<br>
with a cold the usher took you outside. Or if someone coughed in public,
<br>
people would look and ask quietly if they had TB. I also remember the Polio
<br>
summers. Today most people have personal hygiene that would embarrass a pig
<br>
and think nothing of exposing others to their colds and flu's. The spanish
<br>
flu (1914?) killed a third of the human population (someone correct me on
<br>
the numbers). 
<br>
It would appear we are building the human density, transportation to spread
<br>
disease and a lack of hygiene that will set us up for another &quot;spanish flu&quot;
<br>
event.
<br>
<p>In future history, 911 will be a footnote.
