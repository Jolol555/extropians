NOTE: I am not a lawyer, and this is not advice. I am basing this on my copy of the POST module 40
<br>
police training manual.
<br>
<p>Correction regarding CA laws:
<br>
<p>1) Long guns are &quot;inherently legal&quot;, still; they are not &quot;concealable&quot; so you can't violate
<br>
the &quot;concealed carry&quot; law and can't _in theory_ be busted if you aren't doing anything else 
<br>
illegal. 
<br>
<p>Don't carry it loaded in public, though; that's a misdemeanor the first time and a felony the second.
<br>
<p>In reality you *will* get hassled by most cops who will bust you for a broken shoelace just 
<br>
to get you off the street and potentially into a &quot;5150&quot; (involuntary commitment) straightjacket.
<br>
<p>Then there's the &quot;gun free school zone&quot; law to contend with, and municipalities that don't understand
<br>
the state preemption law, et tiresome cetera. 
<br>
<p>And even if you broke no law, you'll probably have to hire a lawyer to get your piece back. 
<br>
Over and over. Sucks.
<br>
<p>2) There is at least one semieffective (semiauto) weapon that hasn't crossed the &quot;banned&quot; list in 
<br>
.223, but it's only a matter of time. Ditto for .308. I would say what they are, but why speed that day?

<p>Um. Not entirely true on #2, I think. Las Vegas is a big Babylon, perfect for a long-latency bio attack.
<br>
<p>Further comments on firearms, Stingers, etc. in private communications only, please.
