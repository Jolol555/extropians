<br>
<p>A YEAR OF CONTRASTS:
<br>
COURAGE, SACRIFICE AND ... CORPORATE GREED
<br>
<p>By Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-VT.)
<br>
<p>As we reflect on the year 2001, our minds catapult to the World Trade
<br>
Center in flames and hundreds of courageous firemen and police officers
<br>
racing up stairs to try to save their trapped fellow citizens. Almost all
<br>
of them gave their lives in this heroic effort.
<br>
<p>For the last several months, the nation has been impressed by the
<br>
dedication and discipline of American troops in Afghanistan successfully
<br>
fighting to help rid the world of international terrorism. Some of these
<br>
young people have died or been wounded.
<br>
<p>Throughout the country, in the wake of September 11th, there has been a
<br>
growing sense of coming together and shared sacrifice. Hundreds of millions
<br>
of dollars have been donated to special funds for the families of the
<br>
victims, and Americans are taking a deeper look at the meaning of their lives.
<br>
<p>And then of course there are the titans of corporate America.
<br>
Unfortunately, for many of them, it's the same old story. Greed, greed and
<br>
more greed.
<br>
<p>Case in point is the Enron Corporation, which, just last year, was the
<br>
seventh largest company in America with revenue exceeding $100 billion and
<br>
over 20,000 employees. Having contributed millions in campaign
<br>
contributions to the Republican Party and the President, the company was
<br>
strongly positioned to influence the direction of energy policies in the
<br>
Bush Administration. One of the results of their efforts was a huge
<br>
increase in electric rates in California.
<br>
<p>Earlier this year, Enron was forced to admit that it had over-reported its
<br>
profits by nearly $600 million. This led to the largest bankruptcy in
<br>
history. While Enron was exaggerating its profits, and before its
<br>
artificially high stock price plummeted, three top executives in the
<br>
company, Lou Pai, Kenneth Lay and Jeff Skilling cashed in stock options
<br>
worth some $560 million. Like rats on a sinking ship, they got their money
<br>
out just in time. But they didn't give that same opportunity to their
<br>
employees. While Enron's stock was crashing, the company forced more than
<br>
12,000 of its employees to retain Enron stock in their 401(k) pension
<br>
plans. This caused massive losses for the workers and many lost their
<br>
entire retirement savings.
<br>
<p>Taxpayers will be delighted to know that the House Republicans included a
<br>
$254 million corporate welfare check for Enron as part of their so-called
<br>
&quot;economic stimulus plan.&quot; But it's not just Enron.
<br>
<p>The American people continue to pay by far the highest prices in the world
<br>
for prescription drugs. Many of the same drugs sold in this country by
<br>
American drug companies are sold abroad at a fraction of the price. The
<br>
result is that millions of Americans suffer, and some die, because they are
<br>
unable to afford the medicine they need.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, year after year, drug companies constitute the most profitable
<br>
industry in our country. Last year, they had profits that exceeded $30
<br>
billion. At a time when elderly citizens cut their dosages in half, nine
<br>
executives at the top pharmaceutical corporations in the U.S. were given
<br>
$890 million in stock options according to Families USA. This is on top of
<br>
the $169.9 million in wages, bonuses and other compensation that these
<br>
executives are already receiving.
<br>
<p>How does the pharmaceutical industry manage to rip off the American people,
<br>
generate huge profits, get massive tax breaks and provide outrageous
<br>
compensation packages for their top management? Easy. As the wealthiest
<br>
political lobby in Washington they have spent, over the last three years,
<br>
more than $200 million in campaign contributions, lobbying activities and
<br>
media advertising
<br>
<p>Even in the face of the bioterrorism attack on the United States, the drug
<br>
giants are choosing profits over the health of the American people. When
<br>
the federal government chose to stockpile the antibiotic Cipro, the &quot;deal&quot;
<br>
struck with the drug companies requires the government to pay far more than
<br>
is charged by generic manufacturers abroad, and, in fact, more than the
<br>
federal government itself already pays under a different program.
<br>
<p>But wait, corporate self-dealing doesn't end there. Take, for example, Big
<br>
Blue. As the holiday season approached, IBM announced a new round of job
<br>
cuts. According to published news reports, the company has cut more than
<br>
5,000 jobs in the United States since July. Meanwhile, they are building
<br>
two new micro-processing plants in China where workers are paid a fraction
<br>
of what American workers receive. To IBM watchers, this latest act is par
<br>
for the course.
<br>
Two years ago, despite record-breaking profits and a pension fund surplus
<br>
of some $10 billion, IBM slashed pension and retirement health benefits for
<br>
workers in 1999 and 2000 and curtailed salaries in 2001. Meanwhile, the CEO
<br>
of IBM, Louis Gerstner, raked in $176 million in total compensation and
<br>
stock options over the past 2 years. In addition, he has accumulated over
<br>
$260 million in unexercised stock options from IBM during his tenure. While
<br>
slashing the pension plans of IBM employees, he negotiated a retirement
<br>
plan over $1.1 million a year for himself.
<br>
<p>Once again, no bad deed goes unrewarded. If the House Republican leadership
<br>
gets its way IBM will receive $1.4 billion in corporate welfare this year.
<br>
<p>This country has gone through an extremely traumatic year, and we are now
<br>
confronting serious economic and security issues. It would be nice if, for
<br>
once, some of our corporate leaders looked out for someone other than
<br>
themselves.
