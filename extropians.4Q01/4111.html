Here's a quote about nanotech based solar energy from Unbounding the
<br>
Future by Drexler et al, at
<br>
<a href="http://www.foresight.org/UTF/Unbound_LBW/chapt_7.html">http://www.foresight.org/UTF/Unbound_LBW/chapt_7.html</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External walls, roofs, and paving surfaces are exposed to sunlight, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sunlight carries energy. A proven ability of molecular machinery is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conversion of sunlight to stored energy: plants do it every day. Even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now, we can make solar cells that convert sunlight into electricity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at efficiencies of 30 percent or so. Molecular manufacturing could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not only make solar cells much cheaper, but could also make them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tiny enough to be incorporated into the mobile building blocks of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smart paint.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be efficient, this paint would have to be dark-that is, would have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to absorb a lot of light. Black would be best, but even light colors
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could generate some power, and efficiency isn't everything. Once
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the paint was applied, its building blocks would plug together to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pool their electrical power and deliver it through some standard
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plug. A thicker, tougher form of this sort of material could be used
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to resurface pavement, generate power, and transmit it over large
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distances. Since smart solar-cell pavement could be designed for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improved traction and a similar roofing material could be designed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for amazing leak-resistance, the stuff should be popular.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a sunny day, an area just a few paces on a side would generate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a kilowatt of electrical power. With good batteries (and enough
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repaved roads and solar-cell roofing), present demands for electrical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power could be met with no coal burning, no oil imports, no nuclear
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power, no hydroelectric dams, and no land taken over for solar power
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation plants.
<br>
<p>Another page I found calculates how much area would be needed by solar
<br>
collectors using present-day efficiencies to collect enough energy to
<br>
equal all the energy usage of the United States.  (Of course this is
<br>
only good for comparison purposes, since not all energy uses could be
<br>
converted easily to electrical power.)
<br>
<a href="http://www.nmsea.org/Curriculum/7_12/The_Solar_Resource.htm">http://www.nmsea.org/Curriculum/7_12/The_Solar_Resource.htm</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find that we would need an area of 1.29 x 10^4 square miles, which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an area 100 miles by 129 miles, to completely power the US.
<br>
<p>That's a very modest size.  Solar energy has many disadvantages, but
<br>
it is a mistake to suggest that a substantial part of the country would
<br>
have to be covered with solar cells in order to generate enough energy.
