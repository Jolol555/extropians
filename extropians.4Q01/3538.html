<p>Hey, live is cheap, heh?  And which &quot;they&quot; will it be after the
<br>
&quot;they&quot; of the moment is wiped out along with all of &quot;they&quot; who
<br>
might think that wasn't the best thing to do and those others,
<br>
&quot;they&quot; who are also became our declared enemies because we have
<br>
become their most dangerous &quot;they&quot;?  If you follow this logic
<br>
very far the world becomes a very dangerous and most horrible
<br>
place pretty quickly.  
<br>
<p>I vote for a little more expansion of &quot;us&quot; to include more of
<br>
&quot;they&quot;.  And, even before that, I think it is high time to stop
<br>
assuming that wiping out those we insist are totally other and
<br>
the &quot;evil doers and all their associates&quot; will ever make this
<br>
world a better place or one whit safer.
<br>
<p>I fought against the &quot;pacifist&quot; word before.  Especially as so
<br>
many seem to have only negative and limited ideas of what it or
<br>
non-violence means.  But hey, I think we could use a few more
<br>
people who take that on about now.  Count me in.
