: &gt; Citizens and foreign nationals pulled in in an open sweep on no
<br>
: &gt; grounds or very weak grounds or their nationality or the
<br>
: &gt; ethnicity or their religion or age and gender or some
<br>
: &gt; combination ... are &quot;prisoners of war&quot;?  Excuse me?
<br>
: &gt;
<br>
:
<br>
: What are you calling a &quot;open sweep&quot;?  I have only heard of one or two
<br>
people
<br>
: picked up in any given location.
<br>
:
<br>
: The officials deny pulling anyone in based on ethnicity or religion.  They
<br>
: say they only picked up people who has a specific connection to the
<br>
: terrorists.
<br>
:
<br>
: As for &quot;age&quot; and &quot;gender&quot;... I haven't even heard of private citizens
<br>
: running around discriminating on the basis of &quot;age&quot; or &quot;gender&quot;.  The
<br>
: inclusion of these in the list makes your complaint look like paranoia,
<br>
: rather than a response to what is actually happening.
<br>
:
<br>
: &gt; The majority of these people are not even accused of having
<br>
: &gt; knowledge but are brought in just in case they do or in order
<br>
: &gt; for the government to look like it is doing something, even if
<br>
: &gt; it is wrong, morally questionable and very dangerous to human
<br>
: &gt; and civil rights.  It is up to us to take note and to question.
<br>
:
<br>
: Yes, people were picked up and questioned if it was thought that they knew
<br>
: something, but about a week ago, Attourny General (Ashcroft) said that the
<br>
: only people still in custody are those who have broken the law.  Some of
<br>
: them are &quot;only&quot; breaking immigration laws, but everyone except criminals
<br>
: have been released.
