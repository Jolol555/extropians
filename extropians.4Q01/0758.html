<em>&gt; &quot;Donkeys,&quot; said Nasrudin.
</em><br>
<p>Nice story... it reminds me of the story of Nasruddin's secret.
<br>
A disciple came to Mulla Nasuddin and asked the Mulla, &quot;I've heard that you
<br>
have the secret, the ultimate secret... the key which can open all the doors
<br>
of mystery.
<br>
Nasruddin said, &quot;Yes, I've got it. But what about it? Why are you asking about
<br>
it?&quot;
<br>
The man fell to his feet and said, &quot;I was in search of you, Master. If you
<br>
have the key and the secret, tell it to me.&quot;
<br>
Nasruddin said, &quot;If it is such a secret, you must understand that it cannot be
<br>
told so easily. You will have to wait.&quot;
<br>
The disciple asked, &quot;How long?&quot; Nasruddin said, &quot;That is not certain. It
<br>
depends on your patience. It could take three years or thirty years.&quot;
<br>
The disciple waited. After three years he asked again. Nasruddin said, &quot;If you
<br>
ask again, then it will take thirty years. Just wait. It is not an ordinary
<br>
thing. It is the ultimate secret.&quot;
<br>
Thirty years passed and the disciple said, &quot;Master, now my whole life is
<br>
wasted. I have not got anything. Now, give me the secret.&quot;
<br>
Nasruddin said, &quot;There is a condition: You will have to promise me that you
<br>
will keep it a secret, and you will not tell anyone.&quot;
<br>
The man said, &quot;I promise you that it will remain a secret until I die. I will
<br>
not mention it to anyone.&quot;
<br>
Nasruddin said, &quot;Thank you. This is the promise that I made to my Master. And
<br>
if you can keep it a secret until death, what do you think? Cannot I keep it a
<br>
secret?&quot;
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
