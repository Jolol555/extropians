<br>
<em>&gt; And, women are more prone to automobile accidents according
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to statistics because they spend more time on the roads, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistically they will obviously have more accidents.  Men
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are busy 8+ hours of the day at work, or committing crime,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the women are out driving around spending all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damned money.
</em><br>
<p>As a matter of fact, despite that men drive more miles than do females, men
<br>
have fewer accidents per mile driven than do female drivers.
<br>
<p>If you want data on men as better drivers, take a look at the names of the
<br>
winners of auto races (which are open to anyone with a qualifying lap
<br>
time). If you want data on men as safer drivers, it's harder to find (gee,
<br>
I wonder why -- duh!). Try:
<br>
<a href="http://ntl.bts.gov/data/safety/accidents/00300.pdf">http://ntl.bts.gov/data/safety/accidents/00300.pdf</a>
<br>
male/female crash likelihood = 1.29/1.38
<br>
AND, don't forget that females may actually CAUSE accidents without being
<br>
directly involved. For instance, going slow in the fast lane while
<br>
applying make-up, thus encouraging other drivers to pass on the right, and
<br>
so forth.

<p>Better Hand/eye Coordination of Male Drivers Reduces Accidents
<br>
<a href="http://members.easyspace.com/fathers/mensafety.htm">http://members.easyspace.com/fathers/mensafety.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Males score  42% higher than females in hand/eye coordination events like
<br>
springboard and platform diving.
<br>
<p>The  lower hand/eye coordination skills of females doubles their
<br>
likelihood of having a fatal traffic accident.
<br>
<p>10,573 more traffic fatalities and 428,484 more non-fatal accidents each
<br>
year are caused by the lower hand/eye coordination skills of females.
<br>
<p>If all drivers had a safety record equivalent to female drivers, there
<br>
would be 39% more traffic accidents annually.
<br>
<p>If all drivers nationwide had the same traffic safety record as male
<br>
passenger car drivers, there would be 21,795 fewer traffic fatalities in
<br>
the US annually.
<br>
<p>Per Traffic Safety Facts' &quot;Vehicle Miles of Travel, 1975-1996&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/www/cfm/library/rpt_info.cfm?index=Trends:Oc">http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/www/cfm/library/rpt_info.cfm?index=Trends:Oc</a>
<br>
cupants&amp;recordid=0   Americans drove passenger cars 1,478 billion miles in
<br>
1995.
<br>
<p>Per the &quot;Early Results Report&quot; of the Nationwide Personal Transportation
<br>
Survery <a href="http://www-cta.ornl.gov/npts/1995/Doc/index.shtml">http://www-cta.ornl.gov/npts/1995/Doc/index.shtml</a> men drive 65.3%
<br>
or 965 billion  and women drive 513 billion of those miles.
<br>
<p>Per Traffic Safety Facts' &quot;Drivers Involvement in Crashes&quot; from the FARS
<br>
data base
<br>
<a href="http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/www/cfm/library/rpt_info.cfm?index=People:Dr">http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/www/cfm/library/rpt_info.cfm?index=People:Dr</a>
<br>
ivers&amp;recordid=0 male drivers were involved in 2,418,799 fatal and injury
<br>
crashes and female drivers were involved in 1,701,043.
<br>
<p>Women are one third more likely than men per mile driven to have a fatal
<br>
or injury accident, 0.332 vs. 0.251 per 100,000 miles driven, and 17% more
<br>
likely to have a property damage only accident, 0.586 vs. 0.502.
<br>
<p>Per the NHTSA <a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/economic/ecomvc1994.html">http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/economic/ecomvc1994.html</a> the
<br>
economic cost of motor vehicle crashes in 1994 was $150.5 billion.
<br>
<p>If all drivers had the same probability of having an accident as male
<br>
drivers, then males would have an even lower accident rate than they
<br>
currently have,  because they wouldn't be colliding with women who have
<br>
one third more accidents than men.
<br>
<p>For whatever reason, statistics are routinely abused by the media to
<br>
conceal important safety facts.  Look at the numbers behind the numbers
<br>
before accepting such myths.  Men drive 2 1/2 times as many miles as
<br>
women.  Such an article could obscure for the next 4 decades that, per mile
<br>
driven, males have a lower traffic accident rate than females.  Also, the
<br>
male accident rate is higher than it would be if it were not for the
<br>
higher female accident rate.  If female drivers had accidents with only
<br>
other female drivers, then they would not contribute to an increase in the
<br>
male accident rate.  But female drivers also have accidents with male
<br>
drivers, which increases the accident rate for males by 51.6%.
<br>
California's statistics show that the accident rate for males per 100
<br>
Million miles, rather than 313.3 as it now is, would be only 201 if all
<br>
drivers had the same safety record as male drivers (see calculations
<br>
below). Conversely, if all drivers had a safety record equivalent to
<br>
female drivers (506.3 accidents per 100 Million miles), there would be
<br>
39.4% more accidents each year.
<br>
<p>There are 80.7% more accidents today than if all drivers had the
<br>
demonstrated safety record per 100 Million miles of California's male
<br>
drivers. See Calculations below for Chart A
<br>

<br>
<p>Table 3-19 from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, reports the
<br>
accident rate for &quot;Large Trucks&quot; (mostly male drivers) is 203 per 100
<br>
Million miles, giving credence to this estimated accident rate for
<br>
California male drivers.  Per the National Safety Council, the loss to
<br>
motor vehicle accidents each year is $170.6 Billion. If this safety ratio
<br>
applies across the nation, a 44.7% reduction in the accident rate could
<br>
save the nation $76.3 Billion per year, or 1.1% of GDP--before taking into
<br>
account the benefits of reduced miles driven, reduced traffic congestion,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>The article also noted that &quot;even though [truckers] drive about 21% of the
<br>
registered vehicles on the road, [they] were involved in only 3% of the
<br>
state's fatal accidents&quot;.  CHP spokeswoman Pat Ryan, a former trucker,
<br>
said &quot;Our general experience has been that commercial drivers are safer
<br>
drivers.  They have to be; it's their livelihood&quot;.  This is a bit
<br>
misleading because it fails to note two important data points:
<br>
<p>Males, demonstrably involved in 40% fewer accidents per mile, are 89% of
<br>
the nation's truckers (Bureau of Labor Statistics: 3,454,000 male, 428,000
<br>
female, truck drivers).
<br>
The percent of registered vehicles which are trucks is not as significant
<br>
as the fact that truckers drive 32.4% of the nation's miles (US
<br>
Statistical Abstract, 865 Billion of 2,667 Billion miles driven each year
<br>
are by truckers).
<br>
Thus California truckers, for each mile driven, are responsible for 1/11th
<br>
as many fatal accidents as the drivers of passenger cars, not 1/7th.  We
<br>
can predict that 89% of them have a 50% lower probability of having an
<br>
accident.  This still means that California truckers are involved in
<br>
almost 1/6th as many fatal accidents per mile as passenger car drivers
<br>
are, which is a real tribute to their profession.
<br>
<p>Nationally, as relatively safe as California truckers are, &quot;Traffic Safety
<br>
Facts 1995&quot; from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
<br>
reports large trucks still &quot;account for&quot; 4,439 of the 41,798 motor vehicle
<br>
fatalities each year; light trucks account for 9,539 of these fatalities;
<br>
drivers 15-20 years of age -- 7,993; motorcyclists -- 2,221; and passenger
<br>
cars, utility trucks and vans operated by drivers over 20 years of age --
<br>
17,606.
<br>
<p>If all of the nation's car drivers had a safety record equivalent to male
<br>
drivers, then drivers nationwide would be 4 times less likely than female
<br>
drivers to be involved in fatal traffic accidents.See Calculations below

<p>If it has the potential to save the nation 1.1% of GDP and 10,753 lives
<br>
per year, what is the savings to the nation of an all-male military?  What
<br>
do you think can or should be done about it?  How much are we as taxpayers
<br>
willing to spend to afford women super rights, when we as taxpayers cannot
<br>
find any benefit from this at all, and particularly when it is so costly
<br>
in both dollars and lives?  This is how Congress views it:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;102d Congress 1st Session
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rept. 102171
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the period from 1967%1989, the mileage death rate in this country
<br>
dropped
<br>
from 5.2 deaths to 2.2 deaths per 100 million miles of travel. In the last
<br>
ten
<br>
years alone, the death rate from motor vehicle crashes has been cut by
<br>
more than
<br>
25%. NHTSA estimates that, in 1988 alone, 6,506 lives were saved by
<br>
highway safety
<br>
laws and programs: 4,500 saved by safety belts; 1,148 saved by minimum
<br>
drinking
<br>
age laws, 608 saved by motorcycle helmets; and 250 saved by child
<br>
restraints.
<br>
Alcohol-related fatalities have been reduced from 50% of the national
<br>
fatality
<br>
rate to around 37%.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, traffic crashes are still the leading cause of accidental
<br>
death in
<br>
the U.S., responsible for 34 times the number of accidental deaths as
<br>
firearms,
<br>
and 52 times the number of air transport deaths. There are twice as many
<br>
highway
<br>
deaths as there are homicides. Motor vehicle accidents cost our society
<br>
more than
<br>
$48 billion in injury costs every year. And drunk driving still is the
<br>
leading
<br>
factor in the highway crash statistic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the large number of people who are killed and injured on the
<br>
higways
<br>
every year and the substantial projected increase in motor
<br>
vehicle-relatedfatalities and
<br>
injuries over the next decade, the Committee believes it is
<br>
imperative to continue to initiate and to support programs which address
<br>
highway
<br>
safety issues and problems.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this title, the Committee has attempted to make the public
<br>
welfare
<br>
its first and foremost consideration, while persevering in its attempt to
<br>
create
<br>
a new intermodal transportation system that reflects greater state
<br>
participation
<br>
and places fewer burdens on state programming. Toward that end, the
<br>
Committee has
<br>
modified its support for sanctions and, instead, is relying primarily on
<br>
incentives and reprogramming of highway construction funds to highway
<br>
safety to
<br>
encourage state compliance with the programs established herein.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Committee has incorporated reprogramming as a means of
<br>
encouraging
<br>
compliance, it has done so in its focus on national policy as that policy
<br>
relates
<br>
to public good. The Committee has also done so in the belief that highway
<br>
safety
<br>
can be improved in all respects by tying reprogrammed funds to highway
<br>
safety
<br>
programs.

<p>CALCULATIONS FOR CHART A
<br>
Some accidents involve only one driver and some involve 3 or more, a rough
<br>
average of 2 drivers per accident, giving us (958,784 accidents divided by
<br>
2 drivers/accident), or 479,392 accidents per year.  The probability of a
<br>
male having an accident is X, and the probability of a female having an

<br>
then the number of C accidents would have been 88,383.5 rather than

146,893.4, which is 58,509.9 less.  Instead of 479,392 accidents, if
<br>
drivers B &amp; C had had the same skill as drivers A, there would have been
<br>
only 265,150 accidents, which is 214,242, or 44.7%, fewer accidents, and
<br>
428,484 fewer drivers involved in accidents.  This is an accident rate of
