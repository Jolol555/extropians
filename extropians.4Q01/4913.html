</em><br>
<p><p>They had several dozen religious categories when I was in the Army, and they
<br>
add new ones all the time; whatever you call yourself, odds are it is on the
<br>
list.  They also sub-divided &quot;protestant&quot; into more categories (e.g.
<br>
&quot;Methodist&quot;) to accommodate the nuances of various sects of religions.  The
<br>
current military criteria for adding a new religious perspective to the
<br>
rather long current list of officially recognized religions in the military
<br>
revolves around the number of practitioners in the military.  I use
<br>
&quot;religious perspective&quot; since the list contains a number of things that
<br>
aren't actually religions per se.  There are a number of religions that many
<br>
people would consider cults currently on the list, so there is almost no
<br>
discrimination as to what actually shows up and the US military goes out of
<br>
its way to officially acknowledge the religious views of everyone.
<br>
<p>In addition to all the specified religious perspectives, there is &quot;Other&quot;,
<br>
&quot;No preference&quot;, and &quot;None&quot;.  My dog tags had &quot;None&quot; on them, as I have no
<br>
religious perspective.
<br>
<p>As for the number of Muslims in the US military, the number of self
<br>
identified Muslims (all sects inclusive) is around 2,500 soldiers.
