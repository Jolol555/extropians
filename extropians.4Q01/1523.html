</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;------
</em><br>
<p><p>Hmmm. Yeah...
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let me clarify: I think that people with advanced degrees in science and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expecially MD's are beneficial to the &quot;owners&quot; of America (its citizens) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;therefore I espouse allowing them into our country, our commonly property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Just as many businesses seek to hire people who will benefit the business.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If I, Randy Smith, own a business, and I want to hire, I hire the person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will benefit me, Randy Smith.  And if I am a partner in a business, we, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;partners, will dicuss candidates, and hire the ones that benefit us, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;partners, the most.  The candidates that are more likely to put more pieces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of green paper in the wallets of the partners are those candidates who will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be hired. An advanced degree is science is often a good marker of such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;candidate (in many cases).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;#### So, if you want to fire a few slow and spoiled locals and hire a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cheaper but faster and better immigrants, it's a good business practice. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree.
</em><br>
<p>Only when the numbers involved are small, and the benefit is great. By great 
<br>
benefit, I mean *real science*, or some *special* skill.  Importing database 
<br>
coders to enhance stockholder wallets and CEO bonuses does not qualify.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And I like your metaphor of America as a common business property of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all its citizens.
</em><br>
<p>Just remember something--&quot;laziness&quot; of a business owner is a meaningless 
<br>
concept unless you are a *partner* in the business. If you own a welding 
<br>
shop, and you prefer not to work on weekends, I, as a non-partner, have no 
<br>
right to throw you out and take because I see you as lazy.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That, my friend, is the way of the world. Unfortunately, many of my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AMerican
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;citizen-partners have been swayed by very wealthy parties such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corporations, who benefit from bringing in more immigrants to lower wages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;### But now you are saying that the impersonal &quot;corporations&quot; should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;allowed to follow your personal lead and hire cheap immigrants, as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descibed in the preceding paragraph.  Are you saying that the coporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and their mainly American owners and employees should be denied the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights of association that you claim for yourself? They also want to &quot;put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more pieces of green paper in the wallets of the partners&quot;, just like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but naturally there are conflicting interests involved in such a large 
<br>
partnership.  And when the partnership is so large, and the money involved 
<br>
is so great, and so much is concentrated in so few hands, I expect to see 
<br>
massive propaganda campaigns waged, just as in any election, etc.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do you think of MY &quot;impartial economic analysis&quot; above?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;##### I understand your position well, but I wouldn't call it impartial -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you would like to have the benefits (ability to hire a cheaper worker for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your business)
</em><br>
<p>I never said that. You are making up stuff. You are implying that I said 
<br>
that I myself want the choice of hiring cheap immigrant labor, but no one 
<br>
else can.  Why stop there? I am sure there are many other things you can 
<br>
make up.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;but not the costs (possibility of having to compete against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the cheaper worker). This is an eminently personal point of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An impartial analysis would look for maximizing the average and total
</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefit to the average and all Americans, while assuring that no &quot;partner 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;business&quot; has to bear the brunt of the costs without reaping any benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the immigrants are as good as possible in their ability to generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economic and scientific advances (meaning - better than the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American), the first of the above conditions would be satisfied. There 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be maximum benefit to the business owners who would be able to produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cheaper and better, and to their customers, who would get better prices and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;products. The overall improvement in labor efficiency would greatly exceed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any losses due to the changes brought about by the restructuring of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just as the introduction of information technologies allowed the economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth of the eighties and nineties, benefitting almost everybody despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destroying millions of (now useless) jobs. As long as significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unemployment does not develop, due to excessively fast changes, the costs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such restructuring would not be unduly focused on one subgroup of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population, satisfying the other condition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Both you as a business owner and you as an employee would be satisfied with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the outcome.
