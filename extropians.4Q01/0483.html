</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, the original ObExtroContent might have been weak, but the issue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanoeconomics is interesting. Remember that it is unlikely that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NanoClaus will appear instantly after the first assembler is made, so we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to be looking at an economy in a big transition over a span of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several years at least.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>My question was not so much of the fact that the transition from
<br>
first assembler to full NT production and economy would be full
<br>
of difficulties.  What I questioned was that tangent from off
<br>
the URL given which is about repurcussions of 911.  The two are
<br>
very different phenomenon with very different causes and
<br>
inherent possibilities.  The changes due to increased technology
<br>
and its effects in getting from here to there are indeed one of
<br>
my favorite
<br>
and I believe one of the most significant topics we need to deal
<br>
with.  But I think it would be better to deal with it on its own
<br>
considerable merits without piggybacking on 911 incensed
<br>
economic woes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wonder if Francis Fukuyama's thoughts on the industrial-postindustrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transition in _The Great Disruption_ would be applicable here? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens when the paradigm shifts occur more and more often, so that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system has not the time to settle down?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I have only begun to read his work thanks to this reference. 
<br>
But his views certainly are relevant.  The challenge of building
<br>
systems that are resilent during constant major changes is
<br>
great.  I do not think any off-the-shelf current socio-economic
<br>
systems are sufficient to the task.  It will be a great
<br>
discussion topic.
