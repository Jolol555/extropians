<p>Modern science is different. But when you deal with fundamental
<br>
questions the physical &quot;reality&quot; is &quot;veiled&quot;, now and then [1, 2].
<br>
<p>Sometimes philosophers (of science) make some big mistake.
<br>
In example ....
<br>
<p>&quot;Empedocles (and with him all others who used the same
<br>
forms of expression) was wrong in speaking of light as
<br>
`travelling' or being at a given moment between the earth
<br>
and its envelope [universe], its movement being unobservable to us;
<br>
that view is contrary both to the clear evidence of argument
<br>
and to the observed facts; if the distance traversed were
<br>
short, the movement might have been unobservable, but where
<br>
the distance is from extreme East to extreme West, the strain
<br>
upon our powers of belief is too great.&quot;
<br>
- Aristotle, &quot;On the Soul&quot;, Book II, 418-b.
<br>
<p>But sometimes they (philosophers and foretellers) are inspired.
<br>
In example ..... Leibniz was a convinced advocate of a Eurasian
<br>
policy and published a collection of documents on China (&quot;Novissima
<br>
Sinica&quot;,1679). Father Joachim Bouvet, who had been in China,
<br>
wrote Leibniz [3, 4] a letter in which he described the &quot;I Ching&quot; and
<br>
sent him a reproduction of the system (in the Fu-hsi ordering).
<br>
Leibniz recognized in the enigmatic hexagrams representations of
<br>
the progression of natural numbers in binary digits: his binary digits.
<br>
To demonstrate this he wrote &quot;Explication de l'Arithmétique Binaire&quot; (1705).
<br>
The &quot;I Ching&quot; was important for its divinatory contents, but for Leibniz it
<br>
becomes further evidence in proving the universal value of his formal
<br>
calculus. He was also convinced that his calculus has a divine
<br>
foundation, as it reflects the dialectic between God (1) and
<br>
Nothingness (0) . In a letter to Father Bouvet he suggests that its
<br>
inventor was Hermes Trismegistus. As a matter of fact, Fu-hsi, the
<br>
legendary inventor of the hexagrams, like Hermes, was considered
<br>
the father of all inventions.

&quot;Quantum Theory: A Pointer To An Independent Reality&quot;
<br>
While philosophy of science is the study of problems of knowledge concerning
<br>
science in general, there also exists - or should exist - a '' philosophy in science''
<br>
directed at finding out in what ways our actual scientific knowledge may validly
<br>
contribute to the basic philosophical quest. Contrary to philosophy of science,
<br>
which is a subject for philosophers, philosophy in science calls on the services
<br>
of physicists. When, in its spirit, quantum theory and Bell's theorem are used
<br>
as touchstones, the two main traditional philosophical approaches, realism and
<br>
idealism, are found wanting. A more suitable conception seems to be an
<br>
intermediate one, in which the mere postulated existence of a holistic and
<br>
hardly knowable Mind-Independent Reality is found to have an explaining power.
