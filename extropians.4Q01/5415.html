<em>&gt; Kai, I agree that scary people are scary. Tanked-up Hell's Angels on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amphetamines bumping into me at a bar are really scary, and I don't like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea of seeing even one of them with a gun in his (or her) hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we have a baseline of agreement, yes? People (you and I, at least)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer feeling safer to feeling less safe. Onward!
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if you got my point.
<br>
(1) I wouldn't feel safe with _anyone_ in that bar carrying a gun, not even 
<br>
you or me. Why? Because one of the &quot;ordinary&quot; persons could feel so 
<br>
&quot;empowered&quot; to escalate the situation. 
<br>
(2) I wouldn't feel safe if someone would always carry a Molotov Cocktail 
<br>
either, because this would (from my view) also be a sign of a fearful and 
<br>
potential dangerous person. 
<br>
(3) I am talking from my perspective here in Germany, where we'd rather 
<br>
call the police than try to play the hero. (cf. Sting: &quot;Englishman In New 
<br>
York&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My point about the homicidal man who went back to the club with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollar's worth of gasoline is: gee, if he'd had a gun handy he might have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shot his girlfriend, and maybe himself and a few other people, instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burning down a building and killing 87.
</em><br>
<p>This case is one of the ca. 15,500 homicides in the US and not an example 
<br>
of successful self-defense. The crime rate in the USA is 2 to 8 times 
<br>
higher than in Europe. If the rates here would be as high, I'd just say 
<br>
this is the price of freedom, but they are not. _My_ question therefore is: 
<br>
&quot;what are the differences between Europe and the USA that make so many more 
<br>
people act violent&quot;, not &quot;how can we stop a lunatic in a society of 
<br>
violence&quot;.
<br>
<p>See, I don't accept that a free and liberal society has to be so dangerous 
<br>
that their citizens only feel safe when they carry a deadly weapon.
<br>
<p>(BTW, <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/weapons.htm">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/weapons.htm</a> suggests that 
<br>
handguns in the hand of &lt;25 year old persons are the highest risk. IMO, 
<br>
this has something to do with &quot;feeling empowered&quot; rather than &quot;feeling more 
<br>
responsible&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The following comment is a cultural one, not a racist one (sad that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to say that):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The occupants of the place were mostly Dominicans, the man who set the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torch was Puerto Rican. So there might have been some culture mismatch;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other major dance club fire ever set in the US and Territories was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Puerto Rico; perhaps a Puerto Rican crowd would have read the man as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potent threat.
</em><br>
<p>I have heard this argument before: &quot;The minorities&quot; are far more violent 
<br>
and criminal than the rest. (I won't discuss prejudices of the police and 
<br>
justice here) It is sad to say that the numbers seem to confirm this 
<br>
theory, in the US as well as here.
<br>
<p>Someone also suggested that the reason for the different crime rates is the 
<br>
inhomogeneity(?) of the US society compared to a more homogeneous Europe. 
<br>
Hm. But the &quot;majority&quot; also consists of former minorities, here as well as 
<br>
in the US, correct? Unless you propose that the &quot;new minorities&quot; are 
<br>
intrinsically more violent than the &quot;old&quot;, what magic turned a mixture of 
<br>
minorities into a homogeneous, peaceful, law abiding majority?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ***
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Q5: What magic is there that transforms an ordinary person into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trustworthy one? ***
</em><br>
<p>I think this question explains the difference between us... My experience 
<br>
is that more than 99.99% of the &quot;ordinary persons&quot; here are non-violent 
<br>
persons. Trustworthy in the sense that they won't rob or kill me, even if 
<br>
they could. Lunatics and violent persons are a very small minority. So, my 
<br>
default assumption is &quot;non-violent until proven different&quot; (which doesn't 
<br>
imply that I leave my house or my car unlocked, though). If you'd say that 
<br>
this standard assumption is different in the US, then we might have one of 
<br>
the soft factors (or a symptom of it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my point of view, I'd rather ask it the other way: 
</em><br>
<p>(2) What evil magic transforms an ordinary person into a mass-murderer?
<br>
<p>(1) (the even more interesting question) How can we all (every person on 
<br>
this planet) live together when we cannot risk that anyone is so 
<br>
&quot;disgruntled&quot; that he starts a mass-killing with some &quot;empowering&quot; 
<br>
technology?
