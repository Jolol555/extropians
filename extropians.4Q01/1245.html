Smarter Web Update

<br>
You can't have a Semantic Web without metadata, but metadata alone won't
<br>
suffice. The metadata in Web pages will have to be linked to special documents
<br>
that define metadata terms and the relationships between the terms. These sets
<br>
of shared concepts and their interconnections are called &quot;ontologies.&quot;
<br>
<p>Say, for example, that you've made a Web page listing the members of a
<br>
faculty. You would tag the names of the different members with metadata terms
<br>
such as &quot;chair,&quot; &quot;associate professor,&quot; &quot;professor&quot; and so on. Then you'd link
<br>
the page to an ontology-one that you created yourself or one that someone else
<br>
has already made-that defines educational job positions and how they relate to
<br>
each other. An appropriate ontology would in this case define a chair as a
<br>
person, not a thing you sit on, and it would indicate that a chair is the most
<br>
senior position in a department.
<br>
<p>By defining the relationships between terms, ontologies can then be used by
<br>
applications to infer new facts. Suppose you have created a Web page that
<br>
teaches schoolchildren about condors, and have added metadata to the content.
<br>
You could link to an ontology (or more likely, several ontologies) that define
<br>
the various terms and their relationships: &quot;California condor is a type of
<br>
condor from California.&quot; &quot;Condor is a member of the raptor family.&quot; &quot;All
<br>
raptors are carnivores.&quot; &quot;California is a state in the United States.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Carnivores are meat eaters.&quot; By using both metadata and ontologies, a search
<br>
engine or other software agent could find your condor site based on a search
<br>
request for &quot;carnivores in the U.S.&quot;-even if your site made no mention of
<br>
carnivores or the United States.
<br>
<p>Because ontology development is a big undertaking, it's likely that site
<br>
creators will link to third-party ontologies. Some will be free, others will
<br>
be sold or licensed. One issue that will have to be confronted: just as with
<br>
dictionaries and atlases, political and cultural bias will creep into
<br>
ontologies. A geography-based ontology maintained by the Chinese government,
<br>
for instance, would probably not define Taiwan as a &quot;country.&quot;
<br>
<p>But that hardly impedes the vision. As the World Wide Web Consortium continues
<br>
to develop standards and technologies for the Semantic Web, hundreds of
<br>
organizations, companies and individuals are contributing to the effort by
<br>
creating tools, languages and ontologies.
<br>
<p>One major contributor is DARPA-the folks responsible for a great deal of the
<br>
technology behind the Internet (see &quot;DARPA's Disruptive Technologies,&quot; TR
<br>
October 2001). These days, DARPA is contributing tens of millions of dollars
<br>
to the Web consortium's Semantic Web project and has developed a semantic
<br>
language for the U.S. Department of Defense called DARPA Agent Markup Language
<br>
that allows users to add metadata to Web documents and relate it to
<br>
ontologies. University of Maryland computer science professor Jim Hendler-who
<br>
was until August manager of the DARPA program-has been working closely with
<br>
Berners-Lee and Miller to ensure consistency with the consortium's efforts.
<br>
Last December, Hendler announced the creation of a language that combines the
<br>
DARPA Agent Markup Language's capabilities with an ontology language,
<br>
developed in Europe, called OIL (which stands for both Ontology Inference
<br>
Layer and Ontology Interchange Language).
<br>
<p>A developer of this new language, University of Manchester lecturer Ian
<br>
Horrocks, also advises the World Wide Web Consortium on the Semantic Web. In
<br>
January, he cofounded a company called Network Inference to develop technology
<br>
that uses ontologies and automated inference to give Semantic Web capabilities
<br>
to existing relational databases and large Web sites. Recently, an Isle of
<br>
Man-based data services company called PDMS began using Network Inference's
<br>
technology to add Semantic Web capabilities to corporate databases. Dozens of
<br>
other companies, from Hewlett-Packard to Nokia, are contributing to Semantic
<br>
Web development
<br>
<p>Too Much, Too Late?
<br>
Miller believes the seamless flow and integration of information resulting
<br>
from these moves will make it possible to process knowledge in a way &quot;that
<br>
solves problems, brings people closer and spurs on new ideas that never could
<br>
happen before.&quot; Others, though, are not so optimistic about the Semantic Web.
<br>
&quot;It's rather ambitious,&quot; says R. V. Guha, who led development of the Web
<br>
consortium's Resource Description Framework efforts in the late 1990s. (This
<br>
framework is an essential tool for describing and sharing metadata.) &quot;It would
<br>
be nice if such things existed,&quot; he says, &quot;but there are some really hard
<br>
research problems that need to be solved first.&quot;
<br>
<p>One issue concerns inference. The time it takes a computer to draw new
<br>
conclusions from data, metadata and ontologies on the Web increases rapidly as
<br>
rules are added to a system. Inference falls into the same category as the
<br>
classic &quot;traveling-salesman problem&quot; of planning the shortest route through a
<br>
number of cities. It's not hard to figure out the best of all possible routes
<br>
when you're dealing with just a very few locations. But when you get up to
<br>
only 15 cities, there are more than 43 billion possible routes. The same kind
<br>
of runaway situation exists for inference, where brute-force searches for
<br>
answers could lead to time-wasting paradoxes or contradictions.
<br>
<p>And even if Berners-Lee and his cohorts meet the technical challenges, that
<br>
won't be enough for the Semantic Web to click into place. There is a big
<br>
question as to whether people will think the benefits are worth the extra
<br>
effort of adding metadata to their content in the first place. One reason the
<br>
Web became so wildly successful, after all, was its sublime ease of creation.
<br>
<p>&quot;The Web today is the simplest, most primitive form of hypertext,&quot; says former
<br>
Sun Microsystems Distinguished Engineer Jakob Nielsen, cofounder of the
<br>
Nielsen Norman Group, a Web design firm in Fremont, CA. &quot;And that's why it was
<br>
so easy to implement; that's why everybody could...start putting up their own
<br>
Web pages; that's why the Web is so big.&quot; However, while most people may be
<br>
comfortable doing simplistic editing, such as marking a text as &quot;bold,&quot;
<br>
Nielsen points out, &quot;They cannot do semantic editing, where they say, 'This is
<br>
the author's name,' or 'This is the name of people I'm quoting.'&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, such pessimism may be ignoring recent history. Not so long ago, the
<br>
notion of millions of people learning to write HTML code seemed
<br>
far-fetched-yet that's exactly what happened. Still, the hurdle of creating a
<br>
Semantic Web will be higher. People can use HTML any way they want. They
<br>
commonly use tables for nontabular purposes, for instance, and slap on the
<br>
&quot;subhead&quot; tag merely to apply boldface. These kluges and shortcuts usually
<br>
have only cosmetic consequences. But the same type of fudging-say, by
<br>
employing &quot;bibliography&quot; tags to list a DVD collection-could make a page's
<br>
metadata unusable.
<br>
<p>The fact that metadata wasn't implemented right from the Web's start could
<br>
also make it harder for the Semantic Web to gain acceptance. One particularly
<br>
tough skeptic is Peter Merholz, cofounder of Adaptive Path, a San
<br>
Francisco-based user experience consultancy. &quot;This stuff has to be baked in
<br>
from the beginning,&quot; says Merholz, who calls the Semantic Web &quot;an interesting
<br>
academic pursuit&quot; with little bearing on society. &quot;The Semantic Web is getting
<br>
a lot of hype simply because Tim Berners-Lee-the inventor of the World Wide
<br>
Web-is so interested in it,&quot; he says. &quot;If it were just some schmuck at some
<br>
university in Indiana, nobody would care.&quot;
<br>
<p>Initial Threads
<br>
Even Berners-Lee admits that the path to the Semantic Web may be a bit slower
<br>
than that to the World Wide Web. &quot;In a way we don't need to move too fast,&quot; he
<br>
says, &quot;because the theory people need to look at it to make sure we're not too
<br>
crazy, and other people need to check out the ideas in practice before they're
<br>
picked up and used too extensively.&quot;
<br>
<p>When asked to peek into his crystal ball, the evangelist of exchangeable data
<br>
predicts that some of the Semantic Web's first commercial applications will
<br>
aim to integrate the different information systems that typically coexist in
<br>
large organizations. (Wouldn't it be nice to take care of business at the
<br>
motor vehicle department or hospital without having to fill out a half-dozen
<br>
largely redundant forms? The Semantic Web can help here.)
<br>
<p>And even though the Semantic Web still resides chiefly on the drawing board,
<br>
you can see hints of its power on some existing Web sites. Consider Moreover
<br>
Technologies' search engine that crawls thousands of news sites several times
<br>
a day, making it a favorite for news junkies. Moreover's software agents have
<br>
been programmed to look at the font tags (the HTML labels that tell Web
<br>
browsers how large or small to make the text appear on the screen) to
<br>
determine whether or not a particular page is a news story. If a Moreover
<br>
agent finds a string of six to 18 words tagged as large type near the top of a
<br>
page, it will assume it is a headline and place it in a database. Of course,
<br>
since the agent is only making a guess, sometimes it selects a page that isn't
<br>
news after all. So Moreover has to apply additional filtering to get rid of
<br>
pages that don't contain articles.
<br>
<p>That's still a far cry from the ultimate goal-but it's a good start. And even
<br>
the Semantic Web champions don't pretend to grasp exactly where such steps
<br>
will lead. After all, who predicted Amazon.com or eBay back when Berners-Lee
<br>
turned on the switch of the world's first Web server in December 1990?
<br>
<p>But the point is that people want more intelligence from the Web than they're
<br>
getting-and a growing number of computer scientists share the twinkle in
<br>
Berners-Lee's eye, and the feeling that the Semantic Web holds the answer.
<br>
&quot;It's great,&quot; says the inventor of the World Wide Web, &quot;to have that
<br>
grass-roots enthusiasm around again.&quot;
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
