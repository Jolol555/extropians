<p>Thank you kindly. I'd just like to emphasize the difference between me
<br>
and the garden variety conspiracy theorist. That is, I don't believe
<br>
that conspiracies are infallible or monolithic. If you pardon me for
<br>
quoting myself, this bears repeating:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;...whichever has the best cost:benefit ratio in a given situation. The only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;things saving our butts are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;	a) nobler individuals who came before us in our respective countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;	   who crafted institutions resistant (but never immune) to cooptation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;	b) power elites are domain specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;	c) the agendae of power elites often conflict with each other (at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;	   moment, Islamic theocrats vs. secular corporatists)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;	d) the actions power elites take to further their own power are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;	   subject to the same imperfect information and unintended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;	   consequences that confound the actions of humans in general.
</em><br>
<p><p>Nor are all conspiracies necesserily intentional. For instance, is
<br>
there a massive conspiracy of white people to oppress people of color?
<br>
No, but there is collusion going on, an emergent effect of biases that
<br>
(by this point in history) can be so subtle as to avoid detection on
<br>
the individual level. Ditto the collusion of men against women, women
<br>
against men, any group against any other group. If these conspiracies
<br>
were intentional, it's a virtual certainty that with a shared secret
<br>
involving so many individuals, somebody would spill the beans.
