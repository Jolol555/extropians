<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But where is the admission from all these people who are worshipping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism (please, let's be honest!) that a relatively small fraction of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the population stands to gain tremendously from having the poulation in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrall the capitalism-worship?  I just don't see that!  And I know, just as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure as water downhill, that those dynamics exist. And likewise, I also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, with the same certainty, that there exist very serious conflicts of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest between those who have, and who have significantly less.  Where is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the admission of this obvious fact?
</em><br>
<p>You can't &quot;admit&quot; what you don't believe.  I sincerely believe that you
<br>
are mistaken, probably because your operating definition of &quot;capitalism&quot;
<br>
is very different from what most of us free-marketers really believe in;
<br>
you probably think that the present US system is capitalist, while most
<br>
of us think it has a long way to go to become a truly free market with
<br>
proper respect and enforcement of everyone's rights--including those of
<br>
the poor.  A lot of people who attack what they call &quot;capitalists&quot;, for
<br>
example, just assume that capitalists would favor right-to-work laws, for
<br>
example, that libertarians in fact oppose.  They assume that trade unions
<br>
are anti-capitalist, when in fact they are a fine capitalist concept.
<br>
Most assume that capitalists support intellectual property, when that
<br>
issue is orthogonal.
<br>
<p>Once we agree on what we're talking about, productive discussion might
<br>
become possible (assuming those doing the discussing are themselves
<br>
capable of rational thought).
<br>
<p>Another problem I see frequently in your arguents is that you refer to
<br>
&quot;common sense&quot; or &quot;common knowledge&quot; or &quot;obvious&quot; observations.  Common
<br>
sense and other prejudices are a handy substitute for real thought
<br>
sometimes in a pinch, but when actually measurable, demonstrable data
<br>
are available, they should be thrown out the window.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure whether rational discussion of these things is possible
<br>
with you--but you're here, so obviously you share some goals and ideas.
<br>
But if you think you have a better understanding of what kinds of
<br>
economic systems would help us reach our goals, you're going to have
<br>
to do a much better job of expressing those ideas than you have been.
<br>
Of course, I happen to think even then that you'll fail, not because
<br>
we aren't listening, but because your side doesn't have much to say
<br>
that isn't just empty emotional rhetoric.  But anything's possible.
