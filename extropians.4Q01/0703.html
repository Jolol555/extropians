<p>Yes, but you don't need entangled particles. One electron
<br>
is enough, as pointed out by L. de Broglie (1959).
<br>
<p>de Broglie's paradox.
<br>
<p>Consider a box B with *reflecting* walls.
<br>
The box B can be divided in two boxes B1, B2 
<br>
by a double sliding reflecting partition. Initially the 
<br>
box B contains an electron. Then the box B is divided 
<br>
into B1 (taken to Paris) and B2 (taken to Tokyo).
<br>
The new situation is described by 2 w.f., one defined
<br>
in the volume V(B1), the other in the volume V(B2).
<br>
The original w.f. was defined in volume V(B).
<br>
Let's be P(B1) the probability for finding the 
<br>
electron in B1 and P(B2) the probability for finding 
<br>
the electron in B2. Before measurement, for QM, our
<br>
electron is in B1 *and* in B2. After measurement
<br>
our electron is in B1 *or* in B2. In detail. An observation
<br>
is performed in Paris at time T_0 and the electron is
<br>
found in B1. For T &gt; T_0 the probability P(B2) of
<br>
observing the electron in B2 (in Tokyo) must be zero.
<br>
But P(B2) is given by the integral over V(B2) of the
<br>
squared modulus of the w.f. in V(B2). Thus the vanishing
<br>
of P(B2), at T &gt; T_0, implies the vanishing of the
<br>
w.f. in V(B2). 
<br>
<p>Most physicists would say that the electron observed in Paris
<br>
at T_0 was *already* there. And that those 2 w.f. represented
<br>
just our *knowledge* prior to that observation. 
<br>
<p>Note that de Broglie's paradox exists only for physicists
<br>
who insist on a realistic philosophy (particles exist
<br>
objectively) and not for positivists (it makes no sense 
<br>
to talk about an un-observed particle).
