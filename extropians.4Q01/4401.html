<em>&gt; Too bad they don't tell us what this great discovery is.  They mention

</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is so much hype in the technology sector today, that I just assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these kinds of things are false until proven otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. If I had come up with some super-clever general neural network
<br>
solution, I would sell it as a black box or hire out consultants to
<br>
help embedd it into other systems. If I had come up with something very
<br>
cool-sounding but less useful, I would (assuming I wanted to make money
<br>
on it) probably try to earn money by selling the hype - for example by
<br>
selling expensive courses in my hype technology. If you have paid $50K
<br>
for a course in a technology that turns out to be less useful than you
<br>
expected, it is human nature to downplay your disappointment and say it
<br>
is great - few will loudly say it is junk. 
<br>
<p>So far neural networks have not been a commercial success as standalone
<br>
products; the networks that really are useful and do earn money are all
<br>
embedded in other products. Neural network chips have been developed,
<br>
but so far none have been commercially viable. With FPGA
<br>
performance/price increases it seems likely there will be more hardware
<br>
implemented ANNs soon (there is a great deal of interest in that in my
<br>
research group, at least).
