Subject: Interview for all Extropians
<br>
<p><p>Hello Extropian crew:
<br>
Below are some questions I originally submitted to T.O. Morrow.  If anyone
<br>
would like to add their own replies to my questions, please do so under each
<br>
T.O. Morrow entry.  A bio of each contributor would also be appreciated.
<br>
Samples are provided below.  If this mega-interview is successful, there is
<br>
a
<br>
very good chance that C-Theory (&lt;A
<br>
HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.ctheory.net/">http://www.ctheory.net/</a>&quot;&gt;www.ctheory.net&lt;/A&gt;) will publish this online
<br>
as
<br>
they are about to publish 2 of my other interviews.
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
Jeremy Turner (scroll down for the interview)…
<br>
<p>QUESTIONS:
<br>
<p>JEREMY: As far as current paradigms go, it has been a pet-peeve of mine to
<br>
see critiques of Virtual Reality constantly tied to the limits posed by
<br>
“immersion”.  For example, in the seminal work “DataTrash” by Arthur and
<br>
Marilouise Kroker, virtualization is seen as a process where the physical
<br>
properties of the flesh are consumed or “harvested” into a partial and
<br>
incomplete reality.  In a sense, one would become immersed in a space that
<br>
is
<br>
not equally co-existing with reality.  Therefore, some critics are saying
<br>
that virtualization initially seduces the body through its promise of
<br>
(immersive) escapism but eventually degrades the physical integrity of
<br>
meatspace by retreating into a false and secondary reality.  Even today, new
<br>
realities being built by developing and speculative technologies are being
<br>
confused with having exclusively immersive properties.  An Extropian example
<br>
that comes to mind is the dream of uploading our minds into an immersed
<br>
collective-super-conscious entity. As far as I understand, this is still a
<br>
desirable Extropian vision.
<br>
<p>TOMORROW: Though I cannot pretend to speak for every self-proclaimed
<br>
Extropian, I for one do not aim at Borganization.  I certainly aim to change
<br>
and grow, understand; I do not aim to obliterate my individuality, however.
<br>
Mark: There are two quite distinct questions here: whether we will loose an
<br>
essential aspect of ourselves if we loose &quot;meat embodiment&quot; and the question
<br>
of individual identity. The Borg of course are meat creatures with a
<br>
collective identity, the denizens of the virtual world of The Matrix are
<br>
individuals with virtual bodies. The idea that virtual reality is a &quot;false
<br>
and secondary&quot; reality is an ontological prejudice. What is true is that
<br>
technology promises to allow any number of experiments in living and
<br>
experiments in identity.
<br>
JEREMY: Has “immersion” become synonymous with “evolution”?  If not, do you
<br>
see the possibility that our definition of the world “virtual” is at this
<br>
point narrow and that a future VR will include extroverted realities that
<br>
harmonize with the“real” rather than harvest it?
<br>
<p>TOMORROW:  I recognize the possibility that you describe--that virtual
<br>
realities will always retain links with external meatspace.  And, indeed, I
<br>
regard purely virtual realities as more a theoretical possibility than a
<br>
likely eventuality.  But at any rate, your question concerns conditions at
<br>
too far a remove to allow very confident claims.
<br>
MARK: The short answer is no. Transhumanists and Extropians generally
<br>
concentrate on nanotechnology and AI but evolution may take place initially,
<br>
or concurrently via genetic engineering. Imagine, for instance, a creature
<br>
with a brain and intelligence that stands to ours as ours does to a chimp's.
<br>
Genetic engineering experiments were done on frog zygotes about 5 years ago
<br>
that resulted in frogs with larger brains. There is no technological reason
<br>
why same sorts of experiments could be done this year on humans--we have
<br>
analogues of the same sorts of genes done in the frog experiments. Those
<br>
with a meat preference might opt for this course of evolution.
<br>
<p><p>JEREMY: As of today (November 08, 2001), I have heard the news that the
<br>
first
<br>
single-molecule transistor has been developed by Bell Labs (a division of
<br>
Lucent Technologies).  From hearing this news, I am reminded of a prediction
<br>
by Wired Magazine (I think in 1998) that if we progress according to plan,
<br>
we
<br>
will have the first commercial nano-assembler on the market by 2004.  Given
<br>
the current rate of technological benchmarks and breakthroughs, do you think
<br>
that such a prediction by Wired may still be accurate?
<br>
<p>TOMORROW:  No, I would not bet on that prediction.
<br>
MARK: Possible, but not probable.
<br>
&nbsp;JEREMY:  Given this, what do you think will be the first commercial
<br>
applications of the assembler?  Do you envision any immediate
<br>
artistic/cultural/aesthetic applications of the assembler once it is on the
<br>
market?
<br>
<p>TOMORROW:  I predict the first assemblers will work mainly on materials
<br>
manufacturing, since they offer a relatively easy first job.  For that
<br>
reason, I do not foresee any immediate culture effects--unless you include
<br>
recouping R&amp;D costs as part of culture!
<br>
&nbsp;MARK: I agree with Tomorrow that the first commercial applications will
<br>
likely be materials manufacturing. Assuming it is available to artists, I
<br>
imagine that there will be any number of artistic experiments with
<br>
nanotechnology--especially if the general consensus is that there will not
<br>
be any artistic/cultural/aesthetic applications! Imagine, for example, a
<br>
sculpture that was simultaneously being constructed by one set of nanobots
<br>
and disassembled by another. Parts of the sculpture would continuously
<br>
appear and disappear yet the whole sculpture would never be seen at once.
<br>
We'll call this exhibit entropy/extropy. (No, no I don't have any plans to
<br>
quite my day job). I imagine there will be some
<br>
protest pieces that call attention to the dangers of nanotechnology, e.g.,
<br>
the &quot;Black Goo&quot; piece might feature human figurines being disassembled by an
<br>
army of nanobots. The future for nanoart is so bright I think that artists
<br>
should heed the time honored advice and wear shades.
<br>
JEREMY: Here is an elaboration/extension on Question #2.  Since September
<br>
the
<br>
11th, there has been a lot of government money thrown towards the  U.S.
<br>
National Nanotechnology  Initiative and Nanotech startup companies such as
<br>
Zyvex  Corp. in Dallas.  Given the logic of the “trickle down effect”, when
<br>
do you see this technology filtering down from the Defense and Medical
<br>
priorities down to the level of the personal prosumer?
<br>
<p>TOMORROW:  I'm not really very well placed to make predictions on
<br>
timetables,
<br>
so I'll only venture a range from 2015-2050.
<br>
MARK: Indeed, there is room to speculate whether it will reach the hands of
<br>
the individual consumer in the foreseeable future. There are so many issues
<br>
here covering patents, patent enforcement and how we protect ourselves
<br>
against the potential dangers of nanotechnology. (Consider how long nuclear
<br>
technology has been around. We don't have personal reactors now, not just
<br>
because of the expense but because governments deem the technology too
<br>
dangerous).
<br>
<p>JEREMY:  The Foresight Institute has given a lot of attention to cautious
<br>
and
<br>
thoughtful discussions towards the practical and moral implications of
<br>
Nanotechnology but little foresight has happened with regards to discussions
<br>
dealing with the future of cultural discourse once this promised technology
<br>
has arrived..  At first glance, this may not seem too strange because the
<br>
immediate foresight necessarily needs to deal with issues that may mold or
<br>
destroy our environment totally.  However, the apparent lack of initiating
<br>
any active cultural thinktank devoted to foresight may be lacking foresight
<br>
itself as K. Eric Drexler  in his book “Engines of Creation” (1986) seemed
<br>
to suggest that the end-goal of Nanotechnology is to create a generation of
<br>
liberated  Performance Artists because Nanotechnology should in theory,
<br>
provide for all our material wants and needs.  The only thing left to
<br>
explore
<br>
and maintain would ultimately  be culture.  So, what importance do you place
<br>
the value of developing a creative thinktank at his time?  Or, do you think
<br>
it is best for the technology to arrive first before the context is
<br>
appropriate for thinking about the specific direction that creative
<br>
individuals will take?
<br>
<p>TOMORROW:  I think Foresight has taken the correct focus.  To try to predict
<br>
culture would at best waste time, and at worst fritter away resources better
<br>
spent on more concrete and preliminary matters.  The very nature of culture
<br>
renders it immune to prediction; it arises out of the interactions of free
<br>
individuals in a particular place and time.  We can only wait and see--with
<br>
great anticipation--what tomorrow's artists will create with
<br>
nanotechnological tools. I think Foresight has taken the correct focus.  To

<br>
Mark: I think a thinktank of perhaps broader scope is a good idea. Not just
<br>
nanotechnology but the other two members of the great triumvirate: AI and
<br>
genetic engineering. Unlike Tomorrow I am not sure that this endeavor would
<br>
ultimately draw away resources from the nano endeavor--indeed, it might
<br>
serve to attract resources. The question of these emerging technologies is
<br>
not just how to realize them but also, and perhaps more importantly, why.
<br>
What will these technologies mean for us as human beings?, as philosophers?,
<br>
as scientists?, as artists? These technologies promise to affect our lives
<br>
so significantly that there is no parallel in human history. Perhaps the
<br>
closest analogue is the emergence of Hominids from Australopithecines. I
<br>
think it is incumbent upon all of us to explore the question of the meaning
<br>
of these technologies. Artists can contribute today to this task by
<br>
exploring facets of this question through art. Let me give you one example
<br>
from art itself. Talk of the end of art has surfaced occasionally in Western
<br>
Culture since Hegel; most recently and famously the idea is associated with
<br>
the German art historian Hans Belting and the American philosopher Arthur
<br>
Danto. The idea, very roughly, is that art has explored all the conceptual
<br>
spaces possible: from the representational tradition of the Enlightenment
<br>
through Impressionism, Expressionism, Abstract Expression (etc.) so that art
<br>
has exhausted its possibilities. The idea of course is not that art will not
<br>
be made any more, it is simply that in a sense there can be no progress in
<br>
art. As an analogy think of the game of tic-tac-toe. The game is still
<br>
played, although there is no longer progress in the grand tradition of
<br>
tic-tac-toe--its conceptual possibilities have long been exhausted. The end
<br>
of art thesis says that art is like tic-tac-toe in this sense: the &quot;art
<br>
game&quot; will still be played but all new productions will be but variants on
<br>
themes already explored. I think that artist ought to explore the
<br>
possibility that Belting and Danto are too human, all too human, in their
<br>
thinking. Technology will allow us to redesign artists themselves, to make
<br>
them better artists. The art of our posthuman descendents may usher in a
<br>
whole new Renaissance of art. In any event, these are the sorts of questions
<br>
that your thinktank proposal might want to address.
