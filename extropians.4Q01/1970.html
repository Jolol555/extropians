<p><em>&gt;So if anyone has advice, whether about applying in general or about specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programs or schools to apply to, it'd be welcome.  As background, I've liked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hofstadter's type of work as expressed in _Fluid Concepts and Creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Analogies_, and Pinker's _How The Mind Works_ was a recent catalyst, towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;this is cool, damnit, I want to help&quot;.  My assets are a planetary science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;degree from Caltech, with a crappy GPA, and not much releated coursework,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;although I should be able to get a good GRE score.  So applying is a bit more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intimidating than when I was headed for undergraduate school as a high school
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prodigy
</em><br>
<p>I was in a similar situation.  I took relevant courses through University of 
<br>
California extension for 2 years, got straight A's, volunteered in a research 
<br>
lab for references, and aced the GREs.  With that, I breezed into grad school.
<br>
I'm sure I could have cut a year off my prep time but I was very low in 
<br>
confidence.
<br>
<p>In your current situation, I'd recommend prepping for the subject GRE's - get
<br>
a book and see how you do.  Use some kind of scientific literature search
<br>
to identify some people whose work you like (remember the well-known
<br>
people have more students to choose from).  Read, read, read the 
<br>
scientific literature.  Email some interesting profs, discuss 
<br>
their work, and see if they're interested in having you.  If you're really 
<br>
short on coursework, I'd recommend taking some; but if they really like
<br>
you you can get in with a lot of missing coursework; you'll just have to
<br>
take it when you get there.  Try to get some applications in this year.
<br>
Be upfront about your shortcomings but very clear that you will work
<br>
around them.  Ask in your application that they tell you what you will 
<br>
need to get in if they don't accept you this year. 
<br>
<p>Right now there's a real shortage of grad students relative to the demand
<br>
from the professors.  This is because the market for people *after* they
<br>
get their PhD is pretty poor.  So the bargaining is on your side; if they 
<br>
think
<br>
you'll do good research they will want you.
