</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How in the world is this 'security' frenzy going to help humans on this

</em><br>
<p>It will help by aiding in the repair the breach of trust created by the
<br>
attacks. The integrity of our open society has been riddled with holes
<br>
by several decades of pro-foreigner legislation that has steadily
<br>
dismantled the regulatory membrane that has protected our society from
<br>
penetration by concious and unconcious agents of fascism, looterism, and
<br>
repression. The barbarians are within the gates.
<br>
<p>The sort of libertarian society we would all like to live in is all fine
<br>
and dandy in principle, but such a society can only exist when the only
<br>
people permitted to enter that society are those who share a common
<br>
belief in the principles and institutions of that society (that is how
<br>
the 'trust' is created). Migration and free transit by anyone within
<br>
that society is a given, but allowing such a society to be penetrated
<br>
from without by anti-liberty forces will guarrantee its failure.
<br>
<p>It is unfortunate that we need to clamp down harder right now than would
<br>
otherwise be necessary, but its like a patient that is riddled with
<br>
cancer after a lifetime of irresponsible ingestion of toxic carcinogenic
<br>
agents: only drastic application of toxic chemotherapy and radiation
<br>
will cure the patient. Going soft on the body just because it hurts for
<br>
a little while only guarantees death.
