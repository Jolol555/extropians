Friends,
<br>
<p>--- Adrian Tymes &lt;<a href="mailto:wingcat@pacbell.net?Subject=Re:%20Could%20this%20be%20IT?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20011204071015.76070.qmail@web13509.mail.yahoo.com&gt;">wingcat@pacbell.net</a>&gt; wrote:

<p><em>&gt; Frankly, I fail to see what the excitement is about.

</em><br>
<p>Yeah, one that costs three grand!
<br>
<p>Okay, I don't like being a naysayer.  The price will
<br>
come down.  
<br>
<p>This item may make its inventor some money in specific
<br>
applications, but in the consumer market I don't see
<br>
the appeal.  Able-bodied people would rather use a
<br>
bike.  In fact, I'd like to see it go toe to toe with
<br>
a bike.  I'd guess that a bike is more maneuverable in
<br>
regard to turns, because it appears that on the Segway
<br>
you can't bank--lean as you turn.  The idea of
<br>
traveling at 12 or 17 MPH standing straight up,...is
<br>
just plain scary.  (Or else I see a market for a full
<br>
body airbag.)  If you slow down to walking speed, then
<br>
why is it exactly that you're on the thing?  Cause you
<br>
can't walk?  But you can stand?  Now the market begins
<br>
to narrow.
<br>
<p>When a person is standing, they better be moving their
<br>
legs--dancing, jumping, skipping, running, etc--or
<br>
they're in for circulatory discomfort in their legs.
<br>
<p>I applaud Mr. Kamen's devotion to technology, and what
<br>
he has accomplished here will certainly not go to
<br>
waste--the computerised and gyro-stabilized
<br>
self-balancing platform will end up being a step to
<br>
something worthwhile--but the Segway came out of the
<br>
build-a-better-wheel-chair project, and needs people
<br>
who can't walk to be more than a plaything.
<br>
<p>Kamen needs someone from ExI to show him the way. 
<br>
Macro-scale machine self-replication, that's the
<br>
ticket.  This is just such a waste of talent.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;Enjoying being insulting is a youthful corruption of
<br>
power. You lose your taste for it when you realize how
<br>
hard people try, how much they mind, and how long they
<br>
remember.&quot;
