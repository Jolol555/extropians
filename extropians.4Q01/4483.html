This is a long and somewhat difficult post, but I believe it discusses an
<br>
important issue.

<p><em>&gt;For example, the Sufi traveler belongs to a 'tariqa'. This word

<p><em>&gt;I have no argument against the Sufi presentation of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Going back to the &quot;real&quot; definitions of things, it seems to

</em><br>
<p>This whole approach to cognitive/emotional understanding and communication,
<br>
while immensely appealing and poetic, is also incredibly risky.
<br>
<p>One of the great benefits of poststructuralism in the humanities during the
<br>
last few decades has been its relentlessly corrosive analysis of
<br>
`essentialist' thinking, even as it has managed to perform exactly the same
<br>
error in much of its own discourse. `Essences' are the alleged `things in
<br>
themselves', the supposed ontologically prior inward forms that precede
<br>
merely superficial or accidental approximations (things, you and me) to
<br>
these pure structures. That's too vast a topic to address in a few words,
<br>
but I'll try to convey my disquiet with a few quotes from my book THEORY
<br>
AND ITS DISCONTENTS:
<br>
<p>---------
<br>
One of the attractions of rhymed verse, for instance, is the pleasure we
<br>
obtain from identifying recurrent patterns of repetition in the prosody and
<br>
the rhymed words - a satisfaction itself presumably as hard-wired in source
<br>
as a baby's fear of falling over edges, or its desire to suck. This
<br>
gratification lends itself all too readily to the erroneous theory,
<br>
endlessly adopted, that words which sound alike reflect a deeper similarity
<br>
of `essence'. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most curious feature of the `uncanny' tendency in avowedly
<br>
anti-essentialist theory is its devotion to puns - not merely for the
<br>
jouissance of activating this primitive categorical induction machine, but
<br>
in blurring poetical and rational procedures. The effect is numbing and
<br>
even corrupting. Theorists dote on mock-diacritical gags like (M)other,
<br>
In(ter)vention, Co-HERE-ence, and so forth. If the Hesse net model is
<br>
plausible, one can see how psychoanalytically charged puns are generated
<br>
(and perhaps repressed in self-protection). In a famous passage, Rousseau
<br>
reports how he accepted a morsel of food from his mother's mouth, at once
<br>
`foreign and indifferent (un cheveu) and his own desire (un je veux)'
<br>
(Culler, 1982, p. 105). We regard with satisfaction Rousseau's
<br>
homonymy-laden swallowing of his beloved Maman's metonymic morsel. But the
<br>
deconstructive relish for pseudo-insight spills from the poetic into the
<br>
silly when we start worrying at Hegel-aigle, the lofty philosopher eagle,
<br>
and Genêt-genêt, the criminal flower (p. 136). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This preparedness to find revelations in the fall of unmotivated words can
<br>
breed witty but deeply misleading analyses.[...]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poisons and Parasites
<br>
<p>Theory's premier analysts (especially Derrida, de Man, Hartman, Hillis
<br>
Miller) delight in unpicking single terms, in showing how clusters of
<br>
meanings imbricate each another: that a medicine is a poison (Derrida,
<br>
1981), that a host is a parasite (Hillis Miller, 1979). Some of these moves
<br>
are no more compelling than adolescent puns. Some uncover philological
<br>
tracks which show how metaphors pick up and draw to our attention
<br>
apparently inconsistent features of our experience, that paradoxical
<br>
conceits fade through overuse into one-sided cliche and later into
<br>
deforming reification. Others are simply culture-bound, as highly prized
<br>
`insights' from French sages can reveal, comically:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cixous says, `It is no accident that voler has the meanings to steal and
<br>
to fly.' But surely it is an accident, as is demonstrated by the facts that
<br>
no comparable connection exists in English. (Green, 1988, p. 146)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider Derrida's famous analysis of pharmakon in Plato (Derrida, 1981).
<br>
Because the human body is a homeostatic organic system that controls its
<br>
workings largely by shunting around neurotransmitters, certain quantities
<br>
of neurotoxins of the same biochemical effectivity can assist the metabolic
<br>
cycle in a sick person or disrupt that of a healthy person. This ambiguity
<br>
of function, known in its effects to the practical Greeks, serves Derrida
<br>
nicely as he stands at the counter of Plato's pharmacy, but on his own
<br>
argument the suspicion cannot be dispelled that he himself is peddling
<br>
snake-oil.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Derrida's case is that philosophical language, meant to be the adjudicator
<br>
of rational debate, is not only riddled with inconsistencies - being built,
<br>
as we have agreed, of woolly bundles - but that any attempt to suppress or
<br>
sublate them serves only to mystify us. His general ground for this claim,
<br>
criticized above, is that the principle of non-contradiction is a
<br>
repressive instrument rather than, as Popper showed, a sine qua non of
<br>
discourse. In the Phaedo, taking his death by poison, Socrates asks that a
<br>
cock be sacrificed to Asclepius: a sardonic touch, one might suppose, since
<br>
this is the traditional price to the gods for recovery from mortal illness.
<br>
But, as Bertrand Russell (1961) succinctly puts it, in perishing, `Socrates
<br>
has recovered from life's fitful fever' (p. 155). Of course, as Russell
<br>
stresses, this conceit is an expression of mystical loathing for the
<br>
`slavery to the body and its needs'(p. 152) - a characteristic weakness, it
<br>
might be remarked, of philosophers, mathematicians and computer hackers. So
<br>
life is `healed' by the poison which ends it, just as a pharmakon can cure
<br>
or harm.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This natural bipolar effect is employed by Plato's Socrates and Derrida as
<br>
a figure of ambiguity for writing: remedy for memory's failings, destroyer
<br>
of speech's supposed immediacy and presence. Beyond this adventitious pun
<br>
lie others: pharmakeus, the imprisoned wonderworker; pharmakos, the
<br>
scapegoat who carries away out of the city those corrupt elements which its
<br>
provenance at once betrays and cleanses. Pretty as these games undoubtedly
<br>
are, there is only doubtful ontological value in studying verbal
<br>
ambiguities founded in ignorance, magic and accident, beyond the necessary
<br>
reminder that our own understanding of the world (and of ourselves) is
<br>
forever provisional, incomplete, internally incoherent in ways we can never
<br>
quite identify.
<br>
<p>...............
<br>
<p>Walter Kaufmann neatly summarized Heidegger's lexical approach to the
<br>
ground (Grund) of Being: `He speaks of ergrunden (fathom) and Grundung
<br>
(foundation) and distinguishes between Ur-grund (primal ground), Ab-grund
<br>
(abyss) and Un-grund (bottomlessness?)... The piling up of words with the
<br>
same root - one of the most characteristic devices of Heidegger's style -
<br>
induces a spurious sense of illumination, an unfounded conviction that
<br>
something has been explained' (Kaufmann, 1960, pp. 345-6). Unsympathetic
<br>
critics go further. George Steiner (who is more generous, for reasons that
<br>
fail to persuade me) characterizes their response to Heidegger's eccentric
<br>
method:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Even] a polemical discussion of Heidegger's method is merely futile. His
<br>
writings are a thicket of impenetrable verbiage; the questions he poses are
<br>
sham questions.... To try to analyzes Heideggerian `ontology'... is to
<br>
speak, or to speak of, nonsense - non-sense, in the most drastic
<br>
connotations of the term.... [His influence] is nothing less than
<br>
disastrous, both philosophically and politically.... This is not, I repeat,
<br>
a finding that can be peremptorily dismissed or reduced to mere
<br>
professional myopia. It is a critique and counterstatement which should be
<br>
kept steadily in view, however problematic it makes the obvious dimension,
<br>
the intense presence of Heidegger's example and writings in current
<br>
reference and sensibility. (Steiner, 1992, pp. 4, 59)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemporary theory, in many respects both a child of and a reaction
<br>
against Heidegger, carries over much of his method of linguistic
<br>
peregrination. To cite Steiner once more: `His punning - where &quot;punning&quot; is
<br>
too feeble a designation for an uncanny receptivity to the fields of
<br>
resonance, of consonance, of suppressed echo in phonetic and semantic units
<br>
- has bred, to the point of parody, the post-structuralism and
<br>
deconstructionism of today' (p. xiii).
<br>
<p>===========================
<br>
<p>Looking for linguistic roots (the fossils of dead theories that form the
<br>
armature of language) and then elaborating from them arguments about the
<br>
nature of reality is as dangerous as supposing that The Ancients knew
<br>
Mysteries that We Poor Moderns have Forgotten (since the fall of, you know,
<br>
Atlantis and Mu).
