<p><em>&gt; How would you define sub-orbital ... ? (LEO?)
</em><br>
<p>I meant sub-LEO.  The particles have insufficient velocity to
<br>
make LEO, since they are fired backwards from a motor
<br>
that itself is at suborbital speed.  Then the charged exhaust
<br>
particles pick up velocity from interaction with charged particles
<br>
from the sun.  Then the exhaust particles go neutral by
<br>
interaction with ions in earth orbit, so that the solar wind is not
<br>
able to push them right out of orbit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Then the charged particle would interact with the solar wind,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar wind where? which side of the magnetosphere? at 10 R_Earth ..?
</em><br>
<p>Uh oh, I am way outta my expertise here.  Do let me study up on
<br>
the configuration of the magnetosphere, and perhaps I can answer
<br>
my own question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;particle could go neutral, as a direct result of interaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with charged particles in the Van Allen belts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm confused.. Is your hypothesis saying the particle lost energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from outside of the magnetosphere and traveled inwards (maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the magnetotail or magnetopause) ?
</em><br>
<p>Im the one who is confused.  I was thinking of a solid rocket
<br>
motor travelling on a parabolic path, the peak of which is lower
<br>
than about half an earth radius.  I was thinking there was some
<br>
mechanism that could accelerate a charged particle from the
<br>
exhaust plume and get it up to orbit velocity before its
<br>
charge was neutralized by interaction with ions in orbit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;trapping a bunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of stuff in orbit, since the neutral junk would not then be carried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;away by the solar wind. All this from a *suborbital shot*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summary: you think that might have a collection of neutral particles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trapped in the magnetosphere from this suborbital shot ?
</em><br>
<p>Ja.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First you need to define for me particle sizes:
</em><br>
<p>OK, a typical solid rocket motor would have every size particle,
<br>
from perhaps hundreds of microns down to smoke.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the submicron radius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles take a long time (hours) to reach equilibrium charge potential,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so they get accelerated quickly out of the Earth's magnetosphere.
</em><br>
<p>Good.  {8-]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The larger particle sizes reflect better the Earth plasma conditions (their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger size means larger surface area to the impinging ions and electrons),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and quickly reach equilibrium charge potential (the charging times vary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportional to the size of the particle). The Earth's magnetosphere is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very energetic (plasma-wise and magnetic-field-wise) place, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles are charged up constantly.
</em><br>
<p>Im guessing those Matlab scripts you developed for modelling spewing
<br>
volcanos on the surface of Io should be adaptable to spewing rocket
<br>
motors in a suborbital lob.  {8-]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The people who have done the most work on this topic are Antal Juhász
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Mihaly Horányi
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; debris in the Earth's plasma environment,&quot; J Geophys Res 102,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Amara, these references bring up a question perhaps far more
<br>
important than our discussion of space debris.  These references
<br>
to Juhász and Horányi are of great use to serious researchers
<br>
but not of much use to those like me with just a casual interest
<br>
in the topic.
<br>
<p>We who use the web a lot are becoming fondly accustomed to
<br>
just clicking on a reference instead of going to an actual library
<br>
doing actual *work*.  {8^D  I figure some time in the next few
<br>
years, this world will realize we need to get all such research
<br>
online, even if it is on pay sites.  spike
