</em><br>
<p>Estonia removed trade tariffs entirely (a very un-European behavior),
<br>
and the results were so good that they are now in front of the queue to
<br>
join the EU - where they will have to insert tariffs again. 
<br>
<p>I doubt the constitutional form really matters much for outside
<br>
investments compared to things like culture and perceived stability.
<br>
<p>The important thing about the former eastern bloc is that building a
<br>
working civil society is hard. Past oppression is only half of the
<br>
problem; now they are stuck in a halfway position where much of the old
<br>
bureaucracy remains (just look at <a href="http://www.heritage.org/index/">http://www.heritage.org/index/</a> and see
<br>
where they end up - Estonia is leading at rank 14, the Czechs at 26,
<br>
Russia is down at 127) while the lack of reliable property law makes
<br>
mafias both necessary (to protect you against threats) and growing in a
<br>
vicious circle. It is not easy to just get rid of a factor, since they
<br>
tend to interlock. On the other hand, it can be done, as several of the
<br>
former East bloc countries have demonstrated. 
<br>
<p>Just for fun, I did a plot of GDP per capita vs. economic freedom at
<br>
<a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/bilder/ecofree.jpg">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/bilder/ecofree.jpg</a>
<br>
<p>Maybe I have watched too many singularity presentations, but I cannot
<br>
help thinking there is a vertical asymptote at freedom = 1... (I'm not
<br>
serious about that; there is more factors than being free that play in,
<br>
and besides the loglogplot isn't as cheering).
