</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ---Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during World War II
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I could go  on, but here's an appeal to authority if I ever saw one.
</em><br>
<p>Despite the fact that 'appeals to authority' are not admissible debate
<br>
tactics. However, whether Hiroshima or Nagasaki were legitimate targets
<br>
is a completely separate issue from whether using an atomic weapon is
<br>
legitimate for military forces. It can be said that nukes are
<br>
specifically political, not military, weapons. 
<br>
<p>However, note that Leahy's statement uses the qualifier &quot;Materal
<br>
assistance&quot;. Whether a weapons use is of material assistance or not is
<br>
completely separate from whether it is of psychological assistance. In
<br>
that respect, a nuclear weapon is an entirely psychological weapon, as
<br>
any weapon of terror is. Military officers, especially those living at
<br>
that point in time, here in the US, were trained to specifically distain
<br>
any sort of 'unconventional warfare' as against the chivalrous
<br>
principles that evolved from the european martial tradition, and the
<br>
English one specifically. 
<br>
<p>Japan suffered from no such prejudices. In the Japanese martial
<br>
tradition, Sun Tsu's &quot;The Art of War&quot; was read, not Clausewitz's tome by
<br>
the same name. The Japanese martial tradition viewed victory as its own
<br>
end, and any means were permissible to achieve it. The only dishonor was
<br>
surrender. For this reason, Japan never signed the Geneva Conventions.
