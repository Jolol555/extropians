<br>
about jealousy wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can easily imagine those females who bred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with possessive males having more reproductive success.  Their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men would perhaps be more likely to stay by and help raise the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larvae if they had a sense of ownership.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip] I have a hard time imagining a stable society in which most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the copulation took place in anything other than practical monogamy.
</em><br>
<p>Scientists have studied this.  You should read a book like &quot;The Red Queen&quot;.
<br>
Humans by and large, just like other animals aren't &quot;faithful&quot;.  For
<br>
men sperm is cheap and if they can get away with sowing it elsewhere
<br>
it is to their advantage to do so.  Women on the other hand have to
<br>
live with the fact that men have risky professions (may not come
<br>
back from the hunt, etc.) so currying the favors of another man
<br>
from time to time may keep meat on the table when otherwise times
<br>
would be pretty tough.
<br>
<p>The roots of jealousy are simple -- men never know if a child is
<br>
really theirs and women never know when a man will leave them
<br>
for a more fertile woman.  So protecting the turf is built into
<br>
the meme set and probably the gene set.
<br>
<p>(Before you start to throw things -- go *read* about it.
<br>
Much of the thinking about this has been turned on its
<br>
head by the advent of DNA testing.  I think with humans the
<br>
figures for extra-marital fatherhood are 10-15%).
<br>
<p>I always solved the concept of jealousy and faithfulness by
<br>
informing girlfriends I would simply determine whether or not
<br>
a child was mine.  That approach rationalizes jealousy very
<br>
quickly.
