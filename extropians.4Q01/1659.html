<p><em>    &gt; You must be joking.
</em><br>
<p>Observe the lack of humor, characteristic of the true believer.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;This &quot;war&quot; is not about freedom,
</em><br>
<p>One of her rare true statements, this war is of course about not
<br>
dying. Her reason for putting the word in quotation marks, assuming
<br>
there is a reason, is unknown.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;It is about vengeance, incredible hypocrisy and dishonesty about our
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;own &quot;terrorism&quot; and grabbing more power
</em><br>
<p>Here we see yet another fine example of blithering idiocy. She believes that crashing
<br>
4 civilian airliners, damaging the Pentagon, destroying the WTC and murdering
<br>
6 thousand Americans is too trivial a reason to go to war, rather Americans
<br>
decided to attack to poorest country in the world for fun. The purity and
<br>
magnitude of the foolishness can only leave one humbled and awestruck.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;in  a region where we have been attempting to get rights to pipe oil
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; across to growing Southeast Asian market for sometime.
</em><br>
<p>Now this is something quite different, not an example of stupidly but rather
<br>
an ignorance of Afghanistan, one of the most mountainous countries in the
<br>
world, as any fourth grade geography student could tell you. It is hard to
<br>
imagine a more difficult or expensive way to move oil than building a pipeline
<br>
in a hostile land over a 20,000 foot mountain range; however if mass murder
<br>
is not enough to explain how a war starts the true believer needs to invent
<br>
a story to explain it. This one needs work.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;At the current rate millions of Afghanis will die this winter from hunger.
</em><br>
<p>There are two schools of thoughts on this, one that it is just more of the
<br>
above mentioned blithering idiocy, the other that it is a disingenuous
<br>
attempt to shift the blame from those who are really stopping the food trucks
<br>
to that of the USA. This question has not been resolved
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;we have become so monstrous  we do not even comprehend what we
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;are any longer or what our ideals are or what we wish they are.  We will
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;have become only a self-justifying blind King of Tyrants. [...]   media largely
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;controlled by the same corporations that  made our President and VP rich men
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Hysteria of this sort is emblematic of the species Marxius Leninus or
<br>
Imbecileus Chomskyus, but it's difficult to make a firm identification.
