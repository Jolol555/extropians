<em>&gt; &gt; The sooner they are wiped out, the less it will cost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this comment is correctly attributed, then you aren't choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a particularly extropic path J.R.
</em><br>
<p>The comment is quite extropic, IMO, and I stand by it.
<br>
Wiping out terrorists implies that none are left to oppose extropic systems.
<br>
Since none would be left, there would be none to hate the US or to produce
<br>
another army.
<br>
You have (very un-extropically) mistaken &quot;Muslims&quot; for terrorists.
<br>
What about the Muslims in the US Army?
<br>
Which is why you need to remember that we're talking about terrorists, not
<br>
soldiers, and that my comment (above) applies to terrorists.
<br>
Furthermore, you have (again un-extropically) forgotten that terrorists are
<br>
not born that way, they are conditioned and indoctrinated for many years in
<br>
order to make them that way. It is a matter of memetics, not genetics. So,
<br>
birth rates are irrelevant.
<br>
Note that I did not say how terrorism should be wiped out, so it can be done
<br>
with the most technologically advanced techniques, but since the longer we
<br>
wait, the bigger the problem may grow, it follows that the sooner terrorism is
<br>
wiped out, the less it will cost.
<br>
Conversely (and obviously), the longer it takes, the more it will cost.
<br>
So, once again: The sooner they (meaning terrorists, of course) are wiped out,
<br>
the less it
<br>
will cost.
<br>
The urgency of the situation needs to be addressed. Not silver linings.
<br>
So the most extropic thing to do is to wipe them out ASAP.
<br>
<p>IMO, cryonics is a luddite dream. Instead of freezing dysfunctional brains
<br>
(maintaining the status quo), we need to build better ones (bringing about a
<br>
better future).
<br>
We have no evidence whatsoever to support the conjecture that their &quot;minds&quot;
<br>
can be changed, but if they could be, then that would effectively wipe them
<br>
out... which is what I have been advocating all along.
<br>
Aggressive extropy is the best policy.
<br>
Putting terrorists in jail would be anti-extropic. Jail is exactly the
<br>
breeding
<br>
ground that hatred and mental illness thrives in.
<br>
Ending terrorism is far more effective than merely confining (and possibly
<br>
breeding) it.
<br>
I think you should reconsider the much more extropic advantages of wiping them
<br>
out quickly.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
