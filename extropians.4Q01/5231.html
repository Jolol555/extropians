</em><br>
<p>Well, here is a rough sketch of how you could run things. More refined
<br>
versions are possible:
<br>
<p>The &quot;federation&quot; simply consists of the communities that agree on the
<br>
constitution. This constitution contains penalty clauses and likely some
<br>
mutual defense clauses against outside threats. If a community violates the
<br>
constitution, it has to pay the penalty. If it refuses, then it clearly
<br>
isn't part of the federation. In addition to clauses guaranteeing free
<br>
emigration, it doesn't seem unreasonable to include clauses about free
<br>
travel or even inspection from the other communities. 
<br>
<p>Presumably (since it is formed), there is are advantages in being part of
<br>
such a federation - ethical, trade, flow of people (the real creators of
<br>
wealth), mutual protection, possibly status and the &quot;seal of approval&quot; that
<br>
comes from obeying the constitution (people prefer to move to and invest in
<br>
nations where there is a rule of law and the likeliehood of arbitrary
<br>
destructive change is low). Being thrown out would likely be a fairly
<br>
serious punishment, which unlike penalties cannot be avoided.
<br>
<p>Detection of violation can of course never be a foolproof system, but I
<br>
think the combination of free emigration, inspection rights and the ease of
<br>
whistleblowing given modern technology makes detection sufficiently likely
<br>
that it would act as a deterrent from much bad behavior.  It is also rather
<br>
unlikely a truly closed society would accept being part of a federation
<br>
like this, since it would have to agree to limitations on its power that
<br>
most closed societies object strongly to, like free migration.
<br>
<p>You are apparently thinking more in terms of AI slavery than political
<br>
prisoners. Whether the consitution would be about sentient rights or human
<br>
rights is of course important in the long run, but setting up a system
<br>
somewhat like the above federation is something we can do in the near
<br>
future. This system can then adapt to new developments, and if the
<br>
constitution update process is not unnecessarily rigid it wouldn't be too
<br>
hard to include general sentient rights as people become more aware of
<br>
their possibility. 
<br>
<p>The important thing to remember about systems like this is that we do not
<br>
have to get everything perfectly right at the first try. Good political
<br>
solutions are flexible and can be adaptive.
