<em>&gt; The problem with this statement is that it presumes that it is possible to

<p>When someone is arrested on charges of violating immigration laws, after
<br>
being reported by his flight instructor for only wanting to learn how to
<br>
fly a plane in the air, not take off or land, it is rather obvious to
<br>
ANYONE with a brain that the guy is a terrorist.

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Outside of OBL and al Qaeda, the rest of the blame for 9-11 falls
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is a very unfortunate statement that you might like to retract.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see any similarity between the activities of an organisation that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeks to defend civil liberties in the US and a terrorist organisation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for thousands of murders.
</em><br>
<p>The ACLU IS a terrorist organization responsible for thousands of
<br>
murders. They do NOT defend civil liberties that their left-wing agenda
<br>
is opposed to. For instance, the ACLU has NEVER defended anyone's 2nd
<br>
Amendment rights, and is on record with an official policy of supporting
<br>
gun control and gun confiscation laws. Since it has been conclusively
<br>
shown that gun use by law abiding citizens saves far more lives than it
<br>
costs (and those that do die from gun use by law abiding citizens are
<br>
more likely to be criminals than not) then the ACLU is responsible for
<br>
the deaths of thousands of Americans who die from criminal assaults,
<br>
unable to defend themselves due to gun control laws.
