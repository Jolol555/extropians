<p>
It seems quite clear that anti-US resentment will not go away soon in
<br>
the world. Anders spoke about such feelings in EUrope, and then
<br>
rightly said, &quot;And remember - we are your *allies*. Now think about
<br>
the rest of the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>These feelings have some good reasons (some of the interventions
<br>
mentionned here these days, etc.), and some bad reasons (false
<br>
representations, jealousy, blaming your misfortunes on someone else
<br>
and escaping your responsability, etc.)
<br>
<p>I think the resentment is bad, not (only) because it is so sad for the
<br>
US to be misunderstood, but because it allows leaders in those
<br>
countries to bring their countries in destructive and
<br>
auto-destructive directions.
<br>
<p>So what about issuing a kind of formal, symbolic, named, short,
<br>
evocative, simple, strong statement of the basic world view and
<br>
intentions of the US, for all people to refer to it. It would be
<br>
directed to everyone, and written in terms understandable by all.
<br>
<p>I have no idea how this could be done, and I see all sorts of problems
<br>
with it (lack of agreement within the US on the said worldview and
<br>
intentions, risk of committing unilateraly to something, mockery from
<br>
the media, opposition from the Arab dirigeants being bypassed in the
<br>
communication, etc.) But I throw the idea anyway, as I really feel
<br>
something like that, something other than mere action, is needed, and
<br>
should at least be tried.
<br>
<p>Such a statement would not say : we are so altruistic. Instead, it
<br>
would be sincere. It would give an idea of the US constitution as
<br>
their view on society (individual freedom, respect and
<br>
responsability). It would affirm the desire to share this world
<br>
peacefully, productively, and happily. It would be a call to
<br>
responsability, too, something like : reject terrorism and hatred,
<br>
affirm your pride and your aspirations, your future is in your own
<br>
hands, and we'll be happy to help a bit if we can. Maybe it would even
<br>
give some clue about economy, and make a convincing case that riches
<br>
are not like a big god-given pie to share equitably, but they are
<br>
something people create through their talent and efforts. People could
<br>
debate about it. Maybe it would even acknowldege some of the US
<br>
wrongs.
<br>
<p>As things are now, I think you can convince about any person in third
<br>
world countries with the riches-as-pie fallacy, and consequently bring
<br>
them to hate the US. Someone has to tell them that they are going
<br>
nowhere that way. This appeared to me clearly while talking over email
<br>
with a muslim arab friend living in Mauritania.
<br>
<p>However it is received in the first weeks, the statement would stay
<br>
(in some form), and maybe it would start later a reflexion in many
<br>
minds.
<br>
<p>Is that useless or can it be mutated into something useful ? If a
<br>
statement is not feasible, could something else play that role ? Do
<br>
the US already effectively communicate their views to the people, in
<br>
their own language ? If not, no wonder they don't understand the US.
<br>
When you intervene in someone else's world, it looks quite normal to
<br>
introduce yourself.
