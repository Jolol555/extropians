</em><br>
<p>Well explained. I also think tolerance would be a prerequisite to even
<br>
get to this clading stage, because without it the technology is going to
<br>
be so controversial that we all get entangled in struggles over it and
<br>
between different clades-to-be that we do not get anywhere, at least not
<br>
in a good shape. Look at the stem cell debate, and think about the
<br>
reactions to even doing germline engineering on humans. 
<br>
<p>How to promote this tolerance? Exposing people to the idea that clading
<br>
and technological transformation is likely to occur will not itself do
<br>
it; if the genetic engineering debate is any guide it will only polarize
<br>
opinions. What matters is not facts, but values - we need to promote the
<br>
*value* of tolerance. One way is of course as Eli mentioned through
<br>
fiction, and most sf today has indeed extended the 'us' concept to all
<br>
of mindkind, be it humans, aliens, AI or posthumans. But sf is a rather
<br>
marginalized genre, we want/need to get more tolerance into the
<br>
mainstream. We are not alone in this, but we have a somewhat broader
<br>
perspective than most other tolerance promoters. That suggests that it
<br>
would be reasonable to team up with them in their activities, giving
<br>
them a mild exposure to a broader vision of tolerance than just
<br>
tolerance between races, religions or ethnicities. No need to convert
<br>
people, just to quietly extend tolerance on a broad front. The animal
<br>
rights movement has succeded admirably (even if I think much of it is
<br>
misguided too) in doing something similar with the concept of rights for
<br>
animals. Learn from their success, and use the uniqueness of
<br>
transhumanism to its best advantage.
