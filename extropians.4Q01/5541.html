<p><em>&gt;&gt;From Brian D Williams 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The way to lower the crime rate is to actually hold criminals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; accountable for their own behavior. Something rarely practiced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; here in the U.S..
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It would be a very good thing to clarify that remark quite a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit.  We have more people in jail per capita than any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;country.  We have mandated fixed sentences for many offenses and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;removed the judges ability to consider extenuating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circumstances.  We have mandated &quot;3 strikes and you're out&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some states.  Some 46% of all prisoners are in on (mostly minor)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drug offenses.  Roughly 2 million people are now in prison in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US.  Perhaps this is not what you consider &quot;accountability&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it certainly is a clear sign that something is dangerously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong in this country - dangerous to all of us.  Also please pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a lot of attention to cleaning up what is a &quot;criminal&quot; by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current often asinine laws and what is rationally a &quot;criminal&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Quite different things. 
</em><br>
<p>I think we would tend to agree that drug related offences are
<br>
something completely different, and most should not be criminal at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>Here in Chicago, handguns are completely illegal and have been for
<br>
20 years now.
<br>
<p>By the logic of the antigun folks, Chicago should by now be
<br>
completely free of handguns and violent crimes like murder should
<br>
be non-existant. The fact is that there are millions of handguns in
<br>
the Chicago, 650+ murders this year, and gun related crime is an
<br>
everyday occurrence in certain neighborhoods.
<br>
<p>Yet the fact is (as any prosecuter here can tell you) is that the
<br>
first thing that happens when an offender gets brought to court is
<br>
that the weapons charges are usually dropped and the case is plea
<br>
bargained.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Our disasterous &quot;war on drugs&quot; has also brought quite a bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violence and higher levels of organized crime to our culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just like the first Prohibition did.  Only the faces and form
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has changed.  
</em><br>
<p><p>We are in complete agreement on this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I agree.  When I bought a gun I became much more responsible and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thoughtful about my reactions and attitudes, not less so.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hear this is a pretty common reaction.
</em><br>
<p><p>Delighted to hear it, and yes, contrary to urban myths, gun owners
<br>
are far more likely to be the most responsible of citizens.
<br>
