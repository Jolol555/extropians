<p>Frankly, this is worse than calling names.  You are directly
<br>
impugning my honor and intelligence and that of anyone and
<br>
everyone who disagrees with your fundamental positions.  Does
<br>
this not strike you as a pretty lame and inflammatory argument
<br>
technique?  A democracy, and better yet, a republic depends on
<br>
the freedom of its citizens to question and disagree with any
<br>
actions and policies of the State.  I think you, of all people,
<br>
fully know and appreciate this.  So why do you choose to cast
<br>
such aspersions on those who disagree with you?  I don't
<br>
consider such muddying of the waters to be a very honest or
<br>
reputable debating technique.
