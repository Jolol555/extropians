<em>&gt; &quot;Smigrodzki, Rafal&quot; :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Let's assume that the whole of reality is a mathematical construct - a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-evolving formal system, not constrained by the laws of physics (such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservation laws), whose infinitesimally small subset is our observable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical world, with it's laws ultimately derived from a set of axioms and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules of production. No entity external to the totality of this system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists, hence it is not a simulation, but rather an explosion of pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics, arising spontaneously and unavoidably from a true and absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothingness, in all the unimaginable ways pure math could develop, with new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensions of the axiom set adding themselves whenever undecidable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorems arise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (snip)
</em><br>
<p>Good point. Let me do some ... bricolage.....
<br>
<p>First. A self-evolving system seems to require a &quot;loop&quot; and 
<br>
not a &quot;tower of turtles, ad infinitum&quot;. 
<br>
<p>J.A. Wheeler, in example, wrote: &quot;To endlessness no
<br>
alternative is evident but a loop, such as: physics
<br>
gives rise to observer-participancy; observer-participancy
<br>
gives rise to information; and information gives rise to
<br>
physics&quot; [&quot;Information, Physics, Quantum: The Search
<br>
for Links&quot;, in Complexity, Entropy and the Physics of
<br>
Information, ed. W.H. Zurek, Perseus Books, 1991].
<br>
<p>Christof Schmidhuber also shares this kind of approach,
<br>
and pushes it to extremes. 
<br>

<br>
<p>Kauffman wonders if &quot;Category Theory&quot;, or &quot;Topos Theory&quot;, 
<br>
with the elements recursively constructing themselves, 
<br>
might be a suitable mathematical basis for these kinds of 
<br>
systems. Self-evolving things are constantly generating new 
<br>
kinds of members, with a generative, non-convergent, open-ended, 
<br>
forever growing recursion. Recursions? And simulations?

<br>
<p>Roger Penrose [&quot;The Emperor's New Mind&quot;, 1989, paperback ed. pp
<br>
435-447] has calculated that, in order to produce a universe, like the
<br>
one in which we live, would require selection of a volume equal to 
<br>
10^(-10^23) of the volume of the phase space of all possible universes. 
<br>
Although that is a nonrigorous discussion of the probability that the 
<br>
Weyl tensor = 0 (required for low-entropy recollapsing universes) this 
<br>
number is a teeny tiny itsy bitsy little number.  This calculation suggests 
<br>
that it is virtually impossible that a universe that exhibits the entropy 
<br>
and the order present in our universe could be created at random.
<br>
<p>Created at random? &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot; [John, I, 1, 3].
<br>
But Augustine - attention - replied &quot;God made heaven and earth
<br>
in the beginning, not in the beginning of time, but in Christ. For he
<br>
was the Word with the Father, through whom and in whom all things
<br>
were made.&quot; [Augustine, &quot;On Genesis&quot;, Catholic Univ. of America Press,
<br>
Washington, D.C., 1991]. Was St. Augustine saying that Christ was a
<br>
simulation? Who knows...
<br>
<p>Hawking  [A brief History of Time, pages 136-141] wrote &quot;There would
<br>
be no singularities at which the laws of science broke down and no
<br>
edge of space-time at which one would have to appeal to God or some
<br>
new law to set the boundary conditions for space-time ..... The Universe
<br>
would be completely self-contained and not affected by anything outside
<br>
itself. It would neither be created nor destroyed. It would just be.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Too late! Aristotle already said &quot;the world as a whole was not generated 
<br>
and cannot be destroyed.&quot; [De Caelo, II, 1, 283b-27]. And much more
<br>
in &quot;The Physics&quot;, VIII, 1, 250-252. 
<br>
<p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz [The Monadology, 64-66] wrote:
<br>
But the machines of nature, namely, living bodies, are still machines 
<br>
in their smallest parts ad infinitum. It is this that constitutes the
<br>
difference between nature and art, that is to say, between the divine 
<br>
art and ours. And the Author of nature has been able to employ this divine 
<br>
and infinitely wonderful power of art, because each portion of matter is not 
<br>
only infinitely divisible, as the ancients observed, but is also actually subdivided 
<br>
without end, each part into further parts, of which each has some motion of 
<br>
its own; otherwise it would be impossible for each portion of matter to express 
<br>
the whole universe. Whence it appears that in the smallest particle of matter
<br>
there is a world of creatures, living beings, animals, entelechies, souls.
<br>
Each portion of matter may be conceived as like a garden full of plants 
<br>
and like a pond full of fishes. But each branch of every plant, each member 
<br>
of every animal, each drop of its liquid parts is also some such garden or pond.
<br>
And though the earth and the air which are between the plants of the garden, 
<br>
or the water which is between the fish of the pond, be neither plant nor fish; 
<br>
yet they also contain plants and fishes, but mostly so minute as to be 
<br>
imperceptible to us.

<br>
<p>And Ockam (with Pier Damiani - De Divina Omnipotentia - and
<br>
Aristotle) states that not even God, who is in possession of 
<br>
&quot;potentia absoluta&quot; - it means: miracles - not just of &quot;potentia 
<br>
ordinata&quot; - usual physical laws, could erase the past, or re-write it.
<br>
Does it mean that, according to Ockam, simulations are forbidden? 
<br>
But Ockam (as the Aquinas and also Wyclif) generously thinks 
<br>
that God could create the multiverse, or many universes.
<br>
<p>At last, Leibniz also wrote: &quot;although the whole of this life were 
<br>
said to be nothing but a dream and the physical world nothing but a
<br>
phantasm, I should call this dream or phantasm real enough if, using
<br>
reason well, we were never deceived by it.&quot;.
<br>
<p>And that's all, for tonight.
