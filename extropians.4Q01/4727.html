<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, they deserve fundamental protections simply as human

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are apparently rather ignorant of history. Under the Geneva
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Conventions, a combatant caught in civilian clothes in a zone of combat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is subject to summary execution, which has been used more often than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not, it was not until Vietnam that one of these cases actually made it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into the news, because prior to that the news media was fully aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Conventions and what they said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; History has little to do with a blatant disregard of the obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences between the detainees rounded up in the US after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9/11 and any such situation as you outline.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Prosecution of war crimes by combatants does not belong in civilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; courts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot hinges on who you label &quot;combatants&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>A non-citizen engaged in a conspiracy to aid, abet, give shelter, or
<br>
engage in attacks on our country are 'combatants', and 'illegal
<br>
combatants' at that, since they wear no uniform. They made our country a
<br>
combat zone by their attack on civilian targets with hijacked airliners,
<br>
since airliners could be used to attack ANY target here in the US.
<br>
Because our entire country is now a combat zone, they must live with the
<br>
consequences of their actions. Their actions created this status, thus
<br>
every member of their group found within this combat zone is therefore
<br>
an illegal combatant. Because they do not wear a uniform, they try to
<br>
blend into the law abiding muslim population, they make all muslims
<br>
legitimate targets under the Geneva Conventions. We are demonstrating
<br>
incredibly remarkable sensitivity and restraint in the small number of
<br>
the mumlim community we have detained. The Geneva Conventions, read
<br>
literally, DO, in fact, permit us to detain all individuals in the
<br>
country of the nationalities involved in the attacks. The fact that we
<br>
do not demonstrates how civilized we really are.
<br>
<p>Once again, I suggest you read the conventions before you continue to
<br>
make a fool of yourself.
