<em>&gt; Huh?!?!  Most of the cartridges you mention most definitely do *not* have a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; low ballistic coefficients, where the BC defines the flatness of a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The .300WM has the same BC as the .30-06, but a little faster so flatter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The .270 (Winchester, not Remington) has a nearly identical trajectory as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the .30-06 for a given BC, but in a slightly smaller platform.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, out of that entire list, only the .300WM is generally a flatter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shooting cartridge than the .30-06 at a distance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have to say, I am puzzled that you made these mistakes as I would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected you to know these in your sleep.
</em><br>
<p>Shooting from the hip, of course. ;)
<br>
<p>While the 30-06 is a standard military round dating back to WWI, where
<br>
average infantrymen could make 600-1000 yard shots on enemy soldiers
<br>
with general regularity (though the 8mm Mauser 98 of the same period is
<br>
considered a better long range weapon). The standard listed BC for the
<br>
larger caliber rounds are generally published for round nose big game
<br>
rounds, where you want to put as much metal into the meat as possible
<br>
(and as deep as possible, with good spreading). There are a number of
<br>
factory loads for these larger calibers with relatively high BCs and
<br>
rather flat trajectories. Now, I personally don't recommend these for
<br>
everybody, unless you are a Palma class shooter with similar credentials
<br>
in the NSCA handicapping system for clays shooting... The advantage of
<br>
the 30-06, beyond its relatively flat trajectory, is its utter ubiquity.
<br>
It is one of the easiest rounds to buy at great quantities from surplus
<br>
very cheaply.
<br>
<p>The comment I made about the 30-06 was specifically targeted in
<br>
comparison to the .270, which according to Ruger and several gun mag
<br>
writers, has a flatter trajectory than the 30-06, which is why they
<br>
consider it a superior deer round versus target rounds, because your
<br>
average hunter doesn't have the time to tweak on his mildot scope like a
<br>
bench rest target shooter does.
