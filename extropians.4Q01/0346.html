But by our standards, when the CIA with little or no
<br>
oversight and using secret funds goes to various
<br>
countries and topples their elected governments using
<br>
a variety of means including those which cannot be
<br>
termed other than terrorism, torture, assasination,
<br>
sabotage and so on - is this somehow not criminal
<br>
but a reasonable function of the government?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
It seems to me there is a bit of a double standard
<br>
here.  As bad as WTC was we have been involved in
<br>
covert operations in countries we were not at war
<br>
with, even in countries we were supposedly friends
<br>
with that are every bit as horrendous.

<p>Samantha's got it right, of course. And I suspect that
<br>
perhaps, after years of *almost* hearing this
<br>
unpleasant truth, off in the distance, whispered from
<br>
some corner, or heard but instantly expunged by inner
<br>
denial, it is time to grit one's teeth, and take it
<br>
in.  Take it all.  September 11th was a kind of end of
<br>
innocence.

<br>
<p>is a luxury that may have to be set aside temporarily,
<br>
till &quot;the problem&quot; of the wider world--the problem
<br>
which spilled over into Manhattan on Sept. 11th--is
<br>
dealt with.  
<br>
<p>To deal with a problem effectively, you'd best have
<br>
the facts--the truth.  So maybe Chomsky's time has
<br>
come.  I am NOT going to take it upon myself to be
<br>
Chomsky's tireless advocate on this list.  The damn
<br>
planes did not plow into me, and, for all I care, the
<br>
world, including the US, can--and probably will--take
<br>
a little tour through hell before the sheeple go back
<br>
once again to merrily sniffing the crotches of the
<br>
rich and famous on the six o'clock news.  
<br>
<p>If YOU think it serves your quest for rationalism to
<br>
drink from the Chomskian well, you know where it is. 
<br>
That said, you can expect me to occasionally offer up
<br>
something if it seems germane. 
<br>
<p>Here's one of the tributaries to the well:
<br>
<p><a href="http://monkeyfist.com:8080/ChomskyArchive">http://monkeyfist.com:8080/ChomskyArchive</a>

<br>
To call it a &quot;war against terrorism,&quot; however, is
<br>
simply more propaganda, unless the &quot;war&quot; really does
<br>
target terrorism. But that is plainly not
<br>
contemplated. Perhaps I may quote political scientist
<br>
Michael Stohl: &quot;We must recognize that by convention
<br>
-- and it must be emphasized _only_ by convention --
<br>
great power use and the threat of the use of force is
<br>
normally described as coercive diplomacy and not as a
<br>
form of terrorism,&quot; though it commonly involves &quot;the
<br>
threat and often the use of violence for what would be
<br>
described as terroristic purposes were it not great
<br>
powers who were pursuing the very same tactic,&quot; in
<br>
accord with the literal meaning of the term. 
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis

<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
