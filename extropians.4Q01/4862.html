<p>Ja, there was a space shuttle experiment a few years ago that
<br>
was slightly damaged by a particle they think was a hundreds
<br>
of microns diameter bit of solid rocket motor slag.  There had
<br>
not been a solid motor launch for some time before that mission.

<p>The French were using solids way up, I understand.  NASA has
<br>
been pretty responsible with high solids, but that stands to reason
<br>
I suppose.  They have a lot to lose.

<p>Cool thanks!  I would be interested in that.
<br>
<p>Our sub-launched nukes are all-stages solid, but of course they
<br>
are sub-orbital, and we've never had a final stage flip around
<br>
fiery end first.  The last 96 test flights in a row have all been
<br>
successful.
<br>
<p>I heard of a theoretical mechanism which I find intriguing,
<br>
but Im not sure I believe it.  They say a few exhaust particles
<br>
can somehow backscatter against its own exhaust plume, and
<br>
end up going almost the same direction and almost the same
<br>
velocity as the motor which just ejected it.  Some computer
<br>
modelling guy figured out a few parts per trillion can
<br>
scatter off the plume in such a way as to go *forward* of the
<br>
rocket.  Does that make any sense at all?  Seemed kinda far
<br>
fetched to me.  spike
