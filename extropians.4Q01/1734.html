</em><br>
<p><p>Having effective and useful long-term evacuation plans is neither simple nor
<br>
non-disruptive.  I think you underestimate the amount of resources and
<br>
effort required if someone was serious about this.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 3. We're not talking about all-out nuclear winter here! Far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely is the collapse of the global economy, communications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure, and rational, secular, civil society. That is easier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prepare for, since you can assume able-bodied adults living in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area with sufficient resources will be able to fulfill their basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs. That means more attention can be devoted to preservation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes and rebuilding of society (perhaps in a more Extropic image this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time around ;-).
</em><br>
<p><p>Your concept is at odds with itself.  You and your friends can't pack up and
<br>
evacuate AND actually accomplish something useful while not putting any
<br>
significant amount of time or resources into the scenario up front.  It just
<br>
doesn't work out that nicely.  What most people imagine it would be like is
<br>
not what it WOULD be like.  The devil is in the details.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 4. That being said, locations should be chosen such that they are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact in areas with adequate farmland and a local supply of drinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; water, a day's or so drive from where most of the participants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live. They also need to be far from potential military and economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targets and have low populations.
</em><br>
<p><p>You make far too many assumptions.  How do you get a local supply of
<br>
drinking water without some investment in having access to clean drinking
<br>
water (with all the things that go along with that)?  You have to think like
<br>
this about every single item in your list.  If you want the convenience of
<br>
things automagically being available to you, you'll be shelling out some
<br>
serious money and time.  Nothing simple or non-disruptive about it.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, what do most people know about subsistence survival?  This
<br>
isn't the same as going backpacking, where your time horizon is limited by
<br>
design.  Most conventional solutions to survival problems are short-term
<br>
ones, not long-term like you are talking about.  And you don't pick up these
<br>
skills overnight by reading a book.  You can't survive as a tourist of the
<br>
lifestyle.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 5. The effort should be capable of scaling to an arbitrary number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participants, but should have a fair chance of succeeding with only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dozen or so.
</em><br>
<p><p>You could have a hundred modern city dwellers and still not have enough
<br>
skills among you to survive well.  The relevant abilities of the individuals
<br>
matter more than the numbers.  Scalability is almost a non-issue.  If every
<br>
person is autonomously prepared, then presumably they have everything they
<br>
need for their own survival.  However, having lots of people does allow some
<br>
specialization.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So, does anybody have any refinements of the above principles or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional principles they'd like to add? Any specific logistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas (locations, packing lists)? Anybody interested in starting an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian Fire Drill Club in Texas?
</em><br>
<p><p>With all due respect, you've romanticized a scenario.  There is nothing
<br>
fundamentally wrong with the concept, but the difference between your vision
<br>
of it and reality is immensely wide.  I'm a fairly confident that there is
<br>
only a handful of people on this list that could pull off what you are
<br>
suggesting for a long-term scenario and actually do it well at this point in
<br>
time.  You've overlooked so many issues and problems that I don't really
<br>
know where to begin.  As for gear, that should to be matched with a specific
<br>
scenario, even at the level of basics, though there would be some
<br>
commonality.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
