<p><em>&gt; I typically browse the Javien archives now for useful stuff but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider that rather noisy as well.  What is needed is something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that combines the best features of Slashdot, the Javien forum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and mailing lists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Slashdot approach is good for the reasons that (a) You can get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; headline trailers from it; (b) messages get moderated up or down;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (c) it has catagories that you can subscribe to or ignore.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Javien forum is very good from the perspective of displaying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation flow in a visual manner, but I can't seem to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the review/rate functions work (and even if they did, I doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough people are currently using the Javien Forum to make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as useful as the Slashdot moderation functions are.
</em><br>
<p>I would note that a transdot does exist, <a href="http://www.transhuman.memetree.com/">http://www.transhuman.memetree.com/</a>
<br>
<p>It needs more patronage, traffic, etc, etc. You are right about the absence
<br>
of e-mail support in slashcode. I do view that as a problem myself, which is
<br>
one of the reasons why I didn't chose slashcode to run the Longevity Meme
<br>
(<a href="http://www.longevityememe.org">http://www.longevityememe.org</a>), even though I'm doing some slashcode-like
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>Beyond that, I agree with the Robert's post. This long ago passed into the
<br>
realm of junk/social list. I know of the existance of a number of others for
<br>
different communities, and they do serve as a useful community-binding
<br>
mechanism, but those who get things done tend to use other lists.
<br>
<p>I would suggest that the immediate solution -- rather than to go and build
<br>
something new -- is:
<br>
<p>1) to make everyone more aware of transdot (URL above). Use it and it will
<br>
become a resource and benefit you.
<br>
<p>2) to create new sublists for interests (NOT geographical areas) within
<br>
extropianism. These will be lower traffic by their very nature. One of the
<br>
sublists should be an -announce list that will crosspost to all sublists and
<br>
the main list. All sublists should automatically append headers with
<br>
[LIST_NAME] -- this helps automatic mail filters a great deal.
<br>
<p>I have found 2) to work very well in other online commmunities. The main
<br>
list is still there serving its purpose, but low traffic interest sublists
<br>
are there for people who want that.
<br>
<p>If it's got to the point where the traffic is chasing people away, we need
<br>
to do this.
