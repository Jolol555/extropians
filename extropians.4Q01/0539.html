Clarifying, I do think of humans (participation) as chaotic systems of the &quot;second order&quot;. Natural chaotic systems, especially those of smaller scales, usually belong to the first order because mostly local influences play a part.
<br>
<p>However, humans introduce a whole set of chaos into a system because events far away, insignificant events and other non-local influences have a hand in influencing human decisions. In a system with high (individual) human control and interactions with other humans, then chaos of a second order will break out, especially if these humans do not think rationally (in the context of predictability).
<br>
<p>With prediction software, one causes a &quot;third order&quot; chaos to occur. By attempting to predict the market (and assuming that one acts on the prediction), then the market would enter a highly chaotic state quite to the extent of unpredictability. The unpredictability increases as the influence of the &quot;prediction&quot; software increases to the extent of making the predictions no better than chance.
<br>
<p>A system with first order chaos must have a predictive solution with non-linear equations, but a system with second order chaos would require something more complex like a simulation using hybrid AI systems. As for a system of the third order, I would like to know what others had discovered about this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; A brief glimpse at the circumstances under which markets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have ceased to have &quot;chaotic&quot; price movements shows that it is better that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do.  Such movements generally stop only when the markets cease to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function.
</em><br>
<p>I do not wish to make judgment whether a non-chaotic market will always suit our societies better. However, I do think that minimizing market chaotic-ness by providing free information flow and reducing deception (perhaps by an obligation of &quot;Free Speech&quot;) will increase market efficiency as a whole. I do not believe that minimizing chaos by imposing strict central control will increase efficiency.
<br>
<p>I do not advocate this for all societies, but think of this more as a thought experiment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If so, I must 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out that there are very powerful self-correcting features to the stock 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market which work to solve the problem you are talking about.  No better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution has been found.
</em><br>
<p>I would like to know about this systems, especially if you don't mean Adam Smith's invisible hand.
