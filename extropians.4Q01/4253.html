<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree.  Just because the world can't detect the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; doesn't mean there isn't one.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I beg to differ: what cannot be measured /doesn't exist/.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Do you really believe this?  Do you think, as an absolute, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we can measure today is the end and be-all of all that does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and can exist?  Are you sure?
</em><br>
<p>I certainly don't believe it as you just worded it; that would
<br>
indeed be silly.  Perhaps it would be more clearly expressed
<br>
as &quot;If you can't measure it--that is, if something makes no
<br>
percievable, describable affect on your (or anyone else's) senses
<br>
at the present time--then it can't possibly make any difference to
<br>
any decision you might make at that time.  Of course, if some later
<br>
discovery or technology makes something measurable, then it would
<br>
be rational to take it into account.  Electrons certainly &quot;existed&quot;
<br>
in a metaphysical sense before their discovery, but if someone
<br>
had by pure chance speculated about their existence before
<br>
anyone had any means of seeing their effects, that person would
<br>
have been irrational to claim their existence or make any
<br>
decisions based on their existence, even though his speculation
<br>
later turned out to be right.
<br>
<p>In the context of the discussion, if there is no way to tell
<br>
the difference between two atom-for-atom copies of something,
<br>
it cannot make any possible rational difference which one is
<br>
chosen for any reason.  &quot;Identity&quot; is not a measurable property
<br>
of matter like mass or charge.  It is an arbitrary choice made
<br>
for the purpose of reasoning and communication.  A convenient
<br>
short-cut for talking about relationships between matter and
<br>
different points of spacetime.
