<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't see the faulty reasoning.  Observation shows that most burned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objects are lighter than the original.  This leades to the (corect)
</em><br>
theory
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that something was released into the air.  An (incorrect) guess was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; substance that caused burning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely this is wrong. As I recall one of the things which undermined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phlogiston was the discovery from controlled experiments that the residue
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; a burnt object could actually weigh *more* than the original (due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addition of oxygen during combustion). The response of defenders of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phlogiston was to claim that phlogiston had negative weight i.e it weighed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than nothing. Shows just ho inventive people can be when trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserve a hypothesis. Steve Davies &lt;<a href="mailto:Steve365@btinternet.com?Subject=Re:%20Useless%20hypotheses&In-Reply-To=&lt;001101c18a1e$53e8c420$9044fa18@hntsvlle1.al.home.com&gt;">Steve365@btinternet.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Near the end, there were believers who went to great lengths to try to keep
<br>
the phlogiston theory.  However, notice what happened:
<br>
<p>1.  Scientists were faced with something they had no explanation for.  (What
<br>
causes burning.)
<br>
2.  Someone thinks up a theory that fits the facts.  (Burnable materials
<br>
contain a substance called phlogiston that is released violently when those
<br>
materials are heated.)
<br>
3.  Scientists looked at the theory to make a prediction of new facts.  (If
<br>
a substance is released then the ashes should always be lighter than the
<br>
original.)
<br>
4.  The prediction is tested.  (The prediction is wrong, because some
<br>
materials get heavier when burned.)
<br>
5.  The theory is discarded or modified.  (Most people discarded it.  Some
<br>
die-hards proposed that phlogiston had negative weight.)
<br>
<p>This is exactly what a theory is supposed to do.  Phlogiston was a perfectly
<br>
valid theory, based on observations.  The fact that it was wrong was based
<br>
on not knowing all the facts, not on any fault of the scientists at the
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>If it were not for the phlogiston theory's prediction that materials could
<br>
burn in a vacuum (which was shown to be incorrect), I don't think anyone
<br>
would have come up with a new theory that said the common element that
<br>
allowed burning must be available in the air.
<br>
<p>Theories are like searching a room for lost car keys.  If you find them,
<br>
great.  If you don't, it wasn't a wasted search.  It just tells you one more
<br>
room that doesn't have the answer.
