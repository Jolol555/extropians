<em>&gt; Pretty worrying stuff, but I don't have enough geopolitical knowledge to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judge its plausibility.  Any of the more alert listmembers care to offer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their opinion on likelihoods?
</em><br>
<p>This is a decent analysis, although a bit pessimistic.
<br>
<p>I think that one strategy we need to accept is to use the enemy's self
<br>
perceived 'strengths' against them just as they use ours against us.
<br>
<p>For example, the Taliban's mandate that women wear Burkhas to cover
<br>
themselves from the sight of stranger males. This is a significant
<br>
trojan horse for penetrating large quantities of special operatives into
<br>
the country, covered in burkhas. I would not doubt that this is being
<br>
used already. If the taliban becomes aware of this tactic, they must
<br>
give up their policy about mandating the use of Burkha's in order to
<br>
combat the threat. Thus, our means of attack can be used to force them
<br>
to change.
<br>
<p>Another example: the al Qaeda does not take credit for its acts, and
<br>
frequently denies its involvment, at least initially, which indicates
<br>
that its head may not be aware of the work of its cells until word comes
<br>
up the network that they did in fact do something. Use this to create
<br>
our own 'al Qaeda' cells which commit acts which ostensibly attack
<br>
targets in muslim countries which al Qaeda/Taliban considers corrupt,
<br>
but the vast majority of muslims do not. The attacks piss off lots of
<br>
muslims toward the al Qaeda and Taliban, which helps in the propaganda
<br>
war in the muslim world. This is a very 'dirty war' technique, one which
<br>
is certainly to be protested. The argument for it is that the terrorists
<br>
have established the standards by which they wish to fight the war.
<br>
Under the Geneva Conventions, a state is not bound by the
<br>
combatant/noncombatant delineation when enemy combatants hide behind
<br>
non-combatants.
<br>
<p>Thirdly: adopt our own network system. In the US Constitution, the
<br>
president is empowered (as are the governors of many US states) to issue
<br>
Letters of Marque to private individuals (privateers) to engage in
<br>
action against enemy commerce independent of government oversight or
<br>
command. Revive this to license independent mercenary companies that
<br>
will attack enemy targets as identified, with public bounties
<br>
established to receive donations from private citizens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS:  &quot;Pig Latin&quot;?  Irrationality in the service of liberty is no virtue.
</em><br>
<p>Your ham is pig rottin'.
