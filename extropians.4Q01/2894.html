<em>&gt; A gang of thugs cuts a bunch of throats and takes power and Samantha Atkins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinks that state of affairs is sacred and to oppose such criminals is somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the laws of nature.
</em><br>
<p>Especially since she is completely ignoring that part of the libertarian
<br>
principle about non-initiation of force that mandates your right to
<br>
respond with force when you are initiated against first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;More nations have been disrupted and had their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; governments forcefully destroyed and/or changed by the US using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; illegal means (our definition of terror) than any other nation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More than Germany, Japan, China or the USSR?  You really are a jackass.
</em><br>
<p>She is only spouting the relativist leftie part line.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Most of the old Soviet nuclear weapons are still in Russia and there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; good reason to believe that they are not totally well-managed and safe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; today.  Are we then ethically required to forcefully go in an seize these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;weapons before they come to harm?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can we be &quot;ethically required&quot; to do something that is impossible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We don't have the ability to solve that problem militarily in Russia, we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in other parts of the world.
</em><br>
<p>Especially since the Russians are quite willing to ask us for help in
<br>
managing their nuclear stockpiles, since they cant afford to do it
<br>
themselves. The problem is that there are those in congress who think
<br>
that pork for their home districts is more important than nuclear
<br>
terrorism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Do other countries have the right to demand that the US proves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; its intentions and the safety of its bio-weapons?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Read a book someday, the US has had no bio-weapons since 1972.
</em><br>
<p>Furthermore, we have never used bioweapons, and have held steadfastly to
<br>
treaties we sign, quite unlike most any other nation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      &gt;Do we have the right [...] it is not defensible [...] Do other countries have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; the right to Do we have the right [...] no inherent right [...] Are we then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;ethically required [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You keep spewing out this crap, as if they had objective answers.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;There is no controlling legal authority&quot;
