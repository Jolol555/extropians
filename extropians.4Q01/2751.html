<br>
<p>NOVEMBER IS NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AWARENESS MONTH
<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION WEEKLY UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
More on ibuprofen, curcumin against Alzheimer's disease
<br>
<p>Readers of Life Extension Weekly Update will recall the past week's &quot;Life
<br>
Extension Weekly Update Exclusive&quot; article which discussed a new mechanism
<br>
of action found for ibuprofen and two other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
<br>
drugs against Alzheimer's disease.  Presentations given this week at the
<br>
thirty-first annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience which took place
<br>
in San Diego, California, shed further light on ibuprofen as a possible
<br>
therapy against this dreaded disease, as well as elucidated the role of the
<br>
herb curcumin in its prevention.
<br>
<p>A transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease was used by researchers from
<br>
the University of Minnesota and UCLA to test the ability of ibuprofen to
<br>
prevent the decline in cognitive function that occurs with the disease.  The
<br>
animals were given diets containing ibuprofen prior to the development of
<br>
plaque (a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease) at ten months of age, at fifteen
<br>
months when plaques substantially increase, and at twenty-one months when
<br>
extensive plaque occurs.  Control groups of mice were fed diets lacking
<br>
ibuprofen.  Memory was assessed by evalutating the animals' performance in
<br>
navigating a water maze at the beginning of the study and at two, five and
<br>
nine months.  Preliminary results of the study show that the mice given
<br>
ibuprofen at fifteen months and twenty-one months of age did not show the
<br>
age-dependent decline in cognitive function compared of the mice who did not
<br>
receive the drug.
<br>
<p>In another study presented at the meeting which was coauthored by the UCLA
<br>
researchers who also coauthored the study on ibuprofen, the herb curcumin
<br>
was tested in the same mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.  Curcumin is an
<br>
herb that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits,
<br>
and has been shown in some studies to be an effective tumor inhibitor.
<br>
Because nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use has been correlated with a
<br>
lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease, the intent of the researchers was to
<br>
investigate the possible efficacy against the disease of an agent which has
<br>
similar anti-inflammatory properties yet lacks the side effects of this
<br>
class of drugs.   The transgenic mice were given either 160 parts per
<br>
million or 5000 parts per million curcumin, and several markers of
<br>
inflammation and neurologic damage were measured.  Both the low and high
<br>
dose of curcumin lowered interleukin 1-B, an indicator of inflammation, by
<br>
57-62%.  The oxidation of protein also decreased.  Amyloid-beta plaque was
<br>
lowered by 43-50% with the lower dose of curcumin.  The loss of PSD-95, a
<br>
marker in the brain of a substance involved with cognitive function which
<br>
declines with age, appeared to be prevented by both doses of the herb.
<br>
Other markers are currently being studied.  The researchers conclude that
<br>
the efficacy and low toxicity of curcumin make it a potential preventive
<br>
against Alzheimer's disease.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Age-associated mental impairment (Cognitive enhancement)
<br>
<p>Age-associated mental impairment can range in severity from forgetfulness to
<br>
senility to dementia. It can be caused by a wide variety of specific disease
<br>
processes, many of which are treatable, or by life events, such as the loss
<br>
of a loved one. It can also result from brain aging. Whatever its form or
<br>
cause, it need not be accepted as a consequence of growing older.
<br>
<p>Behavioral modifications, such as increased physical and mental activity and
<br>
a healthy diet, can improve mental function both directly and indirectly by
<br>
enhancing overall health.
<br>
<p>Summary:
<br>
<p>1.  Determine the severity and duration of the mental impairment and consult
<br>
a physician if it interferes with daily functioning or has lasted a long
<br>
time.
<br>
2.  Determine whether the mental impairment is the result of a specific
<br>
disease process, which may be treatable, or life event, such as bereavement.
<br>
3.  Behavioral modifications, such as increased physical and mental activity
<br>
and a healthy diet, may be helpful. Correct any hearing or vision deficits
<br>
that interfere with activity.
<br>
4.  Utilize memory aids such as lists, routines, and actively making
<br>
connections to existing knowledge.
<br>
5.  Choline (2,500 to 10,000 mg a day) or lecithin (10,000 to 15,000 mg a
<br>
day), and/or phosphatidylcholine (1,200 to 6,000 mg a day) should be taken
<br>
early in the day. (Five Cognitex capsules a day supply the minimum dose of
<br>
these choline-based nutrients.)
<br>
6.  Take ginkgo biloba extract (120 mg a day), acetyl-L-carnitine (1,000 to
<br>
2,000 mg a day), and coenzyme Q10 (100 to 200 mg a day).
<br>
7.  Take Cognitex (5 capsules a day), which supplies pregnenolone, choline,
<br>
vitamin B5, phosphatidylserine, and vinpocetine. Refer to DHEA Replacement
<br>
Therapy protocol before using pregnenolone.
<br>
8. Take DHEA (25 to 50 mg a day). Refer to DHEA Replacement Therapy protocol
<br>
before initiating DHEA or pregnenolone replacement.
<br>
9.  Take melatonin (500 micrograms to 3 mg a night to maintain neurological
<br>
function; 3 to 10 mg a night for those who have an age-related degenerative
<br>
brain disease) one half hour before bedtime.
<br>
10.  Take Life Extension Mix (3 tablets with breakfast, 3 tablets with
<br>
lunch, 3 tablets with dinner) to provide vital antioxidants and vitamins.
<br>
11.  Take one or a combination of the following drugs: Picamilon (50 to 100
<br>
mg three times a day), Pyritinol (200 mg three times a day), piracetam
<br>
(2,400 to 4,800 mg a day), centrophenoxine (250 to 1,000 mg a day),
<br>
Hydergine (4 to 10 mg a day), deprenyl one 5 mg tablet two times per week,
<br>
and nimodipine (30 mg three times a day). Take nimodipine under the care of
<br>
a physician.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Super Curcumin with Bioperine
<br>
<p>Curcumin has become a popular dietary supplement, but users of the product
<br>
have only obtained partial benefits. The reason for this is that curcumin is
<br>
poorly assimilated into the bloodstream. This means that while the digestive
<br>
tract and liver derive benefit, the rest of the body is mostly denied. In a
<br>
study in which humans were given 2000 mg of curcumin, very little actually
<br>
made it into the bloodstream. When a small amount of piperine was combined
<br>
with curcumin, bioavailability was increased 2000%. This study was done on
<br>
both humans and animals and showed that piperine enhances the serum
<br>
concentration, extent of absorption and bioavailability of curcumin with no
<br>
adverse effects.

<br>
<p>CDP Choline
<br>
<p>Choline and pantothenic acid are substances needed by the brain to produce
<br>
acetylcholine, a major brain/motor neuron neurotransmitter that facilitates
<br>
the transmission of impulses between neurons.
<br>
<p>Choline chloride and phosphatidylcholine are two forms of choline that have
<br>
been the subject of most the research, some of which has shown that high
<br>
doses of choline are an effective way of achieving optimal acetylcholine
<br>
levels. Lower levels of acetylcholine are associated with memory loss and
<br>
learning difficulties that occur in aging brains. In one experiment,
<br>
university students improved test scores after taking supplemental choline.
<br>
<p>CDP-choline stands for cytidine-5-diphosphocholine. This unique form of
<br>
choline readily passes through the blood-brain barrier directly into the
<br>
brain tissue. Once past the BBB, CDP-choline activates the synthesis of
<br>
critical components in cell membranes, and enhances cerebral energy
<br>
metabolism.

<br>
<p>Use it or lose it:  Study examines the ways to combat aging of the brain
<br>
<p>It is never too late to learn something new. In fact, keeping the brain
<br>
alert with new challenging activities can prevent mental aging. People have
<br>
great fears of losing their mental capabilities during the aging process;
<br>
however, instead of worrying about losing their brain, people should
<br>
continually use it.
<br>
<p>&quot;We say, 'Use it or lose it,'&quot; said Dr. Kyle Allen, director of Summa Health
<br>
System's Center for Senior Health.
<br>
<p>Forget the myth that scientists once thought older brain was incapable of
<br>
generating new cell growth.
<br>
<p>Molly Wagster, program director of Neuropsychology of Aging, said &quot;We're in
<br>
flux about what we know about brains.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Neuropsychology of Aging for the National Institute on Aging is part of
<br>
the federal National Institutes of Health. Wagster pointed out that up until
<br>
the mid-1990s, researchers thought that people who were aging lost
<br>
considerable numbers of nerve cells in many parts of their brains.
<br>
Nevertheless, recent discoveries contradict that belief.
<br>
<p>With more advanced techniques, researchers found that normal older brains do
<br>
not appear to experience any major loss of the nerve cells, especially in
<br>
parts of the brain that are vital for learning and memory.
<br>
<p>Wagster responds to previous beliefs of the limitations of older brains,
<br>
&quot;That doesn't seem to be true. In fact, the old brain as well as the young
<br>
brain is capable of generation new nerve cells, particularly in the areas of
<br>
the brain that are important for leaning and memory.&quot;
