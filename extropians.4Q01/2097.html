<br>
<p>and I kinda like Doyne Farmer's thoughts, which begin:
<br>
<p>========
<br>
From: J. Doyne Farmer Date: 10.1.01
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to avert even worse disasters, we need to understand
<br>
what caused the events of Sept. 11. It's clear that Osama bin Laden is a
<br>
really bad guy, and these were really misguided people, and we need to do
<br>
something about disabling them in the future. But if we are to ever return
<br>
to a more lasting state of peace, we have to address the root causes of
<br>
terrorism. The best method to control something is to understand how it
<br>
works. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randomness and determinism are the poles that define the extremes
<br>
in any assignment of causality. Of course reality is usually somewhere in
<br>
between. Following Poincare', we say that something is random if the cause
<br>
seems to have little to do with the effect. Even though there is nothing
<br>
more deterministic than celestial mechanics, if someone gets hit in the
<br>
head by a meteor, we say this is bad luck, a random event, because their
<br>
head and the meteor had little to do with each other. Nobody threw the
<br>
meteor, and it could just as well have hit someone else. The corresponding
<br>
point of view here is that bin Laden and his associates are an anomaly, and
<br>
the fact that they are picking on us is just bad luck. We haven't done
<br>
anything wrong and there is no reason to change our behavior; if we can
<br>
just get rid of them, the problem will disappear. This is the view that we
<br>
would all rather believe because the remedy is much easier. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other pole is determinism: There were underlying causal
<br>
factors that led up to these events, and something like this was bound to
<br>
happen. This is a much harder view to swallow, because deterministic events
<br>
are by their very nature predictable and controllable. It leads to the
<br>
conclusion that we might have anticipated these events and done something
<br>
about it. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With any chaotic system there are two fundamentally different
<br>
approaches to prediction and control. One is to predict the detailed
<br>
trajectory that the system will take. For simple systems like roulette
<br>
wheels, turbulent fluids, and stock markets, I have a lot of experience
<br>
with this. To predict the trajectory of something, you have to understand
<br>
all the details and keep track of every little thing. This is like solving
<br>
terrorism by surveillance and security. Put a system in place that will
<br>
detect and track every terrorist and prevent them from acting. This is a
<br>
tempting solution, because it is easy to build a political consensus for
<br>
it, and it involves technology, which is something we are good at. But if
<br>
there is one thing I have learned in my twenty five years of trying to
<br>
predict chaotic systems, it is this: It is really hard, and it is
<br>
fundamentally impossible to do it well. 
<br>
<p>==========
<br>
<p>`The corresponding point of view here is that bin Laden and his associates
<br>
are an anomaly, and the fact that they are picking on us is just bad luck.
<br>
We haven't done anything wrong and there is no reason to change our
<br>
behavior; if we can just get rid of them, the problem will disappear.' This
<br>
appears to be John Clark's view. It's just possibly insufficiently... complex.
