<p>
Many of us spend a significant amount of our 24 hour day in our home so,
<br>
what if a tube was put in an outside wall (or even the floor) that was of an
<br>
internal dimension to any available effective filters, and a positive flow
<br>
into the home was provided with a low voltage fan, ac adaptor with battery
<br>
backup.
<br>
<p>The tube could be designed so that pushing a new filter in from the interior
<br>
side would push an expired filter outside, so as not to breach sterility,
<br>
this seems to cover a percentage chance of exposure.
<br>
could also put filters in car interior intake vent fans also, in case of
<br>
inadvertent driving thru contaminated areas, keeping a radio tuned to a
<br>
local news station 24/7 might be effective for early warning.
<br>
<p>Someone have any advice as to how I sell this idea to the executive branch
<br>
of my family ( the high priestess )?
