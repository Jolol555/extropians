Thanks Nick for this idea, one of the most interesting
<br>
I have seen recently. &lt;snip&gt;

<p>No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, no one saw the bamboo canoe sink into the sacred mud, but in a few days
<br>
there was no one who did not know that the taciturn man came from the South and that his home had been one of those
<br>
numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of the mountain, where the Zend language has not been contaminated by
<br>
Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What is certain is that the grey man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank with pushing
<br>
aside (probably, without feeling) the blades which were lacerating his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and bloodstained, up to
<br>
the circular enclosure crowned with a stone tiger or horse, which sometimes was the color of flame and now was that of
<br>
ashes. This circle was a temple which had been devoured by ancient fires, profaned by the miasmal jungle, and whose god no
<br>
longer received the homage of men. The stranger stretched himself out beneath the pedestal. He was awakened by the sun high
<br>
overhead. He was not astonished to find that his wounds had healed; he closed his pallid eyes and slept, not through
<br>
weakness of flesh but through determination of will. He knew that this temple was the place required for his invincible
<br>
intent; he knew that the incessant trees had not succeeded in strangling the ruins of another propitious temple downstream
<br>
which had once belonged to gods now burned and dead; he knew that his immediate obligation was to dream. Toward midnight he
<br>
was awakened by the inconsolable shriek of a bird. Tracks of bare feet, some figs and a jug warned him that the men of the
<br>
region had been spying respectfully on his sleep, soliciting his protection or afraid of his magic. He felt a chill of fear,
<br>
and sought out a sepulchral niche in the dilapidated wall where he concealed himself among unfamiliar leaves.
<br>
<p>The purpose which guided him was not impossible, though supernatural. He wanted to dream a man; he wanted to dream him in
<br>
minute entirety and impose him on reality. This magic project had exhausted the entire expanse of his mind; if someone had
<br>
asked him his name or to relate some event of his former life, he would not have been able to give an answer. This
<br>
uninhabited, ruined temple suited him, for it is contained a minimum of visible world; the proximity of the workmen also
<br>
suited him, for they took it upon themselves to provide for his frugal needs. The rice and fruit they brought him were
<br>
nourishment enough for his body, which was consecrated to the sole task of sleeping and dreaming.
<br>
<p>At first, his dreams were chaotic; then in a short while they became dialectic in nature. The stranger dreamed that he was
<br>
in the center of a circular amphitheater which was more or less the burnt temple; clouds of taciturn students filled the
<br>
tiers of seats; the faces of the farthest ones hung at a distance of many centuries and as high as the stars, but their
<br>
features were completely precise. The man lectured his pupils on anatomy, cosmography, and magic: the faces listened
<br>
anxiously and tried to answer understandingly, as if they guessed the importance of that examination which would redeem one
<br>
of them from his condition of empty illusion and interpolate him into the real world. Asleep or awake, the man thought over
<br>
the answers of his phantoms, did not allow himself to be deceived by imposters, and in certain perplexities he sensed a
<br>
growing intelligence. He was seeking a soul worthy of participating in the universe.
<br>
<p>After nine or ten nights he understood with a certain bitterness that he could expect nothing from those pupils who accepted
<br>
his doctrine passively, but that he could expect something from those who occasionally dared to oppose him. The former
<br>
group, although worthy of love and affection, could not ascend to the level of individuals; the latter pre-existed to a
<br>
slightly greater degree. One afternoon (now afternoons were also given over to sleep, now he was only awake for a couple
<br>
hours at daybreak) he dismissed the vast illusory student body for good and kept only one pupil. He was a taciturn, sallow
<br>
boy, at times intractable, and whose sharp features resembled of those of his dreamer. The brusque elimination of his fellow
<br>
students did not disconcert him for long; after a few private lessons, his progress was enough to astound the teacher.
<br>
Nevertheless, a catastrophe took place. One day, the man emerged from his sleep as if from a viscous desert, looked at the
<br>
useless afternoon light which he immediately confused with the dawn, and understood that he had not dreamed. All that night
<br>
and all day long, the intolerable lucidity of insomnia fell upon him. He tried exploring the forest, to lose his strength;
<br>
among the hemlock he barely succeeded in experiencing several short snatchs of sleep, veined with fleeting, rudimentary
<br>
visions that were useless. He tried to assemble the student body but scarcely had he articulated a few brief words of
<br>
exhortation when it became deformed and was then erased. In his almost perpetual vigil, tears of anger burned his old eyes.
<br>
<p>He understood that modeling the incoherent and vertiginous matter of which dreams are composed was the most difficult task
<br>
that a man could undertake, even though he should penetrate all the enigmas of a superior and inferior order; much more
<br>
difficult than weaving a rope out of sand or coining the faceless wind. He swore he would forget the enormous hallucination
<br>
which had thrown him off at first, and he sought another method of work. Before putting it into execution, he spent a month
<br>
recovering his strength, which had been squandered by his delirium. He abandoned all premeditation of dreaming and almost
<br>
immediately succeeded in sleeping a reasonable part of each day. The few times that he had dreams during this period, he
<br>
paid no attention to them. Before resuming his task, he waited until the moon's disk was perfect. Then, in the afternoon, he
<br>
purified himself in the waters of the river, worshiped the planetary gods, pronounced the prescribed syllables of a mighty
<br>
name, and went to sleep. He dreamed almost immediately, with his heart throbbing.
<br>
<p>He dreamed that it was warm, secret, about the size of a clenched fist, and of a garnet color within the penumbra of a human
<br>
body as yet without face or sex; during fourteen lucid nights he dreampt of it with meticulous love. Every night he
<br>
perceived it more clearly. He did not touch it; he only permitted himself to witness it, to observe it, and occasionally to
<br>
rectify it with a glance. He perceived it and lived it from all angles and distances. On the fourteenth night he lightly
<br>
touched the pulmonary artery with his index finger, then the whole heart, outside and inside. He was satisfied with the
<br>
examination. He deliberately did not dream for a night; he took up the heart again, invoked the name of a planet, and
<br>
undertook the vision of another of the principle organs. Within a year he had come to the skeleton and the eyelids. The
<br>
innumerable hair was perhaps the most difficult task. He dreamed an entire man--a young man, but who did not sit up or talk,
<br>
who was unable to open his eyes. Night after night, the man dreamt him asleep.
<br>
<p>In the Gnostic cosmosgonies, demiurges fashion a red Adam who cannot stand; as a clumsy, crude and elemental as this Adam of
<br>
dust was the Adam of dreams forged by the wizard's nights. One afternoon, the man almost destroyed his entire work, but then
<br>
changed his mind. (It would have been better had he destroyed it.) When he had exhausted all supplications to the deities of
<br>
earth, he threw himself at the feet of the effigy which was perhaps a tiger or perhaps a colt and implored its unknown help.
<br>
That evening, at twilight, he dreamt of the statue. He dreamt it was alive, tremulous: it was not an atrocious bastard of a
<br>
tiger and a colt, but at the same time these two firey creatures and also a bull, a rose, and a storm. This multiple god
<br>
revealed to him that his earthly name was Fire, and that in this circular temple (and in others like it) people had once
<br>
made sacrifices to him and worshiped him, and that he would magically animate the dreamed phantom, in such a way that all
<br>
creatures, except Fire itself and the dreamer, would believe to be a man of flesh and blood. He commanded that once this man
<br>
had been instructed in all the rites, he should be sent to the other ruined temple whose pyramids were still standing
<br>
downstream, so that some voice would glorify him in that deserted ediface. In the dream of the man that dreamed, the dreamed
<br>
one awoke.
<br>
<p>The wizard carried out the orders he had been given. He devoted a certain length of time (which finally proved to be two
<br>
years) to instructing him in the mysteries of the universe and the cult of fire. Secretly, he was pained at the idea of
<br>
being seperated from him. On the pretext of pedagogical necessity, each day he increased the number of hours dedicated to
<br>
dreaming. He also remade the right shoulder, which was somewhat defective. At times, he was disturbed by the impression that
<br>
all this had already happened . . . In general, his days were happy; when he closed his eyes, he thought: Now I will be with
<br>
my son. Or, more rarely: The son I have engendered is waiting for me and will not exist if I do not go to him.
<br>
<p>Gradually, he began accustoming him to reality. Once he ordered him to place a flag on a faraway peak. The next day the flag
<br>
was fluttering on the peak. He tried other analogous experiments, each time more audacious. With a certain bitterness, he
<br>
understood that his son was ready to be born--and perhaps impatient. That night he kissed him for the first time and sent
<br>
him off to the other temple whose remains were turning white downstream, across many miles of inextricable jungle and
<br>
marshes. Before doing this (and so that his son should never know that he was a phantom, so that he should think himself a
<br>
man like any other) he destroyed in him all memory of his years of apprenticeship.
<br>
<p>His victory and peace became blurred with boredom. In the twilight times of dusk and dawn, he would prostrate himself before
<br>
the stone figure, perhaps imagining his unreal son carrying out identical rites in other circular ruins downstream; at night
<br>
he no longer dreamed, or dreamed as any man does. His perceptions of the sounds and forms of the universe became somewhat
<br>
pallid: his absent son was being nourished by these diminution of his soul. The purpose of his life had been fulfilled; the
<br>
man remained in a kind of ecstasy. After a certain time, which some chronicles prefer to compute in years and others in
<br>
decades, two oarsmen awoke him at midnight; he could not see their faces, but they spoke to him of a charmed man in a temple
<br>
of the North, capable of walking on fire without burning himself. The wizard suddenly remembered the words of the god. He
<br>
remembered that of all the creatures that people the earth, Fire was the only one who knew his son to be a phantom. This
<br>
memory, which at first calmed him, ended by tormenting him. He feared lest his son should meditate on this abnormal
<br>
privilege and by some means find out he was a mere simulacrum. Not to be a man, to be a projection of another man's
<br>
dreams--what an incomparable humiliation, what madness! Any father is interested in the sons he has procreated (or
<br>
permitted) out of the mere confusion of happiness; it was natural that the wizard should fear for the future of that son
<br>
whom he had thought out entrail by entrail, feature by feature, in a thousand and one secret nights.
<br>
<p>His misgivings ended abruptly, but not without certain forewarnings. First (after a long drought) a remote cloud, as light
<br>
as a bird, appeared on a hill; then, toward the South, the sky took on the rose color of leopard's gums; then came clouds of
<br>
smoke which rusted the metal of the nights; afterwards came the panic-stricken flight of wild animals. For what had happened
<br>
many centuries before was repeating itself. The ruins of the sanctuary of the god of Fire was destroyed by fire. In a dawn
<br>
without birds, the wizard saw the concentric fire licking the walls. For a moment, he thought of taking refuge in the water,
<br>
but then he understood that death was coming to crown his old age and absolve him from his labors. He walked toward the
<br>
sheets of flame. They did not bite his flesh, they caressed him and flooded him without heat or combustion. With relief,
<br>
with humiliation, with terror, he understood that he also was an illusion, that someone else was dreaming him.
