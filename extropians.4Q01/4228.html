<em>&gt; I share that fear considering what will happen if the current

</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic free-choice this will result in the proliferation of

</em><br>
<p>What meaning do you put in the word 'society'? Do you mean it like many
<br>
swedes would use it, as 'the government', or in the wider sense of 'our
<br>
social environment'? In the first case, the solution is fairly clear:
<br>
make sure the government is not allowed to interfere with our
<br>
reproductive choices in any way. In the second case (which seems more
<br>
likely) you have the problem of claiming it determines what humans are
<br>
born *in detail*. Sure, there are prevalent ideals and values that
<br>
affect the decisions of parents, but they do not control them 100% -
<br>
given the diversity of modern societies we instead see that while most
<br>
people do like most others do, there are a sizeable fraction that behave
<br>
in other ways. While there are many pressures to conform, there are also
<br>
counterpressures for individuality and rebellion. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In short, we are in a sort of Catch-22.  We can't seem to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too much better without getting smarter and more capable and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't get smarter and more capable without using certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies with more wisdom than we generally possess.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are seeing things as a vicious circle, while I think it is a
<br>
positive feedback loop: if people can help themselves a bit with
<br>
technology, that will affect society in positive ways that will in turn
<br>
help develop better technology, and so on. There may still be unwanted
<br>
side effects, but in general society seems to be made up of a
<br>
sufficiently complex mixture of people and views not to get trapped in
<br>
dead ends very easily. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2) the assumption that things will get worse if humans are allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take responsibility for them. This is largely based on the ease we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; come up with bad scenarios and examples of mistreatments in the past,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; while leaving out all the good things. One reason is of course that good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; news are not very exciting, so they do not get trumpeted about as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or written about in history books. But there is also an assumption here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that mankind is always fallen, and increased freedom always must result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in increased evil actions rather than increased evil and good actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't assume things would get worse.  I simply assume, based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a lot of observation, that some pretty screw things will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done with any powerful new technology, not just or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily predominantly good things.  There is reason for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caution and safeguards. 
</em><br>
<p>Sure. Note that my criticisms of the idea that we are socially better
<br>
off unable to change ourselves are not directed at you or anybody else,
<br>
but the idea itself. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3) The assumption that the best way of handling this potential risk is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to abstain from a technology that could be bad in a repressive society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than seek to deal with the repressive society. If we are worried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about sexism, maybe we should see what we can do about sexism in our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society. If we are worried about cloning being used to create carbon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; copy people, maybe the right way to handle it is to strengthen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individualism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not so much worried about a repressive society as about not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially wise or more or less rational or ethical human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and human organizations wielding powers increasingly able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really screw us up in perhaps a terminal degree. 
</em><br>
<p>Then the question is: who can we allow to wield these technologies? 
<br>
<p>The relinquishment argument answers 'nobody', but that clearly fails
<br>
since it is enough for somebody to develop a technology and the genie is
<br>
out of the bottle. 
<br>
<p>The answer 'the government, since they are elected by the people' is
<br>
popular, but has the problem that even a democratic government may
<br>
misbehave due to public choice effects, lack of accountability and
<br>
especially its top-down, one-size fits all approach. The real danger in
<br>
centralized schemes is that there is a single point of failure
<br>
(accountability and power division lessens this problem a bit, but does
<br>
not wholly remove it), and a bad decision made will affect all. 
<br>
<p>Another answer to the question is 'the people themselves'. This has the
<br>
advantage of being a bottom-up, self-organizing approach, where local
<br>
information and individual values can be used by people. It also implies
<br>
that bad values or stupid people will affect technology use; whether
<br>
this is disastrous or not depends very much on the technology: if
<br>
individual people make bad reproductory choices it will affect them and
<br>
their families, while dangerous experiments with black holes in the
<br>
kitchen may threaten everybody. In situations where the effects of
<br>
misuse are limited and can be curbed by holding users accountable, this
<br>
approach seems preferrable to the government approach, and I think this
<br>
holds true for many reproductive technologies. It is less clear how well
<br>
it works for black holes. 
<br>
<p>There are general ways of making people behave more rationally and
<br>
ethically, such as accountability, transparency and setting up
<br>
institutions which, while fallible, help bias behavior in beneficial
<br>
ways and protect from the effects of mistakes (insurance companies, for
<br>
example). I think more thought on how such means can be applied in
<br>
reproduction would be helpful. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Another (somewhat unrelated) scary thought experiment:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; People fear cloning/GE used to produce &quot;designer humans&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are better than organic/natural humans.  Has anyone discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the fear of using cloning/GE as a weapon?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not worry about super-soldiers.  I do worry about people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become obsolete and no consideration given to their well-being. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether they are made obsolete by genetic design of superior new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans or by AI or robotics or something else is immaterial to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basic concern.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't the issue really lack of concern for their well-being, rather than
<br>
being made obsolete? If I become obsolete in some sense, it might be a
<br>
blow to my self-esteem, but if I can still grow and flourish as a human
<br>
being I am still well off.
