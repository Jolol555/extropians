</em><br>
<p>I think it was more in the order of 20-40 million people died of the
<br>
Spanish flu. The public hygeine behaviors you cite are generally the
<br>
result of centuries of living with no cures, especially the 1850-1950
<br>
period when viruses and bacteria were understood to cause disease but
<br>
few cures were available. Now that cures are more common, its not so
<br>
rude to cough near someone else.
<br>
<p>As one who grew up with severe allergies as a kid, I can say it really
<br>
stinks to be treated as a contagious carrier during pollen season.
