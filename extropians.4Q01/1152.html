<p>It is hard to imagine that anybody could say anything so stupid on this 
<br>
list. Randy you are such a jerk -- you wouldn't even be an American if 
<br>
there hadn't been any immigration to that continent.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Miriam&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Er...OK ::deep breath::
<br>
&nbsp;You need to draw a clear distinction between
<br>
&quot;immigration&quot; in the nice clean 21rst century
<br>
usuage...and the bad bad word.
<br>
&nbsp;Conquest.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not &quot;petition the Natives&quot; for entrance
<br>
to their social systems. We did not seek to use
<br>
their tax base (laughable thought that!).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We displaced them with extreme prejiduce.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We took the tools of a technological society
<br>
and turned NorAm into a place that the preexisting
<br>
peoples wouldn't even recognize. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We displaced them just like they displaced the
<br>
ones who were there before them (some of whom,
<br>
it seems, were caucasian, though it doesn't matter
<br>
much persay).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my ancestors immigrating... well most of
<br>
my family came, and they assimilated. The welfare
<br>
systems were not in place then, and my family
<br>
ostracizes any members who use them to this day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't need multitudes of immigrants straining
<br>
our society at this point, not right now.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were going to accept lots of immigrants
<br>
we should focus on the sort of scources we used
<br>
to focus on. There are lots of good potential 
<br>
immigrants in South Africa and Rhodesia for
<br>
example. Or Eastern Europe. Folks who would
<br>
move things in a positive direction.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boers have some spine still. We could use
<br>
people whose ancestors pulled off the Great Trek.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike many of the folks (here and abroad) who
<br>
play with America's demographics in the name of
<br>
abstract &quot;ideals&quot; straight out of Das Kapital.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I call people like that.. ah yes &quot;jerks&quot;..
<br>
and remarkably they say &quot;stupid things on this list&quot;
<br>
from time to time.  Randy isn't one of them however.
