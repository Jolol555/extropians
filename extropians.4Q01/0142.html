<em>&gt; &gt; Down With Democracy by Hans-Hermann Hoppe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Wow.  That's an ... amazing ... rant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you know something? It makes sense! It's wonderful, it's internally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent, and it has completely converted me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, following Hoppe's plan to its logical conclusion I urge you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; join me behind this rallying cry: bring back the feudal monarchy RIGHT NOW!
</em><br>
<p>At the limit, libertarianism is in fact monarchy of land owners, and
<br>
some of us don't have a problem with that even after we realize it.
<br>
The problem with traditional monarchy was not the form of governance
<br>
itself, but the fact that their business was generally robbing from
<br>
the neighbors, enslaving the peasants, and skipping out on their debts
<br>
by &quot;divine right&quot;. Embed feudalisms in a culture in which everyone
<br>
understands that even the monarchs are subject to fair play, and in
<br>
wich the peasants have the wealth and technology (or influence over
<br>
competing monarchs) to enforce that, and every kingdom is available to
<br>
the highest bidder, and it becomes a pretty good place to live.
