<em>&gt; From: Amara Graps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S. That old adage: &quot;The map is not the territory&quot; might apply here.
</em><br>
<p>Alfred Korzybski [&quot;General Semantics, Psychiatry, Psycotherapy
<br>
and Preventio&quot;; America Journal of Psychiatry; 98, (1941), 203-214]
<br>
said that (1) a map is not the territory, (2) a map does not represent all 
<br>
of a territory, (3) a map is self-reflexive in the sense that an 'ideal' map 
<br>
would include a map of the map, etc., indefinitely. 
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Statement ((2) is wrong. A map which represent all of a
<br>
territory is a &quot;contraction&quot; but not a &quot;contradiction&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Stephan Banach [&quot;Sur les Operations dans les Ensembles Abstraits
<br>
et leur Applications aux Equations Integrales&quot;; Fundamenta Mathematicae;
<br>
3, (1922), 7-33] showed that in every good map (&quot;contraction&quot;) a single, 
<br>
unique point of the territory must be represented on the map. 
<br>
<p>Statement (3) was stolen from Josiah Royce [&quot;The World and the Individual&quot;,
<br>
New York: MacMillan &amp; Co., Ltd., 1899].
<br>
<p>J. A. Suarez Miranda [that is to say... J.L. Borges (*)] wrote the interesting 
<br>
&quot;Travels of Praiseworthy Men&quot; (1658) in which:
<br>
&quot;...In that Empire, the craft of Cartography attained such Perfection 
<br>
that the Map of a Single province covered the space of an entire City, 
<br>
and the Map of the Empire itself an entire Province. In the course of 
<br>
Time, these Extensive maps were found somehow wanting, and so 
<br>
the College of Cartographers evolved a Map of the Empire that was 
<br>
of the same Scale as the Empire and that coincided with it point 
<br>
for point. Less attentive to the Study of Cartography, succeeding 
<br>
Generations came to judge a map of such Magnitude cumbersome, 
<br>
and, not without Irreverence, they abandoned it to the Rigours of 
<br>
Sun and Rain. In the western Deserts, tattered Fragments of the 
<br>
Map are still to be found, Sheltering an occasional Beast or beggar; 
<br>
in the whole Nation, no other relic is left of the Discipline of Geography.&quot;
<br>
<p>(*) &quot;Of Exactitude in Science&quot;
<br>
The piece was written by Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares. 
<br>
English translation quoted from J. L. Borges, &quot;A Universal History of Infamy&quot;, 
<br>
Penguin Books, London, 1975.
<br>
<p>And Italo Calvino was a good second. From 'Invisible Cities' (1972) 
<br>
&quot;VI, Cities and the sky.&quot; 
<br>
&quot;In Eudossia, that extends up and low, with meandering alleys, steps, narrow 
<br>
lanes, hovels, a carpet is kept in which you can contemplate the real shape 
<br>
of the city. At first nothing seems to resemble less Eudossia than the 
<br>
design of the carpet, ordered in symmetrical figures that repeat their 
<br>
patterns along straight and circular lines, woven of needleful of dazzling 
<br>
colors, which alternating wefts you can follow all along the warp. But if 
<br>
you stop to observe it with attention, you perceive that to every place of 
<br>
the carpet corresponds a place of the city and that all the things contained 
<br>
in the city are comprised in the design, arranged according to their true 
<br>
relationships, which escape to your eye distracted from the coming and going 
<br>
from the swarming from the awful crush. All the confusion in Eudossia, the 
<br>
bray of the mules, the spots of lamp-black, the smell of fish, is what 
<br>
appear in the partial perspective that you pick; but the carpet proves that 
<br>
there is a point from which the city shows its true proportions, the 
<br>
geometric outline implicit in its every minimal detail. 
<br>
Getting lost in Eudossia is easy: but when you concentrates staring the 
<br>
carpet you recognize the road that you were looking for in a crimson or 
<br>
indigo or amaranth thread that through a long round lets you enter in a 
<br>
purple fence that is your true point of arrival. Every inhabitant of 
<br>
Eudossia confronts to the immovable order of the carpet his own image of the 
<br>
city, an anguish, and everyone can find hidden between the arabesques an 
<br>
answer, the story of his life, the twists of his destiny. 
<br>
An oracle was consultated about the mysterious relationship between two such 
<br>
different objects as the carpet and the city. One of the two objects, - it 
<br>
was the response, - has the shape that the gods gave to the starry sky and 
<br>
to the orbits around which the worlds spin; the other one is an approximate 
<br>
glare, like every human work. 
<br>
The augurs since so long were sure that the harmonic design of the carpet 
<br>
was of divine nature; in this sense the oracle was interpreted, without 
<br>
giving place to controversies. But in the same way you can draw the opposite 
<br>
conclusion: that the real map of the universe is the city of Eudossia as it 
<br>
is, a spot that spreads without shape, with zigzag roads, houses collapsing 
<br>
above one another in the dust, fires, cries in the dark.&quot;
