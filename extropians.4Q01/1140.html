<p><p>Well, on a tangent to that, let me address a particularly unsavory aspect of 
<br>
immigration into America as it relates to the nature of the the male psyche, 
<br>
for lack of a word or phrase.  The human male is a bit like a gamble, 
<br>
psychological speaking.  There is a bit of a bell curve thing going on 
<br>
there.  All aspects of human behavior are found in the human male, but male 
<br>
behavior tends to spread out over the spectrum of human behavior...in other 
<br>
words, you really get all kinds.  Out of 100 million males, a certain 
<br>
percentage are going to be psychos, and many of them will be functional 
<br>
psychos.
<br>
<p>Now let's imagine ourselves in their shoes...in their 3rd world shoes, if 
<br>
they live in the third world.  These people are not rich, probably not going 
<br>
to be successful.  Where are they going to go? To America!
<br>
America has made itself a magnet for every misfit in the 3rd world. How very 
<br>
enviable.
