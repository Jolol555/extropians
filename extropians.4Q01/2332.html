</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is a good start. 
<br>
<p>Affecting the consequences is an interesting area. As I have said, some
<br>
views claim that this undermines freedom altogether even when the change
<br>
is to make some consequences *better* than others; I disagree with that,
<br>
the freedom to act according to the pre-change values is always there.
<br>
On the other hand, making certain choices worse makes it impossible to
<br>
achieve the pre-change values, and quite often threaten or remove
<br>
important freedoms (like threatening you with violence if you make a
<br>
certain choice). 
<br>
<p>Real coercion of course involves interfering directly with the decision
<br>
process, not just biasing it but by removing certain choices or
<br>
circumventing the decision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would defend the extropian enterprise this way. The current lifestyles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not self-sustaining or self-sustainable, thus the choice of remaining 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in those lifestyles is not available anyway. What we're trying to do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve a lifestyle, for ourselves and others, that does offer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest range of choices, compared to the alternatives that are possible.
</em><br>
<p>After all, extropians have always been for sustainable development. Most
<br>
other views doesn't care about limited resources like the sun (just a
<br>
few billion years left!) or baryonic matter with proton decay. In the
<br>
really long run we are the true environmentalists :-)
<br>
<p>Seriously, I think seeking to enlarge the range of possible choices and
<br>
the potential value of these choices is a good core principle. We need
<br>
to balance it with a commensurate increase in ability to evaluate
<br>
choices (or stand the undertainty in making choices), of course, but
<br>
having more possibilities is in general preferable to having less. 
<br>
<p>Note that this also provides an answer to those who fear that we will
<br>
force everybody with us: we seek to make it possible to ignore us
<br>
totally too. It is always good to have a control group or reserve in
<br>
case the transhuman project fails in one way or another (or if it turns
<br>
out that there *is* an objective morality, and it is derived from the
<br>
Old Testament).
