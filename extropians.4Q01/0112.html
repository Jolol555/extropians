<p>BANG! &quot;Captain, our semantic shields took a serious hit but the hull

<p>Be careful where you point loaded words like that. The definition of
<br>
health, disease and illness is a tricky business, and quite important to
<br>
do right if we want to win over the mainstream to our way of thinking.
<br>
While it is effective to proclaim something to be a disease, it is also
<br>
risky since it may open the door to allow anything to be declared a
<br>
disease (&quot;Drapetomania, the irrational desire of slaves to run away&quot; -
<br>
common mental disease in the 18'th century).
<br>
<p>I suggest looking up Frietas' _Nanomedicine_ for an accessible
<br>
discussion of how we can define health/illness. I think he makes a great
<br>
point about his volitional normative disease model, where health is
<br>
defined as optimal functioning according to our own personal ideas -
<br>
that would make aging a disease *to those seeing it as undesirable*. It
<br>
has a subjective component, which is fair (I'm not certain I would want
<br>
to be cured from the Gourmand Syndrome if I got it) and provides a
<br>
deeper foundation for arguing that aging is something we should rid
<br>
ourselves off. Having a good health/illness model to base our arguments
<br>
on, we can argue both for morphological freedom and immortalism based on
<br>
the same medical philosophy, and the attackers will have to deal with
<br>
the central model rather than just take potshots at individual
<br>
transhumanist projects. 
<br>
<p>We are going to need firm foundations when we get into the mainstream
<br>
discussion. Related issues are already hotly debated when it comes to
<br>
various controversial illnesses like ADHD, the push to declare
<br>
age-related memory impariment an illness and what health care services
<br>
to provide. Messy, dirty but important business if we want to live
<br>
forever. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What we need is a separate, and well-defended nation founded on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational principles and governed in an anarcho-capitalist manner so we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can all move there and carry on our work, giving the rest of humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some time and space to catch up.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, this seems to be the solution to *every* problem here on the list.
<br>
<p>&quot;Captain, the irony unit is overheating!&quot; &quot;Quick, drop some paperwork on
<br>
it!&quot;
