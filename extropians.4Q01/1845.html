<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; His, point is that there are no interests of society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which are different from the interests of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; individuals.  There is no society at all without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; individuals.  I have often pointed out that society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is only a collection of individuals.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;### I wouldn't agree with the claim that the society &gt;is just a collection of individuals anymore than say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that my body is just a collection of cells.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so you don't agree.  The analogy between individuals in society and cells in the body is just an analogy.  It is nothing more
<br>
than that.  It is not even a very good analogy in my opinion.  But even if you think it is a great analogy, that does not mean that
<br>
what is true of the body is true of society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, I could imagine changing my body as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts of my mind and still maintain my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity.
</em><br>
<p>So?  Some people can move out of a city and others move in and the city could still be called a society.  This supports your point,
<br>
but it does not contradict the point that Von Mises and I make that the relationship between individuals is fundamentally different
<br>
than the relationship between cells in the body.  Do cells negotiate prices?  Do cells pass laws?  Do cells enter into contracts?
<br>
The analogy breaks down here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I could get rid of all my so selfish genes by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading and continue my existence.
</em><br>
<p>Uploading?  I presume you mean storing your &quot;personality&quot; or &quot;mind&quot; in some sort of artificial means.  If you ever discover a way to
<br>
do this, please let me know. It would be a major breakthrough.  As you may know there is currently no technology anywhere in
<br>
existence which can do this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, a sufficiently developed human society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could get rid of all its starting components,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substituting for them minds designed to function and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive only within the society.  Such specialized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities would not have their own, independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival instincts and would be wholly and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciously devoted to the survival of the society.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, the technology to do this does not exist either at the present time.  But if you care to speculate on it, go ahead.  If
<br>
it could be done, would the result be a society of human beings or one big organism which was really only a single individual?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just like the skin cells on my feet are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slaves of the neurons in my brain but rather co
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-workers in a common undertaking (putting their genes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through to the next generation),
</em><br>
<p>I hope you recognize that &quot;co-workers in a common undertaking&quot; is just an analogy.  In my opinion it is not a very useful analogy.
<br>
Co-workers in a common undertaking are, in real life, individual thinking human beings who have their own motives and desires.  It
<br>
is because they have their own goals that they can decide to work together when their own goals can best be served by cooperation
<br>
with others and vice versa.  The cells in the body have no conscious goals, do not determine that they should work together to
<br>
achieve them and therefore we should not be surprised to find that the analogy to co-workers is not very accurate.  You are right
<br>
that the analogy of masters and slaves is also highly inaccurate.  In fact ANY analogy between cells in the body and thinking
<br>
individual human beings is bound to be misleading.  Some folks seem mighty fond of the analogy anyway.
<br>
<p>By the way, you might want to clarify what would happen to ordinary old fashioned &quot;entities&quot; such as the sort of human beings who
<br>
are walking around on Earth today if you or someone else were to somehow get the technology to start &quot;designing&quot; sub-human
<br>
&quot;entities&quot; to be like cells in a superorganism.  Other people who have had similar ideas usually wanted to start with ordinary
<br>
people as their raw material.  The crimes of such social engineers (mass murder of millions of people) were so vast that folks on
<br>
this planet are still a bit touchy on the subject.  Please clarify whether you intend to leave old fashioned individuals to do their
<br>
own thing or some of us might become somewhat hostile.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the minds making up the supersociety would not be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;oppressed, externally controlled or deceived victims
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a tyranny.
</em><br>
<p>But would they be minds?  Cells in the body are not.  And if they are minds, would they be willing to accept the role you have in
<br>
mind?  If they are somehow genetically or psychologically deprived of their independent will to survive (as you suggested earlier)
<br>
would they survive?
<br>
<p>And if this whole wild scheme could succeed (which is in doubt) would it be a good thing?  Or would it be a monstrous, inhuman evil?
<br>
<p>You can be sure that creating a race of &quot;entities&quot; with no instinct for self-preservation, if it could even be done, would
<br>
inevitably result in the deaths of many of them.  Why would this be a good thing?  You talk as though these &quot;entities&quot; will be
<br>
intelligent yet currently the only source of intelligence is living human beings.  Yes, there is research being done on artificial
<br>
intelligence but so far it has not succeeded.  So in the meantime is there any way you could do this without trying to somehow
<br>
genetically or psychologically mess up a human child to have no instinct for preservation?  And if you did that and the child died
<br>
because of it would you have done something wrong?  Of course, a true &quot;superorganism&quot; would need many, many such children.  I hope
<br>
the ethical issues are more obvious now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They would be supremely conscious of their situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and would be designed to be earnestly willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perform their duties. At least I think so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- I would find it hard to imagine that the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general intelligence you can build needs to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivational mechanisms similar to ours, primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focused on individual survival.
</em><br>
<p>You find it hard to imagine.  Consider this theory.  Maybe you just lack sufficient imagination.  If intelligence could exist
<br>
without being focused on individual survival, why has not such a thing evolved?  Could it be that it's impossible?  Could it be that
<br>
it is not as successful as the kind of intelligence we have?  Or maybe it's just a matter of chance and such a thing will arise
<br>
someday.
<br>
<p>By the way, does all this interest in a &quot;supersociety&quot; or &quot;superorganism&quot; stem from some dissatisfaction with your life as an
<br>
individual human being?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We, humans are somewhat similar to slime molds (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned on the site being referred to) because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can and usually are willing to survive outside of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial cultural environments.
</em><br>
<p>A disgusting analogy, but certainly less misleading and less inaccurate than the cells in a body analogy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The cells of our bodies are fully committed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare of the whole body,
</em><br>
<p>Committed?  I think you might want to reconsider the definition of the word committed.  It implies a conscious decision and will.  I
<br>
suggest that cells in the body do not have any such thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and, just think about how much more than slime molds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can these cells achieve.
</em><br>
<p>Here is where two bad analogies lead you to illogical conclusions.  Just because slime mold sounds disgusting to us as human beings
<br>
and does not do any of the things that we as human beings find really laudable does not mean that we should want to be cells in a
<br>
body rather than whole human beings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As Anders mentioned earlier, the universe does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care about our wishes. It is possible that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman form of consciousness best adapted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive over long periods of time might be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supersociety rather than the society of free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals as we know them.
</em><br>
<p>True.  It is also highly possible that a transhuman form of consciousness best adapted to long term surival might consist of free
<br>
thinking individuals.  The history of the past several hundred million years indicates this is the most likely scenario.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The supersociety is not morally superior and has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of an idependent claim to existence than we or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slime molds have but it could work so much better as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make us obsolete.
</em><br>
<p>What evidence, if any, is there for this?  My own studies of history, biology, evolution and anthropology lead me to suspect that
<br>
what you call a &quot;supersociety&quot; where individualism fades, would be fatally flawed and could never compete with individuals.
<br>
Probably not even with individual animals but definitely not with individuals of an intelligent species.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this is true, then only the cosmic equivalents of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rotting logs would offer ecological niches for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualistic transhumans.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, but IF your assumptions were true, outright extinction or evolution into a &quot;supersociety&quot; would be far more likely than any
<br>
form of survival.  But are these ideas true?  Would a collective &quot;supersociety&quot; where individuals are no more than cells in a body
<br>
be superior?  Why on Earth would we think so?  Yes, it is a thought which challenges our assumptions and makes us think.  But having
<br>
thought about it and being entertained or elightened or horrified by the thought, let us consider whether there is any evidence at
<br>
all for this hypothesis.  Of course we don't have enough evidence to be sure since the type of &quot;supersociety&quot; in question does not
<br>
exist for us to study.  But even if we can't be sure it's impossible is there ANY evidence that it could exist AT ALL much less that
<br>
it would somehow prove superior to us?
