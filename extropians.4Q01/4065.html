</em><br>
<p>Have any less common keywords that might turn up information about
<br>
the above?
<br>
<p>The Na, a tribe in Yunnan (southern province famous for spring-like
<br>
weather and numerous minorities) that has no marriage or anything
<br>
similar.  Sex happens in the context of a furtive (but agreed upon
<br>
in advance) &quot;visit&quot;, in which a man meets a woman in her bedroom
<br>
after dusk and leaves before dawn.  Children are rasied by the
<br>
mother's extended family, and nobody knows who their fathers are.
<br>
Na society isn't less rigid the average human society with something
<br>
like marriage, just in different ways.  For example, sex can't be
<br>
spoken of at all in public, because you don't know who your sibilings
<br>
are, and there is a strong incest taboo.  The biggest problem in
<br>
Na society (apart from centuries of failed attempts to get them to
<br>
adopt a &quot;normal&quot; lifestyle by Han Chinese) is that half of Na adults
<br>
have syphilis.
<br>
<p>Or so I gathered from reading a review of &quot;A Society Without Fathers
<br>
or Husbands: The Na of China&quot; by Cai Hua translated from French by
<br>
Asti Hustvedt in <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/contents/20011018">http://www.nybooks.com/contents/20011018</a> (unfortunately
<br>
that article isn't online).  The reviewer makes a big deal about
<br>
the Na falsifying one or two dominant theories held by sociologists,
<br>
but I can't remember any details, perhaps something about the
<br>
universality of the nuclear family?

<p>I'd almost certainly have been more promiscuous in such a world.
<br>
Aversion to taking on long term risks for short term benefits seems
<br>
to be deeply rooted in my disposition.  I hear that some &quot;at risk&quot;
<br>
people actually get a thrill out of the possibility of contracting
<br>
STDs.  Perhaps they'd be less promiscuous in an STD-free world.
