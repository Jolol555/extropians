This is where the words begin to fail me. I'll have a go at it, anyway.
<br>
<p>Consciousness is. It's the only thing that I can experience directly;
<br>
everything else is indirect. Here I mean consciousness as distinct from
<br>
attention/cognition/etc. It's that bit of the me which seems both to have
<br>
absolutely no function (by definition, perhaps **), and yet paradoxically is
<br>
the most important part of all.
<br>
<p>There may be some of you who don't know what I'm talking about. Sorry, but
<br>
you are a zombie. My condolences.
<br>
<p>As to the rest of us...
<br>
<p>Consciousness is often defined as this intangible thing, strapped onto
<br>
otherwise material beings for who knows what reason. It must be noted that
<br>
if it were truly intangible, I wouldn't be able to experience it or write
<br>
about it. It is affecting my actions in a tangible way. This seems to pull
<br>
it back into the world of stuff, a slippery slope. It's part of the material
<br>
universe, because it interacts with it in a measurable way.
<br>
<p>Consciousness is. But computers only describe; simulations describe. Even
<br>
the calculations in the execution of an algorithm don't seem to escape from
<br>
the world of information into the world of &quot;stuff&quot;, except in that electrons
<br>
really do run around circuits in interesting patterns which have some
<br>
isomorphism onto the algorithm.
<br>
<p>Or try this... A computer can describe/simulate an atom (theoretically). It
<br>
can't, however, create it. The act of description/simulation does not create
<br>
those things described/simulated, but only a representation of them.
<br>
<p>We may find that conscious beings can be adequately described &amp; simulated in
<br>
a computer, that we can make a model that behaves exactly as a conscious
<br>
being would. This in no way creates the subjective experience of
<br>
consciousness anywhere.
<br>
<p>However, this doesn't mean that a &quot;machine&quot; cannot be made which could in
<br>
fact include that subjective experience of consciousness. Consciousness is
<br>
tangible (to the self involved), thus it must be part of the physical
<br>
universe. That we can simulate an atom using information processing without
<br>
being able to directly manipulate one does not mean that we cannot directly
<br>
manipulate one at all - we can build I/O devices for the job. Similarly,
<br>
that we cannot construct consciousness purely by processing information,
<br>
does not imply that it cannot be done, just that we need something else than
<br>
a turing machine. Just as a Turing machine cannot make text appear on paper,
<br>
but a printer can.
<br>
<p>So what I'm saying I guess is that the world of information processing (call
<br>
it I? Maybe I want N or some other such beast from computability), is either
<br>
distinct from or else a strict subset of the physical world (P?). There are
<br>
things that information processing cannot do, which the material world can
<br>
do, and that it the direct manipulation of the material world.

&gt; &gt; I always find this metaphor unsatisfying. Particularly 
&gt; because, even though
&gt; &gt; I might believe that we could create conscious intelligence 
&gt; from parts,
&gt; &gt; those parts might not be in the form of a von-neumann 
&gt; computer. It may be
&gt; &gt; the case that there are some quite stringent restrictions 
&gt; on the substrate
&gt; &gt; for intelligence+consciousness, including 
&gt; stopping/restarting, wholesale
&gt; &gt; copying around in memory (or whatever persistence mechanism 
&gt; was to be used),
&gt; &gt; etc. There might be restrictions which entirely preclude running
&gt; &gt; consciousness on a suped-up Pentium.
&gt; 
&gt; It's a general principle of computer science that all computers are
&gt; equivalent in their expressive power.  What one computer can 
&gt; do, another
&gt; computer can simulate.
&gt; 
&gt; If it turned out that certain kinds of computers couldn't run 
&gt; conscious
&gt; programs but others could, that would invalidate this thesis. 
&gt;  It would
&gt; mean that there were physical systems which could not be simulated by
&gt; conventional computers, that there is fundamentally more to 
&gt; the universe
&gt; than can be expressed by algorithmic modelling.
&gt; 
&gt; It's always possible that this may turn out to be true, but 
&gt; so far there
&gt; is no evidence of it.  Even quantum systems can be simulated to any
&gt; desired degree of precision.  And as far as we know the brain uses no
&gt; &quot;magic physics,&quot; which this result would require.
&gt; 
&gt; So if it does turn out that consciousness is non-physical or cannot be
&gt; simulated by a computer, that will be contrary to all of our 
&gt; experience
&gt; and scientific understanding of the world.  It will certainly be a
&gt; surprising result.
