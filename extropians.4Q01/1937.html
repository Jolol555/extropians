</em><br>
<p>Do you think that the attacks occurred primarily because we
<br>
were &quot;increasing our own morality (or freedom)..&quot;?  I don't see
<br>
how this conclusion is at all obvious. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; History clearly shows how we have botched the job (forgetting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Afghanistan as soon as the Soviets pulled out and focusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead on Iraq).  So I'm pessimistic that *anything* we do now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will turn out well.  However living in a democratic society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have to realize the fate of politicians who argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we should take the hit on withdrawal from our oil addiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its political suicide.  The bottom line is that one can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;manage&quot; the disaster as best you can and hope technology will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dig us out of our hole before it all goes to hell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I would humbly suggest that business as usual of simply managing
<br>
the problem will not necessarily work now and is increasingly
<br>
less likely to work as the world gets more complex while
<br>
shrinking in the speed at which effects propagate.  It is time
<br>
to take some hits imho in order to do things a bit differently.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Does anyone seriously think it will not abuse these new powers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, a better question is, will such abuses extend the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longevity of the average law-abiding citizen?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That may not be the best question to ask since no true
<br>
extropians are &quot;average law-abiding citizen&quot; types.  Two out of
<br>
three perhaps. A better question is to what extent such abuses
<br>
are likely to make transcendence of this mess through extropian
<br>
means even more difficult than the relatively small probability
<br>
of being offed by some terrorist.   Given that the extended
<br>
powers make the governments knowledge of what we all do and its
<br>
ability to do something about it without as much judicial
<br>
oversight and review, I find it quite likely that some of what
<br>
at least some of us belief is utterly necessary for getting to
<br>
Singularity in one piece will be ruled illegal and vigourously
<br>
suppressed and now, much more effectively, suppressed.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We are holding ~1000 people now on various minor charges associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the WTC attacks.  Most of those people, I would believe, are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens (or perhaps recent citizens, perhaps here under false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretenses).  At least some of those individuals are taking the 5th
</em><br>
<p>Some of them are plan citizens.  Many of them say they know
<br>
nothing. Many refuse to give in to such (as they and I see it)
<br>
bullying by government officials.  That is their right.  The day
<br>
it isn't we all should worry a lot more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and refusing to talk.  While I'm not an expert on any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible side effects of drugs inducing individuals to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more cooperative, it seems likely that they are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damaging than the torture that arrested suspects endure in most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries.  I am not opposed to the use of will-diminishing
</em><br>
<p>I am very saddened to see you take such a line.  Is your
<br>
paranoia so great, your fear so high, that you would resort to
<br>
the use of force on the minds of mere suspects many of which
<br>
have no charges of any real significance filed against them?  Do
<br>
your really think it is justifiable to do such a thing in
<br>
defiance of international laws over so relatively little?  If
<br>
so, then what methods do you think should be used against folks
<br>
such as Eliezer who might just be designing something that takes
<br>
over control (however benignly) of the entire local space-time? 
<br>
I would think many, many people would be a great deal more
<br>
fearful of such than of terrorism.  If only fear counts and the
<br>
avoidance of danger, then what will keep the Eliezers of this
<br>
world safe?  
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; non-violent methods in cases where there is reasonable evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that such individuals intend to use their resources or knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to conduct &quot;acts&quot; of war (i.e. where they may be willing to sacrifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves to kill or harm a large number of non-involved parties).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Knowledge that such methods might be used would prompt terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to provide their agents with suicide pills in the event the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show up at their door.  From my perspective allowing them to exit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage left of their own free will could be the best solution for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are many, many things that many of us seriously consider
<br>
doing that have huge potential to seriously effect and even
<br>
kill-off many non-involved parties.  Should we reexamine our
<br>
thinking on these things?  Are we someone else's &quot;terrorist&quot;?  
<br>

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bottom line -- dead people don't care about their privacy *or*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their freedom.
</em><br>
<p>But we are alive and we must care not just about continuing to
<br>
be alive but what type of lives we live and inflict on others. 
<br>
Else, what the hell is the point of living forever?
