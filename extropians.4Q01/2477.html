<p>
Mr. Nichols,
<br>
<p>I like your idea of a transhuman political project, and have just written an
<br>
essay about &quot;The Politics of Transhumanism&quot; that you may be interested in:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm">http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm</a>
<br>
<p>In fact, I welcome comments from the extrops in general as I'm preparing the
<br>
article for submission for publication.
<br>
<p>However, point 1 in your four-point platform below is a little ambiguous,
<br>
perhaps intentionally so:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (1) Social liberalism/ libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) Support for new scientific research and accelerated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological programs (nanotech, nets, genetics, cryonics &amp;c.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (3) Acceleration of programs for space colonisation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (4) Psychological &quot;reform&quot; ... particularly opposition to human-era
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions &amp; supernaturalism .... and other regressive forces.
</em><br>
<p>The two principal ideological axes on which Western politics have situated
<br>
themselves have been cultural liberalism-conservatism and economic
<br>
liberalism-conservatism.  I believe almost all transhumanists would be
<br>
cultural liberals since they generally reject religion, nationalism,
<br>
racialism, and support gay rights, abortion access, and women's equality. I
<br>
discuss in my essay the new phenomenon of self-styled &quot;fascist
<br>
transhumanism&quot; but I think that's a pretty rough row to hoe.
<br>
<p>However, there is no intrinsic political economy in transhumanism, or your
<br>
points 2-3 above. One could support science and space through
<br>
government-financed R&amp;D, market-based R&amp;D, or a mixture of the two. One
<br>
might support market-based R&amp;D, but support an egalitarian welfare state,
<br>
national health care and strong public health and safety regulations. The
<br>
extropians may be primarily libertarian economically, but it is likely that
<br>
you will find a larger audience for your ideas with a broader and more
<br>
pragmatic set of economic policies. Positioning yourself in economic policy
<br>
would be important for clarity, even if you intentionally say &quot;I'm for
<br>
whatever gets us there, from state financing to market forces.&quot;
<br>
<p>Secondly, have you explored what sort of opportunities exist within existing
<br>
parties? Labour has been the most aggressive supporter of science and
<br>
technology, increasing the science and NHS budgets, after a decade of Tory
<br>
starvation, strongly supporting scientists against animal rights terrorism,
<br>
and adopting more progressive policies on cloning and stem cells than we are
<br>
likely to see in the U.S. for a while. Labour is a large and fractious
<br>
beast, and there must be a faction or interest group that has an agenda
<br>
close to transhumanism's concerns - a space or biotech interest group. You
<br>
could learn a lot by joining a party and campaigning for a candidate that
<br>
was closest to your views for an election cycle before trying to launch your
<br>
own party.
<br>
<p>You might also find some inspiration in Ken MacLeod's idea of a UK &quot;Space
<br>
and Freedom Party&quot; in _The Star Fraction_.
