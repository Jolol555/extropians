<p>The conjecture as I automatically rephrased it - that people can alter the
<br>
outcome of arbitrarily selected events by wishing - undermines the whole
<br>
of science, if true.  But the conjecture is not self-undermining.  Whether
<br>
the outcome of the experiment was influenced by the researchers wishes, or
<br>
the individual patients were influenced by the prayers, the experiment (if
<br>
reproduced, which I predict it won't be) definitely and unambiguously
<br>
indicates that Something Darned Funny Is Going On, which is all one can
<br>
really ask of such an experiment.
