</em><br>
<p>But that's what we're arguing about, I would maintain that getting copied in a
<br>
destructive manner and then being rebuilt would not destroy &quot;you&quot; either.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;2) and the mechanism that houses  your consciousness never changes.
</em><br>
<p>That is certainly untrue, getting hit in the head so hard you black out must
<br>
make big (temporarily it is to be wished) changes  in your brain.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;Living through a session of complete neural cessation also does not involve
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;the changing of the physical mechanism housing the consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Not so, expect huge chemical changes, probably physical ones too.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I can be reasonable sure that when I go to sleep at night I don't die for a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; few reasons 1) Hooking me up to any kind of machine that measures brain
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; activity would never measure any absolute cessation in activity
</em><br>
<p>Not in normal sleep but it would under deep anesthesia. When you go to the
<br>
hospital to have your tonsils removed are you the same man when you walk out?
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;The molecules and atoms that make up my mind and  house my
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;consciousness are never observed to change form or shape during the
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;course of the evening.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand this obsession with atoms, there are no scratches on a
<br>
hydrogen atom to tell one from another, they are far from unique, if they
<br>
can't even give this interesting property to themselves they can't confer
<br>
it to us.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I can also be reasonably sure that I was not murdered last night
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you can be reasonably sure you were not murdered last night,
<br>
of course you can't be absolutely sure of anything. I think.
<br>
Anyway a more interesting question is if you were murdered last night
<br>
and replaced by a &quot;copy&quot; is there any rational reason to be upset about
<br>
it this morning? I can't think of any.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;As I pointed out in my original response to this, replacing one atom at a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;time is far different from replacing all atoms at once. [...]  The RATE of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;the replacement is the key difference.
</em><br>
<p>So there must be a fastest permissible rate, if the copy is made 50% too fast
<br>
does it make it 50% you? Or perhaps it works like a switch and if the copy is made
<br>
.00000001% too fast it's not you at all. And then there is the problem that Einstein
<br>
tells us that there is no one true objective rate of change, it depends on the
<br>
observer. Perhaps you could say it's you if at any one time you don't change
<br>
much, but if I make the &quot;any one time&quot; a nanosecond and then blow you up with
<br>
dynamite you won't change much.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;if a copy is made with a passive scanning system and we are both revived,
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;do we perceive the same thing?
</em><br>
<p>You could be perceiving the same thing, it depends on how the experiment is set up.
<br>
If you are not seeing the same thing then the memories of the two of you will be
<br>
different and you will no longer be copies. You'll each go your separate ways.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;should I be destroyed, copied, then resurrected, the instances could indeed
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;be observed.  The destroying, the massive room sized scanner moving and
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;spinning around my head, and the room sized molecular construction system
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;creating a copy of me.
</em><br>
<p>It's funny you should say that, a few years ago that very thing happened to me.
<br>
Here is what I wrote to the list back in 1996 asking how I should proceed.
<br>
===
<br>
<p>I need some advice and it's not the sort of thing I can write to
<br>
Ann Landers. About a year ago I started building a matter
<br>
duplicating machine. It could find the position and velocity of
<br>
every atom in a human being to the limit imposed by Heisenberg's law.
<br>
It then used this information to construct a copy and it does it all
<br>
in a fraction of a second and without harming the original in any way.
<br>
You may be surprised that I was able to build such a complicated machine,
<br>
but you wouldn't be if you knew how good  I am with my hands. The birdhouse
<br>
I made is simply lovely and I have all  the latest tools from Sears.
<br>
<p>I was a little nervous but I decided to test the machine by
<br>
duplicating myself. The day before yesterday I walked into the
<br>
chamber, it filled with smoke (damn those radio shack
<br>
transformers) there was a flash of light, and then 3 feet to my
<br>
left was a man who looked exactly like me. It  was at that
<br>
instant that the full realization of the terrible thing I did
<br>
hit  me. I yelled &quot; This is monstrous, there can only be one of me&quot;,
<br>
my copy yelled exactly the same thing. I thought he was
<br>
trying to mock me, so I reached for my 44 magnum that I always
<br>
carry with me (I wonder why people think I'm strange) and
<br>
pointed it at my double. I noted with alarm that the double also
<br>
had a gun and he was pointed it at me. I shouted &quot;you don't have
<br>
the guts to pull the trigger, but I do&quot;. Again he mimicked my
<br>
words and did so in perfect synchronization, this made me even
<br>
more angry and I pulled the trigger, he did too. My gun went off
<br>
but his gun jammed. I buried him in my back yard.
<br>
<p>Now that my anger has cooled and I can think more clearly I've
<br>
had some pangs of conscious about killing a living creature,
<br>
but that's not what really torments me. How do I know I'm  not
<br>
the copy? I feel exactly the same as before, but would a copy
<br>
feel different? Actually there is a  way to be certain, I have a
<br>
video tape of the entire experiment. My memory is  that the copy
<br>
first appeared 3 feet to my LEFT, if the tape shows the original
<br>
walking into the chamber and the copy materializing 3 feet to
<br>
his RIGHT, then I would know that I am the copy.
<br>
<p>I'm afraid to look at the tape, should I  be? If I found out I
<br>
was the copy  what should I do? I suppose I should morn the
<br>
death of John Clark, but how can I, I'm not dead. If I am the
<br>
copy would that mean that I have no real  past and my life is
<br>
meaningless? Is it important, or should I just burn the tape
<br>
and forget all about it?
