Smell rules fire ants
<br>

<br>
One gene controls whether a persistent pest serves one or many queens.
<br>
16 November 2001
<br>
JOHN WHITFIELD
<br>
<p>A protein that spots smell controls the power structure of fire ant colonies,
<br>
Michael Krieger and Kenneth Ross of the University of Georgia, Athens, have
<br>
discovered (1). One form of the protein leads to nests with several queens
<br>
living in harmony. The other leaves only one ruler.
<br>
<p>Fire ants' social life is of more than academic interest. The species
<br>
(Solenopsis invicta) has spread from its South American homeland to become a
<br>
serious pest in the Southern United States.
<br>
<p>The ants drive out native insects and inflict painful bites on humans and
<br>
livestock, doing damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
<br>
Earlier this year fire ants appeared in Australia.
<br>
<p>Multiple-queen colonies are a particular menace: nests can reach ten times the
<br>
density of single-queen colonies in a given area.
<br>
<p>Worker ants in multi-monarch colonies execute queens bearing the wrong genetic
<br>
badge. Tapping into the signals that control this - with synthetic scents, for
<br>
example - might allow us to trigger self-destructive infighting among the
<br>
ants, speculates Laurent Keller, an evolutionary biologist at the University
<br>
of Lausanne, Switzerland.
<br>
<p>&quot;Interfering with the process by which fire ants regulate queen number could
<br>
wreak havoc in colonies,&quot; agrees Gene Robinson, who studies honey-bee genetics
<br>
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
<br>
<p>Causing a stink
<br>
Krieger and Ross have identified Gp-9, the gene that encodes the
<br>
odour-detecting protein. Each ant has two copies of Gp-9, which can take one
<br>
of two forms, known as B and b. Nests of BB ants contain one queen, those of
<br>
Bb ants several; the bb form is lethal. Workers with Bb genes kill BB queens
<br>
and workers in BB nests execute all queens except their sole ruler.
<br>
<p>The identification of the protein is &quot;a very important finding&quot;, says Keller.
<br>
&quot;We knew that a single gene was responsible for the two social forms, but we
<br>
didn't know if the protein that Gp-9 makes was important. This shows that it
<br>
really does underlie the two forms - and it's exactly the type of gene that
<br>
you'd predict it to be.&quot;
<br>
<p>Gp-9 controls queen number in three other ant species closely related to fire
<br>
ants, Krieger and Ross have also found. This suggests that the genetic control
<br>
originated several million years ago, and has persisted as a single ancestral
<br>
species evolved and split into several. Krieger suspects that Gp-9 may be at
<br>
work in many more species.
<br>
<p>The leaders of multi-queen nests are less regal than queens that rule alone.
<br>
They are smaller, and cannot establish new colonies unaided. Krieger thinks
<br>
that workers tolerate the diminutive despots because they do not recognize
<br>
them as royals.
