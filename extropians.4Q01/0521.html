A Bose-Einstein condensate, a group of atoms that have the same
<br>
quantum wavefunction, was first made 6 years ago, it took a room full of
<br>
expensive equipment. In the current issue of Nature Ron Folman and
<br>
Jorg Schmidmayer report they can form a BEC on a microchip in less
<br>
than a second, and they can move it around the chip. In a editorial the
<br>
editors of Nature write:
<br>
<p>&quot;What next? The atom chip might lead to miniaturized versions of highly
<br>
accurate atomic clocks and acceleration sensors, which are already
<br>
used for precision measurements. Such tiny systems could be useful in
<br>
navigation systems. The atom chip could also be integrated into quantum
<br>
communication and encryption systems, which ensure information security.
<br>
In quantum information, a 'qubit' is the quantum equivalent of a classical 'bit'
<br>
of information. So, for example, the atom chip may enable the conversion
<br>
of 'flying qubits' (photons that can travel along optical fibres) into
<br>
'storage qubits' — atoms that can be kept in a single location for a long
<br>
time without changing their quantum state. A final example, and the most
<br>
far-reaching, is the quantum computer, for which quantum theory predicts
<br>
a new type of computing logic, able in some cases to outrun the present
<br>
classical computers by many orders of magnitude in processing time.
<br>
Once further advances are made on issues such as single-atom trapping
<br>
and controlled entanglement, which are needed to do computations, the atom
<br>
chip could turn out to be the obvious choice for building a quantum computer.&quot;
