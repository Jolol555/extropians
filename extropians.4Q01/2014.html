</em><br>
<p>Actually, outside investors invest in mechanisms/systems that increase
<br>
the productivity/reproductivity of that which is created. Their return
<br>
on their capital is based on the 'added value'.
<br>
<p>While multiple creators working in a team may apportion their credit to
<br>
each other as they see fit, you don't create anything original by simply
<br>
plonking down a wad of cash. While a corporation may own the rights to
<br>
reproduce as licensed to it by a works creator(s), it, even today,
<br>
cannot be listed as the 'artist' or 'inventor' on a patent or copyright
<br>
registration. The problem is that artists are not protected sufficiently
<br>
from those who claim to be the artists greatest benefactors. In the
<br>
music arena, you have the record companies, for example, who generally
<br>
treat most of their artists like crap, and use all sorts of accounting
<br>
tricks to evade royalty payments. Those companies then go on the warpath
<br>
to 'protect' their artists rights from pirates, when there would be no
<br>
piracy if the companies had fulfilled their responsibility to the
<br>
artists to technologically secure their works.
<br>
<p>However, no work can be fully protected if it is to be fully enjoyed by
<br>
the public. Hi definition releases make piracy assured of occuring, in a
<br>
low trust environment. So, in the end, we are reduced once more to the
<br>
problem of high trust vs low trust. IP laws work in a high trust
<br>
environment, but not in a low trust one. Unrestricted immigration has
<br>
diluted the formerly high trust milieu of the US market, and expansion
<br>
into other low trust markets has likewise fed additional piracy.
<br>
<p>So we are left to deal with why piracy occurs. Outside of skinflints who
<br>
don't want to pay for something, and spoiled brats who think that
<br>
everything should be free, you have a core audience of the economically
<br>
disadvantaged that the first two groups piggyback on. Perhaps with the
<br>
expansion of micropayment schemes, there could also be instituted a sort
<br>
of micro-financial aid, where those on public assistance and those in
<br>
school would get a hefty discount or even waived fees in electronic
<br>
music distribution. Instituting such a program would eliminate much of
<br>
the piracy propaganda, while at the same time attaching a stigma to
<br>
getting 'free music', which would imply that you are on an economic low
<br>
rung, something that peer pressure concious youths try very hard to
<br>
avoid.
