</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha is the epitome of the dogmatic relativist.
</em><br>
<p>What you are the epitome of is quite obvious so I won't even
<br>
sink to naming it.  I gave no such dogmatic belief as you
<br>
claim.  A cleaner reading is not that bin Laden and parties want
<br>
to kill all of us but they want certain policies to end and
<br>
consider targetting us legitimate until they do.  That is still
<br>
an atrocious position to be sure but it is not as simplistic as
<br>
your wording.  Understanding other societies or calls to is not
<br>
being a relativist, it is being a realist and having a healthy
<br>
respect for others different choices. Relativism would be
<br>
claiming all positions were equally of merit regardless of their
<br>
nature because there is no objective morality. Objective
<br>
morality is not served by effectively taking a position of &quot;my
<br>
country right or wrong&quot;.  What we most need to understand is
<br>
that we have been flaming buttholes ourselves in several areas
<br>
and that some of the level of terrorism is a result of our own
<br>
policies and actions and cannot be resolved without
<br>
understanding this and changing some of those policies and
<br>
attempting to fix some of the messes we have caused.  A MidEast
<br>
full of armed highly trained fanatic fundamentalists is one of
<br>
our messes.  
<br>
<p>Islam is a religion of peace in part like most of the world's
<br>
major religions.  There is nothing relativist in the slightest
<br>
about pointing this out.  Nor is there anything relativist in
<br>
pointing out that casting this as a war against Islam is likely
<br>
to produce hideous consequences determinal in the extreme to all
<br>
of our hopes and dreams.  A near monopoly on terrorism heh?  Do
<br>
you really believe that the US and Israel and many other
<br>
countries and peoples have never resorted to what can
<br>
legitimately be called &quot;terrorism&quot;.  Let's not be absurd here.
<br>
<p><p>Mike, get it right or make yourself the laughing stock of the
<br>
list.
