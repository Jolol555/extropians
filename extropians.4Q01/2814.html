</em><br>
<p>I seem to recall a time when we were saying the same thing to Europe. We
<br>
had fought a massive, industrialized war on our own soil a mere 50 years
<br>
prior and were in no mood to sustain similar losses. We pretended that
<br>
we were more 'civilized' in our pacifism, that we were &quot;Too proud to
<br>
fight&quot; (Woodrow Wilson), and that the belligerent nations were
<br>
destroying the world in their incessant waste of natural resources to
<br>
feed their seemingly permanent war economies. Many here in the US
<br>
claimed that both sides were morally equivalent (i.e. not very) in their
<br>
abhorrence of human dignity, and that the British Empire had 'asked for
<br>
it' by its centuries long domination of other nations and the world's
<br>
oceans. Those that claimed the Austro-Hungarian empire and its German
<br>
allies were despotic regiemes that ruled their serfs with fear and
<br>
terror were called 'unsophisticated' and unable to appreciate the
<br>
history and culture of central europe....  anything here starting to
<br>
sound familiar?
