<p>This is the most concise, non-technical, non-legalese summation of the
<br>
information-wants-to-be-free side of the great debate that I've found
<br>
so far. As far as getting the point across simply and concisely, this
<br>
guy is right up there with Eric S. Raymond.
<br>
<p>This essay was stolen from:

<p>Steal This Essay 1: Content Is a Pure Public Good
<br>
by Dan Kohn
<br>
<p>Steal this essay, or, why these sorts of essays represent the future
<br>
of all publishing. Hint: I'm not getting paid for them.
<br>
<p>&quot;Freedom of the press belongs to those who own one.&quot; - A.J. Liebling
<br>
If you or anyone you know has ever or will ever produce content
<br>
(writing, music, video, etc.) and hopes to get paid for it, you should
<br>
be afraid.
<br>
<p>To see why, start by downloading (for free, of course) one of the
<br>
numerous peer-to-peer file sharing systems such as Aimster, LimeWire,
<br>
and eDonkey2000 that have emerged hydra-like to take the place of
<br>
Napster, whose head was cut off this spring by the Recording Industry
<br>
Association of America (RIAA). You will find that much the same
<br>
selection of MP3 music that was on Napster is still available for
<br>
free, as well as being accompanied by more and more movies (&quot;ripped&quot;
<br>
directly from DVDs), and nearly all other forms of content, from
<br>
Shakespeare's works to hard core adult materials.
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.aimster.com/">http://www.aimster.com/</a>&gt;
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.limewire.com/">http://www.limewire.com/</a>&gt;
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.edonkey2000.com/">http://www.edonkey2000.com/</a>&gt;
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.napster.com/">http://www.napster.com/</a>&gt;
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbser=1206">http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbser=1206</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>What you will not find - even if you are the RIAA - is anyone to
<br>
sue. Because unlike Napster, there are no companies underlying the
<br>
software infrastructure, no servers to confiscate, no officers on whom
<br>
to serve papers. The next generation of peer-to-peer clients relies on
<br>
no central infrastructure whatsoever, and is being developed by a
<br>
loose knit group of developers spread around the world, all donating
<br>
their significant efforts without any real hope of getting paid for
<br>
their work. All of the developers are men - or teenage boys - and
<br>
though not following the typical societal track toward prestige, they
<br>
are just as competitive as any rival athletes or entrepreneurs. Many
<br>
are distributing their software as open source, so anyone else can fix
<br>
bugs and make improvements. What this means is not just that the RIAA
<br>
is applying makeup to the corpse of the music industry as we've known
<br>
it. In fact, it heralds an even larger change about how all content is
<br>
created and distributed, and raises serious questions as to whether
<br>
content creators (such as the author of this essay) will ever be
<br>
compensated for our work.
<br>
<p>Read a few dozen articles by top technology analysts, and it is often
<br>
difficult to find one that doesn't breathlessly declare how this or
<br>
that new technology represents a sea change, an inflection point, or
<br>
the end of history. In fact, while the Internet's growth rates have
<br>
been quite high, other technologies such as radio and gas cooking have
<br>
actually been adopted faster. It may be, though, that all of the hype
<br>
surrounding the digital duplication and peer-to-peer distribution of
<br>
content actually underestimates the impact on the authors and
<br>
publishers of music, movies, and written works.
<br>
<p>Put simply, in a world where there are essentially no costs to
<br>
replicate content and it is effectively impossible to stop anyone from
<br>
doing so at will, the current economic model underpinning content
<br>
creation will be dead. Despite the protestations of lawyers, (certain)
<br>
rock bands, and legislatures (all on the same losing side, oddly
<br>
enough), we are entering that brave new world.
<br>
<p>If, as this hard technology determinist viewpoint suggests, content is
<br>
destined to be free - i.e., the content creators and publishers will
<br>
not be directly compensated the way they are today when you make a
<br>
purchase from your local CD store - then the real question is what
<br>
system could replace the content compensation system that has worked
<br>
quite well for the last 300 years. However, implementing revenue
<br>
models for infinitely redistributable goods is not an entirely novel
<br>
question, and there are several economic models that can support the
<br>
creation of content. What there may not be is enough revenue to
<br>
support the publishers of that content in addition to the authors,
<br>
which helps explain why the RIAA is so eager to thwart digital
<br>
distribution. When an ecosystem undergoes severe environmental
<br>
changes, certain organisms that were previously essential - like the
<br>
cyanobacteria that originally converted carbon dioxide to oxygen, or
<br>
the record companies' A&amp;R men - may recede to minor ecological niches.
<br>
<p>Economists have a term for what digital goods have become. Items are
<br>
&quot;nonrival&quot; when we can all make use of them without anyone having to
<br>
give them up. If I copy your CD, you're none the worse for it
<br>
(nonrival), but if I steal your car, you will probably be upset
<br>
(rival). Goods are &quot;nonexcludable&quot; when it becomes impractical to stop
<br>
everyone from making use of the item, once one person can. It is
<br>
infeasible, for instance, to stop additional viewers of broadcast
<br>
television (nonexcludable), while it is very feasible to stop
<br>
additional moviegoers from entering a theater (excludable). Economists
<br>
call nonrival, nonexcludable items &quot;pure public goods,&quot; although the
<br>
name does not imply that public goods can be provided only by the
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>Lighthouses are a classic pure public good. They are nonrival because
<br>
each additional ship does not reduce the light available to the
<br>
others. They are nonexcludable because any ship sailing by can see
<br>
them. There are cases in New England two centuries ago of shipping
<br>
guilds building privately managed lighthouses, even though the
<br>
services couldn't be withheld from non-members. Most medical research
<br>
and nearly all basic scientific research today is a pure public good,
<br>
although for exactly this reason it is often financed (at least
<br>
indirectly) by the government. Other textbook public goods are
<br>
national defense, mosquito control, and public radio. In each case,
<br>
the cost of providing the item to one consumer is the same as
<br>
providing it to any number of consumers (nonrival), and it is
<br>
impractical to stop anyone from making use of the good
<br>
(nonexcludable). The table below provides some examples.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  EXCLUDABLE        |  NONEXCLUDABLE
<br>
&nbsp;-----------+--------------------+--------------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;RIVAL      |  car, Walkman      |  unmanaged fishing rights
<br>
&nbsp;-----------+--------------------+--------------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;NONRIVAL   |  movie in a movie  |  lighthouses, national defense,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  theater, concert  |  mosquito control
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  in a large hall   |
<br>
<p>If content is becoming a pure public good, it will necessitate a
<br>
radical rethinking of the recording industry's claim that copying
<br>
content is stealing. We as a society react very differently toward the
<br>
unpaid use of rival versus nonrival goods. Think of the punishment
<br>
inflicted, for example, on those who steal cars versus those who
<br>
listen to public radio without contributing to the fund drives. Of
<br>
course, whether a good is rival or not is beside the point if you can
<br>
successfully exclude people who don't pay. (Ask Microsoft, whose cost
<br>
for selling one copy of Office is approximately the same as selling
<br>
100 million copies (nonrival), but which has used informant tactics
<br>
and large legal penalties to make their software very excludable, at
<br>
least for businesses.)
<br>
<p>The lawyers representing the recording and movie industry are well
<br>
aware of the threat to their business models of digital content, and
<br>
they believe they have already developed the answer:
<br>
encryption. Encryption represents the music industry's last, best hope
<br>
of maintaining their product as excludable. Why they are wrong, and
<br>
content protection is doomed to failure, will have to wait for the
<br>
next essay.
