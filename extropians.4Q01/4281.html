<p>
So I was talking to one of my clients today after a long discussion of her
<br>
product-to-be (another obvious-in-hindsight thing that should make a fair
<br>
amount of money...there's a lot of startups under the rocks again; next
<br>
quarter will be interesting, but I digress) on matters of life, philosophy
<br>
and death. She's a very smart 40something, married to a geologist, she's an
<br>
objectivist, atheist libertarian who's read enough and thought enough about
<br>
her own existence to intelligently talk about identity vrs continuity of
<br>
being. She doesn't want to die, and thinks about it a lot.
<br>
<p>But she'd never heard of transhumanism. Much less extropianism.
<br>
<p>Now I'm a fairly straightforward kinda person; all I want to is to live
<br>
forever in a continuity sort of way. If that means clump of nanoware-packed
<br>
asteroids in the outer solar system, then that means clump of
<br>
nanoware-packed asteroids in the outer solar system, but it's means rather
<br>
than an end. So it bothers me that there are people out there in the
<br>
immortality marketplace -- potential philosophical customers, as it were,
<br>
who are not being addressed.
<br>
<p>This sort of sampling doesn't bode well for my chances to live forever in a
<br>
continuity sort of way. It needs to change.
<br>
<p>So what can ExI do for me? Educate the masses. Move beyond the
<br>
philosophical-intellectual circles; I think you have your missive and your
<br>
mission down pat. It's good. A bit broad for my taste, but as has been
<br>
noted, I'm a little obsessive about the immortality thing. But more people
<br>
need to be drawn in, which means coming up with broader ways to spread the
<br>
meme. If spreading the net more widely gets the progress you want, then you
<br>
have to change the net and change the way you spread it to do so...
<br>
<p>So I see nothing wrong with raising money explicity to put ExI thoughtlines
<br>
in the sides of buses. Or in local newspapers. Or anywhere else that strikes
<br>
our fancy. Transhumanism, extropianism and associated life extension memes
<br>
need to become ideas that have an entry in the encyclopedia.

<em>&gt; Subject: EXI: What can we do for you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Importance: High
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PLEASE GIVE US YOUR FEEDBACK
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A number of extropians have come together to pursue an unprecedented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reworking and rejuvenation of Extropy Institute. We are improving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizational structure, improving processes to encourage progress in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numerous projects, and opening up to wider involvement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This message and survey is an attempt to serve you, fellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better. Our community would benefit from a more vigorous, resource-rich,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and active Extropy Institute. We would like to know what prevents many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you from getting involved. &quot;Involved&quot; can mean becoming a member and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing financially to the survival and growth of ExI, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talent and energy to furthering one of ExI's projects. (Many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listed in the issue of Exponent that went out last Sunday.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are already a member or if you already contribute financially or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with skills, please take the questions as asking what would spur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Q U E S T I O N S:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- If you have not become a full member of Extropy Institute or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in some other significant way, what would spur you to want to do this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Does Extropy Institute do anything that discourages you from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joining and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- What does Extropy Institute not do, to your knowledge, that you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be valuable to the extropian transhumanist community and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; induce you to join and contribute?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- What does Extropy Institute do that you find worthwhile, but which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think could be done much better? (Bonus question: Do you have ideas about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *how* it could be done better?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- If you really *do* want to join or contribute in some way, but haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotten around to it, what is holding you back?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please send your responses to me at &lt;<a href="mailto:max@maxmore.com?Subject=RE:%20What%20can%20we%20do%20for%20you?&In-Reply-To=&lt;EPEELOAJBJFJPKFALCGKCENCCMAA.reason@exratio.com&gt;">max@maxmore.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will share the results with the Extropians list (without names, unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you ask that your name be mentioned with your views) if or when enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responses are in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Be direct, bold, and hold nothing back. The goal is to elicit productive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback so we can continue to improve Extropy Institute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (If anyone has critical comments that are specifically about me and would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather I not get them, please send them to E. Shaun and he will pass them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on minus the names. I will not ask!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a vital time for ExI to function as a healthy, vigorous, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influential organization. The rate of technological change continues to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerate. The forces of conservatism, resistance and regulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing. Issues requiring carefully thought out transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responses, dealing with potential problems and resistance are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrusting their way into public discussion. We need you! Tell us how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Onward!
