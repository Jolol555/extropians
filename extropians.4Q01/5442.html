Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>Robert Ettinger, one of the &quot;fathers&quot; of cryonics, wrote this perceptive post on how a cryonicist can win over their mate on the matter of actually being put into biostasis.  I think it would be very worthwhile reading for some of the people here.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John

Subject: wives etc.
<br>
<p>A few more words about reluctant spouses--mainly wives--of members of 
<br>
cryonics organizations.
<br>
<p>First, any mixed marriage--Republican and Democrat, Protestant and Catholic, 
<br>
whatever--has extra hurdles to clear. Nevertheless, there are a great many 
<br>
mixed marriages, and many of them do all right. (Every marriage is &quot;mixed&quot; to 
<br>
some extent, since no two people are identical.)
<br>
<p>Second, there may be special problems in the cryonics case. The reluctant 
<br>
spouse may not have had advance warning. The unpopularity of cryonics makes 
<br>
negativity easier. Money is involved. There may be family and social 
<br>
pressures.
<br>
<p>Yet the actual statistical experience is hopeful. I don't have exact figures 
<br>
handy, but there are many times as many spouses who are tolerant, or even 
<br>
convert, as with random individuals. I don't know of many cases in which the 
<br>
spouse's reluctance actually resulted in failure to freeze. 
<br>
<p>This clearly stems mainly from three factors. First, the love relationship 
<br>
predisposes less automatic hostility and toward loyalty; she probably wants 
<br>
to give you the benefit of the doubt. Second, the spouse is exposed to much 
<br>
more valid cryonics information than the average person. Finally, it is 
<br>
usually more unpleasant to break up the marriage, or allow a continuing 
<br>
irritant, than to be tolerant at least--it is rarely a big sacrifice.
<br>
<p>As to tactics, the following seem to be usually helpful:
<br>
<p>Don't ask permission; just explain your choice. If she is reluctant, be firm. 
<br>
Make it clear that, regardless of your love, you will not sacrifice your life 
<br>
for her, and that there is no chance of your being persuaded to give up 
<br>
cryonics. Take it or leave it.
<br>
<p>Avoid confrontation or reproach. Pressing the issue, raising your voice or 
<br>
questioning her intelligence won't help. 
<br>
<p>Make it clear that, if necessary, after revival you will make a new life 
<br>
without her--but it would pain you deeply to lose her, and you would be very 
<br>
much happier if she could share your opportunity.
<br>
<p>Occasionally, if it isn't too blatant, implied bargaining can help. Give her 
<br>
something she wants, without explicitly demanding any quid pro quo. Be extra 
<br>
considerate, which is usually a good idea anyway.
<br>
<p>If your growing children are available as allies, or other friends or 
<br>
relatives or acquaintances, use them. If she can meet other cryonicists, she 
<br>
is likely to be impressed with their quality.
<br>
<p>Be patient, if there is no likely early emergency. Time is on your side (even 
<br>
though nobody knows how much time he has).  Her continued exposure to 
<br>
cryonics information, the stream of new break-throughs in science and 
<br>
medicine, and the slowly receding public negativity, should have a cumulative 
<br>
effect.
