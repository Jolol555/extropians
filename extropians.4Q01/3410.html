</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That is in no way implied in the above quote.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yes, they do find them disturbing. The only scenario where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists win is if those who find them disturbing join the terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fighting against the government over this issue. It is a proven fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that standard revolutionary insurgency doctrine does not work if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient majority of the population trusts the government enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow it to engage in temporary, targeted, forms of repression that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically focused on the sources of insurgency.
</em><br>
<p>Now, just sit back and read what you are saying.
<br>
&quot;temporary, targeted, forms of repression that are specifically focused&quot;
<br>
<p><p>This is all well and good in a perfect society.
<br>
<p>But no such thing exists. So, are you going to trust *your* government
<br>
to carry out such acts?
<br>
In secret? I certainly wouldn't.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We see this occuring in the wake of 911 where you get 80%+ support from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the african-american community for the profiling of arab/muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals by law enforcement. So long as this sort of repression is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not broad based: i.e. profiling african americans as well, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population will support the government actions.
</em><br>
<p>What is that Quote from Pastor Niemoller (I am writing this offline so I
<br>
can't do a search) about &quot;first they came for the communists, but I
<br>
wasn't worried, I'm not a communist, then they came for the
<br>
socialists...&quot;
<br>
<p>This is a really slippery slope which I don't think any government
<br>
should even consider entering into. The only time such actions would be
<br>
justified would be during an actual war, or an actual insurgency, which
<br>
the United States certainly does not have at the moment. As it is, this
<br>
sort of repression would almost certainly breed the sort of resentment
<br>
which *creates* insurgencies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In insurgency doctrine, the point of triggering massive government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repression with atrocities is to get the government to oppress enough of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the population to feed a large growth in participation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-government activities, which leads to more atrocities by terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more repression by government.
</em><br>
<p>But at this point in time there is, as far as I am aware *no* active
<br>
insurgency underway in the US, and so this totally over-the-top
<br>
situation you are describing is irrelevant.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The problem in this calculus of force is in predicting the balance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the public perceptions about the atrocities committed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists and the proportionality or weightedness of the response by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government. If the government's repression following the atrocity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen as less severe than the atrocity itself, public support remains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the government. A revolutionary needs the government to overreact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and for media sources to widely sensationalize any overreaction.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. But if the government is going around oppressing an entire class
<br>
of people, eventually you will alienate those people, as a group, and
<br>
then your insurgency will begin. It just breeds itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For this reason, I look at the anthrax attacks with a suspicious view.
</em><br>
<p>Well, not to mention the possibility of it being other people than those
<br>
who did the September 11 attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By targeting members of the media, especially those who have records of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensationalism and/or sentiment toward left wing anti-government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions, the media has specifically been turned into a tool of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensationalism against government into one of its biggest supporters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thus they tend to downplay any repression the government does engage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in, since in their own biased editorial view, it is at least partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified, if not fully justified.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I guess it is hard to be objective when your life is at stake.
<br>
Did they target members of the media who have such a background? Not
<br>
being an American, I know very little about US media, other than the
<br>
fact that CNN seems to be awash in Australian presenters, unless they
<br>
employ regional presenters. I've been highly amused by various US
<br>
conspiracy nuts sounding off at all of the &quot;British&quot; accents on CNN,
<br>
smelling a plot. (We're after your ski fields. Ours suck).
