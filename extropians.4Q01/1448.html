<p>Testing times
<br>
Oct 18th 2001 
<br>
<em>&gt;From The Economist print edition
</em><br>
<p>Instant screening for anthrax is now possible
<br>
<p>THE difficulty of isolating, growing and distributing suitably lethal
<br>
strains of anthrax means that serious biological attacks have, so far,
<br>
been mercifully few and far between. This is, however, of little comfort
<br>
to the large numbers of people opening letters or parcels containing a
<br>
mysterious powdery substance that turns out to be something innocent, or
<br>
a hoax. 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, the two established methods for identifying anthrax and
<br>
other microbial contaminants involve time-consuming laboratory
<br>
techniques. 
<br>
<p>One is to try to culture an organism from the powder, and then subject
<br>
it to a barrage of chemical tests to identify it. 
<br>
<p>The other is to amplify and identify its DNA. 
<br>
<p>The first takes days, and the second is a sophisticated technique that
<br>
few laboratories are yet able to manage. So, even if the result is
<br>
negative, chaos may already have been caused and the act of terrorism
<br>
rewarded. 
<br>
<p>A better solution would be to screen on the spot. And technology to do
<br>
this is now available. It uses a test strip, costing $20, that looks
<br>
like a pregnancy-detection kit. 
<br>
<p>The Guardian Bio-Threat Alert System is a joint development by Alexeter
<br>
Technologies, based in Wheeling, Illinois, and Tetracore, of
<br>
Gaithersburg, Maryland. It takes 15 minutes to react to the presence of
<br>
anthrax, and it is the only rapid field test now available. 
<br>
<p>Tom Fryzel, the marketing manager of Alexeter Technologies, says that in
<br>
the past fortnight the company has shipped what would normally be three
<br>
months' inventory to emergency services, corporate-security outfits,
<br>
groups connected with the armed forces and a few places that you can
<br>
probably imagine but we cannot talk about. 
<br>
<p>The test is done by shaking up a sample of the suspect material in a
<br>
proprietary solution, and then placing drops of the mixture on to the
<br>
strip. 
<br>
<p>Antibodies specific to anthrax are present on the strip and attach
<br>
themselves to any anthrax bacteria in the sample. When this happens, the
<br>
antibodies detach themselves from the strip and migrate along it, to
<br>
reveal two red stripes printed underneath. 
<br>
<p>For forensic purposes, each strip also carries a chip that stores its
<br>
manufacturing details. When a strip has been used, it is placed in a
<br>
unit which writes the results, along with the date, time and name of the
<br>
operator, into the chip. These data can then be made available to any
<br>
criminal investigation or legal case that results. 
<br>
<p>The founders of Tetracore were part of a team of scientists from the
<br>
Naval Medical Research Institute, in Bethesda, Maryland. They are now
<br>
working on new methods for detecting a range of infectious agents such
<br>
as plague and smallpox, using field versions of gene-amplification
<br>
technology. 
<br>
<p>A particularly promising line for the company is a genetic field test
<br>
for foot-and-mouth disease, which it hopes will be brought out in Brazil
<br>
this week. The test works in an hour, and can detect the virus even
<br>
before symptoms have appeared.
<br>
<p>Anthrax-detection strips seem likely to become a common feature in the
<br>
postrooms of large organisations. They will not, however, give absolute
<br>
assurance. A negative response still has to be checked in the
<br>
laboratory. But it provides enough certainty to avoid panic. 
<br>
<p>And a strong positive, according to Mr Fryzel, means that you might as
<br>
well close the doors and round people up there and then.
