</em><br>
<p>It is not in contradiction, it simply models on the assumption that the
<br>
changes in population pondered are in excess of the ability of
<br>
technological changes to mitigate for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;limited resources theory&quot; does not explain the higher rates of violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes in the US compared to countries with the same standard of living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Europe, Japan, Australia) - unless you propose that Americans &quot;need&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly more resources than others (cf. population density,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollution, etc.).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO, the ideology of limited resources we have to fight about is only good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for extremists (left or right) who prefer to steal from others, instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploring new opportunities.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily. If population changes exceed technological changes,
<br>
then conditions of scarcity are imposed.
<br>
<p>The claims made by Meadows, Capra, et al about Americans allegedly
<br>
'consuming' greater resources is highly inaccurate. If such a disparity
<br>
existed, it would be reflected in trade patterns. The models used by
<br>
such people are highly erroneous.
<br>
<p>The largest error is that of land use. The US has a rather low
<br>
population density, of around 27 people per square mile or some such.
<br>
The 'American's Use More Resources than Anybody' myth is based largely
<br>
on this fact of low density, in that it assumes that a) all of the land
<br>
in the US is being used by all Americans (when, in fact, over 1/3 of the
<br>
land here is restricted to no use or limited use), that b) any given
<br>
acre has an equivalent resource 'value' as any other acre, here or in
<br>
other countries, and that c) the information provided by other
<br>
governments is to be treated as accurate (when in fact we know that few
<br>
governments ever tell the truth about their countries, the spread of
<br>
AIDS in Africa being a case in point). 
<br>
<p>Other errors used in these myths: they assume that all resources used
<br>
are used solely to the benefit of Americans, that the US does not
<br>
export, and that no US residents send money overseas to family or for
<br>
charitable use.
