<p>This sounds like a perfectly legitimate criticism to me.  We're a big
<br>
honkin' superpower with the world's most powerful economy (still), not to
<br>
mention nuclear weapons.  How much looking after do American interests
<br>
need?
<br>
<p>America has decided to play global policeman.  A police officer may
<br>
receive a salary for services rendered, but the job is to look out for the
<br>
community's interests, hopefully as defined by the just laws of a
<br>
democratic government.  If America is projecting all this military force
<br>
abroad to look out for her own interests, then America is playing global
<br>
bully, not global policeman, and the other countries should band together
<br>
to oppose her, as villagers once banded together to oppose roving bandits.
<br>
<p>Well, America isn't projecting all this force to look out for her own
<br>
interests.  America has decided to play global policeman, and more or less
<br>
lived up to it.  But we have to go on living up to our own declared
<br>
principles - whether or not anyone else gives us credit for it, if it
<br>
comes down to that.  So if someone claims that America is abusing her
<br>
position as global policeman to promote America's interest at the expense
<br>
of the global community, it's a real accusation; if correct, it's a real
<br>
problem.  Personally I think that America has been doing astonishingly
<br>
well for a global police officer with no global police supervisor, no
<br>
global police chief, no global office of internal affairs, and no global
<br>
legislature.  But that isn't an excuse for tolerating the remaining flaws.
<br>
<p>Above all, I think that America's choice to play global policeman, and
<br>
success in doing so more or less ethically, is a glorious triumph - a
<br>
precious, fragile, and potentially transient triumph, like democracy or
<br>
civil liberties.  So I am perturbed when I hear someone say that we should
<br>
just throw that away and start looking out after our own interests. 
<br>
America *has* managed to look out for everyone else's interests and we
<br>
need to go on doing so.
<br>
<p>Besides, this isn't the 19th century.  This is the age of nuclear
<br>
weapons.  America's primary, overshadowing global interest is the
<br>
continuing stability of the world and the nonuse of weapons of mass
<br>
destruction.  If shortsighted opportunism interferes with this, America's
<br>
*real* global interest, then shortsighted opportunism can take a hike.
