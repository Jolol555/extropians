<p>Yes, but when it is said by an FDA representative it carries a
<br>
certain amount of weight -- the tone suggested it was being
<br>
used in the context of -- &quot;since it isn't a disease, we aren't
<br>
going to approve any drugs or devices that prevent it&quot;.
<br>
<p>That is precisely the case with Alteon's protein un-crosslinker.
<br>
Its being approved a a blood-pressure lowering drug -- not an
<br>
anti-aging therapeutic.  While that strategy may work for some
<br>
of the more serious aspects of aging, when we start to get into
<br>
more subtle effects (where it is very hard to show clinical
<br>
symptons, but the effects of having them for many years --
<br>
as is the case with diabetes -- is to shorten your life.
<br>
It took many many years to recognize that close regulation
<br>
of glucose levels has a health enhancing and life prolonging
<br>
effect even though I think the protein glycosylation theory
<br>
of aging is one of the oldest.
<br>
<p>One of the problems with the field of &quot;anti-aging&quot; medicine is that due
<br>
to the activities of less-than-rigorous organizations (e.g. A4M) a lot
<br>
of hype has crept into the field.  That annoys the FDA, perhaps
<br>
justifiably so.
