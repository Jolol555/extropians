<p><em>&gt; technical question or even over politics, but this issue is not something abstract,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it involves my survival and I take it personally.
</em><br>
<p>I know the feeling. You know, Samantha's trying to criticize the US
<br>
government and that's just fine, a popular pastime around here, in
<br>
fact. A goodly portion the list probably wouldn't mind getting rid of
<br>
the bureaucrats altogether (by nonviolent means and after this crisis
<br>
has passed, naturally).
<br>
<p>The reason Samantha is eliciting so many angry and pained reactions is
<br>
that she can't seem to do this without also seeming to defend the
<br>
Islamofascists.
<br>
<p>It's the difference between saying &quot;Germany got treated unfairly and
<br>
with unnecessary harshness after WWI&quot; and saying &quot;Germany's behavior
<br>
during WWII was justified by how it was treated after WWI&quot;.
<br>
<p>Yes, yes, I know I've just invoked Godwin's law. I guess this thread
<br>
is dead then, huh? Perhaps that's for the best, I doubt anybody going
<br>
to change their minds about anything at this point.
<br>
