<p>
here is an article i found the other day that seems to have found a new
<br>
twist on this subject, this possibly is related to entanglement in some
<br>
way, but either way it seems to achieve the desired result
<br>

<p><p><p>Welsh scientists find order in chaos 
<br>
6/10/2001 
<br>
There is apparently some semblance of order in the weird world of chaos
<br>
after all. 
<br>
<p>In a groundbreaking experiment, electronic engineers at the University
<br>
of Wales, Bangor have proven that with two systems in a chaotic
<br>
environment, one of them is able to anticipate a signal from the other
<br>
before it is even sent. 
<br>
<p>This extraordinary saga began twelve months when a German physicist, Dr
<br>
Henning Voss at the University of Freiburg, controversially suggested
<br>
that it was theoretically possible for a state of what he called
<br>
&quot;anticipating synchronization' to exist when two duplicate systems exist
<br>
within a 'chaotic' or apparently random environment. 
<br>
<p>In simple terms he was putting forward the notion that under such
<br>
conditions it was possible for a duplicate system to anticipate changes
<br>
in the original system. It would achieve this by receiving a signal a
<br>
fraction of a second before it was actually transmitted. 
<br>
<p>However, since that time this proposition has remained no more than an
<br>
intriguing theory. That is until now. Bringing it firmly into the
<br>
practical world of reality, the team at Bangor has just announced a
<br>
successful experimental demonstration of it by using light signals
<br>
transmitted by chaotic semiconductor lasers. 
<br>
<p>In an article in this months Physical Review of Letters, the leading
<br>
international journal of physics, Professor Alan Shore describes how he
<br>
and his colleagues achieved this remarkable feat. 
<br>
<p>He is an electronic engineer working in the field of laser cryptography
<br>
- using lasers in a chaotic state for the secure transmission of data.
<br>
In 'traditional' optical transmission, lasers are used to send data via
<br>
fibre optic cables in non chaotic form. In this mode the message travels
<br>
at the speed of light. Work in transmitting data in chaotic form is
<br>
leading towards greater security of transmission. 
<br>
<p>The data is 'wrapped' in a chaotic signal which is created by using a
<br>
simple mirror to reflect light back into the laser. The data can only be
<br>
deciphered at the receiver by using an identical chaotic signal to
<br>
unravel the signal. 
<br>
<p>This is possible when the transmitter is used to drive the receiver in
<br>
such a way that the chaotic dynamics of transmitter and receiver become
<br>
identical - this is termed chaos synchronization. 
<br>
<p>In the first experimental demonstration of anticipating synchronization,
<br>
the laser transmitted a continuous fluctuating signal in chaotic form.
<br>
The changes in the pattern of the signal were recorded at the
<br>
transmitter and receiver. 
<br>
<p>Uncannily, the receiver recorded changes in the signal nanoseconds
<br>
before the transmitter recorded the transmission of those changes-
<br>
thereby anticipating the synchronization of transmitter and receiver.
<br>
The anticipation time was found to be equal to the time of flight from
<br>
the transmitter to the receiver. 
<br>
<p>&quot;At present, we cannot fully explain our observations.&quot; says Professor
<br>
Shore. &quot;We had expected that the anticipation time would depend upon the
<br>
time taken for the light to travel between the laser and the external
<br>
mirror which is used to drive the laser into chaos. We are currently
<br>
developing a theoretical explanation of our observations. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Synchronization of chaotic external cavity lasers and message
<br>
transmission and extraction has been accomplished and has been
<br>
demonstrated by a number of groups including our own,&quot; said Professor
<br>
Shore. 
<br>
<p>&quot;In order to carry forward this concept into practical use it is now
<br>
necessary to confront basic performance issues and, in particular, to
<br>
determine the rates at which information can be transmitted. Laboratory
<br>
experiments have already confirmed the GHz message transmission
<br>
capabilities of semiconductor lasers. 
<br>
<p>&quot;One of the difficulties faced in developing the use of synchronized
<br>
lasers for secure transmission is that there is a finite 'time of
<br>
flight' between the transmitter and the receiver. 
<br>
<p>&quot;As the distance between transmitter and receiver is increased it could
<br>
be considered that a basic limitation on system operation can be
<br>
established due to the time it takes to synchronize the receiver and the
<br>
transmitter. Indeed previous laboratory experimental demonstrations of
<br>
laser chaos synchronization have shown that the receiver 'lags' the
<br>
transmitter. 
<br>
<p>&quot;What we have reproduced, however, is the state which was theorized by
<br>
Voss of the University of Freiburg, in which when working with chaotic
<br>
electronic oscillators, the receiver leads or 'anticipates' the
<br>
transmitter.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;The work undertaken in our laboratory has provided the first
<br>
experimental confirmation of the appearance of anticipated
<br>
synchronization in chaotic external cavity lasers and indeed in any
<br>
physical system. A particularly important feature of the experimental
<br>
results is the demonstration that the 'anticipation time' is precisely
<br>
the 'time of flight' between the lasers. 
<br>
<p>:The significance of this observation for chaotic communications is
<br>
immediately apparent : operating in a regime of anticipating chaos would
<br>
ensure that the 'time of flight ' is not a fundamental constraint on
<br>
system performance. We are actively exploring a number of other
<br>
issuesrelevant to chaotic optical communications which follow from our
<br>
observations. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The essential feature of the chaotic laser system we have studied is
<br>
the finite time delay associated with the round-trip time of light in
<br>
the laser external cavity. We point out that finite time delays are
<br>
ubiquitous. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We would thus expect that any of those analogous systems which exhibit
<br>
chaos should also be liable to anticipating synchronization. We thus
<br>
hope that our work will act as a stimulus to explore the opportunities
<br>
for observing anticipating synchronization in physical, chemical,
<br>
biological and socio-economic systems.&quot;
