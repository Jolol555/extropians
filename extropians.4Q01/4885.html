<p><em>&gt; Of course, it is entirely because of this attitude that the 911 attacks

<p>The problem with this statement is that it presumes that it is possible to
<br>
determine the course of future events. How do you know that the individual
<br>
you are detaining at the moment should be 'interrogated further', with all
<br>
the abrogation of human rights that entails? If that helps mitigate horrific
<br>
crimes in the future then sure, deploy utilitarian arguments. But how do you
<br>
know in advance? And how do you decide when (and how) to stop the
<br>
interrogation if you haven't found out the plot that you &quot;know&quot; can be
<br>
thwarted, if only you interrogate a bit harder?

<em>&gt; Outside of OBL and al Qaeda, the rest of the blame for 9-11 falls
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think this is a very unfortunate statement that you might like to retract.
<br>
I don't see any similarity between the activities of an organisation that
<br>
seeks to defend civil liberties in the US and a terrorist organisation
<br>
responsible for thousands of murders.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
