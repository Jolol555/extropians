<p>
&lt;&lt;For your edification:
<br>
<p><a href="http://dieoff.org/page45.htm">http://dieoff.org/page45.htm</a>&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Consider me somewhat more edified.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Simon asserts that we will &quot;dig deeper and pump faster&quot; and find more oil. 
<br>
One wonders why the oil geologists hadn't thought of that, as U.S. production 
<br>
goes down and reserves decline&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yet, there have been advances and success in new discoveries and recovery of 
<br>
oil since 1992, when Lindsey Grant wrote this article. its not pump harder 
<br>
and dig deeper, as the author indicated, but rather, know where to drill, use 
<br>
the proper geophysical model for extracting petroleum, and be prepared to 
<br>
wait until the right price comes along.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Cornucopians by their nature tend to emphasize solutions where 
<br>
environmentalists emphasize problems. An interchange can be useful. Do the 
<br>
environmentalists overstate difficulties and fail to recognize new directions 
<br>
that can be helpful? Have we explored the opportunities presented by the 
<br>
oceans, by recent breakthroughs in biology, and by electronics and data 
<br>
processing as thoroughly as we have explored the dangers from 
<br>
desertification, deforestation, and acid rain?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, now the first sentence is a show-stopper for me. If one emphasizes 
<br>
problems, we now have a guidepost for what the writer is really about, which 
<br>
is making demands on whomever will pay attention to them. Anyone can present 
<br>
problems, but coming up with viable solutions is quite another thing. My 
<br>
admiration for Paul &quot;Population Bomb&quot; Ehrlich ended long ago.
