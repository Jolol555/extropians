<em>&gt;                 and FedEx lost millions on ZAPmail.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The Fedex model is completely different than my proposal. For ZAPmail,
<br>
sender and receiver agree to use Fedex's fax machines instead of their
<br>
own. As you say, by the time Fedex got their fancy Faxes installed,
<br>
everybody else already had Fax.
<br>
<p>My proposal is driven by the recipient's desire to avoid handling paper
<br>
mail when the sender sends it. By centralizing mail handling and then
<br>
sending only images, the receiver gains a lot of benefits: The originals
<br>
can be stored centrally, the interoffice mail is delivered more quickly, 
<br>
and mail handling can be automated. I would estimate that at
<br>
least 90 percent of sealed mail could be delivered by image
<br>
(If you've ever worked in the mailroom, please comment on this.)

<p>If you are a venture capitalist, please fund this development :-)
