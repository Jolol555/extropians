Much food for thought here. Please don't take any of the below as &quot;dicksizing&quot;--I'm speaking frankly to save time.

<em>&gt; On another Spike Jones inspired tangent, I have been told by Army friends that the army teaches troops how to shoot down low flying aircraft as a team effort.  Obviously, the more rifles aimed at a plane, the more bullets being shot at a plane, and so, the odds being that much better of the plane being shot down!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We should all form up into little &quot;shooting clubs&quot; to keep our neighborhoods safe.  Mike Lorrey should be put in charge of the online effort to organize this!  I bet now redneck areas of this country will now be seen as the safest!!  Those poor New Yorkers(like my father) need the right to carry firearms now more then ever.
</em><br>
<p>I think I mentioned that in my earlier post: three guys with .223s vs. one guy with something in .30.
<br>
<p>If one lived in a state where tracers are legal, or if one were willing to engage in serious (potential felony charges)
<br>
civil disobedience, one might practice quick controlled groups (pairs or triples): tracer followed by 
<br>
one or two 55-grain ball or SS109 light armor piercing rounds. And for a target drone, maybe an RC airplane towing
<br>
something. 
<br>
<p>Hmm. For once, that silly triple-round-burst auto setting on the current M-16s has a use. Whaddayaknow...
<br>
<p>Don't set your neighbors on fire, now, y'hear? And good luck finding a 6-mile range, even over open water. 
<br>
Camp Peary, anyone?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm just concerned about about becoming a casualty in this patriotic effort.  You may not get too many shots off before the poison gas does you in!  
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; And what if you shoot down the plane thinking you are alright, when in fact you have been exposed to a horrible disease like anthrax?  Well, at least you possibly limited the area directly infected.
</em><br>
<p>As my guidance counselor used to say, &quot;And how old will you be in four years if you *don't* go to school?&quot;
<br>
If you're not determined to fight in &quot;go-to-hell&quot; style, you probably shouldn't fight. I hear Belize is nice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should we all go and buy gasmasks, or even full biohazard suits?
</em><br>
<p>Good luck getting a good price. It's hard to determine the utility of canisters that were manufactured for
<br>
Israel in 1971. How were they stored? Etc.
<br>
<p>Full-on suits are very uncomfortable, and you probably won't get the atropine ampoule and needle included in the
<br>
price. So much depends on the agent and the dose.
<br>
<p>If an attack is bio, rather than chem, assuming no open cuts and no direct contact with spores, etc., 
<br>
your lungs are your first thing to protect, your eyes and mucosa (lips, etc.) are the next most important. 
<br>
<p>There are lots of OSHA style respirators that might provide some protection. 
<br>
<p>Few would be effective against very small airborne virus particles, but they might still stop &quot;wet&quot; aerosol 
<br>
droplets cold. The desired filter size is around .5 micron if you can get it. And lose the beard, if you've
<br>
got one, or use a lot of vaseline and hope for the best.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And walking around in such garb with a rifle slung over my shoulder could give people reason to panic...
</em><br>
<p>This is true; this is today. Consider:
<br>
How much can you pack in a gym bag? How often can you practice donning, assembling, loading and taking aim?
<br>
What are the odds you'll be effective?
<br>
What are the odds you'll be braced as a potential crazy by the gendarmes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think for any cryonicists among us, it could be a smart move to keep a big vat of liquid nitrogen in the garage.  Should you be infected with a deadly disease, simply grit your teeth and gently fall into the vat.  I hate to think how painful it would briefly be, but try to think of the potential long term benefit!
</em><br>
<p>*Pfft*. I have a freezer contract.
<br>
<p>I want my death to have meaning, if possible. I'd like to help build a world that wouldn't mind bringing
<br>
me (/us) back, and _most importantly_, a world I wouldn't mind coming back to. 
<br>
<p>These three desiderata are, for me, in ascending importance. YMMV.
<br>
<p>If I had a wife and kids, I'd probably have other priorities.
