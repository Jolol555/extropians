<p>Thanks a bunch Doug.  
<br>
<p>How sweet it is that this list has a genuine,
<br>
certified, card-carrying rocket scientist ready to
<br>
respond to that sudden emergency.  You know, that
<br>
unquenchable nerd-boy jones for a fix of the real

savory high-signal flavor.
<br>
<p>Ain't the extropian lifestyle grand!
<br>
<p>Oh, and thanks also to Doug's faithful indian

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------
<br>
<p>Plaudits taken care of, on to substance.
<br>
<p>There were some comments about micrometeorite damage. 
<br>
Recently, there was an event in the news about a
<br>
Russian-launched, US space society, inflation-deployed
<br>
scaled-down version of a solar sail.  As I understand
<br>
it this item was to be deployed and held open by a
<br>
circumferential inflated tube.  I've also heard of
<br>
other designs using straight tubes in a spoke-like
<br>
arrangement.  IMO these are all worthy approaches. 
<br>
The inflation concept does require that we deal with
<br>
the micrometeorite puncture deflation issue, but I
<br>
don't see it as a difficult problem, solvable, as
<br>
someone mentioned, by the injection of expansion foam
<br>
that then hardens, ie, styrofoam or a
<br>
whatever-is-more-appropriate-for-the-conditions
<br>
alternative. 
<br>
<p>(As I understand it, some foams are &quot;blown&quot;, which I
<br>
take to mean mixed under pressure with the inflation
<br>
agent and then extruded from high pressure to low,
<br>
where the agent expands, and with it the foam. CFC's
<br>
in liquid form and nitrogen are two of the expansion
<br>
agents I've heard of. Then there seem to be foams
<br>
which chemically generate the gas which then expands
<br>
the mixture, much as bread rises due to the generation
<br>
of CO2 by the on-board yeast.) 
<br>
<p>Obviously, such a foam would be transported to the
<br>
building site in compact liquid form.  Does anyone
<br>
have an idea of how little expansion agent one might
<br>
get away with when expanding into the ultimate low
<br>
pressure environment of the vacuum of space?
<br>
<p>So hardened foams don't deflate.
<br>
<p>The backing for a solar reflector is just one--a
<br>
somewhat mundane one IMO--of many possible space-based
<br>
applications of foam.  (I recommend a thread dedicated
<br>
to Building Materials and Methods in Space, with The
<br>
Uses of Foam in Space as a subthread.)  Prior threads
<br>
for example, have dealt with the problem posed by
<br>
space junk.  A large foam sphere, or a suitably thick
<br>
layer of cladding around a space &quot;station&quot; might prove
<br>
an effective debris collector/shielding.  Impacting
<br>
bodies would easily penetrate a thin but tough
<br>
skin--to minimize fragmentation near the
<br>
surface--making a small hole, then gradually
<br>
decelerate through layers of increasing density.  
<br>
Junk checks in but it doesn't check out!  
<br>
<p>Micrometeorite damage to the reflector: I agree, as
<br>
someone mentioned, that it would seem non-critical
<br>
since it would effect, IMO, with the possible
<br>
exception of grazing impacts, a virtually
<br>
imperceptible fraction of the total reflective
<br>
surface.  
<br>
<p>The issue of degradation due to atomic oxygen seems
<br>
inherently connected to a location in low earth orbit.
<br>
&nbsp;As Gene observes, leo is primarily useful as a place
<br>
to pass through on your way to somewhere you really
<br>
want to go, someplace, anyplace, higher up.  So it's
<br>
&quot;Up and away&quot;, and away from atomic oxygen.
<br>
<p>On stabilization.  Maybe spin stabilization is not the
<br>
way to go, but the conserved nature of that angular
<br>
momentum vector has a track record, and really appeals
<br>
to me.  How to keep such a system pointed at the sun,
<br>
and compensate for deflections due to external forces:
<br>
solar(and terrestrial, lunar,  stellar, and cosmic)
<br>
radiation pressure, solar wind, magnetic fields, and
<br>
space &quot;dust&quot;? (Forget atmospheric drag--see previous
<br>
paragraph).  First, regarding the disturbing forces:
<br>
they will be small to begin with, but--in the case of
<br>
a solar reflector--the resultant forces for solar
<br>
wind, and radiation pressure should act through the
<br>
center of rotation, reducing the rotational
<br>
disturbance from these two sources to near zero.  This
<br>
leaves only very small unbalanced disturbances to be
<br>
compensated for--unless we're talking ultra-humongus
<br>
mega dish.  To compensate for disturbances and
<br>
maintain accurate orientation, I would propose a set
<br>
of small, light, high-speed flywheels.  Since, over
<br>
the course of one revolution around the sun, the
<br>
angular momentum vector must be caused to rotate 360
<br>
degrees, the net change ends up being zero.  The
<br>
flywheels just suck up the angular momentum in one
<br>
half of the cycle and return it during the other half.
<br>
To whatever extent the rotational disturbances also
<br>
tend to average out over the period of one revolution,
<br>
torquing first one way and then the other, then, for
<br>
these disturbances as well, the flywheels, will cycle,
<br>
loading up in one half of a rotational period and
<br>
unloading in the other half.  If they ever do reach
<br>
the limit of their capacity, then they can be
<br>
jettisoned along with their cargo of &quot;waste&quot; momentum,
<br>
and replaced with a new &quot;empty&quot; set of flywheels.  (I
<br>
read up on flywheels recently and recall two
<br>
applications for use in space.  Energy storage as an
<br>
alternative to battery use, and orientation
<br>
stabilization as an alternative to reaction jets. 
<br>
Beyond that, I freely admit, I may be talking out my
<br>
asteroid.)  
<br>
<p>Finally, a suggestion regarding the gun launch
<br>
concept.  Get past the Babylon gun.  It's just a
<br>
starting point.  I suggest a longer tube for more
<br>
velocity and/or lower g forces, located in the ocean
<br>
for easy building and maneuvering--think of the butt
<br>
end in the depths of the Marianas trench.  This gives
<br>
you a ten mile length at an inclination of 45 degrees.
<br>
<p>That's all I have time for for now. 
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
