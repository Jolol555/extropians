</em><br>
<em>&gt; purported explanation.
</em><br>
<p>So, basically, most human societies are sexist fundamentalist sects in
<br>
particular. Wow, that's a pretty radical, ethnocentric statement. But
<br>
I find myself agreeing with it-- you're not the easiest person to
<br>
disagree with. So, is this inequality between males and females you
<br>
mention in passing a problem? Should something be done about it,
<br>
perhaps? Might sexism go hand-in-hand with other, less obvious social
<br>
problems?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is also good to point out that most Americans are ignorant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bystanders of the forces involved.  It would be quite beneficial
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Facile and biased interpretations will not help us.
</em><br>
<p>Our gov has done some dastardly things and we are paying for them.
<br>
Okay, no argument there. After defeating the Taliban and punishing Bin
<br>
Bacon (if he's still around) we should reduce our commitments abroad
<br>
and let some sunshine in on the secretive corridors of state (as an
<br>
intermediate step to anarchotopia, of course). I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Reducing dependence on nuclear energy makes no sense at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without it we will not replace dependence on mid east oil.  And
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thank you for saying it like it is about anti-nuke hysteria.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The stuff by &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter is truly bizarre.  I do not consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this creature a friend and I am amazed and mightily discouraged
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>He certainly does come across sounding as amoral... to *us*. But,
<br>
the reason he has the ears of those in power is that he starts out
<br>
from where he agrees with them and then branches out into his own
<br>
opinions as necessary conclusions of the agreed-upon premises. I
<br>
don't think he'd have anybody's ear if he started out saying:
<br>
<p>&quot;You are wrong and your enemy is right&quot;
<br>
<p>I wonder what we could learn from that...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no &quot;supreme authority&quot; in Buddhism or even in but one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variant of Catholicism.  A fatwa is a relgiously inspired
</em><br>
<p>How many variants of Catholicism are there? The one with the
<br>
Microsoftean market share is the supreme authority one as I recall...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; peaceful religion.  This is the equivalent of claiming a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pronoucement by a local judge determines the goodness of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign policy or of our culture or can set us to destroying all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are not American. It is an outrageous and meaningless claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in both cultures.
</em><br>
<p>So the fatwa against Americans doesn't really have a solid theological
<br>
basis. Now there's a memetic countermeasure we could use on the
<br>
Jihadists. That is, when we can re-establish our credibility with the
<br>
normal people of the region.
<br>
<p>Hmm. I find us in agreement more and more, Samantha. Are you coming
<br>
around, or am I?
