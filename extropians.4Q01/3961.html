<p>&quot;There is an asymmetry in the nature of the arguments of the 
<br>
environmentalists and the cornucopians. The environmentalist—the
<br>
proponent of corrective action—is (or should be) simply warning of 
<br>
consequences if trends or problems are ignored; he or she
<br>
does not need to predict. The cornucopian, on the other hand, must predict 
<br>
to make his or her case. He must argue that
<br>
problems will be solved and good things will happen if we let nature take 
<br>
its course. Since nobody has yet been able to predict
<br>
the future, cornucopian are asking their listeners to take a lot on faith. 
<br>
They say, in effect, &quot;Believe as I do, and you will feel
<br>
better.&quot; Simon says explicitly that his conversion to his present viewpoint 
<br>
improved his state of mind.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok, the article did have some good points (though I'd like to hear 
<br>
a detailed rebuttal), but the above statement is wrong.  If 
<br>
environmentalists and cornucopians were just arguing in ivory towers, then 
<br>
yes, the burden of proof would be on the party making the definite claim 
<br>
about the nature of the future.  However, this debate is really about 
<br>
policy, or the need for &quot;corrective action,&quot; changing the burden of 
<br>
proof.  In this case, simply not letting things take their course is not an 
<br>
options, a specific set of remedies needs to be proposed or nothing can be 
<br>
done.  Having to make specific recommendations, and thus a specific model 
<br>
of the future brings the environmentalists back into the realm of precise 
<br>
predictions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the burden of proof naturally shifts with the introduction 
<br>
of specific plans, so that it is on the person who wants to change the 
<br>
status-quo.  Otherwise, we would never be able to pick one of two roughly 
<br>
equal courses of action, and would just oscillate between them.
