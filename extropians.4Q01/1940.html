<p><em>&gt;Who are &quot;them&quot; in the above?  The Muslims in general?

<p>Yes, but mostly the ones I now refer to as Janus Muslims, two-

<p><em>&gt;Is this a necessarily bad thing?  I think it would be a damn

</em><br>
<p>I don't think it's the appropriate time for it. This is supposed to
<br>
be about terrorism. We are after the people who murdered our
<br>
citizens. The focus should be on that and that alone.
<br>
<p>The average person on the streets in the middle east has been
<br>
watching the agitprop coming from Al-Jazeera, they think the
<br>
Israelis destroyed the World Trade Center!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think we're on the wrong track. I think we're screwing around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and we need to get serious.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;What does serious look like if you think what is currently being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;done is not serious?  
</em><br>
<p>Even the Pentagon is admitting they have made at least two key
<br>
mistakes so far.
<br>
<p>Serious to me? I would have put ground troops in with the northern
<br>
alliance and immediately moved to re-take Kabul, and Maziri-al-
<br>
sherif with all the air support required. Once an airbase had been
<br>
established I would have poured ground troops in.
<br>
<p>Once Kabul was re-taken and the Taliban rounded up, I would have
<br>
put in a call for U.N. peacekeepers to hold it and started flying
<br>
in humanitarian supplies. This would leave troops free to move on
<br>
and crush Kandahar.
