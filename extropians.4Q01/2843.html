<em>&gt; Afghanistan needs order, and some emergency relief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brian
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From Gino Strada, 
</em><br>
great surgeon, 
<br>
in Panshir, 
<br>
and now in Kabul,
<br>
founder of &quot;Emergency&quot;,
<br>
leftist-humanitarian.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And I fwd.
<br>
<p>----------
<br>
<p>November 1st, 2001
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Gino, Panshir, to all the friends of Emergency
</em><br>
<p>Time fliesä Those images symbolically atrocious of skyscrapers torn by
<br>
airplanes, those thousands of dead ones almost not seen - but imaginable in
<br>
all their desperate anguish - seems to me so very close in time, almost a
<br>
matter of days.Instead, 50 days have already past, 50 days of war. Every
<br>
minute broadcasted live, rivers of words, voices, analysis, inventions about
<br>
war.
<br>
<p>For a change I would be tempted to say up with tv coverage. I see that you
<br>
may wonder if I am fine or out of my mind but I will try anyhow to explain.
<br>
<p>First of all, here in Afghanistan, I can receive quite normally all tv
<br>
channels from Italy and other countries, so that I have the privilege of
<br>
hearing and seeing what is being said and what is being shown in Italy about
<br>
Afghanistanä while I rest on a straw mat and a small pillow in the Panshir
<br>
Valley.
<br>
<p>And be sure, sometimes it is really rewarding: you can savor &quot;Reporting from
<br>
the front line&quot; that come from locales where we regularly go to the market
<br>
to buy some vegetables, all flavored with footage of bombers that dash
<br>
through cloudy skies swollen with rain while here it is twenty days that
<br>
there is not a cloud to be seen. And so on and so forth, to come, but here I
<br>
would stop, to the comments of the &quot;politicians&quot; about Afghanistan,
<br>
terrorism, Islam.
<br>
<p>Really it is not the case, the urgency of the situation does not allow it,
<br>
to waste time to point the finger against this and that mocking their
<br>
ignorance and their obtusity. If I were in Italy, probably I would get as
<br>
mad as you are, but I think that this, at this time is of little value. What
<br>
counts, instead, is that this war, contrary to the Gulf war, can be seen.
<br>
<p>Perhaps somehow distorted - each reporter tends to bring water to the mill
<br>
of each mill's owner - but it is there, we can witness it. We can even watch
<br>
the newly named &quot;Arab CNN&quot;, Al Jazeera - by the way, can you imagine those
<br>
in Qatar define CNN as the &quot;American Al Jazeera&quot;? - And we can also follow
<br>
the tiny newly born EMERGENCY site named &quot;Another Afghanistan&quot;. For now is
<br>
just a bit more than a tiny window, but if many of us think about it and
<br>
work about it, if in many will be available to put in ideas, time,
<br>
professionality, it might become a very, very interesting project.
<br>
<p>Because this time we, too, can show the war: photos, witnesses, stories,
<br>
video clips (for these I am told there are some technical problems, but
<br>
nothing is impossible for the creativity of EMERGENCY). So far we have
<br>
documented victims: today we have again updated the list from Kabul, our
<br>
data are limited, but perhaps just because of their limitations, they are
<br>
true. Absolutely true. This is a great advantage that we have compared to
<br>
the televisions undeclared footage style, those that show marines with
<br>
painted faces, dashing through the palm tree of some asian jungle.
<br>
<p>We can show the war, and we will be able to continue showing it even when
<br>
the hundreds of reporters will have migrated towards &quot;new&quot; news. So we will
<br>
be able to give even further substance to our conferences, to the thousands
<br>
information and cultural initiatives that the EMERGENCY people are carrying
<br>
forward. Because there is only one war to show, that war made of dead and
<br>
wounded, made of lives and houses that are crashed, sacrificed to the
<br>
&quot;global war against terrorism&quot;.
<br>
<p>If we were able to develop our ability to communicate and reach many
<br>
persons, not only in Italy, we could really make some &quot;heavy&quot;information, of
<br>
the kind that cannot be ignored. Let us hope. For the time being a hug to
<br>
all of you.
<br>
<p>-Gino
