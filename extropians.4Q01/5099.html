Oh gosh, another series of sexist diatribes that I missed out on!  Darn.  Well, I just can't stand to see only the women getting away with blatant sexism, and poor Moloy stuck defending objectivity..
<br>
<p>So, my 2 sense  ;) : My personal experience of the past 53 years indicates that - 
<br>
<p>A&gt; While women will avoid violence in cases where they might get hurt, women as a class have no inherent qualms about inflicting it when they are safe.  (According to the feds, most road-rage incidents are caused by young women driving huge 4-bys.  And every professional driver I've asked has verified this.)  I've personally had people set up plans to kill me on several occasions, and in every case that comes to mind, it was a woman who instigated the plot, using sexual favors (implied or real) to motivate men to do the dirty work.
<br>
<p>B&gt; When most women are caught red-handed commiting some criminal or negligent act, they still try to bluff and bluster out of it.  And if that doesn't work, then they move to crying.  Until women were put on the spousal abuse squads (where they are still a minority), virtually 100% of the time, the man was hauled off.  Now that women are participating in the investigations and arrests, about 20% of the arrestees are women.  In my several years experience as a cab driver, my cab was rear-ended a dozen or more times, fortunately never very seriously.  I was also struck that way in or on my own vehicle a couple of times.  In every case but one, if it was a woman, she attacked me verbally right off the dime, making sarcastic remarks about whiplash lawsuite, etc.  In every case that it was a man, he went into abject aopologies over the incident.
