Randy Smith wrote in response to Miriam:
<br>
<p>And you wouldn't even own a house if someone hadn't sold you one.
<br>
So therefore I may sleep in your house whenever I please--free of charge of 
<br>
course.
<br>
<p>### I have some misgivings about getting involved in the discussion that
<br>
Randy started but, whatever. Here it goes.
<br>
<p>As an immigrant I represent a clear gain for the American society. I came
<br>
with excellent education (worth about 300 000$, counting the investment in
<br>
my childhood, grade school, high school, medical school, postgraduate
<br>
education, entirely paid by the taxpayers in Poland and Germany), good
<br>
health, decent work ethic. By competing with local physicians, I and other
<br>
IMG's (International Medical Graduates) contributed to the reduction in
<br>
healthcare cost growth rate that occurred in the last few years, while
<br>
maintaining a consistent standard of quality. 
<br>
<p>I do pay to sleep in my house. I own it. I am a taxpayer (even though I am
<br>
not allowed to vote - this is taxation without representation), and my money
<br>
goes toward the Social Security and welfare benefits of persons who do not
<br>
necessarily contribute to the American society but had the priviledge of
<br>
being born here. By the way, do you expect to receive such assistance or or
<br>
are you receiving it? If yes, some of it is my money.
<br>
<p>The question of regulating immigration can best be solved to the benefit of
<br>
the American nation by an impartial economic analysis aiming to optimize the
<br>
gains and reduce the losses due to immigration, both of which can be
<br>
measured. Cheap xenophobia will harm you. It will reduce your retirement
<br>
income.
