<p><em>&gt; Anyone know what the statistics are for the proportion of shots fired into

</em><br>
<p>No but we can estimate it thus: my neighborhood is a good example,
<br>
being fairly densely populated.  29 mortgages in an area roughly 2.4
<br>
acres, which is about 9600 square meters and there are about 100
<br>
proles in the hood, so about one prole per 96 square meters and
<br>
he is in only one of those and of that an area of about, hmmm, 30
<br>
cm on a side would cause him to expire so for each round fired
<br>
wildly skyward Im figuring about one in a thousand would slay,
<br>
assuming everyone is outdoors, with perhaps twice that many
<br>
injuries.
<br>
<p>In the event of such an attack, I figure a five hundred proles
<br>
squeeze off 10 rounds each to accumulate about a 50% chance
<br>
of a score, so we should expect about 5 deaths and 10 injuries
<br>
by falling bullets per shootfest.  Let us hope it never comes to
<br>
this.

<p><em>&gt; PG&amp;E reportedly had their regularly scheduled low-flying plane out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspecting the status of trees growing into power lines in the early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morning hours a week ago.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and I thought it extremely poor judgement on the part of that
<br>
public utility to pull such a stunt so soon after the announcement
<br>
that suspected terrorists were snooping around crop dusters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  911 got a lot of phone calls, and it ended up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the paper.  Luckily no one had their gun ready.  Chris
</em><br>
<p>Roger that.  I realized today an even better argument against
<br>
the small-arms-from-the-ground idea.  If the terrorists
<br>
have any brains, they would attack at night, after bashing
<br>
their running lights, so we would have no clue what we
<br>
were shooting.
<br>
<p>This realization convinced me to skip the 200 clams on
<br>
a 30.06 and instead to drop 20 on a box of rifled slugs for
<br>
Mister 12 Gauge.
<br>
<p>A far better idea is a ground based laser analogous to
<br>
the airborne and space based laser.  Radar could follow
<br>
suspicious aircraft and if mischief were detected, could
<br>
slice off a wing quicksmart.  spike
