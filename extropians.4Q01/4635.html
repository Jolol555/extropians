<p>
I rented the movie Memento over the weekend, an unusual film noire which
<br>
will be on many top ten lists this year.  I don't want to give away
<br>
the plot, which has a number of surprises and possible inconsistencies,
<br>
but rather to discuss some of the philosophical implications of the film.
<br>
<p>It is not a secret that the movie is about a man, Leonard, who due to an
<br>
injury has lost the ability to form long-term memories.  He can remember
<br>
everything up to the event, but since then he forgets everything that
<br>
has happened.  He can't retain a memory for more than 15 or 30 minutes,
<br>
sometimes less.
<br>
<p>Despite this handicap, Leonard has a goal.  As a substitute for long
<br>
term memory he makes notes to himself and carries labeled photographs.
<br>
And he is at least somewhat effective in making progress towards his
<br>
goal on a day to day basis.
<br>
<p>I see two connections between Leonard's situation and some of the
<br>
issues we have discussed.  One is the question of whether Leonard's
<br>
life has any meaning, and indeed whether in a meaningful sense he is
<br>
living at all.  With his memories constantly being erased, is there any
<br>
point to staying alive?  Dying would erase his memories and his future.
<br>
But his memories are already gone, and in a way the point of a future
<br>
is to give you new memories.  If those are going to be taken from you
<br>
as well, then what is the point of living?
<br>
<p>If you were in Leonard's situation, would you try to live, to improve
<br>
your life?  Or might one just as well give up?
<br>
<p>The second point is that if we manage to survive for a very long time,
<br>
our situation may be much like Leonard's.  If we reject the notion of
<br>
stasis, for what is the point of living forever if you are in a rut,
<br>
then we have to embrace change.  And with enough change, inevitably
<br>
the person you were before will be lost.  While the memories may not
<br>
be totally erased, still you will be effectively a different person and
<br>
the memories might as well belong to someone else.  Of course the time
<br>
horizon will be much larger; unlike Leonard's 15 minutes, we may have
<br>
a thousand subjective years of continuity.  But beyond that threshold,
<br>
we will not be the same person.  Like Leonard, our life will be a series
<br>
of time-bounded moments, with continuity and causality linking them,
<br>
but no sense of common identity.
<br>
<p>Some have argued that such a picture is appealing because even though
<br>
they will change so much as to be unrecognizable, the changes will be
<br>
gradual so they will still be, in a sense, the same person.  However I
<br>
think this movie calls that view into question.  Yes, in a sense this
<br>
moment's Leonard is the same person he was an hour ago.  But in another
<br>
sense, he is someone completely different since he knows nothing of his
<br>
earlier mental state.  When we see the situation compressed down to a
<br>
time horizon of a few minutes, it is much more questionable what the
<br>
value is of such an existence.  Yet it is what many of us have planned
<br>
for ourselves.
