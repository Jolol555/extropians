<p><p>Since you mention it, a .223 with SS109/M855 loads and the occasional tracer
<br>
would be nearly ideal -- better penetration than most .30 and a flatter
<br>
trajectory to boot.  Unfortunately, platforms to adequately deliver this
<br>
load are in short supply (and no longer available) in Kalifornia, nevermind
<br>
that tracers are, as has been stated, illegal.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Should we all go and buy gasmasks, or even full biohazard suits?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Full-on suits are very uncomfortable, and you probably won't get the atropine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ampoule and needle included in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price. So much depends on the agent and the dose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If an attack is bio, rather than chem, assuming no open cuts and no direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contact with spores, etc.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your lungs are your first thing to protect, your eyes and mucosa (lips, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the next most important.
</em><br>
<p><p>A gas mask might be useful in a chemical attack (most chemical weapons fall
<br>
like rain and leave shadows), where inhalation is the most significant
<br>
threat, particularly if you aren't standing underneath the cloud or are
<br>
inside a closed building.  The &quot;nice&quot; thing about chemical weapons is that
<br>
they are fairly predictable in this fashion.  A gas mask can also
<br>
substantially reduce exposure to bio-warfare agents.
<br>
<p>A bio suit is substantially less useful.  If you aren't wearing it when the
<br>
attack hits, you might as well not have it for most purposes because you'll
<br>
survive without it if you are smart.  The risk reduction offered by this is
<br>
quite small compared to the risk reduction a gas mask might offer.
<br>
<p>But even without a gas mask, knowledgeable individuals know how to get by
<br>
with fair odds.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There are lots of OSHA style respirators that might provide some protection.
</em><br>
<p><p>Absolutely.  Some OSHA respirators arguably offer better protection than
<br>
many gas masks.  And unlike a dusty old gas mask, the OSHA respirators are
<br>
put to the test regularly under conditions where liability for the
<br>
manufacturer is high.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And walking around in such garb with a rifle slung over my shoulder could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; give people reason to panic...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is true; this is today. Consider:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much can you pack in a gym bag? How often can you practice donning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assembling, loading and taking aim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are the odds you'll be effective?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are the odds you'll be braced as a potential crazy by the gendarmes?
</em><br>
<p><p>Yeah.  Buying a bunch of neat-o toys at the local REI, military surplus, and
<br>
gun store won't do you much good if you have no experience using all your
<br>
stuff when it counts.  It is like all the Abercrombies that get pulled out
<br>
of the woods every year:  All the latest gizmos and gadgets but not the
<br>
slightest bit of experience at using them (or anything else), and not the
<br>
common sense to actually bring someone along that *does* know what they are
<br>
doing so they can learn.  Gadgets don't equal ability, but people often fool
<br>
themselves into thinking that way because laziness is seductive.
