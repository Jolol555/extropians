</em><br>
<p>Thanks Barbara, and I also grieve with you. This is exactly what
<br>
happened with my mother, two years of gradually going away followed by
<br>
a fast fall.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I fear our society is riddled with insane beliefs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will impede progress. ... About a year ago, I tentatively mentioned the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of cryonics to my mother. ... going against God's will.
</em><br>
<p>This is unfortunately the reaction of most people to cryonics and
<br>
overcoming &quot;natural&quot; limits in general. At the same time I believe
<br>
there have been Christian thinkers (Theilard?) promoting the idea that
<br>
whatever humans can do with their intelligence (given by God) is also
<br>
God's will. Now if I were a Christian I would certainly subscribe to
<br>
this view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There has been discussion from time to time about whether &quot;Extropianism&quot; is a sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion. While one would certainly not want to encourage unthinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adherence to extropian principles, the fellowship aspects of religion are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somewhat appealing. People seem to have a hard-wired need to belong to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;group.
</em><br>
<p>Well this is a good point. Another thing that pushes people to
<br>
religious thinking is the wish to believe in an afterlife, especially
<br>
strong when a loved one dies. Extropianism as I see it is &quot;only&quot;
<br>
belief in boudless improvement of human condition through science,
<br>
technology and rational thinking, so I do not think it should ever
<br>
evolve in a sort of religion. At the same time there may be religious
<br>
views of the world much more compatible with extropian thinking than
<br>
the conventional Christian view (Theilard again, omega point theories,
<br>
...).
