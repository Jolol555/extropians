I would like to agree with Robert on this one, but I tend to think Anders is right.  We may end up living in a &quot;botched future&quot; if the challenge is not met.  Sort of, but not really, the 2020 or 2030 we always dreamed of.

Yes, this is my greatest fear. And the worst thing is that as a transhumanist I can't help but feel responsible for what world I create. It would be so cozy to be able to sit and say that the state of the world is everybody else's fault, but in the end I can't do that. The world is ours to shape, and we better shape up.

<p>I liked how Anders summed up such an excellent and insightful post.  When the Progress Action Coalition handbook is written this should be in it.  I would ask E. Shaun and Max to consider this post for the best of the month award.
<br>
<p>I hope his words and this post are not forgotten by the people on the list.  A year or so from now we should review how progess has been made in the ways Anders post would suggest doing.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
