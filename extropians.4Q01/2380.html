<em>&gt; By &quot;punitive destruction&quot; do you mean &quot;coercion?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think coercion per se is the problem.  It's initiation of coercion.
<br>
Coercion in reaction to such initiations -- as retaliation or
<br>
self-defense -- will probably always be needed, but the thing to rule out is
<br>
its initiation [in society] as much as possible.  This way, people can deal
<br>
with each other through reason or not at all.  The person who first resorts
<br>
to coercion is the threat to such a society -- in fact, to civilized
<br>
relations in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Politicians are playing inside a coercive system by definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and it's very unlikely they will change its coercive aspects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it is open to you to be a politician .... if you don't like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current ones, why not compete for their positions?
</em><br>
<p>This is kind of like saying if you don't like the way the slaves are
<br>
treated, don't free them, just become a slave master yourself and treat them
<br>
better.  If you're trying to eliminate slavery, this is probably not the way
<br>
to go about it.
<br>
<p>Also, the problem with democratic governments -- and I mean &quot;republics&quot; too,
<br>
since their ultimate power rests in the democratic election of their key
<br>
leaders -- is that the overall systematic tendency is to promote politicians
<br>
who cater to whatever the majority or powerful minorities want.  This is why
<br>
libertarians, in general, have failed to capture those offices.  (Of course,
<br>
this is part of a deeper problem.  The culture itself in democracies
<br>
generally is antifreedom and antireason.  This, in part, causes the kind of
<br>
statism we see and is caused by it -- e.g., through public schooling,
<br>
corporate and individual welfare, regulation of social relations, taxation
<br>
and other property seizures.)
<br>
<p>Economically, this creates a culture where people see politicians as
<br>
offering wealth to them.  The politicians which maximize shortrun wealth
<br>
transfer generally get the most votes.  (Why short run?  Well, since
<br>
democratically elected officials are generally in office only for a short
<br>
period and do not own their office or the government, they have little
<br>
incentive to think beyond their term AND a very strong incentive to maximize
<br>
current transfers lest another politician push them out and do it for them.)
<br>
<p>Finally, in most democratic systems, it's very hard to change the whole
<br>
system by being elected to one office.  Unlike a monarchy, e.g., there are
<br>
usually many key positions of power, none of which by itself can do a whole
<br>
lot.  Thus, the Prime Minister in Britain can always be thrown out if
<br>
Parliament doesn't agree with him or her.  You'd have to control a big
<br>
portion of Parliament too.  In the US, the same thing applies.  You need
<br>
sizeable portions of both Houses of Congress to really control the Federal
<br>
government -- plus probably friends in the Supreme Court so as not to have
<br>
any legislative actions annulled.  (This should not be taken to mean running
<br>
for office or even using the courts can't be seen as a self-defense action,
<br>
BUT we must realize the limitations of using the system against itself.  It
<br>
doesn't stay in place because it has no &quot;immune&quot; system.)
<br>
<p>If you want a culture based on reason and freedom -- they go together --
<br>
then you have to work on ways to change this.  I think this will be the best
<br>
way to insure technological progress and to make sure such progress is in
<br>
directions that are productive.  This means I think this will be the best
<br>
way to assure an Extropian future.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
