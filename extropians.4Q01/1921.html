<p><p>Where it gets fuzzy here is that you CAN sample individual notes and sounds
<br>
and use them as the basis for a sampled instrument and still have it
<br>
considered &quot;fair use&quot;.  The problem is that while sampling tiny bit of audio
<br>
such as a drum hit or horn stab for use in a completely different context is
<br>
legal, at some point a sound becomes sufficiently complex that it is
<br>
identifiable with the source and therefore no longer &quot;fair use&quot;.  The
<br>
problem is with the definition of &quot;identifiable&quot;, which can be molded to
<br>
suit the aims of the individual or corporation.  An audiophile can
<br>
semi-regularly identify the source of even mangled samples from some other
<br>
source that he is familiar with (being able to fingerprint the character of
<br>
a single note), whereas most people have a hard time identifying one note
<br>
samples.  Record companies regularly argue that single note samples, even
<br>
with additional processing that obscures its origin pretty thoroughly, are
<br>
derivative works that violate their copyrights.  Sometimes they win,
<br>
sometimes they lose, but what is allowed is by no means clear.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, the manufacturers of sample based instruments don't care if
<br>
you sample their audio ROMs and sounds for your own commercial purposes.
<br>
Even though core sample libraries are considered extremely valuable
<br>
property, they are really only valuable as a raw material for building a
<br>
sophisticated system.  The logic behind this attitude is that any simple
<br>
usage of their sample libraries will give mediocre results compared to their
<br>
integrated systems, while producing any really competent copy of their
<br>
system would be far more expensive than just buying the real thing.  In the
<br>
end, the net effect of instrument copying (which does happen) is free
<br>
advertising for the maker of the original instrument.  People who like
<br>
samples of a particularly machine will frequently end up buying that machine
<br>
if the sounds have sufficient value to them.  Otherwise, they may continue
<br>
to use a few samples they purchased from a third party, but they wouldn't
<br>
have bought that machine themselves anyway.  I personally have bought
<br>
musical instruments based on an individual sample that I heard somewhere in
<br>
the sample library of someone who didn't find the instrument particularly
<br>
valuable.  This is at least one example of an industry where very lax
<br>
enforcement of copyrights hasn't hurt anyone and arguably benefited a lot of
<br>
people.
