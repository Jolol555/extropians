Stumped by Rubik's Cube? Let the Lego Robot Solve It
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/11/technology/circuits/11RUBI.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/11/technology/circuits/11RUBI.html</a>
<br>
<p>LEGO bricks bring to mind rudimentary cars and houses snapped together by
<br>
children. But a 37-year-old hobbyist has added a twist, literally, to
<br>
building-block construction: he has created a Lego robot that solves Rubik's
<br>
Cube.
<br>
<p>The hobbyist, Jonathan P. Brown, built the device from Lego's popular
<br>
MindStorms series of robot components, which include microprocessors and
<br>
motors as well as plastic bricks.
<br>
<p>The robot, which is about 14 inches long, 4 inches wide and 8 inches high,
<br>
grasps an arbitrarily shuffled Rubik's Cube. A digital camera scans the cube's
<br>
six faces and then sends the images to an attached PC, which analyzes them and
<br>
sends the robot commands for manipulating the cube. Solving the puzzle takes
<br>
about 15 minutes.
<br>
<p>Although simple in concept, the machine overcomes complex mechanical and
<br>
technical obstacles. &quot;It's an exceptionally well- crafted combination of
<br>
solutions,&quot; said Michael Andersen, a software engineer in Lego's MindStorms
<br>
division.
<br>
<p>The machine, which Mr. Brown calls the Cube Solver, is composed of more than
<br>
1,100 Lego pieces. The Lego Cam reads the Rubik's Cube's faces and relays the
<br>
data through a U.S.B. cable to the PC, which runs color-recognition software
<br>
to determine the configuration and generates the shortest string of moves to
<br>
solve the puzzle (20 moves on average).
<br>
<p>Using an infrared transmitter, the PC communicates with two RCX
<br>
microcomputers, the programmable component of MindStorms. The RCX's control
<br>
the motors of three grippers that hold the cube and twist it to realign the
<br>
faces until every one is made up of squares of the same color.
<br>
<p>Mr. Brown, who is from Britain, lives with his wife and 5-year-old son in
<br>
Chicago and works as a consultant on air-conditioning systems for historic
<br>
buildings. He bought his first MindStorms set, a toy designed mainly for
<br>
teenagers, at the suggestion of a friend's 10-year-old son two years ago.
<br>
Within a year he had become an expert builder, creating complex robots and
<br>
moderating forums on the Lego Web site.
<br>
<p>When Mr. Brown spotted an unsolved Rubik's Cube in a neighbor's apartment last
<br>
year, he wondered if he could devise a robot that would solve the puzzle.
<br>
<p>While many people have written software programs that can represent and solve
<br>
a virtual Rubik's Cube, Mr. Brown set out to build a machine that would use
<br>
such a program to solve an actual cube on its own.
<br>
<p>Right away, he realized that the challenge would lie in building a Lego robot
<br>
precise enough to twist a cube accurately yet strong enough to do so without
<br>
deforming itself.
<br>
<p>&quot;The hardest part was getting the movement combined with the strength,&quot; Mr.
<br>
Brown said. &quot;If you have enough torque to turn the faces, the Lego will bend
<br>
slightly.&quot;
<br>
<p>A cube's joints are resistant enough to push hollow Lego bricks out of shape,
<br>
making the bricks unfit for the relatively delicate task of aligning a cube's
<br>
faces.
<br>
<p>Mr. Brown started with the Rubik's cube itself. To make its stiff joints more
<br>
supple, he applied silicone spray. The mechanism was still too sticky, so he
<br>
wedged plastic knives between the layers of the cube and left it overnight.
<br>
Success.
<br>
<p>He then struggled to build a robot with adequate torque, with grippers that
<br>
would keep the cube from slipping and with drive trains that could rotate the
<br>
faces precisely. The process involved lots of trial and error, and some clever
<br>
solutions. At the suggestion of another Lego enthusiast, Mr. Brown cut shims
<br>
out of the plastic insert tray from a Lego package and inserted them to keep
<br>
some screws snug.
<br>
<p>It took him months to create a prototype of the mechanical system and to adapt
<br>
freely available software source code for solving the puzzle. At this point of
<br>
the project, a person had to type an unsolved cube's random face positions
<br>
into the PC, a project that Mr. Brown considered tedious and prone to error.
<br>
&quot;Imagine dialing a three-dimensional, 54-digit telephone number and you get
<br>
the idea,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>So he set about programming color-recognition software that would read the
<br>
cube automatically and announced on a MindStorms forum that it would be ready
<br>
within a week or so. It took three months. &quot;I thought for sure there'd be
<br>
pre-existing color-recognition software,&quot; Mr. Brown said. &quot;But there just
<br>
isn't.&quot;
<br>
<p>He could have used a more sophisticated camera, but he wanted an all-Lego
<br>
system. &quot;The Lego Cam I was using is a perfectly adequate little Web cam that
<br>
was never meant for this more industrial application,&quot; Mr. Brown said. After
<br>
spending hours at the University of Chicago's science library and much of the
<br>
summer developing a program that would consistently analyze the faces, he
<br>
achieved 95 percent accuracy. By July, he had a final version of the Cube
<br>
Solver.
<br>
<p>While observers tend to explain the contraption in terms of its technical
<br>
proficiency, Mr. Brown correlates its complexity with his own frustration
<br>
level.
<br>
<p>&quot;With any Lego project, you hit a wall where you get frustrated and leave the
<br>
pieces scattered all over the floor while you go away and think about it,&quot; he
<br>
said. &quot;Then you come back and tidy up and start back in. Most projects take
<br>
about four tidies.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Cube Solver took 20.

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
