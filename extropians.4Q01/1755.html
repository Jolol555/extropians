raper of them all, was coming over to me and he was mean 'n' ugly 'n'

nasty 'n' horrible and all kind of things and he sat down next to me

and said, &quot;Kid, whad'ya get?&quot;  I said, &quot;I didn't get nothing, I had to

pay $50 and pick up the garbage.&quot;  He said, &quot;What were you arrested

on the bench there, and the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean nasty

things that we was talking about on the bench.&quot;
