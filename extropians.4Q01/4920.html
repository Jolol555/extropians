<p><p>&lt;&lt;See also <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/prices.htm">http://www.wtrg.com/prices.htm</a> , which doesn't show the kind of
<br>
correlation you're talking about.  During much of the 1980s, crude oil
<br>
prices were well above current prices, yet, by most lights, these were
<br>
boom times.  I also think the oil shortage of the 1970s did have an
<br>
economic economic, but the inflation of the same period was much more
<br>
significant and not driven by oil prices, but instead by the US going
<br>
off the gold standard and the using inflation to monetize government
<br>
debt.  (I'm not a gold bug here.  I don't the gold standard is a cure
<br>
all for banking ills.  If a central bank remains in place, a lot of the
<br>
same problems will play out, gold or no.  See Kevin Dowd's
<br>
_Laissez-Faire Banking_ and many of his other works on banking.)&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I believe you have a persuasive, argument there. My only contention was that 
<br>
during the 80's the general citizenry was aware of the previous 2 oil shocks 
<br>
from OPEC, and was better prepared psychologically to deal with it. The 
<br>
generation that spent their childhood in the 1980's rather then the 70's are 
<br>
less focused on energy as an economic issue, rather then a purely, 
<br>
environmental issue. I would contant this has some impact on such things as 
<br>
panic buying, and irrationality of the marketplace, discussed in our previous 
<br>
posts. On the evening of 9-11, gasoline was selling to record crowds for 5.00 
<br>
per gallon at some fuel stations in Ohio. Up the road it was going for 1.49 a 
<br>
gallon, and stayed at that price before slowly falling.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;That might have been his rhetoric, but actual Fed and international
<br>
monetary policy (often led by the Fed) was inflationary and risk
<br>
externalizing -- allowing risk takers to pass risk along.  Examples of
<br>
the former include the lowering of interests from 1996 until 2000.
<br>
Examples of the latter include the repeated instance of government
<br>
funded or arranged bailouts -- in Mexico, Asia, Russia, and of Long Term
<br>
Capital Management.  Such bailouts pass the buck on risk taking.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Argentina is now facing such decisions now and if they follow the Russion 
<br>
1998 model, their economy should recover, by doing something that 
<br>
international trade advocates would demurr--buying and selling domestic 
<br>
products and services. Because thet now do this, rather then rely on 
<br>
international trade to revive their economy, the Russians are experiencing a 
<br>
double-digit growth spurt.
