<em>&gt; I usually find Chomsky at least worth listening to when I see him on some

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's an anarchosocialist, which makes it funny that Dees and Lorrey should

<em>&gt; Then again, plenty of people criticize _The Bell Curve_ when they haven't ever

</em><br>
<p>Well, I have read a number of essays and speeches he's given, which
<br>
invariably are variations on the theme of &quot;The
<br>
US/Americans/capitalists/libertarians are always wrong because of x, y,
<br>
and z&quot; where x,y, and z are generally a laundry list of events and/or
<br>
assumptions that have been put through the propaganda gristmill to such
<br>
an extent that they bear no relation to actual events or science, while
<br>
at the same time, he excuses the far more heinous acts of others simply
<br>
because they are not Americans/capitalists/libertarians, etc with his
<br>
patent pending rhetoric of moral equivalence, somewhere along the lines
<br>
of &quot;He beat you to death? Well, you deserve it because you once
<br>
embarrassed him.&quot;
<br>
<p>He presents his arguments in such a measured, well paced way that those
<br>
who are predisposed to agree with his conclusions fail to cross examine
<br>
his premises.
