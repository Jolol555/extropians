-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
<br>
<p>Civilization has its golden ages and its dark ages. I'm not saying
<br>
that the present conflict marks the beginning of a spiral into the
<br>
next Dark Ages. We might even be lucky and manage to escape the planet
<br>
and/or the constraints of our current biology without any intervening
<br>
Dark Ages at all. However, in case we're not lucky, perhaps we should
<br>
work out a contingency plan ahead of time. Some way to jump-start
<br>
civilization if it stalls out on us, a la Canticle for Leibowitz and
<br>
the Foundation series.
<br>
<p>Let's develop an 'Extropian Fire Drill' where each of us knows &quot;If my
<br>
Dark Ages alarm is triggered, I will get into my car and drive to
<br>
Nowheresville where I will meet up with Joe, Mary, and Bob to the
<br>
extent that their respective Dark Ages alarms are triggered.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Extropian Fire Drill needs to be developed with the following
<br>
principles in mind:
<br>
<p>1. Most of us are not full-time hardcore survivalists. We have jobs,
<br>
families, school, etc. The evacuation plans must be simple and present
<br>
minimal disruption to the participants' lifestyles and finances.
<br>
<p>2. The evacuation plans must be distributed, decentralized, and
<br>
diverse. Multiple autonomous groups, multiple philosophies and
<br>
organizing principles, as decided upon by the participants of each
<br>
individual group. No messianic leader to tell you where *the* promised
<br>
land is. You just go to *a* promising-looking land you've agreed upon
<br>
with your friends ahead of time.
<br>
<p>3. We're not talking about all-out nuclear winter here! Far more
<br>
likely is the collapse of the global economy, communications
<br>
infrastructure, and rational, secular, civil society. That is easier
<br>
to prepare for, since you can assume able-bodied adults living in an
<br>
area with sufficient resources will be able to fulfill their basic
<br>
needs. That means more attention can be devoted to preservation of
<br>
memes and rebuilding of society (perhaps in a more Extropic image this
<br>
time around ;-).
<br>
<p>4. That being said, locations should be chosen such that they are in
<br>
fact in areas with adequate farmland and a local supply of drinking
<br>
water, a day's or so drive from where most of the participants
<br>
live. They also need to be far from potential military and economic
<br>
targets and have low populations.
<br>
<p>5. The effort should be capable of scaling to an arbitrary number of
<br>
participants, but should have a fair chance of succeeding with only a
<br>
dozen or so.
<br>
<p>6. The planning and practice should be pleasure as much as it is
<br>
business. What if the next Extro or Foresight Gathering were to be
<br>
held in some little town in the middle of farm country, and some of
<br>
the side activities amounted to a dry run of the Extropian Fire Drill?
<br>
<p>So, does anybody have any refinements of the above principles or
<br>
additional principles they'd like to add? Any specific logistical
<br>
ideas (locations, packing lists)? Anybody interested in starting an
<br>
Extropian Fire Drill Club in Texas?
<br>
<p>Another issue that needs to be discussed is what constitutes a good
<br>
trigger event for a Dark Ages alarm. It should be sensitive enough
<br>
that you have a few days lead time to get out before everybody else
<br>
sees the CNN headlines and chokes up the roads. Yet it should not be
<br>
so sensitive that it is either at risk for false or premature
<br>
positives. Don't want to waste your sickleave days for nothing, after
<br>
all! Obviously it would be up to each participant to decide what their
<br>
triggering events are, and I'm asking this so I can get some ideas on
<br>
what to use as my own triggering events. Perhaps an Idea Futures claim
<br>
that bases its values on a collection of political and socioeconomic
<br>
FX claims?
<br>
<p>Look forward to your opinions. I hope this turns into something we are
<br>
capable of doing at any moment, and never have to actually do.
<br>
