<p>I am out of here.  I have had it with the endless war-mongering,
<br>
the near total lack of knowledge of history and world situations
<br>
and most of all with the lack of almost any compassion or
<br>
understanding of other people.  I believe there are a lot more
<br>
fruitful places to contribute to the world I would like to see
<br>
flower.
<br>
<p>peace and the best of luck,
