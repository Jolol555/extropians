<br>
<p><p>[Posted November 5, 2001]
<br>
<p>Sometime during the 1970s I was closely associated with the University of
<br>
California-Santa Barbara's Department of Philosophy, struggling to develop
<br>
and explore my classical liberal, libertarian, and Objectivist (or
<br>
neo-Aristotelian) ideas and gain for them some respect among the faculty and
<br>
students. I had very limited success--indeed, may be said to have been
<br>
failing--until something rather comic happened.
<br>
<p>The department had invited Professor Antony Flew to give a paper, and we all
<br>
gathered on a Friday afternoon to wait for him from the airport. He arrived
<br>
on time and was being ushered into the reception room where a sort of
<br>
welcoming line was formed, with all of us standing in anticipation.
<br>
<p>Professor Flew was by then a very accomplished analytic philosopher, a Hume
<br>
scholar, and the editor of several volumes on various aspects of analytic
<br>
philosophy. He was, let's say, a legend in his own time. As Professor Flew
<br>
appeared at the door, welcomed by the various faculty members, he stopped
<br>
and, raising his voice, aired the following question, roughly, addressed to
<br>
no one in particular:  &quot;Where is Tibor Machan? Does he not do graduate work
<br>
here?&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, my not being the star of the department's student body, Professor
<br>
Flew's question was met with skepticism and puzzlement. Why would he want to
<br>
know about this renegade person, something of a nuisance during those
<br>
heydays of the New Left and various fashionable statist doctrines?
<br>
<p>It turned out, if my memory serves me right, that Professor Flew had by then
<br>
discovered Reason Magazine, which I had helped launch in Santa Barbara in
<br>
1969. And from its pages he must have learned that there was this
<br>
libertarian at UCSB's philosophy department, and he wanted to know a bit
<br>
about him.
<br>
<p><p><p>While the episode was mainly of personal significance to me, an aspect of it
<br>
has some broader lessons to teach us. It took this kind of &quot;merit by
<br>
association&quot; to give at least a slight boost to my own career in its very
<br>
early stages. Henceforth none of the folks at UCSB's department of
<br>
philosophy could dismiss my politics as cavalierly as they had up to that
<br>
point.
<br>
<p>In this way the episode forecast a more important advance in the modern
<br>
classical liberal movement, namely, Nozick's publication, while he was a
<br>
young professor in Harvard's Department of Philosophy, of Anarchy, State,
<br>
and Utopia, which gave the more widespread impetus to the legitimization of
<br>
libertarian in academic political philosophy and theory. Nozick's book was
<br>
an intellectual virtuosity, there's no doubt about that, but it is
<br>
questionable whether without his Princeton/Harvard pedigree it would have
<br>
made the impact it did.
<br>
<p>As Thomas S. Kuhn suggested, in his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
<br>
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962), which launched the concept of
<br>
&quot;paradigm&quot; on its very successful career as a buzzword, only when a basic
<br>
idea gains social acceptance as a problem solver do folks in a discipline
<br>
begin to pay attention to it. This may not speak all that well of many in
<br>
the disciplines involved, but it does often help get a position over a
<br>
crucial hump, as Nozick did with libertarianism.
<br>
<p>In the tradition of liberal education the ideal is for the academy to devote
<br>
itself to both the education of young scholars and the investigation of the
<br>
facts and theories of the various disciplines. This is perhaps one of the
<br>
reasons for the application of the standard of publishing or perishing at
<br>
most higher educational institutions--those who teach need to keep abreast
<br>
of their discipline, and being involved in research and scholarship is
<br>
surely one good way of doing this.
<br>
<p>As with all human institutions, corruption is always a possibility, and so
<br>
many institutions of higher education can become sectarian and monolithic,
<br>
not to mention homes to what is not very charitably referred to as deadbeat
<br>
scholars who, usually once they have achieved tenure, no longer take part in
<br>
the conversations of their fields. Institutions may, of course, make valiant
<br>
or perfunctory efforts to discourage this, and we are familiar enough with
<br>
all these at various colleges and universities. Keeping someone at the
<br>
assistant or associate professorship level for decades on end, with no or
<br>
merely token increases in compensation, is just one such effort. Ostracism
<br>
and criticism are others.
<br>
<p>Institutions, of course, may themselves be so structured as to encourage or
<br>
discourage conscientiousness, and this is so with higher education. I want
<br>
to argue that having higher education managed, ultimately, by the state is
<br>
one of the most corrupting aspects we find in these institutions. And one of
<br>
most obvious casualties of this corruption is the neglect of serious studies
<br>
of a private education alternative in higher education, along with all of
<br>
the adjacent inquiries that might focus on the pros and cons of what we
<br>
might call the voluntary or fully free society.
<br>
<p>Now it is not easy to measure just how an institution might have fared apart
<br>
from being associated with the government. Frederick Bastiat's famous
<br>
insight about what is seen and what is not seen comes to mind immediately,
<br>
as one considers why such measurement is difficult. If the state provides
<br>
what is euphemistically called free education--and given that people will
<br>
generally be reluctant to refuse to take advantage of what does not appear
<br>
to them to be costing them anything in favor of purchasing what they take to
<br>
be the same service--it is difficult to imagine a plethora of fully private
<br>
higher educational institutions in a society in which government is
<br>
collecting and spending confiscated resources on the same.
<br>
<p>So comparative studies are nearly impossible in such cases--even those
<br>
colleges and universities that are labeled &quot;private&quot; receive extensive
<br>
funding from the government and inadvertently model themselves on the
<br>
government's version of higher education. True diversity, experimentation,
<br>
and such isn't very reasonable to expect under such circumstances.
<br>
<p>Yet it is not all that difficult to judge the matter via thought
<br>
experimentation. Consider, in this connection, the readiness with which
<br>
studies funded by private industry are often indicted merely because the
<br>
funding may induce some to skew their findings. If the tobacco industry
<br>
funds a study on nicotine addiction or the impact of advertising on the
<br>
young, it will readily be criticized for being completely unreliable, never
<br>
mind the specific techniques deployed in the study. (One paradox is that, of
<br>
course, those who aren't connected to the industry tend not to know a whole
<br>
lot about what is supposed to be researched in the first place.)
<br>
<p>It is more rare to find criticisms of scientific or scholarly work performed
<br>
at government-funded universities. In fact, the overwhelming majority of
<br>
political scientists, historians, political philosophers, and others dealing
<br>
with the study of human community life fully or largely acquiesce to the
<br>
statist position in nearly all aspects of their work. The exception is when
<br>
it comes to attempts at direct control of what they themselves are
<br>
saying--akin to the way the press tends to favor government solutions other
<br>
than when it comes to cleaning up its own act, in which case it vigorously
<br>
invokes the First Amendment to fend off the state.
<br>
<p>**********
<br>
<p>Yet it is rarely suggested that all the government funding of research and
<br>
scholarship may well have a corrupting affect on these endeavors. Recently,
<br>
several philosophers--among them most notably Peter Singer--refused to even
<br>
attend conferences on environmental issues sponsored by Shell Oil
<br>
Corporation on the expressed ground that doing so would contribute to the
<br>
corruption of the disciplines being considered at the conference. Yet
<br>
thousands of scholars every year take part in government-funded NEH and
<br>
similarly government-sponsored seminars, and thousands more take money from
<br>
government to help them write their books and do their research. I have yet
<br>
to hear the same complaint from the folks so concerned about
<br>
industry-sponsored work about government-funded work.
<br>
<p>Yet surely the state, given its far greater power and lack of competition,
<br>
is a more serious threat to scholarly and scientific objectivity and
<br>
nonpartisanship than are private firms that must always be careful that the
<br>
work of other, competing firms will attract great respect and
<br>
trustworthiness and, thus, profits.
<br>
<p>**********
<br>
<p>There is no serious doubt in my mind that what I have related above
<br>
accounts, in significant measure, for the absence of a serious contingent of
<br>
classical liberal and libertarian scholars through Western higher education,
<br>
except in the field of economics, where the ideas of classical liberalism
<br>
are well nigh a defining element of the discipline itself. Trade or economic
<br>
exchange is, after all, impossible without the freedom to come to mutually
<br>
agreeable terms, so economists are, as some of their critics from the Left
<br>
rightfully point out, necessarily working within the classical liberal
<br>
framework or, if you will, paradigm.
<br>
<p>In my own case, I can give you three telling stories. Around 1984 or so I
<br>
applied for a Congressional Fellowship, which would have involved working in
<br>
the office some member of Congress and contributing to the discussion of the
<br>
various measures on which he or she was considering a vote. I made it to the
<br>
short list and was flown to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore where the
<br>
final interviews were being held. When my turn came, the very first question
<br>
the head of the committee conducting the interviews asked me was: &quot;How could
<br>
you, one who considers libertarianism sound, ever advise anyone in
<br>
Congress?&quot;  I answered, &quot;Well, I could ask whether the measure pertained to
<br>
what the role of government is supposed to be in a free society.&quot;  Needless
<br>
to say, I was not selected.
<br>
<p>On another occasion I recommended a project to one of the grant-giving
<br>
bodies in Washington, suggesting that I investigate the proper scope of
<br>
public authority, with an emphasis on an analysis of the concept of &quot;the
<br>
public&quot; in a free society. It came to light, after my proposal was rejected,
<br>
that several of the panelists found this line of enquiry--not, mind you, my
<br>
methodology or scope of research or scholarship--infelicitous because it
<br>
would not likely contribute to proactive government proposals.
<br>
<p>Finally, in 1987, Sidney Hook and I made a pilot for a proposed PBS series
<br>
on political philosophy, &quot;For the Love of Work,&quot; featuring the ideas of Karl
<br>
Marx. This received enthusiastic endorsements from a wide variety of
<br>
scholars, by no means all of the classical liberals, and was nevertheless
<br>
turned down. The Wall Street Journal did some digging and discovered that
<br>
one panelist voted against it on the expressed grounds that the program
<br>
proposed to feature as its host a &quot;mere popularizer of libertarianism.&quot;
<br>
<p>That I had by then published in several major philosophy journals and law
<br>
reviews was cast aside in the decision process of this panelist and, I can
<br>
only surmise, in that of most of the others.
<br>
<p>My claim is by no means that everyone must get corrupted in a
<br>
government-funded college or university. But I would maintain that unless
<br>
one is rather strict with oneself and keeps the issue in the forefront of
<br>
his or her mind, such corruption is very likely to creep into one's academic
<br>
work, if only by making sure that one does not touch on sensitive topics,
<br>
ones that may offend the authorities who distribute the resources taken from
<br>
the citizenry.
<br>
<p>Why, one can ask, would such folks fund work that undermines their own
<br>
dedicated service, one that presupposes the aggressively proactive state?
<br>
It would not be reasonable, would it? This leaves us with a problem: how to
<br>
extricate higher--indeed, all--education from the clutches of government?
<br>
In semi-democracies such as we have in most Western societies, in order to
<br>
effectuate change without out-and-out violent revolution, it is necessary to
<br>
gain the support of those who are primarily concerned with an area of study
<br>
and practice.
<br>
<p>But the state has a monopoly on higher education, and those who work for it
<br>
tend, in part accordingly, to favor the state in most every respect. How can
<br>
their support be obtained? The good news is that even the state can go
<br>
bankrupt, in more ways than one, including intellectually. And there is
<br>
plenty of evidence that statism itself is now on the verge of bankruptcy.
<br>
Not only because its most explicit forms have been discredited in the minds
<br>
of many citizens, but also because any honest investigation of the arguments
<br>
made in favor of statism has to conclude that these arguments are tepid,
<br>
desperate, and merely repeat the lame dogmas of the past.
<br>
<p>Thus the minority but growing number of dedicated students and, often,
<br>
champions of the free society may yet have a chance to turn people's minds,
<br>
especially those of the next generation seeking fresh solutions to the
<br>
problems of community life. This, at least, is my hope.
<br>
<p>But complacency is a big obstacle to progress, as is the more understandable
<br>
fact that many people, among them a great many intellectuals, are dreamers
<br>
and believe that against all odds they can eat cakes and have them, can
<br>
square circles, can reach the impossible dream.
<br>
<p>This is understandable because in some cases believing along these lines can
<br>
be the way to make important breakthroughs. Yet just as breakthroughs must
<br>
be made without abandoning good ideas already developed, so it is vital that
<br>
whatever political experimentation seems appealing not be done at the
<br>
expense of values we know well enough to be confident about. And because no
<br>
guarantee exists against this temptation, libertarians must recognize that
<br>
their vision is a possibility but by no means some guaranteed future.
