</em><br>
<p>Anything that looks remotely 'military' is generally considered a 'bad
<br>
gun' in Taxifornia, but there is a list of various 'assault' features,
<br>
and any rifle must have three or less of these to be legal, unless they
<br>
were sold to the public prior to a particular date . For example, you
<br>
don't need a bayonet lug to defend against a crop duster (unless he is
<br>
flying REALLY low ;P)
<br>
<p>Actually, if you wanna do well with a truly legal gun, you can't go
<br>
wrong with a ten guage shotgun chambered for a 3.5 inch magnum shell.
<br>
Mossberg makes these relatively cheaply, in pump and semi-auto versions,
<br>
with rifled barrels no less. They can be used for turkey or high flying
<br>
goose hunting. If you can hit a goose with a ten guage (which is the
<br>
standard), you should be able to hit a crop duster with it. Use magnum
<br>
loads with double ought buckshot. 
<br>
<p>You can also get the barrel of the ten guage with adjustable chokes. The
<br>
choke is the area at the muzzle of the barrel, which provides some
<br>
degree of constriction to help provide the desired pattern of shot. Full
<br>
choke provides the tightest pattern of shot, which you would use for the
<br>
longest range shots.
<br>
<p>I've seen guys take down Canada geese flying so high they were just
<br>
specks in the air with a magnum chambered ten guage shotgun.
<br>
<p>At several hundred yards, you should have a shot pattern a couple feet
<br>
across with each shot. A couple of those shots should do some definite
<br>
damage to a crop duster... it doesn't matter, see, that the shot is
<br>
moving very fast when it hits the plane. The plane is already moving
<br>
really fast, so it does its own damage by hitting the shot, even if the
<br>
shot is simply grabbing hang time at the top of its arc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I took a ride over to the local sporting goods store today and found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I can get a cheapy 30 aught six for about 250 bucks.  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of WW2 vintage weapons available there for about 100, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look like they would serve this application perfectly.  I didnt pick one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out.  I still wanna see if I can find tracers.
</em><br>
<p>Tracers are decent. You might also look into other ammo, like exploding
<br>
rounds, smoke rounds, etc. There are also various types of tracer round,
<br>
designed for early and late flaring.
<br>
<p>Now, shooting at planes is nothing new. When I was in the USAF stationed
<br>
in New Mexico, the F-111's I worked on had the number one airframe
<br>
problem being bullet holes from farmers pissed at their cattle being
<br>
spooked by low flying nape of the earth planes.... A rifle shoots a
<br>
single bullet, and most places you shoot at a plane will have little or
<br>
no effect on it. You put a bunch of shot at it, you are more likely to
<br>
cause some damage. The skin of a plane is rather thin, so any bullet is
<br>
not gonna do much expansion as it passes thru. Youv'e gotta hit a hard
<br>
solid metal part, one that performs an essential function, like fuel
<br>
supply, hydraulic power, power generation, controls actuation, or
<br>
propulsion (or the pilot), to cause significant damage.
