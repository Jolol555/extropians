<p><em>    &gt; Tell it to Allende.
</em><br>
<p>I don't give a damn about Allende, especially at a time like now, that was 20 years ago
<br>
and the man was not on the side of the angels. Besides, from about 3000BC major
<br>
powers have used covert actions and other things short of outright war to influence
<br>
unfriendly countries,  things are no different today nor should they be.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;We haven't given a rat's ass for the democratically elected leadership

</em><br>
<p>Samantha has the childish idea that the man on the street is basically wise and
<br>
trustworthy so if something is a democracy it must be a good thing and we should
<br>
support it. Well, I don't want a democracy in Egypt or Saudi Arabia or Pakistan and
<br>
perhaps not even in Iraq because however unsavory the dictators of those countries
<br>
are in a free election they would be replaced by something far worse, religious zealots
<br>
aiming at martyrdom.

<p><em>     &gt;do you think the CIA was prohibited from being in the assasination business
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Fortunately it looks like the CIA will soon get back into the assassination business,
<br>
we all know who number one on the target list will be.
