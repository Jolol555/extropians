<p>It looks like some much hand waving.  If you accept Keen's
<br>
oversimplifications, then some of what he says follows.  For instance, he
<br>
reduces markets to the models Neoclassical economists use.  These models are
<br>
highly abstract and very unrealistic.  The main criticism made of
<br>
Neoclassical economics by Austrian economists is that if their models really
<br>
were the way things are, then there would be no need for change,
<br>
entreprenuership, or any economic activity.  Prices would match costs and
<br>
everything would be in equilibrium.  Since no real world market is this way,
<br>
the thing to do is change the model -- not give up the market.
<br>
<p>This is why he is so surprised, e.g., prices aren't set by firms seeking the
<br>
intersections of supply and demand curves.  Well, the intersection is based
<br>
on a simplified model.  At best, it can be a teaching tool, but since it's
<br>
very hard to figure out what exactly what the demand curve is, especially
<br>
what it is in equilibrium.  Any market price is always a disequilibrium one.
<br>
Generally, a successful entrepreneur will find a price that enough people
<br>
are willing to pay which is above the costs enough to make the effort
<br>
worthwhile.  (In other words, the goal should be to figure out _expected_
<br>
price _first_ -- what people are willing to pay -- then see if one can keep
<br>
costs under that price and, of course, afterwards, whether the expectation
<br>
was correct.  Note: &quot;expected&quot; here means one can't really be sure.  The
<br>
future is unknown.)
<br>
<p>For more on this see &quot;Macroeconomics for the Real World&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Macro.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Macro.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;and the books cited therein, especially Estaben Thomsen's _Prices and
<br>
Knowledge: A Market-Process Perspective_.
<br>
<p>Anyhow, with immediate and obvious problems like the above, I don't want to
<br>
plunk down any money for his book right now.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
