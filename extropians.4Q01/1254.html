<p>Well, the back yard is only .75 acres, and the front yard is a half
<br>
acre, so you've got some calibrating to do. That's the Lebanon house.
<br>
The hunting cabin has a 40,000+ acre back yard (and front yard) where
<br>
the neighbors talk to each other by CB radio. (my handle is &quot;Bullwinkle&quot;
<br>
on channel 14 if you are in the north woods).
<br>
<p>Your back yard is quite quaint, and far better landscaped than either of
<br>
my yards. Your house is really sweet too, far better designed than the
<br>
raised ranch I'm living in now. Right now I'm repainting it (yes it is
<br>
getting colder here) and I'm down to the shutters and the roof trim now.
<br>
The siding is all crappy particle board 1' clapboards, which is a pain
<br>
in the butt to scrape and paint to get a satisfactory result.
