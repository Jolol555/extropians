<em>&gt; Also, I happened to catch part of an interview with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. -- Prince Bandar bin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sultan bin Abdul Aziz on a PBS show last night.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A *very* astute politician.  I suspect he could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beat most U.S. politicians in an election without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breaking a sweat.  He made a *very* interesting point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the al Saud family had been in power for ~300 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is *not* a &quot;politically&quot; incompetent group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My 2c worth for today.

I'm afraid Prince Bandar is pulling your leg. The House of Saud has been
<br>
around for ~300 years but for most of that time they didn't rule anything
<br>
apart from a couple of oases in the Nejd. They only became the rulers of
<br>
what is now Saudi Arabia after the collapse of the Ottoman empire, in about
<br>
1921. Previously, most of that area was ruled by the Hashemite dynasty, in
<br>
their capacity as Sharifs of Mecca (they were basically the local clients of
<br>
the Ottomans). After the Hashemites were thrown out by Ibn Saud they went
<br>
off and became kings of Jordan (still going) and Iraq (until the Baath took
<br>
over). There are plenty of very able people among the 7,000 or so princes
<br>
but that's not the critical variable. What matters is &quot;asibiyah&quot; a word that
<br>
doesn't translate well into english but means something like &quot;group
<br>
solidarity&quot;. If the ruling family loses it they've had it. Typically, once
<br>
an extended clan gets power over an extended territory it only retains that
<br>
solidarity for about a hundred years/three generations. Steve Davies
