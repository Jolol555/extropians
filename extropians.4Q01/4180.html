<em>&gt; Michael - Do you believe that computer programs can be conscious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not clear from your message.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you do, then imagine that you find yourself one day to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program.  Ignore the question of whether you are the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person as some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human precursor, just consider the future.  If the computer is stopped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and re-started, are you the same person?  If your program is copied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another section of memory, are you the same person?  If two copies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your program are made, are they both you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think considering the questions in this way is helpful as it lets us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get past some of our intuitions and prejudices from our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where one body == one mind.  We can think more clearly and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analytically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the problems by considering disembodied consciousness.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That lets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us focus on the role of information and its transfer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal
</em><br>
<p>I always find this metaphor unsatisfying. Particularly because, even though
<br>
I might believe that we could create conscious intelligence from parts,
<br>
those parts might not be in the form of a von-neumann computer. It may be
<br>
the case that there are some quite stringent restrictions on the substrate
<br>
for intelligence+consciousness, including stopping/restarting, wholesale
<br>
copying around in memory (or whatever persistence mechanism was to be used),
<br>
etc. There might be restrictions which entirely preclude running
<br>
consciousness on a suped-up Pentium.
