<em>&gt;From: Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20This%20war%20is%20Not%20about%20Terror,%20But%20about%20Islam&In-Reply-To=&lt;200110101351.GAA00208@well.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;At the least, we better hope it is NOT about Islam. If it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then and if it is public spoken of and fault on that basis then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we have opened the gates of hell.  
</em><br>
<p><p>It is most certainly not about Islam.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I would prefer not to be exploited at all.  And I would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that world powers keep their hands off of my own country in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case.  I would especially prefer they not undermine its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government (if legitimately elected at least) and not bomb its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;territory any time they believe it might be in their interest to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do so without due process.  
</em><br>
<p>This is easy to achieve.
<br>
<p>Simply don't give sanctuary to terrorists who commit acts of war
<br>
against foreign governments.
<br>
<p>There is no due process to acts of war, even the bleeding hearts at
<br>
the U.N. recognize this.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is always ok to criticize.  It is not OK to conflate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actions of some extremist elements with the entire religion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all of its practictioners.  The latter is prejudice and sloppy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(and very dangerous) thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see any reputable person doing any such thing.
