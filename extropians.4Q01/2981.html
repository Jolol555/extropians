<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The above factor has been one the most depressing considerations in my life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the last few years.  I have fantasies that a group of higher
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While some people have manic/depressive moodswings, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimistic/pessimistic mood swings.  Sometimes I think my pessimism is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; name-calling, I doubt we can ever accomplish some of our more advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internal politics seems to be the biggest threat to all our plans.  Even
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I wholeheartedly agree.  The future is something I am passionate
<br>
about creating.  I came here to talk with others about what I
<br>
believe can be done, challenges along the way, the effect of
<br>
current events and attitudes and so on.  Lately I seem to spend
<br>
most of my time fighting off people who wish to attack and
<br>
vilify me personally because they do not agree with my opinions
<br>
and consider my concerns baseless on the post-911 situation. 
<br>
What on earth or beyond it is the point of that?  It is not what
<br>
I am here for.  I am not here to have it assumed I am some evil
<br>
manipulative bitch if I try to express my opinion reasonably
<br>
well.  I am not here to have it assumed I am a member of some
<br>
never-to-be-considered group or other if my opinion does not
<br>
match someone elses on any matter.  And I am most certainly not
<br>
here to be vilified, slandered and silenced by schoolyard
<br>
bullying that has absolutely no place among those who say they
<br>
are for creating a vibrant future.
