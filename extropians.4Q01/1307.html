I see nothing in your reference that disputes my assertion.

<em>&gt; Mike,

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You should do a bit of looking before you assume you know the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story and I am &quot;talking out [my] ear&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Encylopedia.com
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Wahhabi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Wahhabi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Pronounced As: wähäb , reform movement in Islam,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      originating in Arabia. It was founded by Muhammad ibn Abd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      al-Wahab (c.1703-1791), who taught that all accretions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Islam after the 3d cent. of the Muslim era-i.e., after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      c.950-were spurious and must be expunged. This view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      involving essentially a purification of the Sunni sect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      regarded the veneration of saints, ostentation in worship,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      and luxurious living as the chief evils. Accordingly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wahhabi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      mosques are simple and without minarets, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      adherents dress plainly and do not smoke tobacco or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      hashish. Driven from Medina for his preaching, the founder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      of the Wahhabi sect went into the NE Nejd and converted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      the Saud tribe. The Saudi sheik, convinced that it was his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      religious mission to wage holy war (jihad) against all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      forms of Islam, began the conquest of his neighbors in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      c.1763. By 1811 the Wahhabis ruled all Arabia, except
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Yemen, from their capital at Riyadh. The Ottoman sultan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      nominally suzerain over Arabia, had vainly sent out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      expeditions to crush them. Only when the sultan called on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Muhammad Ali of Egypt for aid did he meet success; by 1818
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      the Wahhabis were driven into the desert. In the Nejd they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      collected their power again and from 1821 to 1833 gained
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      control over the Persian Gulf coast of Arabia. The domain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      thereafter steadily weakened; Riyadh was lost in 1884, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      in 1889 the Saud family fled for refuge into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighboring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      state of Kuwait. The Wahhabi movement was to enjoy its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      third triumph when Ibn Saud advanced from his capture of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Riyadh in 1902 to the reconstitution in 1932 of nearly all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      ancestral domain under the name Saudi Arabia, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Wahhabism remains dominant. Wahhabism served as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      inspiration to other Islamic reform movements from India
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      and Sumatra to North Africa and the Sudan.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One again, Samantha talking out her ear. Wahhabism does support war and

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorism as legitimate expressions of Jihad are not Wahhabis.
