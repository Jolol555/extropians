[sigh]
<br>
I really tire of the call to arms and desire to kill all who would oppose 
<br>
&quot;us&quot;. That is not what I see as part of an extropian future. That is simply 
<br>
dropping to the level of the idiots that would push intolerant, radical 
<br>
extremism.
<br>
<p>If we have large-scale intolerance in the world accompanied by retreat to 
<br>
old time values then we extropians lose out big-time. It could delay the 
<br>
spike for decades. :-(
<br>
<p>What causes it? This should be the first question we ask.
<br>
<p>Some would point to Islam, but there are many enlightened moslems, so I 
<br>
don't think that sticks. Some would say poverty, and while I think that is 
<br>
part of it, I don't think that is the whole story. The idiots who murder 
<br>
doctors that perform abortions are not some poverty-stricken 
<br>
third-worlders. However I think poverty does play a large part. I have an 
<br>
extremist christian friend (well, kinda friend until she started seeing me 
<br>
more as the devil's agent). She comes from a rather poor family where the 
<br>
father regularly got drunk and beat the crap out of the mother and kids. I 
<br>
think it was her harsh upbringing that instilled her fervent belief in what 
<br>
amounts to a cruel god. And it is not just religion either. An atheist who 
<br>
grows up under the stick rather than the carrot will likely hold lifelong 
<br>
pessimistic and intolerant views of the human race too.
<br>
<p>I think this is the crux of the matter.
<br>
<p>How in heaven's name do we reverse this? That should be the second question.
<br>
<p>Harsh conditions are very hard to undo. One of our immediate aims should be 
<br>
to do what we can to spread wealth, well-being, and tolerance. I don't just 
<br>
mean by giving all your money away -- that would do little good for anybody 
<br>
at all. I mean use your influence where you can to help raise living 
<br>
conditions for those around you. If you operate a factory then try to 
<br>
ensure the workers don't undergo hardship. If you are a distributor then 
<br>
try to ensure those things help people rather than poison or exploit them. 
<br>
If you are a teacher, try to inspire people to learn and to help others. If 
<br>
you have political influence then try to get leaders to be more tolerant 
<br>
and benevolent.
<br>
<p>The main target should be the next generation. While some good can be done 
<br>
for the current generations, and that will pass on to the next generation, 
<br>
sadly I think adults who have already succumbed to extremist beliefs are 
<br>
largely already lost. The best that can be done is lessen the pressure they 
<br>
place upon their children by improving their living conditions and wealth. 
<br>
That way the next generation have a chance of seeing that there is 
<br>
something more to life.
<br>
<p>Thoughts? Comments?

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
