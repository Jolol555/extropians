&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe at that time the best estimates were that the American 
<br>
casualties in an invasion of the Japanese homeland would run about one 
<br>
million.  The Japanese casualites at that time were supposed to be running 
<br>
about ten to our one.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the gentleman saying we could have conquered the Japanese homeland 
<br>
with a much lower casualty rate on both sides than the one estimated?  If so 
<br>
upon what does he base this estimate?  If not is the gentleman saying that it 
<br>
would have been preferable to have eleven million American and Japanese 
<br>
casualities required if we didn't use the atomic bomb than to have the 
<br>
roughly half million casualties we had with the bomb.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the human level -- we had not attacked the Japanese at Pearl Harbor 
<br>
-- we had entered that war against our will.  I had several Uncles-to-be 
<br>
fighting in that theatre of war -- should I have extended the threat against 
<br>
my Uncle's lives and limbs for even one second if the weapon was available to 
<br>
end the fighting?
<br>
Thank you,
<br>
Ron h.
