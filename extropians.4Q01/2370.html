<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then why not? You complain rather a lot, why not change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yourself first before tackling the rest of the world?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe because it's against my principles. I believe in freedom, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction of the absence of coercion, I believe too in the change, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reprogramming, or if really necessary punitive destruction of coercive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces. 
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;punitive destruction&quot; do you mean &quot;coercion?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Politicians are playing inside a coercive system by definition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it's very unlikely they will change its coercive aspects.
</em><br>
<p>But it is open to you to be a politician .... if you don't like
<br>
the current ones, why not compete for their positions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm so tired of this 'why not change yourself first before tackling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of the world?'. It's not me that have to change on this point 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or I would become an ashole. If I change on this point the world will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I have a constructive program rather than just whinging .....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what is this constructive program ?
</em><br>
<p>Partly in order to gain access to media, and partly with aim of
<br>
building a political coalition to eventually assume power of
<br>
governance .... I have set up the POSTHUMAN ALLIANCE
<br>
as a loosely knit support system to co-ordinate various Trans/ post/
<br>
neohuman/ extropian/ radical futurist groups and individuals who are
<br>
politically active in their own regions/ countries.
<br>
<p>Some pooled literature, media contacts and maybe campaign
<br>
assistance is on offer. 
<br>
<p>I realise that the range of views (from fundamentalist Singularitarians
<br>
to Marilyn Manson &quot;posthumans&quot;) is wide and varied, so have tried to
<br>
identify the basic unifying strands that do exist:
<br>
<p>(1) Social liberalism/ libertarianism
<br>
(2) Support for new scientific research and accelerated
<br>
technological programs (nanotech, nets, genetics, cryonics &amp;c.)
<br>
(3) Acceleration of programs for space colonisation.
<br>
(4) Psychological &quot;reform&quot; ... particularly opposition to human-era
<br>
religions &amp; supernaturalism .... and other regressive forces.
<br>
<p>Do you accept these?

<p><em>&gt; Hi Steve and the rest of you ! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would like to know what your &quot;constructive program&quot; is, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steve. 
</em><br>
<p>SEE ABOVE. I am standing on Posthuman Alliance platform in central
<br>
London &amp; encourage others to do so in their own localities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since you say that humans being are irrational and thus unfit to run 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the planet (are we &quot;running&quot; the planet ?!), what are your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestions ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
We have spent the past 150 years undergoing a &quot;transitional&quot; stage
<br>
and have outgrown the old &quot;Darwinian/ naturally selected&quot; phase of
<br>
our evolution. Some of the &quot;human&quot; legacy conditioning now has to go.
<br>
Some ideas at www.multi.co.uk/identity.htm &amp; www.extropia.net
