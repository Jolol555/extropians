<p>What if you lived in anarchotopia. Some people were better armed than
<br>
others, but there was no real police force. There were arbitration
<br>
agents, and even a half-assed toothless &quot;United Neighbors&quot;
<br>
organization that passed all kinds of resolutions but compliance with
<br>
their rulings was in effect voluntary. There was also a big mean biker
<br>
gang armed with M16's, grenades, and missile launchers. Let's say they
<br>
were called the Yanks. They were the biggest opponents of the commie
<br>
liberals at the United Neighbors organization, denouncing it (rightly)
<br>
as an attempt at world government. Now let's say there's another gang,
<br>
led by one Osama Bin Rotten. They're not yet as well armed but they
<br>
are young, sneaky, hungry, and anxious to see if the Yanks are as
<br>
tough as they pretend to be.
<br>
<p>A major rumble is brewing and you're beginning to worry that in the
<br>
process the whole neighborhood will get burned down.
<br>
<p>How would you propose to resolve this issue without submitting to a
<br>
world government nor a despotism of the Yanks or Bin Rotten?
<br>
<p>Purpose: to take the geopolitical mess and put it in a more familiar
<br>
contex in order to better understand the dilemma of preserving a
<br>
multipolar and autonomous world yet also a peaceful/lawful one.
<br>
