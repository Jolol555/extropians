<p><p>I don't disagree with you at all.  What I was saying is that the core
<br>
technologies are very good, but what is used and how it is used is driven by
<br>
a great many factors that have nothing to do with overall energy efficiency.
<br>
For almost all applications, energy efficiency is traded for other forms of
<br>
utility (cost, shape, size, etc).  It is only in the most extreme (and
<br>
expensive) applications that you see truly efficient energy utilization, and
<br>
even then only because energy efficiency is valued above all other
<br>
properties.
<br>
<p>So yes, we can engineer things with high theoretical efficiency right now,
<br>
but we rarely do because energy efficiency isn't the only thing of value in
<br>
the world.  Energy efficiency IS valued highly (most energy consuming
<br>
devices in the U.S. have very visible energy consumption metrics attached to
<br>
them when you buy them), but not at the expense of every other valuable
<br>
property of the energy consuming device.  For example, you could put a V6
<br>
engine in my big truck and get by for 98% of what I do, but it is that last
<br>
2% that requires 5.8L V8.  The cost of lower energy efficiency for most
<br>
tasks is less than the cost of owning a bunch of specialized vehicles that
<br>
are energy optimized for their specific task.  It is a lot cheaper to own a
<br>
truck that can do everything reasonably well that I would want a truck for
<br>
than to own two or three that are optimized for every task.  Of course,
<br>
nanotech will fix all that.
