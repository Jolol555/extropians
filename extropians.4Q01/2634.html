<em>&gt;Andy Toth:
</em><br>
Amara:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Did you dance? :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not traditional foot scraping, no. :)
</em><br>
<p>must not have had a tsifteteli rhythm ...:-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;however, i do detect the suffering;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it is not really part of my cortex.
</em><br>
<p>For some, it probably _is_ part of the cortex; the &quot;artist&quot; personality
<br>
types: Rudolf Nureyev, Maria Callas, Ingmar Bergman, J.D. Salinger,
<br>
Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, Sting.. for example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Greeks dance when they are grieving to get their suffering out.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;why isn't it sublimated into something else?
</em><br>
<p>because they like it ? (and 2000+ years of doing it might
<br>
have something to do with it)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;for how can the suffering be absolved if the dance is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-referencing (to suffering).
</em><br>
<p>i see your point (interesting feedback loop)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;what leads me to: is this not coming from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the culture? and at what stimulus interval threshold can the culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;/overcome, use, modify/ the material coming from the government?
</em><br>
<p>we pay the government to make our lives miserable.. you see. so the
<br>
Greeks have that spot on :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;most of the popular songs say &quot;yes, i concur, i love you, purchase, america,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life: examine it for a second, i love you&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but i dont know if that is as characteristic as rebetika.
</em><br>
<p>If you can find original 1930s Greek rebetika, please try. You might
<br>
be rolling on the floor in laughter, at least my Greek friend was
<br>
when I was playing mine for her. The Greek is very slangy, and the
<br>
singing is often very bad. The words are both poetic (one sings
<br>
about a girl who &quot;makes the stars fall from the sky&quot; and then a
<br>
backgound singer says: &quot;what? that girl made your head into an
<br>
idiot&quot;), another song talks about a policeman who keeps beating him
<br>
up when he's lying on the street. These are really down-and-out
<br>
homeless 'bums' who's largest crimes are mostly being high or drunk
<br>
or maybe getting into a fight with someone else, or maybe stealing
<br>
some money from their girlfriend. You can instantly hear the mix of
<br>
the 'asian Greeks' because the music sounds oriental. The songs are
<br>
often slow, the bad singing thick, giving a picture of a drunk guy
<br>
shuffling his feet, and the music is extremely expressive- it puts
<br>
you right there. This is really original stuff: utterly charming (imo),
<br>
quite serious at the time, and probably very funny for a Greek to
<br>
listen to today.
<br>
<p>I need to hear more modern rebetika, but if you want 'traditional'
<br>
totally danceable 'European' acoustic music go to www.bratsch.com.
<br>
They might be 'pioneers', except that they have been playing this
<br>
sort of music for 20 years. A violinist, accordianist, clarinetist,
<br>
bouzouki -ist? (he plays guitar too). They have Greek rebetika pieces,
<br>
Macedonian pieces, some klezmer music, some Armenian folk, some
<br>
Ukranian, some Romany. It's music from the 30s, 40s, 50s, all
<br>
traditional, and puts you in the emotional mood of the time (and
<br>
your feet will not help themselves to move). And this group is much
<br>
better live than on their CDs (I've seen them several times in Heidelberg).
<br>
<p>It's snowing here...! First of the season. Nice to see some
<br>
white stuff, but I hope it's warmer down there.

<br>
<p>P.S. Your last name is Hungarian, and you said that you are an
<br>
American boy studying in Thessaloniki. I guess you are a
<br>
'homefull' person too.
