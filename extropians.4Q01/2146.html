Anderson said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the inevitability of this current recession began when the Fed began to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force down interest rates during the mid-1990s. The Fed's actions had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major role in triggering a boom, especially in the high-technology sector
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the economy. As the boom continued, it was fed by artificially low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest rates and a false belief that we had entered a &quot;new economy&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which business cycles were a thing of the past.
</em><br>
<p>Is there any &quot;real&quot; evidence that the Fed is completely to blame here?
<br>
Could there not also be some blame to be shared by the economists who
<br>
were pointing out the tremendous gains in productivity that were
<br>
being attributed to the application of information technologies
<br>
(finally), or to the accumulation of wealth that migrated into
<br>
the hands of VCs who spent it all too often on yet-another
<br>
dot-com business plan, or on the newly minted stock owning
<br>
public who felt they had to play the market at never-before-seen
<br>
P/E ratios or risk losing the lottery?
<br>
<p>To argue that the Fed caused the recession by fueling a boom
<br>
with low interest rates and then to argue that they cannot
<br>
create another boom with similar methods seems to argue that
<br>
the principles are only in effect when the economists want
<br>
them to be.
<br>
<p>I don't disagree in general with the points being made, I just
<br>
object to the idea of an argument of the form &quot;A is true
<br>
(the Fed can cause a boom) except when an economist doesn't
<br>
want it to be true (it won't work this time)&quot;.
