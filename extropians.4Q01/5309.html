<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fame) Americans for Gun Safety in a Orwellian project to assemble a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; private nationwide database of gun ownership by violating the medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; privacy rights of private citizens. If your doctor is aware of, or has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; asked you, your spouse, or your children if there are firearms in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; household, in the past three years, then you are now on this database.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why would they need to ask?  In California they took address and

<em>&gt; &gt; gun purchase time.  It would be pointless for the docs to also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; go snooping.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You do not seem to be aware of what the law actually is. The Insta-check
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system mandated by the Brady Act prohibits the use of such data to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assemble a national gun registration system. When you purchase a gun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your name is checked against a database of those prohibited from purchse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (felons, domestic abusers, insane, etc). If you are not on the database
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those who are prohibited, then the record of you being checked is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be deleted, with no permanent record that your name was ever queried.
</em><br>
<p>A paper prohibition is no real limitation.  I don't believe the
<br>
record is deleted as quite a bit of information was laboriously
<br>
recorded.  They could have simply checked my name in about 10
<br>
seconds.  The information of who bought which guns is most
<br>
certainly kept permanently so police can track weapons afaik.
<br>
But I could be wrong.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, as a matter of fact, he does have that right to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatever he wants for whatever reason he wants.  Just like I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have the right to tell him to mind his own business which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what I am paying him for and what he is presumably trained for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Really, I have never had a doctor ask me any such questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, no, he doesn't. You may say it's okay with you, but under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard principles of medical ethics, it isn't. If a medical provider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advises you of anything, they must have the training and certification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to show that they a) know what they are talking about, and b) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insured for malpractice regarding that. This is why a podiatrist can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advise you about AB/GYN issues, and vice versa etc.: They are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualified to have an opinion. They can refer you to someone who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualified, but they cannot give you a medical opinion about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I didn't know that.  If so it makes doctors inhuman.  I
<br>
automatically assume when any professional is talking about
<br>
something other than their profession that it is opinion and not
<br>
something to be given extra weight.  Seems sufficient to me.   I
<br>
don't see how a doctor could be held legally liable for advising
<br>
you on what type of motorcycle to get unless he claimed that one
<br>
would be better for your health.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The ACLU is as much a terrorist organization as the al Barakhat money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; wiring organization in Somalia is. They may not get their own hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; bloody, but they enable the deaths of thousands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That organization is also not terrorist.  Whatever happened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anarcho-capitalism and especially the cyber version of same?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Al Barakhat has been documented to have funnelled millions of dollars to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; al Qaeda from it's own profits, and is owned by an associate of bin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laden.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Freedom includes the freedom of bad people to move money
<br>
around.  If you want to absolutely stop the second you cannot
<br>
fully claim to support the first.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Did everyone decide these great ideas aren't so great if maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some bad people also use them?  BAH! Some committment to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; freedom.   Damn hypocritical if you ask me.   And no, wiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; money around does not necessarily make you culpable for anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unless you explicitly know what the money is for and endorse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it.  If you say otherwise then you are only a step from saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that ISPs are utterly responsible for every byte of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and intent that goes through their servers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you give a part of your profits to, say, fund Timothy McVeigh's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities, when you know he is a right wing extremist who advocates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing of people, does that no make you party to the conspiracy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That is a huge if and not what I am talking about.  Being a
<br>
&quot;common carrier&quot; for wired money and other things does not make
<br>
you responsible for who wired they money or to whom or for what
<br>
purpose.  I did not argue that those who are directly supporting
<br>
something of this kind are not culpable.  Different discussion.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Al Barakhat does more than just wire money for others who may or may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be legitimate. The fees it charges for such service are used in part to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fund al Qaeda operations. If they just wired money for anybody,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist or no, I'd agree with you. But they do not. They fund it from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own profits.
</em><br>
<p>OK.  But a lot of organizations have been shut down and had
<br>
their assets seized without any legal proceedings I am aware
<br>
of.  What you say here may be exactly true but I worry if we are
<br>
seizing assets without reasonable legal safeguards.  What the
<br>
government claims as justification and what was actually found
<br>
and found in a way the organization or persons got to respond to
<br>
are often quite different things.
