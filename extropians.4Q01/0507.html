<p>Nooooo Spike. Don't refrain from your wisecracks. They are one of the few 
<br>
things on this list that lighten it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Whereas politics can have an extropian focus, our discussions are often

</em><br>
<p>I agree with what you said about political discussions though. I shall 
<br>
refrain being tempted into such exchanges unless there is a clear extropian 
<br>
point to be made. (Heck, political discussions generally seem to come to 
<br>
nothing anyway.)
<br>
<p>My own thoughts on enhancing the signal to noise ratio on this list is to 
<br>
simply have alert people here who post such messages from time to time. We 
<br>
should be our own best regulators.
<br>
<p>While I am here, I should make a note about my posting of the link to the 
<br>
Romeo &amp; Juliet piece. Many will have thought it was just a bit of humor, 
<br>
but I had an additional reason for posting it, which I should really have 
<br>
made clear. Here are the words of Frank Crowell:

<p><em>&gt;An offspring of virtual worlds is the multiuser games now commonly

</em><br>
<em>&gt;noticed in the early to mid 90s on the muds, but has now evolved into its 
</em><br>

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
