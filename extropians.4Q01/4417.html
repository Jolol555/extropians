<p><em>&gt; Look at the incredible insanity of people who are willing to sacrifice their

<p>Unfortunately you don't seem to distinquish between
<br>
&quot;religiosity&quot; and spirituality.
<br>
My spirituality informs my extropian views and vice versa.  I
<br>
don't say others
<br>
need to think like me.  But I also don't cotton to implications
<br>
that I and those
<br>
who do are &quot;the problem&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Excellent analysis, Spike. Let me point out, however, that people in general,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and even some on this email list, fear incorrect meme identification as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as they fear meme-destroying weaponry. A machine that can accurately identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect thinking is the most frightening project in all of technology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science, because such a machine threatens our cherished beliefs, and seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foretell of the displacement of human thought by something better and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I fear those who believe they are so righteous and
<br>
right-thinking that they can
<br>
distinquish when such a machine is working properly and who plan
<br>
to apply it to
<br>
sort human beings.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Granted.  This is what happens in war.  War is a crime.  We hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all war and wish to end it.  Ideally all killing should end.  How?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ideals are not for the real world, because they are self-contradictory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;Support the peace movement, or we'll kill you.&quot; The only way we could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal peace would be to end life altogether. Killing is part of life. Get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ideals are only for the real world.  Where else?  Peace is
<br>
really peace not a threat
<br>
of violence if you disagree.  Killing other sentients is not
<br>
part of my life.  That
<br>
I can choose shows there is a choice.  It is not a &quot;fact of
<br>
nature&quot; that is immutable
<br>
and we can do nothing about it.  We determine our behavior. 
<br>
What will you choose?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, that's it. We want to be safe and secure, but we also want to be free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hence, the Taliban and Al Quaida must go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and I'd add all religious and ideological fanatics as well).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well now.  I am religious (although I mostly have to roll my
<br>
own).  Enough so that
<br>
it is a very central part of my life.  I plan to become an
<br>
interfaith minister.
<br>
Does that make me a &quot;fanatic&quot; that &quot;must go&quot;?  Let us bring it
<br>
down to brass tacks here. 
<br>
Let's bring it to the level of real human beings instead of
<br>
labels.  Because it is at that
<br>
level that the world will be won or lost and that each of us
<br>
will live in heaven or in hell.
