<p>
The FIRST LEGO League is a high-tech sporting event that
<br>
challenges teams of students, ranging in age from 9 to
<br>
14 years old, to design, program and build fully
<br>
autonomous robots using the LEGO MINDSTORMS Robotics
<br>
Invention System™. Teams, consisting of seven to ten
<br>
children and an adult coach, are given a problem
<br>
that requires them to create a programmed robot capable
<br>
of implementing their unique solution to successfully
<br>
complete the Challenge. Approximately 98 teams
<br>
comprising 700 students will compete in the Illinois
<br>
Competition. It will be held from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at
<br>
the Forest View Field House at 2121 S. Goebbert Road
<br>
in Arlington Heights and the public is invited to
<br>
attend.
<br>
<p>This year's challenge, ARCTIC IMPACT requires teams to
<br>
build a robot that can match the challenges found in the
<br>
coldest regions of our world. At the Illinois
<br>
Tournament, teams have the chance to compete for awards
<br>
in areas where their team has excelled, including:
<br>
programming, mechanical design, strategy, problem
<br>
solving, sportsmanship and teamwork. Teams are also
<br>
asked to use their expertise to analyze the data and
<br>
theorize &quot;whether the cause of global climate changes
<br>
are directly related to human interference, or if the
<br>
Earth is experiencing a natural patterned cycle.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;FIRST LEGO League is about reaching these kids when
<br>
it's important,&quot; says FIRST Founder, Dean Kamen. &quot;This
<br>
is a crucial time in their lives and the more positive
<br>
experiences they have with science, math and technology,
<br>
the better chance they have for success in their future.
<br>
The FIRST LEGO League program does what no other program
<br>
does in that it gets the disinterested, interested by
<br>
showing these kids that they can succeed in science
<br>
and math and they can have a blast doing it!&quot;
