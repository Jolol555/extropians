<em>&gt; There would be an evolutionary advantage to any preditor (lions, tigers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.) being able to mentally reherse its strategies for bringing down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prey.  In contrast, grazing animals don't gain much by rehersing which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plants to eat.  The trick that humans may have accomplished is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to bring the rehersal up to the level of self-observation which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be associated with our ability to recognize ourselves in the mirror
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment.
</em><br>
<p>Of note to that thought: the experiment involving cats in which the part of
<br>
the brain that stops voluntary muscle control while sleeping was disabled.
<br>
The cats then behaved and ran around as though chasing things while asleep,
<br>
seeming to indicating that dreaming was used in the rehearsal role above.
