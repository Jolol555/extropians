<em>&gt; This tactic of calling something you disagree with a religion is getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very tedious. It's also a lazy way of not having to make an argument,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead slandering something in a community of mostly non-religious
</em><br>
people.
<br>
<em>&gt; Give us a break. Or wait until you have your own views referred to as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious by someone who disagrees with you (like a humanist dismissing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your transhumanist views). See if you find it a constructive, intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Sorry to be so insensitive--I sometimes forget that religion can be such a
<br>
touchy subject around here. I am less bothered by it. (In fact, in February
<br>
I am reading a paper at the U. of Toronto which argues that the solution to
<br>
the traditional problem of evil is for Christians (et al) to become
<br>
(religious) transhumanists. (<a href="http://www.markalanwalker.com/evil.htm">http://www.markalanwalker.com/evil.htm</a>) BTW, I
<br>
don't hold the converse thesis, that transhumanists ought to be religious)
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but we know a priori technology could never fix the problems of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;nonmarket economies. As penance I politely suggest 7 hail markets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A curious view. If markets have shortcomings, as they surely do, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advance of technology -- so far -- seems to help remedy them. For
</em><br>
instance,
<br>
<em>&gt; markets have a difficult time with a few public goods problems (though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there may be ways around them that are not being used, such as conditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts). Establishing private property rights in things like schools of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fish or airborne pollutants might have been practically impossible in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past. A government solution, crude as it might be may work better. I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grant that there *may* be a reasonable role for government in funding
</em><br>
basic
<br>
<em>&gt; research. (See, I'm not a libertarian.) However, with more advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tracking technology, defining and tracking such property becomes more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasible. I can't think of an instance where advancing technology favors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Just to be clear, I guess you mean by 'more government' more government
<br>
regulation rather than implementation. One could, for example, be for more
<br>
government regulation of drivers licenses--perhaps insisting on yearly
<br>
driving tests for drivers over 100--but like to see driver's license offices
<br>
privatized (as I would). So it is quite consistent, I think, to say that we
<br>
ought to have a lot less government (implementation) with a lot more
<br>
government (regulation). As to your specific question:
<br>
(1) Can governments be totally disinterested in what some will do with
<br>
certain resources? Food fish are often considered a renewable resource. Let
<br>
us suppose we privatize schools of fish and company X buys the rights to all
<br>
of a certain species and fishes them to extinction. Of course it might be
<br>
objected that this would be irrational on their part because they would
<br>
forgo future profits on the fish. However, they say that we are not looking
<br>
at the big picture, they need a quick cash influx so that they can invest
<br>
(say) in some nonfish related technology. We don't even have to imagine that
<br>
the CEO of company X reasons correctly, only that she believes she is
<br>
reasoning correctly about how to maximize the profits of her company.
<br>
Advancing technology makes it possible to completely eradicate a renewable
<br>
resource.
<br>
(2) Can governments be totally disinterested in what is considered a
<br>
resources to be privatized? Are whales a resource or do they have rights?
<br>
Again, as technology advances the ability to hunt them to extinction only
<br>
increases.
<br>
(3) Should governments protect those who want to opt out of the
<br>
technology/market economy? Suppose a  group of people in Nunavut wants to
<br>
keep a traditional hunter/gather life style but can't afford their land
<br>
because it is rich in natural resources that they do not consider resources,
<br>
e.g., gas, or deep mineral deposits etc. Better transportation technology
<br>
means that there is nowhere for anyone to go to escape the long arms of a
<br>
market/technology driven economy.
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm curious to know if you have some real thinking behind your comment. It
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; seems to indicate that you agree that nonmarket economies have real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems. How do you see those problems being fixed by technology? (And
</em><br>
why
<br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't those technologies at the same help markets work more effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- just as we see happening now, as with Web-enabled supply chain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management, customer relationship management software, KM, customer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analytics, embedded wireless RFID tags in tracking, etc. etc.?) If markets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are generally better right now, why not support them until something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly better comes along?
</em><br>
Well, I guess the short answer is that the question not so much about what
<br>
is better now but what ought to come along in the future. The primary focus
<br>
here of course is what the future will or ought to be. As far as I can see,
<br>
both a pure market model and pure nonmarket models have failed, so we are
<br>
left with ad hoc mixed models--more market in the US less so in Canada and
<br>
Europe, but mixed models in all cases. Even you and Damien seem to agree on
<br>
a mixed model, although obviously Damien's guaranteed income is much more
<br>
nonmarket oriented than your vision. And yes, I do think that the best known
<br>
experiments in nonmarket driven societies have failed, and failed miserably.
<br>
Although I must say I am not exactly sure why. Sometimes it is said that
<br>
they failed because they presuppose a false view of human nature. Marx, for
<br>
example, thought that humans are both productive and social by nature and
<br>
that communism would emancipate this true &quot;species being&quot; of humanity. Well,
<br>
he was right that humans are productive and social by nature, but of course
<br>
humans are also unproductive and anti-social by nature. If it is simply a
<br>
matter of having the wrong nature to implement say socialism then it would
<br>
seem (in theory at least) just a matter of reengineering human nature.
<br>
Sometimes the failure of nonmarket mechanism is blamed on the inefficiency
<br>
of information transmission, i.e., that markets are much more efficient
<br>
about transmitting information between producers and consumers. Of course,
<br>
if this is the case then one might wonder whether technology might be able
<br>
to overcome this limitation. Perhaps a deeper understanding of consumption
<br>
and production will allow us to bypass all the little experiments and
<br>
hardships of a market economy. The problem with completely market driven
<br>
societies is to deliver on foresight and fairness. I take it your comment on
<br>
basic research is one about foresight. I have little faith that technology
<br>
will necessarily make the market fairer. Do you think that advances in
<br>
technology will necessarily lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth?
