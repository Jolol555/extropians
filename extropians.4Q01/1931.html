</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think as Extropians we would support the notion that collective and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-human entities should have rights if they are able to request them.
</em><br>
<p>But what exactly is meant by &quot;request them&quot; here?  I think it's pretty easy
<br>
for me to understand a request in English from another human.  However, so
<br>
called collective -- such as the ones you list: &quot;[c]orporations,
<br>
partnerships, marriages, other groupings&quot; -- them don't usually make such
<br>
requests.  Their members do, so they are not truly individuals -- or most
<br>
don't view them as such, especially since their members can and do act
<br>
independently.  For instance, a member of XYZ, Inc. can do stuff that the
<br>
corporation itself would be against.  Typically, a human's mouth does not
<br>
say things it doesn't want to say.  (Yeah, there are exceptional cases, but
<br>
most people don't speak in tongues or have Torette's Syndrome.:)  If they
<br>
did, our social context would be radically different.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We envision a time when social and mental structures will be much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex than the simple distinction we have today between individuals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations.  We could have hybrid beings with some of the properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of both.
</em><br>
<p>I think it might be hard for creatures on lower levels to notice this.  For
<br>
instance, if a collective conscious emerges on the social level, it might
<br>
only communicate with other social level consciousnesses.  It might be
<br>
unaware of its members as you are unaware of your neurons when you're
<br>
thinking.  Heck, from a member's vantage point, the member might not even be
<br>
aware any higher level consciousness exists.  He or she might just react to
<br>
his or her context as you and I currently react to our social context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If two or more people want to hook up their brains and think collectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it should be OK.  If someone wants to subdivide their consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into multiple semi-autonomous parts, that should be permitted as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We should encourage experimentation like this.  It will add diversity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the world and make more opportunities available to everyone.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think anyone was suggesting to disallow this...  However, the rights
<br>
of such entities is still something that has to be worked out, especially in
<br>
regards not just to relations to plain vanilla humans, but in regards to its
<br>
parts or wholes.  For instance, if I could split my mind into several
<br>
subpersonalities, would one of them be allowed to do things that might hurt
<br>
the others?  If I became part of a collective consciousness, would the
<br>
collective consciousness trump my individual rights?  This becomes even more
<br>
important if the new consciousness is emergent and not created by agreement.
<br>
<p>Also, even ones created by agreement -- such as several of us getting
<br>
together to form one group mind -- will not be cut and dry.  After all, we
<br>
might not have worked out all the details...  Suppose we (what's left of the
<br>
&quot;we&quot;:) decide to individuate, but the group mind doesn't want to die?  What
<br>
then?
<br>
<p>Cheers!
