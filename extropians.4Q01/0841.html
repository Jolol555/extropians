Okay, taking Anders statement into account, my reason for presenting this is
<br>
that how markets work often has bearing on how a lot of other spontaneous
<br>
orders behave.  How spontaneous orders behave is a extropy in action, no?
<br>
<p>Enjoy!

<br>
Imperfect Nobel Committees - G Epstein, Barron's
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Why Did This Year's Laureate Trio Win?&quot; By Gene Epstein
<br>
<p>The average person must have chuckled in disbelief, while economists of the
<br>
Austrian school had a right to smile ironically.
<br>
<p>I refer, of course, to this year's winners of the Bank of Sweden Prize in
<br>
Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The 10 million Swedish krona
<br>
(about $950,000 by the current exchange rate) will be shared equally by
<br>
economists George A. Akerlof of the University of California at Berkeley, A.
<br>
Michael Spence of Stanford University, and the best-known by far, Joseph E.
<br>
Stiglitz -- former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under
<br>
President Clinton, most recently chief economist at the World Bank,
<br>
currently at Columbia University, and the subject of a profile in last
<br>
year's Barron's (&quot;Sound the Alarm,&quot; April 17, 2000).
<br>
<p>For the layperson, the funny part was the headline statement about what
<br>
these thinkers won all that money for. The Swedish Academy's press release
<br>
began with, &quot;Many markets are characterized by asymmetric information:
<br>
actors on one side of the market have much better information than those on
<br>
the other.&quot;
<br>
<p>Or as the New York Times put it, &quot;Their theories incorporated `imperfect
<br>
information' into economics -- a concept at odds with the mainstream view
<br>
that markets are all-knowing and self-correcting.&quot; Or as Reuters would have
<br>
it, they &quot;challenged traditional theory that open and unregulated markets
<br>
function with perfect efficiency.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, if economists ever had to be told that markets aren't &quot;all-knowing&quot; or
<br>
&quot;perfect&quot; -- or that, when you go to a specialist about your hemorrhoids, he
<br>
or she knows more than you -- the ordinary person might think they'd want to
<br>
suppress that fact.
<br>
<p>Economists of the Austrian school not only understood that markets can fail,
<br>
they even insisted on that point. In his classic work, Human Action, Ludwig
<br>
von Mises emphasized the &quot;uncertainty inherent in every action,&quot; even adding
<br>
the old adage, &quot;There's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip.&quot; Which isn't to say
<br>
the nature of these slips isn't worth investigating, or that the writings of
<br>
Akerlof, Spence and Stiglitz on that topic lack all insight.
<br>
<p>But once you defrock these authors of their supposedly radical breakthrough,
<br>
then books like Israel Kirzner's Discovery and the Capitalist Process, and
<br>
especially Thomas Sowell's Knowledge and Decisions, turn out to be far more
<br>
enlightening on the topic of imperfect markets. Economists Sowell and
<br>
Kirzner both acknowedge their deep intellectual debt to F. A. Hayek, the
<br>
only Austrian ever to win a Nobel -- and in a better world, the Swedish
<br>
Academy would have bestowed its award on them. At least, Knowledge and
<br>
Decisions comes closer to formulating a &quot;general theory of markets with
<br>
asymmetric information&quot; (to use the Academy's phrase) than anything I've
<br>
read by Akerlof, Spence and Stiglitz.
<br>
<p>Consider a 1970s locus classicus of George A. Akerlof's writings (cited by
<br>
the Academy), &quot;The Market for `Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market
<br>
Mechanism.&quot; It plunges us into a very strange kind of market for cars, with
<br>
no brand names, warranties, dealers with reputations they need to preserve
<br>
or even friendly auto mechanics who might examine a used car before we
<br>
decide to buy it. In Akerlof's words, &quot;There are just four kinds of cars . .
<br>
. A new car may be a good car or a lemon, and of course the same is true of
<br>
used cars.&quot;
<br>
<p>But then, after bringing us through this and related examples, the author
<br>
informs us that, lo and behold, there are indeed &quot;Numerous institutions . .
<br>
. to counteract the effects of quality uncertainty,&quot; including brand names
<br>
and guarantees.
<br>
<p>Or consider a classic 1973 piece by A. Michael Spence, also cited by the
<br>
academy, called &quot;Job Market Signaling.&quot; The author signals that he thinks
<br>
he's onto something big by coyly refusing to define &quot;market signaling.&quot; But
<br>
plow on, and you find the insight is simply that people might edge out
<br>
others for a job by going to college -- i.e., by &quot;signaling&quot; that they're
<br>
smarter or perhaps more persistent than most, rather than specifically
<br>
competent to do the work.
<br>
<p>But even this frail insight gets a bit confused. The author cynically
<br>
informs us that, while education need not be &quot;strictly unproductive . . . if
<br>
it is too productive relative to the costs, everyone will invest heavily in
<br>
education, and education ceases to have a signaling function.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, no; you can stand out from the crowd (signal you're better) by being
<br>
first in your class, or by getting a stellar recommendation from your
<br>
teacher.
<br>
<p>Finally, terms like &quot;market failure,&quot; which recur in Stiglitz' writings,
<br>
often lead to a grand non sequitur invoked by the press last week: that
<br>
where markets fail, government intervention succeeds. Better to speak of
<br>
institutional failure, since institutions fail us all the time, but market
<br>
institutions far less than others.
