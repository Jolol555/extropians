</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Okay, so in your view of the world, there's something external to humanity
<br>
which humans make use of in order to reach conclusions that are beyond the
<br>
reach of &quot;rationality&quot; as usually understood.  Is this a fair
<br>
description?  Or are we talking about a Platonic as opposed to material
<br>
existence here, in the same sense that a mathematician might say that
<br>
mathematics has always existed and that it works everywhere when you know
<br>
how to see it?
<br>
<p>&quot;You can see it work everywhere when you know how&quot; is needless to say a
<br>
rather suspicious statement.  I can see gravity work even if I know
<br>
nothing about General Relativity.  I may not know that it's called
<br>
&quot;gravity&quot;, but I can still see the effects.  Where the model of the
<br>
universe is incomplete (saying nothing about gravity) there is a
<br>
perceptible gap, an observed effect without a hypothesized cause, and this
<br>
gap in the worldview is where new knowledge enters.  Let us suppose for
<br>
the sake of discussion that I do not understand this thing called
<br>
spirituality.  Where is the corresponding gap in my worldview that needs
<br>
filling?
