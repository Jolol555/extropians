</em><br>
<p>OK let's try some facts (well, some sources that quote facts...). Here's a
<br>
quote from Steve Coll writing in the Washington Post in 1992:
<br>
<p>&quot;In March 1985, President Reagan signed National Security Decision Directive
<br>
166,...[which] authorize[d] stepped-up covert military aid to the
<br>
mujahideen, and it made clear that the secret Afghan war had a new goal: to
<br>
defeat Soviet troops in Afghanistan through covert action and encourage a
<br>
Soviet withdrawal. The new covert U.S. assistance began with a dramatic
<br>
increase in arms supplies -- a steady rise to 65,000 tons annually by 1987,
<br>
... as well as a &quot;ceaseless stream&quot; of CIA and Pentagon specialists who
<br>
traveled to the secret headquarters of Pakistan's ISI on the main road near
<br>
Rawalpindi, Pakistan. There the CIA specialists met with Pakistani
<br>
intelligence officers to help plan operations for the Afghan rebels&quot;
<br>
<p>So far so good , no Taliban, or Bin Laden right now - just US vs Soviet
<br>
Union. But US strategy at that time was to encourage militant Islam in
<br>
Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. Here's a quote from Ahmed Rashid's Yale
<br>
University Press book (online extract at
<br>
<a href="http://www.public-i.org/excerpts_01_091301.htm">http://www.public-i.org/excerpts_01_091301.htm</a>)
<br>
<p>&quot;Casey committed CIA support to a long-standing ISI initiative to recruit
<br>
radical Muslims from around the world to come to Pakistan and fight with the
<br>
Afghan Mujaheddin. The ISI had encouraged this since 1982, and by now all
<br>
the other players had their reasons for supporting the idea.
<br>
<p>President Zia aimed to cement Islamic unity, turn Pakistan into the leader
<br>
of the Muslim world and foster an Islamic opposition in Central Asia.
<br>
Washington wanted to demonstrate that the entire Muslim world was fighting
<br>
the Soviet Union alongside the Afghans and their American benefactors. And
<br>
the Saudis saw an opportunity both to promote Wahabbism [their strict and
<br>
austere creed] and to get rid of its disgruntled radicals. None of the
<br>
players reckoned on these volunteers having their own agendas, which would
<br>
eventually turn their hatred against the Soviets on their own regimes and
<br>
the Americans.&quot;
<br>
<p>And the final piece of the jigsaw is that Bin Laden was encouraged to come
<br>
to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. Here's an excerpt from the US
<br>
Government's own bio (<a href="http://usembassy.state.gov/afghanistan/wwwhtr01.html">http://usembassy.state.gov/afghanistan/wwwhtr01.html</a>)
<br>
<p>&quot;Usama Bin Ladin left Saudi Arabia to fight against the Soviets in
<br>
Afghanistan in 1979. In the mid-1980s he co-founded the Maktab al-Khidamat
<br>
(MAK) or Services Office, to help funnel fighters and  money to the Afghan
<br>
resistance in Peshawar with a Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood member named
<br>
'Abdallah 'Azzam. The MAK ultimately established recruitment centers around
<br>
the world -- including in the U.S., Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan --
<br>
that  enlisted, sheltered, and transported thousands of individuals from
<br>
over 50 countries to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also see <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/190144.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/news/190144.asp</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *What* possible agenda could the U.S. have where it would promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the success of fundamentalist Islamic memes ?!?
</em><br>
<p>I think this should be obvious from the above. The US Government, through
<br>
the CIA and the ISI as its proxy, appears to have encouraged militant Islam
<br>
in Afghanistan as a way of fighting the Soviet Union. Of course, this does
<br>
not mean *in any way* that the ultimate consequences (Bin Laden, Taliban
<br>
etc) were in intended. But it does suggest that the US entanglement (and
<br>
responsibility) in Afghanistan is much more complex than you suggest.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Geraint
