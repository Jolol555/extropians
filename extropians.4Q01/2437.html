where the problem could be solved. 
<br>
<p>Amara,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can imagine what it is like to be the only American surrounded by a 
<br>
verbally hostile foreign population.  However in your heart of hearts don't 
<br>
you think it is time to question this &quot;The Americans are so young and 
<br>
inexperienced&quot; stuff.  There are very few governments as old as ours.  Maybe 
<br>
Britain certainly not Germany, Italy nor France.  When my German ancestors 
<br>
were coming here in the 1700s they weren't even called German -- there 
<br>
practically wasn't any such place.  How many times within the life time of 
<br>
our country have those folks changed their entire form of government?  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to their being frightened of hostilities in their lands.  Our 
<br>
people know something of that.  We had our Civil War those of us in the South 
<br>
have heard the stories.  Even since that time we have had our Indian wars.  
<br>
We don't feel bullet proof by any means.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are not going to turn our backs on having thousands of our 
<br>
fellow citizens killed.  Amara, I don't expect you would know this in Germany 
<br>
-- but almost all of us at least knows someone that knew someone that died.  
<br>
This is not an event that happened to distant stranger miles from us.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have since been attacked with Anthrax.  You should look at a map of 
<br>
where the attacks have taken place.  The government is concerned enough to 
<br>
test a postal station a few miles from where I sit.  Is this light flu that 
<br>
hung on for days flu or is it something else that I threw off?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you are right about the seriousness of what could come out of 
<br>
this.  This could get out of hand and become WWIII.  But there is one thing 
<br>
for sure.  They have elected us king of the hill and in their jealousy they 
<br>
are out to remove us.  We are not going to wait for them to come cut our 
<br>
throats.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which brings me to my deepest concern.  A lot of poor uneducated 
<br>
middle eastern boys and a lot of our young men are going to die before this 
<br>
is over.  At least let us conduct ourselves so as to be as economical as 
<br>
possible of innocent American, European and Middle Eastern lives.  If we have 
<br>
to kill OBL and the terrorist let us do it with a minimum loss of our lives.
<br>
