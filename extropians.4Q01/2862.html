<em>&gt; &gt;It was a crazy night; I would never have dreamed that you would see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that kind of traffic on those twisty mountain roads at 2 in the

<em>&gt; &gt;morning.  I'm glad we got to see the Leonids, but I don't think I

<em>&gt; &gt;would do it again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still it warms my heart to know that so many people went to see it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Astronomy events like the Shoemaker-Levy-9 impact, comet Hale-Bopp,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the '99 total solar eclipse, the Leonids, etc. gets people out and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *looking up*.  Very important. It's nice feedback for astronomers too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see that nonastronomers are interested in astronomy.
</em><br>
<p>I was at deer hunting camp, the last night of the trip. Since the
<br>
outhouse is outside, of course (;)), the 5 am bladder call reminded me
<br>
to get up and get outside in time to catch the show. Stumbled in the
<br>
dark for the flashlight to find the door, shuffled out onto the back
<br>
porch to drop trou and give a tree stump a golden shower. I stood there
<br>
relieving myself as a cow moose stood 40 feet away in the dark in the
<br>
middle of the road, and looked up, watching the glittering sparkles, the
<br>
cosmic diamonds streak their way across the sky. How about that, two
<br>
showers at the same time! Luckily old Leo had more business to do than
<br>
I, so I could stay there and watch without further distraction for a
<br>
while longer. The moose snorted at the sky and crashed off into the
<br>
woods, undoubtedly pursuing more tasty fill down in the swamp. The only
<br>
other sounds were the hoots of a screech owl and the distant roar of the
<br>
Swift Diamond River. 
<br>
<p>The pine marten that hangs around camp had done one too many raids on
<br>
the garbage can and bought it the day before from a quarter ounce lead
<br>
shot injection, so he wasn't around to scold me for interfering with his
<br>
midnight ventures to the cesspit for toilet paper to line his den for
<br>
the winter. (the pine marten is a large cousin of the weasel)
<br>
<p>My cousin, Drew, the geologist I've spoken of occasionally who has been
<br>
to Antarctica and dreams of being on a Mars mission some day, came out a
<br>
little bit later. I went inside, as this flu I picked up last wednesday
<br>
annoys me in the cold.
