<p>I had a couple of problems with that right off.  Not that I challenged their
<br>
data, just that it raised some obvious questions.  How is it that the
<br>
mitochondria in the cells in general mutates so much while the mitochondria
<br>
passed on in the egg does not?  (If it did, then each generation would have
<br>
more defective eggs, which does not generally appear to be the case.) 
<br>
<p>### Actually, as far as I know, the germ line mitos degrade as well, but
<br>
this is a stochastic process - if you have 450 000 oocytes (the approximate
<br>
number in a female newborn, if I remember correctly), some of them will by
<br>
chance keep all of their mitos intact. During the maturation of an oocyte
<br>
there are checkpoints, eliminating all the oocytes with insufficient
<br>
energy-producing capability by apoptosis. This is not a fully foolproof
<br>
method, as there are some specific mitochondrial mutations (as in MELAS,
<br>
LHON) which apparently escape this mechanism, resulting in maternally
<br>
inherited &quot;classical&quot; mitochondrial diseases.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
&nbsp;Secondly, why is it that the proportion of defective mitochondria
<br>
increases?  What happens to select for them as opposed to selecting for
<br>
cells with the best mitochondrial genes?
<br>
<p>### It is possible that there is not so much a selection for mutated mitos,
<br>
but rather an absence of intracellullar selection for the healthy ones
<br>
(except in the germ line). Mutations keep accumulating, because every now
<br>
and then a normal genome gets hit but the mutated ones do not spontaneausly
<br>
revert to wild type. Even with 10 000 mtDNA genomes per cell, after some
<br>
time the fraction of mutated copies is high enough to cause diminished
<br>
energy output, and eventually death of the cell (usually by apoptosis). If
<br>
this process goes on in postmitotic tissues, the result is e.g. Parkinson's
<br>
disease and possibly even Alzheimer's disease.
<br>
&nbsp;-----
<br>
<p>One hypothesis that I arrived at finally, which I would appreciate comment
<br>
on, is that a higher level of energy production for a cell means a shorter
<br>
doubling time and consequently a faster arrival at the Hayflick limit.
<br>
I.e., assuming that cellular reproduction occurs in response to a signal and
<br>
that the response likelihood is dependent upon available energy - which may
<br>
not be the case, but it does seem reasonable - then those cells with an
<br>
abundance of energy would be more likely to respond.  Thus, over time, cells
<br>
that have poorer mitochondria tend to dominate, simply because their
<br>
telomeres are longer, having not divided as many times.
<br>
<p>### I think that so far there was no clear proof that the Hayflick limit is
<br>
important for human aging. The most quickly dividing cells (as in the small
<br>
bowel, or the hematopoietic system) are not most limiting for survival -
<br>
this seems to be most affected by postmitotic cell attrition, in the brain,
<br>
skeletal muscle, and myocardium, as well as problems with the nuclear genome
<br>
(leading to cancer). It is possible that all you need is the accumulation of
<br>
mtDNA mutations, and the absence of a strong selective mechanism *for*
<br>
healthy ones (as in the germ line).
<br>
<p>---- 
<br>
<p>If this is the case, it is interesting to speculate upon the effects of
<br>
different populations of mitochondria.  If one had only mitochondria of a
<br>
particular kind, how would this influence lifespan, as opposed to having a
<br>
variety of widely varying mitochondria, ranging from high output to useless.
<br>
A person with a wide variety of mitochondria might be expected to age rather
<br>
dramatically as various cell populations with varying proportions hit the
<br>
Hayflick limit early or late.  A person with only one breed of mitochondria
<br>
could be expected to age uniformly, with less likelihood of catastrophic
<br>
organ failure.
<br>
<p>###There are dramatic examples of variability in the severity of
<br>
mitochondrial disease between siblings - they can inherit varying ratios of
<br>
the mutated genomes (it's called heteroplasmy), so that some can die as
<br>
infants while others survive into adulthood. Variability between tissues in
<br>
an individual is also observed, and this is possibly another reason for the
<br>
heterogenous presentation of mitochondrial disease.
