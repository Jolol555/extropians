<p>
Just a couple of quick things that came to mind:
<br>
<p>The &quot;eureka!&quot; experience comes as a result of solving a problem, in
<br>
which effort had been expended, and that expenditure was expected to
<br>
continue.   Typically, sets of ideas may be in conflict, and an effort
<br>
is being made to visualize a resolution, a new idea set that resolves
<br>
the disparities or apparent contradictions.  Because that effort
<br>
requires focusing on conflicting ideas, and the mind is not capable of
<br>
holding an actual contradiction in conscious focus, it has to work
<br>
around the problem, looking for elements in common, and switching back
<br>
and forth between the conflicting perspectives.  
<br>
<p>As Koestler discusses in &quot;The Act of Creation,&quot; this creates a state of
<br>
internal tension, whose resolution results in a sudden release of that
<br>
tension, a feeling of vast relief, the sensation that a load has been
<br>
lifted, that new perspectives, previously blocked by the problem, are
<br>
now available, etc. - the &quot;eureka!.&quot;  There is a parallet, which I have
<br>
mentioned before, in humor.  As Koestler, again in &quot;The Act...&quot;
<br>
analyzes, every humorous event consists of forcing the mind unexpectedly
<br>
to focus on something in two contradictory ways simultaneously.  
<br>
<p>Again, since this is impossible, the mind actually flashes back and
<br>
forth between the two (or more) perspectives.  But, although the
<br>
functions of the mind that are explicitly based on nervous impulses and
<br>
internal processing within neurons can oscillate relatively rapidly
<br>
between the different meanings, for example, of a pun, the emotional
<br>
part of the brain has a lag, as it pumps out hormones, etc. to prepare
<br>
the mind/brain system for the current demands.  Ie., it can't keep up.
<br>
In particular, it can't cancel out or reabsorb the chemicals nearly as
<br>
fast as the cognitive oscillation.  So, instead, it overrides each
<br>
previous state by increasing the level of chemicals, an exponential
<br>
slope that very quickly maxes out the system, resulting in a release
<br>
process we call laughter.  The original emotional load of the two
<br>
contradictory perspectives may have been very small, but throw in that
<br>
exponential, and the result is the same.
<br>
<p>Regarding another recent set of postings having to do with the origins
<br>
of consciousness:  I recall seeing an article hypothesizing that when we
<br>
chimpanzees split up into the forest versus the savannah chimps, that
<br>
the savannah chimps suddenly needed to be able to throw accurately, not
<br>
nearly as valuable a skill in the dense jungle.  Our brother chimps
<br>
still in the jungle are notoriously inept throwers.  The advantage
<br>
gained by accurate throwing was evolutionarilly self-preserving and
<br>
self-reinforcing, and only increased that much more during the ice ages.
<br>
Throwing accurately, however, requires projecting ahead in time,
<br>
visualizing results and consequences.
<br>
<p>On a further note, re the bicameral brain theory of consciousness,
<br>
Koestler also had some things to say, long before Jaynes wrote.  He
<br>
pointed out (again, &quot;The Act...&quot;) that no one painted accurate clouds
<br>
until a particular artist analyzed all the different types of clouds and
<br>
developed a classification and nomenclature which we still use.
<br>
Suddenly everyone then was painting clouds that looked real..  Simlarly,
<br>
consciousness of self requires a means of discriminating between
<br>
different self-states.  Such a discrimination and consequent awareness
<br>
is only possible beyond a rudimentary level if one has learned a set of
<br>
differentia and geni and a nomenclature to label the events.
