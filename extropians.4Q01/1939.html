Mike asked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, that must be my problem. For years I've consistently run a full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree below normal body temp (my temp the other day donating blood:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 97.6 degrees F). Does this contribute to my expected heritable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longevity as well?
</em><br>
<p>Difficult to say.  If you just have specific gene variants that
<br>
make the uncoupling proteins inefficient or don't produce enough
<br>
of them then certainly you would have a low temperature.  It
<br>
would be bad if the mitochondrial gradient was kept high due
<br>
to the free radical damage that would result.  But its probably
<br>
more likely (particularly given indications for longevity) that
<br>
the polymorphisms are further upstream, perhaps in the
<br>
electron transport chain or even further back in the more
<br>
basic metabolism of glucose.  You may not have enough of
<br>
a gradient across the mitochondrial membranes to generate
<br>
enough heat even if the uncoupling proteins are running
<br>
full tilt.  In that case you don't really have to worry
<br>
about free radical damage as much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've also noticed that when I take significant measures to raise my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metabolism (no, not any drugs), my anxiety levels also increase. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be the connection?
</em><br>
<p>Hard to say.  Obviously down through time, Nature has selected
<br>
genetic polymorphisms that work &quot;well&quot; together.  Often this
<br>
can be because the genes sit next to each other on a chromosome
<br>
and are unlikely to get shuffled from one generation to the next.
<br>
(Recombination rates vary with chromosome distance -- larger
<br>
inter-gene distances ~= larger recombination frequency).
<br>
So whatever the sensing mechanisms are for &quot;anxiety&quot;, they
<br>
may be tied to things like blood glucose levels, thyroid
<br>
hormone levels, etc. and you have gene sets where low
<br>
metabolic rate = low anxiety.  I suspect however that you
<br>
might be able to &quot;train&quot; the anxiety response using some
<br>
biofeedback techniques.
