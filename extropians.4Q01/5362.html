Artificial Intelligence and Issues from the &quot;Virtual Office&quot; and &quot;Virtual
<br>
Courtroom.&quot; The success of &quot;Big Blue&quot; on the chess board may just be a
<br>
precursor of artificial intelligence in the boardroom and courtroom. As more
<br>
and more information is available, the average judge or juror may not have the
<br>
ability or expertise to assess this information and render prompt, reasonable
<br>
decisions. The science of the future may exceed human ability to analyze legal
<br>
issues, determine who is and is not telling the truth, draft contracts and
<br>
wills, etc. Will this have the same impact as DNA analysis in determining
<br>
paternity? What role will humans play in the face of advanced artificial
<br>
intelligence? What will the social effects be through
<br>
video-conferencing/holographic images in the event it is not necessary to
<br>
physically come to a courthouse? Will lawyers and judges still be regarded as
<br>
being in a major profession?

A Jurisprudence of Artilects
<br>
Blueprint for a Synthetic Citizen
<br>
<a href="http://www.sudialab.com/artilaw.htm">http://www.sudialab.com/artilaw.htm</a>
<br>
The advent of artificial intellects (artilects) with knowledge and reasoning
<br>
capacity surpassing humans will create new legal issues.  New rules and
<br>
standards may be required to govern their use and behavior.  In particular it
<br>
is feared that they may become a super-race that eclipses humanity, holds the
<br>
lesser capabilities of humans in disdain, and seeks to marginalize or
<br>
eliminate humans.
<br>
In this high level survey of basic legal issues regarding the relationships of
<br>
humans and artilects, I argue that granting legal recognition to non-human
<br>
entities should not pose insurmountable problems since it has already been
<br>
done for corporations.  As incorporeal entities artilects will be highly
<br>
dependent on our legal and political system to secure their rights, and hence
<br>
are likely to become model citizens.  And, unlike other minority groups
<br>
seeking recognition, they will have elite professional and corporate sponsors
<br>
to smooth the way for them.

Artificial Intelligence and The Law
<br>
<a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/lawreform/tech/13.html">http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/lawreform/tech/13.html</a>
<br>
&quot; ...within 20 years, artificial intelligence should become the dominant
<br>
software technology of the digital revolution. There will be intelligent
<br>
machines that provide services, track your needs, have emotions, and interact
<br>
with each other across a vast network. There will be tools that learn and
<br>
reason about huge volumes of information and smart interfaces willing to
<br>
discuss your needs in English. All this will be part of everyday activity. It
<br>
will also dramatically change the way we live, work and play.&quot;
<br>
While these predictions may seem exaggerated, the Committee believes that AI
<br>
does have the potential to impact on several areas of legal service delivery
<br>
and the administration of justice. As AI cannot be easily relegated to any one
<br>
area of the Inquiry, the Committee has decided to devote a chapter to
<br>
investigating the nature of AI, its current uses in law, its potential use in
<br>
the future and its limitations.

&quot;cognitive liberty jurisprudence&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.alchemind.org/1JCL/1jcl7.htm">http://www.alchemind.org/1JCL/1jcl7.htm</a>
<br>
while certain justices have, at times, pointedly acknowledged the fundamental
<br>
nature of cognitive freedom and the nefarious nature of government (or other
<br>
&quot;outside&quot;) interference with the intellect, this important freedom remains
<br>
only obliquely defined within the US legal system. Ironically, the lack of a
<br>
comprehensive treatment may be because cognitive freedom is so self-evidently
<br>
a basic human right. Whatever the reason, without a coherent cognitive liberty
<br>
jurisprudence, present and future infringements on cognitive liberty risk
<br>
passing unnoticed or unremedied. In the next installment of this essay, we
<br>
will begin to dig deep into privacy, due process, and First Amendment cases,
<br>
in an attempt to excavate a theoretical scaffolding for cognitive liberty. As
<br>
I believe the cases will show, cognitive liberty is the invisible landscape
<br>
from which springs some of our most cherished and protected freedoms.
