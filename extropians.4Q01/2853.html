</em><br>
<p>What can you do with your supra-rationality that I can't do with my plain
<br>
old rationality?  I mean, calling some system &quot;supra-rationality&quot; is a
<br>
heck of a strong claim.  I understand that really strong claims aren't
<br>
always easy to prove even if they're true, so I'm not asking for proof. 
<br>
What I'm asking for is suggestive evidence.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, spirituality can also turn off highly talented people
<br>
dedicated to creating the future.  Even things that aren't spiritual but
<br>
that bear some imagined resemblance to spirituality can turn off highly
<br>
talented people.  The sometimes irrational reactions of people who are
<br>
highly talented are quite irrelevant to where the truth or falsity lies,
<br>
at least if you're considering the problem as a problem and not as a
<br>
public relations exercise.
<br>
<p>But if you want to ask &quot;What good are put-downs of active spirituality?&quot;
<br>
then one is perfectly justified in coming back and saying &quot;What good is it
<br>
to tread on spiritual grounds at all?&quot;  After all, the largest religion in
<br>
the world is Islam, which still has only 25% of the world population, so
<br>
anything you say is going to tick off at least 75% of the audience.  If
<br>
it's worth going there for the sake of the truth, then all that matters in
<br>
considering a put-down of active spirituality is whether the put-down is
<br>
true, not who the put-down offends.
