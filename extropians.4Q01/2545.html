Democracy: The God That Failed
<br>
by Hans-Hermann Hoppe
<br>
<p>from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe4.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe4.html</a>
<br>
<p>At the request of LRC, Professor Hoppe discusses his extremely important new
<br>
book, Democracy: The God That Failed (Transaction Publishers, Rutgers, NJ:
<br>
2001).
<br>
<p>Theory and History
<br>
<p>On the most abstract level, I want to show how theory is indispensible in
<br>
correctly interpreting history. History - the sequence of events unfolding
<br>
in time - is &quot;blind.&quot; It reveals nothing about causes and effects. We may
<br>
agree, for instance, that feudal Europe was poor, that monarchical Europe
<br>
was wealthier, and that democratic Europe is wealthier still, or that
<br>
nineteenth-century America with its low taxes and few regulations was poor,
<br>
while contemporary America with its high taxes and many regulations is rich.
<br>
Yet was Europe poor because of feudalism, and did it grow richer because of
<br>
monarchy and democracy? Or did Europe grow richer in spite of monarchy and
<br>
democracy? Or are these phenomena unrelated?
<br>
<p>Likewise, is contemporary America wealthier because of higher taxes and more
<br>
regulations or in spite of them? That is, would America be even more
<br>
prosperous if taxes and regulations had remained at their nineteenth-century
<br>
levels? Historians qua historians cannot answer such questions, and no
<br>
amount of statistical data manipulation can change this fact. Every sequence
<br>
of empirical events is compatible with any of a number of rival, mutually
<br>
incompatible interpretations.
<br>
<p><p>To make a decision regarding such incompatible interpretations, we need a
<br>
theory. By theory I mean a proposition whose validity does not depend on
<br>
further experience but can be established a priori. This is not to say that
<br>
one can do without experience altogether in establishing a theoretical
<br>
proposition. However, it is to say that even if experience is necessary,
<br>
theoretical insights extend and transcend logically beyond a particular
<br>
historical experience. Theoretical propositions are about necessary facts
<br>
and relations and, by implication, about impossibilities. Experience may
<br>
thus illustrate a theory. But historical experience can neither establish a
<br>
theorem nor refute it.
<br>
<p>The Austrian School
<br>
<p>Economic and political theory, especially of the Austrian variety, is a
<br>
treasure trove of such propositions. For instance, a larger quantity of a
<br>
good is preferred to a smaller amount of the same good; production must
<br>
precede consumption; what is consumed now cannot be consumed again in the
<br>
future; prices fixed below market-clearing prices will lead to lasting
<br>
shortages; without private property in production factors there can be no
<br>
factor prices, and without factor prices cost-accounting is impossible; an
<br>
increase in the supply of paper money cannot increase total social wealth
<br>
but can only redistribute existing wealth; monopoly (the absence of free
<br>
entry) leads to higher prices and lower product quality than competition; no
<br>
thing or part of a thing can be owned exclusively by more than one party at
<br>
a time; democracy (majority rule) and private property are incompatible.
<br>
<p>Theory is no substitute for history, of course, yet without a firm grasp of
<br>
theory serious errors in the interpretation of historical data are
<br>
unavoidable. For instance, the outstanding historian Carroll Quigley claims
<br>
that the invention of fractional reserve banking has been a major cause of
<br>
the unprecedented expansion of wealth associated with the Industrial
<br>
Revolution, and countless historians have associated the economic plight of
<br>
Soviet-style socialism with the absence of democracy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a theoretical viewpoint, such interpretations must be rejected
</em><br>
categorically. An increase in the paper money supply cannot lead to greater
<br>
prosperity but only to wealth redistribution. The explosion of wealth during
<br>
the Industrial Revolution took place despite fractional reserve banking.
<br>
Similarly, the economic plight of socialism cannot be due to the absence of
<br>
democracy. Instead, it is caused by the absence of private property in
<br>
factors of production. &quot;Received history&quot; is full of such
<br>
misinterpretations. Theory allows us to rule out certain historical reports
<br>
as impossible and incompatible with the nature of things. By the same token,
<br>
it allows us to uphold certain other things as historical possibilities,
<br>
even if they have not yet been tried.
<br>
<p>Revisionist History
<br>
<p>More interestingly, armed with elementary economic and political theory, I
<br>
present in my book a revisionist reconstruction of modern Western history:
<br>
of the rise of absolute monarchical states out of state-less feudal orders,
<br>
and the transformation, beginning with the French Revolution and essentially
<br>
completed with the end of World War I, of the Western world from monarchical
<br>
to democratic States, and the rise of the US to the rank of &quot;universal
<br>
empire.&quot; Neo-conservative writers such as Francis Fukuyama have interpreted
<br>
this development as civilizational progress, and they proclaim the &quot;End of
<br>
History&quot; to have arrived with the triumph of Western - US - democracy and
<br>
its globalization (making the world safe for democracy).
<br>
<p>Myth One
<br>
<p>My theoretical interpretation is entirely different. It involves the
<br>
shattering of three historical myths. The first and most fundamental is the
<br>
myth that the emergence of states out of a prior, non-statist order has
<br>
caused subsequent economic and civilizational progress. In fact, theory
<br>
dictates that any progress must have occurred in spite - not because - of
<br>
the institution of a state.
<br>
<p>A state is defined conventionally as an agency that exercises a compulsory
<br>
territorial monopoly of ultimate decison-making (jurisdiction) and of
<br>
taxation. By definition then, every state, regardless of its particular
<br>
constitution, is economically and ethically deficient. Every monopolist is
<br>
&quot;bad&quot; from the viewpoint of consumers. Monopoly is hereby understood as the
<br>
absence of free entry into a particular line of production: only one agency,
<br>
A, may produce X.
<br>
<p>Any monopoly is &quot;bad&quot; for consumers because, shielded from potential new
<br>
entrants into its line of production, the price for its product will be high
<br>
er and the quality lower than with free entry. And a monopolist with
<br>
ultimate decison-making powers is particularly bad. While other monopolists
<br>
produce inferior goods, a monopolist judge, besides producing inferior
<br>
goods, will produce bads, because he who is the ultimate judge in every case
<br>
of conflict also has the last word in each conflict involving himself.
<br>
Consequently, instead of preventing and resolving conflict, a monopolist of
<br>
ultimate decision-making will cause and provoke conflict in order to settle
<br>
it to his own advantage.
<br>
<p>Not only would no one accept such a monopoly judge provision, but no one
<br>
would ever agree to a provision that allowed this judge to determine the
<br>
price to be paid for his &quot;service&quot; unilaterally. Predictably, such a
<br>
monopolist would use up ever more resources (tax revenue) to produce fewer
<br>
goods and perpetrate more bads. This is not a prescription for protection
<br>
but for oppression and exploitation. The result of a state, then, is not
<br>
peaceful cooperation and social order, but conflict, provocation,
<br>
aggression, oppression, and impoverishment, i.e., de-civilization. This,
<br>
above all, is what the history of states illustrates. It is first and
<br>
foremost the history of countless millions of innocent state victims.
<br>
<p>Myth Two
<br>
<p>The second myth concerns the historic transition from absolute monarchies to
<br>
democratic states. Not only do neoconservatives interpret this development
<br>
as progress; there is near-universal agreement that democracy represents an
<br>
advance over monarchy and is the cause of economic and moral progress. This
<br>
interpretation is curious in light of the fact that democracy has been the
<br>
fountainhead of every form of socialism: of (European) democratic socialism
<br>
and (American) liberalism and neo-conservatism as well as of international
<br>
(Soviet) socialism, (Italian) fascism, and national (Nazi) socialism. More
<br>
importantly, however, theory contradicts this interpretation; whereas both
<br>
monarchies and democracies are deficient as states, democracy is worse than
<br>
monarchy.
<br>
<p>Theoretically speaking, the transition from monarchy to democracy involves
<br>
no more or less than a hereditary monopoly &quot;owner&quot; - the prince or king -
<br>
being replaced by temporary and interchangeable - monopoly &quot;caretakers&quot; -
<br>
presidents, prime ministers, and members of parliament. Both kings and
<br>
presidents will produce bads, yet a king, because he &quot;owns&quot; the monopoly and
<br>
may sell or bequeath it, will care about the repercussions of his actions on
<br>
capital values. As the owner of the capital stock on &quot;his&quot; territory, the
<br>
king will be comparatively future-oriented. In order to preserve or enhance
<br>
the value of his property, he will exploit only moderately and
<br>
calculatingly. In contrast, a temporary and interchangeable democratic
<br>
caretaker does not own the country, but as long as he is in office he is
<br>
permitted to use it to his advantage. He owns its current use but not its
<br>
capital stock. This does not eliminate exploitation. Instead, it makes
<br>
exploitation shortsighted (present-oriented) and uncalculated, i.e., carried
<br>
out without regard for the value of the capital stock.
<br>
<p>Nor is it an advantage of democracy that free entry into every state
<br>
position exists (whereas under monarchy entry is restricted by the king's
<br>
discretion). To the contrary, only competition in the production of goods is
<br>
a good thing. Competition in the production of bads is not good; in fact, it
<br>
is sheer evil. Kings, coming into their position by virtue of birth, might
<br>
be harmless dilettantes or decent men (and if they are &quot;madmen,&quot; they will
<br>
be quickly restrained or if need be, killed, by close relatives concerned
<br>
with the possessions of the dynasty). In sharp contrast, the selection of
<br>
government rulers by means of popular elections makes it essentially
<br>
impossible for a harmless or decent person to ever rise to the top.
<br>
Presidents and prime ministers come into their position as a result of their
<br>
efficiency as morally uninhibited demagogues. Hence, democracy virtually
<br>
assures that only dangerous men will rise to the top of government.
<br>
<p>In particular, democracy is seen as promoting an increase in the social rate
<br>
of time preference (present-orientation) or the &quot;infantilization&quot; of
<br>
society. It results in continually increased taxes, paper money and paper
<br>
money inflation, an unending flood of legislation, and a steadily growing
<br>
&quot;public&quot; debt. By the same token, democracy leads to lower savings,
<br>
increased legal uncertainty, moral relativism, lawlessness, and crime.
<br>
Further, democracy is a tool for wealth and income confiscation and
<br>
redistribution. It involves the legislative &quot;taking&quot; of the property of
<br>
some - the haves of something - and the &quot;giving&quot; of it to others - the
<br>
have-nots of things. And since it is presumably something valuable that is
<br>
being redistributed - of which the haves have too much and the have-nots too
<br>
little - any such redistribution implies that the incentive to be of value
<br>
or produce something valuable is systematically reduced. In other words, the
<br>
proportion of not-so-good people and not-so-good personal traits, habits,
<br>
and forms of conduct and appearance will increase, and life in society will
<br>
become increasingly unpleasant.
<br>
<p>Last but not least, democracy is described as resulting in a radical change
<br>
in the conduct of war. Because they can externalize the costs of their own
<br>
aggression onto others (via taxes), both kings and presidents will be more
<br>
than 'normally' aggressive and warlike. However, a king's motive for war is
<br>
typically an ownership-inheritance dispute. The objective of his war is
<br>
tangible and territorial: to gain control over some piece of real estate and
<br>
its inhabitants. And to reach this objective it is in his interest to
<br>
distinguish between combatants (his enemies and targets of attack) and
<br>
non-combatants and their property (to be left out of the war and undamaged).
<br>
Democracy has transformed the limited wars of kings into total wars. The
<br>
motive for war has become ideological - democracy, liberty, civilization,
<br>
humanity. The objectives are intangible and elusive: the ideological
<br>
&quot;conversion&quot; of the losers preceded by their &quot;unconditional&quot; surrender
<br>
(which, because one can never be certain about the sincerity of conversion,
<br>
may require such means as the mass murder of civilians). And the distinction
<br>
between combatants and non-combatants becomes fuzzy and ultimately
<br>
disappears under democracy, and mass war involvement - the draft and popular
<br>
war rallies - as well as &quot;collateral damage&quot; become part of war strategy.
<br>
<p>Myth Three
<br>
<p>Finally, the third myth shattered is the belief that there is no alternative
<br>
to Western welfare-democracies a la US. Again, theory demonstrates
<br>
otherwise. First, this belief is false because the modern welfare-state is
<br>
not a &quot;stable&quot; economic system. It is bound to collapse under its own
<br>
parasitic weight, much like Russian-style socialism imploded a decade ago.
<br>
More importantly, however, an economically stable alternative to democracy
<br>
exists. The term I propose for this alternative is &quot;natural order.&quot;
<br>
<p>In a natural order every scarce resource, including all land, is owned
<br>
privately, every enterprise is funded by voluntarily paying customers or
<br>
private donors, and entry into every line of production, including that of
<br>
property protection, conflict arbitration, and peacemaking, is free. A large
<br>
part of my book concerns the explanation of the workings - the logic - of a
<br>
natural order and the requirements for the transformation from democracy to
<br>
a natural order.
<br>
<p>Whereas states disarm their citizens so as to be able to rob them more
<br>
surely (thereby rendering them more vulnerable also to criminal and
<br>
terrorist attack), a natural order is characterized by an armed citizenry.
<br>
This feature is furthered by insurance companies, which play a prominent
<br>
role as providers of security and protection in a natural order. Insurers
<br>
will encourage gun ownership by offering lower premiums to armed (and
<br>
weapons-trained) clients. By their nature insurers are defensive agencies.
<br>
Only &quot;accidental&quot; - not: self-inflicted, caused or provoked - damage is
<br>
&quot;insurable.&quot; Aggressors and provocateurs will be denied insurance coverage
<br>
and are thus weak. And because insurers must indemnify their clients in case
<br>
of victimization, they must be concerned constantly about the prevention of
<br>
criminal aggression, the recovery of misappropriated property, and the
<br>
apprehension of those liable for the damage in question.
<br>
<p><p>Furthermore, the relationship between insurer and client is contractual. The
<br>
rules of the game are mutually accepted and fixed. An insurer cannot
<br>
&quot;legislate,&quot; or unilaterally change the terms of the contract. In
<br>
particular, if an insurer wants to attract a voluntarily paying clientele,
<br>
it must provide for the foreseeable contingency of conflict in its
<br>
contracts, not only between its own clients but especially with clients of
<br>
other insurers. The only provision satisfactorily covering the latter
<br>
contingency is for an insurer to bind itself contractually to independent
<br>
third-party arbitration. However, not just any arbitration will do. The
<br>
conflicting insurers must agree on the arbitrator or arbitration agency, and
<br>
in order to be agreeable to insurers, an arbitrator must produce a product
<br>
(of legal procedure and substantive judgment) that embodies the widest
<br>
possible moral consensus among insurers and clients alike. Thus, contrary to
<br>
statist conditions, a natural order is characterized by stable and
<br>
predictable law and increased legal harmony.
<br>
<p><p>Moreover, insurance companies promote the development of another &quot;security
<br>
feature.&quot; States have not just disarmed their citizens by taking away their
<br>
weapons, democratic states in particular have also done so in stripping
<br>
their citizens of the right to exclusion and by promoting instead - through
<br>
various non-discrimination, affirmative action, and multiculturalist
<br>
policies - forced integration. In a natural order, the right to exclusion
<br>
inherent in the very idea of private property is restored to private
<br>
property owners.
<br>
<p>Accordingly, to lower the production cost of security and improve its
<br>
quality, a natural order is characterized by increased discrimination,
<br>
segregation, spatial separation, uniculturalism (cultural homogeneity),
<br>
exclusivity, and exclusion. In addition, whereas states have undermined
<br>
intermediating social institutions (family households, churches, covenants,
<br>
communities, and clubs) and the associated ranks and layers of authority so
<br>
as to increase their own power vis-a-vis equal and isolated individuals, a
<br>
natural order is distinctly un-egalitarian: &quot;elitist,&quot; &quot;hierarchical,&quot;
<br>
&quot;proprietarian,&quot; &quot;patriarchical,&quot; and &quot;authoritorian,&quot; and its stability
<br>
depends essentially on the existence of a self-conscious natural -
<br>
voluntarily acknowledged - aristocracy.
<br>
<p><p>Strategy
<br>
<p>Finally, I discuss strategic matters and questions. How can a natural order
<br>
arise out of democracy? I explain the role of ideas, intellectuals, elites,
<br>
and public opinion in the legitimation and de-legitimation of state power.
<br>
In particular, I discuss the role of secession - and the proliferation of
<br>
independent political entities - as an important step toward the goal of
<br>
natural order, and I explain how to properly privatize &quot;socialized&quot; and
<br>
&quot;public&quot; property.
<br>
<p>The book grew out of speeches I presented at various Mises Institute and CLS
<br>
conferences during the 1990s. These conferences, organized by Lew Rockwell,
<br>
Burt Blumert, and, until his death in 1995, Murray Rothbard, had the purpose
<br>
of advancing libertarianism by locating and anchoring abstract libertarian
<br>
theory historically, sociologically, and culturally and thereby creating
<br>
what has become known in the meantime as paleo-libertarianism (in contrast
<br>
to left-countercultural-libertarianism and cold-and-hot-war &quot;new&quot; and
<br>
&quot;neo&quot;-conservatism). The Rothbard-Rockwell Report, the precusor to LRC, was
<br>
the first and most immediate expression and reflection of this intellectual
<br>
movement. Others included The Costs of War, Reassessing the Presidency, and
<br>
<p>The Irrepressible Rothbard. Democracy the God That Failed is my attempt to
<br>
define and give expression to the paleo-libertarian movement.
