<p>That site is so over-engineered it borders on unusable at times (IMHO).

<p>The problems is even though many extropians like to think of
<br>
themselves as early-adopters and flexible, we really aren't.
<br>
Most people on the list are comfortable with email format.
<br>
The people that can't deal with the volume (those that would
<br>
perhaps like a /. interface) simply aren't on the list --
<br>
once you lose them its difficult to get them back.
<br>
<p>I regularly peruse /. and nanodot and post less to them than
<br>
to the extropian list because the overhead is higher.  The
<br>
same was true with javien forums (though the conversation
<br>
sorting made it a very appealing in some ways).  One thing
<br>
that email has above /.  is a relatively &quot;real time&quot;
<br>
interface and ease of following &quot;conversations&quot;.  To
<br>
get that with /. you have to install a headline scroller.
<br>
The last time I looked into this it looked more than a
<br>
little difficult.  If we wanted to try /. again, one
<br>
of the essential components should be distributions of
<br>
headline scrollers that worked on Windows, Linux &amp; perhaps
<br>
the Mac.
<br>
<p>What is needed is an integration of /. and mailing lists
<br>
with an visual interface that can be switched between a
<br>
/. view and a forum view.
<br>
<p>I think it is rumored that some of the integration between /. and
<br>
mailing lists may become available in the next release of the /. code.
