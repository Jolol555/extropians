<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Antiamericanism has a *long* tradition in Europe by now, and is firmly

</em><br>
<em>&gt;     left, but there is enough cultural friction even without it to keep it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     going indefinitely.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am well-aware of this tendency in the Euro presses, and, like I had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned in my previous post, also cynical and paranoid myself. I cast 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stones, realizing my own lackings. Yet, I also think the United States need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be a victim of someone else's propaganda. We have our own dead to bury, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and our own interests to pursue.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. I am very much on the anti-anti-americanism side here. We have
<br>
no use for silly prejudices when we can dislike each other for what we
<br>
actually do :-) Another reason to fear the anti-americanism meme is that
<br>
is has become tied to quite a few other memes I seriously dislike,
<br>
ranging from assorted leftisms to anti-rationalism and a romantic view
<br>
of nature.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;But there is a long intellectual history
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of lambasting the US for everything bad. The right did it too (and of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     course attacked the Soviet Union even more), the left toned down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Soviet criticism and wholeheartedly criticized the US for everything it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     did. This has deeply influenced media (you would be surprised how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     newspaper articles in Sweden mainly dwell on the bad sides of US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     society), and of course percolated into society. If you ask most Swedes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I think they assume that self interest, disregarding the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     world, is a primary motivator for all US foreign policy.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is merely vilianization, without facts, is it not, or being able to put 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters in perspective, at the least?
</em><br>
<p>If you mainly report about the bad sides of the US in media, then
<br>
people's perceptions of the US will become biased. Why do we get
<br>
negative reports and fewer about the good stuff? Because 1) the
<br>
journalists have very noticeable left leanings, 2) because the editors
<br>
select articles that fit their worldview back in Sweden, so if a
<br>
journalist in the US sends unbiased reports they get biased by selection
<br>
and 3) the general meme that the powerful should be scrutinized more
<br>
closely. It is not anything as crude as saying the US is evil, instead
<br>
it is pervasive: more reports about soup kitchens and eccentric
<br>
billionaires than reports about people creating their own lives, more
<br>
reports about environmental problems in the big cities than reports
<br>
about solving them, and so on. The end result is a negative image, and
<br>
it is strong: a friend of mine is firmly anti-american and it is
<br>
reinforced each time he visits, because what he sees get slotted into
<br>
his preconceptions and what doesn't fit gets ignored. At the end of his
<br>
trip all his prejudices have been reinforced. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;And remember - we are your *allies*. Now think about the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     world. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not to be a total dick, but during WW2 Sweden was a neutral. ;-) Also during 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cold war.  :o(    Heeeeeeey!!!!
</em><br>
<p>Actually (to get things straight, rather than defend the country) Sweden
<br>
was secretly allied during the cold war and did quite a bit of signal
<br>
scanning for NATO - while the government orated to the public about the
<br>
fine neutrality we held. Hypocricy anyone?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;It is also interesting to think about the current situation reflected in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a world where China has emerged as an economic superpower sometime in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the 2010-2020 region (you know, the time where so much dangerous nano is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     expected to be developed). Will anti-americanism still be a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     motivator by then? &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. We'll see if China really emerges as an economic super-power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. We'll see if nanotech emerges as powerfully as hoped for.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But in a world where there is enormous suspicion and paranoia
<br>
regarding the US, the situation might become dangerous if some new major
<br>
power emerges (be it China, India or (rather unlikely) EU) without
<br>
resolving both this widespread anti-americanism and american myopia.
