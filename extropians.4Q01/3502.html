<em>&gt; It's worth thinking about this from the viewpoint of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realpolitik/raison d'etat. If people attack you you need to know what their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beef is so you can calculate the relative cost of 1. Killing them, 2. giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them what they want 3. giving them some of what they want but making it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear that's all they're going to get. If giving your enemy what they want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is too costly (a threat to some vital interest or the existence of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state) then you accept the cost of killing them. If the cost balance works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the other way you make a deal - this is what the British government has
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&quot;Realpolitik&quot; is what got us into this mess in the first place.
<br>
&quot;Realpolitik&quot; is what people call shortsightedness when they wish to think
<br>
of themselves as being clever.
<br>
<p>If you give terrorists what they want, you end up with more terrorists. 
<br>
Appeasement.  Danegeld.  Basic rule of supply and demand.
<br>
<p>You can't calculate for the single, local, present issue, without taking
<br>
into account the effect on future issues.  &quot;Realpolitik&quot; means not taking
<br>
into account what happens on the next pass; the effect that your violation
<br>
of principle (for realpolitik is never invoked except where principles are
<br>
being violated) will have on future dealings with the other nations who
<br>
stood by and watched you betray, meddle, appease, or whatever it is you
<br>
were doing under the banner of &quot;realpolitik&quot;.
<br>
<p>The foundation of ethics is the iterated Prisoner's Dilemna, and those who
<br>
wish to try and excuse ethical violations will generally analyze only the
<br>
single, local round.  They don't argue explicitly that there is just the
<br>
single round, rather they simply don't analyze anything else in their
<br>
argument.
