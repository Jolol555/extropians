<em>&gt; Yes, his Phantoms in the Brain is an interesting read. Very breezy style
</em><br>
too. Actually, I'm typing from his lab right now. I work here. He's currently
<br>
interested in synesthesia and the relationship between thought and language.
<br>
<p>Lucky you! What do I have to do to get a job there?
<br>
Since I'm unemployed...
<br>
guess I'll just sit here in the lingering warmth of Autumn's glowing
<br>
sunshine...
<br>
and think about:

What would you say about a woman who, despite stroke-induced paralysis
<br>
crippling the entire left side of her body, insists that she is whole and
<br>
strong--who even sees her left hand reach out to grasp objects? Freud called
<br>
it &quot;denial&quot;; neurologists call it &quot;anosognosia.&quot; However it may be labeled,
<br>
this phenomenon and others like it allow us peeks into other mental worlds and
<br>
afford us considerable insight into our own.
<br>
The writings of Oliver Sacks and others have shown us that we can learn much
<br>
about ourselves by looking closely at the deficits shown by people with
<br>
neurological problems. V.S. Ramachandran has seen countless patients suffering
<br>
from anosognosia, phantom limb pain, blindsight, and other disorders, and he
<br>
brings a remarkable mixture of clinical intuition and research savvy to bear
<br>
on their problems. He is one of the few scientists who are able and willing to
<br>
explore the personal, subjective ramifications of his work; he rehumanizes an
<br>
often too-sterile field and captures the spirit of wonder so essential for
<br>
true discovery. Phantoms in the Brain is equal parts medical mystery,
<br>
scientific adventure, and philosophical speculation; Ramachandran's writing is
<br>
smart, caring, and very, very funny.
<br>
Whether you're curious about the workings of the brain, interested in
<br>
alternatives to expensive, high-tech science (much of Ramachandran's research
<br>
is done with materials found around the home), or simply want a fresh
<br>
perspective on the nature of human consciousness, you'll find satisfaction
<br>
with Phantoms in the Brain. --Rob Lightner

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
