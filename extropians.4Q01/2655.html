<p>
nope
<br>
<p><p>loosely-organised militia originally made up of scholars versus a very 
<br>
very experienced army which has pretty much defended it's soil against 
<br>
all comers.  As far as I am aware the Soviets never took the Panshir 
<br>
valley, for example.
<br>
<p>No secondary front, no defense in depth, no clue. The NA broke through 
<br>
the front line, everything collapsed, no military discipline so everyone 
<br>
just fled, kapow the entire region collapses.
<br>
<p>When you think about who is doing the fighting, it seems reasonably 
<br>
obvious to me.
<br>
<p>BTW, anyone who can get US and Euro news noticed the american news 
<br>
services (specifically CNN which we get here) going on and on about 
<br>
&quot;fears of bloodbath, massacre in Kabul&quot; versus Sky News (UK) &quot;Kabul 
<br>
residents ecstatic at their liberation&quot; ???
<br>
<p>Interesting when you compare that with Dr Abdullah's outburst the night 
<br>
before they entered Kabul about Pakistani propaganda, if you assume the 
<br>
US has been listening to Pakistan.....
