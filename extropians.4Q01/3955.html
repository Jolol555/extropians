&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 52'nd update of my fly longevity experiments. All bottles
<br>
contain 1/4 tsp citric acid as a standard additive. Recorded average
<br>
temperature during the experiment was 25.7 C.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this experiment I used a newer breeding bottle, that I would
<br>
expect to be less infected, as well as have fewer older flies. To no great
<br>
surprise control survival was much better than with the last run.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policosanol is a supplement used in very small doses in humans to
<br>
protect against cardiovascular disease. However in aged humans a reduced
<br>
cholesterol is associated with a lowered immunity. Although there is no
<br>
proof that policosanol has any adverse effect on human immunity at
<br>
recommended doses, the current results indicate that overindulging in this
<br>
supplement may be counterproductive. A human consuming the fly food in
<br>
this experiments would ingest about 200 mg of policosanol per day.
<br>
Recommended dosage is 5 to 10 mg/day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanilla proved to be quite toxic, but peppers improved average
<br>
survival, presumably due to an antiviral effect. The surprisingly poor
<br>
maximum longevity with black pepper I attribute to neurotoxicity. Activity
<br>
levels were greatly increased in black pepper exposed flies, and to a much
<br>
lower extent with cayenne pepper.
