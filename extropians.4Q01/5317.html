</em><br>
<p>I was not arguing against using such models per se, but arguing against
<br>
using irrelevant models.  That why I stated and repeat:  &quot;You can make
<br>
up fantasy worlds that fit any claim you want to make.  Does your model
<br>
capture anything relevant about reality?&quot;  (Note: I did not make a
<br>
blanket statement against using such models or imaginary worlds.)  What
<br>
I want to avoid is just created some abstract model that supports a
<br>
given position, but is extremely unrealistic.  If your model does
<br>
capture relevant features of the real world, that's great.  If it
<br>
doesn't, then it can lead to trouble.  What sort of trouble?  Leaving
<br>
out important facts, such as when people look at exponential growth in
<br>
bacteria but forget that the agar base is limited, so eventually growth
<br>
drops off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, can you give valid historical evidence of the beneficial effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the absence of a government on social development (I mean *total*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absence of a government resulting in great improvements in quality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantity of human life)?
</em><br>
<p>The examples already given qualify, but to these I would add some
<br>
extrapolation from other historical examples of less anarchistic
<br>
societies, but ones where government is either less interventionist or
<br>
in which the level of intervention has declined marketedly.  Examples of
<br>
this include Late Middle Ages Northern Europe, the British Colonies in
<br>
the New World, and the United States before the Civil War.  I would also
<br>
add to these examples of free markets or of deregulation (carried out
<br>
correctly -- i.e., with the moral hazard problem creared by halfbaked
<br>
deregulation).
<br>
<p>Overall, these exampels seem to point out the societies that have less
<br>
government interference are better off.  They create more wealth and
<br>
have more technological progress.  Now, a counterargument to this could
<br>
be that there's a certain level of government needed -- more than
<br>
anarchy, but less than a modern welfare state.  Some, like Rand and von
<br>
Mises, defend just this claim.  However, absent any evidence or good
<br>
theoretical arguments for a lower limit on government, I think it
<br>
bolsters the claim for anarchism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Taxes are coercive.  Elections are coercive.  You model already has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; coercion built into it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK - you made my day.
</em><br>
<p>I have to nit pick.  You do and will.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's say the colonists just arrive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haphazardly from other planets, in small groups, like the Native
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans, Polynesians, Easter Islanders. With no constabulary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals with a penchant for rape and pillage will inevitably act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A tribal warfare system will inevitably develop (or can you give me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical counterexamples?)
</em><br>
<p>Only the ones I gave you earlier.  Also, by having different groups with
<br>
vastly different cultures arrive, you're tilting your example toward
<br>
cultural clashes.  Surely, this stuff does happen, but the usual
<br>
solution is that different peoples tend to stick together and not
<br>
intermingle -- except at the boundaries and even then only in a
<br>
controlled fashion.  This seems to fit anthropological evidence and even
<br>
modern experience, where we see immigrants -- surprise! -- settling in
<br>
immigrant communities in the US even now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Another unrealistic assumption.  I'd expect some industry to arise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; technological progress -- unless there were strict controls against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How many thousands of years did take to invent the wheel (counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the first emergence of ungoverned humans)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A government (usually a bad one) will form well before industry, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without stability offered by a good government, hardly any research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will take place.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  Fire and probably metallurgy were discoverd long
<br>
before nation states came onto the scene.  Probably the same for pottery
<br>
and many small scale manufacturing.  Add to this, that governments
<br>
created much of the instability, through invasion and occupation and
<br>
even wholesale slaughter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Coercion always comes first - government comes later. This played
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out in hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies hundreds of times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (again, Native Americans, Polynesians......)
</em><br>
<p>Is your argument that coercion comes, then as a reaction to it, people
<br>
form governments -- institutions for coercion -- to stop it?  If so, my
<br>
argument would be that government is not necessary to do this.  I
<br>
believe a competitive, market solution is much better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This is unlikely for many reasons.  One, as more land gets bought up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the incentive for people to band together against further buying up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will increase.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you mean exactly? Communes putting together their monies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to buy land from the rich? Where on Earth did they form (aside from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those insignificant credit unions)?
</em><br>
<p>On your parenthetic comment: if credit unions are so insignificant, why
<br>
are banks worried about them?  Why do banks lobby to have credit unions
<br>
severely restricted?  (On the wider issue of unconventional banking, the
<br>
Third World and many people in poor communities in the First World use
<br>
sort of lending coops to help each other out.  This people helping
<br>
themselves out -- as opposed to the state taxing someone else to help
<br>
them.  This is just the sort of thing you rule out in your model, yet
<br>
it's a real phenomena.  Now, you might rule it out because it's rare or
<br>
unlikely to stem the tide of buy outs, but then tell me why.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Such cooperation happens &quot;spontaneously&quot; in many instances --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from small businesses helping each other out to various corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (why wouldn't landowners just hire the right people to manage their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; land for them and run it like a corporation?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Precisely what types of &quot;small businesses&quot; are going to help each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other out, trying to stop land consolidation and how?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Landowners do - they hire accountants, overseers, and hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peons to do the work, if such laboreres are available due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scarcity of land.
</em><br>
<p>But what about the overall context of this?  If the peons they are
<br>
hiring are getting paid, then there's always a chance they can put aside
<br>
money or such to buy land themselves.  (Insider trading might occur too,
<br>
here.  It might be unethical, but it probably will occur.)
<br>
<p>Also, if the wealthy landowners in your model compete with each other,
<br>
then the price of land will also rise as will the price of their
<br>
laborers.  (This is why subsistence wages probably won't be the rule.)
<br>
Unless you posit some sort of class consciousness for the wealthier
<br>
landowners -- and if you do, how does it arise (since in your original
<br>
model everyone starts out the same) and how does it perpetuate itself
<br>
(as consolidation proceeds, the profit to be made by compete against
<br>
each other will rise plus) -- there wil lbe no reason to expect a two
<br>
class system of everyone else and big landowners.  (On the perpetuation
<br>
issue, imagine this.  As you say, all the landowners want to increase
<br>
their shares.  Some are better than others.  X, e.g., is the best in
<br>
area A, while Y is the best in area B.  When X buys up all of A and Y
<br>
buys up all of B, as you assume, why wouldn't X and Y compete with each
<br>
other?  Why wouldn't one or the other attempt to buy each other out?
<br>
Why would they stop only at that moment and not before or after?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; and other contractual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; agreements to ward off mergers and the like.  (Sometimes, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; inefficient to do so, but beforehand, we can't always be sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; voluntary behavior is inefficient or that coerced behavior can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; better.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who is going to ward off mergers??? Why? How?
</em><br>
<p>A contractual agreement could arise under private property where a group
<br>
of farmers agree to a convenant not to sell off their land.  This is a
<br>
restriction on their property right, but one they agree to.  (This
<br>
happens today with neighborhood convenants -- e.g., where people agree
<br>
only to sell their property if their neighbors agree to the sale or
<br>
where people voluntarily restrict the uses to which their property can
<br>
be put, such as disallowing commercial or nuisance uses.  There are even
<br>
planned communities where this is carried out to a further degree.)
<br>
<p>Why would people do this?  It's often for cultural or property value
<br>
maintenance.  In the former case, people want to live in certain
<br>
settings.  In your example, it's quite possible to imagine yoemen
<br>
farmers who decide that 100 acre farms are the ideal and anything bigger
<br>
will destroy this sort of Jeffersonian culture of self-sufficiency.
<br>
(I'm not saying the whole planet would adopt this.)
<br>
<p>In the latter case, sometimes property values are best maintained when
<br>
property is not split, combined, or put to different uses.  For
<br>
instance, many people want to live in residential and not industrial or
<br>
commercial neighborhoods and will pay more to do so.  One property near
<br>
them becomes industrialized or commercialized -- e.g., a factory gets
<br>
built -- the property value goes down.  So, people form agreements to
<br>
limit or prevent this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We agreed there is no coercion allowed in this experiment, so you
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; have to be pretty smart, trying to stop landowners from consolidating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their holdings by marriage.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  This would depend on what marriage entailed.  All of this
<br>
has to do with the culture and what people agree to.  Right now, there
<br>
are prenuptial agreements in the US and in earlier cultures there were
<br>
rights on how properties were divided under marriage and inheritence.
<br>
The English has primogeniture and the Germans had equal division --
<br>
IIRC.  (I'm not sure if these still prevail, but it's beside the point
<br>
here.  After all, marriage does not necessarily entail consolidation and
<br>
there can be other agreements that override it.  For instance, the owner
<br>
might only allow land to pass on if it's kept whole but not consolidated
<br>
with other land.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Two, land will go up in value if some want to buy more and more of
</em><br>
it.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The price will rise, meaning that owners of it will make more money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There's no way to tell how much, but this already shows how your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; scenario is a bit unrealistic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are forgetting that the large landowners make more money than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the small ones, both gross, and sometimes even per acre (they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afford the expensive, imported machines). The less land available for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sale there is, the more difficult it is for the small operators to
</em><br>
join the
<br>
<em>&gt; game.
</em><br>
<p>Still, as supply decreases, all other things being equal, price will
<br>
rise.  This might mean in your model that latter sellers make more
<br>
money -- in fact, maybe enough to not turn into subsistence workers for
<br>
big landowners.  This will create an incentive to hold out.
<br>
<p>Let's look at this realistically.  In any such society, there will be
<br>
incompetent landowners -- for whatever reason -- and unlucky ones.
<br>
There will be highly competent ones and very lucky ones -- the guy get
<br>
the best top soil even if his farming practices leave something to be
<br>
desired.  But there will also be the vast middle grade in between.  The
<br>
inefficient landowners probably should get bought up and find something
<br>
else to do.  The ones in the middle will always have a chance to be
<br>
among the buyers (driving up the prices for the big guys) or to plan
<br>
ahead, since their fortunes are not so marginal.  Unless you assume from
<br>
the start there are only good morons and evil geniuses -- yet with both
<br>
groups deciding to abide by libertarianism -- your model probably won't
<br>
come about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Three, you assume that inheritance alone will preserve large estates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Historically, this has not been the case.  In fact, inherited wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; often declines after a time.  Surely, there are exceptions, but even
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; biggest family fortunes tend to get consumed over time and less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; entrepreneurial and frugal family members take over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Historically, that *was* the case, at least in countries with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primogeniture (or can you give me specific and numerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterexamples?).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, from my reading this was _the_ problem in the Frankish
<br>
kingdoms, where land was divided equally among male offspring.  What
<br>
happened was big estates eventually were broken into ever smaller
<br>
ones -- a process helped by other social processes going on in the early
<br>
Middle Ages.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;From rags to rags in three generations&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is mainly a phenomenon of the capitalist society, where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to be on your toes to stay on top.
</em><br>
<p>But, by construction, the society you're talking about is capitalist.
<br>
It has a free market, respect for property rights, and initiation of
<br>
force is a no no.  Also, the process of accumulation in your model is
<br>
supposed to be that the people on their toes stay on top.  If this is
<br>
so -- and how is this any different from other models of capitalism in
<br>
action -- why would one expect vast estates to only grow and never
<br>
decline?  How could one guarantee that a guy who is competent would pass
<br>
that competence along to his heirs?  How could one also expect a guy who
<br>
is competent at running a 100 acre farm will be equally competent at
<br>
running a million acre one?  How could one expect that a guy who is
<br>
competent today will still be competent tomorrow and vice versa?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This process, the concentration of a crucial and non-expandable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Land actually is expandable in many ways.  One, land that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; formerly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; marginal can become profitable if it's physically altered, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cleared, irrigated, and plowed.  Two, if the price of land increases
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; overall, then more marginal pieces will be economically usable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Three, land can be created in the sense of reclaiming land from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the sea or even building islands.  Four, things like agriskyscrapers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; could create new land on top of old land -- if they became
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; economical.  We can't just assume static amounts and values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is orthogonal to the issue of land concentration - land is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanded only if there is population pressure,
</em><br>
<p>Wrong!  Land is expanded when it becomes economical to do so -- or, even
<br>
more accurately, when some people think it will be economical to do so.
<br>
(Entrepreneurial action is based on perceptions and expectations -- not
<br>
necessarily underlying realities.  That's why some projects fails.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with total demand for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food exceeding the supply. It does not result in an unlimited supply
</em><br>
of
<br>
<p>Note: I never said unlimited.  I merely said we can &quot;assume static
<br>
amounts and values.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; land at competitive prices - entrepreneurs cannot make money by
</em><br>
offering
<br>
<em>&gt; cheap &quot;land&quot; in skyscrapers to undercut the traditional landowners
</em><br>
<p>They can if it becomes profitable to do so.  Right now, it is not
<br>
profitable to do so -- or no one has found a way to make it so.  (After
<br>
all, the price of land could rise to make other methods more profitable
<br>
or the cost of other methods -- even formerly unknown ones -- could
<br>
decrease, or some combination of the two could come about.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to memory chip makers being able to flood the market with
</em><br>
every
<br>
<em>&gt; new advance in technology). Marginal land sometimes offers a refuge
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; subsistence farmers, but with enough pressure even they might end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being displaced.
</em><br>
<p>This is only your assumption here.  There are also other things to do
<br>
with land aside from farm it.  Unless you assume only farming is allowed
<br>
and that no one can find other profitable uses for land, then your model
<br>
has other flaws in it.
<br>
<p>In essence, if you make a model with enough assumptions in it -- however
<br>
unrealistic or unlikely they may be -- you can get just about anything
<br>
you want.  This is how, e.g., we get Keynesian economics.  (For
<br>
criticisms of Keynesian macroeconomic models, see Roger Garrison's _Time
<br>
and Money: The Macroeconomics of Capital Structure_.  I specifically
<br>
brought up Adam Smith's corn economy as such a model.  Granted, Smith's
<br>
model is not all that bad, but when taken too seriously, it can lead to
<br>
results we never see in real world economies, even in farm economies.
<br>
He abstracted away from the richness of real world economies.  From
<br>
this, Marx was basically able to build his highly unrealistic model of
<br>
capitalism, which is very close to your model.  That's why I brought
<br>
this up earlier.)
<br>
<p>This is a wider point that applies outside of the discussion of free
<br>
markets and libertarianism to many other topics discussed on this list,
<br>
including various singularities.  How many projections of when it will
<br>
occur suffer from unrealistic modeling techniques?
<br>
