<br>
<em>&gt; Maybe the reason that so many men are in jail (vs. women) has something to
</em><br>
do with the makeup of juries, the kind of persons making arrests, the majority
<br>
controlling what laws are passed, and the people who own the country.
<br>
<p>Those are all excellent points, Phil.
<br>
But I still think that the disproportionate number of male convicts is an
<br>
indication of sex differences. Don't forget that the justice and prison
<br>
systems were built by men.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My understanding is that juries tend to be dominated by women.  Most
</em><br>
arresting officers are men, who have shown a marked disinclination to arrest
<br>
women (note my prior remarks re spousal abuse, e.g., the arrest rate of women
<br>
jumping from zero to 20% when they began putting female officers on the
<br>
investigations).
<br>
<p>Yes indeed, anti-male discrimination is ubiquitous. In fact, it's so pervasive
<br>
that most people never even see it, because it's taken for granted. Men think
<br>
it's normal to dislike men, and so do their sisters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Next, 60% of the votes cast in the U.S. are by women, who can thus
</em><br>
reasonably be held accountable for the U.S. not just arresting so many more
<br>
men, but in general arresting and incarcerating more people per capita than
<br>
any other nation in the world, past or present.  Then, according to the Feds,
<br>
women own 70% of the real property and make 85% (!) of the consumer purchases,
<br>
not mention living about 13% longer than men in the U.S.
<br>
<p>Yes, but despite the fact that womyn dominate economically and legally, and
<br>
despite enormous social programs to advance females, men still manage to
<br>
become presidents and CEOs of most US corporations. That's because when
<br>
measuring performance objectively, men outperform females in every area of
<br>
endeavor which requires creativity, originality, productivity, and acquired
<br>
skill.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't be fooled.  Women run and own the U.S. and have for many decades.  Men
</em><br>
are and have been 2nd class citizens, with far fewer benefits or safety nets
<br>
provided, so it should not be any surprise to see them dominating the prison
<br>
stats.
<br>
<p>I think the way it works is that men are represented at the extremes of
<br>
cognitive ability more than are females. For example, although there are more
<br>
male morons than female morons, there are also more male geniuses than female
<br>
geniuses. Likewise, there are more male criminals than female criminals, but
<br>
there are also more male community leaders than female ones. I guess there's
<br>
just more diversity and variability in the male than in the female of the
<br>
species. That may also explain why men rather than womyn first became buddhas.
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
