PLEASE GIVE US YOUR FEEDBACK
<br>
<p>A number of extropians have come together to pursue an unprecedented 
<br>
reworking and rejuvenation of Extropy Institute. We are improving 
<br>
organizational structure, improving processes to encourage progress in 
<br>
numerous projects, and opening up to wider involvement.
<br>
<p>This message and survey is an attempt to serve you, fellow transhumanists, 
<br>
better. Our community would benefit from a more vigorous, resource-rich, 
<br>
and active Extropy Institute. We would like to know what prevents many of 
<br>
you from getting involved. &quot;Involved&quot; can mean becoming a member and/or 
<br>
contributing financially to the survival and growth of ExI, or contributing 
<br>
talent and energy to furthering one of ExI's projects. (Many of these were 
<br>
listed in the issue of Exponent that went out last Sunday.)
<br>
<p>If you are already a member or if you already contribute financially or 
<br>
with skills, please take the questions as asking what would spur you to do 
<br>
even more.
<br>
<p>Q U E S T I O N S:
<br>
<p>-- If you have not become a full member of Extropy Institute or contributed 
<br>
in some other significant way, what would spur you to want to do this?
<br>
<p>-- Does Extropy Institute do anything that discourages you from joining and 
<br>
contributing?
<br>
<p>-- What does Extropy Institute not do, to your knowledge, that you think 
<br>
would be valuable to the extropian transhumanist community and which would 
<br>
induce you to join and contribute?
<br>
<p>-- What does Extropy Institute do that you find worthwhile, but which you 
<br>
think could be done much better? (Bonus question: Do you have ideas about 
<br>
*how* it could be done better?)
<br>
<p>-- If you really *do* want to join or contribute in some way, but haven't 
<br>
gotten around to it, what is holding you back?
<br>
<p><p>Please send your responses to me at &lt;<a href="mailto:max@maxmore.com?Subject=Re:%20EXI:%20What%20can%20we%20do%20for%20you?&In-Reply-To=&lt;5.1.0.14.2.20011212234811.034c2ec0@mail.speakeasy.net&gt;">max@maxmore.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>I will share the results with the Extropians list (without names, unless 
<br>
you ask that your name be mentioned with your views) if or when enough 
<br>
responses are in.
<br>
<p>Be direct, bold, and hold nothing back. The goal is to elicit productive 
<br>
feedback so we can continue to improve Extropy Institute.
<br>
<p>(If anyone has critical comments that are specifically about me and would 
<br>
rather I not get them, please send them to E. Shaun and he will pass them 
<br>
on minus the names. I will not ask!)
<br>
<p>This is a vital time for ExI to function as a healthy, vigorous, and 
<br>
influential organization. The rate of technological change continues to 
<br>
accelerate. The forces of conservatism, resistance and regulation are also 
<br>
growing. Issues requiring carefully thought out transhumanist positions and 
<br>
responses, dealing with potential problems and resistance are increasingly 
<br>
thrusting their way into public discussion. We need you! Tell us how to 
<br>
please you.
<br>
<p>Onward!
<br>
