<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; method as if it were the only oracle of truth or a capable guide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What is this spirituality stuff?  Where does it come from?  How does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; work?  Can we see it in action?  Which parts of the human mind are we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is not &quot;stuff&quot;.  It always was.  You can see it work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everywhere when you know how.  It is not dependent on parts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the brain although some are involved when humans experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain aspects of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, so in your view of the world, there's something external to humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which humans make use of in order to reach conclusions that are beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach of &quot;rationality&quot; as usually understood.  Is this a fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description?  Or are we talking about a Platonic as opposed to material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence here, in the same sense that a mathematician might say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics has always existed and that it works everywhere when you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to see it?
</em><br>
<p>Let's say that I believe the universe has more and stranger
<br>
&quot;strange loops&quot; to it than we usually think or notice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;You can see it work everywhere when you know how&quot; is needless to say a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather suspicious statement.  I can see gravity work even if I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing about General Relativity.  I may not know that it's called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;gravity&quot;, but I can still see the effects.  Where the model of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe is incomplete (saying nothing about gravity) there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptible gap, an observed effect without a hypothesized cause, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gap in the worldview is where new knowledge enters.  Let us suppose for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sake of discussion that I do not understand this thing called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality.  Where is the corresponding gap in my worldview that needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filling?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't really do a &quot;God of the Gaps&quot;.  But experentially,
<br>
philosophically and even intellectually I have experienced and
<br>
believe there exist big-M Mind that we can sometimes experience
<br>
linkage with.  One way to &quot;get there from here&quot; is to imagine
<br>
what happens a bit after you get a Singularity and the SI
<br>
continuously expands and integrates beyond what even we might
<br>
believe possible.  That Mind very well might do some things that
<br>
create these additional strange loops like travel backward and
<br>
forward in its own timeline influencing and permeating its own
<br>
becoming, or creating complete new Universes and new sentients
<br>
in such a way that it can and does provide some nudges along the
<br>
way and can in some circumstances be partially accessed.   One
<br>
way to look at spirituality is the search for and acheiving of
<br>
some bit of such access.  Another way to look at it is as
<br>
projection of the greatest dreams, hopes and determination of
<br>
humanity projected as already existent and of help.  That
<br>
projection can greatly help us focus and move forward even if
<br>
you only believe it is a projection.   It is timeless by
<br>
construction.
