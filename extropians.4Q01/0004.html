<br>
<p>Spike, you apparently have only a vague idea of how restrictive firearm laws
<br>
have become in Kali.  &quot;Everything up to but not including an M60&quot; is not
<br>
even close -- if you want those or anything even vaguely of that capability,
<br>
go next door to Nevada or Arizona.  You aren't even allowed to transport a
<br>
firearm except under very specific proscribed circumstances.  Taking your
<br>
rifle out on the front lawn can get you arrested, whether you shoot it or
<br>
not.  You may not have to worry about being busted during an attack, but it
<br>
stands as an issue the rest of the time.  In fact, if you own a firearm in
<br>
Kalifornia, there is a reasonably high probability that you are occasionally
<br>
(or routinely) breaking the law and don't even know it there are so many
<br>
restrictions and absurd rules.  They also selectively enforce many of them
<br>
unless the DA wants to nail you with a felony, which leads people to think
<br>
what they are doing is legal even if it technically is not because they've
<br>
never heard of people getting busted for it.  They add new rules all the
<br>
time, often with little or no notice, so it is difficult to keep track of as
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>Other than a few older semi-auto systems that aren't really cut out for this
<br>
type of work, you are pretty much stuck with bolt action systems these days
<br>
in Kalifornia.  There are certain exceptions to this, but they are so
<br>
cumbersome that they aren't even worth it IMO.  Your defensive options
<br>
aren't non-existent in Kali, but they are extremely limited for all
<br>
practical purposes.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, you could drive a few hours to Nevada, where anyone with
<br>
money and a non-felonious past could legally purchase and install a
<br>
surface-to-air missile battery in their backyard.  But then, terrorists have
<br>
never been interested in Nevada (no targets, among other reasons).
