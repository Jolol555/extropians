<br>
<em>&gt; I know all I need to know about Bin Ladens motives, when he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroyed he will be out of motives.
</em><br>
<p>The same might be said about religiosity in general.
<br>
Here's what Richard Dawkins has to say about it.
<br>
(It's a bit lengthy, but worth it.)
<br>
<p>&quot;   How can I say that religion is to blame? Do I really imagine
<br>
that, when a terrorist kills, he is motivated by a theological
<br>
disagreement with his victim?  Do I really think the Northern Ireland
<br>
pub bomber says to himself &quot;Take that, Tridentine
<br>
Transubstantiationist bastards!&quot;
<br>
Of course I don't think anything of the kind. Theology is the last
<br>
thing on the minds of such people. They are not killing because of
<br>
religion itself, but because of political grievances, often
<br>
justified. They are killing because the other lot killed their
<br>
fathers. Or because the other lot drove their great grandfathers off
<br>
their land. Or because the other lot oppressed our lot economically
<br>
for centuries.
<br>
<p>My point is not that religion itself  is the motivation for wars,
<br>
murders and terrorist attacks, but that religion is the principal
<br>
LABEL, and the most dangerous one, by which a &quot;they&quot; as opposed to
<br>
a &quot;we&quot; can be identified at all. I am not even claiming that religion
<br>
is the only label by which we identify the victims of our prejudice.
<br>
There's also skin colour, language, and social class. But often, as
<br>
in Northern Ireland, these don't apply and religion is the only
<br>
divisive label around. Even when it is not alone, religion is nearly
<br>
always an incendiary ingredient in the mix as well. And please don't
<br>
trot out Hitler as a counter-example. Hitler's sub-Wagnerian ravings
<br>
constituted a religion of his own foundation, and his anti-Semitism
<br>
owed a lot to his never-renounced Roman Catholicism .
<br>
<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that religion is the most
<br>
inflammatory enemy-labelling device in history. Who killed your
<br>
father?  Not the individuals you are about to kill in `revenge'. The
<br>
culprits themselves have vanished over the border. The people who
<br>
stole your great grandfather's land have died of old age. You aim
<br>
your vendetta at those who belong to the same religion as the
<br>
original perpetrators. It wasn't Seamus who killed your brother, but
<br>
it was Catholics, so Seamus deserves to die &quot;in return&quot;. Next, it was
<br>
Protestants who killed Seamus so let's go out and kill some
<br>
Protestants &quot;in revenge&quot;. It was Muslims who destroyed the World
<br>
Trade Center so let's set upon the turbaned driver of a London taxi
<br>
and leave him paralysed from the neck down.
<br>
<p>The bitter hatreds that now poison Middle Eastern politics are rooted
<br>
in the real or perceived wrong of the setting up of a Jewish State in
<br>
an Islamic region. In view of all that the Jews had been through, it
<br>
must have seemed a fair and humane solution. Probably deep
<br>
familiarity with the Old Testament had given the European and
<br>
American decision-makers some sort of idea that this really was
<br>
the `historic homeland' of the Jews (though the horrific stories of
<br>
how Joshua and others conquered their Lebensraum might have made them
<br>
wonder). Even if it wasn't justifiable at the time, no doubt a good
<br>
case can be made that, since Israel exists now, to try to reverse the
<br>
status quo would be a worse wrong.
<br>
<p>I do not intend to get into that argument. But if it had not been for
<br>
religion, the very concept of a Jewish state would have had no
<br>
meaning in the first place. Nor would the very concept of Islamic
<br>
lands, as something to be invaded and desecrated. In a world without
<br>
religion, there would have been no Crusades; no Inquisition; no anti-
<br>
Semitic pogroms (the people of the diaspora would long ago have
<br>
intermarried and become indistinguishable from their host
<br>
populations); no Northern Ireland Troubles (no label by which to
<br>
distinguish the two `communities', and no sectarian schools to teach
<br>
the children historic hatreds  -  they would simply be one community).
<br>
<p>Parenthetically, religion is unusual among divisive labels in being
<br>
spectacularly unnecessary. If religious beliefs had any evidence
<br>
going for them, we might have to respect them in spite of their
<br>
concomitant unpleasantness. But there is no such evidence. To label
<br>
people as death-deserving enemies because of disagreements about real
<br>
world politics is bad enough. To do the same for disagreements about
<br>
a delusional world inhabited by archangels, demons and imaginary
<br>
friends is ludicrously tragic.   &quot;

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
