<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was nothing more than a rundown of a position based on opinions

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddism, etc. are faiths based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the &quot;blind&quot; belief of one reality over another.  Since they
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Is that a blind belief?  Scientific validation is not the only
<br>
way to come to what one considers valid and crucially important.
<br>
I don't think Extropians are required to only find value and/or
<br>
validation by science and not by anything else ever in any
<br>
aspect of their existence.  Nor do I think you yourself believe
<br>
that this is the case.  So I am a bit confused as to what you
<br>
are attempting to say here.
<br>
<p>Many spiritual systems do not require blind faith but consist of
<br>
a series of exercises and practices possibly leading to a
<br>
validation of a way of being in the world that is seen as of
<br>
great value.  Some of these sorts of practices exist within all
<br>
of the major religions and outside of them as well.  But I am
<br>
sure you are aware of this also.  So why speak as if religion is
<br>
just about &quot;blind belief&quot;?
