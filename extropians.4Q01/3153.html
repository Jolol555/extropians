<em>&gt; I cannot believe anyone on this list can think that Atkins (both) have not

<p>I am only one &quot;Atkins&quot;.  There is also Brian Atkins here and,
<br>
occassionally, his wife Sabine.  We are distinct and different
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>While I admit I have occassionaly got overwrought and succumbed
<br>
to the temptation to tell someone off, I have made a very real
<br>
effort to avoid such practice and to apologize when I lapse. 
<br>
<p>Again, if you think crying that I do the same thing excuses
<br>
others or makes the problem not a problem I think that your
<br>
reasoning is a bit flawed on this manner and secondly that you
<br>
are accusing me at a level that is not justified and that you
<br>
have not provided evidence for.  Saying you &quot;cannot believe..&quot;
<br>
that others don't see things as you do is not evidence and does
<br>
not improve your position.  
<br>
<p>And, really, what does it matter anyway?
