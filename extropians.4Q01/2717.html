Dyson bids to fill robot vacuum

<br>
JAMES Dyson has robots on his mind. Robots that will clean the house
<br>
intelligently while you are out, deciding what needs the most attention,
<br>
avoiding that wine glass on the floor.
<br>
<p>Two prototype 'artificial intelligence' vacuum cleaners sit in his offices at
<br>
Malmesbury, watching and (no doubt) thinking. 'Robots will be a large part of
<br>
the future, so developing navigation technology and artificial intelligence is
<br>
important for us,' he said. He knows that others are racing to compete.
<br>
<p>This hi-tech complex in the peaceful Wiltshire countryside is where Dyson has
<br>
realised his dream. He has 1,700 staff there and more than 2,000 around the
<br>
world, making the Dyson vacuum cleaners that he spent 20 years devising.
<br>
<p>Hero
<br>
This is not just an oddball inventor. James Dyson is a hero. If there were 10
<br>
of him, British industry would be transformed. If you doubt it, read Against
<br>
the Odds - his own account of his epic struggle to design and build his
<br>
world-beating cleaner. Four million machines have been sold.
<br>
<p>Brought up in Norfolk in a 'Swallows and Amazons childhood' of sand dunes and
<br>
dinghy sailing, he scraped through his O Levels. But the death of his father,
<br>
a classics master, when he was nine gave him a deep determination to succeed.
<br>
Four years of studying design at the Royal College of Art led him, at 23, to
<br>
join engineer Rotork in Bath, working with the inventor Jeremy Fry.
<br>
<p>At 27 he designed the Ballbarrow, replacing the wheelbarrow's wheel with a
<br>
versatile ball. This was a success, but one which turned sour. In a board row,
<br>
Dyson was ousted, having naively surrendered the patent rights. 'Not a mistake
<br>
I was ever to make again,' he said.
<br>
<p>In 1978, he moved to a house in the Cotswolds. While vacuuming, he noticed the
<br>
cleaner soon lost its suction. Typically, he cut it open and began
<br>
experimenting. He found that the machine lost power once its bag clogged with
<br>
dust. Wondering how it might work without a bag, he hit on the notion of a
<br>
'cyclone' for suction, and built a home-made cleaner out of cardboard and
<br>
tape.
<br>
<p>That was the easy bit. Five years and 5,127 prototypes later, his idea had
<br>
been turned down by a series of top companies. Cleaning companies who made
<br>
£100m a year selling bags were not interested. Weary, despondent and deep in
<br>
debt, Dyson decided to make the machines himself. The rest is history. Japan
<br>
was his first conquest. Design prizes and royalties began to trickle in. In
<br>
1993 he set up his first factory. By 1995 the Dyson Dual Cyclone was the UK's
<br>
best-selling cleaner.
<br>
<p>It was payoff time. Annual sales soared from £2.4m to £9m, then £35m, £72m,
<br>
£97m and £149m. Last year they hit £223m and Dyson had half the UK market.
<br>
Pre-tax profits were £30m in 1998, £27m in 1999. Dyson collected a string of
<br>
honourary doctorates. Rich lists valued him at £500m.
<br>
<p>Research
<br>
Dyson, who keeps fit by running, took it all in his stride. He says he owns
<br>
the whole company 'by default'. 'I tried to get investors but failed.' Dyson
<br>
puts back £30m a year into research. Planning problems quashed his hopes of
<br>
expanding at Malmesbury and adding 1,000 jobs. Facing a four-year delay, he
<br>
said: 'We have given up the idea.
<br>
<p>'We are producing some machines in Malaysia, and working 24 hours here. One
<br>
day we will have to expand elsewhere.'
<br>
<p>His board includes former BA boss Bob Ayling and ex-Asda chief Allan Leighton.
<br>
<p>Will the group stay private? 'It suits us this way at the moment. As to the
<br>
future, I don't know.' He is now 54, but says: 'I haven't thought about
<br>
retirement. Designing new products is the fun, not the business itself. I am a
<br>
washing machine and vacuum enthusiast. That's what I love and enjoy.'
<br>
<p>New products are his babies, and he is a proud father. Last on the market was
<br>
the contrarotator washing machine. The robots come next. Not just any old
<br>
robots. 'Random and radio-controlled robots are simple,' he said. 'What's not
<br>
simple is a robot that behaves intelligently, like a human being. That's what
<br>
we are trying to do.' He needs to keep moving. Electrolux brought a robotic
<br>
cleaner to market this month, and a German firm has one coming.
<br>
<p>What else have Dyson's 300 researchers got up their sleeves? 'There are other
<br>
applications for robotics,' Dyson said. 'It might be used for clearing
<br>
landmines, for example. Once you have that kind of mapping, there are other
<br>
possibilities.'
<br>
<p>Change
<br>
Casting his attention to 50 years into the future, he said: 'I think quite a
<br>
lot of the things that annoy us today will not be around. The chore of reading
<br>
instruction manuals, the difficulty of understanding technology, will be
<br>
things of the past. Take video programming. It's ridiculous to put in so much
<br>
data just to record a TV programme. Then there is the charade of burglar
<br>
alarms. Life will become simpler.
<br>
<p>'Our homes will change. Dividing them into little rooms does not suit how we
<br>
live today. The Victorians got it wrong. I think we will revert to the
<br>
medieval hall - everything in one big space. It's happening already with
<br>
loft-style apartments. Our lives are so busy now, the home must be like
<br>
Clapham Junction.'
<br>
<p>Having battled so tenaciously to build his empire, Dyson is still fighting. He
<br>
has just won a lengthy 'copycat' court case against Hoover. 'I don't think I
<br>
have more fights than anyone else,' he said. 'But part of the problem with
<br>
intellectual property is that people do pinch it. I call it theft. Songwriters
<br>
have automatic copyright. They don't copy Paul McCartney. In my field, you pay
<br>
through the nose for patents.'
<br>
<p>He has even quarrelled with the Consumers' Association. In calmer mode, he
<br>
said: 'I would be mad not to feel under threat. I don't mind that, it provides
<br>
the adrenaline. We've got to keep developing.'
<br>
<p>Long term
<br>
Why can't more UK manufacturers follow his example? 'There is a cultural
<br>
problem. Manufacturing requires long-term investment. It took 13 years to
<br>
develop the cleaner, six for the washing machine. Stock markets and bankers
<br>
think short term, so does the Government in taxation. All this creates a
<br>
hostile environment.'
<br>
<p>Outside work, Dyson plays tennis and drives a JCB around his garden. His wife
<br>
Deirdre is a painter with a rug shop in Chelsea, near daughter Emily's bed
<br>
linen shop. Son Jacob is a designer, younger son Sam a rock musician.
<br>
<p>His favourite invention? 'Charles Goodyear's vulcanised rubber. Almost every
<br>
product nowadays has it, even the Space Shuttle. He invented it all and died a
<br>
pauper'.
<br>
<p>Fortunately, Dyson is different.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;You'll learn to like robots.
<br>
They'll be nicer than human beings.&quot;
