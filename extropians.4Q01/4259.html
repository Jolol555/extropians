&nbsp;&nbsp;New Mars orbiter gets whiff of possible water
<br>
<p><p><p>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -- NASA's Odyssey spacecraft, tightening its 
<br>
orbit around Mars for a mapping mission, has sniffed out big hydrogen 
<br>
deposits, possibly indicating extensive water ice, according to 
<br>
project scientists.
<br>
<p>Odyssey, which left Earth earlier in the year and slipped into its 
<br>
initial orbit around Mars in October, is operating as planned and has 
<br>
started to send back its first bursts of scientific data.
<br>
<p>&quot;We think it will be a very exciting winter and spring,&quot; James 
<br>
Garvin, Mars Program scientist at NASA headquarters in Washington, 
<br>
said Wednesday at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San 
<br>
Francisco.
<br>
<p>Scientists have high hopes for the $300 million Odyssey project, 
<br>
which follows two failed missions to the red planet that had cast 
<br>
doubt on the space agency's plans to investigate Earth's nearest 
<br>
planetary neighbor.
<br>
<p>A box-shaped craft designed to spend 2-1/2 years circling Mars to 
<br>
study its climate and geological history, Odyssey was launched in 
<br>
April and made the interplanetary trip without a hitch.
<br>
<p>NASA scientists said the spacecraft was now about two-thirds of the 
<br>
way through a complex braking process designed to ease it into final 
<br>
mapping orbit about 250 miles (400 km) above the surface by 
<br>
mid-January.
<br>
<p>Previous setbacks
<br>
<p>Odyssey's smooth progress contrasts with its predecessors' problems. 
<br>
In December 1999, the Mars Polar Lander smashed into Mars' surface 
<br>
after a false signal caused its engines to shut off too soon. And a 
<br>
few months earlier, the Mars Climate Orbiter burned up in the 
<br>
planet's atmosphere because of a mix-up between English and metric 
<br>
measurements.
<br>
<p>But officials have vowed that the Mars program will continue, 
<br>
envisioning a multiyear series of missions that will ultimately 
<br>
include landing more rovers on the Martian surface, as well as 
<br>
setting up the Mars Smart Lander as an on-site laboratory.
<br>
<p>Odyssey is expected to begin its primary mission in January, when it 
<br>
will use various scientific instruments to study the chemical and 
<br>
mineral composition of the planet.
<br>
<p>Red planet could be riddled with underground ice deposits.
<br>
<p>A gamma-ray spectrometer will chart the chemical makeup of the 
<br>
Martian surface, searching for rocks and soil indicative of water in 
<br>
the distant past. A neutron spectrometer will look for signs of 
<br>
hydrogen in the soil, a telltale sign of water or ice below the 
<br>
surface. And an infrared camera will peer at areas on the dark side 
<br>
of Mars where water or some other liquid may be breaking the surface 
<br>
today.
<br>
<p>On Wednesday, scientists said the first pass by the neutron 
<br>
spectrometer had revealed evidence of hydrogen in the soil in 
<br>
northern regions near the pole.
<br>
<p>Big swing of the needle
<br>
<p>&quot;It is big,&quot; Bill Feldman of Los Alamos National Laboratory said, 
<br>
referring to the magnitude of the instrument's first, preliminary 
<br>
reading.
<br>
<p>Feldman, who is in charge of the neutron spectrometer aspect of the 
<br>
mission, said the results indicated large amounts of hydrogen on the 
<br>
surface, a likely sign of water ice.
<br>
<p>They &quot;are precisely what you would expect for a very hydrogen-rich 
<br>
environment,&quot; Feldman said.
<br>
<p>Scientists know that water exists on Mars but so far have believed it 
<br>
is mostly frozen in the polar icecaps or drifting about the 
<br>
atmosphere in thin clouds.
<br>
<p>Scientists who have studied images of the Martian surface believe 
<br>
they have seen evidence that water once flowed there, carving out 
<br>
deep channels and canyons.
<br>
<p>Significant water ice deposits easily accessible on the surface of 
<br>
the planet would benefit any future Mars mission astronauts and make 
<br>
it much more likely that life might have existed on the planet.
<br>
<p>NASA scientists said they were excited by the initial indications of 
<br>
hydrogen deposits, describing the readings sent back as clearer, more 
<br>
definite and much earlier than had been expected.
<br>
<p>&quot;We were expecting that it would take many orbits (to determine the 
<br>
presence of hydrogen),&quot; said Stephen Saunders, a scientist on the 
<br>
Odyssey project. &quot;But we saw it the very first time.&quot;
