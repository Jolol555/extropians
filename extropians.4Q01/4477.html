<p>Ok, what we did:  sent aid workers.
<br>
<p>What they did:  throw them into prison and threaten to execute them.
<br>
<p>What we did:  drop food packages to try to prevent innocents from starving.
<br>
<p>What they did:  gather them and keep them away from those who needed them
<br>
most.
<br>
<p>What we did:  demonstrate the benefits of freedom.
<br>
<p>What they did:  destroy freedom.
<br>
<p>What we did:  Failed to deal effectively with their previous terrorism.
<br>
<p>What they did:  Used our planes to slay thousands of innocents.
<br>
<p>Actions speak louder than words, and the actions of the Taliban
<br>
and al-qaida speak loudly indeed.  The Taliban seemed content to
<br>
allow the masses to starve, so long as they didnt listen to music.  They
<br>
were content to allow their women to perish for want of medical
<br>
attention, so long as they kept their faces covered.  They destroyed
<br>
Afghanistan, in order to demonstrate the perfect Islamic government.
<br>
<p>OK, they demonstrated it.  And now, if anything good comes of
<br>
this war, its that millions of middle easterners will decide they want
<br>
no part of this, and will choose instead freedom of conscience, will
<br>
choose technology instead of luddism, will choose economic
<br>
models that work.  They said if allah is with them, they would
<br>
succeed.  They didn't, so perhaps the terrorist sleeper cells in the
<br>
west will never wake up.  That's my hope.
<br>
<p>Honestly, these leaders of the Taliban and Al-qaida are the
<br>
most deplorable excuses for human beings that this planet
<br>
has ever produced.  There is no need to apologize for them,
<br>
Samantha, they are beyond all redemption.  The Taliban have
<br>
been compared to the Nazis.  I see them as more analogous
<br>
to Charles Manson and his followers.  To blame the the US
<br>
for the attacks is analogous to blaming Manson family victim
<br>
Sharon Tate for being blonde.  spike
