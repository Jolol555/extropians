The Lie Detector That Scans Your Brain
<br>
The idea of monitoring brain waves isn't new. Scientists have long known that
<br>
certain recognizable waves occur when people are surprised, pleased or
<br>
frightened. But recently the technique has become much more precise. At Brain
<br>
Fingerprinting Laboratories, a company in Fairfield, Iowa, the chief
<br>
scientist, Lawrence Farwell, interrogates suspects by checking their EEG's for
<br>
''P300 waves.'' These waves are produced when the brain encounters words or
<br>
images that it recognizes; thus the police, Farwell claims, can present a
<br>
suspect with information that only a criminal would know and see if the brain
<br>
recognizes it.
<br>
<p>Farwell's technique recently shot to prominence when he scanned Terry
<br>
Harrington, a convicted murderer trying to win a new trial. Harrington's brain
<br>
did not betray recognition images from the crime scene but did react to scenes
<br>
from his alibi - which suggested he was actually innocent. Still, the
<br>
technique remains controversial, and many have argued it could be as faulty as
<br>
the polygraph (though the judge in the Harrington case accepted the brain scan
<br>
as evidence, he turned down the appeal for a new trial). Farwell's strategy
<br>
also raises longstanding cognitive questions about the fickle nature of
<br>
memory. Just because someone doesn't remember crime-scene details doesn't mean
<br>
he or she is innocent.
