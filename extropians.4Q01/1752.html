From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Secrets%20of%20The%20Mind%20[ie,%20brain]&In-Reply-To=&lt;01f301c15e2b$51333680$645d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I know, I have listened to Ramachandran's lectures and they are very fun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (last time he got into a debate with last year's nobel laureate Eric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kandel about art theory). I have not yet read his books, but if they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half as fun as his lectures they are really worth checking out.
</em><br>
<p>Dunno about his books either, but his Nova show was more than fun. His theory
<br>
about neural wiring and pathways is verified by experiment. The implication is
<br>
that our brains are not &quot;hard-wired&quot; from birth, but rather grow connections
<br>
that map reality (and our bodies) onto the cerebral cortex. So, the brain is
<br>
not a computer registering sensory input, but rather an emulation-in-progress
<br>
as the sensory inputs actually define and direct the architecture of the
<br>
brain.
<br>
Especially interesting is his idea of awareness as a concentration of
<br>
deliberate attention rather than an epiphenomenon of cognitive interaction
<br>
with the environment. The best part of all was when he described the neural
<br>
pathways between vision and emotional salience, in the segment about David,
<br>
the man with a condition called Capgras Delusion. He knew who and where he
<br>
was, but he was sure that the people who said they were his parents were
<br>
imposters. Dr. Ramachandran says David's injury destroyed pathways for
<br>
emotional information, and since he didn't feel the appropriate emotions
<br>
toward his parents, he concluded that they were lying look-alikes. (Reminder
<br>
to uploaders: Don't forget to include the enteric nervous system.)
<br>
Another file concerned John, who has temporal lobe epilepsy, and his seizures
<br>
leave him with the absolute conviction that he is God. The doctor suggests
<br>
that the seizures may have disrupted a part of the brain &quot;whose activity is
<br>
somehow conducive to religious belief,&quot; and that such a receptive region may
<br>
have evolved because &quot;it's conducive to stability of society.&quot;
<br>
The doctor failed, however, to mention that it may also be conducive to the
<br>
emergence of suicide bombers, but then, the show was created way before Sept.
<br>
11.
<br>
Conclusion: The cognitive significance of sensations makes experience the most
<br>
valuable part of human knowledge.
