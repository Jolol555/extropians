<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why is protection of publishing industries more important to American

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; politicians than ammendments I, IV, V, and X?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; How does the 1st Amendment apply? Your right of free expression does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; mean you have the right to express other people's expressions without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; their consent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It also prohibits derivative works: I cannot produce a translation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adaptation, or a work in another medium based on a copyrighted work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (such as, say, a book comparing short stories by different authors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or a rap song sampling differing tunes).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is inaccurate. Sampling and referenced quotation are entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted 'fair use' exceptions. The problem is when you use so much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone elses work in your work that you are essentially creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing new.
</em><br>
<p>Sampling is NOT &quot;fair use&quot;--just look at the long lists of permissions
<br>
on rap albums.  Yes, some excerpting is &quot;fair use&quot;, but such use us
<br>
very limited--only small excerpts, either for non-commercial use, or
<br>
parody (even though even Weird Al has been sued many times) or a few
<br>
other uses.  By why _shouldn't_ it include reproducing, say, three
<br>
short stories in their entirety interspersed with commentary and
<br>
comparison?  Is that not a useful document?  Why shouldn't it
<br>
include a translation into the language of a small market the author
<br>
or his publisher doesn't want to pursue, but that it important to
<br>
the translator who does the work?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  I can't use a song as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; soundtrack to a movie, or make a remix, or many other creative things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because if you use so much of another's work, your use is not original,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and therefore is not art, it is reproduction.
</em><br>
<p>This is such a profound misunderstanding of the nature of &quot;art&quot; that
<br>
it is laughable.  ALL art is derivative.  Even the king of copyright
<br>
abuse, Walt Disney, would be crippled without stories and characters
<br>
from the public domain, yet his heirs refuse to allow his work to
<br>
give back to that public domain--they insist on &quot;owning&quot; important
<br>
parts of American culture like Mickey Mouse, long beyond the time
<br>
when their ownership would have created incentives for production.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And this is true even if the artist is long dead and cannot possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefit from copyright protection, because most copyrights are owned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by publishing companies.  Just ask anyone who has tried to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; undergound cartoons with Disnet characters.  Copyright stifles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expression as much, if not more, than it encourages it.  Likewise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; patents prevent me from making a minor improvement to an existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; invention, or combining inventions in useful ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not oppose the elimination of corporate ownership of IP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corporations are not senient beings, and therefore cannot be artists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Constitution clearly states that Congress is to protect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creators, the artists, not anyone else. However, as an artist, I highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppose the idea that you can take someone else's work and tweak it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little to be able to claim it as your own.
</em><br>
<p>Well that's a start.  But please don't confuse infringement with
<br>
plagiarism--that's an entirely separate subject and one which I happen
<br>
to agree with you on--claiming someone else's work as your own is
<br>
fraud, and will--and should--remain illegal even if copyright is
<br>
abolished.  So please stick to the subject.  I don't want the right
<br>
to publish a Mike Lorrey book and claim that I wrote it.  I want to
<br>
be able to publish a Mike Lorrey book on some medium that you don't,
<br>
fully crediting you.  Or to translate it, or excerpt from it freely,
<br>
stil giving you full credit.  Yes, that will cut into your market,
<br>
so my proposal will require you to rethink how to make money from
<br>
your book in a world where you can't interfere with my reproduction
<br>
of it.  That will require some creative business modeling, which
<br>
has been discussed before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The 4th? Considering an artist who never makes any money because his art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is stolen by millions of ungrateful fans starves to death, I propose...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That one's been batted out of the park so many times I won't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bother with it, except to say that I'm surprized how many otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; libertarians, who would otherwise never assume that a law actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accomplishes what the politicians who passed it says it will, are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; willing to assume that copyrights and patents actually accomplish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what they claim, or even that the real reasons for their passage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are the same as the claimed reasons.  And what do you say, Mr. Lorrey,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the former admins of anon.penet.fi, who used to run a popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anonymization service that was shut down by the feds at the request
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the Church of Scientology over copyright issues?  Was that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonable seizure of criminal taking money from the pockets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; artists?  What do you say to Dmitri Sklyarov, now in jail under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; DMCA for publishing security information about a piece of software?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Was that seizure reasonable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientology is obviously trying to have their cake and eat it. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim their work is 'art' to protect its proprietary value in skinning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marks, yet also claim it is historical truth and religious dogma to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect themselves against taxation and fraud charges. Using them as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example has likewise been batted out of the park so many times that I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather surprised you are using it here, Lee.
</em><br>
<p>It's a good example of the kind of abuses that become possible when the
<br>
law is as powerful as it is.  Yes, it's an extreme example, but I don't
<br>
think it's particularly unique.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The DMCA is obviously a flawed law that needs legal precedents to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate its problems. I personally wouldn't mind eliminating the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of corporations to own IP.
</em><br>
<p>I applaud your minor concession, but if you cling to the idea that it
<br>
is indeed a form of &quot;property&quot;, how can you prevent it being bought and
<br>
sold?  Either it's property or it isn't.  If it isn't, then you don't
<br>
support I{, but you support something more like the original definition
<br>
in the constitution: an explicit government-granted exclusive right to
<br>
take certain actions, enforced by a private right of action to sue
<br>
those who infringe.  That would certainly be a step in the right
<br>
direction, but I'm still not convinved it wouldn't be better to just
<br>
junk the whole idea.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; ...and the unenumerated rights of the people.  Such as the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human right to use the information in your head to improve your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life, without having to know where every little piece of it came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from or which uses are legal and which aren't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Usage is fine. If you posess the information, you should know where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got if from, and it is rather easy to understand what uses are legal and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are not. Only con artists would try to claim otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Absolute poppycock.  I don't know where half the stuff in my head came
<br>
from, and neither do you.  That's not how human brains work.  We don't
<br>
have little tags on ideas for their source.  Human culture is a mass
<br>
of ideas--tunes, words, math, machines, processes--whose origins are
<br>
lost in antiquity, yet which were undoubtedly the creative work of
<br>
someone.  Our culture grows when that public domain of ideas grows.
<br>
Do I know who to pay royalties to for the idea of the 12-tone scale
<br>
all modern Western music uses, or every chord progression. or grouping
<br>
of instruments, or the notation system?  Those are every bit as much
<br>
creative inventions as the particular tune I might create--which will
<br>
no doubt be influenced by the culture of all the music I listened to
<br>
growing up, all I heard on the radio last week, and all the other
<br>
influences I can't possibly enumerate, much less recall with full
<br>
credits.  The epitome of this silliness is when John Fogerty was
<br>
taken to court for copying himself--he probably had no idea at the
<br>
time he wrote &quot;Old Man Down the Road&quot; that it was essentially the
<br>
same tune as &quot;Run Through the Jungle&quot;, he just thought it sounded
<br>
good as it came out.  Maybe he did; I don't know.  But at any rate
<br>
I think it's silly to require artists to precisely remember and
<br>
credit all their influences.  It's just not possible.  Artists don't
<br>
&quot;create&quot; ex nihilo, they synthesize influences of culture, upbringing,
<br>
and personal values in interesting ways; their results influence
<br>
others.  We shouldn't get in the way of that process.
<br>
<p>Eliminating copyright ownership by corporations might have eliminted
<br>
that particular suit, and perhaps NBC's suing David Letterman over
<br>
the idea of top ten lists.  I'll have to think a bit about what other
<br>
side effects that might have, and if it might be a reasonable step
<br>
in the right direction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; One could say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; intellectual property rights, because they exist within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; constitution, are the 0th Amendment rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That section of the constitution enumerates the rights of congress,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one of which is the right to make laws estabishing intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property rights.  It does not require them to do so, it only allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them to (and they have chosesn to pass such laws).  The Bil of Rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enumerates those things that congress _cannot_ legislate away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the people, because they are basic human rights.  When sections of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the constitution conflict, the courts and congress are expected to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compromise.  It is not at all unreasonable to suggest that present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; copyright law should be re-evaluated in the light of its effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on free speech and other rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, not quite. The Bill of Rights is not the only part which defines the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights of individuals. The right to vote, for example, is defined within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the body of the Constitution. The preamble also defines a right of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to reconstruct the government, to replace one that has grown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tyrannical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, copyright is now recognised as a constitutional right of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual. You don't need to register a copyright in order to hold one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on your works. Getting your work notarized by any other means (Justice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Peace, court clerk, postmark, etc) also acts as an informal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; registration, since in IP disputes, the date of creation is of key
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance (as is degree of exposure).
</em><br>
<p>You don't even need informal registration: just the fact of publication
<br>
creates copyright, unless it is explicitly disclaimed (which is why I
<br>
have to explicity disclaim copyright for everything I write, as I do
<br>
in my signature and on my website).  But that fact doesn't come from the
<br>
Constitution, it comes from the Berne convention treaty that the US signed
<br>
in 1980.  Yes, that's a 19; modern copyright is a very recent thing.
