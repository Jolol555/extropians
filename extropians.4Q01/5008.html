<p>I think probably everyone would agree that we want a colorblind
<br>
world.  But wanting that doesn't get us there, by itself.
<br>
<p>A few days ago, Damien made a comment about the hippies'
<br>
desire to decree away jealousy, free love for all, etc.  But that
<br>
did not make it go away.  Today no one even pretends we know
<br>
how, as a society, to do away with jealously.
<br>
<p>We find in ourselves many examples of socialization that are
<br>
no longer useful, yet many of us find it difficult or impossible
<br>
to simply turn them off.  We seem to have been hard wired.
<br>
<p>We want a world of peace.  Wanting it doesn't get us there.
<br>
&quot;Last night I had the strangest dream Id ever dreamed before,
<br>
I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war.
<br>
I dreamed I saw a mighty room, the room was filled with men,
<br>
the paper they were signing said they'd never fight again.&quot;
<br>
But we did fight again.  Good chance we will fight again.
<br>
<p>We want a world free of racism.  But how do we get to the
<br>
perspective of species-wide unity?  Just by thinking about
<br>
transhumanity, uploading  AI and the singularity?  Is that really
<br>
all we need?  Are there any wetware changes, physical
<br>
modifications we need to do?  Are we not hardwired to
<br>
compete?  To fight?  To favor those who are more genetically
<br>
similar to ourselves?  To be jealous of others' amorous attention
<br>
to our mates?  Can we really decree all this away, just be wanting to?
<br>
<p>I hope so.  But I may be a bit less optimistic that you are,
<br>
Eliezer.  Thought provoking post, tho, thanks!  {8-]  spike
