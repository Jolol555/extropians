G.P.:
<br>
'Yours &lt;N. Bostrom&gt; is the best demonstration of the existence of a
<br>
&quot;Christian God&quot;, a potentially capricious being who runs the universe
<br>
from the outside and may be interested in the beings within his universe.
<br>
Another way to state the conclusions is that, given the assumptions,
<br>
the probability that I live in a universe created and run by a god
<br>
is very high.'

<p>R. A. Lafferty ('Annals of Klepsis', chapter 8) wrote that people
<br>
are too much superficial, fuzzy, blurred. Thus, according to Lafferty,
<br>
it's difficult to believe that God - in person - has something to do
<br>
with those 'unreal' people. He suggests that some 'demiurge' might
<br>
have done the job. 
<br>
<p>But this easily leads to the 'tower of turtles' argument.
<br>
<p>In example Basilides taught that Nous was the first to be born from
<br>
the Unborn Father; from Nous was born Logos; from Logos Phronesis;
<br>
from Phronesis Sophia and Dynamis, and from Phronesis and Dynamis
<br>
the Virtues, the Principalities, and the Archangels. By these the
<br>
highest heaven was made, by their descendants the second heaven,
<br>
and by the descendants again of these the third, and so on till
<br>
they reached the number 365. Hence the year has as many days as
<br>
there are heavens. The angels, who hold the last or visible heaven,
<br>
brought about all things that are in the world and shared amongst
<br>
themselves the earth and the nations upon it.
<br>
<p>But the Zohar mentions 390 heavens and over 70,000 worlds.
<br>
And Jellenek (in Beth Ha-Midrasch) recalls a legend which tells
<br>
of 955 heavens ...

<p>(Calvino's imaginative argument)
<br>
<p>- Italo Calvino - 
<br>
<p>'Invisible Cities' (1972)
<br>
<p>VI, Cities and the sky.
<br>
<p>In Eudossia, that extends up and low, with meandering alleys, steps, narrow
<br>
lanes, hovels, a carpet is kept in which you can contemplate the real shape
<br>
of the city. At first nothing seems to resemble less Eudossia than the
<br>
design of the carpet, ordered in symmetrical figures that repeat their
<br>
patterns along straight and circular lines, woven of needleful of dazzling
<br>
colors, which alternating wefts you can follow all along the warp. But if
<br>
you stop to observe it with attention, you perceive that to every place of
<br>
the carpet corresponds a place of the city and that all the things contained
<br>
in the city are comprised in the design, arranged according to their true
<br>
relationships, which escape to your eye distracted from the coming and going
<br>
from the swarming from the awful crush. All the confusion in Eudossia, the
<br>
bray of the mules, the spots of lamp-black, the smell of fish, is what
<br>
appear in the partial perspective that you pick; but the carpet proves that
<br>
there is a point from which the city shows its true proportions, the
<br>
geometric outline implicit in its every minimal detail.
<br>
<p>Getting lost in Eudossia is easy: but when you concentrates staring the
<br>
carpet you recognize the road that you were looking for in a crimson or
<br>
indigo or amaranth thread that through a long round lets you enter in a
<br>
purple fence that is your true point of arrival. Every inhabitant of
<br>
Eudossia confronts to the immovable order of the carpet his own image of the
<br>
city, an anguish, and everyone can find hidden between the arabesques an
<br>
answer, the story of his life, the twists of his destiny.
<br>
<p>An oracle was consultated about the mysterious relationship between two such
<br>
different objects as the carpet and the city. One of the two objects, - it
<br>
was the response, - has the shape that the gods gave to the starry sky and
<br>
to the orbits around which the worlds spin; the other one is an approximate
<br>
glare, like every human work.
<br>
<p>The augurs since so long were sure that the harmonic design of the carpet
<br>
was of divine nature; in this sense the oracle was interpreted, without
<br>
giving place to controversies. But in the same way you can draw the opposite
<br>
conclusion: that the real map of the universe is the city of Eudossia as it
<br>
is, a spot that spreads without shape, with zigzag roads, houses collapsing
<br>
above one another in the dust, fires, cries in the dark.
