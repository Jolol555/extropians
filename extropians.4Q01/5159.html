</em><br>
<p>Samantha, you are no kind of expert when it comes to warfare. Missiles
<br>
and air-power alone are completely useless against a numerically
<br>
superior land force in the end-game of any conflict involving large
<br>
quantities of infantry and little artillery or armor. While submunitions
<br>
are effective in dealing with dealing with units in a fixed area, we
<br>
have no way whatsoever to deal with several million troops crossing the
<br>
border at once, especially if there are no landmines in the DMZ.
<br>
<p>Part of the reason the North is dirt poor is because it continues to
<br>
leach about 75% of the GDP to equip and train its army, which is one of
<br>
the five largest on earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Because we are obsessed with the notion of other nations secretly researching and building such weapons without our knowledge.  This would give them the option of blackmailing the United States.  I think obviously the U.S. does not want to miss the bo
</em><br>
at on the next technology to be a crucial equalizer.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are obsessed with any nation having the means to oppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever we wish to do in the world to be succinct.
</em><br>
<p>And why do you act like that is a bad thing? Name one nation in history
<br>
that has posessed the relative power we do and pursued a less
<br>
self-interested foreign policy than we have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If we had such a treaty for weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. and United Nations would be kept very busy with invading the rogue states who are in violation!  We would have a Gulf or Afghan war every year...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Afghan war had nothing to do with any such thing.  Neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did Desert Storm.  Those are only subsidiary excuses.
</em><br>
<p>Oh really? Just what criminally selfish economic motivations did we have
<br>
in destroying the Taliban and al Qaeda?
