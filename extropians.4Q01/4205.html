<p>In copying you are disconnecting a sentience from it's I/O
<br>
(sensors/actuators), keeping all its memories, copying it, and then
<br>
reconnecting the copy to it's own set of I/O, in a different physical
<br>
location. From that instant you have two sentiences on divergent life-paths.
<br>
Of course they are not the same. For in-depth analysis of this phenomenon
<br>
consult that prodigious journal of wisdom - Red Dwarf, where Rimmer and a
<br>
copy of himself gradually diverge from total sameness to completely
<br>
different to enemies. All in a half hour show.
<br>
<p>I asked the list a long time ago if anyone had ever 'graded' sentience. I
<br>
never got any reply but I grow more concerned that we may need a system of
<br>
licences to control the creation of sentience beyond a certain level. A true
<br>
sentience, that knows that it knows that it knows - replete with experiences
<br>
and values and relationships - should not be allowed to be
<br>
copied/killed/mutated willy nilly. The life of the sporadic holo-doctor on
<br>
Star Trek Voyager is still a life - can you imagine the series without
<br>
him/her/ve/whatever?
<br>
<p>There is a book - SciFi - Robin Cook...can't remember the name?? where
<br>
humans live multiple serial lives in different bodies. When they've burned
<br>
out a body they go into a machine. It makes a carbon mesh copy of the brain,
<br>
they gestate a new body, and grow the new brain with the pattern of the
<br>
original. Voila....immortality. Or is it? The only thing you can say for
<br>
sure is that the original human went into the machine quite by choice, happy
<br>
in the knowledge that something good was going to happen. A dead body came
<br>
out. The rights of the potential sentience in the new body were not
<br>
addressed in any serious fashion. Nor were the rights of the 'potential
<br>
continued sentience' of the old body.
<br>
<p>Whilst in the machine the sentience could still be 'related to' verbally,
<br>
although what they replace all the sensory and organ I/O with beats me. It'd
<br>
be a weird experience. Imagine all those hormone secretion synapses in the
<br>
pretend neuron mesh trying to 'squirt' non-existent hormones into ...what?
<br>
I digress.
<br>
<p>I think you get my drift.
