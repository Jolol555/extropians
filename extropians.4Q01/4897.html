<p>Hi. I think you are thinking of Provigil (modafinil) which is 
<br>
currently being used for the treatment of narcolepsy. For more 
<br>
information see:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic2/modafinil.htm">http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic2/modafinil.htm</a>
<br>
<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION AND PHARMACOLOGY
<br>
<p>The precise mechanism(s) through which modafinil promotes wakefulness is
<br>
unknown. Modafinil has wake-promoting actions like sympathomimetic
<br>
agents including amphetamine and methylphenidate, although the
<br>
pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of sympathomimetic
<br>
amines.
<br>
<p>At pharmacologically relevant concentrations, modafinil does not bind to
<br>
most potentially relevant receptors for sleep/wake regulation, including
<br>
those for norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, GABA, adenosine,
<br>
histamine-3, melatonin, or benzodiazepines. Modafinil also does not
<br>
inhibit the activities of MAO-B or phosphodiesterases II-V.
<br>
<p>Modafinil is not a direct- or indirect-acting dopamine receptor agonist
<br>
and is inactive in several in vivo preclinical models capable of
<br>
detecting enhanced dopaminergic activity. In vitro, modafinil binds to
<br>
the dopamine reuptake site and causes an increase in extracellular
<br>
dopamine, but no increase in dopamine release. In a preclinical model,
<br>
the wakefulness induced by amphetamine, but not modafinil, is
<br>
antagonized by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol.
<br>
<p>Modafinil does not appear to be a direct or indirect alpha-adrenergic
<br>
agonist. Although modafinil-induced wakefulness can be attenuated by the
<br>
a1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin, in assay systems known to
<br>
be responsive to a1-adrenergic agonists, modafinil has no activity.
<br>
Modafinil does not display sympathomimetic activity in the rat vas
<br>
deferens preparations (agonist-stimulated or electrically stimulated)
<br>
nor does it increase the formation of the adrenergic receptor-mediated
<br>
second messenger phosphatidyl inositol in in vitro models. Unlike
<br>
sympathomimetic agents, modafinil does not reduce cataplexy in
<br>
narcoleptic canines and has minimal effects on cardiovascular and
<br>
hemodynamic parameters.
<br>
<p>In the cat, equal wakefulness-promoting doses of methylphenidate and
<br>
amphetamine increased neuronal activation throughout the brain.
<br>
Modafinil at an equivalent wakefulness-promoting dose selectively and
<br>
prominently increased neuronal activation in more discrete regions of
<br>
the brain.The relationship of this finding in cats to the effects of
<br>
modafinil in humans is unknown.
<br>
<p>In addition to its wakefulness-promoting effects and increased locomotor
<br>
activity in animals, in humans, PROVIGIL produces psychoactive and
<br>
euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, and thinking, and
<br>
feelings typical of other CNS stimulants. Modafinil is reinforcing, as
<br>
evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to
<br>
self administer cocaine; modafinil was also partially discriminated as
<br>
stimulant-like.
<br>
<p>The optical enantiomers of modafinil have similar pharmacological
<br>
actions in animals. The enantiomers have not been individually studied
<br>
in humans. Two major metabolites of modafinil, modafinil acid and
<br>
modafinil sulfone, do not appear to contribute to the CNS-activating
<br>
properties of modafinil.
<br>
<p><p>PHARMACOKINETICS
<br>
<p>Modafinil is a racemic compound, whose enantiomers have different
<br>
pharmacokinetics (e.g., the half-life of the l-isomer is approximately
<br>
three times that of the d-isomer in humans). The enantiomers do not
<br>
interconvert. At steady state, total exposure to the l-isomer is
<br>
approximately three times that for the d-isomer. The trough
<br>
concentration (Cminss) of circulating modafinil after once daily dosing
<br>
consists of 90% of the l-isomer and minss 10% of the d-isomer. The
<br>
effective elimination half-life of modafinil after multiple doses is
<br>
about 15 hours. The enantiomers of modafinil exhibit linear kinetics
<br>
upon multiple dosing of 200-600 mg/day once daily in healthy volunteers.
<br>
Apparent steady states of total modafinil and l-(-)-modafinil are
<br>
reached after 2-4 days of dosing.
<br>
<p><p>ABSORPTION AND DISTRIBUTION
<br>
<p>Absorption of PROVIGIL tablets is rapid, with peak plasma concentrations
<br>
occurring at 2-4 hours. The bioavailability of PROVIGIL tablets is
<br>
approximately equal to that of an aqueous suspension. The absolute oral
<br>
bioavailability was not determined due to the aqueous insolubility (&lt;1
<br>
mg/ml) of modafinil, which precluded intravenous administration. Food
<br>
has no effect on overall PROVIGIL bioavailability; however, its
<br>
absorption (tmax) may be delayed by approximately one hour if taken with
<br>
food.
<br>
<p>Modafinil is well distributed in body tissue with an apparent volume of
<br>
distribution (~0.9 L/kg) larger than the volume of total body water (0.6
<br>
L/kg). In human plasma, in vitro, modafinil is moderately bound to
<br>
plasma protein (~60%, mainly to albumin). At serum concentrations
<br>
obtained at steady state after doses of 200 mg/day, modafinil exhibits
<br>
no displacement of protein binding of warfarin, diazepam, or
<br>
propranolol. Even at much larger concentrations (1000µM; &gt;25 times the C
<br>
of 40µM at steady state at 400 mg/day), max modafinil has no effect on
<br>
warfarin binding. Modafinil acid at concentrations &gt;500µM decreases the
<br>
extent of warfarin binding, but these concentrations are &gt; 35 times
<br>
those achieved therapeutically.
<br>
<p><p>METABOLISM AND ELIMINATION
<br>
<p>The major route of elimination (~90%) is metabolism, primarily by the
<br>
liver, with subsequent renal elimination of the metabolites. Urine
<br>
alkalinization has no effect on the elimination of modafinil.
<br>
<p>Metabolism occurs through hydrolytic deamidation, S-oxidation, aromatic
<br>
ring hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. Less than 10% of an
<br>
administered dose is excreted as the parent compound. In a clinical
<br>
study using radiolabeled modafinil, a total of 81% of the administered
<br>
radioactivity was recovered in 11 days post-dose, predominantly in the
<br>
urine (80% vs. 1.0% in the feces). The largest fraction of the drug in
<br>
urine was modafinil acid, but at least six other metabolites were
<br>
present in lower concentrations. Only two metabolites reach appreciable
<br>
concentrations in plasma, i.e., modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone. In
<br>
preclinical models, modafinil acid, modafinil sulfone,
<br>
2-[(diphenylmethyl)sulfonyl]acetic acid and 4-hydroxy modafinil, were
<br>
inactive or did not appear to mediate the arousal effects of modafinil.
<br>
<p>In humans, modafinil shows a possible induction effect on its own
<br>
metabolism after chronic administration of doses ½400 mg/day. Induction
<br>
of hepatic metabolizing enzymes, most importantly cytochrome P450 (CYP)
<br>
3A4, has also been observed in vitro after incubation of primary
<br>
cultures of human hepatocytes with modafinil. (For further discussion of
<br>
the effects of modafinil on CYP enzyme activities see PRECAUTIONS, Drug
<br>
Interactions).
<br>
<p>DRUG-DRUG INTERACTIONS
<br>
<p>Because modafinil is a reversible inhibitor of the drug-metabolizing
<br>
enzyme CYP2C19, co-administration of modafinil with drugs such as
<br>
diazepam, phenytoin, and propranolol, which are largely eliminated via
<br>
that pathway, may increase the circulating levels of those compounds. In
<br>
addition, in individuals deficient in the enzyme CYP2D6 (i.e., 7-10% of
<br>
the Caucasian population; similar or lower in other populations), the
<br>
levels of CYP2D6 substrates such as tricyclic antidepressants and
<br>
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which have ancillary routes of
<br>
elimination through CYP2C19, may be increased by co-administration of
<br>
modafinil. Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients being treated
<br>
with these and similar medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).
<br>
<p>Chronic administration of modafinil may also cause modest induction of
<br>
the metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, thus reducing the levels of
<br>
co-administered substrates for that enzyme system, such as steroidal
<br>
contraceptives, cyclosporine and to a lesser degree, theophylline. Dose
<br>
adjustments may be necessary for patients being treated with these and
<br>
similar medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).
<br>
<p>An apparent concentration-related suppression of CYP2C9 activity was
<br>
observed in human hepatocytes after exposure to modafinil in vitro.
<br>
Although no other indication of CYP2C9 suppression has been observed,
<br>
the in vitro results suggest that there is potential for metabolic
<br>
interaction between PROVIGIL and CYP2C9 substrates, such as warfarin or
<br>
phenytoin (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).
