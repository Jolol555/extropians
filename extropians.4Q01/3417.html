</em><br>
<p>It is that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's

</em><br>
<p>I don't want to be overly optimistic, but, all things being equal, the
<br>
smaller a nation is -- economically, geographically, population-wise -- the
<br>
more it has to be rational in its policies.  For example, a nation the size
<br>
of Delaware could not erect huge trade barriers to protect industries at
<br>
home.  It would immediately impoverish it.  Also, if taxes were very high
<br>
there as compared with its neighbors, it would lose population -- either
<br>
through legal emigration or the illegal kind.  It would also lose foreign
<br>
investors and domestic money would try to flee as well.
<br>
<p>Thus, secessionism can lead to more libertarian polities.  There's no
<br>
guarantee here, but the likelihood is much higher.
<br>
<p>To some extent, this explains why big nations like the US can practice
<br>
protectionism.  Yes, protectionism is economically harmful, but the US has
<br>
large internal markets as well as many raw materials.  Protectionism does
<br>
hurt the US, but not as much as it would hurt, say, Delaware if it decided
<br>
to secede from the Union.  (The internal free trade inside the US acts like
<br>
a huge free trade zone too, so that helps to mitigate some of the problems
<br>
with external regulated trade.  Of course, the US is really not a free trade
<br>
zone in toto.  There are now ever more internal regulations on trade, but
<br>
for most of its history it was.)
<br>
<p>Keep going too.  If Wilmington seceded from Delaware and became its own
<br>
country, it would be even more insane for it to practice anti-free market
<br>
policies.  Likewise, if a neighborhood in Wilmington seceded.  Likewise, if
<br>
a household seceded from the neighborhood.
<br>
<p>Thus, secession in its logical extreme would force people to behave much
<br>
more rationally with regard to socio-economic policies.  They might not
<br>
always make the right choice, but the incentives and costs would be much
<br>
more alligned with libertarianism than statism.  This is partly because it
<br>
becomes harder to externalize the costs and much easier to see what the
<br>
problem is.  (In a large country like the US, it's easy, e.g., for the Fed
<br>
to inflate, but if the city of Wilmington, Delaware were a separate country,
<br>
the Bank of Wilmington would find it much harder to inflate its currency
<br>
given the effects would be much more readily noticeable and traceable to the
<br>
inflationary policy.  In the US, even now, some people think there was no
<br>
inflationary boom during the 1990s that lead to the current bust.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
