<p>Actually, it is in the interest of each side to follow the rules and
<br>
complain about the other side not doing so. If A violates a convention
<br>
and B complains, it must be documented by a neutral third party, i.e.
<br>
the international red cross, before B can regard itself as free of the
<br>
constraints of that convention. This is why Germany always gussied up
<br>
it's POWs and gave them all the blankets, etc before a scheduled Red
<br>
Cross visit: it wanted to continue to abuse allied prisoners but wanted
<br>
the allies to treat its german prisoners good. We knew our prisoners
<br>
were abused, but the Red Cross could never document the abuse, so we
<br>
were bound to treat the Germans in our POW camps well: we were too open
<br>
a society to get away with the same sort of duplicity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have not read the Geneva convention but I'd have thought that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country signing it binds them to act accordingly, not that both parties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be signatories for it to apply. Although, we are talking war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, so it may well be full of loopholes.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the Geneva Conventions (there were several) say that if one
<br>
country operates outside the rules, or tosses them out entirely (or
<br>
never signs them), then the rules don't apply to the other side either
<br>
(as evident in the case of combatants using non-combatants as shields).
