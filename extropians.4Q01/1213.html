<p>
The era of &quot;laptop&quot; surgery has begun.
<br>
<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/09/0919_robotsurgery.html">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/09/0919_robotsurgery.html</a>
<br>
In a medical milestone that will eventually move major surgery beyond the
<br>
operating room and into areas all around the world, French and U.S. scientists
<br>
performed a trans-oceanic operation completely by remote control.
<br>
<p>Surgeon's Long Arms
<br>
A surgical team operating at a console in New York sent instructions to a set
<br>
of robotic arms that removed the gallbladder of a patient across the Atlantic
<br>
in Strasbourg, France.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operating surgeons were in New York, the patient in Strasbourg, France.
<br>
Through a high-quality telecommunications circuit, the doctors in New York
<br>
guided the movements of a three-armed robot in Strasbourg-about 6,230
<br>
kilometers (3,870 miles) away-that removed the gallbladder of a 68-year-old
<br>
woman.
<br>
<p>One of the robotic arms held a camera probe like those now used in many common
<br>
medical procedures to examine internal areas of the body and guide surgery on
<br>
internal organs-a technique known as laparoscopy. The other two arms wielded
<br>
the surgical instruments.
<br>
<p>Other surgeons stood by in Strasbourg to make sure the operation went
<br>
smoothly. The procedure, which was done September 7, took 54 minutes. The
<br>
patient recovered without complications and went home two days later,
<br>
according to the medical team.
<br>
<p>The researchers announced the successful results at a news conference
<br>
Wednesday in Paris. A report on the pioneering operation will be published in
<br>
the September 27 issue of Nature, but the journal posted the information early
<br>
on its Web site.
<br>
<p>Although it will take many years before the technology is commercially
<br>
available, the researchers say it opens the way to an era of fully
<br>
interconnected medicine and surgery without borders.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a gallbladder operation today, but in the future it could be any kind of
<br>
medical procedure,&quot; said team member Michael Gagner, chief of the Department
<br>
of Laparascopic Surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.
<br>
<p>Along with Jacques Marescaux of the University of Strasbourg and the IRCAD
<br>
European Institute of Telesurgery, Gagner was at the console in New York where
<br>
the surgeons transmitted instructions to the robot.
<br>
<p>&quot;As the technology evolves and becomes available, and wiring is more
<br>
widespread, it will be useful for telementoring, teaching, and performing rare
<br>
surgery that requires different expertise,&quot; Gagner added. &quot;A smaller city
<br>
could have the help of an expert surgeon just by being connected.&quot;
<br>
<p>As the technology becomes portable, it should also be possible to perform
<br>
complex surgery even at remote disaster sites and battlefields, when response
<br>
time is critical, and in developing countries that have few or no surgeons,
<br>
the researchers say.
<br>
<p>&quot;The idea of telecollaborative surgery is hugely important because of the
<br>
tremendous positive societal impact,&quot; said Yulun Wang, the founder and chief
<br>
technical officer of Computer Motion Inc. in Goleta, California.
<br>
<p>Computer Motion developed the robotic system-called ZEUS-that was used in the
<br>
trans-Atlantic operation. FranceTelecom/Equant was also a partner in the
<br>
project, responsible for ensuring the transfer of information via a high-speed
<br>
optical-fiber network.
<br>
<p>Tool, Not &quot;Smart&quot; Machine
<br>
Robotics and long-distance &quot;telesurgery&quot; are increasingly being used to give
<br>
surgeons a helping hand in the operating room, especially for unusually
<br>
complex procedures or those that require greater dexterity. But the
<br>
trans-Atlantic surgery is the first time a robot has held the surgical
<br>
instruments and done a complete operation.
<br>
<p>The surgical robot is not a &quot;smart&quot; machine, guided by artificial
<br>
intelligence, but only a tool, the researchers emphasized. &quot;All judgments and
<br>
movements must be done by surgeons,&quot; Gagner said. &quot;The robots were doing
<br>
exactly what we told them to do from here in New York.&quot;
<br>
<p>Two surgeons were by the patient's side in Strasbourg to intervene if there
<br>
were complications. One had his foot on an emergency pedal, said Steven
<br>
Butner, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University
<br>
of California-Santa Barbara who helped Wang and others at Computer Motion
<br>
design the robotic system. &quot;If he took his foot off the pedal, the robot would
<br>
freeze and he could take over,&quot; Butner said.
<br>
<p>The trans-Atlantic surgery was done after nearly two years of work to refine
<br>
ZEUS, overcome technical limitations, and get approval from oversight agencies
<br>
in France and the United States to use the remote robot to operate on a human
<br>
patient.
<br>
<p>So far the technology is allowed only for investigational use. The medical
<br>
team obtained the patient's consent and also had to acquire the go-ahead from
<br>
an ethical committee that reviewed the proposed procedure.
<br>
<p>Gagner said a gallbladder operation was chosen as the first test procedure
<br>
because it's a &quot;landmark&quot; step in training doctors to perform laparascopic
<br>
surgery. &quot;When trained in laparascopy, it's usually the first procedure
<br>
doctors do because on average it's a relatively simple operation,&quot; he said.
<br>
&quot;It involves removing tissue only, not reconstructing.&quot;
<br>
<p>One of the most important issues the engineers had to address was a time lag
<br>
in the transmission of signals from the surgeon's console to the operating
<br>
room and back-a problem known as latency.
<br>
<p>This latency, or delayed response, is critically important in remote surgery,
<br>
Butner noted, because the operating physicians are able to use only vision to
<br>
guide their movements. They lack an advantage we have in performing most
<br>
physical tasks when we rely in part on sensations to guide our
<br>
actions-applying a bolt, for example, and knowing from a sense of touch when
<br>
it's tight enough.
<br>
<p>Any electronic signal entails some delay in transmission of the data and
<br>
conversion into a form that's readable to the recipients. The researchers had
<br>
to determine how much of a delayed response surgeons could tolerate and still
<br>
do a remote operation effectively. &quot;We needed to minimize the time lag so the
<br>
surgeon sees the motion of the robot with minimal latency,&quot; Butner said.
<br>
<p>Data travelling between the two locations made a round trip of more than
<br>
14,000 kilometers.
<br>
<p>To determine the acceptable threshold of latency, the researchers artificially
<br>
altered the time lag of the operations between New York and Strasbourg as
<br>
surgeons used the robotic technology to remove the gallbladders of several
<br>
experimental pigs.
<br>
<p>&quot;From those experiments we found that surgeons had great confidence in the
<br>
procedure, the robots ran well. So we wanted to test the procedure in a human
<br>
operation,&quot; Butner said.
<br>
<p>The time required for the transfer and video-coding of data meant that
<br>
movements executed by the operating surgeon in New York were visible to him on
<br>
his video screen 155 milliseconds later. That delay beat the estimated safe
<br>
lag time of 330 milliseconds.
<br>
<p>Leading-Edge Technology
<br>
Laparoscopy revolutionized the field of medicine over the past decade. It's
<br>
now widely used for many common surgical procedures, such as treating colon,
<br>
prostate, and fertility problems.
<br>
<p>The technique is popular because it's minimally invasive, usually requiring
<br>
only a small incision through which to insert a camera scope and surgical
<br>
tools.
<br>
<p>According to Wang, flexible fiber-optic scopes are typically used to examine
<br>
or treat ailments of organs such as the throat and colon. For thoracic and
<br>
abdominal procedures, in which body cavities are larger and surgeons have more
<br>
room to manipulate tools, the scopes are often rigid and use fixed lenses to
<br>
transmit light. A rigid scope with lenses, which is used in the ZEUS robot,
<br>
has the advantage of producing higher-resolution images than are possible with
<br>
fiber-optic probes.
<br>
<p>Further improving the quality of surgical treatment today is the power and
<br>
precision of robotics.
<br>
&quot;Robots enhance the capability of surgeons by enabling them to do procedures
<br>
more evenly and precisely,&quot; said Butner. Robots can be programmed to perform
<br>
micro-motions such as making sutures that are much smaller than those of human
<br>
surgeons and filtering out inherent human tremors for &quot;rock-steady movement,&quot;
<br>
he pointed out.
<br>
<p>Moreover, automation enables surgeons to do more complicated and intricate
<br>
procedures, Gagner said. &quot;Robots will work beautifully at different angles,
<br>
locations, and cavities where it may be difficult for human surgeons to
<br>
maneuver or work without becoming fatigued,&quot; he explained.
<br>
<p>The trans-oceanic gallbladder operation sets the stage for the next level of
<br>
sophistication in laparoscopic surgery. &quot;This is very much the leading edge of
<br>
minimally invasive surgery,&quot; said Butner.
<br>
<p>Until now, long-distance surgical assistance has been limited mainly to
<br>
&quot;telemonitoring,&quot; the researchers say. And only parts of the surgical process
<br>
have been automated.
<br>
<p>&quot;In the past, a remote surgeon has been able to collaborate with an on-site
<br>
surgeon, consulting with that [operating] surgeon and providing assistance
<br>
such as guiding the camera,&quot; said Wang. &quot;But this is the first time a complete
<br>
remote telesurgical operation has been done.&quot;
<br>
<p>Wang and his collaborators are especially hopeful that the new technology will
<br>
help raise health standards around the world and make medical expertise more
<br>
widely available.
<br>
<p>&quot;This could be especially important in Third World countries where there are
<br>
no surgeons or very few,&quot; said Gagner. &quot;We could have surgeons donating their
<br>
time operating in other countries.&quot;
<br>
<p>To overcome the lack of sufficient cable connections, he suggested, it may be
<br>
possible in the future to send signals by satellite or microwave. And once the
<br>
technology is portable enough to be transported by boat or plane, nurses and
<br>
physicians in other regions of the world could be trained to position the
<br>
surgical robot.
<br>
<p>Said Gagner: &quot;It will be a kind of laptop technology in the future.&quot;
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
