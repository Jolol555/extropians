<p>I have examined this data in the past. I notice that this study examines
<br>
crime rates in large cities of the different countries. This, therefore
<br>
does not accurately impunge legal gun ownership, since most all of the
<br>
large cities in the US greatly restrict gun use by law abiding citizens.
<br>
Note also that the study only has data for West Germany up to 1992, not
<br>
Germany as a whole. East Germany's inclusion from 1992 onward results in
<br>
a boost in crime rates of around 20%, and given that East Germany has
<br>
had far more restrictive gun laws than West Germany, this confirms my
<br>
own assertions.
<br>
<p>As I have previously said (and you've ignored), there are distinctly
<br>
different jurisdictions in the US with significantly different firearms
<br>
laws. Vermont, for example, allows EVERYONE, including felons, to carry
<br>
concealed weapons, yet has a lower violent crime rate than any nation in
<br>
the world. New Hampshire's law says it is the right of every law abiding
<br>
citizen to receive a CCW permit that requests one, within 14 days of
<br>
application, and our crime rates are as low as Vermont's, despite being
<br>
on the border of some of the most high-crime cities in Massachusetts (a
<br>
state which highly restrictes firearms ownership).
<br>
<p>Chicago and Washington DC have the highest violent crime rates in the
<br>
world, and contribute the largest share of violent crime in the US, and
<br>
ban gun ownership outright. As I've said, in order to properly compare
<br>
the US to other nations, you need to separate the US into two types of
<br>
jurisdictions (as Prof. John Lott did), plus you must also account for
<br>
the measurably different demographic makeup of the US vs that of
<br>
Germany, Japan, Australia, and Britain. I, in fact have done this in the
<br>
past, on this list, and demonstrated that the violent crime rates in
<br>
those parts of the US which widely permit gun use AND more accurately
<br>
mirror the demographic patterns of these other countries, those areas of
<br>
the US have far lower violent crime rates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the right to bear arms - especially concealed guns - is so important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have a low crime rate, why is the rate of violent crimes so much higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US than in other countries? Do you have a proven explanation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this or can we simply drop this theme, because fire arms are in no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman or extropian, but only inappropriate tools from our barbaric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, firearms, as technological instruments of individual
<br>
empowerment, are extropic. Since firearms were first invented less than
<br>
500 years ago, there is nothing barbaric about them. They are children
<br>
of the Rennaissance and Englightenment.
<br>
<p>What is not extropic is to continue to believe that it is in some way
<br>
just to prevent law abiding citizens from defending themselves against
<br>
criminals, who never obey the law, even gun laws.
<br>
<p>What is barbaric is to assume that anyone should have the power to
<br>
tyrannically force individuals to behave as defenseless sheep.
<br>
<p>If you do wish to discuss this, it is more properly dealt with on the
<br>
exi-freedom list on YahooGroups, which all are invited to join.
