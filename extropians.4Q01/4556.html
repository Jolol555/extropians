<em>&gt; &gt; You may then wonder, why such a small state as Israel still stands and

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kai, this is what could be called a &quot;strong assertion&quot;.  From an
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; What was/is the ratio of U.S. aid to Israel vs. Egypt?  What is the level

<br>
Population                    6,173,000     22,474,000   69,080,000

<br>
<p>Development aid does not include money send by foreign workers or so.
<br>
<p>My question: When Israel has such a high standard of living (GDP/person) 
<br>
and can afford[1] a large military service[2] with modern high-tech 
<br>
weapons, why does it receive 6.43 times more development aid per person  
<br>
than Egypt and 11.8 times more than Afghanistan? What is paid from this 
<br>
money? Food? Houses? Education? Weapons?
<br>
<p>To the official amount come the donations from jewish communities. The head 
<br>
organization in the USA writes: &quot;United Jewish Communities represents 189 
<br>
Jewish federations, 400 independent communities and 700,000 people across 
<br>
North America, who contribute more than $2 billion every year to help 
<br>
repair the world.&quot; (<a href="http://www.uja.com/aboutus_home.html">http://www.uja.com/aboutus_home.html</a>)
<br>
<p>Please don't get me wrong, I find it amazing what Israel has achieved since 
<br>
1948 in terms of turning desert into acres. I just find that development 
<br>
aid should be spend first, where people need it most.
<br>
<p>[1] Israel: 20.7% of the national budget, USA: 16.2%.
<br>
[2] 172.500 persons = 2.8% of the population, compared to the USA 
<br>
(1.365.800p = 0.4% of the population)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So?  The U.N. from where we sit in the U.S. has been known to promote the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agendas of &quot;small&quot; powers against the &quot;large&quot; powers for many years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the general assembly it is 1 country = 1 vote;
</em><br>
<p>You are right, but I didn't write about the general assembly but about the 
<br>
security council.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *My* reaction (in the archives) to the 911 attacks was &quot;knee-jerk&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The U.S. response has been quite measured IMO.
</em><br>
<p>... much to the astonishment of most of the worlds population, I'm afraid 
<br>
to say.
<br>
<p>But Samantha and I didn't write about the reaction on the terror attacks, 
<br>
but about the unconditional support for only one side (Israel), while 
<br>
mostly ignoring the rest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you, Samantha, et al should read how the Jordanian government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last dealt with an extremist group within its country.  If my reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the NY Times is accurate, they shelled it into dust.  So their methods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are certainly not any more extreme than U.S. methods.
</em><br>
<p>A crime can not be justified by another. This is a simple rule of modern 
<br>
law. Otherwise we would have many bad examples in history to justify almost 
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p>What I was trying to explain was that there is already a war-like situation 
<br>
in the middle east for years now, which Mr. Jones apparently didn't know. I 
<br>
don't think that the US government didn't know that. I must therefore 
<br>
assume, that the actively ignored it. Pres. Bush even tried to step outside 
<br>
the discussion, until he found out that the others won't let him escape.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The $ amount ($40B) sounds quite high.  But whether it could buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan bears some examination.  The Y2000 Afghanistan GDP was $21 B.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Typically one purchases assets based on productivity over time (this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the stock market values companies).  So assuming something like a 10%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ROI it would have required an investment of $210 billion to &quot;purchase&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan &quot;productively&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p>I apologize. I have overstressed my rethoric... So, you are right, the 
<br>
money spend to bomb the rest of Afghanistan into pieces, scatter thousands 
<br>
of refugees across the land to find a single villain is only twice the GDP 
<br>
of this land or 26 times the development aid it received in 2000. (you 
<br>
might detect a little irony here...)
<br>
<p>Don't you think that a small part of this money spent in 1995/96 would have 
<br>
been sufficient to guide this country towards stability and democracy? Do 
<br>
you understand my point now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the major export of Afghanistan is opium, 
</em><br>
<p>Afghanistan has large resources of natural gas, coal and copper. The 
<br>
license for the planned gas pipeline alone would bring over $150Mio per 
<br>
year. Establish an economics where the afghan people can exploit these 
<br>
resources and really earn that money (instead of Exxon or Shell). This 
<br>
would eliminate the wish to produce opium.
