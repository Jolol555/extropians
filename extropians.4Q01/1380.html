Somebody (perhaps Joe Dees, perhaps not, hard to tell) wrote:
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; in February the Hajj will open to the news of 6 million plus dead Afghans.
</em><br>
<p>Then lets hurry up and kill the Taliban scum who stop the food trucks and
<br>
imprison relief workers.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;And it will be portrayed and believed to be largely the fault of the US.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you there, in the Islamic world the US is blamed for everything,
<br>
including the Soviets invading Afghanistan, internal tribal squabbling, medieval
<br>
religious practices and the fact that it gets dark at night. There is no point in
<br>
worrying over the fact that the Islamic world hates us, they will do that regardless
<br>
of what we do and we should just get on with doing what we have to do to defend
<br>
ourselves. If the Islamic world is angry that we don't have the good manners to
<br>
die that's just tough.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;the US is perceived by a vast majority of Muslims as being something reprehensible.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;The reason for this is primarily because of our ongoing support for Israel
</em><br>
<p>The US support of Israel  certainly doesn't help and I think our foreign policy has been far
<br>
too one sided but I don't believe for one second that can explain the intense hatred of America
<br>
that can be seen from Algeria to Indonesia. In that part of the world the nickname for the USA
<br>
is &quot;The Great Satan&quot;, but in Islam Satan is not an all powerful conqueror, he is a tempter,
<br>
a seducer. The thing they really hate is popular culture, they hate the fact that the most
<br>
popular show in Iran seen on satellite and bootleg tapes is &quot;Bay watch&quot;. They fear
<br>
Brittany Spears more that a Apache attack helicopter.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Given his  [Bin Laden] success in all  of these areas, the man is nobody's fool.
</em><br>
<p>He's no fool but he's not a superman either. I think the probability of him being
<br>
alive one year from today is very low, although definite proof of his death may
<br>
never surface.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Two key differences between Afghanistan and Pakistan exist. Once we
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;examine Pakistan's forces, we know that the number of Islamic
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;fundamentalists in Pakistan's forces exceeds 30% of the total muster.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;And we know that Pakistan has an arsenal of possibly 30 nuclear weapons.
</em><br>
<p>Another difference is that Afghanistan, like all those willing to support Bin Laden
<br>
with deeds and not just words, has nothing to lose and that's what makes them so
<br>
dangerous. Pakistan on the other hand has a lot to lose.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;There are a number of possible outcomes, to this battle. One might be that the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; fundamentalists succeed in taking over the country - and her nuclear arsenal.
</em><br>
<p>The USA knows where the arsenal is stored, I am sure that at the slightest indication
<br>
that fundamentalists are about to take over an Army Delta team will grab them and
<br>
the Air force will bomb the production factories. Yes, Islam will hate us for doing that,
<br>
but they already do and always will.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The above could well lead to a war of attrition that would destabilize
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the US and probably cause her to withdraw from global interaction -
</em><br>
<p>Before September 11 that was possible but not now, even massive casualties
<br>
will not prevent the USA from getting bin Laden's head on a stick.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Possible? Likely? If anything, I suspect that this scenario is optimistic.
</em><br>
<p>Oh for heaven's sake. Do you think this is the first crises the world has seen,
<br>
or the worst? Sure things are bad, but it's a walk in the park compared with the
<br>
Cuban Missile Crises or Hitler invading Poland.
