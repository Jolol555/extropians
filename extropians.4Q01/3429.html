</em><br>
This version of the categorical imperative may not be used to attack human
<br>
cloning per se but it can be used to argue against this technology _if_ we
<br>
grant that the &quot;stuff&quot; from which we hope to harvest the stem cells should
<br>
be treated as a distinct person. If we kill off the stuff after we have
<br>
harvested the stem cells then clearly we are treating it as a means and not
<br>
as an end in itself. If we accept the Kantian imperative and that it is
<br>
right to harvest stem cells from this stuff, then the stuff cannot be a
<br>
person. For Kant this is a categorical imperative which means that all the
<br>
talk in the world about health benefits will not override our duty not to
<br>
treat people as mere means. This sort of consequentialist thinking is what
<br>
Kant wanted to avoid. (Perhaps I misunderstand Anders here. Does the
<br>
sentence which starts &quot;It seems that this....: mean that they do not hold
<br>
this misinterpretation of Kant or that they do not hold to Kant's
<br>
deontological position?)
