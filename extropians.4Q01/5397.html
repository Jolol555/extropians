</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>The best solution, absent a Singularity and the plenty it might bring,
<br>
is to adopt free market policies throughout the globe, including a
<br>
respect for individual negative rights, especially property rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Query: As we reach hyper-abundance and most manufacturing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near totally automated, exactly why would you require every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adult to have a normal job in order to have a stake in and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to that plenty?  It is quite easy to see there would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no meaningful work for them that anyone would care to hire them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for not far down the road at all.  What then?  In a world of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty why is scarcity based thinking concerning &quot;earning&quot; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living appropriate?
</em><br>
<p>I think if such a period of plenty comes about, then a lot of things
<br>
will change and it will be hard now to predict the exact course.  Plenty
<br>
is also a relative term, since what is plenty to one person might be not
<br>
enough to another.  I think, however, economic concerns might switch to
<br>
other areas, but see below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I think the thing holding the Third World back is not the lack of
</em><br>
First
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; World foreign aid, but the lack of respect for property rights (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Hernando De Soto's -- the Peruvian economist NOT the Spanish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a world where all material items (except fixed land resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on) can be had simply by asking the local nanobots to dig
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up the pattern and produce it, what exactly would property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights apply to and why would you care?
</em><br>
<p>First, we're not there yet and free markets work right now.  No need for
<br>
much R &amp; D on that front, just implement them and the benefits will
<br>
come.:)
<br>
<p>Second, given nanotech, scarcity will not necessarily disappear, but
<br>
move to other areas, such as information.  (Of course, nanocomputing
<br>
might make it less and less necessary to get good new designs from
<br>
others.  If that's the case, as trade declines, society will probably be
<br>
less and less society and more and more just a bunch of loose
<br>
affiliations.  Or so I speculate!)
<br>
<p>Also, the Lockean-Randian justification for private property is that
<br>
humans need material resources to live.  In other words, property is
<br>
grounded in life.  Nanotech does not erase that need.  You can still die
<br>
or be denied things.  It will be much harder and the incentives for
<br>
crime and conflict will definitely shift -- probably eliminating a lot
<br>
of rivalries and the like, but not all of them.
<br>
<p>Okay, I've got a lot of studying to do -- unless that Singularity gets
<br>
here quick!:)
