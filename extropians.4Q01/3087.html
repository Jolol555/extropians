Jacques posted some thoughts on selection by migration
<br>
which J.R. poured at least some water on.
<br>
<p>I've observed the effect that Jacques discusses in the
<br>
U.S. -- historically the less risk averse migrated West.
<br>
In modern times one tends to see young people migrate
<br>
to the less conservative coasts, esp. say New York,
<br>
San Francisco, or L.A.
<br>
<p>What I think is at work is a &quot;risk aversion&quot; or &quot;adventure
<br>
embracing&quot; gene (or genes).  Migrating always has risks
<br>
associated with attempting to survive in unknown environment.
<br>
At the same time it may provide the opportunity to gather more
<br>
resources (enrich oneself) and therefore support larger numbers
<br>
of offspring.  From a prehistoric perspective, apes
<br>
had to learn to migrate to regions of the forest where
<br>
food sources became available at different times of the
<br>
year (this generated our mental ability to recall &quot;maps&quot;
<br>
most likely).  As man became more of a meat eater he had to
<br>
migrate to follow the animals.  However migration
<br>
(unless one is following paths which the tribe
<br>
discovered previously to be safe) *is* risky.
<br>
<p>So in ape societies where the Alpha males dominate
<br>
the mating opportunities, there may be an advantage
<br>
for the non-alphas to migrate -- perhaps discovering
<br>
a &quot;tribe&quot; where there may be mating opportunities.
<br>
A better strategy is to select an immature female
<br>
and &quot;elope&quot; to a new location and start a new tribe
<br>
(where one is the alpha male).
<br>
<p>Because migrating to new regions, eloping, etc. to
<br>
is risky it has to be balanced against the reproductive
<br>
advantages it might provide.  So I think evolution would
<br>
develop two alleles for risk taking:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;R - take risks and r - don't take risks.
<br>
So a normal population distribution will be:
<br>
rr (25% - never migrate),
<br>
Rr (50% - sometimes migrate -- particularly when
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources are in short supply),
<br>
RR (25% - migrate at the first opportunity or when any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advantage seems likely).
<br>
<p>Obviously if you have three alleles for 1 gene or 2 alleles
<br>
for 2 genes you get an even more interesting fractions and
<br>
patterns of risk tolerance.  The advantages to the genes is
<br>
obvious -- it provides a stable base in a known environment where
<br>
the current gene set is known to &quot;work&quot; while at the same time
<br>
providing mechanisms for spreading the genes to prevent extinction
<br>
in the event of local catastrophes.  The long term application
<br>
of this probably drives speciation as migrating populations
<br>
diverge and become better adapted to new environments.
<br>
<p>In this light, extropians are perhaps turning into a new
<br>
species of humanity.
