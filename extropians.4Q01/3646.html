A singularity-related topic discussed here is the doubling
<br>
time of knowledge.  This is a notoriously difficult metric to
<br>
calculate, for it is unclear what exactly we mean by a doubling
<br>
of knowledge.  Many of us intuitively suspect that prior to the
<br>
singularity, the doubling time will become exceedingly short,
<br>
however we are still open to interpretation exactly what
<br>
is meant by doubling of knowledge.
<br>
<p>Let us propose some kind of metrics to measure how much
<br>
of something is known at what time in history, so we can
<br>
estimate knowledge doubling times.
<br>
<p>Since the largest known prime record was broken two weeks
<br>
ago, I found some historical records regarding the size of the
<br>
largest known prime, then calculated how many seconds it took
<br>
during those time intervals for the size of the largest known prime
<br>
to double.  I get the following.
<br>
<p>date                    seconds to double record
<br>
1994                  600
<br>
03-Sep-96         172
<br>
13-Nov-96         44
<br>
24-Aug-97         16
<br>
27-Jan-98           300
<br>
01-Jun-99           10.7
<br>
14-Nov-01         11.9
<br>
<p>(The anomalous 300 seconds for 27 Jan 98 is a result of a
<br>
curiously short span between M36 and M37.)
<br>
<p>In any case, the doubling time is getting wonderfully short.
<br>
I don't know what this has to do with the singularity, if anything,
<br>
but I had fun calculating it. {8-]   Perhaps Damien will comment
<br>
with respect to his notions on page 86 of The Spike. spike
