<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why is protection of publishing industries more important to American

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How does the 1st Amendment apply? Your right of free expression does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mean you have the right to express other people's expressions without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their consent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It also prohibits derivative works: I cannot produce a translation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptation, or a work in another medium based on a copyrighted work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such as, say, a book comparing short stories by different authors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a rap song sampling differing tunes).
</em><br>
<p>This is inaccurate. Sampling and referenced quotation are entirely
<br>
accepted 'fair use' exceptions. The problem is when you use so much of
<br>
someone elses work in your work that you are essentially creating
<br>
nothing new.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I can't use a song as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soundtrack to a movie, or make a remix, or many other creative things.
</em><br>
<p>Because if you use so much of another's work, your use is not original,
<br>
and therefore is not art, it is reproduction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And this is true even if the artist is long dead and cannot possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit from copyright protection, because most copyrights are owned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by publishing companies.  Just ask anyone who has tried to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergound cartoons with Disnet characters.  Copyright stifles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expression as much, if not more, than it encourages it.  Likewise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patents prevent me from making a minor improvement to an existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invention, or combining inventions in useful ways.
</em><br>
<p>I do not oppose the elimination of corporate ownership of IP.
<br>
Corporations are not senient beings, and therefore cannot be artists.
<br>
The Constitution clearly states that Congress is to protect the
<br>
creators, the artists, not anyone else. However, as an artist, I highly
<br>
oppose the idea that you can take someone else's work and tweak it a
<br>
little to be able to claim it as your own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The 4th? Considering an artist who never makes any money because his art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is stolen by millions of ungrateful fans starves to death, I propose...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That one's been batted out of the park so many times I won't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bother with it, except to say that I'm surprized how many otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarians, who would otherwise never assume that a law actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplishes what the politicians who passed it says it will, are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to assume that copyrights and patents actually accomplish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they claim, or even that the real reasons for their passage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the same as the claimed reasons.  And what do you say, Mr. Lorrey,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the former admins of anon.penet.fi, who used to run a popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anonymization service that was shut down by the feds at the request
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Church of Scientology over copyright issues?  Was that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable seizure of criminal taking money from the pockets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artists?  What do you say to Dmitri Sklyarov, now in jail under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DMCA for publishing security information about a piece of software?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Was that seizure reasonable?
</em><br>
<p>Scientology is obviously trying to have their cake and eat it. They
<br>
claim their work is 'art' to protect its proprietary value in skinning
<br>
marks, yet also claim it is historical truth and religious dogma to
<br>
protect themselves against taxation and fraud charges. Using them as an
<br>
example has likewise been batted out of the park so many times that I'm
<br>
rather surprised you are using it here, Lee.
<br>
<p>The DMCA is obviously a flawed law that needs legal precedents to
<br>
eliminate its problems. I personally wouldn't mind eliminating the right
<br>
of corporations to own IP.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The 5th? dont' see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure I see his point there either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The 10th? that is states rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...and the unenumerated rights of the people.  Such as the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human right to use the information in your head to improve your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, without having to know where every little piece of it came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from or which uses are legal and which aren't.
</em><br>
<p>Usage is fine. If you posess the information, you should know where you
<br>
got if from, and it is rather easy to understand what uses are legal and
<br>
which are not. Only con artists would try to claim otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One could say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intellectual property rights, because they exist within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; constitution, are the 0th Amendment rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That section of the constitution enumerates the rights of congress,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of which is the right to make laws estabishing intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights.  It does not require them to do so, it only allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to (and they have chosesn to pass such laws).  The Bil of Rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enumerates those things that congress _cannot_ legislate away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people, because they are basic human rights.  When sections of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the constitution conflict, the courts and congress are expected to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compromise.  It is not at all unreasonable to suggest that present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copyright law should be re-evaluated in the light of its effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on free speech and other rights.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, not quite. The Bill of Rights is not the only part which defines the
<br>
rights of individuals. The right to vote, for example, is defined within
<br>
the body of the Constitution. The preamble also defines a right of the
<br>
people to reconstruct the government, to replace one that has grown
<br>
tyrannical.
<br>
<p>Similarly, copyright is now recognised as a constitutional right of the
<br>
individual. You don't need to register a copyright in order to hold one
<br>
on your works. Getting your work notarized by any other means (Justice
<br>
of the Peace, court clerk, postmark, etc) also acts as an informal
<br>
registration, since in IP disputes, the date of creation is of key
<br>
importance (as is degree of exposure).
