<em>&gt; &gt; Well, you have definitely given it a Extropian spin, but what you are

<em>&gt;saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is true.  And I am thankful that other people are starting to notice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happening. But its more than just corporations. Our system is somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; broken, It works better than the 3rd world, but it needs to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overhauled.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A new constitution needs to be written, but I daresay that with the

<em>&gt;present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power money has over our govt, it could wind up worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, *technology*, not nanotech is needed. We need a more transparent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;govt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, we need less laws, and we could get by on only a few laws passed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; year. So why not just upgrade our voting system with technology, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the citizenry vote on all laws?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe have sunset clauses (expiration dates, like on milk) be the norm, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any law the legislature presumes to elevate to timeless relevance would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to have some kind of supermajority in order to pass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As a practical matter, where technology is threatening to blow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doors off the outhouse and hose is clean is in the area of privacy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free expression. That's why they're fighting it tooth and nail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've said this before and will probably say it many more times: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number one low entry cost way to defeat bloated statism/corporatism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to use and promote the use of crypto, anonymous cash, and anonymous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communications wherever possible-- preferrably with large number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals rather than with organizations (you get better bargains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that way too).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As I was reading Bob Black's essays (quite a character-- he's kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a leftilist, but he's right on target where authoritarinism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concerned) I came upon another way to fight dumb laws: a jury's power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to NULLIFY laws, and effectively to acquit a defendant in a criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case for ANY reason they collectively feel like. The best kept secret
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the legal profession. Want out of jury duty? Breathe a word of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;during jury selection, and you'll be driving back to your regularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scheduled job within twenty minutes. So method number two is making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sure as many US citizens know about the power of nullification as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible. For more info, see:

<p><p>William Pierce, the hardcore NeoNazi, once wrote that the Jews are people 
<br>
farmers.  Well, that's kinda true in a way, both now and in the past, for 
<br>
historical reasons.  Well, of course, most Jews are just ordinary people. 
<br>
However, he definitely has a point about people farming with respect to how 
<br>
our govt is run, and I supppose how govt's have always been run, except in 
<br>
certain uncommon periods and places.
<br>
But it's funny that our govt's reaction teh recent terorism has NOT been to 
<br>
clamp down on keeping OUT possible terrorists(closing the border), but 
<br>
INSTEAD to clamp down on US, the putative OWNERS of this country, via 
<br>
proposals to &quot;monitor the Internet&quot;,etc.
<br>
<p>We are being farmed, people. Many people, when confronted with these facts, 
<br>
just say, &quot;well, some people are farmed, other are farmers. I plan on being 
<br>
a farmer.&quot;
<br>
Well, that's nice, but the lottery has neever favored the player.
