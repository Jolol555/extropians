<p>I am saying generally that no country has the right to interfere

<p>### How about when a few of percent of the population, mainly well-armed
<br>
young men, engage in the wholesale slaughter of large numbers citizens of
<br>
that country (let's say, 5 000 to 10 000/day, as in Rwanda a few years ago,
<br>
or in Cambodia)? Are we ethically bound not to interfere? Do you think that
<br>
the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, which ended the slaughter, was an
<br>
immoral act? (plese answer yes or no) Or was the total indifference to
<br>
Rwanda the ethically correct approach?
<br>
<p>As you point out later, noninterference is usually conducive to peace but,
<br>
as Neville Chamberlain's mistake shows, sometimes peace is worse than war.

<p>Afghanistan did not attack us.  Terrorists did.  No matter how
<br>
you twist it, there is a bit of a difference.
<br>
<p>### The US attacked the terrorists and their government backers, not
<br>
Afghanistan's people.

<p>law and diplomacy today.  If you say that we are charged with
the job of protecting/securing individual rights globally or at
least have every right to do so then this is tantamount to a
declaration of nearly global war.
<p>### No, this is in fact the declaration of the Pax Americana: &quot;If you kill
enough innocent people, we'll come and bomb you, especially if you also make
us lose too much money&quot;.
