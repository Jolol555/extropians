<p>OK, Mike of Borg will use his pocket nuke connected to whether his
<br>
nose starts running or not: if it starts to run, poff goes the
<br>
neighbourhood. If not, no big-badda-boom.
<br>
<p>This will surely mean that everyone will try to keep his nose dry?
<br>
<p>Or Benny of Borg will wire his pocket nuke to explode when people
<br>
are nasty to him, in an effort for a friendlier society.
<br>
<p>This will surely mean that everyone will be polite around him?
<br>
<p>If you don't like these two examples, The Borg have several others. |-]
<br>
<p>Now, feel free to state your comments. &quot;The audience is listening.&quot;
