<br>
<p>Gimme a fuckin break or I'll force you to answer 10 easy Qs. about Aussies
<br>
rules
<br>
<p>9 Who or what:
<br>
<p>2 is the Lone Star's flower? 
<br>
<p>Ah, one for Barbara Lamar and Greg Burch
<br>
<p>9 Who or what:
<br>
<p>9 signals impending departure? 
<br>
<p>Um, the rising incidence of gun posts on the extrope list?
<br>
<p>10 What is:
<br>

<br>
<p>Don't nag
<br>
<p>14 Which Old Testament Book:

<br>
in infancy?
<br>
<p>Hercules had that problem very early but he wasn't a twin I think.
<br>
<p>8 were the children of John Brooke and Meg March? 
<br>
<p>`Little Mother Meg', you mean? Damned if I know
<br>
<p>Harder than they look, these things.
