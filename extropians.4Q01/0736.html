<p><p>On the charge of &quot;Magical Thinking 1&quot; I plead guilty, your honour. The
<br>
thread has helped me understand better the nature of the phenomena. The
<br>
variety of different approaches/views is wonderful. As a one-time member of
<br>
'skeptics' I am as down on ill-informed conjecture as anyone. My thought
<br>
process is really about..&quot;Here we have a real effect- action at a distance
<br>
without delay - &quot; and although it's behaviour is infuriating we are at the
<br>
very beginnings of exposure and do not want to stop trying because a QM
<br>
model says you can't, no matter how fantastically solid it has been in the
<br>
face of endless experimentation. Give to kids and they'll break it.  :) Ah I
<br>
remember those days when I knew everything. All that happens now is that I
<br>
learn a little more about how little I know.
<br>
<p>If I may ramble a little longer...35 years ago.....

&quot;Captain Kirk flips open his communicator and says 'Beam me up, scotty'&quot;.
<br>
<em>&gt;From here I can see my daughter's Ericsson mobile phone (cellphone if you

must) with the flipper/answering system.
<br>
<p>&quot;Mr Spock inserts the flat square object into the radio transmitter and
<br>
replays his messages of deception to the Enterprise&quot;. I am seated next to a
<br>
pile of floppy disks almost exactly the same size.
<br>
<p>&quot;Please sign here Captain&quot;..the ensign hands the box like object to Captain
<br>
Kirk, who signs it and hands. it back.   My PDA sits nearby. Smaller,
<br>
smarter.

<p>&quot;Subspace message from Star Fleet, Captain&quot;. Uhura alerts the bridge.

........	next?
<br>
<p>Seems a little silly to generalise out of what seemed then fantastic science
<br>
*fiction*, but sometimes things can work out. The final lines of your last
<br>
paragraph are, I think, the way through this and the person(s) who set up
<br>
this subspace plumbing .....where's the IPO...I want shares now!
