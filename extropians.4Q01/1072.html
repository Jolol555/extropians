Subject: Big government (Was: Re: Anthrax addendum.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Above all, remember that government is not a fact of life, not a force
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of nature, just another institution that we built, and that we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    dismantle once it has completely outlived its usefulness.
</em><br>
<p>This statement points to the emergence of big government, and I wonder how
<br>
many people think that governments are mere artifacts of human invention,
<br>
which can be replaced (by what?). Big government, like metropolitan urban
<br>
sprawl, emerges not at the whim nor the will of the people, but rather as a
<br>
result of forces that scientists do not yet fully understand. For background
<br>
on this, check out the following book, which argues that government (among
<br>
other things) emerges extropically (via self-organization and spontaneous
<br>
order).
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;A new book sets out a radical theory about urban development
<br>
<a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,74-2001350094,00.html">http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,74-2001350094,00.html</a>
<br>
Nobody designs truly great cities. They just spring up. As if by magic, they
<br>
develop distinct districts that endure from century to century. Think of the
<br>
silk quarter in Florence, or Savile Row in London. A city seems to pulsate
<br>
with its own rhythm, as if it is a living, breathing organism.
<br>
Steven Johnson would argue that, in some senses, it is. He would say that the
<br>
superorganism of the city mirrors the superorganism of the ant colony, in
<br>
which a collection of individually stupid insects somehow becomes a
<br>
mesmerising, organised whole. Both are examples of emergence, a phenomenon
<br>
where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. Another commonly
<br>
touted example of emergence is consciousness [AKA, self-awareness] which
<br>
appears to arise spontaneously from the fact that billions of nerve cells
<br>
(neurons) in the brain are firing off signals to each other.
<br>
In a new book, called Emergence, Johnson, an American author best known for
<br>
arguing that computer graphics are as culturally important as books or films,
<br>
aims to coax the topic out of science laboratories and into the mainstream.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Self-organization, spontaneous order, and adaptive behavior impel the
<br>
evolution of cities, ant colonies, the Internet, and human brains. So, if one
<br>
looks closely, one may discern that governments emerge similarly, and that
<br>
they could metamorphose into something else again. The ability to ignore or
<br>
discard government would entail becoming truly transhuman, it seems to me, and
<br>
that is something politicians will oppose mightily. So transhumanism will have
<br>
to make politicians extinct. But first we'll need to debunk religiosity, the
<br>
most regressive force now operating in society.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
