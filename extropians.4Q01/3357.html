</em><br>
<em>&gt; so&quot; statements?
</em><br>
<p>I think the basic arguments fall into a number of classes:
<br>
<p>1) Threats against human dignity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- By interfering in the reproductive process humans become
<br>
manufactured rather than just born, and this makes the child subject to
<br>
its parents or whoever is doing the cloning rather than a truly
<br>
independent human being. This weakens human dignity, as virtues and
<br>
flaws become merely features and misfeatures of the &quot;manufacturing&quot; and
<br>
might carry over in other spheres of human culture as a genetization of
<br>
humans. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Kantian ethical idea that humans must be ends in
<br>
themselves, and not tools for other ends is sometimes invoked by
<br>
suggesting that clones are created for other reasons than simply being
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Threats against identity: everybody has a right to an
<br>
identity, and this is threatened by being cloned.
<br>
<p>2) Threats against the natural order.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There is something inherently sacred or otherwise valuable in
<br>
natural reproduction, and this is damaged by cloning. The damage may not
<br>
be directed at the people involved, but could affect others who would
<br>
suffer from living in a world where aspects of the natural order have
<br>
been disrupted.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Bad, undefined things may happen if we transgress certain
<br>
boundaries. This may not be divine retribution but simply unexpected
<br>
side effects. Since some bad things may be very bad certain boundaries
<br>
should never be transgressed. 
<br>
<p>3) Threats against society.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Risks of social stratification, as the wealthy clone
<br>
themselves. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Overcloning of some individuals, possibly reducing genetic
<br>
diversity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Children being reared by neurotic clone-parents trying to make
<br>
them the perfect individuals their originals never were. Or the classic
<br>
misuse scenarios where mad dictators or cults clone people. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Risks of using clones as slave labor or second class
<br>
citizens, or the emergence of a market for stem cells and cloned tissue.
<br>
<p>4) Practical threats to the child
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cloning is likely to produce miscarriages and deformities,
<br>
and in humans certain changes might not become apparent until puberty or
<br>
later, when the clone is already an individual and will suffer from
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><p>This is the main non-trivial ethical arguments I have seen. Some might
<br>
appear silly to this list, but note that even an argument most here
<br>
considers silly can be widely effective (for example the view that
<br>
transgressing the natural is ethically *wrong* and mustn't be done -
<br>
this is a very strong view in some cultures).
<br>
<p>My own responses to these classes:
<br>
<p>Human dignity: Human dignity is not tied to how we were conceived or
<br>
what processes intervened, because it is not tied to biology but rather
<br>
to what it is to be a living, acting, experiencing human. We emerge from
<br>
the impositions of genes and environment in a dynamical process, and we
<br>
are ourselves active participants in this process by our own actions; we
<br>
amplify tiny causes and shape them according to our whims. This means
<br>
that threats to human dignity deal with threats to this process of
<br>
self-becoming, and cannot occur before there is an active self that is
<br>
reaching towards individuality. 
<br>
<p>The manufacturing rather than being born argument is more cultural and
<br>
cannot be dismissed outright. However, it implies that culture will
<br>
always be controlled by technological imperatives rather than the
<br>
reverse (or a more complex interaction). But a biologically determinist
<br>
culture like the one in the film Gattaca is a failure of culture: the
<br>
humanists, scientists and artists shaping the culture have all failed to
<br>
understand and speak up for how genes are only a part of the human
<br>
being, and how this complex interplay make us at the same time random
<br>
and deliberate. In the end, a fear that certain technologies would
<br>
change our culture in bad directions is not enough to power an ethical
<br>
argument against the technology.
<br>
<p>It also presupposes that technological imperatives will always force
<br>
everyone to do the same, not that modern pluralistic societies can
<br>
accept that some people chose one thing and others chose differently. 
<br>
<p>Claiming that identity depends on genetic identity is clearly wrong,
<br>
since we do not view twins as having any special ethical relationship to
<br>
each other beyond kinship. In fact, a genetic basis for identity would
<br>
lead dangerously in the direction of genetic determinism and ignore all
<br>
the evidence of how humans develop - even twins in the same environment
<br>
- into unique beings. Having someone like you is not an imposition on
<br>
your identity. 
<br>
<p><p>The natural order: This is really where the enlightenment tradition runs
<br>
into the romantics and irrationalists. It is a question about values,
<br>
emotions and deeply felt but rather intuitive perceptions of not just
<br>
how the world works but also what it *means*. This is not so much an
<br>
issue of rational debate as showing a better vision of the world than
<br>
the opponent - this is the field of artists and visionaries. 
<br>
<p>I think the argument that we may not do things that disrupt the
<br>
experience of the sacred for others is weak; while we should show
<br>
tolerance and sometimes empathy with others' feelings, allowing them to
<br>
rule us would simply not work since there is no end to the number of
<br>
deeply felt but incompatible concepts of what is acceptable in the
<br>
world. 
<br>
<p>The natural order can be read in many ways. It is not so much an issue
<br>
of how the world is as how we see meaning and pattern in it. I think the
<br>
romantic and religious views of the world have the deep problem of being
<br>
essentially static, making out the world and its internal relations to
<br>
be a fixed structure (often Platonic ideas lurk here). This has some
<br>
disturbing consequences, since this order is usually taken to be the
<br>
template human affairs should be ordered after: everything and everyone
<br>
in their place, and no room for breaking the mold. Of course, not every
<br>
view of a natural order is this static, but even many views that
<br>
emphasize how fluid and changeable everything is seem to have a static
<br>
large-scale view: the Tao is eternal and will never transmute into
<br>
something entirely different. More specifically if we look at the
<br>
western &quot;natural orders&quot; they tend to be hierarchical and based on many
<br>
assumptions in ecology that simply do not hold: there is no fragile
<br>
balance of nature, no unchanging species with fixed roles, but rather a
<br>
huge evolutionary chaotic but self-organizing dynamics. Also, these
<br>
natural orders often tend to separate nature from human activity, making
<br>
humans outsiders or unnatural. I would rather say we are quite natural,
<br>
have developed from a natural basis and what we do is part of the big
<br>
scheme of things, yet another voice in the concert of life. 
<br>
<p>There is also the issue of what is meant by humanity. This is maybe even
<br>
more powerful: we are instantly revulsed when we see humanity being
<br>
warped or hurt, and the concept of almost but not quite human beings
<br>
have great emotional power. Cloning threatens the traditional, safe
<br>
image of what it is to be a human by allowing new forms of reproduction
<br>
and a new &quot;contract of parenthood&quot;. Instead of viewing this as a
<br>
challenge to overcome by extending or refining our concept of humanity
<br>
(which is the path I would prefer to see), many react by suggesting that
<br>
since the traditional humanity has served us well and seems to be common
<br>
sense, it must be *right* - and any deviations and deviants are wrong.
<br>
This kind of ethical conservatism has some rather disturbing effects,
<br>
since it can equally easy be used to restrict the definition of humanity
<br>
and what a valuable human life is towards normality, excluding groups
<br>
such as disabled, people of different ethnicity and so on. I think it is
<br>
better to take the challenge and extend the definition of humanity
<br>
outwards rather than to try to retain a classical concept of it.
<br>
<p>The risk argument is really an argument from ignorance. It is closely
<br>
related to the precautionary principle (never do anything unless you can
<br>
show that it is safe), which as it is usually wielded in the debate
<br>
implies the need for perfect knowledge about every possible risk (and
<br>
since many also believe even imperfect knowledge is impossible it
<br>
becomes an argument for non-action). But it can also be used in a
<br>
deeper, more mystical way as allowing wague concepts of hubris, karma
<br>
and other concepts not normally acceptable in the fairly rationalistic
<br>
ethical forums to sneak in. They are never named, and if pressed the
<br>
person using the argument can always suggest the more rational
<br>
precautionary principle or name a few cases where unexpected risks have
<br>
been discovered later, but the real rhetorical strength lies in the
<br>
wague associations of doom. Here I would say a rational concept of risk
<br>
is far preferrable as a course of action - it makes a far less effective
<br>
rhetorical ploy! - we can use our admittedly imperfect knowledge to make
<br>
a best estimate of risks, which we then update as we learn more. In the
<br>
current situation reproductive cloning does not seem to pose any
<br>
existential risks (in Nick Bostrom's terminology, risks that threaten
<br>
humanity) since it would be very unlikely to be used on large
<br>
populations and the effects would be localized to the clones and their
<br>
closest - risks may still exist, but they are unlikely to take us all
<br>
down.
<br>
<p>The risks to society are easier to deal with, since they can be
<br>
discussed in terms of more observable things like real human behavior,
<br>
economics and politics - which still are very soft and easily
<br>
interpreted into many different ways! But here I think we have already
<br>
seen many good arguments that the risks are fairly small, I do not have
<br>
the time to go through them at length. Even moreso the risks to the
<br>
clone argument is an argument that can be settled using objective
<br>
methods, and will likely be settled in the near future. 
<br>
<p>It should be noted that the social risks issues are really more politics
<br>
than ethics: we allow many antisocial behaviors (such as flaming) while
<br>
regarding them and their consequences as undesirable but not undesirable
<br>
enough to warrant a ban or an ethical case for others to step in and
<br>
forcibly prevent them. 
<br>
<p>To sum up, I think there are valid reasons not to try reproductive
<br>
cloning right now. But that does not mean it is inherently wrong if safe
<br>
methods can be developed. But the cloning opposition is of a different
<br>
opinion, and at its core lies a different concept of what it means to be
<br>
a human, how the natural order should dictate our actions and the idea
<br>
that certain cultural and social states are so bad that they should be
<br>
prevented by preventing technology from being developed rather than
<br>
finding cultural ways of handling them.
