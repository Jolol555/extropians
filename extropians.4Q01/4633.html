<p>past anomalies out of individual human histories. Hence my understanding

settings.
<br>
<p>### Count me as an anomaly - I do not recall ever having any &quot;psychic&quot;
<br>
experiences. I have sometimes feelings of deja vu, mild epiphanies, brief
<br>
unexplained happiness or sadness, minor sensory glitches (illusion of a
<br>
small buglike object moving in the periphery of vision, a sense of time
<br>
skipping when I am driving while tired) but I interpret these as minor
<br>
malfunctions of my brain, entirely within the normal range. 
<br>
<p>I do meet patients with anatomically defined CNS abnormalities who describe
<br>
subjective experiences identical to experiences which were evoked by direct
<br>
electrical stimulation of exposed cerebral cortex. Sometimes I can find a
<br>
direct correspondence between the structural abnormality seen on MRI and the
<br>
described experience. Many patients with epilepsy have various emotionally
<br>
laden episodes, some of which sound very much like &quot;spirituality&quot;, and their
<br>
occurrence is correlated with electrical evidence of seizures on EEG. As
<br>
many as 1/3 of our inpatients are verifiably lying about whatever they
<br>
experience, as shown by objective neurological tests (EEG, VER, SSEP, EMG,
<br>
and the neurological exam).
<br>
<p>Working as a neurologist teaches you to be a skeptic. Even if your Bayesian
<br>
priors are skewed towards serious belief in supernaturalism, the daily
<br>
repetition of experiments giving results compatible with the opposite
<br>
attitude should lead you to snap out of it. 
<br>
<p>In the absence of a verifiable and unequivocal physical manifestation of a
<br>
God/ancestor spirit/time-travelling Mind, etc. I feel entirely justified in
<br>
interpreting reports of supernaturality as evidence of electrical
<br>
malfunctions.
