<p>Yes on both here too, and I'm a good subject since I tend to get sick as a
<br>
dog on long trips unless I'm flying the plane or driving the car.  Having
<br>
the shades down doesn't make me sicker, but facing backwards definitely
<br>
does. However, there are very effective motion sickness drugs, and the newer
<br>
ones don't cause drowsiness.
<br>
<p>Why would I not get sick if I'm driving the car or flying the plane? I
<br>
wonder if there's a theory on that. Looking straight ahead helps. I don't
<br>
get sick as easily riding as a passenger in the front seat as I do riding in
<br>
the back. But that's not the whole answer, because I do get sick sometimes
<br>
as a front seat passenger.
