<p>I would say they are trapped by both temperature and pressure.

See: &quot;Methane Explosion Warmed the Prehistoric Earth, Possible Again&quot;

<p>They think it may have been triggered by continental plate movement.
<br>
But once it gets started it may runaway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This uplift of tectonic plates would have decreased pressure in the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; atmosphere and oceans began to warm, Schmidt added, it is possible
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; current global heating could eventually lead to a similar scenario in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>So it would appear that glacier/ice cap accumulation lessening oceanic
<br>
pressure might not be the trigger, but reduced continental surface area
<br>
and/or warming from other sources may be sufficient.  An additional
<br>
possibility is changes in ocean currents causing warming of the ocean
<br>
bottom where hydrates have accumulated.
<br>
<p>In the previous case the warming was 7 deg. C.  That would result in
<br>
significant impact on humanity with quite possibly a large loss of life
<br>
due to weather pattern changes.  Not something one wants to invite
<br>
on oneself unless one is sure one understands the problem fully.
