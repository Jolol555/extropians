</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive that more databases will creep into the story over time, so this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the old database-independent-app problem.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a standard problem.  I've actually constructed fairly thorough
<br>
database abstraction layers (ANSI SQL only gets you so much), and there are
<br>
actually two primary problems in my experience:  SQL migration and schema
<br>
migration.
<br>
<p>The schema migration is the worse part, since you may find that there is no
<br>
equivalent form for your schema on a different database.  This is
<br>
particularly true if you start from relatively unrestricted databases (e.g.
<br>
DB2, Oracle) and move to a database that has dozens of seemingly innocuous
<br>
restrictions and limits (e.g. SQL Server 7) that are violated all over the
<br>
place with the original schema.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The big drama with retargetting the app is the mighty mountain of SQL which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is database specific. RDBMSs are supposed to follow standards with their SQL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - yeah, right. While they do look superficially similar, SQL dialects differ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fundamental join syntax, in built in functions, in the kinds of primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data types they provide operators for, etc. This can be a really big hassle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and from an ongoing maintenance point of view it is big enough to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project killer, especially if it forces a codebase to be forked into one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy for each database to be targetted.
</em><br>
<p><p>There isn't really a nice way to do this.  The last time I had to do this
<br>
(build an abstraction layer with support for every major RDBMS under the
<br>
sun), I built a Java abstraction framework for all database functionality
<br>
that was likely to be used by the application.  This was supported by a
<br>
plug-in cartridges that handled differences between our reference SQL (we
<br>
chose ANSI SQL99) and the individual database dialects.  The SQL conversion
<br>
was then done inside the API from SQL99 to the local dialect of the plug-in
<br>
cartridge.  This way, all the application code could be written to a single
<br>
ANSI SQL target.  Adding new plug-in cartridges turned out to be pretty
<br>
trivial once the first couple ones had been done, and this system worked
<br>
pretty nicely.  The APIs had support for many things beyond simple database
<br>
abstraction as well, such as caching and persistence, so it turned out to be
<br>
a good way to get all the  company applications off a particular database
<br>
and is used for just about everything these days.
<br>
<p>As I said, the biggest problem was migrating existing schema.  We started
<br>
with an Oracle 8i schema, which turned out to be a major problem when
<br>
migrating to feature restricted databases such as SQL Server 7.  In this
<br>
case there is no choice but to re-engineer the schema to the lowest common
<br>
denominator and/or move some database capabilities (e.g. sequence
<br>
generation) out of the DBMS into middleware.  We did the latter in some
<br>
cases and the former in others, depending on what the feature was that
<br>
wasn't portable.
<br>
<p>Good luck,
<br>
