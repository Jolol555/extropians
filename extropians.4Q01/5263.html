</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (po2) What magic turns an ordinary person into a trustworthy one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This ought to be an ExI FAQ. But it's going to need a pancritical, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a final, answer.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it is a FAQ - rather it is a FDA: a Frequently Desired
<br>
Answer. (Ouch, that is a horrible abbreviation :-) As you say, what we
<br>
need is to create a discourse that builds an answer.
<br>
<p>As for po2, I think I can at least throw out a first iteration: trust is
<br>
about long-term relations. As Axelrod suggested, you can build trust in
<br>
IPD-like situations since participants know they will be around each
<br>
other for a long time, and hence it is in their interests to cooperate.
<br>
I think it was Novak who later on did some game theory on how reputation
<br>
also helps: if your actions become known to others, then it pays to show
<br>
yourself trustworthy since other members in your community will take
<br>
your past actions into account even when they were aimed at somebody
<br>
else. So trust can be promoted by making past interactions clearer and
<br>
well known, and by the awareness of that there is a long future ahead. 
<br>
<p>We tend to trust a notarius publicus, lawyer or demolitions expert we
<br>
don't know because we know that there has been a certain selection
<br>
process underlying their achievement of that office, and that they would
<br>
be seriously penalized if they betrayed their trust. We trust them even
<br>
more when we know them (i.e. many interactions, and possibly a greater
<br>
investment in each other). The more ties and interactions we have with
<br>
each other, the easier we can build trust. Webs of trust and all that -
<br>
it doesn't matter that individual links are fallible if there are enough
<br>
of them to withstand the tensions caused by selfishness, parasites,
<br>
fundamentally incompatible goals and large risks/rewards. 
<br>
<p>The problem we face here is that we now have a far larger and diverse
<br>
society with larger tensions - suddenly everything is global, your
<br>
neighbour is a gay zoroastrian sociologist and the smallpox genome can
<br>
be found on the Internet. Solutions trying to fix things by making the
<br>
world a smaller place (isolationism) are practiclly unworkable (the
<br>
benefits are enormous), as are attempts to put genies back in bottles
<br>
(relinquishment). Attempts to make people less diverse are not just
<br>
ethically questionable and impractical, they also tend to breed
<br>
resistance that produces just the kind of nasty backlashes we have come
<br>
to fear. Hence any solution has to deal with strengthening those webs of
<br>
trust. 
<br>
<p>I think the NYT article makes a mistake by suggesting the choice is
<br>
between a less open society (artificial trust established by having a
<br>
special trusted part - the government - being given all the power), a
<br>
more controlled world (which seems to imply the same thing, but now on a
<br>
global scale) or higher risk. The naked airlines idea really shows a way
<br>
out: a bit of lateral thinking mixing a technical solution with a social
<br>
one. 
<br>
<p>If the west has exported hightech but not the social fabrics necessarily
<br>
to use it reasonably safely, we better find ways of packaging social
<br>
fabric with the hightech (maybe as packing material?). 
<br>
<p>As the cryptologists and cypherpunks have demonstrated trust is a hard
<br>
technological problem - but mainly if you try to solve it *only* through
<br>
some cryptographical protocol. What if we try to use tech to strengthen
<br>
those aspects of the social web of trust that can be technically
<br>
strengthened? Typical examples would be to improve memory and
<br>
reputation. Using the net it should be possible to make reputation
<br>
systems better and more accessible - we already have economic
<br>
reputations in the form of credit histories. The future-oriented side of
<br>
trust is less technical and more social: we need to ensure that others
<br>
have a stake in our future and vice versa. The interconnectedness of the
<br>
global economy is a good start. Borders where no merchants pass usually
<br>
have armies pass by soon. As somebody suggested here a few months ago,
<br>
give foreign aid in stocks to make other nations even more interested in
<br>
our wellfare. I am sure there are lots of great lateral thinking
<br>
technocultural solutions, everything from the smart contracts explained
<br>
by Mark Miller at E5 to better ways of embarrassing fundamentalists. 
<br>
<p>As I see it, the answer isn't the top-down *control* many people seem to
<br>
see as The Only Way (tm), but through adaptive and pervasive
<br>
*influence*. The more different groups influence each other, the less
<br>
incentive to strike against the other and the more incentive to work
<br>
together. It is the isolated groups that have nothing to lose that are
<br>
dangerous. 
<br>
<p>I don't claim this solves problems with truly devastating
<br>
one-mistake-blows-up-the-world technologies (my Eliezer simulation
<br>
subprocess has been going on throughout writing this essay about this;
<br>
but I leave that for another thread), but it certainly seems to be a
<br>
good start to deal with the here-and-now problems of both terrorism,
<br>
poverty, distrust etc. I also think we transhumanists with our somewhat
<br>
different perspective on human potential compared to the mainstream are
<br>
ideally suited for some truly lateral ideas of techno-cultural
<br>
innovations - which would be not just good for others, but for us as a
<br>
movement and as individuals capitalizing on these (hopefully) good
<br>
ideas. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Me? I'm probably too &quot;Neg&quot; at the moment to be on this list; I'm no Anders Sandberg; yet I still spend less time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explaining myself on this list than I'd have to in a corner bar. (&quot;Hier steh' ich--ich bin nicht Anders&quot;, to completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murder the Martin Luther quote and inject a few cc of humor)

<p>ROFL! Thanks, that joke really made my day. Maybe you should be Spike's
<br>
humor deputy? :-)
