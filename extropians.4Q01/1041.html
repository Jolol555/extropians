<p>I don't dispute any of the preceeding statements you make.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Fact. Bin Laden has sworn on the Koran that he didn't
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Can you furnish a reference on this one? Not being snippy, I really do
<br>
want to read the original quote.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Opinion. I have no idea whether Mossad or any other
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Me neither.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; absolutely no illusions that Mossad or the Israeli
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government is incapable of performing such actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should they feel them to be &quot;neccessary&quot;. I am especially
</em><br>
<p>Nor do I, nor do most people including Israelis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; taken with the fact that there is a logical fallacy based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on motivation for the Bin Laden hypothesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Supposition. Bin Laden is a fanatical partisan of Islam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He performs these many monstrous evil deeds because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of his &quot;faith&quot;. This is his presumed motivation for 9-11.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   However. Bin Laden is reported (by the former Pakistani
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Minister of Defense, himself a devout Muslim) to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sworn to his old friend on his Holy Koran that he was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for 9-11.
</em><br>
<p>This is second hand information. The minister himself did
<br>
not swear on the Koran, merely said that Bin Target did.
<br>
Furthermore, as you point out he is a friend and a fellow
<br>
devout Muslim, therefore not an impartial witness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   So is he devout enough to blow us up, but apostate enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to swear before his God that he didn't do it?
</em><br>
<p>Are Muslims even allowed to invoke Allah or the Koran when
<br>
they swear something is true? Anybody know? Besides, if
<br>
he didn't do it, why not repeat the statement on tape, so
<br>
the US would either have to stop bombing the Taliban and
<br>
look stupid or lose the support of all its allies for
<br>
continuing to bomb an 'innocent' Islamofascist state?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   This is not the proper pattern. We should be open to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternate explanations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Opinion. Taliban is evil. Bin Laden is evil. Israel is evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (insofar as &quot;evil&quot; is a word with meaning). A plague on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both their houses. Let the Arabs slaughter the Jews,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drill Alaska full of holes, and sell OUR oil to Japan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Europe and let the Muslim world find it's own way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Alex, please feel free to support your offhand characterization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Mossad theory as &quot;insane&quot;... but as always..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be prepared to get clubbed with the big stick of truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case it's a really BIG stick.
</em><br>
<p>Fine, I'll upgrade it to 'extremely unlikely'. For reference, I
<br>
believe that Mossad wiretapping of Whitehouse phones and attempting to
<br>
blackmail Clinton during the peace talks (which fell through and
<br>
resulted in the Lewinski scandal) to be in the general vicinity of
<br>
'plausible'.
<br>
<p>The reason I think Mossad direct involvement in this incident is
<br>
unlikely is because:
<br>
<p>1. The cell phone conversations from flight 93 were quoted in the news
<br>
as describing the hijackers as Middle-Eastern looking. Granted, the
<br>
original conversations now only exist in the memories of the family
<br>
members.
<br>
<p>2. I don't see why a mercenary would go on a suicide
<br>
mission. Therefore, if the Mossad was behind this, all the hijackers
<br>
would have to be Israeli patriots. Granted, it's not impossible for a
<br>
Sephardic Jew to pass for an Arab. Granted also, fake paper trails
<br>
pointing to Muslim countries could be constructed.
<br>
<p>3. Bin Loser advised his lieutenants to return to 'home base', shortly
<br>
before the attack according to a statement by Tony Blair. Granted,
<br>
Blair is not necessarily an impartial source of information.
<br>
<p>If you say that Mossad knew about the plot and didn't tell us, I'll
<br>
consider that plausible. If you say that Mossad materially helped out
<br>
the perpetrators, I'll consider that plausible. But actually do this
<br>
particular deed? No.
<br>
<p>If Bin Flattened's denial of responsibility for the bombing is
<br>
confirmed (and he doesn't have to swear on the Koran-- the word of
<br>
somebody with so little to gain by lying serves just fine) is
<br>
confirmed by video tape or numerous and disinterested witnesses, my
<br>
next guess is some other Islamic fundie group or Iraq. Even so, if
<br>
what we think we know about Al Qeda is true, they are certain to have
<br>
served at least as an enabler for whomever it was that did this.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I also agree with Colin Powell-- whether Bin Satan did this
<br>
one or not, we should still take him out for the things he does own up
<br>
to doing, and for being a dangerous, power-hungry demagogue who just
<br>
might succeed at his goal otherwise.
<br>
<p>PS: His goal? Nevermind Israel, Palestine, and the 'plundering of
<br>
Arabia by the Great Satan'. The cavemen are just as spin-savvy as us
<br>
imperialists. The real target is Pakistan. If he can get the
<br>
Pakistanis riled up to the point where they overthrow Mussharaff, it
<br>
may become the first Shariya state to posess a nuclear bomb. The tide
<br>
of hype issuing from such a coup could probably sweep several other
<br>
nations over the edge. Maybe Egypt. Maybe Saudi Arabia, which would
<br>
give him oil in addition to the bomb, and kick the legs out from under
<br>
our [crude] efforts to contain Iraq [that we turned into our enemy in
<br>
the first place for reasons that still make no sense to me].
<br>
<p>- -- 
<br>
* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
<br>
* honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
<br>
