<p>It isn't as simple as that.  First giving everybody tests as to whether
<br>
they are allergic isn't going to be cheap.  Even at $10/test that looks
<br>
to be ~$3 billion.  I suspect the cost would be more like $50-100.
<br>
Secondly, testing for allergies isn't foolproof.  Some people may
<br>
still have negative reactions to being vaccinated.  Because everyone
<br>
has their own MHC allele combination (6 genes with perhaps several
<br>
hundred varients per gene) and probably additional polymorphisms
<br>
in the several hundred cytokine signaling molecules and their
<br>
receptors immune response to various substances is highly
<br>
unpredictable.
<br>
<p>It probably would be worth allowing adults who want to accept the
<br>
risks to be vaccinated at their own cost (after having demonstrated
<br>
that they are aware of the risks).  The government should also
<br>
consider offering free vaccinations to any essential people,
<br>
particularly those in medical fields.  That way at least they
<br>
don't become infected and become the &quot;Typhoid Marys&quot; of an
<br>
outbreak.
