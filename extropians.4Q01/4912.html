</em><br>
<p><p>Adrafinil is the only other drug in the same class as Modafinil (&quot;eugorics&quot;
<br>
I believe), and was actually a primitive version of Modafinil.  Adrafinil
<br>
was cheap, but showed substantial liver toxicity and was poorly targeted in
<br>
the brain.  Modafinil refined the initial breakthrough that was Adrafinil,
<br>
eliminating many of the undesirable side effects and more narrowly targeting
<br>
the desired effect.
<br>
<p>I believe these are both readily available in many parts of Europe, though I
<br>
could be mistaken.  They ARE scheduled in the U.S., so possession without a
<br>
rather narrow prescription is a crime.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In addition to its wakefulness-promoting effects and increased locomotor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; activity in animals, in humans, PROVIGIL produces psychoactive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, and thinking, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; feelings typical of other CNS stimulants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless Modafinil is much more effective than Adrafinil, this seems unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me.
</em><br>
<p><p>One of the hallmarks of eugorics is that the effect is largely unnoticeable.
<br>
This has made them unpopular in the recreational drug world.  Several
<br>
western militaries have adopted modafinil, citing very good real world
<br>
performance and a lot of evidence suggesting far fewer long-term
<br>
consequences (e.g. brain damage) than the amphetamine type drugs previously
<br>
used.  The basic operational subtlety from a military standpoint is that
<br>
amphetamines prevent sleep, whereas eugorics eliminate the need to sleep.
<br>
As I recall, one of the features that the military liked with modafinil was
<br>
that most people on it had the ability to sleep at will regardless of where
<br>
they were in their dosing cycle.  This greatly aided in the use of unnatural
<br>
and irregular sleep schedules without significant reductions in performance.
<br>
<p>This is all from memory, though, so I could be mistaken.
