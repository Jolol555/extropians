</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions of this possibility that would be very good). (Or both the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preceding are true.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a strong convergence thesis is true, such that any posthuman 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization will almost certainly develop in a direction 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think I see my mistake...
<br>
<p>Where you say this:
<br>
<p>&quot;We can, however, conclude that one naïve transhumanist dogma is false.: The
<br>
probability that you or your descendants will ever run an
<br>
ancestor-simulation is negligible, unless you are now living in such a
<br>
simulation.&quot;
<br>
<p>I took it to mean that the statement
<br>
<p>&quot;The probability that you or your descendants will ever run an
<br>
ancestor-simulation is negligible, unless you are now living in such a
<br>
simulation.&quot;
<br>
<p>was concluded by you to be false.
<br>
<p>Obviously this seemed strange, seeing that you had gone to some pains to
<br>
show it to be true.
<br>
<p>I imagine that you mean the following:
<br>
<p>We can, however, conclude that one naïve transhumanist dogma (that humanity
<br>
will achieve a post-human status and run ancestor simulations) is false,
<br>
unless we are now living in such a simulation.
<br>
<p>Does that make sense?
<br>
<p><p>-----
<br>
<p><p>Oh, and by the way, no I didn't think I was running in a sim, until recently
<br>
maybe. I came across this argument about nested simulations recently (or
<br>
fully digested it, anyway), and it's intrigued me, I must admit... possibly
<br>
the best argument for the existence of &quot;god&quot; (in the broadest possible
<br>
sense) that I've ever come across. That's not fun given that I am an atheist
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p>One piece of the argument which troubles me is this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Since the experiences that an observer has if she is living in a simulation
<br>
are indistinguishable from those she has if she is living in unmediated
<br>
physical reality, it follows from a very weak form of the principle of
<br>
indifference that the probability of her living in a simulation equals the
<br>
fraction of observers that live in simulations[5]. &quot;
<br>
<p>This seems to take it for granted that an entity living in the &quot;real world&quot;
<br>
(at the root) and an entity living inside any level of sim are equivalent in
<br>
terms of what I might call &quot;being&quot;, for wont of a better term. ie: there is
<br>
no significant difference between a simulated being and an actual being.
<br>
<p>While this may be the case, it does assume a strong materialist view of
<br>
consciousness. This must be the case for the principle of indifference to
<br>
apply. That's probably ok, but maybe it needs to be stated explicitly? (Note
<br>
that I'm not trying to get into a consciousness debate here.)
<br>
<p>A couple of other points:
<br>
<p>&quot;Reality may thus contain many levels. Even if it is necessary for the
<br>
hierarchy to bottom out at some stage - the metaphysical status of this
<br>
claim is somewhat obscure - there may be room for a large number of levels
<br>
of reality, and the number could be increasing over time. &quot;
<br>
<p>Speaking about change over time in the overall hierarchy of simulations is a
<br>
bit dangerous. While it might be true that there is a loose &quot;arrow of time&quot;
<br>
across the whole set of simulations/universes (simuverses?), with the
<br>
hierarchy defining dependencies, it is still the case that time, as part of
<br>
the notion of space/time, is local to each given simulation... if it is
<br>
sensibly defined in all. To give a very basic example, it is entirely
<br>
possible that a given sim might be run backwards, if the universes' creators
<br>
had reversed the physical laws, such that the local experience of time in
<br>
the inner sim was reversed when compared to the outer sim.
<br>
<p>I would have thought that, if you are arguing that the probability that we
<br>
are in a sim approximates 1, you are likewise arguing that the number of
<br>
sims approximates infinity (or some slightly more sensible statement), and
<br>
does so right now (in whatever reference you draw &quot;now&quot; from). 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;(One consideration that counts against the multi-level hypothesis is that
<br>
the computational costs for the basement-level simulators would be very
<br>
great. Simulating even a single posthuman civilization might be too
<br>
expensive. If so, then we should expect our simulation to be terminated when
<br>
we are about to reach the posthuman stage.)&quot;
<br>
<p>This makes major assumptions about the physics of computation outside of our
<br>
universe, which are entirely ungrounded in my opinion. It may be that it is
<br>
more common for infinite computing capacity to be possible in sims than not.
<br>
Alternatively, it does not take into account the possibility that the sim
<br>
would be rigged to slow down, relative to the outer sim, to make up for lack
<br>
of concurrent execution resources. As the relative time frames became
<br>
infinitely divergent (the inner sim approaching stasis with respect to the
<br>
outer sim), the inner sim would approach infinite computational ability
<br>
*with respect to its own time frame&quot;.
