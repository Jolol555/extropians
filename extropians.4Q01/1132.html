<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;As an immigrant I represent a clear gain for the American society. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;with excellent education (worth about 300 000$, counting the investment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;my childhood, grade school, high school, medical school, postgraduate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;education, entirely paid by the taxpayers in Poland and Germany), good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;health, decent work ethic. By competing with local physicians, I and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;IMG's (International Medical Graduates) contributed to the reduction in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;healthcare cost growth rate that occurred in the last few years, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;maintaining a consistent standard of quality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have stated many, many times, that I think that ANYONE and EVERYONE 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legitimate MD shoukd be able to come here to the USA. In fact, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggested PAYING them large sums of money to come here. I have suggested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; building medical schools in 3rd worlds so we can get MORE M.D.s here. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same thing goes for PhD's or even for *legitimate* students who want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; study for a PhD here, and already have a *good* degree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are wrong about immigrants in general being a plus for America, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me. You are not the general case. Not only are there many studies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;showing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just that, but common *emotionally detached* sense will tell you the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;snip another offensive comment...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While Randy is correct that immigrants in general (legal and illegal)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not being a plus for America, LEGAL immigrants regularly show that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are significant plusses, and those demonizers here should not try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;construe my (or Randy's ) opinions to be blindly anti-foreigner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Immigration controls, properly written and administered, are significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contributors to the trust bank which needs to build up for a free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society to function well. They should NOT discriminate blindly against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people by their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, etc., but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly SHOULD have significant merit based filters built in, as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as controls that help assure the citizenry that those who are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;admitted are contributors and worthy of trust as a citizen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We are in the situation we are in today specifically because we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;torn down many of the most useful barriers to entry while keeping many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the most inequitable barriers, and have eliminated ANY means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keeping track of those let in on a temporary basis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am all for unlimited immigration, but only between high trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;societies. We should not automatically treat all foreigners as if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;live in high trust societies. They don't, generally, and 9-11 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;partially the result of such bad judgement (along with a refusal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trust citizens with all of their rights when on an airliner).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NOTE to Randy: Cut the offensive comments, they make you look worse than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you are.
</em><br>
<p>Ha! what about THEIR offensive comments?! Shall I enumerate?
