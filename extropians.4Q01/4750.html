<p>Based on and requiring what level of evidence and proof though?

Surely not simply accusation or suspicion of &quot;knowing

something&quot;. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; They made our country a

</em><br>
<p>Careful.  Which &quot;they&quot;?  Not all the people round up and held
<br>
for sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because our entire country is now a combat zone, they must live with the

<p>Again, which &quot;they&quot;.

<p><em>&gt; blend into the law abiding muslim population, they make all muslims

<br>
<p><em>&gt; incredibly remarkable sensitivity and restraint in the small number of

<em>&gt; literally, DO, in fact, permit us to detain all individuals in the

</em><br>
<p>What country precisely attacked us?  It was a terrorist attack.

<p><em>&gt;

<p>I would rather make a fool of myself for respecting human rights

than make a fool of myself insisting on the letter of the law

and calling others fools if they insist on any more than that.
