<p>LIFE EXTENSION WEEKLY UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Vitamin C helps in congestive heart failure
<br>
<p>Congestive heart failure patients experience dysfunction of the blood
<br>
vessels' endothelium leading to a restriction of  blood supply to the body,
<br>
associated with weakening of the heart muscle.  This endothelial dysfunction
<br>
is caused by programmed cell death, or apoptosis, resulting from systemic
<br>
inflammation and an increase in oxidative stress.  In a study published in
<br>
the October 30 2001 issue of of Circulation: Journal of the American Heart
<br>
Association, European researchers established a benefit of vitamin C in
<br>
suppressing the signal for cell death within the inner lining, or
<br>
endothelium, of blood vessels in congestive heart failure patients.
<br>
<p>In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, thirty-four patients with
<br>
congestive heart failure were randomized to receive infusions of either 2.5
<br>
grams vitamin C or a placebo.  Baseline blood samples were drawn prior to
<br>
and 15 minutes after the infusion.  This was followed by a regimen of oral
<br>
vitamin C or a placebo twice per day for three days.  Blood samples were
<br>
taken on the fifth day and plasma levels of apoptotic microparticles were
<br>
measured to determine the level of apoptosis.
<br>
<p>Study participants were found to have apoptotic particles that were 32% of
<br>
baseline levels, while those receiving a placebo experienced no change.
<br>
Study coauthor Stefanie Dimmeler, Ph.D., a professor at the University of
<br>
Frankfurt in Germany commented, &quot;Increasing evidence suggests that oxidative
<br>
stress regulates apoptosis of endothethial cells. Therefore, we questioned
<br>
whether antioxidatant treatment with vitamin C could reduce endothelial cell
<br>
death in CHF patients.  This study, for the first time, proves the relevance
<br>
of these findings by demonstrating that antioxidant treatment inhibits
<br>
apoptosis of endothelial cells in patients with CHF.  The findings might
<br>
contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of heart failure
<br>
progression and could add antioxidant treatment as a novel strategy to delay
<br>
progression of heart failure.&quot;
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Congestive heart failure
<br>
<p>Congestive heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood
<br>
throughout the body (but not all patients with heart failure have
<br>
congestion). There are two categories of congestive heart failure: systolic
<br>
and diastolic. In the systolic type of the disease, blood coming into the
<br>
heart from the lungs may be regurgitated so that fluid accumulates in the
<br>
lungs (pulmonary congestion). In the diastolic type, the heart muscle
<br>
becomes stiff and cannot relax, leading to an accumulation of fluid in the
<br>
feet, ankles, legs, and abdomen.
<br>
<p>Congestive heart failure is in itself not a diagnosis. Rather it is the
<br>
physiological result of damage to the heart caused by some underlying
<br>
condition. Therefore, it is not enough to say that a person has congestive
<br>
heart failure. The CHF has to be due to some underlying process, and that
<br>
diagnosis is important in terms of treatment and prognosis.
<br>
<p>The most common underlying cause for congestive heart failure is
<br>
hypertension (high blood pressure). The Framingham Heart Study recently
<br>
reported that high blood pressure increased the risk of developing heart
<br>
failure about 2 times for men and 3 times for women. A second important risk
<br>
factor for the disease is diabetes mellitus. The incidence of heart failure
<br>
among diabetics is three to eight times greater than in the normal
<br>
population. Other forms of cardiac disease, such as myocardial infarction,
<br>
valve disease, rheumatic heart disease, and certain types of congenital
<br>
conditions, also increase the potential for developing heart failure.
<br>
Secondary risk factors include smoking, obesity, and high cholesterol.
<br>
<p>Recent studies indicate that coenzyme Q10, human growth hormone, taurine,
<br>
magnesium, and L-carnitine can be of substantial benefit in the treatment of
<br>
CHF and IDC (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy) when used as adjunctive
<br>
therapies. Chelation therapy may be beneficial. Patients who do not respond
<br>
well to medication may benefit from other types of therapy such as LVAD
<br>
devices and mitral valve surgery. Organ transplantation may be the last
<br>
option for a number of patients with CHF or cardiomyopathy. Prior to
<br>
considering any adjunctive therapy, consult with your cardiologist. Here is
<br>
a review of the treatment options:
<br>
<p>1.  Coenzyme Q10 has proven to be an effective treatment for patients with
<br>
CHF and cardiomyopathy by improving cardiac workload and contractility of
<br>
the heart muscle and increasing exercise tolerance. The recommended dosage
<br>
of coenzyme Q10 is 100 mg, 3 times daily.
<br>
<p>2.  Carnitine has been shown to benefit patients with IDC (particularly
<br>
children) by increasing left ventricular function. The recommended dose is
<br>
2000 mg a day.
<br>
<p>3.  Taurine, when used in combination with other therapies, may benefit CHF
<br>
patients. The daily dosage of taurine is 2000 mg.
<br>
<p>4.  Growth hormone, when used in conjunction with conventional medications,
<br>
was proven to increase cardiac output, particularly left ventricular
<br>
function. The recommended dosage for growth hormone is 1 to 2 IU daily, or
<br>
as recommended by a cardiologist.
<br>
<p>5.  In lieu of growth hormone, arginine may provide the same benefits. Daily
<br>
dosage of arginine is 6 to 10 grams.
<br>
<p>6.  When used in conjunction with other therapies, magnesium can improve
<br>
cardiac hemodynamics and reduce the risk of arrhythmia in patients with CHF.
<br>
The daily dose of magnesium is 1000 mg. Patients may want to consider taking
<br>
magnesium-rich Life Extension Mix. The recommended dose is 3 tablets, 3
<br>
times daily.
<br>
<p>7. Fish oil may increase cardiac output and reduce the risk of arrhythmia.
<br>
The recommended dosage is 5 to 8 capsules a day containing at least 400 mg
<br>
of EPA and 300 mg of DHA.

<p>FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Arginine capsules 900 milligrams
<br>
<p>L-arginine is an essential amino acid. L-ornithine may be used as an
<br>
alternative since it metabolizes to L-arginine in the body. If taken in
<br>
doses larger that those normally obtained from your diet or if taken on an
<br>
empty stomach, these amino acids may be helpful for:
<br>
<p>Hypertension:   L-arginine is required for the body to synthesize nitric
<br>
oxide, which enables the arterial system to retain its youthful elasticity,
<br>
thus alleviating hypertension in some people. Nitric oxide also helps to
<br>
produce endothelial relaxation factor, which is needed by the arterial
<br>
system to expand and contract with each heartbeat. The inability of arteries
<br>
to expand and contract is a major cause of hypertension associated with
<br>
aging. If you decide to try L-arginine to lower blood pressure, ask your
<br>
physician to reduce your antihypertensive medication while you are
<br>
increasing your intake of arginine. The suggested dose of L-arginine as a
<br>
blood pressure lowering agent is 4500 mg three times daily. For some people,
<br>
L-arginine does not lower blood pressure, so it's crucial that your blood
<br>
pressure be monitored to ensure that it is under control. L-ornithine is not
<br>
a suitable alternative for this purpose since quick synthesis of nitric
<br>
oxide is required.
<br>
<p>Growth hormone:  L-arginine and L-ornithine have been shown to promote
<br>
natural growth hormone (GH) release from the pituitary gland. GH promotes
<br>
healthy anabolic metabolism throughout the body, helping to maintain
<br>
youthful protein synthesis within cells. Aging causes a decline in protein
<br>
synthesis that results in many of the degenerative diseases of aging, which
<br>
may be partially corrected by enhancing GH serum levels. You can measure the
<br>
GH enhancing effects of L-arginine/L-ornithine by measuring your blood
<br>
levels of somatomedin C (IGF-1), a GH metabolite.

<p>Taurine capsules
<br>
<p>Taurine is a conditionally essential amino acid produced from cysteine by
<br>
the body and found abundantly in the body, particularly throughout the
<br>
excitable tissues of the central nervous system, where it is thought to have
<br>
a regulating influence. However, taurine is deficient in many diets and may
<br>
not be sufficiently produced by the body in certain disease states.
<br>
<p>Taurine has been reported to:
<br>
<p>Prevent cataracts
<br>
<p>Boost cardiac output in those suffering from congestive heart failure or
<br>
cardiomyopathy
<br>
<p>Be frequently deficient in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy
<br>
<p>Control epileptic seizures, uncontrollable facial twitches, and motor tics
