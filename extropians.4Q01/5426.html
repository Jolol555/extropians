<p><p>There is an interesting story about a court case involving the definition of
<br>
possession of a weapon that could &quot;easily be converted to a machinegun&quot;.  A
<br>
man in possession of a nominally legal firearm was charged with possession
<br>
of an illegal machinegun, not because the firearm WAS a machinegun but
<br>
because it COULD be made into a machinegun by a sufficiently knowledgeable
<br>
machinist.  (A famously typical response by the ATF; when an investigation
<br>
turns up no obvious wrongdoing, charge the individual with an implausible
<br>
stretch of a regulatory definition and see what sticks.)
<br>
<p>The regulatory definition provided by the BATF was that a &quot;machinegun&quot; was
<br>
any device, not necessarily an operating firearm, that could be turned into
<br>
an operating machinegun by a competent machinist in no more than 8 hours,
<br>
the definition used by the prosecutor.  To demonstrate the absurdity of such
<br>
a definition (which was regulatory, not statutory), the defense hired a
<br>
machinist with the proper licensing to manufacture a functioning machinegun
<br>
using nothing but an old car that they had retrieved from a junk yard.  The
<br>
machinist was able to manufacture and test fire a machinegun (of very
<br>
dubious quality) from the car carcass in less than 8 hours.  The judge
<br>
agreed that the BATF definition was ridiculous, as the defense had
<br>
demonstrated that everyone who owned a car could be legitimately indicted
<br>
under it.  I don't recall the final outcome of the case, though the ATF was
<br>
forced to use a much more rigorous regulatory definition of machinegun.
<br>
<p>I don't really have a point to this story, other than to illustrate that
<br>
with 21st century manufacturing technology, there is absolutely nothing you
<br>
could do to prevent anyone with even the slightest inclination or profit
<br>
motive from manufacturing 19th century weapon designs.  The exponential
<br>
take-off in technology applies to fabrication as well as silicon.  For very
<br>
little money today, a person can buy tooling that is more sophisticated and
<br>
capable than that which produced most of the weapons in use in the world
<br>
today.  We don't have to wait for garage nanotech to happen before we'll be
<br>
facing this issue.
