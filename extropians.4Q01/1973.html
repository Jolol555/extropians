<em>&gt; &gt; Samantha has the childish idea that the man on the street is basically

<em>&gt; wise and

<em>&gt; &gt; trustworthy so if something is a democracy it must be a good thing and we

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The point is that it was not our country to meddle around in and
<br>
we had no legitimate reason for such meddling.  We have
<br>
performed assasinations, raised up insurgents, destablized
<br>
economies, supported puppet regimes and so on too many times and
<br>
in too many places.  Some of those countries were not remotely
<br>
that bad by our own lights.  In some cases the democratically
<br>
elected leader was pro-progress, pro-free trade and just left
<br>
leaning enough to have a welfare state not much different than
<br>
our own.  Yet if the leader was to independent to play along
<br>
with some of our interests he was still ousted, sometimes at
<br>
horrible cost to the people of the country.  
<br>
<p>Is it childish to expect us to leave up to the ideals we
<br>
expouse?  Is it childish to expect us to refrain from molding
<br>
the government of other countries to our liking by violent,
<br>
illegal and yes, terrorist, means?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Not being a supporter of democracy myself, I don't see the point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting oligarchies or military dictatorships either.  Again, the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government should just disengage...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, I don't want a democracy in Egypt or Saudi Arabia or Pakistan and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps not even in Iraq because however unsavory the dictators of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are in a free election they would be replaced by something far worse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious zealots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aiming at martyrdom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The regimes in Egypt and Saudi Arabia helped to make al Qaeda possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of its members and its leadership are from -- you guessed it! -- these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two countries.  In fact, one of the best kept secrets -- from the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people -- is that Egypt creates some of the most militant terrorists in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The Saudi government is massively corrupt.  Billions are
<br>
funneled straight into the account of members of its royalty. 
<br>
Even its great wealth has now hemorraghed away as far as the
<br>
average citizen is concerned.  On one hand they have play the
<br>
protector of the faith.  On the other hand they have played at
<br>
being very business-wise and open with and mostly supportive of
<br>
the west.  They are quite schitzy now and tettering dangerously. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Also, the Pakistani government -- of course, after the coup it's much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same -- helped to put and keep the Taleban in power!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The pattern has been repeated.  If you ignore Jimm Carter's cry not to look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at &quot;ancient history&quot; -- in other words the 25 years before the Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Revolution of '79 -- you'll see that the US support of the Shah of Iran
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helped him to [unwittingly] radicalize the Muslim population there.  Surely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither the Shah nor his US supporters intended this, but his repressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies basically destroyed the Iranian middle class and what hope there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was from the 1950s to 1979 for a secular, open society.  (Today, Iran is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting to move back in that direction.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually the Shah started getting too independent for our liking
<br>
so we helped support the fundamentalist and other uprisings and
<br>
protests against him.  When this proved a really bad idea we
<br>
supported Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war.  When that proved a bad
<br>
idea we ultimately got Desert Storm.  On and on it goes, where
<br>
it ends...?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; do you think the CIA was prohibited from being in the assasination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; in 1981 for no reason at all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Fortunately it looks like the CIA will soon get back into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assassination business,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we all know who number one on the target list will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it's about time!  Once such assassinations begin, hopefully, war will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn into leaders being killed -- as opposed to civilians or drafted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldiers.  If war returns to being a specialized affair of the elites, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the masses will, hopefully, turn away from it and we can approximate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopefully improve on the the pre-Napoleonic view of war as just the affair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of kings -- and not of whole societies against one another.
</em><br>
<p>Once assasination starts it will not be restricted to nations we
<br>
are at war with.  It will be used wherever it seems convenient
<br>
for any of our interests.  Nor will it necessarily only be done
<br>
in foreign countries.  Talk about a cowardly act.
