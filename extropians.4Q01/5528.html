KPJ, I think you misunderstand.
<br>
<p>Assessing someone as &quot;too irrational to be trusted&quot; does not necessarily
<br>
imply that the assessment is objective, nor that it will be acted upon by
<br>
a government agent or agency. 
<br>
<p>Compare that phrase with &quot;this ice cream is too cold to eat&quot;, and you might
<br>
see that point better.
<br>
<p>Please re-read the quoted part in that light.
<br>
<p>She is saying that governments should NOT be trusted more than people.
