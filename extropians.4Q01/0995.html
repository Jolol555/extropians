<p>I haven't researched the sources thoroughly, but I don't think
<br>
they would come up with numbers that accurate without it being
<br>
fairly reliable information.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So where exactly is the huge worry comming out of Iraq?
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say that there was -- I was simply using those
<br>
numbers of examples of how dangerous things could get
<br>
if any number of Islamic states decided that they wanted
<br>
to make &quot;war&quot; on the U.S.
<br>
<p>The Russian stockpiles are *much* larger than Iraqs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if, and it is a big IF, he is desperate enough to use these

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hmmm....  As I recall during the Gulf war most of the weapons
<br>
the Iraqis had were Soviet.
<br>
<p>This article is on &quot;Saddam Hussein - his rise to power&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/events/crisis_in_the_gulf/decision_makers_and_diplomacy/newsid_216000/216328.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/events/crisis_in_the_gulf/decision_makers_and_diplomacy/newsid_216000/216328.stm</a>
<br>
<p>It does not seem to suggest that the U.S. played any important
<br>
role in creating him.  He looks entirely like a self-made man
<br>
to me.  If you can find some legitimate data that confirms
<br>
something like &quot;U.S. foreign aid dollars were used to purchase
<br>
weapons used against the Iranians or the Kuwaitis&quot; I'll be
<br>
happy to look at it but the article suggests that he was
<br>
anti-British and anti-West from the start.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is true. But the best way to avoid dying in a war is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get into one. The second best way is not to prolong one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unnecessarily or push more and more people into the enemy camp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and increasingly inflame them. 
</em><br>
<p>We are in a war and we didn't start it.  If you have listened to
<br>
bin Laden's statements he is stating plainly and clearly that
<br>
he intends to keep attacking until the U.S. pulls every single
<br>
U.S. military individual out of Saudi Arabia.  He will presumably
<br>
then turn his terrorists on the Saudi Royal family.  If that succeeds
<br>
he will then return to Saudi Arabia and likely become Saddam II.
<br>
Now during all of that oil prices will go through the roof.
<br>
If bin Laden becomes the Saddam of Saudi Arabia he could quite
<br>
well cut off oil entirely.  Do you *remember* the oil embargos?
<br>
I do.  That is why we got into the Persian Gulf War a decade ago.
<br>
<p>Now, would you like to make the tradeoff between the number of
<br>
lives lost due to a failure to be able to pay heating bills
<br>
vs. the number that will be lost in an effort to capture this
<br>
guy and bring him to justice?
<br>
<p>Just to keep in mind in the Gulf War, up against hundreds of
<br>
thousands of troops much better armed than an estimated 30,000
<br>
Taliban troops:
<br>
<em>&gt; The United States suffered 148 killed in action, 458 wounded,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 121 killed in nonhostile actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from: <a href="http://www.netwiz.net/~cryan/war.html">http://www.netwiz.net/~cryan/war.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>bin Laden &amp; associates has already killed more than 30 times
<br>
as many of our citizens.
<br>
<p>I'm not a war monger.  I *am* a pragmatist.  If you have a
<br>
solution that would not require going after bin Laden I
<br>
would be happy to listen to it.
<br>
