<p>Okay. Since we have a hierarchical government, borders are something
<br>
we'll have to put up with. For now. But as society moves away from
<br>
hierarchical control, we'll become as much of an indistinct target as
<br>
Al Pisda now is. Acts of massive destruction will still be possible,
<br>
but they will be robbed of their symbolism, their political leverage.

<p>Okay. The second rule of winning at iterated prisoner's dilemma is
<br>
tit-for-tat after all. Just let's remember that the third rule is to
<br>
periodically re-evaluate the untrustworthy agent's behavior to make
<br>
sure they are still an untrustworthy agent.

</em><br>
<p>No, keep it up, Randy. You have no idea how bored I've gotten with
<br>
nobody but liberals to skewer. The few conservatives on this list are
<br>
so low-key and reasonable-sounding I can barely tell them apart from
<br>
libertarians. Variety! I crave variety.
