<em>&gt; Sincerely, I hate to bring this subject up again, but it has been running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through my mind.  It seems a good number of the people on this list
</em><br>
support
<br>
<em>&gt; the assertion that a copy is 'you'. 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I am not sure I consider the question all that relevant.  Increasing the
<br>
number of intelligent beings or moving such intelligence around in time or
<br>
space seems like generally a good thing to me whether or not I consider a
<br>
&quot;copy&quot; to be &quot;me&quot;.  And it seems a generally good thing if a being very much
<br>
like &quot;me&quot; is around for longer than this body might hold up. &quot;
<br>
<p>I consider it very relevant if the question is regarding my continued
<br>
existence.  I ask you the same question that I asked in response to another
<br>
message, if you could have a magical guarantee of subjective immortality,
<br>
would you prefer that over merely being copied?  One option guarantees
<br>
subjective immortality, the other only hopes it still occurs.  Well, since
<br>
we can not magically guarantee subjective immortality, it would be
<br>
reasonable to approach the question as conservatively and as cautiously as
<br>
possible.  We need not discuss any metaphsyical 'souls' or resort to
<br>
philosophical musings, we know that a human brain houses a concioussness,
<br>
therefore do as much as we can to make your brain immortal without a
<br>
destructive copying and you have subjective immortatily.  I am sure you, as
<br>
most people, would prefer copying over *nothing* but would you not prefer
<br>
subjective immortatility over copying?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was wondering if, perhaps, someone can enlighten me on the fallacies of
</em><br>
my
<br>
<em>&gt; argument.  It is vitally important for me that I feel comfortable in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner in which I may end up surviving bodily death and that hopefully it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will indeed be 'me' and not a copy of me.  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I think you will have the devil's own job attempting to come up with a
<br>
reasonably tight and useful definition of just what
<br>
constitutes &quot;you&quot;.  It might be that the worry is unimportant because what
<br>
you consider &quot;you&quot; is not of as much substance as
<br>
you believe it to be. &quot;
<br>
<p>I dont think it is neccesary to even define 'me' or 'you'  All we need to do
<br>
is perform a simple scientific test, Copy you without destroying the
<br>
original.  Wake them both up, take one of you into another room, and ask the
<br>
other you if they can percieve what the other you percieves.  If not, then
<br>
you are subjectively isolated and a copy would not constitute subjective
<br>
immortality.  NO definition of 'you' or 'me' need be agreed upon.  
<br>
<p>In my opinion, though, an objective definition of me would merely be my
<br>
neural pattern, but a subjective definition of me would be my neural pattern
<br>
and the material that makes up that pattern, as the above thought
<br>
experiement demonstrates, copying the pattern to a new medium will not
<br>
result in a subjective continuity.  
<br>
<p>&quot;There are two main possible positions that I see:
<br>
a) there is some extra something that makes you &quot;you&quot; that does
<br>
not get copied and/or transferred in copying;
<br>
b) there is no such extra something.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;So your position seems to require some variant of (a).  Is that correct?
<br>
Definitely if we assume the copy is deep enough then
<br>
the copy will experience itself just as if it was &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;You&quot; awakening in
<br>
the copy would not consider yourself to not have
<br>
been at all any more than you consider yourself to not have been when you
<br>
wake up from sleep or anathesia.  &quot;
<br>
<p>No, my position does not require the existence of some supernatural source
<br>
of 'me'.  As the thought expirement I laid out demonstrates, if the copy and
<br>
the original have isolated subjective experiences, then killing the original
<br>
is not conducive to subjective continuity.
