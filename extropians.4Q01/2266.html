From: &quot;Lee Daniel Crocker&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=Re:%20Non-sensory%20experiences&In-Reply-To=&lt;052601c167ae$377a0ac0$0a5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">lee@piclab.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Haven't you ever had the experience of not being able to find the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words to describe an idea?
</em><br>
<p>That particular cognitive incident is accompanied by feelings, which I
<br>
conjecture are generated by the ENS, and these feelings comprise the
<br>
experience. Without the sensory input of gut feelings, the frustration,
<br>
irritation, annoyance, etc., which comprise the emotional event, no experience
<br>
ensues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can't a blind physicist argue rationally about sight?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but only if the blind physicist had previously experienced sight (or an
<br>
analog of sight), so that rational thoughts can relate to it. With no
<br>
experience of sight whatsoever, blind physicists would literally not know what
<br>
they were talking about. Without the sensory input of eyes, visual experience
<br>
does not occur. The effect of sensory experience may linger after the form has
<br>
departed, but form always precedes effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you suppose a mathematician does when he generalizes a formula?  Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he necessarily visualize the formula in some way first, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substitute the image of a variable for a constant?  Of does he first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the concepts (not the words) &quot;generalize that 3&quot;, and then perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later conjure up an image and a variable name to help him remember?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the built-in concepts an infant has, like &quot;animated&quot;, before he can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever experience them?  Can we not conjecture about extraterrestrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life without visualizing any particular form or place?
</em><br>
<p>Interesting questions... Calculation and computation evidently don't require
<br>
vision, despite that no blind mathematician ever invented any new mathematics.
<br>
If, however, a form of computation does require experience, it would also
<br>
necessarily entail a sensory phenomenon.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
