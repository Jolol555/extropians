</em><br>
<p>As one who has been through that recently, I understand and encourage
<br>
you to forge right on ahead. I also have crappy undergrad GPA and
<br>
decent scores.  A book I'd recommend is Getting What You Came For by
<br>
Robert Peters <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374524777">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374524777</a>
<br>
<p>All the following is strictly IMO, IIRC, YMMV, WWAFBD?
<br>
<p>Your main hurdle as a returning student, particularly one in a different
<br>
field will not be grades, nor scores, but convincing them that you are
<br>
sincerely interested in and capable of committing to devoting the next
<br>
30 or more years to cognitive science research.
<br>
<p>The most important thing to do is to start reading journal
<br>
articles. Read three or four that interest you per week. Start with
<br>
reviews, and from there track down references that strike your
<br>
interest. I don't know any specific references or journals, since I'm
<br>
not in that field, but maybe somebody else on the list can help in
<br>
that regard. Also, the books you mention probably cite the seminal
<br>
papers in the field. The next step will be to go to the local public
<br>
library and do a reverse citation search for these references on
<br>
www.webofscience.com (it's a subscription site, but it's a good bet
<br>
most libraries have it). The reverse search will give you current
<br>
papers that are citing those references.
<br>
<p>It's also good to keep up with Science and Nature. As you dig up and
<br>
read papers that are interesting to you, you'll get a better idea of
<br>
what it is specifically that you're interested in. You'll start seeing
<br>
the names of the same researchers over and over, and you'll start
<br>
noticing that the researchers in what's fast becoming *your* field of
<br>
interest publish in a particular constellation of journals... which
<br>
you add to the list of journals you monitor every month or so for new
<br>
developments that haven't made it into Web of Science yet.
<br>
<p>Unless you've been doing something related to cognitive science for
<br>
the last few years, you may find that it's tough going understanding
<br>
the research papers because you have forgotten a lot from when you
<br>
learned it in college, or maybe you never had coursework in that area
<br>
to begin with. If the gaps in knowledge are small, you might get away
<br>
with buying a couple of textbooks and teaching yourself. Otherwise,
<br>
you might have to take the appropriate courses as a non-credit student
<br>
at a local college. On the bright side, this will help prepare you for
<br>
the GRE if there is a subject GRE required/available for your field.
<br>
<p>Your reading of the research literature will help you pick a program--
<br>
it will be wherever it is that the most interesting papers are coming
<br>
from. Look up those institutions on the web and download their
<br>
application materials. If you are at all unsure about getting admitted,
<br>
apply to many programs. 20. 30. The only thing it costs you is time and
<br>
money, and it costs you less to apply to many once and get it over with.
<br>
<p>Keep a spreadsheet or database of the mailing addresses, websites,
<br>
admission requirements you still need to fulfill, names and phone
<br>
numbers of relevant individuals, etc. with entries for all the
<br>
institution. Start applying as soon as you've identified several
<br>
institutions of interest, while continuing to follow the research
<br>
literature (i.e.  keep the battle raging on all fronts
<br>
simultaneously).
<br>
<p>Unless you have a specific reason for doing so, do *not* seek an MS.
<br>
Go straight for a PhD. All the Masters students I know are getting a
<br>
really shitty deal. It may be harder to get into a PhD program and you
<br>
will stay in school twice as long, but at least you'll get a stipend
<br>
so you'll have no distractions from their work, the faculty will pay
<br>
more attention to your academic needs, and you'll graduate ready to
<br>
become a full-fledged scientist (in most fields a post-doc is
<br>
customary, but post-docs are full-fledged in my book). Of course your
<br>
stipend will not be a luxurious one, especially if you have
<br>
dependents. For many returning students, grad school is a lifestyle
<br>
adjustment downward. Science is a harsh mistress, what can I say?
<br>
Maybe when Extropians take over the world things will get better.  :-)
<br>
<p>Oh, another thing on what program to apply for. Let's say that there
<br>
are two departments working on similar types of projects, and some of
<br>
the faculty you like might even be crosslisted in both of them. Which
<br>
one to pick? Well, if cog sci is anything like molecular/cell bio, pay
<br>
no attention to what the department is called. What matters is the
<br>
research getting done there. If other things are equal, you might be
<br>
at a slight advantage applying to the smaller program, with the more
<br>
obscure sounding name-- simply because it's human nature to judge a
<br>
book by its cover and the Department of Endocrine Neuropharmachemistry
<br>
may have a harder time filling spaces than the Department of
<br>
Psychiatry.  Of course, do your due diligence to make sure that you'll
<br>
still have the opportunity to work with the people you want to work
<br>
with and that there isn't something horribly wrong with said
<br>
department at the administrative or fiscal levels.
<br>
<p>While you're applying through formal channels, don't neglect to look
<br>
up the emails and phone numbers of the principle investigators whose
<br>
work you've been following. Call them or email them, tell them about
<br>
yourself and how interested you are in their work. Be as specific as
<br>
possible, but concise. Mention that you hope to be able to visit their
<br>
labs and meet them in person sometime. I don't know if this increases
<br>
your chances of getting invited to interviews, but it can't hurt.
<br>
<p>Interviews are crucial. Always accept interview invitations even if
<br>
you think you've already picked the perfect school. All the forms you
<br>
filled out, the tests you took, and all the other bureaucratic crap
<br>
you had to do are just the admission ticket to the interview. All of
<br>
that takes the back seat once you shake the hand of the researcher
<br>
who's going to be deciding whether to admit you or not, look ver in
<br>
the eye and tell ver with absolute conviction that you want to do
<br>
research in ver department and that you believe you'll be great at it.
<br>
I got accepted by every school where I made it to the interview phase.
<br>
<p>At a typical grad school interview, you'll get shown around the
<br>
campus, chat with students, and meet with a mix of researchers. Some
<br>
of them will be the ones you're dying to work with, and some of them
<br>
will be working on projects you don't care about as much, but in
<br>
either case, get them talking about what they do. People love talking
<br>
about themselves, and interviewers are no different. Don't worry,
<br>
you'll get opportunities to pipe up with your accomplishments and
<br>
ideas-- but if your interviewer is doing most of the talking, the
<br>
information you give ver about yourself will better fit into the
<br>
context of what ve is talking about and ve may even start thinking of
<br>
you as already being a member of The Team. If you have any doubts
<br>
about going to the school you're interviewing at, don't show them.  As
<br>
far as they're concerned, their school is your first choice, but of
<br>
course play it cool and don't sound desperate either.
<br>
<p>The main thing not to say at an interview is &quot;I don't know what I want
<br>
to do, but this sounds kind of neat, and I read some cool
<br>
popular-press books on the subject, so I figured I'd try my hand at it
<br>
and see if I like it.&quot; Do or do not, there is no try in grad school.
<br>
And, scientists sometimes view stuff accessible to the general public
<br>
with the same disdain you reserve for the 'technical explanations'
<br>
given for things in science fiction movies.
<br>
<p>I don't mean to imply that an interview is a prerequisite for
<br>
admission. That's just how I got in. Other people's experiences may be
<br>
different. Certainly don't get discouraged if the invites are long in
<br>
coming-- the schools are really unpredictable in when they'll get back
<br>
to you after you've completed your application.
<br>
<p>It's a daunting task, but well worth it. The first time I tried, I was
<br>
so intimidated, I never sent out the applications. Looking back I'm
<br>
realizing that I was good enough all along, and so are you. They WANT
<br>
you, especially if you are a citizen of the country you're applying to
<br>
grad school in; foreigners are expensive because it's harder for them
<br>
to obtain grants, at least in the US. Few people have the ambition and
<br>
the grasp of the big picture to pursue the science track, and if you
<br>
do, the grad schools be glad to have you.
<br>
<p>I wish you the best, and don't hesitate to ask more questions as they
<br>
come up! Extropy needs us.
