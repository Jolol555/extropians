<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Faulty conjecture and bad memetic engineering. If some extropians are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Libertarian and others Republicans, some Democrats, some are

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; above-statement is an untenable generalization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Back when I first heard about extropians, one of the major attractions for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;me was the combination of transhumanism and libertarianism.  In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;that's how I thought of extropians -- as libertarian transhumanists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Because I am unaware of any other defining trait of extropians, as distinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from all transhumanists.
</em><br>
<p>I never figured out why there needed to be a differentiation at this 
<br>
stage.  I consider myself a transhumanist first, and then I'm a member of 
<br>
Extropy Institute because it's the only corporate organization that has 
<br>
been working to create a transhumanist movement.  The principles work well 
<br>
for me, and the philosophy seems to pay attention to changing times and 
<br>
from what I see, is able to keep up and direct itself to the advances quite 
<br>
nicely.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Just because some extropians are libertarian would you think that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was a personality trait of all extropians?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Actually, I don't think of libertarianism as a personality trait at all.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think of it as a worldview, preferably one that has been chosen because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of its consistency and reflection of reality (or how reality seems to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarian, anyway).
</em><br>
<p>Good, then let' not use it as a defining characteristic of a person.  I try 
<br>
not to get caught up in political philosophies or parties.  I'd rather 
<br>
consider each issue on its own merit and consider the economic trends, 
<br>
nationally and globally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I'm not sure what distinguishes extropy from plain transhumanism, if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;advocacy of non-statism.  Can someone help me out here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Good question.  Actually, basically nothing other than a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Extropy&quot;.  Now, if we begin to unravel some of the history of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism got stated you would learn that there were Upwinger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transhumanists, Transhumanist Artists and other smaller groups of futurists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who felt aligned with the transhumanist futurism.  But, really, the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and ideas were first generated in the extropian community.  The word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism came out of the extropian philosophy.  Not the other way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; around.  However, FM-2030, wrote his view of what a transhuman is and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that his &quot;ideology&quot; was significantly transhumanist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm guessing you mean to say, &quot;significantly extropian&quot;, as that would neatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrap this up.   If not, I don't understand what you do mean.
</em><br>
<p>No, significantly transhumanist.  FM was not an extropian, although he 
<br>
thought well of the philosophy.  He was a philosopher himself, and created 
<br>
the Upwingers philosophy and contributed these ideas to form a 
<br>
transhumanist ideology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;By the way, I imagine that &quot;a-political&quot; could easily be used to describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;libertarianism. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sure. I guess so.  Frankly, I think political parties are old world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We agree on this, at least.
</em><br>
<p>Great!  Now let's talk ideas, progress and solutions and not get 
<br>
bottlenecked in political dogma.
