<em>&gt;I see two connections between Leonard's situation and some of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;living at all.  With his memories constantly being erased, is there any
</em><br>

<p>&nbsp;15 minutes of memory is more than zero. It isn't clear to me why there

would be any threshold (other than zero) below which the value of memory

drops to zero.

<p><em>&gt;Some have argued that such a picture is appealing because even though

<p>&nbsp;The last part of that sentence sounds like something I might have said, but
<br>
I have trouble believing that anyone finds loss of pleasant memories appealing.
<br>
&nbsp;I hope to reduce my rate of memory loss, but as long as some memory
<br>
loss appears unavoidable, there seems little benefit to feeling upset
<br>
about it.
