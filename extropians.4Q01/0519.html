<p><em>&gt;another, related factor, that we might call &quot;the fallacy of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interface filter&quot;. By this I mean 1) that people are almost always
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only exposed to those &quot;xenogenic&quot; ideas that are actually carried
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across from a foreign culture into their own, 2) that the ideas that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get carried across the boundary are the ones that &quot;translate&quot; the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into terms comprehensible in the receiving culture and 3) that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific individuals who serve as vectors of cross-cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communication tend to be ones who are not &quot;centered&quot; in their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;culture, but rather have a more cosmopolitan view capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perceiving multiple cultural viewpoints.  All of these factors go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;together to make the view of some specific foreign cultural phenomenon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more or less distorted from the reality of that phenomenon in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;native cultural setting.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, indeed, it's important to get as much information from as many
<br>
perspectives as possible when evaualting a culture/group of people.
<br>
<p>How to learn about a culture/group of people? One can learn from
<br>
books/articles (different sources), and/or one can learn from talking
<br>
to the people (different sources), and/or one can learn from actually
<br>
going there and spending time observing and living.
<br>
<p>To learn some things about the Sufis I've read a few hundred or so of
<br>
their stories/poetry, I spent several years around a couple of people
<br>
who were serious Sufi students, I had several conversations with a man
<br>
(who also ran a Sufi school) delivering grain seed to Afghanistan and
<br>
visited him at his home once, I spent a day with many dozens of
<br>
Afghanistans at their festival, and I met a Sufi Grand Sheikh. The
<br>
latter was while this particular Turkish holy man was visiting the US
<br>
for the first time in 25 years, and he was holding religious evening
<br>
prayers at the nearby Mosque for several hundred Sufis and Muslims (I
<br>
experienced the prayer rituals for 4 or 5 hours while segrated in the
<br>
back of the Mosque with the other ladies). I also went to the home
<br>
where the Turkish Sheikh was staying as a guest, the next morning
<br>
after the prayer ritual, in order to ask him some questions, but there
<br>
were too many people around him, and I had no opportunities to speak
<br>
further with him.
<br>
<p>I agree with you that, to some extent, my information is filtered, but
<br>
I've done almost everything short of actually travelling to and living
<br>
in the places where Sufis and Muslims live.
<br>
<p>Another factor regarding the Sufi ideas, is that they don't place
<br>
strong emphasis on academic/book studies anyway- they would rather the
<br>
lessons be gained by personally experiencing the concepts.  Therefore,
<br>
I suggest to not put a huge amount of weight on books and articles
<br>
regarding Sufism, until you know very well the authors' own biases. To
<br>
be sure he/she has some. In some cases the information will be simply
<br>
wrong. (I would bet a lot of money that the US news sources are closer
<br>
to the latter.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the historical reality of Sufism is quite different from what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comes through the filters working on most of what gets through to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Western intellectuals about Sufism. 
</em><br>
<p>I would be interested in any sources you can point my way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;First factual tidbit: Consider that the word &quot;assassin&quot; comes from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practice of one particular Sufi sect. 
</em><br>
<p>This is a word game... We can find many life-oriented words from the
<br>
Sufis as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Second factual tidbit: Sufism is &quot;guru-oriented&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>This isn't my observation or experience, though. Where did this come
<br>
from?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(as is most of the actual practice of Islam)
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm. I need to think more about this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;encouraging the same kind of deference to the ulama that we see in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extreme forms in the much wider-spread influence of Sunni Wahhabist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fundamentalism in the Islamic world today.
</em><br>
<p>There are extremists in any group, though.
<br>
<p>I assent to the links between Islam and Sufism though- they are
<br>
stronger than I thought previously, because I discovered that the
<br>
Arabic language has some special qualities for the Sufis that other
<br>
languages don't have, plus the Koran codifies some of the Sufi ideas
<br>
more compactly than other religious documents (probably) do.
<br>
<p>One concept that I find useful from the Sufis is to present ideas to
<br>
people using a multilayered approach. For example, with the stories,
<br>
each reading presents something (often totally) new. Also, words in
<br>
Arabic provide incomplete-but-useful maps to the Sufi ideas. If one
<br>
begins with the Arabic root of the word, one can produce more words
<br>
that provide some of the map of Sufic thought. (But this a word game
<br>
too..)
