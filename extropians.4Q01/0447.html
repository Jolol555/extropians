<p>You think I'm a socialist? :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I'd like to suggest you amend this statement

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;The statement should be

</em><br>
<p>My point still stands. Most people are not evil/hate-ridden/greedy/selfish, 
<br>
and yes, they are happy to put up with inequity in their own lives and the 
<br>
lives of others in order to maintain a stable system where they can get on 
<br>
with their lives.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The system doesn't *work*. It just parasitizes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The less it parasitizes, the healthier we all are.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it does work. Many countries using vastly different social systems 
<br>
keep their inhabitants wealthy and healthy like never before in history. 
<br>
Yes, there is some parasitism, but surprise surprise, life is not all about 
<br>
that. There are many people who devote their lives to taking care of their 
<br>
families, or to learning about the scientific nature of the universe, or 
<br>
helping those less fortunate than themselves.
<br>
<p>Have a look around you -- really, it is not all bad. I am not a dewey-eyed 
<br>
utopian, I am a realist. There is plenty still to fix, but things are 
<br>
getting better and have been doing for a long time. If we keep going the 
<br>
way we are then we'll hopefully arrive at the spike just about on time.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  To even attempt making the system work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;requires coercion, because there will ALWAYS
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be people who find your politics (or my politics or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ANBODY'S politics) repellant.
</em><br>
<p>And yet it works...
<br>
Education and being able to understand another person's point of view are 
<br>
the 2 most powerful enablers for change that I know of.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Just because you
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Oh look at me... I'm all warm and fuzzy. :-)
<br>
Ummm... when did I ever suggest Big Brother go a-crusading?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;That's the real problem with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;private production of anything resembling a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replacement for government, isn't it?  If you had
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;power that comes from a barrel of a gun&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;force monopolies that back up the taxation system...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well you might not get as far.
</em><br>
<p>Seems like you are putting words into my mouth, but I can't actually work 
<br>
out what it is that your imaginary version of me is saying...
<br>
Is it saying that private production is bad and government good?
<br>
...that isn't even close to how I think.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;(Don't take that the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way...we ALL have Utopian notions :)
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm, I have utopian notions, though I don't think I have spoken of them on 
<br>
this list. You probably think you know what mine are, but you'd be surprised.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
