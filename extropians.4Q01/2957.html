<em>&gt; &gt; This is why I, like Spike, advocate the use of overwhelming force in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; war: the enemy needs to KNOW, all the way down to his gonads, that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way is utterly wrong and ours is utterly right before he will accept the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sort of surrender we need to ensure that we don't have to fight them all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over again a few decades later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you actually believe that might makes right?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - samantha
</em><br>
<p>When you /are/ right (for other reasons), it's nice to have some
<br>
might to protect yourself from those who are wrong.  And even, as
<br>
in this case, when you're only slightly less wrong than the other
<br>
guy.  Sure, we've done some wrong things, but nothing even
<br>
remotely close to unthinkable horrors of Pearl Harbor or WTC.
<br>
<p>Evil exists.  Some people, nations, and cultures are evil and wrong
<br>
and dangerous.  Denial of this simple fact won't make it go away.
<br>
A couple of well-placed nukes 50 years ago did make some of it go 
<br>
away for a long time, and Mike is just pointing that out.  That
<br>
particular method won't work in Afghanistan or against Al-Qaeda, but
<br>
let's hope we can find a method that does.
