<p>Yes, but it can take 4-6 weeks to build an effective immune system

response.  By then millions of people might have been infected.

<p><em>&gt; I think that it's just abominable that we've stopped

<p>The cost benefit ratio was on the side of not vaccinating.
<br>
Vaccines can cause severe reactions in certain individuals.
<br>
Once we sort out the molecular biology a bit more, we &quot;should&quot;
<br>
be able to create much more effective vaccines as well as determine
<br>
who should not receive them.  But it may take us 10 years to accumulate
<br>
sufficient knowledge for that to be the case.
<br>
<p>Regarding DNA &amp; radioactivity sensing watches -- I like the idea.
<br>
The technology probably isn't &quot;quite&quot; that advanced yet but I could 
<br>
certainly see it getting there over the next decade.  Its a pretty
<br>
good MEMS application.
<br>
<p>What one really needs is better anti-toxin research.  A group at
<br>
Harvard has found a way to defeat the anthrax anti-toxin.  Similar
<br>
work should be done for other agents that might be used as weapons
<br>
as well.  One would also like to develop enzymes that can rapidly
<br>
metabolize various chemical weapons.
