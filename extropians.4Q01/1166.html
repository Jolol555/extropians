|Thinking of people in terms of &quot;countries&quot; instead of individuals is
<br>
|part of the problem.  I have no respect for patriots; I am a free man
<br>
|not because I happened to be born within US borders, I am a free man
<br>
|because I am alive.  I do not ask for entitlements to anything but
<br>
|the freedom to associate and deal with those who freely choose to
<br>
|associate and deal with me--and I must therefore grant those same
<br>
|rights to everyone else, regardless of their &quot;nationality&quot; or any
<br>
|other artificial category.  If the government that has presently
<br>
|imposed itself upon this soil supports such honest and voluntary
<br>
|dealings among free men, then it can be tolerated.  If it does not,
<br>
|then it is my enemy.
<br>
<p>Yes, if the members of the said group, ``government'', tries to impose its
<br>
resttrictions on a involuntary basis.  I have no problems with members of
<br>
a group imposing their own laws for the voluntary members of the group.
