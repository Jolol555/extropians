</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and regulatory policies pursued during that period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many economists would indicate that the entire marketplace is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wracked by irrationality; irrational exuberence, irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pessimism, irrational greed, ad naseum.
</em><br>
<p>You got that right.  This kind of pushes off the explanation for
<br>
economic phenomena to pop psychology.  This is nice hand waving that the
<br>
public eats write up, but it doesn't explain anything.  It's too bad
<br>
Keynes made it fashionable to do this and that the fashion has stuck
<br>
since the 1930s.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I seem to recall from the last 18 months, is the beliefs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the economic goodtimes were over (in part) because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OPEC creeps, jacking up prices. Whether this is true, is open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to question.
</em><br>
<p>It might be too early to tell which was the trigger, but the inflation
<br>
and the regulatory regime definitely impacted the economy to make a) the
<br>
triggering reaction possible and b) the outcome: a bust.  Absent these
<br>
factors, an increase in oil prices -- which I personally doubt was _the_
<br>
trigger -- or a variety of other triggers would have just been one more
<br>
variable for people to account for rather than the unveiling of a
<br>
investment structure that was rickety and ready to collapse.
<br>
<p>See also <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/prices.htm">http://www.wtrg.com/prices.htm</a> , which doesn't show the kind of
<br>
correlation you're talking about.  During much of the 1980s, crude oil
<br>
prices were well above current prices, yet, by most lights, these were
<br>
boom times.  I also think the oil shortage of the 1970s did have an
<br>
economic economic, but the inflation of the same period was much more
<br>
significant and not driven by oil prices, but instead by the US going
<br>
off the gold standard and the using inflation to monetize government
<br>
debt.  (I'm not a gold bug here.  I don't the gold standard is a cure
<br>
all for banking ills.  If a central bank remains in place, a lot of the
<br>
same problems will play out, gold or no.  See Kevin Dowd's
<br>
_Laissez-Faire Banking_ and many of his other works on banking.)
<br>
<p>Also, inflation is a strictly monetary phenomena.  Yes, it has real
<br>
effects -- the business cycle being one of them -- but it is because
<br>
prices, especially relative prices -- the prices between goods as
<br>
opposed to the overall price level -- distorts economic activity.
<br>
Malinvestments occur and when the game is up, they are usually hard to
<br>
liquidate, leading to real losses.  In other words, entrepreneurs are
<br>
fooled into believing there are real opportunities when there are
<br>
none -- or much less than they anticipated across the board.  (This
<br>
matters more in the area of capital, since a lot of capital is highly
<br>
specific and is hard to shift around, especially to shift around
<br>
costlessly to new uses.  See Roger Garrison's _Time and Money_ and
<br>
Stephen Horwitz's _Microfoundations and Macroeconomics_.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would claim the mere perception of such an occurence, was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to pop the dot.com bubble.
</em><br>
<p>I would not.  I think the bubble popped because real factors caught up
<br>
with monetary ones.  Inflation, on the macroeconomic levels leads to
<br>
unsustainable growth.  Why?  Well, one way of putting is that investment
<br>
and consumption both grow, though investment predominates.  This means
<br>
that as consumers, people plan to spend more, but as investors, they
<br>
also plan to invest more.  In the real world, you can't have your cake
<br>
and eat it too, but inflation's impact makes it seem like you can.  In
<br>
fact, because a money economy only loosely links -- due to time lags --
<br>
the money supply with the demand for money, stuff like this can happen.
<br>
(Under a free banking regime, this process would be swifting
<br>
self-correcting, since individual inflating banks would lose reserves
<br>
and even go bankrupt.  Banks that didn't inflate would increase market
<br>
share.  In other words, inflating would directly hurt the inflating firm
<br>
in a very short time -- very much shorter than your average boom and
<br>
likely in a matter of weeks or less.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember, that Greenspan was using the post WW2 German
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model that inflation causes recession/depression and that low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inflation was the target-goal.
</em><br>
<p>That might have been his rhetoric, but actual Fed and international
<br>
monetary policy (often led by the Fed) was inflationary and risk
<br>
externalizing -- allowing risk takers to pass risk along.  Examples of
<br>
the former include the lowering of interests from 1996 until 2000.
<br>
Examples of the latter include the repeated instance of government
<br>
funded or arranged bailouts -- in Mexico, Asia, Russia, and of Long Term
<br>
Capital Management.  Such bailouts pass the buck on risk taking.
<br>
<p>Also, the deficit reduction policy -- hide the deficit under Social
<br>
Security and pretend it doesn't exist -- now in place adds more wood to
<br>
the fire.  We could have a much more efficient market with sustainable
<br>
growth if all these policies were reduced or, even better, gotten rid
<br>
of.  The latter would, to my mind, be the more Extropian policy since it
<br>
would allow higher levels of wealth production and social
<br>
coordination -- i.e., of socio-economic extropy.:)
<br>
<p>Also, it's not the German model but the Austrian model of von Mises and
<br>
Hayek.  Granted, the German central bank has tried to sell itself as
<br>
anti-inflationary, but it doesn't completely live up to its rhetoric
<br>
either.  The actual track record shows that bank fluctuating between a
<br>
low inflationary policy and a higher one -- though not as high as many
<br>
of its neighbors at the same time.  See, e.g., &quot;The Rise and Fall of the
<br>
German Miracle&quot; by Wolgang Kerber and Sandra Hartig (_Critical Review_
<br>
13(3-4): 337-358).
<br>
<p>Of course, inflation is not the only problem with the German economy --
<br>
now in recession, by the way.  It has a bloated public sector, a lot of
<br>
economic regulation, and reunification hasn't helped matters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The method was to use minetary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy to prevent the typical 'business cycle' to close, and thus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetuate the prosperity that we experienced during most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 1990's.
</em><br>
<p>Admittedly, the Fed does try to out-think the market, but there are two
<br>
problems with this.  First, the Fed modeling of the economy can hardly
<br>
predict the effects of inflation.  If it could do this well, ex ante,
<br>
then you'd have a strong argument for socialism.  In fact, it would have
<br>
solved the socialist calculation problem!  (Again, I counsel ditching
<br>
the Fed and going to a free market banking system.  Kevin Dowd offers
<br>
some suggestions on just how to do this with minimal pain in the closing
<br>
pages of his 1996 book _Competition and Finance: A Reinterpretation of
<br>
Financial and Monetary Economics_.)
<br>
<p>Second, this is a different time.  The Fed is closely watched and market
<br>
actors (banks, brokers, hedge funds, etc.) closely follow Fed
<br>
activities -- open market operations, fiddlings with the prime rate and
<br>
reserve ratios, and other tools and reports.  This doesn't mean these
<br>
actors make perfect calls, but they arbitrage out some intended affects,
<br>
often to dampen or hide the impact, making prediction and tracking even
<br>
harder.  (Add to this, risk externalization and other changes in the
<br>
overall economy make this time a little different than previous
<br>
downturns.)
<br>
<p>Third, incentives are really not there for the Fed not to inflate.
<br>
After all, despite the rhetoric, inflation is politically sexy.  In the
<br>
short run, it usually pushes up the stock market, lowers unemployment,
<br>
and increases consumer spending.  Its bad effects only come later when
<br>
the discoordinations work themselves through the economy.  (If this
<br>
weren't so, central banks would have little reason to inflate and the
<br>
whole history of the 20th century would not be marred by inflationary
<br>
policies.)
<br>
<p>Fourth, the Fed is not Greenspan.  He's only one man on the Board -- not
<br>
the whole shebang.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further comment: German style anti-inflationary policy, in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ensure a prosperity, does not work when the cause of inflation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in outside of banking control. What is outside of banking control?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The OPEC bastards, or more formally, the Wahabbis. My sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that the dot.com bomb, combined with the foolishness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government policy in California, helped jack up the price of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domestic natural gas costs. Remember that?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, these things are not inflationary per se.  Granted, they can
<br>
make for shocks to the economy and that's no laughing matter, but
<br>
inflation is specifically a monetary phenomena -- i.e., when money
<br>
supply exceeds the effective demands for money.  (In the US, this can
<br>
happen only through the Fed lowering interest rates, buying government
<br>
securities, or lowering reserve requirements for banks.  Well, that and
<br>
any other new way to create fiat money.)  A shock like a sudden jump in
<br>
the price of some good is a _real_ not a _monetary_ happening.
<br>
<p>A good way to separate the two is think of a barter economy.  In a
<br>
barter economy, there is, by definition, no money, hence no inflation.
<br>
Yet, under such a system, something could, e.g., decrease the supply of
<br>
some good like, say, cattle.  Disease might hit the heard.  That would
<br>
make for less cows and those who had cows or cow products might be able
<br>
to trade them for more of other stuff.  But the effects would not
<br>
systematically distort perceptions.  Most people who trade for cows and
<br>
cow products would know right away that there are less cows and cow
<br>
products.  (They might not know why, but there would be no way to spread
<br>
the mailaise beyond the cow shortage.  Not that I'm advocating a return
<br>
to barter.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The economy was deflating during 2000,
</em><br>
<p>At best, the the Fed rates were higher.  Whether this was inflation
<br>
(could still be so, since inflation could either increase at a slower
<br>
differential rate -- e.g., if the rise was expected to be 2% and only
<br>
rose 1.5% -- or if the Fed's other operations actually nullified rate
<br>
cuts), disinflation (i.e., lowering the rate of inflation -- e.g., if
<br>
the absolute level was expect to be 5% and was actually 3%) or deflation
<br>
is debatable.  I definitely do not think deflation -- i.e., when the
<br>
effective demand for money exceeds its supply -- occurred.
<br>
<p>At best, I think there was mild deflation, though many on the market
<br>
expected continued increases in money supply and overall credit
<br>
loosening.  Four years of such policies -- such as the Fed giving a lot
<br>
of the debtors what they wanted -- habituated people for this.  (Look at
<br>
the prime rate during that time frame.  Also, consider that Fed policy
<br>
is not the whole interest rate picture, though it is a commanding part
<br>
of it.  If the Fed lowers rates, but the government is actually
<br>
borrowing more, this can drive up market rates because the supply of
<br>
loanable funds will be much lower than without government borrowing.)
<br>
When it did not come, that spelled the end, but the end would have
<br>
sooner or later as eventually the contradiction between investments and
<br>
profits and between risk premia and actual results came to fruition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and all the interest-rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cuts have done squat (although iy supposedly takes at least 12
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mos for the interest rate cuts to generate a response).
</em><br>
<p>Part of this is that it takes a long time to reallign capital.  Workers
<br>
can much more easily, though no costlessly move about.  Capital usually
<br>
can't.  Relatively to workers capital is much harder in most cases to
<br>
change to other uses and often involves huge losses.  (Capital is
<br>
actually quite heterogeneous too, something that Fed and monetary models
<br>
hardly take into account.  It's not a lump of stuff that's infinitely
<br>
malleable.  That's why we see many businesses that are suddenly
<br>
worthless.  They put together capital combinations that just weren't
<br>
profitable and were often extremely sensitive to interest rate changes.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 9-11
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformed the economy from a weak one, into a recessionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one. Which points up the need to develop an alternative to petroleum.
</em><br>
<p>I think the September 11th attacks only gave the government to come out
<br>
and use the R word.  Even they admit, the economy was in recession by
<br>
their definition months before the attacks.  The attacks just made it
<br>
politically feasible to say so.  (Again, this plays into the pop
<br>
psychology view of markets.  The President and the former President both
<br>
saw business confidence as some sort of fickle primary.  Instead, it's
<br>
actually based on market results and expectations.  Business people feel
<br>
more confident when their succeeding and they expect to keep succeeding.
<br>
The Keynesian &quot;animal spirits&quot; tripe has got to be disposed of if we're
<br>
ever to hope to understand the economy.)
<br>
<p>Happy Holidays!
