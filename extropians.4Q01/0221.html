I recall a scene from _Illuminatus!_ where an ancient Atlantean
<br>
scientist overcomes his vague feelings of guilt by doing something
<br>
(firing a rocket into the sun which results in a solar flare wiping out
<br>
most of humanity) that gives him a definite unmistakeable sense of
<br>
really heavy guilt.
<br>
<p>So, to run an effective terrorist organization, especially one that
<br>
relies on suicide bombers, you'd order new recruits to do something
<br>
terrible, like murdering some random child. This might instill a sense
<br>
of probably going to hell, which can then be avoided by becoming a
<br>
martyr for the faith. But the guilt itself might also be a factor, like
<br>
in 'yes, the infidels are my enemies, but the one i shot was an innocent
<br>
child', which would then be a continual nagging psychic wound. Closure
<br>
might be achieved by then suiciding yourself via crashing an airplane
<br>
into a skyscraper, kiling thousands, because now you are *really* a
<br>
guilty bastard. No more doubt about it.
<br>
<p>The religious aspects with the promised glorius afterlife then need not
<br>
be more than a dim hope. Combined with promises to look after the
<br>
martyr's family, there would be both economic and psychic benefits to
<br>
martyrdom.
<br>
<p>Let's assume Osama had knowledge and approval of the 9/11 attacks. Being
<br>
a terror kingpin, he isn't a willing suicide bomber himself, thus
<br>
remaining alive, so the terrorist attacks simply contribute to his sense
<br>
of nagging guilt. Only by goading the west into a reaction that goads
<br>
the islamic world into a total holy war will these nagging feelings of
<br>
guilt be resolved. One way that closure would be achieved here is in the
<br>
purity-thru-fire nuclear annihilation of islamic peoples. And there's
<br>
always the dim hope of victory (or paradise). And the embarassing
<br>
question of why the west is ahead while the superior islamic culture
<br>
should be dominant could be avoided.
<br>
<p>Is this it? Is the whole islamic terrorist agenda just a rationalized
<br>
death wish?
