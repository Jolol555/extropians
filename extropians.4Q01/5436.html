<p>Am I the only one then, who thinks that we have to be very, very careful

about how we treat other persons and other nations? There is at last

something I like about this &quot;concealed carry&quot; topic: From now on, almost 
<br>
every person on this planet carries enough &quot;concealed&quot; knowledge to become 
<br>
really dangerous for all of us. And the possible damage that one person can 
<br>
achieve raises with the development of &quot;empowering&quot; technology. Do you feel 
<br>
more safe now?
