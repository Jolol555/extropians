<p>So Randy, how do you propose to keep immigrants out of this country?
<br>
Have the GOVERNMENT tell them they may not exercise their INALIENABLE
<br>
RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY, and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS by voting with
<br>
their feet, which is what they do when they seek to follow the
<br>
AMERICAN DREAM? I mean, don't you think that everybody smart enough to
<br>
understand that the AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE IS SUPERIOR is automatically
<br>
on our side? Furthermore, what shall we do about the ones who DON'T
<br>
LISTEN TO WHAT GOVERNMENTS SAY and cross the imaginary lines
<br>
GOVERNMENTS call borders? Should the GOVERNMENT collect a TAX AND
<br>
SPEND it on more border guards? I don't know about you, Randy, but as
<br>
a PATRIOTIC AMERICAN I believe that the FREE MARKET should take care
<br>
of the so-called immigration problem, without BIG GOVERNMENT MEDDLING
<br>
with who a company may and may not hire. Stop being such a COMMIE
<br>
LIBERAL PINKO, Randy.
<br>
<p>Btw, Randy, I now live in TEXAS. TEXAS was founded by AMERICANS
<br>
emigrating to Mexico and then getting all uppity. Maybe you're right,
<br>
Randy, immigrants are trouble. They move in, they start expecting to
<br>
participate in the democratic process, they settle into these freaky
<br>
ethnic neighborhoods and it's really hard to root 'em out once they
<br>
do. I mean, look what a hard time General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna
<br>
had cleansing my new HOME TOWN, San Antonnio, of their foul foreign
<br>
stench! All to no avail, because they just came back again, and in
<br>
greater numbers. Too bad you weren't around back then, Randy, I'm sure
<br>
you would have been a great help to Santa Anna. YOU MEXICAN COMMUNIST
<br>
LIBERAL PINKO.
<br>
