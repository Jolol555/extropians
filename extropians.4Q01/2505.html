<p>&quot;Don't do it at all&quot; - that is, advising the USgov not to pursue the
<br>
research - could easily be worse than doing it closed.  Though I also
<br>
agree that doing it closed is better than doing it open... although I
<br>
*need* access to nanocomputers immediately after they're developed, and
<br>
that may be harder to get if nanocomputers are classified.
<br>
<p>&quot;Don't do it at all&quot; is just not an option.  Someone's going to do it.  If
<br>
you can't develop nanotech safely in public, and you can't develop
<br>
nanotech safely in private, and you can't beat nanotech to the punch, then
<br>
you're dead, and that's that.  The idea of not developing nanotech is an
<br>
illusory last resort.  There is no resort at that point; you're gone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would trust the USA government with it more than leaving it open for
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this really is so dangerous it should just be left alone?
</em><br>
<p>Not an option, I'm afraid.  Look at the subject line of this thread.
