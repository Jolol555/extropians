<em>&gt; &gt; I wonder how these RPG references look to outsiders?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probably around the same way that Myers-Briggs and the Enneagram look to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me:  Darned silly.  Which is the point I was trying to make with all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.  Any system of phrenology works about equally well, whether it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Myers-Briggs, the Enneagram, the AD&amp;D alignment wheel, or White Wolf's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nature/Demeanor system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I consider the gaming systems to be superior, since they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created by highly creative people, with a sense of humor, who had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customers to satisfy; this in contrast to ivory towerfolk who take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves far too seriously.  I'd rather know whether someone is lawful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or chaotic than introverted or extroverted, and the Natures and Demeanors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strike me as being more specific (they more clearly fit or not fit a given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facet of a given personality) than the Enneagram types.  When creative,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smart people try to have fun, useful ideas can come out of it; but Ifni
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserve me from social scientists.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't place Myers-Briggs quite in the same camp with homeopathy,
<br>
but I do agree that what it measures is pretty arbitrary.  It does,
<br>
however, clearly measure _something_, as evidenced by the fact that
<br>
so many of use here are *NT*, and many other self-selected groups of
<br>
people similarly have high correlations.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, one of my fellow editors of &lt;<a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/">http://www.wikipedia.com/</a>&gt;
<br>
is a devout Christian who lists himself as an INTJ with comment &quot;I *live*
<br>
to make rules&quot;.  I invited him to ponder me, a fellow INTJ who is a
<br>
radical anti-intellectual-property anarchocapitalist and atheist.
