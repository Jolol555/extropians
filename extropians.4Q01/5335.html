<p>
My PC had something of a nervous breakdown over the last few days, and
<br>
someone tried to burn down Sydney (nearly did it too!) so this is something
<br>
of a mixed bag of thoughts on the last few issues of v6: 
<br>
<p>In v6#354 Mike Lorrey said: &quot;the Japanese government has never apologized
<br>
for this treatment, generally denies that it took place in their history
<br>
books, and has never paid a dime to the survivors or their families,&quot;
<br>
<p>In a wider context this is true, however there have been recent (small)
<br>
victories by the so-called &quot;comfort women&quot;, women, usually of Asian decent,
<br>
who were forced into sexual servitude for Japanese soldiers, their treatment
<br>
in many cases so bad that they were virtually kept in &quot;rape camps&quot;. In SOME
<br>
countries these women have won compensation (albeit tiny), however no
<br>
apologies have been given by the Japanese government. There are numerous
<br>
documentary sources for these, and other, atrocities, one of the best the
<br>
recent &quot;Hell: War in the Pacific&quot; series recently broadcast on Australian
<br>
TV. It should be noted however, that these atrocities were not one-sided -
<br>
the aforementioned TV series also depicted through interview and previously
<br>
unreleased film footage, atrocities committed by Allied troops, particularly
<br>
in regard to the killing of surrendered soldiers and Japanese nationals
<br>
including women &amp; children. 
<br>
<p>In v6#355 Mike Lorrey said: &quot;In Afghanistan, Afghan and al Qaeda
<br>
prisoners are not tortured in any way by US forces, no drugs, no
<br>
physical force is used.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mike - unfortunately this statement (at the moment anyway) cannot be proven
<br>
(or disproven), however I should point out that the US has a far from
<br>
sterling history in this regard, often using &amp; training operatives from
<br>
client countries to perform the dirty work of torture (eg El Salvador,
<br>
Vietnam, Laos etc). Given the tight press restrictions the US places on
<br>
coverage on the war in Afghanistan (as they did in the Gulf War), we back
<br>
home have next to no idea of what may or may not be actually occurring, and
<br>
given events like Mai Lai &amp; US actions in numerous countries over the last
<br>
40 years it would be foolish to assume that the US is acting beyond any
<br>
reproach, something I'm sure the Pashtar tribesmen of Afghanistan would
<br>
happily tell you (funny how 60 odd prominent but &quot;difficult&quot; tribal
<br>
representatives could be killed &quot;accidentally&quot; by US forces, no?). 
<br>
<p>In v6#355 Technotransendence wrote: &quot;As for the United States and other
<br>
nations, the best foreign aid policy is no foreign aid.  Let people trade if
<br>
they want to, but don't take money forcibly from anyone here to give to
<br>
anyone anywhere else - or vice versa.  (An extra special added bonus of this
<br>
&quot;no aid&quot; policy no
<br>
one can never accuse you of meddling or neo-colonialism.:)&quot;
<br>
<p>Techno - a very easy statement for you to make - you have access to power, a
<br>
computer, the internet, clean water and hospitals. Most of the world does
<br>
not. We as a species really do need to learn not to live in luxury at the
<br>
expense of the majority - if we don't learn this NOW, how the hell will we
<br>
cope when new technologies make the majority of jobs redundant? When only a
<br>
tiny percentage of the population can find ANY meaningful paid employment,
<br>
who will feed you, your friends and family? Should you then live in shit,
<br>
disease &amp; starvation? I somehow suspect you will have a very different idea
<br>
of &quot;welfare&quot; &amp; &quot;foreign aid&quot; then.
<br>
<p>In v6#356 Mike Lorrey wrote: &quot;Then they are far more predisposed to support
<br>
the establishment of the sort of police state repressions needed to launch a
<br>
socialist revolution.&quot;
<br>
<p>This seems to be conspiracy theorist nonsense to me, or at least an excess
<br>
of imagination...why would these people want a socialist revolution? And
<br>
what do you mean by socialist? If you are referring to the monolithic
<br>
stupidity &amp; horrific excesses of countries like the People's Republic of
<br>
China or the old USSR, even the most ardent leftists are not interested in
<br>
repeating those mistakes...
<br>
<p>I find it really strange that some extropians (&amp; other transhumanist &amp;
<br>
futurist movements) are so frightened of core socialist ideals (like sharing
<br>
&amp; joint public ownership of assets) while at the same time espousing
<br>
technologies that should lead to a culture of superabundance &amp; a new type of
<br>
economy that quite probably will have some of it's roots in garden variety
<br>
socialism, &amp; (given technical advances that will change so much of
<br>
manufacturing &amp; the very notion of &quot;work&quot;) may by sheer necessity involve
<br>
some form of &quot;welfare&quot; for the majority of citizens (the SF Ian M Bainks is
<br>
a good place to look for a dynamic post human, post singularity society that
<br>
&quot;works&quot;, despite the fact that just about no-one works)
<br>
<p>(please do not think I'm picking on you by the way - I may not agree with
<br>
you, but I do admire your courage in sticking to your convictions as a
<br>
(political) conservative in a primarily liberal forum)
<br>
<p>In vol6#356 &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; said a whole bunch stuff. Bravo! Me Too!
<br>
While I do not deny the dangers that we as a species face, including the
<br>
much feared &quot;hard takeoff&quot;, I see the coming spike as our chance to FINALLY
<br>
bring about some real change as MORAL BEINGS, our chance (if we avoid the
<br>
pitfalls) to finally live up to our evolutionary potential &amp; step outside
<br>
the awful scrambling for dominance &amp; resources that has made so much of
<br>
human history and achievement a bloodbath. Becoming transhuman should mean
<br>
more than just having better bodies, or better brains, or being better
<br>
adapted to new environments &amp; technologies, it should be about becoming
<br>
better people as well. Without an ethical revolution, any of our
<br>
technological victories will be as empty as the nightmares of the hard
<br>
takeoff advocates.  
<br>
<p>In V6#358 Mike wrote : &quot;Most large cities have far more restrictive gun laws
<br>
than the states in which they are located, and states and cities that are
<br>
dominated by the Democratic Party politically have far more restrictive gun
<br>
laws than those that are not (note that most laws restricting carrying of
<br>
concealed weapons date back to the passage of Jim Crow laws, to prevent
<br>
blacks from protecting themselves from KKK raiders, who were usually armed
<br>
by local law enforcement authorities.)
<br>
<p>San Francisco, New York City, Chicago, Washington DC, St. Louis, and many
<br>
other such cities highly restrict the carrying of concealed weapons by law
<br>
abiding private citizens, if not banning such outright. These cities also
<br>
exhibit the highest violent crime rates. If you remove the crime data
<br>
originating from such restrictive jurisdictions from US violent crime rates,
<br>
you will find that the corrected crime rate is far lower than most other
<br>
industrialized nations (you will also find that removing these large
<br>
democrat controlled cities from the mix helps to make the US demographics to
<br>
compare more similarly to other industrialized nations).&quot;
<br>
<p>Now it all becomes clear: Democrats emit a substance, similar to phlogiston,
<br>
that creates murderous &amp; violent impulses in those exposed, especially those
<br>
of lesser races, driving them to commit all sorts of barbarous acts against
<br>
decent, law abiding, gun carrying, Republican voting, white folks. The San
<br>
Francisco strain is of Democrat seems to be particularly dangerous, driving
<br>
normally god-fearing folks to sodomy, mongrelisation &amp; the eating of
<br>
seafood! Damn those evil Democrats! They must be in league with the ACLU,
<br>
the NEA &amp; Satan himself! 
<br>
<p>Really Mike. If you remove all the areas where there are homicides involving
<br>
guns, because you claim it somehow skews the data, then of course liberal
<br>
gun laws look safe. Your theory that it's restrictive gun laws that make
<br>
areas like LA dangerous does not hold up to close scrutiny when you account
<br>
for the fact that while LA's gun laws may be strict by your standards, they
<br>
are still incredibly loose in comparison to the gun laws in other non-USA
<br>
cities (like Sydney or Tokyo) that have very low homicide &amp; gun related
<br>
injury rates. Twisting the statistics to fit your own desired outcome is
<br>
just bad science, bad form, and, I would have thought, beneath you. 
<br>
<p>On the same topic: V6#358 Kai said: &quot;Ah, I see. This would mean, that US
<br>
Americans are about four times more violent and potential criminals than
<br>
citizens of other western countries. Hm. The USA a 3rd world country? Hm.
<br>
This brings Mikes argument about not trusting non-residents and immigrants
<br>
back into mind. Europe, Asia and Australia should, following this argument,
<br>
not trust US citizens to behave 
<br>
according to our civil, low crime society here and restrict visas and such.
<br>
Hm.&quot;
<br>
<p>Spot on Kai. If you discount guns as a major factor in American violence
<br>
then it MUST be American society &amp; the American people who are so very
<br>
violent. A pretty scary thought considering all the deadly toys you people
<br>
have...
<br>
<p><p>V6#358 Spudboy100 said: &quot;Notice that the Japanese electorate seem content to
<br>
live in a less, plush, economy during the last 10 years, while the USA
<br>
enjoyed the longest prosperity in its history.&quot; (italics added)
<br>
<p>Don't you people notice the growing income disparity in the USA? The fact a
<br>
smaller &amp; smaller percentage of people are hoarding more &amp; more of the
<br>
wealth while the country goes to hell? The number of homeless? The appalling
<br>
state of public medicine? The increasing violence? The high suicide rate?
<br>
The huge growth in your prison populations? The falling education standards?
<br>
The slow death of work for those with poor educations, poor grades or just
<br>
plain poor? The rise of a culture of blame but no action, of litigation over
<br>
invention, of convenience over justice, of lies over truth, of mine, mine,
<br>
mine &amp; screw everyone else? Is this really what we mean by prosperity? 
<br>
<p>V6#358 J.R. Molloy said: &quot;Europe, Asia, and Australia have been quite
<br>
restrictive about immigration. IIRC Australia only recently lifted
<br>
restrictions on immigration. Do you know what year it was that Australia
<br>
finally lifted immigration restrictions?&quot;
<br>
<p>Actually, Australia's stance on immigration has sunk to new lows in the last
<br>
few years. We automatically detain refugees (sorry &quot;asylum seekers&quot;), the
<br>
ONLY country to do so. We detain many of these people in total isolation,
<br>
literally, in jail, in the desert. We break international maritime law. We
<br>
break UN human rights agreements that we are signatory to. We keep already
<br>
traumatised  children in jail, where they are regularly searched, subjected
<br>
to roll calls at all hours, &amp; where they witness the more desperate refugees
<br>
self harm themselves (some have seen self immolation, hangings and the good
<br>
old wrist slash). There are allegations that some of these children have
<br>
been physically and even sexually abused, not just by other &quot;asylum seekers&quot;
<br>
at the detention centres, or whilst in their native land, but by the STAFF
<br>
at these &quot;detention centres&quot; (the government refuses to allow a formal
<br>
inquiry or even entertain the idea of an independent medical examiner for
<br>
this or other health based issues). These children have no access to any
<br>
form of psychiatric care. We hold all these people, and, if we do not have
<br>
diplomatic relations with their homeland, we hold them indefinitely, without
<br>
review. We treat people who are fleeing the Taliban in fear of their lives,
<br>
and who are recognised by the UN as genuine refugees, WORSE than we have
<br>
ever treated POW's, despite the fact that they are fleeing a regime that we
<br>
are at WAR with. Criminals convicted of violent crimes, including rape &amp;
<br>
murder have more rights than these poor unfortunates, many of whom have
<br>
given up everything &amp; risked their lives (over 150 died recently as one of
<br>
their boats sunk) to seek shelter in Australia 
<br>
<p>Words cannot express the sheer disgust I feel for my country, and my
<br>
government at the moment. The Australian public has been consistently lied
<br>
to by it's government &amp; manipulated by the basest of emotions: fear. I love
<br>
my country, but now...I'm just so ashamed.
