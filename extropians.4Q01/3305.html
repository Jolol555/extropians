</em><br>
<p>...no.
<br>
<p>_Nanosystems_, arguing that nanotech is possible, assumes that a single
<br>
radiation failure knocks out a whole subassembly.  This is the
<br>
conservative assumption, although I'm less sure about the conservativeness
<br>
of assuming that the resulting failure consists of the assembly going
<br>
offline, rather than beginning to produce distorted components.  I've
<br>
often suspected that the first nanoassembler will not be automated but
<br>
will instead involve a hundred trained engineers as controllers, for
<br>
exactly this reason.  Anyway...
<br>
<p>Assuming that one radiation strike, anywhere, knocks out a nanobot, is an
<br>
EXTREMELY unconservative assumption in discussions of military
<br>
nanotechnology.  You can't just move &quot;conservative&quot; assumptions from one
<br>
domain to another without checking whether they're still conservative.  In
<br>
particulary, you can't use _Nanosystems_ design assumptions if you're
<br>
arguing for a *limitation* on an offensive nanotech capability because
<br>
_Nanosystems_ is trying to be conservative for a *possibility proof*. 
<br>
(_Some Limits to Global Ecophagy_ contains some particularly blatant
<br>
violations of this principle, for example in discussing how much shielding
<br>
an aerovore requires.)
<br>
<p>Molecules can be error-tolerant.  Advanced biology is error-tolerant
<br>
because advanced biology is created by a long history of evolution, and
<br>
each individual evolutionary mutation (as opposed to recombination) is an
<br>
&quot;error&quot;.  Biology does not evolve except on substrates that involve
<br>
relatively smooth fitness landscapes, because that is a necessary past
<br>
characteristic of organisms that currently possess a long evolutionary
<br>
history.  If there were ever organisms that didn't use error-tolerant
<br>
substrates, we don't see them today; they didn't evolve fast enough.
<br>
<p>Biology clearly demonstrates that it is possible to build highly
<br>
error-tolerant organisms, albeit using proteins bound together by Van der
<br>
Waals forces instead of molecular bonds, which is why biological machinery
<br>
is so much weaker and larger than diamondoid machinery.  But there is no
<br>
reason why a similar design principle could not be applied to diamondoid;
<br>
model the results of radiation strikes, then design radiation-tolerant
<br>
molecules.  Similarly, larger assemblies can be designed which lack single
<br>
points of failure.
<br>
<p>Just as biology necessarily solved the problem of error-tolerance as a
<br>
prerequisite of evolution, nanotech may need to solve the
<br>
single-point-of-failure problem as a prerequisite of debugging.  If matter
<br>
is software, after all, then it needs to be debugged.
<br>
<p>The computing industry has been putting off the problem of designing
<br>
computer programs which lack single points of failure for some time, since
<br>
today you can get away with just rebooting the computer.  Companies that
<br>
wish to ensure reliability are still trying to build completely debugged
<br>
software rather than bug-resistant software.
<br>
<p>We may need to move on to bug-resistant software before we can create
<br>
nanotechnology.  I'm not sure I buy the idea that a gigaatom structure can
<br>
be completely debugged by a human-level intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Though I've mentioned it only briefly in previous posts, scientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at Los Alamos have proposed methods for transmuting radioactive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isotopes back into stable isotopes.  What has been lacking is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an effecient inexpensive separation technology (for the radioactive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs. non-radioactive atoms).  Mature nanotechnology provides such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separation capabilities.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Because mature nanotechnology is, or can easily be made,
<br>
radiation-resistant.
<br>
<p>Evolution admittedly has a large head start.  I suppose I could buy the
<br>
idea that the initial stages of nanotechnology will be more fragile than
<br>
biology, as long as we acknowledge that this is a temporary condition. 
<br>
But open-air nanotech is not exactly an early stage.
