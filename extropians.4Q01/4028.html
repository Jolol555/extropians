<p>
<em>&gt; &gt;I am disappointed that a organization like ExI, which ostensibly values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rational thought, has chosen to follow a zero-intelligence policy on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;anything. Human beings have marvellous minds that to date no machinery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;has been able to duplicate (despite our best efforts). Why are so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;authorities afraid to use them? Zero-tolerance policies substitute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;blind automatic rules for what should be the exercise of human judgment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem though, Lee, is that human judgment is prone to bias. 
</em><br>
<p>Of course it is; that's what makes it judgment.  And that's exactly
<br>
what we're doing here: making the judgment about what is valuable to
<br>
us and what isn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the list rules were to reflect that ad hominem is essentially not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good, but the list admin(s) will choose whether or not the offender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be banned, there are the ramifications of subjective bias.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely, but that's still 100 times better than leaving human
<br>
judgment out of the loop entirely.  That's what makes people do silly
<br>
things like expelling a boy scout with a hatchet in the trunk of his
<br>
car for &quot;carrying a weapon&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It has been decided by ExI's executives that ad hominem has no place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the extropians list.
</em><br>
<p>Good for them; I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That goes for everyone from folks like Anders to the newest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newbie.
</em><br>
<p>As it should,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally,  I can't envision any practical reason for an ad hominem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange, and  unless someone can make a really good case for when and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how ad hominem is productive, the rule should remain.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I agree. But it is the height of folly to suggest that we have
<br>
cleear definitions here, or that it is impossible for de jure application
<br>
of the rules to result in detriment to the list.  What about sarcasm or
<br>
other humor between off-list friends?  What about perfectly legitimate
<br>
discussions about the values, character, and actions of human beings that
<br>
happen to include examples? 
<br>
<p>All I'm saying is that (1) taking away judgment won't remove bias
<br>
anyway; (2) blind application of rules often results in injustice
<br>
worse than what the rules were meant to prevent; and (3) it is the
<br>
personal responsibility of those in authority to exercise judgment,
<br>
and take the heat for their bias if necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As it says in the List Rules, we most certainly *don't* like rules for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own sake.  But for the sake of list quality, a few guidelines are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously necessary.
</em><br>
<p>Guidelines are good.  &quot;Zero-tolerance&quot; is bad.  Always.  It is something
<br>
we, as Extropians, should fight--and we can't fight it and practice it.
<br>
