<p>Harvey, for any reasonably accurate copying to occur you will probably need
<br>
to map the brain to the synapse level (a few micron), perhaps to the protein
<br>
level (10-40 nm).  I think when its all said and done we will find that
<br>
we will be able to abstract the thoughts up to a higher (multi-neuron)
<br>
level.  At those levels the things you mention are going to be pretty
<br>
irrelevant.  I think for your argument to have merit you have to make
<br>
the case that chaotic events at the molecular level influence how we
<br>
think.  I really doubt that is the case.
<br>
<p>Think about the force required to sustain a severe concussion or
<br>
cause brain damage (e.g. Muhammed Ali) -- the hardware is pretty
<br>
robust.  Now there may be some critical paths that you can't
<br>
abstract up very much -- auditory and optical neuron functions
<br>
come to mind -- but you can replace those with hardwired devices
<br>
of a completely different nature and the individual will adapt.
<br>
We are already doing this with various types of hardware implants.
<br>
<p>I think some of the examples I've seen are pretty contrived and
<br>
a huge amount of energy is being spent on definitions and thought
<br>
experiments rather than exploring what may be some of the more likely
<br>
scenarios.  Here are 3 paths I can see.
<br>
<p>a) Outloading -- a gradual offloading of mental function onto
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;external hardware, followed by up-evolving such that our current
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain, mind and identity concepts have very little significance.
<br>
b) Inloading -- a gradual replacement of neuron function with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;designs that are much more efficient, have built-in I/O port
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;features that allow high bandwidth data sharing with equivalent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copies.  These utilize architectures like the Space Shuttle computers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(majority logic among the different instantiations).  So your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extended mind &quot;collectively&quot; creates your identity.
<br>
c) Recreation -- using the fine-grained information about the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain structure to recreate the original identity on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different hardware (or within a VR).
