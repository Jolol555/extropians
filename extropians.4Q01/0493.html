<em>&gt; Anders happened to do his survey on my birthday, so there

</em><br>
<p>Actually, I didn't count them as noise either. Congratulations,
<br>
and sorry for not congratualting yesterday - it would have
<br>
interfered with the experiment. :-)
<br>
<p>OK, to comment on the responses so far:
<br>
<p>I like Mark's suggestion for rating posts, but beside the
<br>
thread-handling problem there are also issues of people just
<br>
responding without changing the value and similar minor details.
<br>
Robert has some good points about the general problems with high
<br>
volume forums, and I think it is worth considering if we could
<br>
improve the list by some extra lists. 
<br>
<p>But these are all technical fixes, and while I like technical
<br>
fixes as much as the next promethean god-wannabee :-) I think
<br>
they will not solve the core problem. The core problem seems to
<br>
be more of a social problem: the socialising crowds out the
<br>
transhumanism, and the very open forum (and movement) while
<br>
promoting diversity also promotes lack of focus and consensus. 
<br>
<p>Michael:
<br>
<em>&gt; Agreed. This is part of the neverending &quot;Is 'extropians' a watering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole, a recruiting office, or a SIG?&quot; question. 'extropians' is my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watering hole; I have no other; I try to add value any way I can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humor, etc. has led to my finding perhaps a dozen people _really_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth knowing. Usually, I'm posting for them.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. When I was feeling the most pessimistic while counting
<br>
the posts yesterday I considered leaving the list, but realised
<br>
that it still has a positive value to me just because I have so
<br>
many friends on the list. But that if we decide that the
<br>
extropians is a suitable watering hole, we need another, more
<br>
focused forum for developing transhumanist thinking. It doesn't
<br>
have to be closed, but has to keep high standards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I find it worrying that many of the most extropian posts were re-posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from elsewhere. Jaron Lanier's post today would definitely have made it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; into my &quot;really extropian&quot; category, and he is one of our main critics!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If we don't produce any good ideas ourselves, others will do it instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Worrying?&quot; Hmm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was the guy who forwarded that. If I don't (re)post things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter, I'm not doing my job as a list member. If I don't have time or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attention, at least I bring it to the attention to people who might. I'm still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking about it, I'm just not saying anything. Conduits still add
</em><br>
<em>&gt;value.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. And I think the broad spectrum of information gathered
<br>
onto this list is one of its more valuable aspects. It is just
<br>
that it is a bit sad that it is not *us* who are the information
<br>
creators.
