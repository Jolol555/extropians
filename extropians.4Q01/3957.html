&lt;&lt;I read a recent analysis and the &quot;wild card&quot; that seems to be making the
<br>
Simons right and the Erlichs wrong is technology (driven by human ingenuity).
<br>
The geologists are figuring out how to get more of the oil out of the
<br>
ground and still aren't getting a large fraction of it.  So there is
<br>
substantial room for improvement.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, of course, but only at the right price. Please refer to our little 
<br>
discussion regarding Wired magazines' article, on the prediction that at 
<br>
27.00 per barrel, suddenly, converting methane gas to gasoline becomes 
<br>
attractive. So too, will recovering oil from tertiary wells, heavy crude, 
<br>
bituminous oil, etc.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If the plans the U.S. DOE has on the board for electricity production
<br>
get implemented over the next 10-20 years then I think the problem
<br>
is solved.  Everyone knows we have several hundred years of coal
<br>
resources and the electrical production efficiencies are slated to
<br>
jump from ~35% to &gt;80%.  Several hundred years give us plenty of
<br>
time to switch to solar power and/or fusion.  Cheap electricity lets
<br>
you switch to hydrogen as a locomotion fuel for most applications&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I agree with your enthusiasm about coal availability and utility. One concern 
<br>
is CO¹ and CO² release into the atmosphere. Can we also develop cheap 
<br>
sequestration processes for these gases? Consider that China, Russia, and 
<br>
India wish to power their countries, and now that nuclear fission has proved 
<br>
economically, questionable, have turned to coal.
<br>
<p>In 1990 a group of Dutch economists suggested that hydrogen should be the end 
<br>
result of a modern energy society. Furthermore, they decided that extracting 
<br>
hydrogen from coal as much, nearer, technically, then electrolysis, or 
<br>
biological methods, for cost effectiveness.  A later study by 2 physicists at 
<br>
Princeton University (1999)  refined the Dutch study, and deemed that natural 
<br>
gas (methane) appeared even better-simpler to break CH^4 into H².
<br>
<p>Finally:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&quot;It clearly is&quot;?  Basis for assertion please?
<br>
Take a look at 3D printers.  What is there that is so hard to grasp
<br>
about the concepts of self-replication, exponential growth and the
<br>
concept of turning matter into &quot;software&quot;? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Let us say I mis-typed myself on that one-since I am a nano-ethusiast. I was 
<br>
attempting to point out that nano as a manufacturing concept is very advanced 
<br>
and is not the 'run of the mill', and is closer to one's fantasies for a 
<br>
better world, yotta yotta.
