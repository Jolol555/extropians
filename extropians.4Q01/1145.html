<p>
Ahemmm!  I think I will speak to this question.
<br>
<p>I believe that I am a 12th generation American citizen (those on
<br>
the list who can trump that (native Americans excepted) please
<br>
feel free to do so).  Rafal, would I believe, be considered a
<br>
0th generation American.  Yet I find myself siding more with
<br>
Rafal than with Randy.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Extropian Game&quot; is *NOT* &quot;horde the wealth&quot;.  The Extropian
<br>
Game is to spin the wheel and promote complexification.  Randy's
<br>
points are ill-suited for the Extropian list unless he makes a
<br>
clear and falsifiable arugment that the admission of &quot;educated&quot;
<br>
immigrants over &quot;uneducated&quot; immigrants will clearly promote
<br>
a greater rate of complexification.
<br>
<p>Sure, there are arguments that admitting half-a-billion people
<br>
with less than a high-school education is likely to reduce the
<br>
USA to chaos and bankrupt us.  And there are arguments that
<br>
excluding people like Rafal (no offence Rafal) could be beneficial
<br>
because that would presumably make physicians scarcer, driving
<br>
up their salaries that would be invested in mutual funds that
<br>
would promote capital formation in the economy.  Lord knows,
<br>
those waves of uneducated, illiterate masses would be incapable
<br>
of such sophisticated actions that promote capitalism and
<br>
complexification.  Thus we end up in Randy's position that
<br>
allowing the immigration of people like Rafal but denying
<br>
the immigration of people with very low skill levels is
<br>
desirable.
<br>
<p>NOT!
<br>
<p>Perhaps those uneducated illiterate masses free up enough time
<br>
of the educated that they are able to devote more time to the
<br>
optimization of their investment portfolios and that serves to
<br>
increase complexification.
<br>
<p>(No slights intended -- from each according to his or her means to
<br>
each according to his or hero skills and desires).
<br>
<p>Do we measure ourselves by how much we have or by how much
<br>
we have contributed?!?  This is a fine line in the Extropian Game.
<br>
<p>First there is nobody citing peer-reviewed economic studies
<br>
that in any way justify their positions.  You are contributing
<br>
to the *NOISE* and not to the *DATA*!  I'm in the Anders camp
<br>
here -- YOUR OPINIONS COUNT FOR LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING unless
<br>
you can link them back to scientific data -- *THAT* is what
<br>
extropianism is all about.  (I'm willing to listen to speculative
<br>
hypothesis but the Subject line (ARE YOU LISTENING PEOPLE?)
<br>
should read:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPECULATIVE HYPOTHESIS: US should only allow educated immigation
<br>
<p>DATA (good) EVIDENCE (good) OPINION (bad)!  (unless you can back it up)
<br>
<p>Randy -- I *challenge* you -- how do you KNOW *they* are witches?

<p>If you can't prove the person is a witch then burn her (or him)
<br>
at your own risk (of decomplexification)!
<br>
<p>'Nough said.
<br>
<p>Assertion: New York city would work much less efficiently without
<br>
the Doorpersons of apartment buildings (nobody to recieve packages,
<br>
enhance security, facilitate the communication of messages, etc.);
<br>
Most Doorpersons are 0th or 1st generation immigrants.  It is a
<br>
stepping stone position for something better for themselves or
<br>
their children.  Eliminate immigration and the labor source to
<br>
fill these positions and the salary expenses will be driven up 
<br>
for people to fill these positions (driving up the rent or
<br>
maintenance fees of people like lawyers, doctors, brokers, etc.
<br>
who live in these buildings).  Can they afford this?  Yes.  Does
<br>
it optimize the resources available for complexification?  A highly
<br>
debatable question....
<br>
<p>This is based on my own personal experience (a valid DATA citation)
<br>
of having lived in New York City from 1974-1981.  Your experience
<br>
may differ -- if so detail it.
