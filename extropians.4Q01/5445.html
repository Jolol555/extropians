<em>&gt; OK, Mike of Borg will use his pocket nuke connected to whether his

<em>&gt; Or Benny of Borg will wire his pocket nuke to explode when people

<p>Because some creatures are too irrational to be trusted with so
<br>
much as an icepick doesn't mean that all beings are to be
<br>
forbidden what in the hands of the utterly irrational and
<br>
irresponsible is dangerous.  The assumption that no citizen
<br>
should have what every citizen cannot be entrusted with is quite
<br>
questionable.  The assumption that only citizens who have become
<br>
part of the government should have what most citizens are not to
<br>
be trusted with is also very questionable.
