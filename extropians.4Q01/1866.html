<p>The silence is deafening. I think Damien's ideas have a little merit, but
<br>
in terms of being a good viral marketing technique they require too much
<br>
work on the part of the humans. For best results he needs to spread his
<br>
book out in a more automated fashion. Secondly of course it suffers from
<br>
the &quot;how do you get them to pay&quot; problem, although if the book gets
<br>
spread wide enough and has some means of maintaining the payment link
<br>
then perhaps enough people will tip him to make him some real money. I'd
<br>
focus more on the how to market it problem first.
<br>
<p>Oddly enough, I think it may turn out to be rather hard to give away
<br>
free books. Most of the readers probably won't associate free books
<br>
with high quality, and this combined with the fact that it takes a
<br>
pretty high time commitment to read will tend to limit the audience
<br>
that is willing to take a chance on your book. It's not the same as
<br>
downloading a bunch of MP3s that you can play in the background while
<br>
you're working or in your car to sort out the good ones.
<br>
<p>I'm curious on what your impressions are of the fictionwise biz so far?
<br>
They have a half-decent website, but the prices are still way too high
<br>
IMO. Have you heard of any sites offering a subscription model? I could
<br>
see myself paying some kind of monthly fee for access to a site containing
<br>
a bunch of books being published by good authors. The books would have
<br>
to show up on the site at the same time they hit the stores or earlier,
<br>
and it would have to allow me to read a pretty high number of books
<br>
each month. You'd still have to come up with a solution to the book-
<br>
trading-on-Morpheus problem, although as I said above the trading of
<br>
free books may not turn out to be as bad as with MP3s. If the subscription
<br>
website also had members-only book recommendations and other features
<br>
that actually do a good job of helping readers find good books then
<br>
that would also tend to drive more people to paying for the subscription
<br>
I think.
