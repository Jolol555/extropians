<p>
<em>&gt; In a war, ALL information about a) the enemy, and b) your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities, operations, methods, and assets, is to be regarded as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence information. You may choose to release some of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, but such decisions should be based entirely on the basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its utility in the propaganda war versus the cost of letting the enemy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that information, as they would once it is publicly published.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, for example, it is detailed at trial what methods were used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover evidence about the planning, preparation, logistics, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operations of terrorist attacks, the public record of this evidence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then available for the al Qaeda or any other terrorist network to use to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out ways to avoid evidentiary discovery in the future.
</em><br>
<p>That's a pretty good argument.  I'll have to think about some way to
<br>
maintain the accused's right to public scrutiny of his trial with
<br>
national security objectives that seem, at least as presented here,
<br>
legitimate.  Perhaps in such extraordinary cases, certain portions
<br>
of a trial could be accessible to a limited oversight group who are
<br>
required to sign non-disclosures and meet security clearance tests.
<br>
Or maybe a judge should have discretion to hear evidence in private,
<br>
and only if he judges that it is both relevant, reliable, and a
<br>
security risk, then he can allow the jury (who is also under non-
<br>
disclosure) to hear it in camera in front of designated witnesses.
<br>
<p>It is a tricky issue.  I acknowledge that this concern in valid,
<br>
but star chambers are all too easy to create, and I fear that allowing
<br>
even this exception will lead to abuse if not checked, the way Nixon
<br>
abused &quot;national security&quot; classification to avoid subpoenas for his
<br>
personal records.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can live your own life by your standards, so I can live my life by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mine. When you try to force me to live by your standards, I sure as hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am going to force you to live by your own standards. The one sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense against rape is to make the rapist enjoy the experience even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than you do.
</em><br>
<p>I think we're talking past each other here.  Lethal force in self-
<br>
defense is one of _my_ standards; I employ it not because the other
<br>
guy thinks force is OK, but because _I_ think force is OK in that
<br>
situation, whether he thinks so or not.  Likewise, I find Hiroshima
<br>
justified not because Japan ignored the Geneva conventions, but
<br>
because I find the Geneva conventions themselves stupid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; transparency, not whatever particulars some document mentions.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particulars can change with the circumstances, but the one, and only,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; absolute inviolable principle is that trials be PUBLIC.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even at the cost of your own life?
</em><br>
<p>I fear it's all too easy to use &quot;it's a life-and-death matter&quot; or
<br>
&quot;we're at war&quot; t justify relaxing our principles.  Let's put it this
<br>
way: if I thought that testifying against a criminal in open court
<br>
might pose some risk to my safety, I might still choose to do it if
<br>
I thought the benefit was sufficient.  If I knew with near certainty
<br>
that it would cost my life to testify _and_ that it would cost my
<br>
life for the criminal to go free, I might take pre-emptive action
<br>
against the criminal and face my own trial for my actions--and I
<br>
would hope that trial were public.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So you don't mind kangaroo court trials, so long as they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held in public?
</em><br>
<p>Publicity is my greatest protection from proceedings becoming
<br>
kangaroo courts.
