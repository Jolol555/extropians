<p>The most likely hell I can think of is economic depression, social upheaval,
<br>
and scattered acts of terrorism including bioterrorism. More on that in an
<br>
upcoming post.
<br>
<p>However, I think that obscure quiet locations with a sufficient local
<br>
resource base and with no particular strategic value are the best *sort*
<br>
of place to look for in whatever part of the country one is in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My personal opinion is that if this sort of thing is set up, we should
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things paid for by donations by those who want in. It might be good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to actually buy some plots of land in areas where land is cheap (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lease it, which is even cheaper). In northern Maine, for example, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can buy lots of land for under $100/acre that is wooded with plenty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game and water and is clearable for farming. You can lease land from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lumber companies for not much more than the cost of state property taxes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (each lease usually covers 5 acres and there are a limited number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offered per unorganized township). I'm sure similar situations exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elsewhere in the country.
</em><br>
<p>All excellent points, and I like the term you coined. Exclaves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The advantage of having several is that it allows those who wind up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited transportation to reach the closest E-Exclave rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trucking across a continent that may be in ghu what knows condition.
</em><br>
<p>Not to mention that it would lead to multiple strategies being tried
<br>
instead of putting all eggs in one basket. That's what I meant by
<br>
distributed and diverse.
