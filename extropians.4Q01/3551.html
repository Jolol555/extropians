From: &quot;Mike Lorrey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20&quot;Cloning%20Breakthrough&quot;%20not%20one&In-Reply-To=&lt;002901c17904$fd5c4fc0$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is disengenuous to expand the definition of ad hominem to attacks on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an entire profession, for there are many circumstances that anyone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of where such attacks are entirely warranted and are supported by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the facts. For example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I have never, absolutely never, heard a politician say anything that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not either a) a lie, or b) bloody obvious.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I don't see your point. The fallacy of an ad hominem argument is not an
<br>
injunction against making personal attacks per se. The following is a good
<br>
argument which is also a personal attack:
<br>
All Nazi leaders are assholes.
<br>
Hilter was a Nazi leader.
<br>
Therefore, Hitler is an asshole.
<br>
<p><p>The following is an ad hominem argument
<br>
<p>Hitler is a jerk
<br>
Hitler says 170,141,183,460.469,231,731,687,303,715,884,727 is a prime
<br>
number.
<br>
Therefore, it is not a prime number.
<br>
<p>The fact that Hitler is a jerk is irrevelant to the question of whether this
<br>
is a prime number or not.
<br>
<p>Now compare this to what John said. His claim is that the level of virtue of
<br>
medical ethicists some how is supposed to be support for the claim that what
<br>
they say is either bloody obvious or false. Generally I would say that
<br>
John's claim is irrelevant (and thus an ad hominem) because good people can
<br>
write bad ethical theory and bad people can write good ethical theory. If
<br>
one thinks otherwise then the burden of proof is on them, given that they
<br>
are making the personal attack. Specifically, we are talking about medical
<br>
ethicists. Their speciality is (roughly) about the duties and obligation
<br>
between patients and caregivers. Why can't they be experts about these
<br>
matters at the office and yet at home be a bunch of puppy-kickking bastards?
<br>
In any event, the point is not that it is impossible to provide evidence
<br>
that connects the character of medical ethicists to John's claim about what
<br>
they say, but that no evidence _was_ provided. Think how my example of an ad
<br>
hominem argument my be saved: if I could add a premise (like some wishful
<br>
Platonist) which demonstrates only good people (nonjerks) have accessed to
<br>
higher mathematical truths like prime numbers. Since John did not provide
<br>
such a bridge premise his argument was ad hominem.
