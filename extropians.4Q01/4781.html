</em><br>
<p>As a veteran, I'd have to disagree that landmines are intrinsically
<br>
'inhumane'. They certainly can be used in inhumane ways, no doubt, but
<br>
they are also highly useful tools in many circumstances. 
<br>
<p>I highly doubt that the people of South Korea, for example, think the
<br>
millions of landmines in the DMZ are 'inhumane'. Imagine if they were
<br>
not there, the whole penninsula would have long been overrun by the
<br>
North and their Chinese allies, and the whole penninsula would be
<br>
undeveloped and suffering from the famine that is currently confined to
<br>
the North. Far more would suffer and die from that famine in the South,
<br>
and today only the occasional NKA infiltrator is killed in the DMZ.
<br>
<p>Similarly, US forces have historically entered conflict outnumbered by
<br>
their opponents. Their only advantage is the use of technology. As a
<br>
tactic of combat, the use of landmines to ambush and pin down a larger
<br>
opposing force in order to target it with artillery from miles away is a
<br>
seminal one that US forces perfected in Vietnam. Use of landmines to
<br>
protect a forward operating base (i.e. the famed &quot;A-team&quot; bases) against
<br>
being overrun by superior opposing numbers is also a highly important
<br>
defense tool.
<br>
<p>The problem, of course, is that most landmines do not distinguish
<br>
between combatant and non-combatant, and most are simply abandoned by
<br>
those that install them. Furthermore, guerrilla insurgents will
<br>
typically dig up mines and move them to locations where they are
<br>
guaranteed to be triggered by non-combatants, and some operations
<br>
(committed by both the East and the West) will scatter such mines
<br>
haphazardly over an area (as the Soviets did in Afghanistan, the Cubans
<br>
did in Angola, and the US did in Haiphong and Managua Harbors).
<br>
<p>Landmines should not be disbursed from aircraft, for starters. They
<br>
should be built to distinguish between combatant and non-combatant via
<br>
metal detection, etc., and should be programmed to either go off or
<br>
deactivate after a given time period, or upon being triggered by an
<br>
encoded radio signal. Using measures like this would go a long way to
<br>
ensuring that mines are used in strictly military fashion.
<br>
<p>As for the damage of a landmine on a combatant, as opposed to other
<br>
forms of battle field attack, I'd much rather lose a foot to a landmine
<br>
than getting a bullet through the spine. Which do you think is more
<br>
humane?
