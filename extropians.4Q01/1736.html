<em>&gt;     &gt; Hi John, I think you're the ignorant one in this case. I've read several

<em>&gt; Yes, you're quite right, I stand corrected. There actually was some talk about building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a pipeline, though I find the idea incredible in such a geography. I'd still be willing to bet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a modest sum that such a thing will never get built, but I suppose stranger things have

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, well it makes perfect sense to me- you've got a stash of oil there
<br>
perhaps bigger than is under Saudi Arabia, and you've got those young
<br>
needy former Soviet republics that desperately want cash. Here's another
<br>
article about it I just got today. I don't believe this is the reason
<br>
we are at war, but it is still interesting.

<em>&gt;Dave - I thought you and the IPers might enjoy a current Pakistani 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perspective on America's interests and goals beyond halting terrorism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;based in Afghanistan.  It certainly might explain why Cheney is remaining 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invisible.

<em>&gt;Oil, Afghanistan and America's pipe dream
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By George Monbiot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;LONDON: &quot;Is there any man, is there any woman, let me say any child here,&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Woodrow Wilson asked a year after the First World War ended, &quot;that does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not know that the seed of war in the modern world is industrial and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commercial rivalry?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In 1919, as US citizens watched a shredded Europe scraping up its own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remains, the answer may well have been no. But the lessons of war never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last for long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The invasion of Afghanistan is certainly a campaign against terrorism, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it may also be a late colonial adventure. British ministers have warned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;British members of parliament (MPs) that opposing the war is the moral 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equivalent of appeasing Hitler, but in some respects our moral choices are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;closer to those of 1956 than those of 1938. Afghanistan is as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indispensable to the regional control and transport of oil in central Asia 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as Egypt was in the Middle East.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan has some oil and gas of its own, but not enough to qualify as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a major strategic concern. Its northern neighbours, by contrast, contain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reserves which could be critical to future global supply. In 1998, Dick 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cheney, now US vice-president but then chief executive of a major oil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;services company, remarked: &quot;I cannot think of a time when we have had a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Caspian.&quot; But the oil and gas there is worthless until it is moved. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only route which makes both political and economic sense is through 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
