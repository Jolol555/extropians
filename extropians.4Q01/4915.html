<p><p><p>Shermer's Last Law
<br>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial intelligence is indistinguishable 
<br>
from God 
<br>
&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.sciam.com/2002/0102issue/#author">http://www.sciam.com/2002/0102issue/#author</a>&quot;&gt;By MICHAEL SHERMER&lt;/A&gt;...........
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As scientist extraordinaire and author of an empire of science-fiction 
<br>
books, Arthur C. Clarke is one of the farthest-seeing visionaries of our 
<br>
time. His pithy quotations tug harder than those of most futurists on our 
<br>
collective psyches for their insights into humanity and our unique place in 
<br>
the cosmos. And none do so more than his famous Third Law: &quot;Any sufficiently 
<br>
advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot;
<br>
<p>This observation stimulated me to think about the impact the discovery of an 
<br>
extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) would have on science and religion. To 
<br>
that end, I would like to immodestly propose Shermer's Last Law (I don't 
<br>
believe in naming laws after oneself, so as the good book says, the last 
<br>
shall be first and the first shall be last): &quot;Any sufficiently advanced ETI 
<br>
is indistinguishable from God.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Because of science, our world has changed more in the past century than in 
<br>
the previous 100 centuries. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
God is typically described by Western religions as omniscient and omnipotent. 
<br>
Because we are far from possessing these traits, how can we possibly 
<br>
distinguish a God who has them absolutely from an ETI who merely has them 
<br>
copiously relative to us? We can't. But if God were only relatively more 
<br>
knowing and powerful than we are, then by definition the deity would be an 
<br>
ETI! 
<br>
<p>Consider that biological evolution operates at a snail's pace compared with 
<br>
technological evolution (the former is Darwinian and requires generations of 
<br>
differential reproductive success; the latter is Lamarckian and can be 
<br>
accomplished within a single generation). Then, too, the cosmos is very big 
<br>
and very empty. Voyager 1, our most distant spacecraft, hurtling along at 
<br>
more than 38,000 miles per hour, will not reach the distance of even our 
<br>
sun's nearest neighbor, the Alpha Centauri system (which it is not headed 
<br>
toward), for more than 75,000 years. 
<br>
<p>Ergo, the probability that an ETI only slightly more advanced than we are 
<br>
will make contact is virtually nil. If we ever do find an ETI, it will be as 
<br>
though a million-year-old Homo erectus were dropped into the 21st century, 
<br>
given a computer and cell phone and instructed to communicate with us. The 
<br>
ETI would be to us as we would be to this early hominid--godlike. 
<br>
<p>Because of science and technology, our world has changed more in the past 
<br>
century than in the previous 100 centuries. It took 10,000 years to get from 
<br>
the dawn of civilization to the airplane but just 66 years to get from 
<br>
powered flight to a lunar landing. 
<br>
<p>Moore's Law of computer power doubling every 18 months or so is now 
<br>
approaching a year. Ray Kurzweil, in his book The Age of Spiritual Machines, 
<br>
calculates that there have been 32 doublings since World War II and that the 
<br>
singularity point--the point at which total computational power will rise to 
<br>
levels so far beyond anything that we can imagine that it will appear nearly 
<br>
infinite and thus be indistinguishable from omniscience--may be upon us as 
<br>
early as 2050. 
<br>
<p>When that happens, the decade that follows will put the 100,000 years before 
<br>
it to shame. Extrapolate out about a million years (just a blink on an 
<br>
evolutionary timescale and therefore a realistic estimate of how far advanced 
<br>
ETIs will be), and we get a gut-wrenching, mind-warping feel for how godlike 
<br>
these creatures would seem. In Clarke's 1953 novel, called Childhood's End, 
<br>
humanity reaches something like a singularity and must then make the 
<br>
transition to a higher state of consciousness. One character early in the 
<br>
story opines that &quot;science can destroy religion by ignoring it as well as by 
<br>
disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am aware, the 
<br>
nonexistence of Zeus or Thor, but they have few followers now.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Although science has not even remotely destroyed religion, Shermer's Last Law 
<br>
predicts that the relation between the two will be profoundly affected by 
<br>
contact with an ETI. To find out how, we must follow Clarke's Second Law: 
<br>
&quot;The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a 
<br>
little way past them into the impossible.&quot; Ad astra!
