author must finnaly realise that delay of publication makes his
<br>
scientific observations out of date.

<p><p><em>&gt; <a href="http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7322/1192/a">http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7322/1192/a</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oxford University Press, £19.99, pp 368
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ISBN 0 19 514509 7
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1984 Professor Andreasen published a book called The Broken Brain: The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Biological Revolution in Psychiatry. This influenced many latter day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychiatrists (myself included). Now Andreasen has produced a work in
</em><br>
which
<br>
<em>&gt; she attempts to assay the field of contemporary psychiatric research, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychiatry enters the 21st century, sandwiched between two major
</em><br>
technological
<br>
<em>&gt; developments: the sequencing of the human genome and the use of
</em><br>
neuroimaging
<br>
<em>&gt; to examine the structure and function of the living brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there a need for such a work? Are we not already deluged by brain
</em><br>
books?
<br>
<em>&gt; Certainly, if there were a need then Andreasen would be a suitable guide.
</em><br>
She
<br>
<em>&gt; is editor of the American Journal of Psychiatry, has contributed to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; composition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; made significant contributions to the field of schizophrenia research, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studied the relationship between creativity and mental illness
</em><br>
scientifically,
<br>
<em>&gt; and has also published early work on post-traumatic stress disorder
</em><br>
(before it
<br>
<em>&gt; acquired that name). So, on all levels she is amply qualified. But do we
</em><br>
need
<br>
<em>&gt; another book?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This book differs from others in that it is written by someone who has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conducted original research, while continuing to treat patients. Andreasen
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; write scientifically, while also addressing the concerns of lay people.
</em><br>
Many
<br>
<em>&gt; of the chapters begin with case vignettes (some of them very moving) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout Andreasen see-saws between cogent descriptions of scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts and reference points that all will understanda film that deals
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; schizophrenia, a novel whose character was depressed, and so on. This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detailed text, not a coffee table book. It explains the principles of the
</em><br>
new
<br>
<em>&gt; genetics, the anatomy of neurotransmitter systems, and the methodology of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain scanning. In four chapters devoted to diseases, Andreasen explains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schizophrenia, mood disorders, dementia, and anxiety. She does not shirk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical dilemmas and possesses a humane voice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where are the weaknesses? As with any book that attempts to cover a broad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field, some infelicities occur. These are probably slips of the pen: the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putamen lies lateral and not medial to the globus pallidus (p 73); reduced
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; elevated serotonergic tone is associated with impulsivity and suicide (p
</em><br>
311);
<br>
<em>&gt; and in the index, the name of one British psychiatrist is left floating,
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; no page attribution (obsessives will find Johnstone, Eve, on p 143).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elsewhere, the balance of Andreasen's expertise is clearly present in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schizophrenia chapter, while that on dementia lacks the same degree of
</em><br>
detail.
<br>
<em>&gt; However, these are minor points. I think a lay reader, a medical student,
</em><br>
or a
<br>
<em>&gt; generalist who wishes to update on current psychiatry will find much that
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; useful and inspiring in Brave New Brain.

<em>&gt; We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces

superstition.
