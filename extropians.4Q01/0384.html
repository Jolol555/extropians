<em>&gt;From the Virus List
</em><br>
<p>A Cross Post written by Dana Blankenhorn, a very Virian thinker.
<br>
(I have snipped a little unrelated material, and the original article was 
<br>
chock full of links which can be found at www.a-clue.com)
<br>
<p>What's the use of stories that aren't even true?&quot;
<br>
<p>This is the question Haroun Khalifa asks his father, Rashid, the &quot;Shah of 
<br>
Blah,&quot; in Salman Rushdie's masterful fairy tale, &quot;Haroun and the Sea of 
<br>
Stories.&quot;
<br>
<p>While my life has been journalism, I do not pretend that what you read in 
<br>
a-clue.com is truly that. I may base my ramblings and imaginings on facts, 
<br>
on real stories ripped from the headlines, but they are, in the end, just 
<br>
musings, proposals, dreams - stories, in other words.
<br>
<p>Every company, every country, and every religion starts with a story. Every 
<br>
life tells a story. The Internet is where all these stories, for the first 
<br>
time in the world's history, have the opportunity to come together. It is 
<br>
Kahani, the moon where Rushdie's story takes place. This medium is truly fed 
<br>
by the ocean of the streams of story.
<br>
<p>What we feel today, what we will continue to feel for years to come, is 
<br>
similar to what Rushdie has felt since the Iranian Mullahs declared a fatwa 
<br>
(statement) of blasphemy and a death sentence upon him for his &quot;The Satanic 
<br>
Verses.&quot; &quot;Haroun&quot; was the first product of his pen after the death sentence. 
<br>
Rushdie is currently, as I understand it, a resident of New York City.
<br>
<p>Rushdie's Kahani is divided between light Guppees and dark Chupwalas, but 
<br>
these are not his heroes or villains. Both are necessary for stories to 
<br>
work. His villain is Khattam-Shud, the final end, the closed heart and mind 
<br>
which poisons the ocean and sucks the life from light and dark alike.
<br>
<p>And the solution to Khattam-Shud isn't a great battle, but simply exposing 
<br>
his nature, as is done by Haroun in the fable and his father Rashid the next 
<br>
day in telling his son's story before a huge crowd. That's the use of 
<br>
stories that aren't even true.
<br>
<p>Osama bin Laden and those who have declared war on us are beyond faith, 
<br>
hope, or life. They are Khattam-Shud, the end. This is what they gave the 
<br>
World Trade Center. This is what they seek to give to all of us.
<br>
<p>We of the Internet, no matter what our opinions may be, are all currents in 
<br>
the ocean of the streams of story. We are Kahani, whether or not our stories 
<br>
are true. This medium is life, it is a glorious adventure, it can be 
<br>
anything you wish it to be.
<br>
<p>But it won't be defended by our becoming as intolerant or judgmental as our 
<br>
enemies. The war won't be won by Guppees fighting Chupwalas. It can only be 
<br>
won by exposing Khattam-Shud so that all might reject him, starting of 
<br>
course with the people of Afghanistan and extending to all the world's 
<br>
Muslims. If dead he can be a martyr. He can only be truly gone when he's 
<br>
universally recognized for what he is, a blasphemer.
<br>
<p>My point for you today is it won't end there. The war against Khattam-Shud 
<br>
doesn't end. It is the never-ending battle against all all absolutes that 
<br>
declare war against anyone with other stories to tell, and who practice 
<br>
their intolerance in action, not just word.
<br>
<p>Many think they see the ingredients of Khattam-Shud in front of them. They 
<br>
see it on thousands of Web sites, in hundreds of e-mail lists, on every U.S. 
<br>
talk radio station. Some hear it spoken from pulpits. But Rushdie teaches 
<br>
that it's fine and good for such foolish talk to be written and read, spoken 
<br>
and heard. It's just Chupwalas spreading darkness, and even Guppees are 
<br>
attracted to such black-and-white, simplistic stuff.
<br>
<p>It's just when that darkness decides to fill a Ryder truck with fertilizer 
<br>
and diesel fuel, then explode it next to a federal building, that it becomes 
<br>
Khattam-Shud. It's when that darkness chooses to hatch a plot to hijack 
<br>
planes and fly them into buildings that it becomes Khattam-Shud.
<br>
<p>No thought, no matter how intolerable to you, or abhorrent, should be beyond 
<br>
the power of the Internet to deliver. It's actions, or plans of action 
<br>
leading to death, that must be exposed to the light. That's an important 
<br>
difference to understand as the Internet goes forward, as this Kahani spins 
<br>
along.
<br>
<p>The ultimate darkness lies in closing our eyes and ears, our hearts and 
<br>
minds, to any currents in the oceans of the streams of story. There's much 
<br>
more to this medium than meets the Blinking Eye.
<br>
<p>Make No More Enemies Than Necessary
<br>
<p>I haven't read Clausewitz or Sun Tzu but I strongly suspect that, if either 
<br>
were alive today, they would be recommending that we limit the field of our 
<br>
enemies.
<br>
<p>While the military response to the September 11 attacks has been minimal so 
<br>
far, the legal attacks on others have been severe, and the propaganda 
<br>
attacks on the enemy almost non-existent. The statements of the In Defense 
<br>
of Freedom page  should be self-evident, beyond debate. Yet the Bush 
<br>
Administration is insisting on permanent reductions in civil liberties, and 
<br>
branding opponents (like those who support the In Defense of Freedom page) 
<br>
as &quot;soft on terrorism.&quot; . The word for this, for those who remember their 
<br>
U.S. history, is McCarthyism.
<br>
<p>It's true that America has its own home-grown nut cases (we recently 
<br>
executed one ) and may yet execute a second) and there are others like 
<br>
McVeigh out there . But trying to eliminate encryption, or pretending that 
<br>
U.S. law enforcement &quot;wars&quot; against the Mafia or drugs have been won (and 
<br>
are thus the model for what we should do now) are, quite simply, less than 
<br>
helpful.
<br>
<p>The coalition against Bin Laden is already breaking down as Israelis and 
<br>
Arabs wrap the conflict inside their own agendas. It is foolish to add 
<br>
hackers or civil libertarians in this country to that growing list of 
<br>
enemies. Instead of arguing among ourselves, we should be funding and 
<br>
expanding the view that the Taliban are non-Islamic and non-Afghan, and 
<br>
making the case against the perpetrators in the worldwide courts of public 
<br>
opinion.
