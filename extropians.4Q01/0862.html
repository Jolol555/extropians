<em>&gt; Subject: RE: Posthuman Politics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, it has to happen sooner rather than later ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human-beens are proving themselves unfit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to run the planet, and we POSTHUMANS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need to organise politically in order to push
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forward our radical futurist agenda.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, but I won't dare to call myself post-humans yet (especially not
</em><br>
at this primitive level of technology).
<br>
<p>Then when (if ever)? There is a strong tendency
<br>
for us to become what we believe we are. Being
<br>
post- (after) humans is the inevitable and only
<br>
possible next step ... bar oblivion of the species.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As an evolutionist rather than a revolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophy I think it is consistent to work within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the current democratic political framework and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contend ELECTIONS for political power and as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a platform for spreading our message. Why not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't wish to argue whether a progressive verses revolutionary tactic
</em><br>
would work better, but bear in mind that in the past human
<br>
<em>&gt; history (and even in the history of evolution) events do happen that have
</em><br>
a more revolutionary nature than a progressive one,
<br>
<em>&gt; bringing in an era of great change.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe. Maybe proactive evolution is &quot;revolution.&quot;
<br>
Maybe it is the difference between evolution by
<br>
radical mutation rather than by gradual cross-fertilisation?
<br>
Both methods happen for sure.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I won't waste my time attempting to convince the masses of the
</em><br>
benefits of Extropian lifestyles, because I think we would achieve
<br>
relatively little with this. One would have to content with many irrelevant
<br>
factors and tasks even if one gets
<br>
elected, and the process by no means permit one to achieve election easily.
<br>
<p>Absolutely I respect your personal choice. It will
<br>
probably be a lot of hassle with no immediate payback.
<br>
But it will give me greater access to media plus a way to
<br>
get radical futurist views a more mainstream airing.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To convince the masses would prove difficult too. We already saw what
</em><br>
happened to some farmers planting GM foods or to some doctors performing
<br>
abortions. Apparently, public opinion of a close minded nature has high
<br>
resilience to change.
<br>
<p>Yeh, not everyone is ready to evolve straight away.
<br>
But if it will take time, all the more reason to start now!
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suggest again (though I know it would probably fall on deaf ears) that
</em><br>
we sould concentrate on building a colony and creating the technologies to
<br>
bring Transhuman living into our lives, while placing a lower priority on
<br>
PR. When we can show others how the actual
<br>
<em>&gt; implemention of a Transhuman lifestyle looks like, we do not need so many
</em><br>
words to convince others. Rather than thinking of helping
<br>
<em>&gt; others, we ought to consider what we ourselves had done and can do, to
</em><br>
ensure our success so that at least we ourselves can succeed.
<br>
<p>Sure, go ahead and set up a Post/ Transhuman show-house.
<br>
This sounds a good idea, but the danger is of becoming
<br>
introverted and just preaching to the converted (or arguing
<br>
amongst ourselves). I would like to visit your colony.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I intend to stand for UK parliament in central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; London where I am living, and encourage others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to stand on a POSTHUMAN ticket in their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; localities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good luck to you. I hope you will prove me wrong and succeed in convincing
</em><br>
enough people to make a difference.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Thanks for that. I have some responses that convince
<br>
me that I won't be the only candidate ..... others can
<br>
promote their own individual visions in elections in
<br>
their own localities and have already indicated that they will!
