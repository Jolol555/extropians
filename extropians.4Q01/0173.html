<p><em>&gt; One of the best ways to describe Sufism is to describe what it's *not*:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not a sect, these people are not bound by religious dogma, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they use no regular place of worship. They have no sacred city, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monastic organization, no religious instruments, no sacred book. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't like even being given a name (&quot;Sufi&quot;), which is more like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nickname to them, and prefer to refer to themselves as &quot;people like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us&quot; or &quot;we friends&quot;. (They recognize one another by certain natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gifs, habits, qualities of thought.) Sufism is only known by means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself. The function of Sufism is to be a 'nutrient' for society, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to then transmute and disappear, leaving _alterred_ traces only.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Sufis are at home in all religions because they believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sufism is the secret teaching within all religions. To them, Islam is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 'shell' of Sufism as equally as other religions are a 'shell' of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sufism. However, the Sufi thought has an eastern flavor because Islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protected it for a long time. Sufism's origin is not known, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought to have existed in B.C. times. The largest impact of Sufism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though, was made between the eighth and eighteenth centuries.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a very westernized form of Sufism, adapted in the same
<br>
way as Buddhism has been adapted in the west to fit in.  Maybe one could
<br>
say that Sufism relates to Islam in the same way Zen relates to
<br>
Buddhism. But the Zen one tends to encounter in the west is a highly
<br>
westernized form, and gives a very different view from what is practiced
<br>
by actual Japanese roshis.  
<br>
<p>I have the impression that the sufi you met had a view of Sufism that is
<br>
quite different from what historians of religion tend to take (which is
<br>
quite common when you discuss history with people of a certain religion;
<br>
the view from the inside is often very different from the one from the
<br>
outside). While there are definitely some quite non-Islamic influences
<br>
and has likely been plenty of cross-fertilisation with similar mystic
<br>
schools based in other religions, Sufism is definitely linked with
<br>
Islam.
