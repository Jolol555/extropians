Down With Democracy by Hans-Hermann Hoppe
<br>
from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html</a>
<br>
<p>Imagine a world government, democratically elected according to the
<br>
principle of one-man-one-vote on a world wide scale. What would the probable
<br>
outcome of an election be? Most likely, we would get a Chinese-Indian
<br>
coalition government. And what would this government most likely decide to
<br>
do in order to satisfy its supporters and be reelected? The government would
<br>
probably find that the so-called Western world had far too much wealth and
<br>
the rest of the world, in particular China and India, had far too little,
<br>
and hence, that a systematic wealth and income redistribution would be
<br>
called for. Or imagine, for your own country, that the right to vote were
<br>
expanded to seven year olds. While the government would not likely be made
<br>
up of children, its policies would most definitely reflect the 'legitimate
<br>
concerns' of children to have 'adaequate' and 'equal' access to 'free'
<br>
hamburgers, lemonade, and videos.
<br>
<p>In light of these 'thought experiments', is there any doubt about the
<br>
consequences which resulted from the process of democratization that began
<br>
in Europe and the U.S. in the second half of the nineteenth century and has
<br>
come to fruition since the end of World War I? The successive expansion of
<br>
the franchise and finally the establishment of universal adult suffrage did
<br>
within each country what a world democracy would do for the entire globe: it
<br>
set in motion a seemingly permanent tendency toward wealth and income
<br>
redistribution.
<br>
<p>One-man-one-vote combined with 'free entry' into government - democracy -
<br>
implies that every person and his personal property comes within reach of -
<br>
and is up for grabs by - everyone else. A 'tragedy of the commons' is
<br>
created. It can be expected that majorities of 'have-nots' will relentlessly
<br>
try to enrich themselves at the expense of minorities of 'haves'. This is
<br>
not to say that there will be only one class of have-nots and one class of
<br>
haves, and that the redistribution will be uniformly one from the rich onto
<br>
the poor. To the contrary. While the redistribution from rich to poor will
<br>
always play a prominent role everywhere, it would be a sociological blunder
<br>
to assume that it will be the sole or even the predominant form of
<br>
redistribution. After all, the 'permanently' rich and the 'permanently' poor
<br>
are usually rich or poor for a reason. The rich are characteristically
<br>
bright and industrious, and the poor typically dull, lazy, or both. It is
<br>
not very likely that dullards, even if they make up a majority, will
<br>
systematically outsmart and enrich themselves at the expense of a minority
<br>
of bright and energetic individuals. Rather, most redistribution will take
<br>
place within the group of the 'non-poor', and frequently it will actually be
<br>
the better-off who succeed in having themselves subsidized by the worse-off.
<br>
Just think of the almost universal practice of offering a 'free' university
<br>
education, whereby the working class, whose children rarely attend
<br>
universities, is made to pay for the education of middle-class children!
<br>
Moreover, it can be expected that there will be many competing groups and
<br>
coalitions trying to gain at the expense of others. There will be various
<br>
changing criteria defining what it is that makes one person a 'have'
<br>
(deserving to be looted) and another a 'have-not' (deserving to receive the
<br>
loot). At the same time, individuals will be members of a multitude of
<br>
groups of 'haves' and/or 'have-nots', losing on account of one of their
<br>
characteristic and gaining on account of another, with some individuals
<br>
ending up net-losers and others net-winners of redistribution.
<br>
<p>The recognition of democracy as a machinery of popular wealth and income
<br>
redistribution, then, in conjunction with one of the most fundamental
<br>
principles in all of economics - that one will end up getting more of
<br>
whatever it is that is being subsidized - provides the key to an
<br>
understanding of the present age.
<br>
<p>All redistribution, regardless of the criterion on which it is based,
<br>
involves 'taking' from the original owners and/or producers (the 'havers' of
<br>
something) and 'giving' to non-owners and non-producers (the 'non-havers' of
<br>
something). The incentive to be an original owner or producer of the thing
<br>
in question is reduced, and the incentive to be a non-owner and non-producer
<br>
is raised. Accordingly, as a result of subsidizing individuals because they
<br>
are poor, there will be more poverty. In subsidizing people because they are
<br>
unemployed, more unemployment will be created. Supporting single mothers out
<br>
of tax funds will lead to an increase in single motherhood, 'illegitimacy',
<br>
and divorce. In outlawing child labor, income is transfered from families
<br>
with children to childless persons (as a result of the legal restriction on
<br>
the supply of labor, wage rates will rise). Accordingly, the birthrate will
<br>
fall. On the other hand, by subsidizing the education of children, the
<br>
opposite effect is created. Income is transfered from the childless and
<br>
those with few children to those with many children. As a result the
<br>
birthrate will increase. Yet then the value of children will again fall, and
<br>
birthrates will decline as a result of the so-called Social Security System,
<br>
for in subsidizing retirees (the old) out of taxes imposed on current income
<br>
earners (the young), the institution of a family - the intergenerational
<br>
bond between parents, grandparents, and children - is systematically
<br>
weakened. The old need no longer rely on the assistance of their children if
<br>
they have made no provision for their own old age, and the young (with
<br>
typically less accumulated wealth) must support the old (with typically more
<br>
accumulated wealth) rather than the other way around, as is typical within
<br>
families. Parents' wish for children, and children's wish for parents will
<br>
decline, family breakups and dysfunctional families will increase, and
<br>
provisionary action - saving and capital formation - will fall, while
<br>
consumption rises.
<br>
<p>In subsidizing the malingerers, the neurotics, the careless, the alcoholics,
<br>
the drug addicts, the Aids-infected, and the physically and mentally
<br>
'challenged' through insurance regulation and compulsory health insurance,
<br>
there will be more illness, malingering, neuroticism, carelessness,
<br>
alcoholism, drug addiction, Aids infection, and physical and mental
<br>
retardation. By forcing non-criminals, including the victims of crime, to
<br>
pay for the imprisonment of criminals (rather than making criminals
<br>
compensate their victims and pay the full cost of their own apprehension and
<br>
incarceration), crime will increase. By forcing businessmen, through
<br>
'affirmative action' ('non-discrimination') programs, to employ more women,
<br>
homosexuals, blacks, or other 'minorities' than they would like to, there
<br>
will be more employed minorities, and fewer employers and fewer male,
<br>
heterosexual, and white employment. By compelling private land owners to
<br>
subsidize ('protect') 'endangered species' residing on their land through
<br>
environmental legislation, there will be more and better-off animals, and
<br>
fewer and worse-off humans.
<br>
<p>Most importantly, by compelling private property owners and/or market income
<br>
earners (producers) to subsidize 'politicians', 'political parties', and
<br>
'civil servants' (politicians and government employees do not pay taxes but
<br>
are paid out of taxes), there will be less wealth formation, fewer producers
<br>
and less productivity, and ever more waste, 'parasites' and parasitism.
<br>
<p>Businessmen (capitalists) and their employees cannot earn an income unless
<br>
they produce goods or services which are sold in markets. The buyers'
<br>
purchases are voluntary. By buying a good or service, the buyers (consumers)
<br>
demonstrate that they prefer this good or service over the sum of money that
<br>
they must surrender in order to acquire it. In contrast, politicians,
<br>
parties, and civil servants produce nothing which is sold in markets. No one
<br>
buys government 'goods' or 'services'. They are produced, and costs are
<br>
incurred to produce them, but they are not sold and bought. On the one hand,
<br>
this implies that it is impossible to determine their value and find out
<br>
whether or not this value justifies their costs. Because no one buys them,
<br>
no one actually demonstrates that he considers government goods and services
<br>
worth their costs, and indeed, whether or not anyone attaches any value to
<br>
them at all. From the viewpoint of economic theory, it is thus entirely
<br>
illegitimate to assume, as is always done in national income accounting,
<br>
that government goods and services are worth what it costs to produce them,
<br>
and then to simply add this value to that of the 'normal', privately
<br>
produced (bought and sold) goods and services to arrive at gross domestic
<br>
(or national) product, for instance. It might as well be assumed that
<br>
government goods and services are worth nothing, or even that they are not
<br>
&quot;goods&quot; at all but &quot;bads&quot;; hence, that the cost of politicians and the
<br>
entire civil service should be subtracted from the total value of privately
<br>
produced goods and services. Indeed, to assume this would be far more
<br>
justified. For on the other hand, as to its practical implications, the
<br>
subsidizing of politicians and civil servants amounts to a subsidy to
<br>
'produce' with little or no regard for the well-being of one's alleged
<br>
consumers, and with much or sole regard instead for the well-being of the
<br>
'producers', i.e., the politicians and civil servants. Their salaries remain
<br>
the same, whether their output satisfies consumers or not. Accordingly, as a
<br>
result of the expansion of 'public' sector employment, there will be
<br>
increasing laziness, carelessness, incompeence, disservice, maltreatment,
<br>
waste, and even destruction - and at the same time ever more arrogance,
<br>
demagogery, and lies ('we work for the public good').
<br>
<p>After less than one hundred years of democracy and redistribution, the
<br>
predictable results are in. The 'reserve fund' that was inherited from the
<br>
past is apparently exhausted. For several decades (since the late 1960s or
<br>
the early 1970s), real standards of living have stagnated or even fallen in
<br>
the West. The 'public' debt and the cost of the existing social security and
<br>
health care system have brought on the prospect of an imminent economic
<br>
meltdown. At the same time, almost every form of undesirable behavior -
<br>
unemployment, welfare dependency, negligence, recklessness, uncivility,
<br>
psychopathy, hedonism and crime - has increased, and social conflict and
<br>
societal breakdown have risen to dangerous heights. If current trends
<br>
continue, it is safe to say that the Western welfare state (social
<br>
democracy) will collapse just as Eastern (Russian-style) socialism collapsed
<br>
in the late 1980s.
<br>
<p>However, economic collapse does not automatically lead to improvement.
<br>
Matters can become worse rather than better. What is necessary besides a
<br>
crisis are ideas - correct ideas - and men capable of understanding and
<br>
implementing them once the opportunity arises. Ultimately, the course of
<br>
history is determined by ideas, be they true or false, and by men acting
<br>
upon and being inspired by true or false ideas. The current mess is also the
<br>
result of ideas. It is the result of the overwhelming acceptance, by public
<br>
opinion, of the idea of democracy. As long as this acceptance prevails, a
<br>
catastrophy will be unavoidable, and there is no hope for improvement even
<br>
after its arrival. On the other hand, once the idea of democracy is
<br>
recognized as false and vicious - and ideas can, in principle, be changed
<br>
almost instantaneously - a catastrophy can be avoided.
<br>
<p>The central task ahead of those wanting to turn the tide and prevent an
<br>
outright breakdown is the 'delegitimation' of the idea of democracy as the
<br>
root cause of the present state of progressive 'decivilization'. To this
<br>
purpose, one should first point out that it is difficult to find many
<br>
proponents of democracy in the history of political theory. Almost all major
<br>
thinkers had nothing but contempt for democracy. Even the Founding Fathers
<br>
of the U.S., nowadays considered the model of a democracy, were strictly
<br>
opposed to it. Without a single exception, they thought of democracy as
<br>
nothing but mob-rule. They considered themselves to be members of a 'natural
<br>
aristocracy', and rather than a democracy they advocated an aristocratic
<br>
republic. Furthermore, even among the few theoretical defenders of democracy
<br>
such as Rousseau, for instance, it is almost impossible to find anyone
<br>
advocating democracy for anything but extremely small communities (villages
<br>
or towns). Indeed, in small communities where everyone knows everyone else
<br>
personally most people cannot but acknowledge that the position of the
<br>
'haves' is typically based on their superior personal achievement just as
<br>
the position of the 'have-nots' finds its typical explanation in their
<br>
personal deficiencies and inferiority. Under these circumstances, it is far
<br>
more difficult to get away with trying to loot other people and their
<br>
personal property to one's advantage. In distinct contrast, in large
<br>
territories encompassing millions or even hundreds of millions of people,
<br>
where the potential looters do not know their victims, and vice versa, the
<br>
human desire to enrich oneself at another's expense is subject to little or
<br>
no restraints.
<br>
<p>More importantly, it must be made clear again that the idea of democracy is
<br>
immoral as well as uneconomical. As for the moral status of majority rule,
<br>
it must be pointed out that it allows for A and B to band together to rip
<br>
off C, C and A in turn joining to rip off B, and then B and C conspiring
<br>
against A, etc..This is not justice but a moral outrage, and rather than
<br>
treating democracy and democrats with respect, they should be treated with
<br>
open contempt and ridiculed as moral frauds. On the other hand, as for the
<br>
economic quality of democracy, it must be stressed relentlessly that it is
<br>
not democracy but private property, production, and voluntary exchange that
<br>
are the ultimate sources of human civilization and prosperity. In
<br>
particular, contrary to widespread myths, it needs to be emphasized that the
<br>
lack of democracy had essentially nothing to do with the bankruptcy of
<br>
Russian-style socialism. It was not the selection principle for politicians
<br>
that constituted socialism's problem. It was politics and political
<br>
decision-making as such. Instead of each private producer deciding
<br>
independently what to do with particular resources, as under a regime of
<br>
private property and contractualism, with fully or partially socialized
<br>
factors of production each decision requires someone else's permission. It
<br>
is irrelevant to the producer how those giving permission are chosen. What
<br>
matters to him is that permission must be sought at all. As long as this is
<br>
the case, the incentive of producers to produce is reduced and
<br>
impoverishment will result. Private property is as incompatible with
<br>
democracy, then, as with any other form of political rule. Rather than
<br>
democracy, justice as well as economic efficiency require a pure and
<br>
unrestricted private property society - an 'anarchy of production' - in
<br>
which no one rules anybody, and all producers' relations are voluntary, and
<br>
thus mutually beneficial.
<br>
<p>Lastly, as for strategic considerations, in order to approach the goal of a
<br>
non-exploitative social order, i.e., a private property anarchy, the idea of
<br>
majoritarianism should be turned against democratic rule itself. Under any
<br>
form of governmental rule, including a democracy, the 'ruling class'
<br>
(politicians and civil servants) makes up only a small proportion of the
<br>
total population. While it is possible that one hundred parasites may lead a
<br>
comfortable life on the products of one thousand hosts, one thousand
<br>
parasites cannot live off of one hundred hosts. Based on the recognition of
<br>
this fact, it would appear possible to persuade a majority of the voters
<br>
that it is adding insult to injury to let those living off of other peoples'
<br>
taxes have a say in how high these taxes are, and to thus decide,
<br>
democratically, to take the right to vote away from all government employees
<br>
and everyone who receives government benefits, whether they are welfare
<br>
recipients or government contractors. In addition, in conjunction with this
<br>
strategy it is necessary to recognize the overwhelming importance of
<br>
secession and secessionist movements. If majority decisions are 'right',
<br>
then the largest of all possible majorities, a world majority and a
<br>
democratic world government, must be considered ultimately 'right' with the
<br>
consequences predicted at the outset of this article. In contrast, secession
<br>
always involves the breaking away of smaller from larger populations. It is
<br>
thus a vote against the principle of democracy and majoritarianism. The
<br>
further the process of secession proceeds - to the level of small regions,
<br>
cities, city districts, towns, villages, and ultimately individual
<br>
households and voluntary associations of private households and firms - the
<br>
more difficult it will become to maintain the current level of
<br>
redistributive policies. At the same time, the smaller the territorial
<br>
units, the more likely it will be that a few individuals, based on the
<br>
popular recognition of their economic independence, outstanding professional
<br>
achievement, morally impeccable personal life, superior judgement, courage,
<br>
and taste, will rise to the rank of natural, voluntarily acknowledged elites
<br>
and lend legitimacy to the idea of a natural order of competing
<br>
(non-monopolistic) and freely (voluntarily) financed peacekeepers, judges,
<br>
and overlapping jurisdictions as exists even now in the arena of
<br>
international trade and travel - a pure private law society - as the answer
<br>
to democracy and any other form of political (coercive) rule.
