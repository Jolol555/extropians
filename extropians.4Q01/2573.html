</em><br>
<p>indeed i would like to see. 
<br>
in NYC - where terrorists attacked - many cases of such behaviour occured - basing from
<br>
recent and past press publications.
<br>
<p>also goverement which is outta controll for decades (huh!) and controlling substance
<br>
consumption (like FDA - looking @ their papers and webpages can bring you a headache..)
<br>
is _purely_ totalitarian, realisation of orwell's 1984, with the elements of richard bachman.
<br>
i believe in stupidity, but attack of foregin country is international violation.
<br>
access error my friends.
<br>
denied
<br>
you can't delete a country - it is write-protected.
<br>
only thing citizens should do in such situation is sending current goverement to 
<br>
psychiatric ward.
<br>
paranoid schizophrenia.
