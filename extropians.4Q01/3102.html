<p>I think the US was right (well, right as a state can be) to use
<br>
atomic bombs to force Japan's surrender.  The &quot;hard way&quot; would've
<br>
resulted in much more misery on both sides.  Japan would probably
<br>
be an impoverished third world country today, and a year or more
<br>
of continued war would have posed serious threats to domestic
<br>
freedom.
<br>
<p>I just learned of a shocking example of the latter last night while
<br>
reading David Henderson's &lt;<a href="http://www.davidrhenderson">http://www.davidrhenderson</a>&gt; &quot;The Joy of
<br>
Freedom: An Economist's Odyssey&quot;.  In early 1945 Roosevelt proposed
<br>
a law giving the Director of War Mobilization the power to prevent
<br>
workers from quitting their jobs or taking new jobs without
<br>
permission, punishable by a year in prison and/or a $10k (nearly
<br>
$100k in today's dollars) fine.  The bill passed in the house, but
<br>
was defeated in the senate 46 to 29 after the Director admitted
<br>
that the law was &quot;needed&quot; not only far war production, but also
<br>
for civilian goods and post-war reconversion (I hear a ratchet in
<br>
the background) and another official said that the manpower situation
<br>
was in excellent shape.
<br>
<p>However, the US made a grave mistake in a-bombing Japanese _cities_.
<br>
Total destruction of some relatively open space would have sufficed
<br>
to demonstrate overwhelming destructive capacity.
<br>
<p>This goes against what I wrote above, but I have to wonder what
<br>
the world would be like today if the US hadn't also immediately
<br>
a-bombed the Soviet Union into submission, thus freeing Eastern
<br>
Europe, ending communism and empire in the USSR/Russia, and possibly
<br>
averting 50 years of communism in China and 45 years of cold war
<br>
(at least the cold war that we experienced).
