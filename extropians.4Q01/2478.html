<em>&gt; There is water out there.  Dont know where it is coming

<p>Somebody's been messin' with their water:

<br>
In October 1874, as the mines of Panamint City and Cerro Gordo waned in
<br>
importance, rich silver-lead deposits were discovered south and east of Owens
<br>
Lake. By the end of that year, a town had sprung up at the foot of Mount Ophir
<br>
in this region. The town was named Darwin in honor of Dr. Darwin French, an
<br>
early explorer of the territory east of the Sierra Nevada. One of the first
<br>
arrivals at the new settlement was Victor Beaudry, who laid nine miles of
<br>
hand-riveted pipe from a spring in the Coso Range. Following him was a
<br>
stampede of miners from Panamint City and Cerro Gordo, and from the lawless
<br>
Nevada towns of Pioche, Columbus and Eureka. Mining claims in the area were
<br>
held only by right of gun barrel, and claim holders found it necessary to live
<br>
on their locations to protect them against claim jumpers.
<br>
The population of Darwin at its peak in 1876 is variously given at between
<br>
1,500 and 4,500, but the latter figure is almost certainly exaggerated. It is
<br>
known, however, that there were five smelters, more than 20 operating mines
<br>
and about 200 frame houses. Fire devastated the town several times. Population
<br>
steadily declined as ore deposits were depleted. In the 1940s, the Anaconda
<br>
Copper Company developed a large mine in the area, and Darwin - for a time -
<br>
provided two-thirds of California's lead output. Historically, mining
<br>
activities (those of Anaconda Copper Company in particular) have provided the
<br>
economic and employment base of the community.
<br>
Anaconda operations terminated in the early 1970s. Since then, smaller-scale
<br>
sporadic mining operations have characterized local economic activity. The
<br>
Montecito operation, located in Lucky Jim Wash, involved reworking the
<br>
Anaconda mine tailings and several levels of the Darwin mine; like other area
<br>
mining activity, this ended after only a short time. Barring discovery of
<br>
high-value mineral deposits, mining operations are expected to remain small
<br>
and sporadic, contributing little employment or economic development.
<br>
<p>Darwin resources now near nil
<br>
Without its traditional mining activity, and located some six miles south of
<br>
State Route 190, Darwin possesses few - if any - resources that might provide
<br>
an economic base. As a consequence, Darwin residents depend on social
<br>
security, pensions and temporary employment for income. Under these
<br>
circumstances, the per-capita and aggregate incomes of Darwin are severely
<br>
limited, affecting the capital available for housing and community
<br>
development.
<br>
<p>Darwin has attracted people seeking a lifestyle only available in an isolated
<br>
rural desert community without an economic base.
<br>
<p>Darwinites (a.k.a. Darwinians) value the solitude and beauty of the desert,
<br>
the historic character of the community and the close sense of community
<br>
shared by residents. Despite their modest incomes, Darwinites are typically
<br>
self-reliant, both as individuals and as a community. The community tends to
<br>
rely on its own resources rather than seek outside assistance whenever
<br>
possible. For example, maintenance of the troublesome water system is
<br>
performed by community volunteers, rather than through more formal
<br>
institutional means.
<br>
<p>In 1967, Superior Court Judge McMurry offered Darwin lots to the public for $5
<br>
apiece on a first-come basis.
<br>
<p>Originally mapped in about 1906, Darwin townsite covered 80.6 acres and
<br>
originally contained approximately 519 full or partial parcels. Designed for
<br>
the needs of another era, Darwin parcels were 42 feet wide and 100 feet long,
<br>
containing 4,200 square feet. The platted townsite is a basic grid design,
<br>
composed of blocks of 10 parcels (two tandem rows of 5 parcels, each separated
<br>
by an alley) with streets and avenues separating the blocks. While the
<br>
townsite is rectangular, north and south, the grid was established on a
<br>
diagonal - resulting in many partial parcels, cut off by the townsite
<br>
boundaries.
<br>
<p>Originally containing approximately 519 parcels, Darwin now contains about 230
<br>
ownerships (1978), Darwin was significantly affected by a decision of Inyo
<br>
County Superior Court Judge McMurry. In 1967, acting as trustee for the unsold
<br>
townsite lots, he offered these lots to the public for $5 apiece (that's right
<br>
five bucks) on a first-come basis. Because of the judge's action, much of
<br>
Darwin is owned by people who are unlikely to ever call Darwin &quot;home.&quot; The
<br>
effect of this &quot;speculative&quot; ownership pattern is difficult to assess except
<br>
that the absentee owners are unlikely to encourage additional
<br>
property-tax-financed community development, adding to the existing
<br>
constrained financial situation.
<br>
<p>Continuing problems associated with an inaccurate and imprecise survey of the
<br>
townsite led to a re-survey of the townsite by the Inyo county surveyor.
<br>
<p>Water demand often exceeds supply
<br>
Much existing housing is in poor condition (1978 data) although increasing use
<br>
of mobile homes and trailers has improved the overall quality. Services are
<br>
limited to nonexistent (no stores or gas stations). The water supply, which
<br>
comes from a spring in the Coso Range some nine miles to the south on China
<br>
Lake Naval Weapons Center property, is inadequate. Supply is a critical
<br>
problem; demand often exceeds supply. Parts of the community actually run out
<br>
of water.
<br>
<p>Septic systems and older pit privies are used for sanitary waste disposal, and
<br>
a caliche layer presents makes septic-system installation very difficult. The
<br>
community lacks fire-protection services, although a tank truck and pump have
<br>
been maintained for this purpose by the community from time to time.
<br>
<p>Thus, in the 100-year-plus history of Darwin, it has gone from a boom-and-bust
<br>
mining community to an almost exclusively rural residential community with
<br>
several significant problems confronting its future.

<p>A longer brief history of Darwin, California
<br>
By Robert P. Palazzo

<br>
Darwin, California was not always the tiny Mojave Desert ghost town that it is
<br>
today. In the 1870s, it was a rough-and-tumble mining boomtown, boasting a
<br>
population of over 3,000--more than half the head count of then Los Angeles.
<br>
Darwin mines produced the second largest amount of silver in California
<br>
history, only lagging behind nearby Cerro Gordo.
<br>
<p>&quot;It seemed . . . impossible that it could be a town where human beings lived .
<br>
. . There could be no living in the higher sense in a place so devoid of
<br>
everything that makes life even physically endurable.&quot;
<br>
Samuel D. Woods (California congressman, 1900-1903) about Darwin in 1882.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
