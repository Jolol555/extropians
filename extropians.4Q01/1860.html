<p>&lt;&lt;   In the final analysis all that can be said about our Elites is that they
<br>
&nbsp;are
<br>
&nbsp;arguably less violent with regards to their stock, and that they don't have
<br>
&nbsp;to be because they are much more skilled liars.  :::shrug:::
<br>
<em>  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>My sense of it is the most skilled liars are the lawyers and those who have 
<br>
achived command through attending West Point, and Annapolis.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;We are being farmed, people. Many people, when confronted with these facts,
<br>
just say, &quot;well, some people are farmed, other are farmers. I plan on being
<br>
a farmer.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Tangentially, there is the notion of unintended results. Jews were banned 
<br>
from farming, as a means of earning a living in pre-19th century Europe and 
<br>
the Islamic world. They were permitted, to be money-lenders (Christians were 
<br>
banned by the Church to do this).
<br>
<p>It is worth noting that nazi Pierce seems to have instructed or goaded his 
<br>
followers to committ attacks, but never ever put his own ass on the line. 
<br>
Talk about people farming.
