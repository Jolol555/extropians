</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9 : a conscious substratum or factor in the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [More hocus-pocus mystical nonsense.]
</em><br>
<p>The problem here is that this might lead to a confusion of words with
<br>
concepts.  Concepts and words do not exactly match up.  Another way of
<br>
putting this: a concept should only admit of one definition or of
<br>
definitions that are consistent, but words can admit of many since one
<br>
word can signify more than one concept.  For instance, &quot;red&quot; can mean
<br>
the color (as in &quot;the red apple&quot;) or a political affiliation (as in &quot;Joe
<br>
is a red and his brother is a pinko&quot;:).  (Also, one concept can be
<br>
signified by more than one word -- as in &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; used in
<br>
the context of classical liberal thought.  Both can defined as &quot;the
<br>
absense of coercion&quot; and truly stand for the same concept within that
<br>
limited framework.)
<br>
<p>Even so, this doesn't nullify your rejection of the concept of mind.
<br>
Also, some of the above definitions just show metaphorical uses, such as
<br>
&quot;the public mind&quot; in definition 7a.  I don't think one should go to the
<br>
barricades over such usages, especially since in the context they are
<br>
used they are generally not typically confusing.  (If you bijectively
<br>
map extant words and concepts, then, yes, there will be problems with
<br>
understanding, but &quot;mind&quot; will hardly be the biggest problem here.  In
<br>
fact, so many words correspond to more than one concept, that you'll
<br>
have to come up with a new dictionary and probably many neologisms,
<br>
since, I suspect, the number of concepts in use is much higher than that
<br>
of words in use at any given time.)
<br>
<p>Why not instead, keep the word &quot;mind&quot; and clearly use it only in those
<br>
context where is does not promote a mystical/supernatural/idealist
<br>
worldview?  After all, Objectivists, neoAristoteleans, and neoStoics (I
<br>
only know of Becker here) use it that way and they are not mystics,
<br>
don't buy into a supernatural realm, and certainly reject ontological
<br>
and epistemological idealism.  (In other words, definitions 1, 2, and
<br>
all of 3 are not problematic for them -- as they really don't seem to be
<br>
for you.  After all, if I came up with a new word for &quot;mind&quot; defintion
<br>
one -- let's call it &quot;botango&quot; -- you probably would not find that
<br>
problematic.  Or would you?)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
