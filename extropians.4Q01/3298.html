<em>&gt;&gt; The problem, of course, is that while perfect capitalism has never be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; statutorily allowed to be tried,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eh?!?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something a lot of Libertarians seem to avoid thinking about is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that the minarchist night-watchman state with unhampered capitalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they crave *has* actually been tried. And found wanting.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so, but let's go on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Britain, 1770-1870 or thereabouts. It's near as dammit the minarchist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state they keep banging on about. No income tax, night-watchman goverment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a navy (the main military force) than ran at a profit (by enforcing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blockades with confiscation of blockade-runner's assets) and so on.
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly.  The British Empire at that time did implement a few free
<br>
market policies, but overall it was not a minarchy.  Taxing, regulating
<br>
trade, regulating the banking system, etc. do not a minarchy make.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was a roaring success for business -- but it wasn't a very nice place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for ordinary people to live and it sowed the seeds of its own collapse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clue: the pollution was so bad that massive public works had to be created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deal with it (read up on The Great Stink of 1853 if you don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me). Second clue: social conditions were sufficiently bad that *England*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was where Marx expected the communist revolution to break out. Third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clue: the libertarian &quot;utopia&quot; of imperial Britain was dismantled from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inside out by its own people.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, pollution was encouraged by the governments of England at that
<br>
time abrogating private property rights.  If property had been protected and
<br>
extended, then would be polluters would have had the law against them.
<br>
Minarchy is not about one group using the government to take (e.g., tax) or
<br>
damage (e.g., pollute) another's property.  In fact, that's exactly why many
<br>
classical liberals, libertarians, and Objectivists want a minarchy: to stop
<br>
such takings.
<br>
<p>It's notable, too, that during much of the same period, government power in
<br>
Britain grew.  In some areas, granted, there was a decline, but overall it
<br>
grew.  (Ditto for the US.  Federal government power especially grew during
<br>
the 19th and even more so in the 20th centuries.  The trend continues,
<br>
mostly unabated in the US.  In Britain, at least, some secessionists are
<br>
asserting themselves -- in Scotland and Wales.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
