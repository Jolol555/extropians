Kai: thanks for responding. I've broken things up into 8 mind-sized chunks.

<em>&gt; I don't know if you got my point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) I wouldn't feel safe with _anyone_ in that bar carrying a gun, not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you or me. 
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; (3) I am talking from my perspective here in Germany, where we'd rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call the police than try to play the hero. (cf. Sting: &quot;Englishman In New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; York&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>1--OK, I get that. Guns are just scary as far as you are concerned, as is anyone carrying one.
<br>
No exceptions. Very clear. But then...
<br>
<p>3--Uh oh. Now I am confused, help me out. Are cops somehow not-people? This lemma is broken:
<br>
<p>(*) Anyone with a gun is bad. Cops are good. Cops have guns. 
<br>
<p>Please explain this inconsistency, or explain where I err. If cops are _better_ than people,
<br>
then we have an example of someone who has that magic I asked about in my Q5. Don't we?
<br>
<p><p><p>2 KAI:
<br>
<em>&gt; See, I don't accept that a free and liberal society has to be so dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that their citizens only feel safe when they carry a deadly weapon.
</em><br>
<p>We are in utter agreement on this point, as written. There are a bunch of grand generalizations
<br>
in it, though, so I can tell you that it's my feeling that I have never lived in such a society
<br>
as you describe, and I think I never shall.
<br>
<p>Since I have read the novel _Stand on Zanzibar_ by John Brunner, however, I must point out 
<br>
that in the appropriate (evil? violent, certainly) frame of mind, _anything_ really can be
<br>
a deadly weapon. A plate glass window. A pencil. A rolled-up magazine. A stiff finger.
<br>
Lots of this stuff is everywhere you go. Some of it you'd have to amputate to be free of.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless of course I agree completely with your sentiment. All that stuff doesn't make the world any more dangerous;
<br>
it simply is what it is.
<br>
<p>But let me think of one subculture in the US that you might be talking about, as if it were the whole society:
<br>
<p>Inner cities. For now, specifically, their schools.
<br>
<p>I hear reports that there are _some_ highschools where _some_ students are criminals who carry
<br>
firearms, and there are _other_ (scared) students who carry their own in response. This in no
<br>
way pleases me, and I wish I could change it. That is at present beyond my powers. It sucks.
<br>
<p>Regarding age association &lt;25 with gun misbehavior:
<br>
<p>Very likely. Same goes for renting cars. I completely agree that impulse control is key. 
<br>
It's one of the reasons young people in boot camp get the &quot;Chaka Zulu&quot; resocialization
<br>
treatment. But see the movie &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; for the nightmare scenario.
<br>
<p>But I knew a fair number of trustworthy kids when I shot rifle in the Boy Scouts, and not one of them
<br>
ever killed anyone or even waved a gun around. What counts is the individual.
<br>
<p>Given the status quo in that school I mentioned, I can't wave a magic wand. I can't in good conscience tell a scared kid
<br>
who *does* have good impulse control, and *does* obey his momma, and *does* have a justifed fear--specific, articulable,
<br>
and present, of deadly violence--that he has the absolute obligation to not do what he can to feel more in control of
<br>
his destiny. I _still_ trust such a kid over the crack smoker/gangsta.
<br>
<p>Let's move out of the school.
<br>
<p>The same goes for a nurse in an empty hospital parking garage at 4 AM, down near where they keep the narcotics. That
<br>
nurse is precisely zero threat to me, and if she's trained and practices properly, just about zero threat to anyone but
<br>
bad guys.
<br>
<p>And yes, there are some bad places in the US, and yes, it sucks that there are.
<br>
<p><p><p>3 KAI:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The following comment is a cultural one, not a racist one (sad that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need to say that):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The occupants of the place were mostly Dominicans, the man who set the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; torch was Puerto Rican. So there might have been some culture mismatch;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the other major dance club fire ever set in the US and Territories was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Puerto Rico; perhaps a Puerto Rican crowd would have read the man as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; potent threat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have heard this argument before: &quot;The minorities&quot; are far more violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and criminal than the rest. (I won't discuss prejudices of the police and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice here) It is sad to say that the numbers seem to confirm this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, in the US as well as here.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This argument&quot;? 
<br>
<p>Minorities being more unhappy, or violent, or criminal, is a really complex topic.
<br>
I don't feel qualified to discuss it, and so I don't bring it up.
<br>
<p>That was not my point at all. My point was that different cultures learn different
<br>
cues for abnormal behavior, and that just as &quot;Moroccans stand too close for Americans&quot;
<br>
is a sociological heuristic, &quot;A homicidally jealous Puerto Rican does not typically 
<br>
appear homicidal to a recent Dominican emigre&quot; might be another.
<br>
<p>A more colorful example: a Masai herder who talks about having a nice cup of blood for breakfast
<br>
is simply discussing daily life; a Wall Street banker straightfacedly saying the same thing 
<br>
to an important conservative client would cause some raised eyebrows.
<br>
<p><p><p>4 KAI:
<br>
<em>&gt; Someone also suggested that the reason for the different crime rates is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inhomogeneity(?) of the US society compared to a more homogeneous Europe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hm. But the &quot;majority&quot; also consists of former minorities, here as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the US, correct? Unless you propose that the &quot;new minorities&quot; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrinsically more violent than the &quot;old&quot;, what magic turned a mixture of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minorities into a homogeneous, peaceful, law abiding majority?
</em><br>
<p>I can't answer that, since I am not confident of the premise and never claimed the premise as mine.
<br>
<p><p><p>5 KAI:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ***
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   Q5: What magic is there that transforms an ordinary person into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trustworthy one? ***
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this question explains the difference between us... My experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that more than 99.99% of the &quot;ordinary persons&quot; here are non-violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons. Trustworthy in the sense that they won't rob or kill me, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they could. 
</em><br>
<p>*Laugh*
<br>
<p>Kai! Good news! This question was phrased in the way that it was because of 
<br>
the _sameness_ between us. Day to day, I treat my life the same way as you say.
<br>
<p>I trust people. And I own a gun.
<br>
<p>I phrased it the way I did because I think that that 99.99% you mention might 
<br>
be able to be trusted with guns, too, but you seem to think they can't be trusted
<br>
with guns--which makes them untrustworthy in the first place, because if I can't
<br>
trust them with a gun, how can I trust them with a dollar's worth of gasoline?
<br>
Both items are trivial to kill with. Yet life goes on.
<br>
<p><p><p>6 KAI:
<br>
<em>&gt; Lunatics and violent persons are a very small minority. So, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; default assumption is &quot;non-violent until proven different&quot; (which doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imply that I leave my house or my car unlocked, though). If you'd say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this standard assumption is different in the US, then we might have one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the soft factors (or a symptom of it).
</em><br>
<p>The funny thing is, I extend the default assumption to include 
<br>
&quot;non-violent until proven different&quot; even when I think about
<br>
(mature, responsible) adults having guns. Or Molotov cocktails.
<br>
Or lots of things. All I ask is that they not fuck up and not scare me
<br>
by waving them around or setting them off irresponsibly.
<br>
<p>And I am still capable of doing my best to respond to adversity 
<br>
in some way other than as a victim; I know I do not have a victim's 
<br>
attitude as my only choice if it turns out my trust is someday misplaced. 
<br>
Having no gun handy makes little difference to me, as I've tried to make clear.
<br>
Am I a barbarian, or just &quot;facultative&quot;?
<br>
<p>You have indicated that even _wanting_ to own any gun, any time, anywhere
<br>
is a sign of psychopathology. Pardon me, but I think that's really silly.
<br>
<p>A loaded gun is just a couple of ounces of low explosive wrapped in metal.
<br>
I know you could go to a hardware store and make one for $10, and there is nothing
<br>
I can do about it, so I live my life confident that you are probably part of the 
<br>
99.99%, absent obvious clues to the contrary.
<br>
<p>For you, though, it seems as if there's a problem once anyone thinks about having a gun.
<br>
<p>I'm really interested in a response to my (*) problem above, about cops, in the section labeled 1 KAI:.
<br>
Crazy (they have guns, they willingly pick them up) cops are a reason to feel safe? 
<br>
<p>This makes no sense. Please explain.
<br>
<p><p><p>7 KAI:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From my point of view, I'd rather ask it the other way:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) What evil magic transforms an ordinary person into a mass-murderer?
</em><br>
<p>A fair question. I have no final answer. I agree the question is important,
<br>
and am happy to see that we agree.
<br>
<p>Since you have posed it in that form, let me pose a question in reply:
<br>
<p>Is it the evil magic of the demon-possessed handgun carried on the person?
<br>
Like the enchanted sword of Elric of Melnibone, it must taste human souls? 
<br>
I don't think so. You have talked as if you do think so.
<br>
<p><p><p>8 KAI:
<br>
<em>&gt; (1) (the even more interesting question) How can we all (every person on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this planet) live together when we cannot risk that anyone is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;disgruntled&quot; that he starts a mass-killing with some &quot;empowering&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology?
</em><br>
<p>A very good question. I wish you luck and courage in finding an answer
<br>
that satisfies you. I would suggest a reframing away from &quot;we cannot risk&quot;
<br>
because that seems to translate to &quot;the risk must be 0&quot;, and I know no way
<br>
to accomplish such a thing.
<br>
<p>Your question has a melancholy counterpart: What if we cannot all live together? 
<br>
How might we nonetheless live as rightly as possible? Surely not by huddling in fear
<br>
of everyone's capacity to do harm?
<br>
<p>We are moving toward a time when, conceivably, any arbitrary collection of atoms
<br>
will be trivial to create. What is to be done?
<br>
<p><p>Whew! Thanks for the workout.
