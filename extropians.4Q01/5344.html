<p>Not quite yet.
<br>
<p>I currently work for a subsidiary of West Legal Group, the megacorp that
<br>
owns the copyright on the reference system most US lawyers use to refer
<br>
to US laws and cases.  Or, in short: they think they own the law in the
<br>
US, and they're arguably right from a certain point of view.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I was discussing the idea of lawyer-bots with my group's CTO,
<br>
and how we might be able to develop them.  The closest thing he had
<br>
heard of was a limited use script, used by some Brazilian judges to
<br>
quickly decide standard traffic cases (accidents, et cetera).  I
<br>
proposed, as a first generation, a lawyer's aide that could predict,
<br>
better than lawyers themselves with the tools they currently have, what
<br>
the likely outcome of a case would be, based on the facts available and
<br>
the evidence each side was likely to be able to obtain.  (I had to
<br>
justify this in monetary terms somehow, and that seemed an easy path
<br>
from tech to money.  Besides, it was an extension of the Brazilian
<br>
script he already knew was working.)
<br>
<p>He seemed to like the idea and believed the core tech was feasable, but
<br>
soured on the interface: if it's going to be the hundreds or thousands
<br>
of pull-down menus and similar widgets needed to properly classify a
<br>
case, forget it.  I considered free-text entry, say like an advanced
<br>
chatbot, but figured that natural language processing probably is not
<br>
advanced enough for use by lawyers (except those lawyers who are also
<br>
geeks, but that dramatically narrows the target market).
<br>
<p>I figured this might be a good way to pump money into practical AI
<br>
development, not to mention start automating away a sector that already
<br>
has far too many people working in it - changing things to a legal code,
<br>
as programmers understand the word &quot;code&quot;, and hopefully reducing the
<br>
costs of being sued for something one did not commit (which, in and of
<br>
itself, seems to be one of the biggest factors stifling research and
<br>
experimentation, at least in the US).  But unless I can get past the
<br>
interface problem (different interface? different product?), no dice in
<br>
this approach.
<br>
<p>Does anyone here has any practical suggestions on how to solve this
<br>
problem?
