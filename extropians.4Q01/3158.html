This NY Times article:
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/06/health/06EMBR.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/06/health/06EMBR.html</a>
<br>
<p>points out work at MIT and ACT that seems to suggest
<br>
that methods exist to convince eggs (at least primate
<br>
eggs) to develop via parthenogenesis into cells that
<br>
can be used for stem cell research.
<br>
<p>It suggests its relatively easy to start off the division
<br>
process for female eggs.  Its a bit more difficult for
<br>
sperm (you have to transfer at least 1, perhaps 2 sperm
<br>
nuclei into the egg).  Interestingly enough the success
<br>
rates are pretty high, 40% of the eggs reach the blastocyst
<br>
stage.
<br>
<p>Interestingly enough the stem cells resulting from this
<br>
approach will be &quot;self-compatible&quot; (if developed from
<br>
ones own eggs or sperm).  One possible down side however
<br>
will be the fact that defective genes whose effects are
<br>
normally masked by a dominant non-defective allele could
<br>
become unmasked.  One way to work around this would be
<br>
to create tissue &quot;mosaics&quot; derived from multiple stem
<br>
cell lines where different cells had different defective
<br>
alleles causing ill-effects.  Natural selection of the
<br>
best cells as the tissue develops should eliminate the
<br>
worst problems.
<br>
<p>This approach is *really* going to annoy various groups
<br>
however because the approach generates stem cells via
<br>
non-fertilization based routes which from at least some
<br>
perspectives doesn't look like you are dealing with
<br>
a &quot;real&quot; human being.  Its going to push such groups
<br>
more into the camp of having to say literally &quot;any&quot;
<br>
cell with at least 23 chromosomes of human DNA can
<br>
develop into a human so killing any cell so described
<br>
is equivalent to killing a human being.  On the slippery
<br>
slope for sure!
