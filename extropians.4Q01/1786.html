The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution. Pierre Baldi. xiv + 245 pp.
<br>
The MIT Press, 2001. $24.95.
<br>
<p>In the 20th century, science and technology helped shape modernism and its
<br>
radical new conception of what it means to be human. Rooted in a Freudian
<br>
vitalism, this conception suggested that the true self was irrational,
<br>
consumptive and perhaps ultimately unknowable. As radical as the modern human
<br>
image was, however, it retained a traditional element—the notion that each
<br>
person is unique, with precisely delimited boundaries demarcating self, other
<br>
and world. The striking thesis of Pierre Baldi’s new book, The Shattered Self,
<br>
is that biological and computational sciences—whose major advances came only
<br>
after modernism was firmly entrenched—are poised to shatter this facet of the
<br>
self. In so doing, they will force us to rethink what it means to be human,
<br>
from our beliefs about self, life and death to our understanding of
<br>
intelligence and sexuality.
<br>
<p>Baldi, the director of the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics at the
<br>
University of California, Irvine, is well positioned to write a book probing
<br>
the implications of biotechnologies and computer science. Intended for the
<br>
layperson, the book is written in a nontechnical, accessible style, with
<br>
more-technical material relegated to five appendices. In the opening chapter,
<br>
Baldi does an admirable job of orienting the reader by outlining the
<br>
decentering capacity of science, whereby a scientific understanding of reality
<br>
replaces an intuitive one. Following this, Baldi provides an extremely lucid
<br>
overview of molecular biology, providing the reader with the essentials for
<br>
the probing discussions to come.
<br>
<p>In chapters 4 through 7, Baldi explores biotechnology’s decentering through
<br>
such timely topics as emerging reproductive technologies, human cloning, stem
<br>
cells and DNA morphing, along with even more exotic possibilities such as
<br>
combining cloning with technologies used to artificially produce Siamese twins
<br>
(as has been done with frogs) to create Siamese-twin clones of oneself. Some
<br>
of the implications Baldi highlights seem a little questionable—for example,
<br>
the possibility that reproductive technologies will make sexual behavior
<br>
extinct. Human sexual behavior is only loosely tied to reproduction, as
<br>
evidenced by female extended sexual receptivity, making it highly unlikely
<br>
that sexual behavior will be marginalized as its reproductive role diminishes.
<br>
On the whole, however, Baldi admirably avoids making predictions and instead
<br>
focuses on charting the landscape of possibilities that might confront us.
<br>
<p>As interesting as the central chapters are, the last third of the book is the
<br>
most tantalizing. There Baldi departs from more-standard topical issues to
<br>
explore the relationship between biotechnology and computation, two major
<br>
forces that will shape the future. In the discussion of computation in chapter
<br>
8, information emerges as a central unifying theme. DNA is ultimately a medium
<br>
of information; nature, biotechnologies and computers thus share the common
<br>
currency of information. Because information can be distinguished from its
<br>
physical substrates, the decentering power of new technologies lies in
<br>
building interfaces between different kinds of information, ultimately
<br>
translating the information that defines individuals into new media.
<br>
<p>Baldi adds a number of intriguing back-of-the-envelope calculations to this
<br>
discussion, including an estimate of how much information is contained in a
<br>
lifetime of experience, or brain inputs: By his estimation, the amount is 2.2
<br>
¥ 1018 bits (about 2.7 ¥ 1017 bytes), which at current rates of memory storage
<br>
advances will be within the memory capacity of a typical personal computer in
<br>
27 years. Based on this, Baldi then investigates the information size of what
<br>
he calls the external self, a complete genomic sequence together with the
<br>
recording of all inputs and outputs of an individual’s brain over a lifetime,
<br>
which he estimates to be still on the order of 1018 bits, within reach of
<br>
modern computer technology. The internal self, the amount of information
<br>
required to capture the relevant structure of your brain that defines your
<br>
identity, is larger—at least 1027 bits—but might still be within reach of
<br>
emerging technologies. Ultimately, your individuality is representable as a
<br>
large but finite amount of information that could be stored and manipulated in
<br>
new technologies.
<br>
<p>These heuristic calculations illustrate that we inhabit an information space
<br>
whose depth and complexity science is only beginning to fathom. According to
<br>
Baldi, our growing capacity to manipulate this space may lead to the discovery
<br>
that our self-conception is based on the wrong data. The intriguing idea here
<br>
is that our self-conception, rooted in the notion of an enduring, discrete
<br>
self, might be a useful but ultimately erroneous evolutionary adaptation that
<br>
came about by inhabiting only the very tip of this information space. Baldi
<br>
suggests that decentering will come through realizing that the key elements of
<br>
this space—genomes, computations and minds—are fluid, continuous entities.
<br>
Thus the boundary between self, other and world will increasingly blur and
<br>
might eventually disappear as information flows freely among them.
<br>
<p>Reflecting on these possibilities, Baldi suggests that our emerging capacity
<br>
to manipulate this information space may well mean the end of natural
<br>
evolution, as technologies allow us to reinvent ourselves. What we will become
<br>
remains intriguing and ominous, making this probing book a valuable
<br>
contribution to thinking about our future.—Steven R. Quartz, Division of
