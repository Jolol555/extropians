<p>
And ad womanems ...
<br>
<p>Listen boys,
<br>
<p>I know you're joking, Dossy. And I do have a sense of humor--some people
<br>
would even say I have a perverted sense of humor. But I've also had to live
<br>
in a world in which women are treated as if they're less intelligent and
<br>
less capable than men in general; and in which women constantly have to be
<br>
afraid of being physically assaulted (if anyone doubts this, you can ask
<br>
almost any American woman you know how she feels about walking along a city
<br>
street at night); so verbal assaults are unwelcome.
<br>
<p>I find statements such as I've seen on the list these past couple of days
<br>
offensive (such as women drivers choosing to run into telephone poles? ...
<br>
gimme a break), and I don't think I'm unusual in that respect. A woman might
<br>
smile politely at such comments, but it's quite likely that her opinion of
<br>
you and her desire to be around you plummet when ... ahem ... stuff like
<br>
that splatters into the conversation.
