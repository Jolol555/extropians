<p>
For reference, the online Foresight Exchange game, a play money
<br>
Idea Futures market, has a betting claim regarding cloning.
<br>
<a href="http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Clone">http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Clone</a> rests on whether a
<br>
human clone will be born and survive to be 1 year old before January
<br>
1, 2005.  So it would have to be born by January 1, 2004 and therefore
<br>
&quot;conceived&quot; by the beginning of spring, 2003, about 16 months from now.
<br>
<p>The current betting sets the chance of success at about 40%.  This
<br>
estimate has been relatively stable over the 5-year life of the claim,
<br>
except for most of the year 2000 when the odds fell to 20%.  However they
<br>
climbed back to 40% in early 2001.
<br>
<p>Personally I think these odds are a little low; I would go as high as
<br>
50% or even 60% to see a cloned human born in the next two years.  I see
<br>
today that the Raelians claim that their human cloning experiments have
<br>
gone even farther than the recent results, to the blastocyst stage, and
<br>
another lab had also predicted that they would begin attempts to implant
<br>
cloned human embryos by this month.  The ACT experiments confirm that
<br>
real work is being done in this area, it's not just political posturing.
<br>
If the same is true for the other labs then I expect that some implant
<br>
experiments will be tried in the next year.
