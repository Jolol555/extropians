Spike's Newtonmass story reminded me to reprint, as I have customarily for 
<br>
several Ex-Mass holidays, one Extropian account of the reason for the season: 
<br>
&quot;The Ex-Mass Hoilday Season and The Story of Solar Cause,&quot; reprinted from 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/Ex-Mass.html">http://members.aol.com/t0morrow/Ex-Mass.html</a>&gt;.  Relative newbies might not 
<br>
know this bit of lore, after all.  I warn you that it has some groan-inducing 
<br>
puns, though.
<br>
<p>* * *
<br>
<p>The Ex-Mass Holiday Season and the Story of Solar Cause
<br>
<p><p>The Ex-Mass [fn1] holiday season amuses us with feasts and fêtes, socializes 
<br>
us in shared ceremonies, and educates us via allegory. It runs from the 
<br>
solstice nearest perihelion (winter solstice in the northern hemisphere, 
<br>
summer in the southern) until Sir Issac Newton's birthday on December 25th. 
<br>
Especially for children, the character of Solar Cause [fn2] plays a large 
<br>
role in Ex-Mass celebrations. Adults tend to focus more on such convivial 
<br>
rituals such as exchanging gifts, praising our stellar good-fortune, and 
<br>
meditating on the illuminating powers of human science and industry.
<br>
<p><p>The Story of Solar Cause
<br>
<p>For most of the year Solar Cause lives in the warm, yellow sun. He watches 
<br>
over the far-away Earth, making sure that it spins all through the day and 
<br>
all through the night. Once a year, the Earth's clockwork starts to run down. 
<br>
Day and night get so out of balance that one almost falls into the other! On 
<br>
that crazy day, Solar Cause reaches across the vastness of space and draws 
<br>
the Earth a little closer to the sun. He climbs down to fix our shivering 
<br>
little planet--and brings with him a bag full of presents for good boys and 
<br>
girls.
<br>
<p>Solar Cause comes to Earth on that special date to set things right. With a 
<br>
gentle nudge to the North pole, he puts day and night back onto course and 
<br>
sets the Earth whirling into another year. But each of our hearts spins on 
<br>
its own, private pole. Like the Earth they will, if left alone and untouched, 
<br>
tumble into weariness and confusion. When he comes to fix the Earth's orbit, 
<br>
then, Solar Cause nudges each our hearts to set them right, too.
<br>
<p>Grown-ups sense the touch of Solar Cause in a typically grown-up way: 
<br>
absent-mindedly, as if their feelings wore five layers of sweaters. But 
<br>
children! Their light hearts dance on Solar Cause's touch like motes in a 
<br>
sun-beam!
<br>
<p>Solar Cause has a special understanding with children. All through the year 
<br>
he traces the days and nights of their little hearts. He sees all their acts, 
<br>
both good and bad. Because Solar Cause loves extropy, he loves each child who 
<br>
plays nicely and studies well. Solar Cause dislikes the cold and dark of 
<br>
entropy, however. It thus grieves him to see children hurt their playmates or 
<br>
neglect their lessons.
<br>
<p>While Solar Cause watches over Earth's children, his vast fusion-powered 
<br>
factories teem with tiny workers making gifts. All year long they build toys 
<br>
and cook sweets. Solar Cause brings these gifts with him on that one special 
<br>
night when he comes to set the Earth back on course. Then, in the darkest 
<br>
hour of our longest night, he flies across the whole of the world. Solar Ca
<br>
use flies over our roofs and shines down through our windows and chimneys!
<br>
<p>Solar Cause visits each dreaming child. Because watching boys and girls 
<br>
*extrope* [fn3] during the rest of the year brings Solar Cause such great 
<br>
joy, he thanks each of them with a special present on this special night. But 
<br>
to children who did terribly entropic things during the year past, he gives 
<br>
only shadows.
<br>
<p>Of course, no one--not even adults--can act perfectly well all of the time! 
<br>
Solar Cause thus gives everybody at least a little bit of a shadow. These, 
<br>
our conscientious guardians, follow each of us throughout the year, reminding 
<br>
us to try and overcome our weaknesses and to improve ourselves as much as we 
<br>
possibly can.
<br>
<p>Dreaming through his visits, children do not see Solar Cause in all his 
<br>
glory. What does he look like, then? A mane of shining, golden hair rings his 
<br>
beaming face. His vibrant yellow costume reveals a fit, trim build. Solar 
<br>
Cause shines so brightly that, sometimes, even sleeping children feel his 
<br>
warm gaze. And, if their good acts have made Solar Cause especially happy, 
<br>
they may hear a light-hearted laugh echo through their dreams. &quot;He! He! He!&quot; 
<br>
Why gives Solar Cause so much joy? Elementary: Seeing Extropian children grow 
<br>
forward, upward, and outward!
<br>
<p><p>NOTES
<br>
<p>[1] Why &quot;Ex-Mass&quot;? Because the holiday celebrates the sun's conversion of 
<br>
mass into energy.
<br>
<p>[2] Solar Cause's female companion, Luna, plays a periodically recurring role 
<br>
in his story. But her lights merely reflect, to a greater or lesser extent, 
<br>
Solar Cause's own; he plays the star in the pageant of Ex-Mass.
<br>
<p>&quot;[3]Extrope&quot;: v.i. to advance the subject's extropy. So far as I can tell, 
<br>
Amara Graps coined this particular variation on &quot;extropy&quot;.
