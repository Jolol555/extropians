<p>Reuters is reporting that unnamed but potentially
<br>
informed sources suspect the Anthrax attacks were
<br>
caused by someone within the U.S. biological warfare
<br>
program who wanted to get funding increased.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------
<br>
<p>I recall not so long ago the announcement of the
<br>
sequencing of the genome of E. coli.  Bacterial
<br>
genomes are, as I understand it, quite short, and with
<br>
the huge leaps in the speed with which genomes can be 
<br>
read, it would seem likely that the ability to rapidly
<br>
read a bacterial genome is now nearly routine.  
<br>
<p>Consequently, it should not only be possible to
<br>
identify the anthrax in question as being of the Ames
<br>
variety, but to &quot;fingerprint&quot; the particular sample
<br>
and thereby determine with a far greater degree of
<br>
specificity where it came from, and when, and what's
<br>
been done with it since and for how long.
<br>
<p>For example, if the anthrax spores were taken from a
<br>
certain stockpile, stored for a while, and then sent
<br>
out in letters, the genomes of both the unactivated
<br>
spores and the live bacteria in infected persons would
<br>
show a certain degree of similarity to the original
<br>
stockpile.  
<br>
<p>If on the other hand, the spores in the letters were
<br>
derived from second or third generation cultures of
<br>
the original source, the genome might record that in
<br>
the accumulation of mutations, which as I understand
<br>
it, takes place at a given rate over time.  Also, the
<br>
exact nature of the mutations might reveal something
<br>
about the method used to culture the bacteria, since
<br>
the culture media would likely act as a selection
<br>
mechanism favoring certain bacterial variants over
<br>
others.  
<br>
<p>Also, with spores numbering in the millions(billions?)
<br>
there might be additional information to be derived
<br>
from statistical analysis.
<br>
<p>Robert is the pro on this, mayhaps he'll comment. 
<br>
Meanwhile, I'm gonna go check to see if my health
<br>
insurance covers blunt trauma injury.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
