<p>I agree with you about the society part, and it was also my point in my

original response to Lanier. 
<br>
<p>There are some bacteria and viruses that have learned to successfully
<br>
evade the immune system, like the cytomegalovirus. But I wouldn't
<br>
exactly call it non-threatening. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Mites and gut bacteria are normally not in contact with the immune

</em><br>
<p>Well, it might be a matter of semantics: sweat and other exudates
<br>
contain lysozyme and other non-specific proteins attacking bacteria and
<br>
parasites. I don't consider that to be the &quot;real&quot; immune system, but it
<br>
does have a protective function. So we are both right :-)

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Does freedom of information mean freedom of instantaneous

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;An interesting question. I think I would come down on the yes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;side. I can imagine the use of embargoing information for a while,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but who gets to decide on for how long? If that decision is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;possible to appeal, then it becomes possible for in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;information-embargoing groups to control information just as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they were doing actual censorship, simply by putting an extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;long embargo on the information. Once you start circumscribing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;freedom of information - even in the best interest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;many people - you allow further, just as reasonable, decreases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;freedom of information. Banning certain media can limit the flow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of information tremendously, and if new media are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;automatically given freedom then the effective freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;information might decrease - in many countries you may have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;right to write what you want on paper or in letters, but if it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;any point becomes digital it is suddenly not free. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we have to draw a distinction between freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and mass media. Mass media outlets in this country are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rarely even remotely fair, prefering to bias a story to their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views. This is the problem associated with out attempts and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networks out of Quatar.
</em><br>
<p>The fact that media are biased doesn't mean they should be treated as
<br>
less protected than what you and me say - we are biased too. If it
<br>
becomes allowable to silence biased information, then we end up with the
<br>
issue of who determines bias again (and it is even more subjective than
<br>
danger determination, and hence more open to abuse). Besides, my website
<br>
- is it personal speech or mass media? The lines have been blurred. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I oppose giving the media access during specific phases of military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operations as an example.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the media has a right to participate in a military
<br>
operation, and if I ran one I might very well consider not helping them
<br>
get any sensitive information. But if they managed to dig up information
<br>
on their own, I don't think trying to silence them is a good idea -
<br>
maybe they could be persuaded not to release it (a voluntary
<br>
transaction), perhaps in exchange for some nice shots (seems to be CNN's
<br>
approach). Of course, here we enter the messy issues of valid uses of
<br>
coercion - a military force set to protect a society might have a valid
<br>
claim to certain forms of internal coercion in order to achieve
<br>
societally agreed goals - but in this case there are news sources from
<br>
*different* societies, many of which are not directly involved in the
<br>
war. That makes coercing them a bad idea.
