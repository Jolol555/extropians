<p>If you are after a near earth asteroid and are using robots then
<br>
you might not need to snag the rock at all for the beginning
<br>
extraction and refining and hollowing out some habitation
<br>
space.  When the work has preceded for a while and the rock
<br>
returns to its nearest point might be the time to send out a
<br>
human team.  Meanwhile this rock is now sporting some refined
<br>
metals and volatiles useful for further space operations and
<br>
building up more structures.  The market for these things is in
<br>
orbit rather than on the ground.  How much is extended
<br>
structure, material, fuel and habitation already in space worth
<br>
to would be space enterprise?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Keeping 'em up there becomes more feasable for the later asteroids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But we need to get from here to there before we're there.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I think keeping the materials up there is quite
<br>
feasible for the first asteroid or two.  Only ship to Earth high
<br>
value minerals that you don't have much pragmatic use for in
<br>
orbit.
