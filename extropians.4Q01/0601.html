<p>Science is a formalized tool that reflects a greater whole - for example,
<br>
the experimental method reflects (among other things) the Bayesian
<br>
Probability Theorem.  I don't need magic to know whether or not I'm
<br>
happy.  There's a certain subjective sensation I call happiness, and it's
<br>
not exactly hard to tell whether it's present, and at what intensity, and
<br>
why.  The question I ask myself ultimately reflects a physical fact about
<br>
my brain-state, and an external observer who wanted a definite answer to
<br>
the question could find one.  If I were confused about the definition, an
<br>
external observer could discover everything there was to know about the
<br>
confusion.
<br>
<p>Not everything involves controlled experimental studies, but that's
<br>
because controlled experimental studies aren't always necessary to find
<br>
simple answers to routine questions.  It doesn't mean that there's
<br>
something outside of science.  I don't use a scientific methodology to
<br>
determine whether I'm happy for the same reason I don't use a scientific
<br>
methodology to determine where I left my wristwatch; it would be
<br>
overkill.  It doesn't mean that the location of my wristwatch is a deep
<br>
truth that science can never comprehend.
<br>
<p>Asking an ambiguous or observer-dependent question does not mean that the
<br>
underlying reality is uncertain or subjective.  It doesn't even mean that
<br>
the question is outside of science.  If science can precisely describe the
<br>
ambiguity or the observer-dependency, science can combine that description
<br>
with the description of reality to yield the best available answer to the
<br>
question.
