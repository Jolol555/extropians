<p>Britain releases dossier of evidence
<br>
<p>Blair: ‘We have absolutely no doubt’ bin Laden was behind Sept. 11 attacks
<br>
<p>Oct. 4 —  Following up on a tough-worded speech warning Afghanistan of an 
<br>
impending military attack, British Prime Minister Tony Blair revealed 
<br>
details Thursday of the case against Osama bin Laden, saying three hijackers 
<br>
have been “positively identified” as associates and that the terror suspect 
<br>
told others he was preparing a major strike against the United States. The 
<br>
evidence was later released in a dossier by the British government
<br>
<p>Asked in Washington about the British dossier, State Department spokesman 
<br>
Richard Boucher said, “I don’t have any reservations about the British 
<br>
paper. But I’m not able to offer U.S. information or endorsement of specific 
<br>
facts.”
<br>
<p>Bush administration officials presented what was said to be similar evidence 
<br>
to NATO allies in Brussels on Tuesday and to Pakistan, which neighbors 
<br>
Afghanistan and has relations with that country’s ruling Taliban militia.
<br>
<p>After seeing the evidence, Pakistan’s government announced there was enough 
<br>
proof to justify putting bin Laden on trial.
<br>
<p>“We have seen the material that was provided to us by the American side 
<br>
yesterday. This material certainly provides sufficient basis for indictment 
<br>
in a court of law,” foreign ministry spokesman Riaz Mohammad Khan told a 
<br>
news conference.
<br>
<p>In Paris, French President Jacques Chirac said that “everything points to 
<br>
Osama bin Laden and his networks as the authors of these attacks.”

<p>Oct. 4: Text of British document
<br>
<p>Summary of evidence against Osama bin Laden
<br>
<p>ASSOCIATED PRESS
<br>
<p>LONDON, Oct. 4 — The following is the full text of the summary of evidence 
<br>
against Osama bin Laden in U.S. terrorist attacks, released Thursday by the 
<br>
British government:
<br>
<p>RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERRORIST ATROCITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, 11 
<br>
SEPTEMBER 2001
<br>
<p><p>INTRODUCTION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The clear conclusions reached by the government are: Osama bin 
<br>
Laden and al-Qaida, the terrorist network which he heads, planned and 
<br>
carried out the atrocities on 11 September 2001; Osama bin Laden and 
<br>
al-Qaida retain the will and resources to carry out further atrocities; the 
<br>
United Kingdom, and United Kingdom nationals are potential targets; and 
<br>
Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida were able to commit these atrocities because of 
<br>
their close alliance with the Taliban regime, which allowed them to operate 
<br>
with impunity in pursuing their terrorist activity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The material in respect of 1998 and the USS Cole comes from 
<br>
indictments and intelligence sources. The material in respect of 11 
<br>
September comes from intelligence and the criminal investigation to date. 
<br>
The details of some aspects cannot be given, but the facts are clear from 
<br>
the intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The document does not contain the totality of the material known 
<br>
to Her Majesty’s Government, given the continuing and absolute need to 
<br>
protect intelligence sources.
<br>
<p><p>SUMMARY
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The relevant facts show:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Background
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al-Qaida is a terrorist organization with ties to a global network, 
<br>
which has been in existence for over 10 years. It was founded, and has been 
<br>
led at all times, by Osama bin Laden.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida have been engaged in a jihad against the 
<br>
United States, and its allies. One of their stated aims is the murder of 
<br>
U.S. citizens, and attacks on America’s allies.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida have been based in Afghanistan since 
<br>
1996, but have a network of operations throughout the world. The network 
<br>
includes training camps, warehouses, communication facilities and commercial 
<br>
operations able to raise significant sums of money to support its activity. 
<br>
That activity includes substantial exploitation of the illegal drugs trade 
<br>
from Afghanistan.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida and the Taliban regime have a close and 
<br>
mutually dependent alliance. Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida provide the 
<br>
Taliban regime with material, financial and military support. They jointly 
<br>
exploit the drugs trade. The Taliban regime allows bin Laden to operate his 
<br>
terrorist training camps and activities from Afghanistan, protects him from 
<br>
attacks from outside, and protects the drugs stockpiles. Osama bin Laden 
<br>
could not operate his terrorist activities without the alliance and support 
<br>
of the Taliban regime. The Taliban’s strength would be seriously weakened 
<br>
without Osama bin Laden’s military and financial support.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida have the capability to execute major 
<br>
terrorist attacks.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osama bin Laden has claimed credit for the attack on U.S. soldiers in 
<br>
Somalia in October 1993, which killed 18; for the attack on the U.S. 
<br>
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998 which killed 224 and injured 
<br>
nearly 5,000; and were linked to the attack on the USS Cole on 12 October 
<br>
2000, in which 17 crew members were killed and 40 others injured.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have sought to acquire nuclear and chemical materials for use as 
<br>
terrorist weapons.
<br>
<p>IN RELATION TO THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON 11 SEPTEMBER
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. After 11 September we learned that, not long before, bin Laden had 
<br>
indicated he was about to launch a major attack on America. The detailed 
<br>
planning for the terrorist attacks of 11 September was carried out by one of 
<br>
Osama bin Laden’s close associates. Of the 19 hijackers involved in 11 
<br>
September 2001, it has already been established that at least three had 
<br>
links with al-Qaida. The attacks on 11 September 2001 were similar in both 
<br>
their ambition and intended impact to previous attacks undertaken by Osama 
<br>
bin Laden and al-Qaida, and also had features in common. In particular:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suicide attackers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Coordinated attacks on the same day
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The aim to cause maximum American casualties
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Total disregard for other casualties, including Muslim
<br>
<p>METICULOUS LONG-TERM PLANNING
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Absence of warning.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Al-Qaida retains the capability and the will to make further 
<br>
attacks on the U.S. and its allies, including the United Kingdom.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Al-Qaida gives no warning of terrorist attack.
<br>
<p><p>THE FACTS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. In 1989 Osama bin Laden, and others, founded an international 
<br>
terrorist group known as “al-Qaida” (the Base). At all times he has been the 
<br>
leader of al-Qaida.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. From 1989 until 1991 Osama bin Laden was based in Afghanistan and 
<br>
Peshawar, Pakistan. In 1991 he moved to Sudan, where he stayed until 1996. 
<br>
In that year he returned to Afghanistan, where he remains.
<br>
<p>THE TALIBAN REGIME
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Taliban emerged from the Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan in 
<br>
the early 1990s. By 1996 they had captured Kabul. They are still engaged in 
<br>
a bloody civil war to control the whole of Afghanistan. They are led by 
<br>
Mullah Omar.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. In 1996 Osama Bin Laden moved back to Afghanistan. He established 
<br>
a close relationship with Mullah Omar, and threw his support behind the 
<br>
Taliban. Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban regime have a close alliance on 
<br>
which both depend for their continued existence. They also share the same 
<br>
religious values and vision.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Osama bin Laden has provided the Taliban regime with troops, arms 
<br>
and money to fight the Northern Alliance. He is closely involved with 
<br>
Taliban military training, planning and operations. He has representatives 
<br>
in the Taliban military command structure. He has also given infrastructure 
<br>
assistance and humanitarian aid. Forces under the control of Osama bin Laden 
<br>
have fought alongside the Taliban in the civil war in Afghanistan.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Omar has provided bin Laden with a safe haven in which to 
<br>
operate, and has allowed him to establish terrorist training camps in 
<br>
Afghanistan. They jointly exploit the Afghan drugs trade. In return for 
<br>
active al-Qaida support, the Taliban allow al-Qaida to operate freely, 
<br>
including planning, training and preparing for terrorist activity. In 
<br>
addition the Taliban provide security for the stockpiles of drugs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Since 1996, when the Taliban captured Kabul, the United States 
<br>
government has consistently raised with them a whole range of issues, 
<br>
including humanitarian aid and terrorism. Well before 11 September 2001 they 
<br>
had provided evidence to the Taliban of the responsibility of al-Qaida for 
<br>
the terrorist attacks in East Africa. This evidence had been provided to 
<br>
senior leaders of the Taliban at their request.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. The United States government had made it clear to the Taliban 
<br>
regime that al-Qaida had murdered US citizens, and planned to murder more. 
<br>
The US offered to work with the Taliban to expel the terrorists from 
<br>
Afghanistan. These talks, which have been continuing since 1996, have failed 
<br>
to produce any results.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. In June 2001, in the face of mounting evidence of the al-Qaida 
<br>
threat, the United States warned the Taliban that it had the right to defend 
<br>
itself and that it would hold the regime responsible for attacks against 
<br>
U.S. citizens by terrorists sheltered in Afghanistan.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. In this, the United States had the support of the United Nations. 
<br>
The Security Council, in Resolution 1267, condemned Osama bin Laden for 
<br>
sponsoring international terrorism and operating a network of terrorist 
<br>
camps, and demanded that the Taliban surrender Osama bin Laden without 
<br>
further delay so that he could be brought to justice.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. Despite the evidence provided by the U.S. of the responsibility 
<br>
of Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida for the 1998 East Africa bombings, despite 
<br>
the accurately perceived threats of further atrocities, and despite the 
<br>
demands of the United Nations, the Taliban regime responded by saying no 
<br>
evidence existed against Osama bin Laden, and that neither he nor his 
<br>
network would be expelled.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. A former Government official in Afghanistan has described the 
<br>
Taliban and Osama bin Laden as “two sides of the same coin: Osama cannot 
<br>
exist in Afghanistan without the Taliban and the Taliban cannot exist 
<br>
without Osama.”
<br>
<p>AL-QAIDA
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. Al-Qaida is dedicated to opposing ’un-Islamic’ governments in 
<br>
Muslim countries with force and violence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. Al-Qaida virulently opposes the United States. Osama bin Laden 
<br>
has urged and incited his followers to kill American citizens, in the most 
<br>
unequivocal terms.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. On 12 October 1996 he issued a declaration of jihad as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The people of Islam have suffered from aggression, iniquity and 
<br>
injustice imposed by the Zionist-Crusader alliance and their collaborators. 
<br>
...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the duty now on every tribe in the Arabian peninsula to fight 
<br>
jihad and cleanse the land from these Crusader occupiers. Their wealth is 
<br>
booty to those who kill them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Muslim brothers: your brothers in Palestine and in the land of the 
<br>
two Holy Places (i.e. Saudi Arabia) are calling upon your help and asking 
<br>
you to take part in fighting against the enemy the Americans and the 
<br>
Israelis. They are asking you to do whatever you can to expel the enemies 
<br>
out of the sanctities of Islam.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in the same year he said that “terrorizing the American 
<br>
occupiers (of Islamic Holy Places) is a religious and logical obligation.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1998 he issued and signed a ’fatwa’ which included a 
<br>
decree to all Muslims: ”... the killing of Americans and their civilian and 
<br>
military allies is a religious duty for each and every Muslim to be carried 
<br>
out in whichever country they are until Al Aqsa mosque has been liberated 
<br>
from their grasp and until their armies have left Muslim lands.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same ’fatwa’ he called on Muslim scholars and their leaders 
<br>
and their youths to “launch an attack on the American soldiers of Satan” and 
<br>
concluded: “We with God’s help call on every Muslim who believes in God and 
<br>
wishes to be rewarded to comply with God’s order to kill Americans and 
<br>
plunder their money whenever and wherever they find it. We also call on 
<br>
Muslims ... to launch the raid on Satan’s U.S. troops and the devil’s 
<br>
supporters allying with them, and to displace those who are behind them.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked, in 1998, about obtaining chemical or nuclear weapons he 
<br>
said “acquiring such weapons for the defense of Muslims (was) a religious 
<br>
duty.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an interview aired on Al Jazira (Doha, Qatar) television he 
<br>
stated: “Our enemy is every American male, whether he is directly fighting 
<br>
us or paying taxes.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two interviews broadcast on US television in 1997 and 1998 he 
<br>
referred to the terrorists who carried out the earlier attack on the World 
<br>
Trade Center in 1993 as “role models”. He went on to exhort his followers 
<br>
“to take the fighting to America.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. From the early 1990s Osama bin Laden has sought to obtain nuclear 
<br>
and chemical materials for use as weapons of terror.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. Although U.S. targets are al-Qaida’s priority, it also explicitly 
<br>
threatens the United States’ allies. References to “Zionist-Crusader 
<br>
alliance and their collaborators,” and to “Satan’s U.S. troops and the 
<br>
devil’s supporters allying with them” are references which unquestionably 
<br>
include the United Kingdom.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. There is a continuing threat. Based on our experience of the way 
<br>
the network has operated in the past, other cells, like those that carried 
<br>
out the terrorist attacks on 11 September, must be assumed to exist.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. Al-Qaida functions both on its own and through a network of other 
<br>
terrorist organizations. These include Egyptian Islamic Jihad and other 
<br>
north African Islamic extremist terrorist groups, and a number of other 
<br>
jihadi groups in other countries including the Sudan, Yemen, Somalia, 
<br>
Pakistan and India. Al-Qaida also maintains cells and personnel in a number 
<br>
of other countries to facilitate its activities.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27. Osama bin Laden heads the al-Qaida network. Below him is a body 
<br>
known as the Shura, which includes representatives of other terrorist 
<br>
groups, such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad leader Ayman al-Zawahri and prominent 
<br>
lieutenants of bin Laden such as Abu Hafas al-Masri. Egyptian Islamic Jihad 
<br>
has, in effect, merged with al-Qaida.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. In addition to the Shura, al-Qaida has several groups dealing 
<br>
with military, media, financial and Islamic issues.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. Mohamed Atef is a member of the group that deals with military 
<br>
and terrorist operations. His duties include principal responsibility for 
<br>
training al-Qaida members.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30. Members of al-Qaida must make a pledge of allegiance to follow 
<br>
the orders of Osama bin Laden.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. A great deal of evidence about Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida has 
<br>
been made available in the US indictment for earlier crimes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. Since 1989, Osama bin Laden has conducted substantial financial 
<br>
and business transactions on behalf of al-Qaida and in pursuit of its goals. 
<br>
These include purchasing land for training camps, purchasing warehouses for 
<br>
the storage of items, including explosives, purchasing communications and 
<br>
electronics equipment, and transporting currency and weapons to members of 
<br>
al-Qaida and associated terrorist groups in countries throughout the world.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. Since 1989 Osama bin Laden has provided training camps and 
<br>
guesthouses in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Sudan, Somalia and Kenya for the 
<br>
use of al-Qaida and associated terrorist groups. We know from intelligence 
<br>
that there are currently at least a dozen camps across Afghanistan, of which 
<br>
at least four are used for training terrorists.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. Since 1989, Osama bin Laden has established a series of 
<br>
businesses to provide income for al-Qaida, and to provide cover for the 
<br>
procurement of explosives, weapons and chemicals, and for the travel of 
<br>
al-Qaida operatives. The businesses have included a holding company known as 
<br>
’Wadi Al Aqiq,’ a construction business known as ’Al Hijra,’ an agricultural 
<br>
business known as ’Al Themar Al Mubaraka,’ and investment companies known as 
<br>
’Ladin International’ and ’Taba Investments.’
<br>
<p>OSAMA BIN LADEN AND PREVIOUS ATTACKS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. In 1992 and 1993 Mohamed Atef traveled to Somalia on several 
<br>
occasions for the purpose of organizing violence against United States and 
<br>
United Nations troops then stationed in Somalia. On each occasion he 
<br>
reported back to Osama bin Laden, at his base in the Riyadh district of 
<br>
Khartoum.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36. In the spring of 1993 Atef, Saif al Adel, another senior member 
<br>
of al-Qaida, and other members began to provide military training to Somali 
<br>
tribes for the purpose of fighting the United Nations forces.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. On 3 and 4 October 1993 operatives of al-Qaida participated in 
<br>
the attack on US military personnel serving in Somalia as part of the 
<br>
operation ’Restore Hope.’ Eighteen U.S. military personnel were killed in 
<br>
the attack.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38. From 1993 members of al-Qaida began to live in Nairobi and set up 
<br>
businesses there, including Asma Ltd, and Tanzanite King. They were 
<br>
regularly visited there by senior members of al-Qaida, in particular by Atef 
<br>
and Abu Ubadiah al Banshiri.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;39. Beginning in the latter part of 1993, members of al-Qaida in 
<br>
Kenya began to discuss the possibility of attacking the U.S. Embassy in 
<br>
Nairobi in retaliation for U.S. participation in Operation Restore Hope in 
<br>
Somalia. Ali Mohamed, a U.S. citizen and admitted member of al-Qaida, 
<br>
surveyed the US Embassy as a possible target for a terrorist attack. He took 
<br>
photographs and made sketches, which he presented to Osama bin Laden while 
<br>
bin Laden was in Sudan. He also admitted that he had trained terrorists for 
<br>
al-Qaida in Afghanistan in the early 1990s, and that those whom he trained 
<br>
included many involved in the East African bombings in August 1998.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40. In June or July 1998, two al-Qaida operatives, Fahid Mohammed, 
<br>
Ali Msalam and Sheik Ahmed Salim Swedan, purchased a Toyota truck and made 
<br>
various alterations to the back of the truck.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;41. In early August 1998, operatives of al-Qaida gathered in 43, New 
<br>
Runda Estates, Nairobi to execute the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 
<br>
Nairobi.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42. On 7 August 1998, Assam, a Saudi national and al-Qaida operative, 
<br>
drove the Toyota truck to the U.S. embassy. There was a large bomb in the 
<br>
back of the truck.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;43. Also in the truck was Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al ’Owali, another 
<br>
Saudi. He, by his own confession, was an al-Qaida operative, who from about 
<br>
1996 had been trained in al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan in explosives, 
<br>
hijacking, kidnapping, assassination and intelligence techniques. With Osama 
<br>
bin Laden’s express permission, he fought alongside the Taliban in 
<br>
Afghanistan. He had met Osama bin Laden personally in 1996 and asked for 
<br>
another ’mission.’ Osama bin Laden sent him to East Africa after extensive 
<br>
specialized training at camps in Afghanistan.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. As the truck approached the Embassy, Al ’Owali got out and threw 
<br>
a stun grenade at a security guard. Assam drove the truck up to the rear of 
<br>
the embassy. He got out and then detonated the bomb, which demolished a 
<br>
multi-story secretarial college and severely damaged the U.S. embassy, and 
<br>
the Co-operative bank building. The bomb killed 213 people and injured 
<br>
4,500. Assam was killed in the explosion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45. Al ’Owali expected the mission to end in his death. He had been 
<br>
willing to die for al-Qaida. But at the last minute he ran away from the 
<br>
bomb truck and survived. He had no money, passport or plan to escape after 
<br>
the mission, because he had expected to die.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46. After a few days, he called a telephone number in Yemen to have 
<br>
money transferred to him in Kenya. The number he rang in Yemen was contacted 
<br>
by Osama bin Laden’s phone on the same day as Al ’Owali was arranging to get 
<br>
the money.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47. Another person arrested in connection with the Nairobi bombing 
<br>
was Mohamed Sadeek Odeh. He admitted to his involvement. He identified the 
<br>
principal participants in the bombing. He named three other persons, all of 
<br>
whom were al-Qaida or Egyptian Islamic Jihad members.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48. In Dar es Salaam the same day, at about the same time, operatives 
<br>
of al-Qaida detonated a bomb at the U.S. embassy, killing 11 people. The 
<br>
al-Qaida operatives involved included Mustafa Mohamed Fadhil and Khaflan 
<br>
Khamis Mohamed. The bomb was carried in a Nissan Atlas truck, which Ahmed 
<br>
Khfaklan Ghailani and Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan, two al-Qaida operatives, 
<br>
had purchased in July 1998, in Dar es Salaam.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49. Khaflan Khamis Mohamed was arrested for the bombing. He admitted 
<br>
membership of al-Qaida, and implicated other members of al-Qaida in the 
<br>
bombing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50. On 7 and 8 August 1998, two other members of al-Qaida 
<br>
disseminated claims of responsibility for the two bombings by sending faxes 
<br>
to media organizations in Paris, Doha in Qatar, and Dubai in the United Arab 
<br>
Emirates.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51. Additional evidence of the involvement of al-Qaida in the East 
<br>
African bombings came from a search conducted in London of several 
<br>
residences and businesses belonging to al-Qaida and Egyptian Islamic Jihad 
<br>
members. In those searches a number of documents were found including claims 
<br>
of responsibility for the East African bombings in the name of a fictitious 
<br>
group, ’the Islamic Army for the liberation of the Holy Places.’
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52. Al ’Owali, the would-be suicide bomber, admitted he was told to 
<br>
make a videotape of himself using the name of the same fictitious group.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53. The faxed claims of responsibility were traced to a telephone 
<br>
number, which had been in contact with Osama bin Laden’s cell phone. The 
<br>
claims disseminated to the press were clearly written by someone familiar 
<br>
with the conspiracy. They stated that the bombings had been carried out by 
<br>
two Saudis in Kenya, and one Egyptian in Dar es Salaam. They were probably 
<br>
sent before the bombings had even taken place. They referred to two Saudis 
<br>
dying in the Nairobi attack. In fact, because Al ’Owali fled at the last 
<br>
minute, only one Saudi died.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. On 22 December 1998 Osama bin Laden was asked by Time magazine 
<br>
whether he was responsible for the August 1998 attacks. He replied: “The 
<br>
International Islamic Jihad Front for the jihad against the U.S. and Israel 
<br>
has, by the grace of God, issued a crystal clear fatwa calling on the 
<br>
Islamic nation to carry on Jihad aimed at liberating the holy sites. The 
<br>
nation of Mohammed has responded to this appeal. If instigation for jihad 
<br>
against the Jews and the Americans ... is considered to be a crime, then let 
<br>
history be a witness that I am a criminal. Our job is to instigate and, by 
<br>
the grace of God, we did that, and certain people responded to this 
<br>
instigation.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was asked if he knew the attackers: ”... those who risked their 
<br>
lives to earn the pleasure of God are real men. They managed to rid the 
<br>
Islamic nation of disgrace. We hold them in the highest esteem.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what the U.S. could expect of him: ”... any thief or criminal who 
<br>
enters another country to steal should expect to be exposed to murder at any 
<br>
time. ... The U.S. knows that I have attacked it, by the grace of God, for 
<br>
more than ten years now. ... God knows that we have been pleased by the 
<br>
killing of American soldiers (in Somalia in 1993). This was achieved by the 
<br>
grace of God and the efforts of the mujahedeen. ... Hostility toward America 
<br>
is a religious duty and we hope to be rewarded for it by God. I am confident 
<br>
that Muslims will be able to end the legend of the so-called superpower that 
<br>
is America.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55. In December 1999 a terrorist cell linked to al-Qaida was 
<br>
discovered trying to carry out attacks inside the United States. An 
<br>
Algerian, Ahmed Ressam, was stopped at the U.S.-Canadian border and over 100 
<br>
lbs of bomb making material was found in his car. Ressam admitted he was 
<br>
planning to set off a large bomb at Los Angeles International airport on New 
<br>
Year’s Day. He said that he had received terrorist training at al-Qaida 
<br>
camps in Afghanistan and then been instructed to go abroad and kill US 
<br>
civilians and military personnel.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56. On 3 January 2000, a group of al-Qaida members, and other 
<br>
terrorists who had trained in al-Qaida camps in Afghanistan, attempted to 
<br>
attack a U.S. destroyer with a small boat loaded with explosives. Their boat 
<br>
sank, aborting the attack.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57. On 12 October 2000, however, the USS Cole was struck by an 
<br>
explosive-laden boat while refueling in Aden harbor. Seventeen crew were 
<br>
killed, and 40 injured.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58. Several of the perpetrators of the Cole attack (mostly Yemenis 
<br>
and Saudis) were trained at Osama bin Laden’s camps in Afghanistan. Al 
<br>
’Owali has identified the two commanders of the attack on the USS Cole as 
<br>
having participated in the planning and preparation for the East African 
<br>
embassy bombings.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59. In the months before the September 11 attacks, propaganda videos 
<br>
were distributed throughout the Middle East and Muslim world by al-Qaida, in 
<br>
which Osama bin Laden and others were shown encouraging Muslims to attack 
<br>
American and Jewish targets.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60. Similar videos, extolling violence against the United States and 
<br>
other targets, were distributed before the East African embassy attacks in 
<br>
August 1998.
<br>
<p>OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE 11 SEPTEMBER ATTACKS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61. Nineteen men have been identified as the hijackers from the 
<br>
passenger lists of the four planes hijacked on 11 September 2001. At least 
<br>
three of them have already been positively identified as associates of 
<br>
al-Qaida. One has been identified as playing key roles in both the East 
<br>
African embassy attacks and the USS Cole attack. Investigations continue 
<br>
into the backgrounds of all the hijackers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62. From intelligence sources, the following facts have been 
<br>
established subsequent to 11 September; for intelligence reasons, the names 
<br>
of associates, though known, are not given.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the run-up to 11 September, bin Laden was mounting a concerted 
<br>
propaganda campaign amongst like-minded groups of people including videos 
<br>
and documentation justifying attacks on Jewish and American targets; and 
<br>
claiming that those who died in the course of them were carrying out God’s 
<br>
work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have learned, subsequent to 11 September, that bin Laden himself 
<br>
asserted shortly before 11 September that he was preparing a major attack on 
<br>
America.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August and early September close associates of bin Laden were 
<br>
warned to return to Afghanistan from other parts of the world by 10 
<br>
September.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately prior to 11 September some known associates of bin Laden 
<br>
were naming the date for action as on or around 11 September.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 11 September we have learned that one of bin Laden’s closest 
<br>
and most senior associates was responsible for the detailed planning of the 
<br>
attacks.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is evidence of a very specific nature relating to the guilt of 
<br>
bin Laden and his associates that is too sensitive to release.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63. Osama bin Laden remains in charge, and the mastermind, of 
<br>
al-Qaida. In al-Qaida, an operation on the scale of the 11 September attacks 
<br>
would have been approved by Osama bin Laden himself.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64. The modus operandi of 11 September was entirely consistent with 
<br>
previous attacks. Al-Qaida’s record of atrocities is characterized by 
<br>
meticulous long term planning, a desire to inflict mass casualties, suicide 
<br>
bombers, and multiple simultaneous attacks.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65. The attacks of 11 September 2001 are entirely consistent with the 
<br>
scale and sophistication of the planning which went into the attacks on the 
<br>
East African Embassies and the USS Cole. No warnings were given for these 
<br>
three attacks, just as there was none on 11 September.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66. Al-Qaida operatives, in evidence given in the East African 
<br>
Embassy bomb trials, have described how the group spends years preparing for 
<br>
an attack. They conduct repeated surveillance, patiently gather materials, 
<br>
and identify and vet operatives, who have the skills to participate in the 
<br>
attack and the willingness to die for their cause.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67. The operatives involved in the 11 September atrocities attended 
<br>
flight schools, used flight simulators to study the controls of larger 
<br>
aircraft and placed potential airports and routes under surveillance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68. Al-Qaida’s attacks are characterized by total disregard for 
<br>
innocent lives, including Muslims. In an interview after the East African 
<br>
bombings, Osama bin Laden insisted that the need to attack the United States 
<br>
excused the killing of other innocent civilians, Muslim and non-Muslim 
<br>
alike.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69. No other organization has both the motivation and the capability 
<br>
to carry out attacks like those of the 11 September only the al-Qaida 
<br>
network under Osama bin Laden.
<br>
<p>CONCLUSION
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;70. The attacks of the 11 September 2001 were planned and carried out 
<br>
by al-Qaida, an organization whose head is Osama bin Laden. That 
<br>
organization has the will, and the resources, to execute further attacks of 
<br>
similar scale. Both the United States and its close allies are targets for 
<br>
such attacks. The attack could not have occurred without the alliance 
<br>
between the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, which allowed bin Laden to operate 
<br>
freely in Afghanistan, promoting, planning and executing terrorist
