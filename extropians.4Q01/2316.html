&quot;In just four years, and with $50 million, the Pentagon plans to create a
<br>
wearable, self-propelled robotic suit that responds to - and amplifies -
<br>
your every movement. By simply strapping themselves into this &quot;exoskeleton&quot;,
<br>
troops will be able to run faster, jump higher, leap further,&quot;
<br>
<p>I just wanted to make some comments about this concept.  I have been
<br>
investigating something similiar for quite sometime and I think the future
<br>
implications of such a 'suit' whether external or internal, are important to
<br>
consider.  Mainly, since most of us on this list would like to see aging and
<br>
disease defeated and be physiological immortal, a whole new realm of things
<br>
will then become the enemy of lives, namely accidents.  Wearing a protective
<br>
suit would thus radically minimize the chance of death caused by accidental
<br>
injury.  In our meager short lives we dont much consider the chance of death
<br>
by falling rocks, car accidents, or even asteroid impacts.  A powered
<br>
armored suit that also contains an environmental sealed (think SCUBA dry
<br>
suits combined with powered armored exoskeletons) and the human biosphere
<br>
just radically increased, from the surface of mars to deep sea excursions.
<br>
<p>Beings who do not age will have much vaster things to worry about that may
<br>
kill them, stellar events, very rare accidents, etc. etc.  Anything that
<br>
decreases those chances increases the life span of the individual.  I think
<br>
in the far future, most beings will have these suits of some sort and stay
<br>
inside of them most of the time.  They need not be uncomfortable either, as
<br>
they can easily emulate tactile sensations and the full range of human
<br>
movement.  Be interesting to see where this goes once immortality and
<br>
capitalism start to tug at it.

<br>
To be a member of the US Special Forces you need to be a crack soldier
<br>
with superior physical and mental abilities. But that's today.
<br>
Tomorrow's soldier will have to be superhuman - to be able to jog along
<br>
effortlessly at 13 kilometres per hour carrying a 70-kilogram load for
<br>
12 hours at a stretch. For anyone wearing the right clothes, however,
<br>
this shouldn't prove too much of a problem. In just four years, and with
<br>
$50 million, the Pentagon plans to create a wearable, self-propelled
<br>
robotic suit that responds to - and amplifies - your every movement. By
<br>
simply strapping themselves into this &quot;exoskeleton&quot;, troops will be able
<br>
to run faster, jump higher, leap further, and carry awesome amounts of
<br>
high-calibre weaponry. We take a look at the &quot;garment&quot; that as well as
<br>
turning your average GI into a heavyweight fighting machine, could also
<br>
revolutionise the lives of disabled people and those working as
<br>
firefighters or in construction, mining and heavy industries.
<br>
Read the full feature in New Scientist magazine
<br>
AND FINALLY...
<br>
Some describe how a wave of sympathy washes over them whenever they see
<br>
a road sign referring to a &quot;depressed bridge&quot;. Others confess that they
<br>
feel strangely moved by the mere mention of an &quot;alarmed door&quot; or
<br>
&quot;nervous tissue&quot;. These people are suffering from semiopathy. This
<br>
week's Feedback column examines a debilitating condition which compels
<br>
its victims to over-empathise with objects...
