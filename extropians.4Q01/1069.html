<p>I think the tissues with rapidly dividing cells *do* contribute
<br>
to some aspects of aging.  As an increasing fraction of the cells
<br>
shut down due to telomere shortening they would accumulate in the
<br>
scenescent state.  Presumably they then begin to accumulate waste
<br>
products (lipofuscin that is normally diluted out in cells that
<br>
divide) and mutations (because you don't go through the DNA repair
<br>
cycle that occurs when you replicate the DNA).  This does show
<br>
up in things like poor nutrient absorption in the gut, a decline
<br>
in the immune system and decreasing ability of the skin to
<br>
resist injuries or heal.
<br>
<p>Postmitotic cell attrition in the brain *will* be a problem but
<br>
it probably doesn't become significant until 200+ years.  We
<br>
will have to develop methods of spuring the neuronal stem
<br>
cells to replace those lost and/or inducing greater plasticity
<br>
for those remaining.
<br>
<p>In the skeletal muscle and myocardium its partially a cell loss
<br>
problem (apoptosis, perhaps induced by mitochondrial loss),
<br>
partially a neuronal problem (the signals don't propagate
<br>
as well to the muscle cells), and partially an accumulation
<br>
of waste products (e.g. lipofuscin) that diminish cell function.
<br>
<p>We know nuclear mutations occur in dividing cells that lead to cancer.
<br>
What we don't have a good handle on is how mutations in non-dividing
<br>
cells effect their function.  Do they cause the cells to commit
<br>
apoptosis?  Do they cause dedifferentation of the cell so it
<br>
simply doesn't perform its natural function as well?  It isn't
<br>
clear at this point though work is being done in mice to determine
<br>
the mutation rates and types in non-dividing tissues.  So we
<br>
should have some ideas about this in the not-to-distant future.
<br>
<p>There are at least 2 solutions for mitochondrial aging:
<br>
(a) to finish the job nature has been doing of moving the mitochondrial
<br>
genome into the nucleus where it is better protected (Aubrey has proposed
<br>
methods of doing this); (b) to develop a more robust DNA repair system
<br>
for the mitochondria (presumably similar to that found in the nucleus).
<br>
I think there is a fairly active debate about whether the mitochondria
<br>
have no DNA repair system (as used to be thought) or one that is
<br>
simply fairly poor.
