<p>That is a very neat idea Alex. Many in the legal profession might oppose it 
<br>
on the grounds that going over the innumerable laws again and again would 
<br>
be like walking into quicksand. But I wonder if this might not *finally* be 
<br>
a way to prune back unnecessarily complex laws and get them redrafted into 
<br>
common language. People becoming weary of all these densely worded archaic 
<br>
laws might become impatient with them and force modernisation.
<br>
<p>There is, on the other hand, a danger that people would relinquish the task 
<br>
of reviewing the laws, preferring that &quot;the experts&quot; do it for them. 
<br>
Corporate bullies and bureaucrats could then be expected to use this 
<br>
opportunity to the detriment of the ordinary folk... except where powerful 
<br>
people with good conscience worked for honest justice. The trouble with 
<br>
relying upon powerful people is that many of them have that power because 
<br>
they are motivated to gain power for its own sake rather than because they 
<br>
want to use power for common good.
<br>
<p>On the subject of the mistake of giving corporations individual rights, I 
<br>
was reading about some of what Abraham Lincoln said. He was quite upset 
<br>
about corporations becoming defacto humans. What he said made great sense.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

To the optimist, the glass is half full.

To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.

To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
