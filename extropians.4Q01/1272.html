Mike asked:
<br>
<p>Anothuh Mainuh? What paht of Maine did he live in?
<br>
<p>Here is more than you probably want to know:
<br>
<p>1.  CAPT. THOMAS BRADBURY was born 2/28/1609-10, baptized 2/28/1611
<br>
in Wicken-Bonant, Essex Co., England, and died 3/16/1694-95 in Salisbury,
<br>
MA.  He married MARY PERKINS 5/1636 in Salisbury, MA, daughter of JOHN
<br>
PERKINS and JUDITH GATER.  She was born Abt. 1620,  baptized 9/3/1615  in
<br>
Hillmorton, Warwickshire, Eng., and died 12/20/1700 in Salisbury, MA.
<br>
<p>Notes for CAPT. THOMAS BRADBURY:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas came to Maine probably in  1634 on an unknown ship probably
<br>
out of Bristol, owned or chartered by his grand uncle Sir Ferdinando
<br>
Gorges who resided there. Thomas was in London 1 May 1634 and in New
<br>
England by 5 May 1636. He probably lived  on Gorges Point in a house built
<br>
by a previous administrator, Richard Vines. He is listed as one of the
<br>
original grantees of Salisbury, MA in 1639 and probably moved from York,
<br>
ME (Agamenticus) to Salisbury, MA about 1638.  He lived there on Mudnuck
<br>
road and Mary stayed there eight years after his death. The birth dates of
<br>
his first two children is given as York, ME so he evidently didn't move to
<br>
Salisbury until after 1638. Some of the birth data of Thomas's children
<br>
in &quot;Old Times in North Yarmouth&quot; by C. F. Banks are different from those
<br>
in the &quot;Bradbury Memorial.&quot; The only graves to be found in the Olde
<br>
Burying Ground in Salisbury  are those of Thomas, which is badly
<br>
deteriorated, and his grandsons Jacob and Thomas and Thomas's wife Mary.
<br>
The graves of sons Thomas, William, John and Jabez have not been found. It
<br>
is possible that they moved and are buried elsewhere.
<br>
<p>All I've got to say is an 84 and 80 year longevities has to be
<br>
really exceptional in the 1600s.  One has to wonder if in the
<br>
early days of America there was not an caloric restriction
<br>
effect due to how hard one probably had to work relative to
<br>
the food available.
<br>
<p>(In reading this I notice some logical date errors I'm going to
<br>
have to ask my father about, so you don't have to point them
<br>
out to me).
<br>
<p>Robert
