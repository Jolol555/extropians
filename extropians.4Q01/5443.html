<em>&gt; I don't experience the Google decrease in efficiency. To the contrary

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It could/should be many times more &quot;adequate&quot;.  I would like to
<br>
be able to exclude/include at will mailing list archives, portal
<br>
pages and so on.  When I say I want only English that should be
<br>
all I get, it is not necessarily so today.  Quoted phrases are
<br>
not always taken as such.  Exclusions do not always exclude.  I
<br>
haven't looked into it but it would be much more &quot;adequate&quot; if a
<br>
programmatic interface was public so the hit list could more
<br>
easily be fed to something else of one's own devising.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I never suffered from &quot;too many pages&quot;, or outdated pages. I would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy for EVERY page ever put online to stay forever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What?  You have never performed a search that gave you hundreds
<br>
of thousands of hits, most of them irrelevant?  You have never
<br>
clicked on broken links?  I would also be much happier if the
<br>
low level protocols also included date created and date last
<br>
updated.  For many topics I could care less about material more
<br>
than a few years old.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is funny that he should use the &quot;entropy&quot; concept, as the reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for all this outdated pages is, on the contrary, the fact that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not subject to entropy. A poster in a street will not stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forever, due to scarce space (=&gt; covered by some other poster) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entropy (decay) ; a web page will. It is order over-preserved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (by a bit of electrical energy of server machines), not entropy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Accounts go dead and any links to those pages are now dangling
<br>
pointers.  This is to some small degree an increase in
<br>
disorder.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again there's an obvious parallel between the Internet and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreseeable physical word, set free of usual physical limits. In an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropic world, with almost infinite space, energy, and resources, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, like web pages, will not feel the effects of entropy anymore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and will just ADD one to the other, without replacing each other.
</em><br>
<p>In the case of Web pages this would not be a good thing.  Much
<br>
information has an expiration date implicit to the type of
<br>
information.  Keeping it all on the open web indefinitely (vs.
<br>
archives) would be like keeping every newspaper, book, magazine
<br>
you had ever seen in your office.  Hmmm, actually looking at my
<br>
office this doesn't seem to be anything I have much objection
<br>
to. :)
