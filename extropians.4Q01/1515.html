<p>The colony would have a lifespan, or generation time, anyway, on the order

of large animals, not on the order of non-colony insect generation times.
<br>
How do they compete with insects which evolve far more quickly? Does the
<br>
colony organisation put them out of direct competition with other insects,
<br>
and into the same kind of space as larger animals???
<br>
<p>### You are right - the colony is an organism, the queen is like an ovum
<br>
which can directly generate all somatic cells (the individual ants) and the
<br>
germline cells - drones (spermmatozoa) and daughter queens. The generation
<br>
span is equivalent to the average interval between the establishment of the
<br>
mother colony and its daughter colonies. And indeed, the ant colony can
<br>
perform feats impossible for individual insects, allowing it to compete not
<br>
so much by very quick adaptation but by the coordinated use of superior
<br>
force, although the ecological niches are still not the same as for larger
<br>
animals.
<br>
<p>We are evolving towards more complex societies and one day a sentient
<br>
equivalent of an anthill may be formed by individuals willing to forgo
<br>
individual reproduction for the benefits of specialization, efficiency and
<br>
extreme social stability. The reason why ants don't cheat on their nestmates
<br>
(except if subverted by outside influences) is because any defection from
<br>
the social rules kills their genes by reducing the fitness of the colony. If
<br>
the same model developed in a human society, it could be very efficient at
<br>
gathering and processing information and could sweep aside simpler organisms
<br>
just like what happened when ants developed eusociality and multiplied to
<br>
make up a major fraction of insect biomass in some environments.
<br>
<p>By the way, there are mammalian examples of similar reproductive
<br>
specialization is some species of mole-rats.
