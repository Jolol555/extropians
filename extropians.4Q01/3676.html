</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I maintain it does not, in this case if you swap two newly minted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unscratched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coins the economy will not be effected. Thus they have the &quot;same identity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as the economy is concerned but of course being a thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two quarters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have twice the mass of one.
</em><br>
<p>The key phrase here is &quot;as far as the economy is concerned&quot;.  When we are
<br>
talking about identity and survival, most people want &quot;as far as I am
<br>
concerned&quot;.  According to your example, my company could kill me and hire
<br>
another Software Engineer (even if they don't resemble me at all).  There
<br>
would be no affect as far as the company was concerned, but I would object
<br>
to that plan as my identity is clearly destroyed as far as I am concerned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's true but a quarter is a thing, in the same way brick is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, but as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said I don't believe I am a thing. The number 17 is not a thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither is the color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red the word &quot;beautiful&quot; or computer software.
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe that the laws of physics will distinguish between what you
<br>
call &quot;things&quot; and &quot;non-things&quot;.  A transporter or a copier will treat you
<br>
and the brick the same.  I don't think whether you call it a &quot;thing&quot; will
<br>
matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why if you have two MP3 files of the same symphony on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; erase one file you are not poorer for it because nothing has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost.
</em><br>
<p>I claim something has been lost, but you don't see it because your example
<br>
is something that can be easily duplicated.  What if the music industry
<br>
succeeds in making uncopyable music files.  Having two copies means that two
<br>
people could move it to their walkman's and walk around.  Having one copy
<br>
means that only one person could move it to their walkman and walk around.
<br>
(Just like being poorer for having one quarter instead of two.)  You just
<br>
don't see the difference because you are assuming that you can copy the
<br>
symphony at will.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; do you think you're more like a symphony or more like a brick?
</em><br>
<p>By your definition of whether I am a valuable thing that loses value when
<br>
destroyed, I am more like a brick.  (After all, I do have a natural clone
<br>
walking around, but I still believe that something would be lost if one of
<br>
us were destroyed.)
<br>
<p><p><p>I think these arguments continue because people are limiting themselves to
<br>
only looking at one copy.  Yes, if you can only have one quarter, it doesn't
<br>
matter which one.  But if you look at ALL the quarters, then each one is
<br>
uniquely valuable, and something is lost if any of them are destroyed.
<br>
(Whether there is a &quot;loss&quot; to the universe might have a different answer
<br>
from &quot;did I survive&quot; which I think is where the original debate arose from.)
