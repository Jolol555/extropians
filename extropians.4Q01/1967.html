I believe that Lee has distilled the discussion down to
<br>
some key components (and would therefore encourage everyone
<br>
to read his argument).
<br>
<p>I'd like to extend it a bit from an extropic position.
<br>
(Apologies to Hal if he as already argued this because I
<br>
can't follow the thread back through the Javien discussions.)
<br>
<p>Lee points out the differences between &quot;inventiveness&quot;,
<br>
&quot;craftmanship&quot; and &quot;universal distribution&quot;.  This goes
<br>
to the heart of the issue.
<br>
<p>If you are downloading an MP3 file, to listen to it once
<br>
and make it available for redistribution, the extropic
<br>
benefit is arguably minimal.  If you are downloading it
<br>
in a study of musical styles and creative exercises,
<br>
its extropic benefit is greater (e.g. how much would our
<br>
development of technology {and/or dark uses of it}
<br>
accelerate if textbooks were downloadable for free?).
<br>
If you are downloading it (esp. if it is a patent) to
<br>
figure out how to work around it, then its extropic
<br>
benefit is presumably even higher.
<br>
<p>I agree with Lee that there are clear extropic benefits
<br>
to allowing critics, artists, and engineers &quot;free&quot; access
<br>
to information.  It encourages the distillation, focusing,
<br>
refinement and trancendence of the &quot;state-of-the-art&quot;.
<br>
<p>I question whether &quot;free entertainment&quot; uses of prior art
<br>
are generally extropic (as perhaps Eliezer may have suggested).
<br>
It comes down to a question of whether the &quot;free entertainment&quot;
<br>
uses of &quot;informarion&quot; are productive from an economic or societal
<br>
perspective.  Yes, we could construct a society where everyone is
<br>
maintained in a Matrix VR pod thinking we are evolving through time
<br>
(where the beginnings and ends are artificial constructs), but is
<br>
that &quot;productive&quot; in what we currently perceive as reality?
<br>
<p>As Lee says, &quot;we could instead encourage gradual, incremental
<br>
development and universal access&quot;.  Well the patent laws
<br>
(and older copyright laws) seemed to support that.  What
<br>
is necessary is to turn back copyright trends that provide
<br>
exclusive long-term rights (beyond a reasonable period)
<br>
so that information after a limited period of protection
<br>
really does become &quot;free&quot;.
<br>
<p>In a practical world we should encourage &quot;the production of
<br>
totally new information and invention&quot; but we should be
<br>
tolerant, perhaps even supportive of, &quot;incremental changes
<br>
and adaptations&quot;.  So we should be accepting (and supporting)
<br>
of those sources that distill information into condensations
<br>
we can label as black, white, and grey.  At the same time we
<br>
should discourage practices that seek to distribute IP
<br>
without any recognition or compensation for those individuals
<br>
who produced such information.
<br>
