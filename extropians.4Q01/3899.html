</em><br>
<p>Think about a lot of the technological advances in computing the
<br>
last 10 years.  The big one that comes to mind is the WWW -- back
<br>
in the day, people looking for porn had to jump through hoops to
<br>
decode porn off of Usenet.  They had clunky gopher and FTP clients
<br>
where you had to download the whole porn file (over a slow 9600 or
<br>
slower link) just to see it and decide if you want to keep it.
<br>
GIF was limited to 256 colors and the compression ratio wasn't
<br>
much to speak of.  Then came the WWW, providing a grope-and-click
<br>
interface to porn.  Small file thumbnails to preview it before
<br>
commiting your low-speed link to downloading it.  JPEG to bring
<br>
better quality at smaller file sizes.
<br>
<p>Then came higher bandwidth to push more porn around.
<br>
<p>Then, came audio streaming.  Then video streaming.  Then,
<br>
A/V streaming.  For pay-per-view porn, of course.  I think some
<br>
of Real Networks biggest early customers were all porn shops.
<br>
You really think the commercial business market really drove
<br>
that company's technology forward?  I don't.
<br>
<p>Today, there's work on tele-immersive stuff, under the guise
<br>
of virtual conferencing and all that rubbish.  You know, if
<br>
someone just marketed tele-immersion with force-feedback and
<br>
smell-o-vision to the porn industry, you'd see that technology
<br>
develop orders of magnitude faster and come to market way before
<br>
the private sector researchers could blink.  And it'd be at a
<br>
$99.95 price point and shipped in discrete brown paper wrapping,
<br>
overnight to your doorstep.
<br>
<p>I think a good place to start would be to develop and market
<br>
force-feedback bondage equipment - collars, manacles, and the
<br>
like - so that a &quot;virtual Dom&quot; could control them on a customer
<br>
slave remotely.  Big money in that, I tell you.  Couple that
<br>
with A/V streaming of &quot;your own personal virtual Dom&quot; and
<br>
you're in business.
<br>
<p>Yow.  If anyone steals this idea, please cut me in on some of
<br>
the money, please.  :-)
<br>
<p>$ whois virtuadom.com
<br>
No match for &quot;VIRTUADOM.COM&quot;.
<br>
<p>There you go.
