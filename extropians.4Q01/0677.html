Spies in sky guide strikes
<br>
Unmanned planes inform without risk
<br>
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/10/10/MN127267.DTL">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/10/10/MN127267.DTL</a>
<br>
Small robotic aircraft may help the U.S. military to identify targets and
<br>
assess damage in the Afghan war.
<br>
<p>Ten years after they were extensively deployed in the Gulf War, robotic
<br>
aircraft with video camera &quot;eyes&quot; have found a secure niche in U.S. military
<br>
engagements.
<br>
<p>Known as &quot;unmanned aerial vehicles&quot; (UAVs), their primary role is
<br>
surveillance: They prowl over enemy terrain and transmit what they &quot;see&quot; back
<br>
to their ground operators, who remotely guide them with joysticks.
<br>
<p>UAVs can provide valuable battlefield information that couldn't otherwise be
<br>
obtained without endangering U.S. pilots. &quot;The value (of UAVs) is saving
<br>
lives,&quot; stressed Cheryl Owen, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of
<br>
Defense.
<br>
<p>On Sept. 22, the Taliban forces in Afghanistan claimed to have shot down an
<br>
unpiloted plane over the Tashgurgan Pass. In response, Defense Secretary
<br>
Donald Rumsfeld told reporters the United States had lost touch with an
<br>
unpiloted plane but had no reason to believe it had been shot down.
<br>
<p>Late last week on CNN, retired NATO Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark said:
<br>
&quot;I think there are many unmanned aerial vehicles already over that region.&quot;
<br>
<p>NOT A TOY
<br>
UAVs were &quot;thought of as toys for many years,&quot; acknowledges a Pentagon Web
<br>
site. But that's no longer true. Because it's cheaper to build a UAV than an
<br>
aircraft for humans, more UAVs can be built and sent into battle zones than
<br>
human-carrying aircraft, said Pentagon spokeswoman Owen.
<br>
<p>Carrying sensors able to see through clouds, she noted, UAVs &quot;give you a sense
<br>
of the battlefield without putting your airmen in danger.&quot; The aircraft carry
<br>
infrared sensors that allow them to see warm objects, such as tank engines, in
<br>
the dark.
<br>
<p>At the moment, leading military UAVs include the U.S. Army's Israeli-made
<br>
Hunter, which is more than 20 feet long with an almost 30-foot wingspan, and
<br>
the U.S. Air Force's Predator, which is more than 26 feet long and has a
<br>
wingspan of nearly 50 feet.
<br>
<p>Hunter was used for surveillance in the American bombing of Kosovo, Owen said.
<br>
<p>PIONEER IN ITS FIELD
<br>
The oldest active-duty drone in the U.S. military is the Pioneer, first
<br>
deployed in 1986. Its developers included an Israeli firm.
<br>
<p>The military is also field-testing the 12-ton Global Hawk, a Teledyne Ryan-
<br>
developed drone that &quot;can travel 12,500 miles for up to 38 to 42 hours on one
<br>
tank of gas&quot; and can fly more than 10 miles high, Owen said.
<br>
<p>During the Gulf War, all the military services flew more than 500 sorties of
<br>
UAVs lasting a total of over 1,600 hours.
<br>
<p>UAVs are increasingly common tools in the armies of other countries. Late last
<br>
week, Predator manufacturer General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. of San
<br>
Diego announced it had signed a $60 million contract to sell Predators to the
<br>
Italian Air Force.
<br>
<p>&quot;Since 1994, the Predator system has been operated by the U.S. Air Force and
<br>
has proven its military utility as an essential intelligence gatherer and
<br>
targeting system,&quot; said the firm's president, Thomas J. Cassidy Jr.
<br>
<p>CONTROL IN THE SKIES
<br>
Military drones are becoming so common that they might endanger civilian
<br>
airliners. According to Jane's Airport Review, European UAV firms have started
<br>
a project to help air traffic controllers monitor drones as well as civilian
<br>
airliners.
<br>
<p>California is a center of UAV development and testing, one example being the
<br>
Naval Air Warfare Center in China Lake. The Global Hawk will be operated out
<br>
of Beale Air Force Base, 40 miles north of Sacramento, Air Force Chief of
<br>
Staff Gen. John P. Jumper announced last week.
<br>
<p>No active-duty U.S. drones carry weapons -- yet. But research teams are
<br>
developing drones for carrying bombs, Owen said. They're also planning to
<br>
update the Predator by arming it with an anti-tank missile called Hellfire.
<br>
<p>The old science-fiction dream of an &quot;automated battlefield,&quot; where robots
<br>
fight rather than humans, is still a ways off. A baby step toward it was taken
<br>
a few years ago when Sen. John Warner, R-Va., inserted a passage in a
<br>
procurement bill stating that by or before 2006, 25 to 35 percent of all
<br>
military aircraft should be unmanned, Owen said.
<br>
<p>Down the road, the brass hope to develop &quot;micro&quot; aircraft that can travel
<br>
through urban areas and buildings for surveillance purposes. Among the devices
<br>
being developed is one &quot;about the size of a robin,&quot; Owen said.
<br>
<p>An omen of the automated battlefield occurred during the Gulf War: Five Iraqi
<br>
soldiers &quot;surrendered&quot; to a robotic aircraft by waving white flags as it flew
<br>
overhead.
<br>
<p>Keeping an eye from afar
<br>
The U.S.-British military strike in Afghanistan was preceded by surveillance
<br>
using satellites, high-altitude spy planes and unmanned aerial vehicles
<br>
(UAVs), or drones, such as the Predator. The surveillance provided information
<br>
on terrain, people and structures, such as terrorist training camps, without
<br>
endangering a pilot.
<br>
<p>-- How the drone functions
<br>
<p>The Predator needs a 3,000-foot runway and can take off from terrain like dry
<br>
lake beds.
<br>
<p>1 Drone takes off
<br>
<p>2 Drone is operated from ground control station via satellites.
<br>
<p>3 Near-real-time video is transmitted to ground control operators. Infrared
<br>
camera allows operator to view people, cars and trucks 20 miles away from
<br>
drone.
<br>
<p>-- Capturing images
<br>
<p>A military operation could use images similar to those below to determine
<br>
whether a site should be targeted for a strike.
<br>
<p>Satellite image provides a snapshot of the area and can detect the presence of
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>Drones' high-magnification cameras can show differences of people on the
<br>
ground.
<br>
<p>Predator profile
<br>
<p>-- Length: 26.7 ft.
<br>
<p>-- Width: 48.7 ft.
<br>
<p>-- Cruising speed: 80-104 mph
<br>
<p>-- Maximum altitude: 26,000 ft.
<br>
<p>-- Weight: 1,500 pounds
<br>
<p>-- Imaging capabilities: High-resolution images in any type of weather, day
<br>
and night.
