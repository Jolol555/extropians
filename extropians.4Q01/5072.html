<em>&gt;From: James Rogers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Similar trends apply to the UK as well.  As has been mentioned in the past,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the beginning of the 20th century when guns were totally unregulated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the UK, the murder rate was substantially lower than it was at the end of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the 20th century when handguns were basically outlawed.  The same goes for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overall violent crime rates.
</em><br>
<p>I have no doubt we are going over old ground here. However, its a 
<br>
truism that correlation does not imply causation. Lots of things have 
<br>
changed in the UK over the last hundred years. It would be a stretch 
<br>
to imply that guns, or their lack, are responsible for all these 
<br>
changes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It should also be noted that virtually all of the concentrations of violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crime in the US occur in locales where firearms have been banned or severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;restricted.
</em><br>
<p>Again this is just an argument from correlation. Is there any 
<br>
evidence that is more convincing? I realise that this sort of 
<br>
evidence is hard to come by.
<br>
<p>best, patrick
