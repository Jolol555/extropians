Blind seers

James Grant, Forbes Global, 11.26.01, 12:00 AM ET
<br>
from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/global/2001/1126/090.html">http://www.forbes.com/global/2001/1126/090.html</a>
<br>
<p>Ban the words &quot;foreseeable future.&quot; No one ever can know what's coming.
<br>
<p>Bear markets bring out the reformer in all of us, so let me make a proposal.
<br>
Ban the words &quot;foreseeable future.&quot; William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White,
<br>
authors of The Elements of Style, condemned the phrase in general usage. &quot;A
<br>
cliché and a fuzzy one,&quot; they charged. In finance it is worse than fuzzy. It
<br>
facilitates grandiose thinking, which leads to poor decision-making and
<br>
early-morning sleeplessness. &quot;How much of the future is foreseeable?&quot;
<br>
demanded Strunk and White. &quot;Ten minutes? Ten years? Any of it? By whom is it
<br>
foreseeable? Seers? Experts? Everybody?&quot;
<br>
<p>The higher the stock market, the greater the imagined ease of prediction. At
<br>
or near the peak, investors are prone to believe they can see into the next
<br>
county. So deluded, they pony up 100 times next year's forecast net income
<br>
for the stocks of companies that may or may not even exist in 12 months. No
<br>
margin of safety is necessary if tomorrow is an open book.
<br>
<p>You would suppose that 18 months after the surprise ending of the world's
<br>
greatest boom, central bankers and CEOs would abandon the conceit that they
<br>
possess foreknowledge. Yet they refuse.
<br>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is a prime offender, despite its obvious recent
<br>
predictive lapses. &quot;Foreseeable future&quot; has been a fixture in the
<br>
boilerplate of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) since just before
<br>
the top of the stock market.
<br>
<p>Astonished by the swiftness of the economic collapse, the Fed this year has
<br>
made a succession of steep, unprecedented cuts in the federal funds rate. It
<br>
has acted in good faith, but it has spoken the phony language of prophecy.
<br>
For instance, consider what the FOMC said in the press release disclosing
<br>
the drop of half a percentage point in the funds rate on Sept. 17: &quot;For the
<br>
foreseeable future, the committee continues to believe that against the
<br>
background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic
<br>
growth, and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted
<br>
mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness.&quot;
<br>
<p>Despite the weasel words &quot;information currently available,&quot; the committee
<br>
seemed to believe that futurity--some part of it--was revealed to Alan
<br>
Greenspan. The idea was presumptuous even before Sept. 11.
<br>
<p>There is, of course, a forecast implicit in every squiggle of the funds rate
<br>
as well as in every investment. Investors have no choice but to take a stab
<br>
at anticipating the future. At a minimum they must decide what level of
<br>
confidence to attach to the conclusions they form out of necessarily
<br>
imperfect information. By the end of the great bull market people had begun
<br>
to mistake guesswork for clairvoyance. The future was perfectly lucid, they
<br>
decided. It would be just like the past but even more lucrative.
<br>
<p>This unforeseen phase of our market history is, of course, well under way,
<br>
but the two empty words keep materializing. They surfaced in, of all places,
<br>
the June 10-Q report of Global Crossing, the struggling builder of broadband
<br>
networks. Example: &quot;The company expects that its cash flows from operations,
<br>
together with its committed credit facilities, will be adequate to meet its
<br>
anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future.&quot; In a second
<br>
offense the company said that it expected to stay in compliance with the
<br>
terms and conditions of its financing agreements for the &quot;foreseeable
<br>
future.&quot; In a recent bulletin, incidentally, Moody's Investors Service
<br>
voices doubts on that score, citing weakness in cash flow.
<br>
<p>But nothing about Global Crossing is or was foreseeable, neither its
<br>
brilliant rise nor its fiery fall. Nobody guessed that the upstart would
<br>
command a $50 billion stock-market cap at its peak , although it came to
<br>
pass.
<br>
<p>Now it's about a fiftieth of $50 billion; its $3 billion of senior secured
<br>
bank debt is quoted at 50 cents on the dollar, and its $4.8 billion of junk
<br>
bonds fetch about 20 cents on the dollar. How can this be? Why would the
<br>
bankruptcy and workout community not scoop up these claims for the
<br>
equity-like returns they must certainly offer? Because at this murky moment
<br>
nobody has a clue what Global Crossing might be worth. Employing the
<br>
now-current cliché, observers complain, &quot;There is no visibility.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ignorance about tomorrow is a constant of human affairs. Submission to this
<br>
truth is what's variable. In finance, submission entails a healthy fear of
<br>
leverage and a decent respect for the relation of price to earnings.
<br>
Valuation of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index at a rich 29 times trailing net
<br>
income suggests that to many investors, the future is still foreseeable.
<br>
We'd be richer if it really were.
