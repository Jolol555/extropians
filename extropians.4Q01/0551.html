<em>&gt; &gt;I think the historical reality of Sufism is quite different from what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;comes through the filters working on most of what gets through to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Western intellectuals about Sufism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would be interested in any sources you can point my way.
</em><br>
<p>Last night I finished &quot;Islam: The Straight Path&quot; by John L. Esposito, which
<br>
I highly commend as a good introductory text on Islam by a recognized
<br>
scholar who does not seem to &quot;take sides&quot; in his writing at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;First factual tidbit: Consider that the word &quot;assassin&quot; comes from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;practice of one particular Sufi sect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a word game... We can find many life-oriented words from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sufis as well.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, agreed.  I didn't mean to offer these &quot;tidbits&quot; of proof of anything
<br>
except that the reality of Sufi history and practice might be different from
<br>
the distilled, essential &quot;best&quot; that gets presented to sympathetic
<br>
Westerners.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Second factual tidbit: Sufism is &quot;guru-oriented&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This isn't my observation or experience, though. Where did this come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from?
</em><br>
<p>Here's some quotes from Esposito's book, mentioned above:
<br>
<p>&quot;Organizationally, Sufi orders built on the already established relationship
<br>
of master (*shaykh* or Persian, *pir*) and student or disciple.  Sufi
<br>
masters drew their authority from their illustrious predecessors.  As the
<br>
authority of traditions [in mainstream Islam] was based on a system of links
<br>
dating back to the Prophet, so too a similar system of linkages of pious
<br>
predecessors was established going all the way back to Muhammad.  Spiritual
<br>
pedigree or lineage was the source of a master's religious authority,
<br>
teachings, and practices.  Because of his piety, reputation for sanctity,
<br>
and often miraculous powers, the master was viewed as especially near to
<br>
God, a friend of God.  He served as a spiritual guide and a model to be
<br>
emulated.  Hist followers wished to be near him both to benefit from his
<br>
teaching, advice and example as well as to receive his blessing, the product
<br>
of his spiritual power.  Over time the teachings of masters were passed on
<br>
through their disciples to future generations.&quot; [p.105]
<br>
<p>&quot;The focal point of a Sufi order was the domed tomb of its founder, who was
<br>
venerated as a saint (*wali*, friend) of God.  The tomb became a center for
<br>
pilgrimage as visitors came to appeal to the saint for assistance.  His
<br>
spiritual power and intercession before God could be invoked for a safe
<br>
pregnancy, success in exams, or a prosperous business, and offerings were
<br>
made in thanksgiving for answered prayers.&quot; [p.107]
<br>
<p>[Regarding the actual practice of Sufism:] Awareness of the divine presence
<br>
in all of creation became a justification for the assimilation of saint
<br>
worship, fetishism, and all manner of magical and superstitious practices.
<br>
A movement that had emphasized poverty and asceticism became weighed down
<br>
with shayhks, whose playing on the credulity of poor and ignorant followers
<br>
rather than sanctity won them followers and financial fortune.  The *faquir*
<br>
(mystic/mendicant) became the faker; the spiritual heads of medicant orders
<br>
were transformed into dispensers of amulets, becoming wealthy feudal
<br>
landlords.&quot; [p.109]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;(as is most of the actual practice of Islam)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmmm. I need to think more about this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;encouraging the same kind of deference to the ulama that we see in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;extreme forms in the much wider-spread influence of Sunni Wahhabist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fundamentalism in the Islamic world today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are extremists in any group, though.
</em><br>
<p>True, but the truth that for obvious reasons remains unspoken by Western
<br>
political leaders and the popular press is that what we would call
<br>
&quot;extremism&quot; is far, far more widespread in the Islamic world than most of us
<br>
realize.  Wahhabism is the official religion of Saudi Arabia.  There are
<br>
tens of millions (at least) of people throughout the Islamic world that
<br>
would by Western standards be called violently evangelical fundamentalists.
<br>
Try to imagine a world in which Jerry Falwell would be considered a
<br>
moderate.  Now imagine that his political party has power in many countries.
<br>
That exercise will give you a clue as to what the West is facing.  I
<br>
challenge anyone who disagrees with this characterization to cite evidence
<br>
to the contrary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I assent to the links between Islam and Sufism though- they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stronger than I thought previously, because I discovered that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabic language has some special qualities for the Sufis that other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; languages don't have, plus the Koran codifies some of the Sufi ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more compactly than other religious documents (probably) do.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I know what you mean by this last comment.  Since I've
<br>
reluctantly consigned myself to a course of Islamic studies, I'd be curious
<br>
to better understand your meaning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One concept that I find useful from the Sufis is to present ideas to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people using a multilayered approach. For example, with the stories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each reading presents something (often totally) new. Also, words in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabic provide incomplete-but-useful maps to the Sufi ideas. If one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begins with the Arabic root of the word, one can produce more words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that provide some of the map of Sufic thought. (But this a word game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too..)
</em><br>
<p>It is, and an old friend of mine who was an Islamic scholar in his youth
<br>
(and is now a psychiatrist) recently wrote to me about the extreme ambiguity
<br>
of Arabic, compared to English, a quality that lends itself to poetry but
<br>
not, I'm afraid, to rational discourse.
