<em>&gt; I haven't disagreed with anything you have stated, in the previous post, Mr.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Does it occur to you that &quot;pulling the rug from under&quot; anyone's
<br>
financed universities that teach anything you do not approve us
<br>
is not any of your business?  Would it not be better to show
<br>
ever more clearly that the US has the best and most workable
<br>
system as widely as possible and thus undercut any
<br>
&quot;anti-American propaganda&quot;?  Generally, anyone who wants to
<br>
finance their own establishments, especially in foreight
<br>
countries, can teach whatever they want - right, wrong or
<br>
indifferent.  
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want to force America to conserve, I want alternatives to Persian Gulf oil,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want clean energy, especially for transportation. But, it will take enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain, apparently, to encourage the market to make this move. Perhaps another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few thousand Americans dead, from another attack will do this, perhaps not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Conservation is probably not a viable answer but I certainly
<br>
agree that we need to stop depending on oil for primary energy
<br>
as quickly as possible.  
<br>
<p>I hope we can do it on a much more positive spin than fear of
<br>
more thousands of Americans dead though.

<em>&gt; In the meanwhile, for the purposes of this list, I would say that the views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those who &quot;understand&quot; (read: sympathize) with attackers of 9-11, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only make Extropian philosophy appear to be an outside fringe group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Understanding, not condoning, is required if you actually want
<br>
to skillfully change a situation.  Not understanding is truly
<br>
non-extropian if we need to cast labels about.  I do not care so
<br>
much for others opinions as for doing that which I believe is
<br>
required to improve the situation.
