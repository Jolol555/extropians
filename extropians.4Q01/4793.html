<p>
The thrlll of discovery is the purest, least understood event in science. Now,
<br>
studies of the brain are revealing the anatomy of a 'Eureka moment.'
<br>
<p>Now I get it
<br>
By measuring changes in electrical activity in the brain, researchers believe
<br>
they have pinpointed the so-called &quot;Eureka moment,&quot; the point in time a person
<br>
understands a concept. Subjects were shown a sentence, one word at a time, on
<br>
a computer screen. On its own, the sentence seems nonsensical, but becomes
<br>
clear when a cue word is presented.
<br>
----------
<br>
Now, work by Soraci and other scientists indicates that the eureka moment can
<br>
not only be detected electrically, but may itself hold important secrets,
<br>
giving new insights into creativity, thinking and memory, and even suggesting
<br>
better ways to teach. One of the secrets may be the intriguing notion that
<br>
confusion is key to memory.
<br>
-----------
<br>
Solaci said educators should strive to design lessons that will give students
<br>
aha moments. A lesson on evolution, for example, might start with some of the
<br>
same clues Darwin saw - striking similarities between man and ape, finches
<br>
exquisitely attuned to their environments - before explaining his theory.
<br>
--------------
<br>
In the most recent research on aha moments, scientists have measured a
<br>
distinct pattern of brain activity that comes with the sudden insight,
<br>
according to Amanda DeFiore, the lead scientist on the experiment, which has
<br>
not been published. About 400 milliseconds after the key word is read,
<br>
revealing the meaning of the sentence, electrodes on the scalp pick up a
<br>
pulse, called an N400.
<br>
--------------
<br>
The next step, DeFiore said, would be to use more sophisticated brain-scanning
<br>
equipment to discern where in the brain, precisely, the aha pulse originates.
<br>
Eureka moments remain deeply mysterious, she said, but, with this information,
<br>
perhaps everything would start falling into place.
