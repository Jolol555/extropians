This is not exactly the greatest story ever told.
<br>
But perhaps somewhere in the top 10.
<br>
<p>In the mid 80s this joke went around Ridgecrest Taxifornia:
<br>
<p>A man had enjoyed a bit too much Christmas cheer.
<br>
As he was riding home, he was so inebriated he fell off
<br>
his ass.  &quot;Jesus Christ, that hurts!&quot; he commented.  From
<br>
a nearby stable, a young woman's voice was heard to say,
<br>
&quot;You know Joseph, I think I like that name better than
<br>
Hoerkheimer.&quot;
<br>
<p>Forward to 1985.  My good  friend was a former Mormon,
<br>
currently atheist, but his parents are still devout.  They
<br>
gave him an imitation-ceramic crèche (hand painted!) for
<br>
which he showed polite appreciation.  The following year,
<br>
they were coming to visit him, so he erected a christmas
<br>
tree, complete with lights and bulbs, but he couldn't keep
<br>
the accursed cats from playing with the decorations, evil
<br>
spawn of satan that they are.  They persisted in knocking
<br>
the ornaments off the tree and batting them around endlessly,
<br>
so my friend mounted the tree upside down from the ceiling,
<br>
out of the reach of the furry demons.  (You would have
<br>
to know my friend.  He does things like this.)
<br>
<p>A few days before christmas he remembered the crèche
<br>
and set it out below the inverted christmas tree, but once
<br>
again, the cats decided to play holy hockey with the
<br>
figurines, scattering them thru-out the home.  He searched
<br>
the next day and found them all, with the curious exception
<br>
of a donkey and the central figure.  Fearing that his
<br>
parents would notice the absence of the jesus, (holy
<br>
parents and adoring magi worshipping nothing) he got
<br>
on the phone and ordered a replacement ass and savior,
<br>
to be sent out post haste.  He glued the surviving holy
<br>
family, wise guys and beasts to a piece of plywood in
<br>
order to thwart the fiendish felines.
<br>
<p>While vacuuming behind the sofa on christmas eve, my friend
<br>
found jesus.  As luck would have it, the replacement
<br>
turned up in the post that same day.  So now he had two
<br>
jesi.   Then he got an idea.  He glued the second infant-god
<br>
figure to the board next to the original, just to see if his parents
<br>
would notice.
<br>
<p>But then he took the gag a little further than I would have.
<br>
He made an easel from popsicle sticks and made up a
<br>
placard, as one would see in a museum.  He wrote:
<br>
<p>&quot;A little-known fact of history tells us that the firstborn of
<br>
Joseph Christ and Mary Finklestein were actually twins.
<br>
One of the boys, Jesus, went on to own a carpentry shop,
<br>
and later to form a religious movement.  The other son,
<br>
Hoerkheimer, was thought to have suffered from unresolved
<br>
sibling rivalry issues, which may have eventually contributed
<br>
to his alcoholism and drug problems.&quot;
<br>
<p>His parents didn't like it.  spike
