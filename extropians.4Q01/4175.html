<p>Interesting. I really wonder what part of the primate cell
<br>
machinery is notably different from other mammals? Anybody
<br>
knows?

</em><br>
<p>Maybe you have no plans of getting extropianism respected?
<br>
Calling something Frankenstein is not a statement about it
<br>
merely being yuckky biology, but a statement that it is
<br>
unnecessary or unethical yuckky biology. Are you in favor of
<br>
unnecessary research (which takes resources that could be used
<br>
for real research) or unethical research (which is likely to
<br>
produce a well armed opposition pursuing you)?
<br>
<p>There is a lot of yuckky ethical and necessary research (like
<br>
studies of cortical development, which requires some rather
<br>
disturbing experiments on kittens), but that is a different
<br>
story. The ACT research belongs in this category IMHO, and is
<br>
nothing to be squeamish about. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OTOH, Extropianism says it's OK to go all Frankenstein with respect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to immigration.  Why is that, I ask? Oh, I see, because in order to 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It is because you americans want bright people like ME &lt;loud
<br>
European Mad Scientist laughter&gt; to immigrate and lecture at
<br>
your universities, enrich your culture or start transhumanist
<br>
companies in a positive business climate. And yes, maybe work as
<br>
dishwashers too. The point is, immigration is good for the US
<br>
and the immigrants. Just wait and see how the anti-immigrant
<br>
countries of Europe will fare over the next decades with falling
<br>
birth rates and more and more retired people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Face it, Extropianism is a memeset created by and for the GreedHeads 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Commerce and the Empire Builders in Govt....actually, it is FOR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who are farmed/ranched by the GreedHeads....
</em><br>
<p>Interesting. The above is almost word by word a criticism I
<br>
heard of transhumanism over here too? One reason could be that
<br>
it is true of course, but there is another intriguing
<br>
possibility (not necessarily mutually exclusive): that you are
<br>
suffering from a certain memeset (what postmodernists call a
<br>
narrative) that says extropianism must be due to some system
<br>
conspiracy to keep people down. In fact, if you start to trace
<br>
the associations of the above statement back (for example by
<br>
looking at what texts and groups commonly use the same ideas and
<br>
terms and who they in turn got them from) you will soon find
<br>
that there is indeed a rather coherent narrative that you are
<br>
buying into here. Basically it says that free trade is always a
<br>
tool of oppression, and cannot be really good (in the long run,
<br>
at least) for any individual except for the minority at the top.
<br>
So people promoting free trade and similar ideas such as free
<br>
immigration either has to be dupes, belonging to the minority
<br>
profiting from it or willingly bought by it. Interesting enough,
<br>
people beliving in this memeset almost never ask themselves
<br>
whether *they* believe what they do because it profits them in
<br>
some way, or because they have assimilated these ideas from the
<br>
surrounding culture. 
<br>
<p>I would say the empirical evidence is fairly good that free
<br>
trade and free movement of people makes nations more wealthy and
<br>
peaceful, making it a rational strategy to strive for such
<br>
things. Others might disagree, but then we can discuss this
<br>
using rational discourse rather than assuming the other has been
<br>
&quot;bought&quot; by special interests. Even if Max More was personally
<br>
hired by the Illuminati to spread extropianism, it might still
<br>
be a good idea - either it holds together under scrutiny, or it
<br>
doesn't.
