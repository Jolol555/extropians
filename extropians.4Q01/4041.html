</em><br>
<p>But the case you point out above does not need to be ad hominem to get the 
<br>
point across.  You can say: &quot;The idea that we never landed on the moon is 
<br>
absolutely ludicrous.&quot; or &quot;There is a fundamental flaw in the argument that 
<br>
we never landed on the moon.  For example...&quot; so why say: &quot;You are an idiot 
<br>
because you think that we never landed on the moon.&quot; or &quot;Anyone who thinks 
<br>
we didn't land on the moon is stupid.&quot;  The idea itself is laughable, but 
<br>
that doesn't mean that the person saying it has no mental value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For example, I think if in response to my proposed response to the 911
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attacks, someone had said, &quot;Look Robert you blithering idiot, thats just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong, you are such a complete asshole&quot;, I think the attack would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been justified.
</em><br>
<p>I don't; what I think would have been justified would be a response like: 
<br>
&quot;Robert, the ideas you have presented on this issue are just plain 
<br>
wrong.  Why?  Because...&quot;  Just because you have said something that most 
<br>
people feel is without merit does *not* mean that *you* are without 
<br>
merit.  I've made some stupid posts before, and said arguably &quot;dumb&quot; things 
<br>
at other times, but I don't expect someone to attack my character because 
<br>
I've written or said those &quot;dumb&quot; things.  If you challenge the ideas, the 
<br>
holder of those ideas might change his mind.  But if you attack that person 
<br>
for holding those ideas, what recourse is there?  Is he supposed to say: 
<br>
&quot;Yes, you're right.  I am an idiot.&quot;?
<br>
<p>Ultimately, this is an issue of semantics: what is defined as being &quot;ad 
<br>
hominem&quot; and &quot;zero tolerance.&quot;  According to Webster's dictionary, ad 
<br>
hominem is: &quot;1) appealing to one's prejudice, emotions, or special 
<br>
interests rather than to one's intellect or reason.  2) attacking an 
<br>
opponent's character rather than answering an argument.&quot;  I still cannot 
<br>
think of any time where ad hominem can't be avoided.
<br>
<p>Once again, I would like to stress that rules for their own sake are 
<br>
abhorrent.  But having been on this list for five plus years, and being the 
<br>
list admin for the last year and a quarter, I can honestly say that I think 
<br>
this policy is necessary and not a compromise of extropian values.
