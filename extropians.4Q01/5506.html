I recently wrote a long rant about immigration and briefly mentioned
<br>
ExI regarding their role in advising business and appearing at
<br>
speaking engagements, etc.
<br>
<p>I most certainly have no knowledge of how ExI operates with regards to
<br>
their funds or anything related to that, and I did not intend to give
<br>
that impression.  I am sure that whatever they do with any funds
<br>
derived from that is perfectly legal and ethical.
<br>
<p>My post was meant to address immigration, libertarianism and open
<br>
borders, and the Social Contract. I mentioned Exi as an example of a
<br>
think tank that happens to provide business advice, and that that sort
<br>
of business advice by think tanks is likely to be used by business
<br>
lobbies as justification for overriding the will of the American
<br>
people with respect to immigration.  That does not make ExI
<br>
unusual--there are hundreds of such entities, many of them headed up
<br>
by very prominent people, such as Congressmen and even Senators, etc.
