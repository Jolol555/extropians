<p>Further to Mike Butler's explanation on PCR.  (This is from my web page
<br>
on authoritative books,
<br>
<a href="http://discuss.foresight.org/~hibbert/books.html">http://discuss.foresight.org/~hibbert/books.html</a>.)
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Retreat to Commitment By W. W. Bartley III 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the philosophers who wrote about epistemology thought the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;questions they were trying to answer was &quot;What do we know?&quot; or 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do we know anything?&quot;. Karl Popper explained that the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;important question to address is closer to &quot;How should we decide 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;what to believe?&quot; His answer was Critical Rationalism, which says 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that you subject all your (proposed) answers to criticism, and see 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which ones stand up best. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartley fixed a bug in Popper's system. Religious people had 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;responded to Popper by claiming &quot;Everyone has to have faith in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;something. You have faith in your Critical Rationalism, I have 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;faith in the Word of God.&quot; Bartley's fix is Pan-Critical 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationalism. The fix is to subject the Critical Rationalism to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;criticism as well. The book has a very long section explaining 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;what Bartley thinks the best attacks on PCR would be, and then 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;defending it against them. At the end, he concludes that PCR is 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the most effective system he can find for getting better answers 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to questions, and that that's the best criteria he's found for 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;evaluating a way of thinking. 
<br>
<p>The other question Mike brought up was where the title (&quot;Retreat to
<br>
Commitment&quot;) came from.  The answer is that the first part of the book
<br>
gives background for Bartley's discussion of the bug discussed above in
<br>
Popper's epistemology.  It does so by giving a history of Protestant
<br>
(Episcopalian?  I don't really remember) thought.  As Mike alluded to,
<br>
historically, this particular faith believed in questioning the
<br>
doctrine, and discussing the implications for theology.  Eventually,
<br>
that led them into blind alleys where they couldn't justify particular
<br>
beliefs, or where they found contradictions.  According to Bartley, this
<br>
caused them to gradually retreat from their questioning stance to being
<br>
just another religion based on commitment to the received
<br>
interpretation.
