I wrote something yesterday about &quot;Life lives us&quot;. In particular,
<br>
about Greek dancing and music that is an expression of the most
<br>
important elements of life to the Greek culture. This note continues
<br>
the music discussion. I'm fascinated with its origin, so I'll talk
<br>
more about that.
<br>
<p>Rebetika music emerged with a life of its own from the sorrows and
<br>
pains of people who had nothing after some religious and political
<br>
upheavals in 1921.
<br>
<p>The Greeks were controlled and dominated for four hundred years by a
<br>
culture, the Turkish, who were as different from them as one can
<br>
imagine: different language, different personalities and so on. The
<br>
Greeks would have nearly lost their language and culture completely
<br>
(the Turks did their best to eliminate it), if it were not for the
<br>
strength that the Greek's orthodox Christian religion gave the
<br>
Greeks and the fact that the Christian monks ran &quot;Secret Schools&quot; at
<br>
night to teach the Greek children their Greek language and culture.
<br>
Finally, the Greeks gained their independence from the Turks (1829),
<br>
but their relations with the Turks after was not smooth, and some
<br>
Greeks from very early settlements still existed surrounded by
<br>
Turkish near Turkey.
<br>
<p>The way that a Greek person felt (and still today) towards the
<br>
Turkish after those 400 years was not exactly hatred, it's more like
<br>
disgust. They saw the Turks as barbarians. For example, when the
<br>
Greek women were raped by the Turkish men, the women committed
<br>
suicide rather than carry the child, and you would find many stories
<br>
today about suicide taken rather than being &quot;assimilated&quot;.
<br>
(BTW The Balts were similar to this in their feelings towards
<br>
the Soviets)
<br>
<p>In 1921, the Greek army invaded Turkey, which was the greatest
<br>
disaster in modern Greek history. They were slaughtered. In an
<br>
absurd settlement, the League of Nations decreed an exchange of
<br>
populations between the countries. Nationality was to be based on
<br>
religion. All orthodox Christians were declared Greek and all
<br>
Moslems were declared Turkish. The result was that the Greek
<br>
population swelled from four million to five-and-a-half million.
<br>
Athens and its port of Piraeus received the majority of the
<br>
refugees, which included small amounts of 'Greeks' that had been
<br>
away from Greece and living in Asia Minor for perhaps 1000 or more
<br>
years (but they still had their language). One might consider these
<br>
Asia Minor Greeks as closest to the &quot;original Greeks&quot;, but because
<br>
they had been away from mainland Greece for so long, they didn't
<br>
find enough commonalities with the other Greeks. These 'early Greek'
<br>
refugees were among the poorest in Piraeus. In their despair and
<br>
poverty and homeless feelings, they mixed with the 'Christian Smyrna
<br>
Turks' in the underground hashish dens, lamenting their sorrows, and
<br>
this was where the music was born. In time,the music evolved into a
<br>
national expression of every dream, hope, love, and fear that a
<br>
Greek carried. The music is still precious today to the Greeks.
