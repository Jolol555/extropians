<p><p>Actually, this applies to the US historically as well.  The era of mail

order machineguns had lower murder rates than today (which currently is
<br>
relatively low by historical standards).
<br>
<p>With respect to correlations between guns, murder, and violent crime in
<br>
general, of all the myriads of studies of various populations around the
<br>
world there is only one correlation that seems to be universal.  That
<br>
correlation is that there is an inverse relationship between the number of
<br>
guns and gun owners in the general population and the violent crime rates.
<br>
This is completely independent of the absolute crime levels and tracks very
<br>
closely both for societies that go from low gun penetration to many guns and
<br>
vice versa.  Of all the various claims that people on both sides of the
<br>
debate make, this is the only correlation that seems to hold up pretty
<br>
conclusively under scrutiny across all populations.
<br>
<p>What IS clear is that absolute murder levels are almost completely
<br>
independent of the level of gun ownership between populations.
