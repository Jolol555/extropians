<p>The major problem with Hoppe's viewpoint is that he thinks everybody sees 
<br>
things like he does: that their interest lies in the destruction of their 
<br>
fellows. But he is soooo wrong. Most people are happy to put up with a lot 
<br>
of inequity in order to make the system work. They see their interest as 
<br>
being served by keeping society stable, maintaining a workable system so 
<br>
long as it doesn't get too repressive, and making the best of their life. 
<br>
If that wasn't so society would have collapsed into savagery long ago.
<br>
<p>Economists like Hoppe are so out of touch to think that most people are 
<br>
money-seeking missiles. But he is worse than most. He thinks he is part of 
<br>
a natural aristocracy whose place in the natural order is to rule over the 
<br>
&quot;dullards&quot; and ensure that the harmony is not perverted by letting the 
<br>
majority have any say in that future.
<br>
<p>I really do think he hates humanity.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
