</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought you said you weren't a relativist.  Some actions, including

</em><br>
<p><p>I thought that you weren't for the US running the affairs of

other nations.  If you believe in sovereign states then it is
<br>
not defensible to disrupt another state just because you do not
<br>
like the way it is run.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most die-hard anarcho-capitalist libertarian like me, for example,
</em><br>

<em>&gt; biological weapons without proper safeguards near my house.  
</em><br>
<p>The biggest stockpile of biological weapons in the world belongs
<br>
to the US.  More nations have been disrupted and had their
<br>
governments forcefully destroyed and/or changed by the US using
<br>
illegal means (our definition of terror) than any other nation. 
<br>
So, will we apply our righteous (and I agree many of them are
<br>
righteous) standards to ourselves first and foremost?  Or will
<br>
we apply them haphazardly whether there are enough other agendas
<br>
for us to acheive benefit by interfering?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have not only the right, but the ethical duty, to interfere even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before he used the weapons, because the chance of an accident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatening my life is high enough to justify preemptive force.
</em><br>
<p>This is NOT the case in most of the countries we have interfered
<br>
in so I don't see this thought-experiment as being terribly
<br>
relevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If he were just keeping conventional weapons, or could convince me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that his storage methods didn't threaten me, then I'd have to back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off and respect his rights; but if I have cause to believe his actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threaten me, I _do_ have the right to demand that he prove otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or cease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do other countries have the right to demand that the US proves
<br>
its intentions and the safety of its bio-weapons?   Do we have
<br>
the right to insist our assertion is sufficient and to ignore
<br>
any and all restrictions, rulings, demands by any third parties
<br>
we helped set up to monitor and verify the assertions of nations
<br>
in these matters?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's a little harder to make a similar case for Afghanistan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the idea that there's _nothing_ they or any other nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could do that would justify active intervention is nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a total abrogation of the responsibility for self-defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, for example, there were old Soviet nuclear weapons there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would be ethically required to use force to ensure that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government set up there could properly deal with them, or else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would have to remove them by force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I did not say that there was nothing they could do, etc.  I said
<br>
that there is no inherent right that we have to force our
<br>
cultural values and governmental style on another sovereign
<br>
nation.  There is quite a large difference.
<br>
<p>Hmmm.  Most of the old Soviet nuclear weapons are still in
<br>
Russia and there is good reason to believe that they are not
<br>
totally well-managed and safe today.  Are we then ethically
<br>
required to forcefully go in an seize these weapons before they
<br>
come to harm?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It is a difficult and unsolved problem in libertarian ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and politics to determine exactly when and under what conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an imminent threat or danger rises to the level to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defensive force; but there is such a level, and those judgments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do have to be made.  Absolute dogmatic non-interventionism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational and dangerous.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  As it is irrational and dangerous for us to go pull the
<br>
splinter out of another country's eye while ignoring the beam in
<br>
our own.
