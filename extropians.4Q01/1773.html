</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technically civilians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is incorrect. The third Geneva Convention says that prisoners are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not to be tortured. Any other means is perfectly acceptable. Secondly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;war HAS been declared. It was declared by bin Laden 8 years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thirdly, a box cutter is a weapon in the current conflict, and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;four I specifically described all had box cutters or other weapons in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their posession. Troops do not have to be captured at the front lines to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be considered combatants either.
</em><br>
<p>The US has signed conventions that specify that the use of pharmicuticals 
<br>
on prisoners as part of an interogation is torture.  Just because Bin Ladin 
<br>
declared war on us doesn't mean we are legaly at war with him.  A common 
<br>
criminal in the US could declare war on us to try to legitimize his crimes, 
<br>
but it would still be just a criminal case.  Only when a foreign country 
<br>
declares war are we at war with them.  At least four our of the 150 people 
<br>
held did have box cutters, but they were not &quot;borne openly.&quot;  Neither were 
<br>
any of the people arrested in Uniform at the time, or in a occupied 
<br>
territory and under a chain of command (the exception to the uniform 
<br>
rule).  Yes, there are exceptions to the front line rule, but I don't 
<br>
believe any of the conditions were met here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;          Because Bin Laden's network operates on the &quot;need to know&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principle I doubt that any of people we are holding have information that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could be used to prevent other terrorist attacks, at least in the short 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, it doesn't operate in that manner, it operates by a cell system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which is different from 'need to know'. Anyone in a cell is aware of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activities planned by that cell, as well as contacts and cutouts for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subsidiary and superior cells.
</em><br>
<p>An organization that uses a cell structure is different form an 
<br>
organization that uses &quot;need to know&quot; in the same way that extropians 
<br>
differ from transhumanists.  One is a subtype of the other.  Yes, many 
<br>
members of a cell will know about other individuals in the chain of 
<br>
command.  However, they will have no idea what other parralel cell will be 
<br>
doing.  Thus my comment their infromation not preventing other terrorist 
<br>
attacks in the short term.  In the long run we can try and convict them, 
<br>
and then use their infromation to slowly pick apart their organization.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;          Until these people are convicted they deserve the protection of US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; law, including the 5th amendment.  After conviction criminals do have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; give up some rights, and I could live with the use of truth serum so long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as it wasn't &quot;cruel and unusual punishment,&quot; just so long as we are dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sure that these people really were terrorists.  The evidence against these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people was pretty impressive, but the stuff that I know about was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; circumstantial, and so not enough to violate constitutional rights over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Having a) a scheduled flight from Newark to California the day of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attack (that was cancelled), and then heading to a Texas border town
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with box cutters (the preferred weapon of the hijackers) and ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thousand bucks in cash in their posession is far more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circumstantial, especially when one of them was already on the FBI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;watch list. Then you've got Jechariah Moussawi, who 'only wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;learn to fly the plane in the air' and was also on the watch list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you mean that none of their activities, statements, or posessions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could be tied to an actual crime directly, that is obvious, because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were never able to hijack a plane themselves, but it is rather obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they were involved in the plot. Only a complete idiot would think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>OK, it is very, very unlikely that they are innocent.  But if the 
<br>
circmstances had been different, and the 9/11 attack hadn't happened their 
<br>
activities wouldn't have made us suspect them of terrorism.  So although 
<br>
there is very,very strong circumstantial evidense, it is still 
<br>
circumstantial and under our legal system they are innocent until we can 
<br>
prove those bastards guilty.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Finally, I highly doubt that you or Samantha has ANY experience in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dealing with wartime legal issues, dealing with Geneva Conventions, etc.
</em><br>
<p>No, all my knowledge comes from reading the relevant documents.  Do you 
<br>
have any experience with international law as it relates to the treatment 
<br>
of prisoners?
