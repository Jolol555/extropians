Subject: Pentagon looking for a few good ideas
<br>
<p><p>: A few weeks ago our list was full of bright ideas for applying technology
<br>
: to the challenges we face.  Some of them, like irradiating the mail, are
<br>
: independently being put into effect.  Now here is your chance to get an
<br>
: official hearing for your other good ideas.

<br>
:
<br>
:    WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon (news - web sites) cast a wide net
<br>
:    on Thursday for bright ideas on thwarting terrorism, seeking to pick
<br>
:    the brains of just about everyone from tinkerers in their garages to
<br>
:    big corporations worldwide.
<br>
:
<br>
:    The Defense Department said it was seeking help in ''defeating
<br>
:    difficult targets, conducting protracted operations in remote areas
<br>
:    and developing countermeasures to weapons of mass destruction.''
<br>
:    ...
<br>
:    ``We're open to ideas from just about everybody,'' added Glenn Flood,
<br>
:    a Pentagon spokesman. More information on the process has been posted
<br>
:    at <a href="http://www.bids.tswg.gov">http://www.bids.tswg.gov</a>.
<br>
:
<br>
:    Jacques Gansler, who served as the Pentagon's acquisition chief
<br>
:    under former President Bill Clinton, said similar approaches had
<br>
:    worked well for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the
<br>
:    Pentagon's chief research and development arm.
<br>
:
<br>
:    ``The beauty of it is you can get a broad range of people thinking
<br>
:    out of the box,'' he said. ``Often you'll get ideas from inventors''
<br>
:    as well as from big defense contractors.
<br>
:
<br>
: Thinking outside the box is definitely one thing people around here are
<br>
: good at (a little too far outside the box sometimes, perhaps).  If you
<br>
: follow the links from that article you get to the Pentagon solicitation,
<br>
: which outlines the following specific problems where they are looking
