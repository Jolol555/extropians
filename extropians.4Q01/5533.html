From: &quot;Phil Osborn&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:philosborn@altavista.com?Subject=Re:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;01d201c1920f$37a7e7c0$4e5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">philosborn@altavista.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is the short list off the top of my head.  The reality of U.S. justice
</em><br>
is that in spite of having the highest % of people incarcerated in the world,
<br>
most people have little or no recourse within the justice system in dealing
<br>
with actual criminals, such as local gang members shaking them down, trashing
<br>
their homes and vehicles, etc.  If they take matters into their own hands,
<br>
then they risk enormous legal penalties, which have escalated beyond all
<br>
sanity in the past few decades.  And if someone in power doesn't like you,
<br>
there are a multitude of ways to destroy you, or keep you completely defeated
<br>
by endless hassles.
<br>
<p>The &quot;someone in power&quot; that you mention, has more real power than a busload of
<br>
transhumanist technophiles. In case you haven't read it, _Magister Ludi_, by
<br>
Herman Hesse describes a world where a &quot;Glass Bead Game&quot; is played to decide
<br>
the structure of the social hierarchy. In today's America, the glass bead game
<br>
is litigation. The legal system decides your place in society.
<br>
I think the legal system will decide whether Bill Joy's scientific
<br>
relinquishment will prevail or if human-competitive AI will continue to
<br>
evolve. IOW, for AI phase transition to occur, first the singularity will have
<br>
to successfully navigate the legal system.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
