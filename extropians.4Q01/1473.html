My essay which won the first prize in the writing competition from _The
<br>
Economist_ and Shell, &quot;The World In 2050&quot; is now available at the link
<br>
below.  It won't be there for long, though --  I'm sure this site will
<br>
soon be replaced by a new one for The Economist's next annual issue,
<br>
The World In 2002.  The bio overshoots my age by one year (I was 28 at
<br>
the time) because we Yanks write our dates differently from the rest
<br>
of the world.

<br>
<p>For anyone who's interested, I'll post the press release on the competition
<br>
below.  My piece already got pretty good distribution: The Economist's
<br>
issue, &quot;The World In 2001&quot; was distributed in 95 countries and translated
<br>
into seventeen languages, and it was re-printed in _Whole Earth_ magazine,
<br>
but anyway I'm glad to see it's finally been put online, at least for
<br>
a while.
<br>
<p>Best wishes to all,
<br>
<p>Bill

<br>
<p><p>For immediate release
<br>
<p>Prize-winning thinking.  
<br>
<p>Winners announced for 'The World in 2050' writing competition run by
<br>
Shell and The Economist.
<br>
<p><p>The Economist and Shell are pleased to announce the winner of this international
<br>
writing competition, which was launched in April 2000.
<br>
<p>The aim of the competition was to encourage debate and thought about
<br>
the social, political, environmental, technological and economic issues
<br>
that countries, companies and individuals will face in the middle of
<br>
the 21st century.
<br>
<p>William Douglass, age 28, from Houston, Texas beat more than 3000 entrants
<br>
from 75 countries with his essay 'Dear Nestor'.  The essay takes the
<br>
form of a letter written by a young Bangladeshi boy to a friend in the
<br>
USA in a world governed by 'The Network' where oil rigs are obsolete,
<br>
and special genes and limited duration marriages are the norm.
<br>
<p>The judges chose Mr Douglass's entry because of the connection made between
<br>
advances in technology and the unchanging importance of human relationships.
<br>
<p>Bill Emmott said: 'We liked this essay not only because it was compellingly
<br>
written in an accessible form, but also because it artfully included
<br>
ideas both about how life and people might change, and about things which
<br>
might endure.'
<br>
<p>The competition was judged by a panel of experts chaired by Richard O'Brien,
<br>
Partner of Outsights (the international consultancy in external change
<br>
and strategy).  The panel included Esther Dyson, an e-guru and investor;
<br>
Peter Warshall, a biologist and environmentalist; Matt Ridley, a science
<br>
writer, most recently of 'Genome', a much-acclaimed book; Wolfgang Michalski,
<br>
a futurist at the OECD; Jusuf Wanandi, an Indonesian academic specialising
<br>
in strategic studies;
<br>
Bill Emmott, editor of The Economist; and Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman
<br>
of the Committee of Managing Directors of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
<br>
<p>William Douglass will receive a prize of US$20,000 and his essay will
<br>
appear in The Economist's annual publication, 'The World in 2001', published
<br>
in November 2000.  Two second prizes of $10,000 are
<br>
awarded to Paul Gordon and Robert Carlson, and five third prizes of $5,000
<br>
go to Peter Baker, Alain Boxhammer, Paul Copeland, Peter John and Martin
<br>
Smith.
<br>
<p>Sir Mark Moody-Stuart said: 'What has been impressive about this competition
<br>
is the range and scope of entries.  From space exploration through to
<br>
environmental sustainability, it is clear that there are common themes
<br>
of concern and debate that are shared across the world.  As well as offering
<br>
congratulations to the prizewinners, I'd like to say a big thank-you
<br>
to everyone who made the effort to share with us their vision of what
<br>
the world will be like in 2050.'
