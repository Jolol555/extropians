<p>
THE creation of a real-life cyborg, the part-human, part-machine character
<br>
made famous in Hollywood blockbusters like Robocop and The Terminator, has
<br>
moved a step closer.
<br>
<a href="http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/29-10-19101-0-45-38.html">http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/archive/29-10-19101-0-45-38.html</a>
<br>
<p>Scientists in Germany have succeeded in melding living nerve cells and silicon
<br>
to create the world's first neuronal chip. The neuron cell allows the passage
<br>
of nerve impulses.
<br>
<p>The breakthrough, linking nerve cells from a snail and a chip, opens the door
<br>
to the sci-fi world of cyborg technology, and a double-edged sword for
<br>
science: the technology could lead to computers with living brains and
<br>
implants that can repair damaged spinal cords or eyes.
<br>
<p>The former is a vision of half-living machines, with the ability to think
<br>
creatively for themselves.
<br>
<p>However, rather than Blade Runner or the more recent example of the genre,
<br>
Artificial Intelligence, becoming reality, scientists appear determined that
<br>
their discoveries are used in life- enhancing ways.
<br>
<p>Peter Fromherz and Gunther Zeck, from the Max Planck institute for
<br>
biochemistry in Munich, Germany, were the ones who succeeded in linking the
<br>
snail cells and the chip.
<br>
<p>The magazine, Physics World, reported the chip contains an array of cells
<br>
enclosed by &quot;picket fences&quot; which allow the connection to be maintained as the
<br>
cells grow. An electrical signal passes from the silicon into a neuron, and
<br>
can then move into a neighbouring neuron along a link. The signal then passes
<br>
back into the chip to complete the circuit, just like a conventional silicon
<br>
switch.
<br>
<p>Bruce Wheeler, from the electrical and computer engineering department at the
<br>
University of Illinois in America, said: &quot;The work has an element of vision
<br>
that will excite future generations of scientists.&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
