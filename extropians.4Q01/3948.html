<p><em>&gt; Would not a judge determine whether a child was yours or not?
</em><br>
<p>If the judge makes the determination based on DNA evidence (as they
<br>
now seem to do) I don't see where there is a problem.  The chances
<br>
of it being a wrong decision are very low and subject to being
<br>
corrected by additional tests.  If it isn't my genetic child then
<br>
I have no moral obligation to support it.  (I'm unsure how the
<br>
&quot;legal&quot; situation works -- I suspect at a minimum the genetic
<br>
father would be required to pay child support.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if there exists, a situation where a child does not result, yet infidelity is still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undertaken? Wouldn't a person still feel betrayed by the infidelity? Are we, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the highest of anthrpoid apes, still driven exclusively, by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic/behavioral determinism, or are we as intelligences, slightly, more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ego-bound?
</em><br>
<p>It depends entirely on the degree to which a person has allowed either
<br>
their personal survival or emotional well being to become intertwined
<br>
with their partner.  I personally don't see much value in regulating
<br>
the behavior of other adults.  So I doubt I'd feel &quot;betrayed&quot; by
<br>
infidelity.  I might feel some emotional loss if such a situation
<br>
arose unexpectedly (e.g. a partner had indicated they had wanted to be
<br>
faithful but had accidentally strayed) but since I know what is
<br>
generating those feelings (the genetic/memetic &quot;jealousy&quot; machine)
<br>
I'm not going to place a high value on them.
