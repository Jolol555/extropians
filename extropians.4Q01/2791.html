World's Smallest Mini-Robot
<br>
<a href="http://www.buscom.com/letters/iitpromo/iit/iit.html#hed8">http://www.buscom.com/letters/iitpromo/iit/iit.html#hed8</a>
<br>
A robot that &quot;turns on a dime and parks on a nickel&quot; is being developed by
<br>
researchers at the Dept. of Energy's Sandia National Laboratory (Albuquerque,
<br>
NM; Tel: 505/ 844-0611). At one-quarter cubic inch and weighing less than an
<br>
ounce, this device is possibly the smallest autonomous untethered robot ever
<br>
created. Powered by three watch batteries, it rides on track wheels and
<br>
consists of an 8K ROM processor, temperature sensor, and two motors that drive
<br>
the wheels. Additions being considered include a miniature camera, microphone,
<br>
communications device, and chemical microsensor.
<br>
<p>Ed Heller, one of the project's researchers says, &quot;This could be the robot of
<br>
the future. It may eventually be capable of performing difficult tasks that
<br>
are done with much larger robots today-such as locating and disabling land
<br>
mines or detecting chemical and biological weapons.&quot;
<br>
<p>He says it could, for example, scramble through pipes or prowl around
<br>
buildings looking for chemical plumes or human movement. The robots may be
<br>
capable of relaying information to a human operated station and communicating
<br>
with each other. They will be able to work together in swarms, like insects.
<br>
The miniature robots will be able to go into locations too small for their
<br>
larger relatives. The mini-robot has already maneuvered its way through a
<br>
field of dimes and nickels and travels at about 20 in. a minute. It can sit
<br>
easily on a nickel.
<br>
<p>The newest robot miniaturization research supports laboratories directed
<br>
research and development (LDRD) work started in Sandia's intelligent systems
<br>
sensors and controls department. In 1996, the department unveiled a mini
<br>
autonomous robot vehicle (MARV), a one cubic inch robot that contained all the
<br>
necessary power, sensors, computers, and controls on board. It was made
<br>
primarily from commercial parts using conventional machining techniques.
<br>
<p>Over the next several years, the department improved the original MARV. The
<br>
bodies of the robots were made of printed circuit boards, and each had an
<br>
obstacle detector sensor, radio, temperature sensor, and batteries. At 1.6 by
<br>
0.75 by 0.71 in., they were still larger than desired.
<br>
<p>Sandia roboticist Ray Byrne, who was involved in the LDRD efforts, says that
<br>
about three years ago the Intelligent Systems and Robotics Center teamed with
<br>
Sandia's sensor technologies department to further miniaturize the robots.
<br>
They sought the department's expertise in building sensors and other devices
<br>
on a miniature scale. By trying new electronic packaging techniques, wheel
<br>
design, and body materials, the new team shrunk the robots to one-quarter
<br>
cubic inch.
<br>
<p>Commercially available unpackaged electronic parts were one important
<br>
innovation. Using electronic components in die form reduced the size of the
<br>
robot considerably. The unpackaged parts are assembled onto a simple
<br>
multi-chip module on a glass substrate.
<br>
<p>A new rapid prototyping technique called stereolithography was used to form
<br>
the body of the device. This technique lays down a very thin polymer deposit
<br>
that is cured by a laser. The material, which grows as each layer is added, is
<br>
light-weight, strong, and can be formed into complex shapes. The robot bodies
<br>
have cavities for batteries, electronics embedded glass substrates, axles,
<br>
tiny motors, switches, and other parts.
<br>
<p>The ultimate size of the robots is limited by the size of the power source-the
<br>
three watch batteries. Over the next few years, the team hopes to use smaller
<br>
batteries, add either infrared or radio wireless two way communications,
<br>
miniature video cameras, and chemical microsensors. Contact: Doug Adkins; Tel:

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,

analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual

non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
