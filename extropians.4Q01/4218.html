Say you walk into a store that makes perfect copies of people. You know
<br>
before hand you are going to copy yourself. You remember being put to sleep
<br>
for the process. As a joke, while the two beings with identical memories,
<br>
etc. are sleeping the doctors decide to put you both in a human shuffling
<br>
machine where when each person came out nobody knew who was who.
<br>
<p>Now both beings wake up. Which one is you?
<br>
Same body. Same personality. Same memories. Which one is you? Are you the
<br>
one who was put to sleep and came in that day to be cloned? Or was that the
<br>
other you and you are just the copy?

Subject: Sincere Questions on Identity
<br>
<p><p>Sincerely, I hate to bring this subject up again, but it has been running
<br>
through my mind.  It seems a good number of the people on this list support
<br>
the assertion that a copy is 'you'.  I have been taking the stance (along
<br>
with a minority it appears) that a copy is not you, but it is a copy.  I
<br>
consider everyone I have interacted with and read posts from on this forum
<br>
very intelligent, and the lack of interest in this subject or responding to
<br>
my arguments suggest, to me at least, that perhaps my stance is wrong.  If
<br>
so many well learned people do not consider the question important enough to
<br>
reply to, then perhaps they know something that I do not.  Because this is
<br>
an issue of great importance to me (a matter of life and death, so to speak)
<br>
I was wondering if, perhaps, someone can enlighten me on the fallacies of my
<br>
argument.  It is vitally important for me that I feel comfortable in the
<br>
manner in which I may end up surviving bodily death and that hopefully it
<br>
will indeed be 'me' and not a copy of me.  But people on this list feel that
<br>
a 'copy' of me is actually indistinguishable from me, or IS me.  I would
<br>
like to learn as much as I can about this position, as I am striving to
<br>
figure out what the most likely and simplest explanation for observed
<br>
phenomena is.  If the heart of this argument can be relayed to me, perhaps I
<br>
will be able to feel solace in a copy of me surviving.  Thanks for your
<br>
input.
<br>
<p>So far, the only arguments I have identified that argues against the
<br>
'continuity of consciousness' argument is the 'how do I know it hasn't
<br>
happened already' form and the 'you aren't made of the atoms you were made
<br>
of before'
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------------------------
<br>
<p>For some example of the 'How do you know argument' from responses to my
<br>
comments...
<br>
<p>&quot;I, for one, cannot see the slightest value in &quot;continuity of
<br>
consciousness&quot;, whatever that is.  How is being destroyed and restored
<br>
from a backup any different from the perfectly ordinary experience of taking
<br>
a whack on the head a waking up a few minutes later?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Its *you* as of the time of the backup if the backup and restoration
<br>
methods are completely loss less.  Any other perspective is to argue
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; has some basis in non-physical phenomena.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Your consciousness continues just like it would if you got bumped on the
<br>
head and &quot;forgot&quot; the last three days of your life&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The continuity of consciousness view seems to be held by at least some
<br>
transhumanists. How this view can be held when many people have clearly
<br>
lived through a period of complete cessation of neural activity I don't
<br>
know.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;how can you be sure that you don't die every night when you go to sleep and
<br>
that the conscious being who awakes the next morning is not a copy with the
<br>
same memories?
<br>
<p>&quot;If you were copied and murdered last night would you feel one bit different
<br>
today?&quot;
<br>
<p>I feel I have to delve into philosophy of science a little bit here.
<br>
Getting copied in a destructive manner is different from getting whacked on
<br>
the head and waking up a few minutes later in a few key areas 1) getting
<br>
whacked on the head does not destroy you 2) and the mechanism that houses
<br>
your consciousness never changes.  There is no reason to suspect that I am a
<br>
different person (i.e. a copy) after getting whacked on the head because
<br>
there is no evidence suggesting that is the case.
<br>
<p>I would argue that anything suggesting a continuity of consciousness between
<br>
an original and a copy necessarily implies that there is some supernatural
<br>
element to consciousness, unless you acknowledge that the copy is a
<br>
different being.  Otherwise some common perceptual sense must hop from
<br>
original to copy, that would be unreasonable to assume scientifically.
<br>
<p>Living through a session of complete neural cessation also does not involve
<br>
the changing of the physical mechanism housing the consciousness.  It is
<br>
pretty obvious that going to sleep and waking up or experiencing a short
<br>
period of being clinically dead and then revived is a far cry from
<br>
physically incinerating a body and every atom and molecule and then
<br>
constructing an identical copy of it, as one scenario involves destruction
<br>
of some kind, and the other does not.  How the view that these two scenarios
<br>
are indistinguishable can be held by a rational scientifically minded person
<br>
I don't know.
<br>
<p>I can be reasonable sure that when I go to sleep at night I don't die for a
<br>
few reasons 1) Hooking me up to any kind of machine that measures brain
<br>
activity would never measure any absolute cessation in activity 2) My mind
<br>
and or body is not observed, on a nightly basis, to violently disappear in a
<br>
great flash of energy and the to suddenly reappear a few moments later in
<br>
another flash of energy 3) The molecules and atoms that make up my mind and
<br>
house my consciousness are never observed to change form or shape during the
<br>
course of the evening.  In short, if all the evidence that exists suggest
<br>
that I am the same person, physically and psychically, when I went to sleep,
<br>
it is reasonable and scientific to assume that I am the same person that
<br>
wakes up.
<br>
<p>I can also be reasonably sure that I was not murdered last night for the
<br>
same reasons above, in addition to the fact that no evidence suggest any
<br>
sort of violent struggle or murder, e.g. brains and blood splattered all
<br>
over the wall, with DNA that matches mine.
<br>
<p>To elaborate a little further, there is a principle in science referred to
<br>
as Occam's Razor, that is 'The simplest explanation tends to be the correct
<br>
one' or it is assumed to be the correct one depending on your
<br>
interpretation.  A prime example is the question of the existence of the
<br>
Universe.  If one is to say that the universe exists and the reason for that
<br>
is that God created the universe, the next question obviously is who created
<br>
god.  Only three logical possibilities exist, 1) that god created himself,
<br>
2) that he was created by another god or 3) that he was always there.  If
<br>
one presumes that the universe must have been created because it is so
<br>
complex, then it would follow that any being that created the universe must
<br>
be pretty complex as well to create such a complex thing.  Yet this just
<br>
moves the goal post back, who created this more complex being?  If you
<br>
assume that God created itself or was always there, then it is just
<br>
reasonable to assume that the universe created itself or was always there,
<br>
in fact, once you add an arbitrary concept when attempting to explain
<br>
something (the presence of the universe) then it makes no difference to add
<br>
an infinite number of them.  For example, saying the Universe was created by
<br>
God is functionally no different then saying the universe was created by God
<br>
who was created by another god who was created by a giant turtle who was
<br>
created by a giant robot who was created by a super alien ad infanitum.
<br>
There is no evidence to distinguish these lines of reasoning, the only line
<br>
of reasoning that is scientifically supported is that the Universe exists,
<br>
and does not require a supernatural source.
<br>
<p>Similarly, saying that while you sleep it is possible you were destroyed,
<br>
copied, and resurrected is adding arbitrary entities to an observed
<br>
situation.  If observed one would find that I sleep through the night,
<br>
undisturbed, no murders, no transporters, no spontaneous flashes of energy
<br>
associated with my body vaporizing.  Since none of these things can be
<br>
observed to occur, arguing that they could have because you cant prove other
<br>
wise is anti scientific, as you can not prove a negative, and these
<br>
occurrences are arbitrary entities not based in any factual observations.
<br>
<p>Conversely, should I be destroyed, copied, then resurrected, the instances
<br>
could indeed be observed.  The destroying, the massive room sized scanner
<br>
moving and spinning around my head, and the room sized molecular
<br>
construction system creating a copy of me.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------
<br>
<p>The 'you are always changing' argument, example from responses to my post...
<br>
<p>&quot;What exactly do you mean by &quot;The Original&quot; anyway, all your atoms are in a
<br>
constant state of flux, you really aren't the man you were a year ago.&quot;
<br>
<p>As I pointed out in my original response to this, replacing one atom at a
<br>
time is far different from replacing all atoms at once.  The actual process
<br>
the brain goes through ends up slowly replacing your atoms and molecules
<br>
over a vast length of time, any particular atom could remain in the system
<br>
for years on end.  Comparing this slow repairing and modifying process with
<br>
a rapid total destruction of a system is logically fallacious.  The RATE of
<br>
the replacement is the key difference.  My atoms are replaced over a wide
<br>
spanse of time, and at any given time the majority of the physiological
<br>
mechanism that makes up my brain and my consciousness is unaffected.  If you
<br>
compare the difference between replacing one neuron at a time with a
<br>
hardware equivalent vs. replacing ALL of them through a destructive scanning
<br>
method, it becomes obvious that there is quite a functional difference
<br>
between then two.  It seems unreasonable to think replacing ONE neuron of
<br>
100 billion billion neurons has the same effect as replacing 100 billion
<br>
billion neurons while destroying the original neurons.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------
<br>
<p>Harvey, in response to my comments later says when summing up the arguments
<br>
<p>&quot;The argument finally boils down, in my opinion, to semantics.  Given the
<br>
definition of identity that claims the two copies are separate, we can prove
<br>
that the two copies are separate.  Given the definition of identity that
<br>
claims all copies are the same individual, we can prove that all copies are
<br>
the same individual.&quot;
<br>
<p>Anders says
<br>
<p>&quot;The problem is that we end up in semantics while really trying to say
<br>
something relevant about selfhood.&quot;
<br>
<p>This sounds like circular reasoning to me, that is, assuming the conclusion
<br>
as a premise.  If we look at the simplest explanation that the evidence
<br>
points to, it is reasonable to assume (and scientific) that you do not die
<br>
and get copied while you sleep, and that you are the same person after being
<br>
whacked on the head.  I do not see it as a semantics argument, as we are not
<br>
arguing about the definition of what it means to be me.  We are making an
<br>
observational claim that if you were to copy my neural pattern and recreate
<br>
it with a new set of atoms and molecules, that 'person' which is both a
<br>
neural pattern and a group of molecules exists independently from me, and I
<br>
am not aware of its thoughts and hopes and dreams, and it is not aware of
<br>
mine.
<br>
<p><p>Damien later says
<br>
<p>&quot;This *doesn't* mean their fallible sense of conviction is *valid*, any more
<br>
than a surviving soldier's faith in God supports the existence of this
<br>
imaginary contrivance--although in both cases, I'm sure the experience would
<br>
`confirm' the prejudice.&quot;
<br>
<p>Important point to emphasize, no matter how strongly one believes something
<br>
to be true, whether a copy is me or whether a copy is not, it has no bearing
<br>
upon reality and the way the world actually works.  In fact, to determine
<br>
the way the world works, we must examine it through tests and experiments.
<br>
If I am most concerned with myself surviving physical death, I should be
<br>
concerned with the way the universe actually works.  A simple thought
<br>
experiment seems to me reasonable enough to prove that a copy is not me, as
<br>
I mentioned before, if a copy is made with a passive scanning system and we
<br>
are both revived, do we perceive the same thing?  If my copy is brought to
<br>
another room, can I see what it sees?  If so, I would concur that we are the
<br>
same individual being, and that I would have had continuity of consciousness
<br>
had I not been revived, but this indeed would imply some sort of
<br>
supernatural link between the entities.  But since I probably could not see
<br>
what he sees or experience what he experiences, it is certainly reasonable
<br>
to assume that he is NOT me, and that I would have had no continuity
<br>
consciousness, and that he is a copy.
<br>
<p>Even Max acknowledges this when he says
<br>
<p>&quot;Parfitians (myself included) tend to agree with some functionalists and
<br>
disagree with John, saying that an identical copy of me is not me&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, he goes on to downplay the importance of this distinction,
<br>
stating that
<br>
<p>&quot;we don't think that identity is what matters. What matters is psychological
<br>
connectedness and continuity.&quot;
<br>
<p>It may not matter to him, directly, if he survives bodily death in a
<br>
continous manner of awareness, but it would matter to me.
<br>
<p>Now, the point must be conceded that if ones top priority was to bring the
<br>
things they would have brought into the world in, then a copy will certainly
<br>
suffice.  I would like to think that I can bring something into the world
<br>
from my existence, so having a copy would be preferable over no copy, but it
<br>
still is not *me* as far as the evidence suggests and I would not experience
<br>
a continuity of consciousness and for all intents and purposes could be
<br>
considered dead.  I would place the highest priority on my continuity of
<br>
consciousness, followed closely by a copy being brought into existence.
<br>
But, I think, in this case, if reality can not prove a stance either way, it
<br>
would be best to err on the side of caution.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------
<br>
<p>Some other comments I received...
<br>
<p>&quot;I believe that if the copy has all your thoughts and experiences, and a
<br>
continuity of consciousness, then he (not it) feels like &quot; the
<br>
original you&quot; has perceived a waking up sensation. I would say that this
<br>
statement is identical to &quot;the original me perceives a waking up
<br>
sensation&quot;.
<br>
<p>and...
<br>
<p>&quot;I think that if the copy feels continuity between the original you and
<br>
himself, then you wake up and live on. Unfortunately there appears to be no
<br>
way to establish an operative difference between this position and yours.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think that the thought experiment I relayed above suggests there is an
<br>
operative difference between these positions.  If the premise is that a copy
<br>
is me, then since I am aware of things I do, and a copy is me, I should be
<br>
aware of the things a copy does.  It does not seem likely that this would be
<br>
the case if this experiment were actually performed.  Though I must admit I
<br>
would be glad if it did turn out this way.
<br>
<p>Lee Daniel Crocker suggested that the argument is pointless and it is more
<br>
important to discuss the rights of the copy, stating
<br>
<p>&quot;These are actual questions of fact, and concerns to think about. Which of
<br>
the lumps of flesh is &quot;me&quot; is just mental masturbation.&quot;
<br>
<p>But I must disagree, since this assertion is testable under these
<br>
circumstances.  Again, If a copy is me, and I experience the things I do,
<br>
then it follows that I would experience the things a copy does, since that
<br>
copy is me.  This is an easily testable phenomena, but I think we can guess
<br>
what the outcome of the test would be until it is a test that is
<br>
performable.
<br>
<p>In conclusion, I am really trying to understand what I am missing in this
<br>
argument, if so many people are so sure the point is irrelevant, what am I
<br>
not realizing?
<br>
<p>Given the though experiment outlined &quot;....  If we copied your neural pattern
<br>
and created a duplicate of it, while still keeping you intact, and woke you
<br>
both up, what would happen?  If we took your copy into another room, would
<br>
you be experiencing subjectively what your copy was?  I doubt it.  Therefore
<br>
the copies 'waking up' and continuity of consciousness is different and
<br>
isolated from yours.&quot;  what would be a good argument discrediting the
<br>
validity of this thought experiment.
<br>
<p>Concerned about my well being...
