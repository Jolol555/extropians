</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Back when I first heard about extropians, one of the major attractions for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me was the combination of transhumanism and libertarianism.  In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that's how I thought of extropians -- as libertarian transhumanists.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  Just because some extropians are libertarian would you think that it 
<br>
was a personality trait of all extropians?   I think that it is essential 
<br>
to realize that some ideas that are known to be intelligent have been 
<br>
accepted and taken on by libertarians.  This does not mean that they are 
<br>
exclusively libertarian.   They are simply smart ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure what distinguishes extropy from plain transhumanism, if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advocacy of non-statism.  Can someone help me out here?
</em><br>
<p>Good question.  Actually, basically nothing other than a word 
<br>
&quot;Extropy&quot;.  Now, if we begin to unravel some of the history of how 
<br>
transhumanism got stated you would learn that there were Upwinger 
<br>
Transhumanists, Transhumanist Artists and other smaller groups of futurists 
<br>
who felt aligned with the transhumanist futurism.  But, really, the word 
<br>
and ideas were first generated in the extropian community.  The word 
<br>
transhumanism came out of the extropian philosophy.  Not the other way 
<br>
around.  However, FM-2030, wrote his view of what a transhuman is and I 
<br>
think that his &quot;ideology&quot; was significantly transhumanist.  There was no 
<br>
political spin on transhumanism other than FM's views ideological globalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In any case, cryofan didn't mention any parties, and in fact used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;libertarian&quot; (associated with the non-statist or minarchist belief system)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than &quot;Libertarian&quot; (associated with the party, which is arguably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minarchist, but certainly not non-statist).
</em><br>
<p>His inference was pretty darn strong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By the way, I imagine that &quot;a-political&quot; could easily be used to describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarianism. :)
</em><br>
<p>Sure. I guess so.  Frankly, I think political parties are old world.
