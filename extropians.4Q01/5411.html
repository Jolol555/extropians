<p>There's now http spam? Wow. I presume he means ads, especially the popup
<br>
variety. (Some jokers will even attempt crashing your machine by keeping
<br>
opening up new windows, another good reason to disable ECMA/JavaScript.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; signs of decay, says John Dvorak. But is there anything we can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it?
</em><br>
<p>The browser wars and consumers clamoring for features make the world wide
<br>
web an increasingly balkanized environment (for the same reason the
<br>
browser as an ubiquitous all-purpose client becomes rapidly uninteresting,
<br>
due to severe incompatibilities and combinatorial explosion rendering
<br>
testing prohibitively expensive).
<br>
<p>So, we need standards. Noncommercial standards, of course, ones immune to
<br>
customer base locking as being practiced by all major players. Mozilla and
<br>
Galeon could become rather important here.
<br>
<p>As to search engines, Google is doing okay now, but we need full text
<br>
indexing built into all mainstream web servers, including P2P search
<br>
engines.
<br>
<p>We also need micrograin digicash for resource allocation and load
<br>
levelling, as pioneered by Mojo Nation. I would still like to see more
<br>
disciplines adopting a grassroot publishing approach to papers
<br>
publication, as pioneered by <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov">http://xxx.lanl.gov</a> .
<br>
<p>Furthermore, we need to make content immune to filtering and persistant.
<br>
The best approaches to date are Mojo Nation <a href="http://www.mojonation.net">http://www.mojonation.net</a>
<br>
(they're down for the moment) and Freenet <a href="http://freenetproject.org/">http://freenetproject.org/</a>
<br>
They're rather useful already, and I hope at some point will migrate into
<br>
default installation of open source OSses. (Redmond won't do this, because
<br>
they're now into content control, so empowerment of the end user runs
<br>
contrary to their business goals).
<br>
<p>And, of course, we need people to still believe into voicing their
<br>
thoughts publicly. There's far too much frivolous content out there, and
<br>
the effort going into creating a set of pages looks like too much work for
<br>
too many people.
<br>
<p>Btw, I've recently started looking into different web hosts, and stuck
<br>
with <a href="http://phpwebhosting.com">http://phpwebhosting.com</a> . Their $9.95/month plan looks rather good,
<br>
considering the features. You'll still need a registrar, of course, if you
<br>
want your own domain and not blahblah.phpwebhosting.com . I'm rather happy
<br>
with <a href="http://totalnic.net/">http://totalnic.net/</a> , but there are probably cheaper registrars than
<br>
that by now.
<br>
<p>So, what can you do about it? Create nontrivial online content. Keep it
<br>
small, but high quality. And make it a habit updating it.
