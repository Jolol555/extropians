<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Given that intolerant and absolutist memes can by definition exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; within a tolerant and relativist society, but not vice versa, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; strategies can the tolerant and relativist society use to survive?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Will these strategies require it to relinquish some of its tolerance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and relativism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The tolerant and relativist societies can maintain substantial military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superiority using superior economic and technological capabilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's why Afghanistan hasn't conquered America.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. This is criticized as a contradictory stance-- not only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relinquishment of tolerance and relativism, but a selective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relinquishment...
</em><br>
<p>You are confused.  First, I'm not sure the absolutist/relativist
<br>
distinction has any relevance here.  Tolerance is about allowing ideas
<br>
to be expressed by others, and allowing peaceful actions of others,
<br>
even if you judge those ideas and actions to be wrong.  Absolutism
<br>
and relativism are about your criteria for judging them: I am an
<br>
absolutist, for example.  I beleive one should judge the rightness
<br>
or wrongness of ideas and actions on objective criteria, not on
<br>
local culture, custom, or prejudice.  But that doesn't in any
<br>
way affect my tolerance of other to speak and behave in ways I
<br>
judge to be wrong.  SO I am a tolerant absolutist; I've met many,
<br>
many, intolerant relativists as well.
<br>
<p><p>A tolerant society allows all ideas to be expressed; it even allows
<br>
actions many people find objectionable so long as they are done with
<br>
consent of all parties affected, but even the most liberal society
<br>
cannot tolerate coercive and violent actions except in self-defense,
<br>
and even to most peaceful society must occasionally itself respond
<br>
to such actions with defensive force.  It is not acceptable to allow
<br>
murderers to run free, for example; they must be forcibly detained
<br>
and prevented from killing others.
<br>
<p>Eli's point is quite valid: a tolerant society in which ideas are
<br>
expressed freely will result in better technologies, including those
<br>
technologies that are useful for defense.  And such a society will
<br>
recognize that using them is necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In order to maintain this strategy, it is shielded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from public debate and scrutiny. The resulting lack of accountability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows instruments of the open society's foreign policy to lose sight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their original goals and even act in opposition to them. 
</em><br>
<p>No, an open society is totally up front about its technical capabilites
<br>
and its military power, and uses them openly for publicly-stated
<br>
reasons, and is accountable for their use.  To the extent that our
<br>
society keeps foreign policy secret, that needs to change.  But that's
<br>
not a failure of the open society idea, that's a failure of our
<br>
specific society to live up to the idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1a. Furthermore, when an ends-justify-means calculus is employed, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up with the problem of entrusting somebody with the priviledged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position of deciding which ends justify which which means. Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly AI might do it Eliezer, but even the best intentioned humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitably lapse into &quot;MY ends justify the means&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Again, how is this at all relevant to the argument given?  Yes, evil
<br>
people do evil things.  No kidding.  How is this in any way related to
<br>
the idea that tolerant societies will have a better military AND more
<br>
open policies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. Superior technology and economy does not necesserily trump a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superior strategic position. Witness American Revolution, siege of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stalingrad, Italy's invasion of Ethiopia, Vietnam War, Chechnya, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course our current war against a delocalized enemy with wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular support.
</em><br>
<p>In the long run, it does.  Sure, there will be setbacks, but a closed
<br>
society is self-defeating: even if it wins one war, its closedness
<br>
will cause it to fall even further behind and lose the power to
<br>
maintain itself.  It will be beseiged by rebellion from within.  Even
<br>
tolerant-minded people will not stand idly by while government use
<br>
force to oppress and murder their citizens--they can and will rebel,
<br>
and establish new order, just as we did here, or else they will
<br>
leave for somewhere else, and the remains of the intolerant society
<br>
will collapse from brain-drain.
