<p><p><em>&gt; 2 - How do hive insects evolve??? The genes involved in reproduction seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from the queen &amp; drones, who are far removed from the survival of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hive. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would guess that drones must evolve to be better at mating with the queen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the rest of it is a bit trickier. Are whole colonies analogous to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single organism in terms of reproductive fitness? If so, then we have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that colonies are actually asexual reproducers, in that they split to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce; two colonies do not combine their DNA to form an offspring. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, if the colony's reproduction is actually the splitting of the colony,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the production of individual insects is more akin to the creation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new cells in a human body, and plays the same role in terms of reproduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the colony; that is, not much of a role at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was under the impression that the queen only mates when she leaves 
<br>
the hive where she was hatched, while seaking out a new place for a hive. I 
<br>
vaguely remember half hearing something along these lines on a National 
<br>
geographic yawnfest. I thought it odd at the time and wondered how it worked. 
<br>
I know that other Animals/Insects can store sperm or the male germ cells 
<br>
internally for fairly long periods. They then use these reserves to fertilise 
<br>
eggs when nessesary.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen mating Ants on hot summer days. Where the large queens are 
<br>
coupled with smaller also winged ants. Im not sure whether a queens can mate 
<br>
mutiple times and therefor store a broader gene pool of male germ cells ready 
<br>
for when she has established her new hive. This would make reproductive sense.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my understanding that the queen comes from one hive and the smaller 
<br>
ants (call them kings for want of a better word, im not sure if they are just 
<br>
winged drones)
<br>
come from another hive. Then the reproductive process isn't Asexual and two 
<br>
colonies do combine their DNA. Therefor evolution would be fairly normal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that ant colonies do sometimes split for reasons such as 
<br>
overpopulation or climate change. This would also make reproductive sense as 
<br>
it increases the chance of a successfull gene survival by reducing the impact 
<br>
of major catastrophic events like the dreaded &quot;Hungry Ant Eater attack&quot; or a 
<br>
kettle full of boiling water.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this has brought a few questions to mind:
<br>
<p>1. If the queen does store male germ cells for the duration of her reign (not 
<br>
sure how long that is, but I believe it can be years). How does she keep said 
<br>
germ cells alive ?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obviously she doesn't have a tank of liquid nitrogen and a couple of 
<br>
plastic straws to hand. So there must be some nifty biologicall process at 
<br>
work on either the part of the queen or the cells themselves. I think 
<br>
research into this could yield some interesting technologies or processes for 
<br>
increasing the longevity of cells. 
<br>
<p>2. If the queen stores cells from multiple males. Do the rival cells fight, 
<br>
as in the case of human and other sperm ?.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, no problem. But it would make reproductive sense for the male 
<br>
cells to try to destroy any rivals. If this is the case How does the queen 
<br>
stop this process, or does she use the remaining live cells after they have 
<br>
fought. Which would probably be the fittest ?.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cant believe my mind has wondered this far from the original &quot;where 
<br>
are the ants going and why?&quot; question.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Spike  :o)
<br>
