<p>Yes. Apparently this was very effective too, given the near-total
<br>
conversion of the regions where it was used. It seem to not have been
<br>
used in other regions and times such as the Ottoman Empire, and this
<br>
might be part of the explanation (together with physical isolation) why
<br>
so many ethnic and religious groups remained unassimilated.
<br>
<p>If we leave out the obvious coercive nature of taxation and the issue of
<br>
whether a government should actively or passively promote ideological
<br>
memesets (of course they shouldn't, IMHO), it seems that this taxation
<br>
approach is a fairly benign form of memetic engineering compared to
<br>
coercive attempts to force changes in behavior. It imposes a cost on
<br>
certain actions, but does not prevent them. I still find it unacceptable
<br>
that other people impose arbitrary costs on our actions (they can impose
<br>
arbitrary *rewards* all right, though - a reward can always be ignored, 
<br>
but not a cost), but for its time it was amazingly enlightened - compare
<br>
that to the Christian approach of &quot;convert or die&quot;.
<br>
<p>(both approaches were combined in the Swedish kings' conversion/conquest
<br>
of Finland and the Baltics - &quot;convert and pay taxes or die and pay
<br>
taxes!&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll comment by simply asking the question of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;Why is the Islamic faith now followed by ~1 billion people?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly a majority of them were taught by their parents -- but
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While, I do not place Islam in the box that Spike does (Kill the infidels),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I cannot ignore the fact that it seems *highly* likely that many conversions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Islam were the result of coercion.  This is particularly true if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;tax the 'infidels'&quot; policy is accurate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, going back to the PBS special, it is clear that the rise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Ottoman Empire was based on &quot;warrior princes&quot; where ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth had to be proved by conquest.  Cannons were invented by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islamic warriors to conquer Constantinople.  See:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/english/osmanli/osmanli-istanbul.html">http://www.kultur.gov.tr/english/osmanli/osmanli-istanbul.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Islamic &quot;expansion&quot; was halted in Spain and Bulgaria.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, while &quot;protecting&quot; Islam, has to acknowledge that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is questionable how non-violent its initial expansion once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was.  Policies of &quot;warrior princes&quot; that use religions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;dehumanize&quot; infidel opponents are certainly of value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lack of &quot;rejecting&quot; such policies by religious leaders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is essentialy abandoning the religion into the service of aims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that require violent means to an end.
</em><br>
<p>This is where history is important - we are talking about a nearly
<br>
thousand year period across three continents. The culture and religion
<br>
of Arabia in 700, Tunisia in 900, the Kaliphate, Spain during the
<br>
Reconquista, the Ottoman Empire and the region of today have changed a
<br>
*lot*. The taxation approach, I think was mainly used in northern africa
<br>
and the Kaliphate during the early era, when Islam was very much the
<br>
liberal religion. A lot of the conversions in Egypt seems to have been
<br>
due to widespread dislike of the previous Byzantine overlords.
<br>
<p>I think it is important to remember that at this time, the concept of a
<br>
*faith based* as opposed to a *custom based* religion was only starting
<br>
to take hold. Most people were handling religion like it is handled
<br>
today in Japan (and most of the US :-), as a matter of what ceremonies,
<br>
customs and temples to attend to, rather than a deep personal statement
<br>
of faith in a certain vision of the universe. So the conquest was to a
<br>
large extent military, the religious change was relatively secondary to
<br>
many people's lives. 
<br>
<p>The tolerant Islam of the Kaliphate eventually got rather rigid, but a
<br>
partial reason for this seems to have been the Crusades, starting at
<br>
1096. Here is a *nasty* analogy with the current situation: apparently,
<br>
much of the initial tolerance waned just because of the attacks, when
<br>
the rulers of the islamic world rallied to repulse the invaders and
<br>
dissent became unacceptable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While the Christian &quot;meme set&quot; has a seductive hook (everlasting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salvation) I am unsure as to what ideas in the Islamic faith have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;trumping&quot; meme.  If there are no trumping memes one can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude that Islam has been spread primarily by violence and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercion.
</em><br>
<p>It has the same hooks, remember that it is partially based on the same
<br>
holy texts. If Judaism is MsDos, Christianity is Windows 3.1 and Islam
<br>
Windows 95 - older parts are subsumed inside the new system and given
<br>
new meanings. (I *know* somebody is going to get angry at that analogy
<br>
:-) Islam promises eternal life in paradise for the faithful, the relief
<br>
of prayer, possibly miracles, a sense of meaning and community, a system
<br>
of laws and customs to regulate society. I think the real trumping meme
<br>
is that it is based on a somewhat static worldview; Christianity has the
<br>
idea that the End Times is coming Real Soon Now, and that causes a lot
<br>
of millennialist angst and trouble. Islam takes a more timeless
<br>
approach, and while the End will happen eventually it is not imminent so
<br>
you can get along with your life. The timelessness is also appealing to
<br>
many people - hard for *us* neophiles to relate to, but true.
<br>
<p>And there is the ISO 9001 side: Islamic expansion set up a natural
<br>
system of trade and pilgrimage routes, defined standards of business
<br>
(there is even a part in the Quran saying you shouldn't take too much
<br>
time from business to pray!) and helped develop social networks
<br>
conductive of trade and trust. Just the thing to get a lot of people
<br>
very converted. 
<br>
<p>Sure, forcible conversions occured, but I have a definite impression
<br>
from my history studies that they were a minor part in what happened.
<br>
Why spend energy on bothering the citizens when you can convert/replace
<br>
the ruler? After they change their minds the rest will follow over time. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is being non-violent, pacifistic, etc. is *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a surviving meme.  In a world where some fraction of individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will exploit the terrain, they will extract the resources from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals who allow them to do so, eliminating such individuals.
</em><br>
<p>I think we can learn a lot from the Prisoner's Dilemma here (the game
<br>
may be different, but the general truth remains): always cooperating
<br>
(pacificm) works well in a cooperating (tolerant) environment, but is
<br>
vulnerable to defector strategies (fundamentalists and predators). A
<br>
reciprocal strategy that rewards cooperation and punishes defection can
<br>
promote cooperation even in a very defector-dominated environment. This
<br>
would correspond to a non initiation of force strategy: be nice until
<br>
somebody is not nice back, then make sure that trick will cost them. 
<br>
<p>In societies such strategies can be implemented by labor division, where
<br>
we place the retaliatory part of the strategy in the hands of selected
<br>
or hired members (police, military) and ourselves largely follow a pure
<br>
cooperation strategy. This is really what a civil society is about. 
<br>
<p>The problem today is selecting just the right amount of retaliation and
<br>
who to direct it at. I wonder if a distributed market solution to that
<br>
problem could be applied? Not just idea futures, but violence futures?
