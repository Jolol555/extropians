<em>&gt; &gt;Shawn asks whether National ID Cards, driver's licenses, etc. violate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rights.  When investigating corruption, we are told to follow the money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;When investigating, or evaluating, a proposed government measure, we must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;follow the force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;A compulsory national ID card would _require_ that a citizen (1) go to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;office and take all the necessary administrative steps to have the card
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;issued, and (2) carry the card about their person at all times. They would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be required to do this of course because there would be a threat of force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hanging over them if they did not comply. When a government demands an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;explicit, positive action from citizens, and provides for coercive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;punishment for those who are uncooperative, that government is initiating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;force. There is no other force present, or crime committed, in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;scenario - only the government's. This applies equally to driver's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;licenses, a license to do business, or a concealed carry permit. The &gt; &gt;government has no right to _permit_ anything, for all is permitted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a free society, all peaceful activity at least. In issuing a national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ID card, the government is basically issuing a permit to live - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;specifically, to live and conduct one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;daily business with slightly less harassment than those who do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have such a card.  But it is the government, not a human being,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that should require a permit.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but this is a bit incomplete. I refer you to Article 1V of the US
<br>
Constitution, primarily Sections 1 and 2 which deal with the 'Full faith
<br>
and credit' and 'privileges and immunities' clauses. These are the
<br>
lynchpins of the bank of trust that the citizenship has in their fellow
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p>There is no basis for a government requiring that a person get a permit
<br>
in order to exercise their natural human rights, as those rights exist
<br>
irrespective of the existence of that government. However, under the
<br>
'full faith and credit' clause, Congress is empowered to regulate how
<br>
the federal and state governments are to determine who is and is not a
<br>
citizen residing in the several states.
<br>
<p>While being a citizen or not is irrelevant to an individuals basic human
<br>
rights, it is highly relevant to whether one can exercise the privileges
<br>
and immunities of being a citizen. A citizen, for example, is immune to
<br>
deportation, while a non-citizen is not. Being able to operate dangerous
<br>
equipment, like a motorized automobile, an aircraft, or a steamship, is
<br>
a privilege that citizens must pass a threshold of qualifications to
<br>
hold. Being able to carry a concealed weapon is considered in many
<br>
states to be a privilege that only citizens can have (while otherse
<br>
consider it a right that only citizens have).
<br>
<p>The difficulty is delineating between rights and privileges. Just
<br>
because we live in a free society does not mean that every action is a
<br>
right. Essentially you could lay the boundary at the line between
<br>
swinging one's fist and hitting another's nose. Being able to smack
<br>
someone else in the snoot is a privilege that you can obtain only with
<br>
the permission of the snoot-holder. It isn't your right. Being able to
<br>
pollute is a privilege you can obtain via the permission and payment of
<br>
fees to the elected/appointed representatives of the rest of the people
<br>
who's surroundings you pollute. It isn't your right.
<br>
<p>Similarly, placing increased risk of injury and/or death on others by
<br>
operating dangerous equipment demands permission to exercise a privilege
<br>
(the sole exception being that equipment covered under the 2nd
<br>
Amendment).
<br>
<p>Finally, Article IV only covers the rights, privileges, and immunities
<br>
of citizens of states of the Union. It recognises no rights of
<br>
non-citizens, therefore it is the Congress' job to impose some means of
<br>
allowing the reliable determination of which group an individual belongs
<br>
to, so as to allow the individual to be treated in the proper legal
<br>
manner as befits their status as a citizen or non-citizen.
<br>
<p>Refusing to do this will result in all of us being treated like
<br>
non-citizens, and our society of trust is destroyed.
