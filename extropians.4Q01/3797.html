</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sure about that.  I think that in the past ten years, the genre 
<br>
of &quot;Electronica&quot; has branched out from being essentially one style of 
<br>
music, to being literally hundreds of variations on a style such as we have 
<br>
today (Ambient, Drum N' Bass, Progressive Electronica, House, Jungle, Goa, 
<br>
Techno etc.).  I would argue that this is a direct by-product of having 
<br>
more tools available to express one's creative leanings.  Newer 
<br>
technologies in music (as in all fields) lead to more options, and 
<br>
ultimately more creativity.  Some good examples of this are with artists 
<br>
who have essentially adapted to the times.  For some reason, Jeff Beck 
<br>
seems to stand out in the forefront of my mind: back in the sixties, he 
<br>
pioneered the use of feedback and distortion before Hendrix came on the 
<br>
scene.  Through the seventies and eighties, his music reflected the latest 
<br>
in processing and guitar-synthesis.  Then finally, in the late nineties and 
<br>
at the beginning of this year, he released two albums that heavily 
<br>
incorporate electronica and other &quot;new&quot; genres while still retaining his 
<br>
familiar style.  And Jeff Beck is just the first one who comes to 
<br>
mind...you can say similar things about a multitude of artists whose music 
<br>
has become notably different as a direct result of new technologies being 
<br>
made available.
<br>
<p>As for the original question of where music will go next, that is a very 
<br>
tough question to ponder.  Judging by the general trend of the last four 
<br>
decades, I think it could become a bit more mellow than what we have been 
<br>
hearing for the last five years.  In my opinion, the biggest area that 
<br>
musical technology has and will continue to affect is in the production 
<br>
end, as opposed to the writing and performance end.  Being able to 
<br>
digitally smooth out and process any aspect of an analog-initiated 
<br>
performance is a very valuable tool nowadays.  Just try to find any decent 
<br>
producer or engineer who hasn't used Pro Tools yet.  I don't foresee analog 
<br>
guitars and basses being phased out anytime soon, but the analog drum kit 
<br>
will soon be a goner, I fear.  Most musicians (at least, the ones who are 
<br>
not drummers...) only want a steady beat to play to.  The labor of finding 
<br>
a drummer (let alone a good one) and hauling around the multitude of 
<br>
equipment the average drummer has is rather redundant, when you can get 
<br>
digital equipment that is almost always the equal of an analog (i.e. flesh 
<br>
and blood) drummer.  That isn't to say I don't think there is room for live 
<br>
drummers --quite the opposite...I play drums, myself-- but their numbers 
<br>
will steadily decrease in most genres.
<br>
<p>Not to be overly obvious, but I also think that the digification of analog 
<br>
instruments will increase steadily for the next number of years.  Look to 
<br>
see more and more of those old Mellotrons, Hammond and Farfisa organs, 
<br>
Moogs, Prophets, Jupiters and VCS3s become MIDIfied and used in more 
<br>
commercial recordings.
<br>
<p>As for me, I'm just happy with my Korgs!
