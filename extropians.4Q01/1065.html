<p>I suspect this isn't *always* true.  In my case the card was never
<br>
stolen.  If merchants are presented with what appears to be a
<br>
perfectly valid card and it matches what appears to be a perfectly
<br>
valid ID how can they be held responsible?  (We know that some of
<br>
the terrorists got into the country on stolen, presumably doctored
<br>
passports).  As I recall thefts of CC blanks in the past is what
<br>
lead to the current system of holograms on the cards and having to
<br>
confirm your receipt of the card with a separately sent security
<br>
code before it becomes usable.
<br>
<p>In the situation I mentioned, I believe that the information thieves
<br>
created dummy cards that worked at cash machines or some more sophisticated
<br>
method of tapping into the fund transfer authorization system was developed.
<br>
I don't think the CC companies can hold the banks responsible for a
<br>
release of cash that they authorized.  There was a lot of discussion
<br>
regarding how the Russian fund transfer system was developed by the
<br>
Russian's because they didn't want to pay for the use of the Western system.
<br>
They apparently used a weaker encryption system than they should have
<br>
(perhaps a mole on the development team???) and that may have contributed
<br>
to the security failure.  Another theory was moles inside the centers
<br>
that recieve the CC information and issue the approval codes.
<br>
<p>I've never followed up on it to determine if they ever figured out
<br>
how the system failed.  The CC companies probably kept it under
<br>
wraps just as Citibank did when the Russians hacked into their system.
