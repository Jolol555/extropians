Anders' post deserves a more thoughtful reply than I can frame just at the moment.
<br>
However, I want to acknowledge that 
<br>
1) he's on target, and 
<br>
2) I don't know what to do about it.
<br>
All posts are not created equal.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Taken as read.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there a problem here? I think so. The social interaction part is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important, without it extropians would just be an ordinary SIG. But when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the actual extropian content becomes so small (the core posts were just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7.7%) the list becomes just an ordinary forum in any case. That means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that developing new extropian ideas and concepts is not best done here.
</em><br>
<p>I am assuming this is raw post count, not based on word count or something.
<br>
<p>Agreed. This is part of the neverending &quot;Is 'extropians' a watering hole, a 
<br>
recruiting office, or a SIG?&quot; question. 'extropians' is my watering hole; 
<br>
I have no other; I try to add value any way I can. Humor, etc. has led to 
<br>
my finding perhaps a dozen people _really_ worth knowing. Usually, I'm posting 
<br>
for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure, there is a fairly positive audience here, but the total brainpower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is directed at everyday issues rather than extropian issues, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real extropian discussion never gets off the ground. It is a bit like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the critical mass problem with mailing lists: a too small list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of how good it is, will not sustain itself. Here we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small extropians list embedded in a big noisy forum.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I personally hate the eternal list quality discussion - it has recurred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the Golden Days and will likely continue until the omega point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I think this is more serious than just people flaming each other or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying stupid things: it is about a lack of focus that is undermining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the development of transhumanist ideas at a cruicial point in time.
</em><br>
<p>Time to create the exi-hardcore list. Sorry, but if that's what you want,
<br>
that's the way to get it. And the condition is necessary but not sufficient,
<br>
for all the obvious reasons. Idea: _pay_ people for quality posts. Don't
<br>
penalize people for doing &quot;lateral&quot; things, or even for fiddling while the 
<br>
WTC burns. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I find it worrying that many of the most extropian posts were re-posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from elsewhere. Jaron Lanier's post today would definitely have made it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into my &quot;really extropian&quot; category, and he is one of our main critics!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we don't produce any good ideas ourselves, others will do it instead.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Worrying?&quot; Hmm.
<br>
<p>I was the guy who forwarded that. If I don't (re)post things that matter,
<br>
I'm not doing my job as a list member. If I don't have time or attention,
<br>
at least I bring it to the attention to people who might. I'm still 
<br>
thinking about it, I'm just not saying anything. Conduits still add value.
<br>
<p>I will try to make myself more useful here. &quot;Roger, Wilco!&quot;
