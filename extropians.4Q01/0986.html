<em>&gt; You know the &quot;crop duster&quot; idea?  It turns out that was developed

<em>&gt; Anthrax spores and published in an Office of Technology Assessment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; report in 1994.  [Stupid, stupid, stupid...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A good source is a collection of articles from the CDC:

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no4/contents.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no4/contents.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Particularly the Tucker, Davis and Olson articles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, I'd like to particularly suggest that you read them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lets assume the Iraqi's still have 1/10th of the 84,250 liters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of anthrax spores they were supposed to have produced.  Lets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that 100 kg (@ 1kg/l) can kill the low end of the 130,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 3 million people estimated in the OTA assement.  That quantity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of spores would kill more than 10 million people if they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find a way to deliver it effectively.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Supposed to have produced&quot; is the operative phrase.  The other
<br>
operative phrase is &quot;if they could .. deliver it&quot;.  If they have
<br>
it, they can't deliver it and if they did they know their
<br>
country would be a radioactive dustbowl soon thereafter.  So
<br>
where exactly is the huge worry comming out of Iraq?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein has already demonstrated a willingness to use such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons.  The only thing stopping him is the knowledge that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we wouldn't hesitate to erase him from the planet if he did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How has he demonstrated this?  You refer perhaps to his use of
<br>
gas
<br>
against Iranians in the war?  The war that we encouraged him
<br>
in?  Yes, he also used some of those same weapons we gave him in
<br>
ways we weren't so happy with.  Espcially when many of the gas
<br>
shells had US markings on them.  
<br>
<p>But if, and it is a big IF, he is desperate enough to use these
<br>
supposed weapons now, then what part did we ourselves play in
<br>
making him that desperate?  We created this guy and largely
<br>
supplied him. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Heed these words:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Too many times in the past we have failed to anticipate future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; developments; refused to think the unthinkable and expect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unexpected. Too many times we have been out maneuvered by those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take the time to think and plan and do not simply rely on reacting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to events. We must learn to think like our potential adversaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if we are to avoid conflict or blunt an attack, because only superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking and planning (not just better technology) will enable us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; survive biological warfare.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is true.  But the best way to avoid dying in a war is not
<br>
to get into one.  The second best way is not to prolong one
<br>
unnecessarily or push more and more people into the enemy camp
<br>
and increasingly inflame them.
