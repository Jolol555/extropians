<p>
There were a couple of good articles in the L.A. Times Opinion
<br>
section yesterday which I didn't get around to reading until today.
<br>
<p>One was by Bart Kosko, a fuzzy theorist at USC who is familiar to many
<br>
of us.  In &quot;Your Privacy is a Disappearing Act&quot;,
<br>
<a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-000095718dec02.story">http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-000095718dec02.story</a>,
<br>
he lists the various new measures which the government is using to
<br>
track people and shows how ineffective they are likely to be against
<br>
dedicated terrorists.  I was a little concerned though that he talked
<br>
about anonymous remailers and cryptography as tools for terrorists which
<br>
would thwart the government's efforts; this might just lead to a crackdown
<br>
on privacy technologies.
<br>
<p>The other was on cloning, &quot;A Tempest in a Petri Dish&quot;, by Gregory
<br>
Stock of UCLA, who has been to some of the Extro conferences.  He has a
<br>
refreshingly different perspective on the positive potential of human
<br>
cloning.  After reading the NY Times article that was referenced here
<br>
yesterday about biologists being afraid to come out in public with their
<br>
pro-cloning opinions, it is good to see Stock courageously making a case
<br>
which is not heard very much these days.
<br>
<p>BTW the article mentions that Stock has a book coming out in March 2002,
<br>
&quot;Redesigning Humans: Our Inevitable Genetic Future&quot;.  Sounds like that
<br>
should get some publicity for our views, no doubt igniting controversy
<br>
and discussion which can only be good for society.
<br>
<p>It was great to see two articles with Extropian perspectives on the
<br>
same day.
