Scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
<br>
have announced what is effectively a hand-held neutron
<br>
source.  Article here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://physicsweb.org/article/news/5/11/14">http://physicsweb.org/article/news/5/11/14</a>
<br>
<p>Mr. Jones is shouting from the back of the room &quot;I feel like
<br>
you are an imbecile because a new neutron source has *NOTHING*
<br>
to do with Eliezer's sleeping habits.&quot;  Master Bradbury
<br>
turns to Mr. Jones, with just a hint of a twinkle in his eye,
<br>
attempting to adopt a serious look, though one can see a suggestion
<br>
of a raised Spock-like eyebrow, and says, &quot;But new neutron
<br>
sources have *everything* to do with how Eliezer sleeps.&quot;
<br>
Mr. Jones, being a model extropian says, &quot;Please explain
<br>
to me why that is the case.&quot;
<br>
<p>Master Bradbury says, &quot;Well we *know* that mature nanotechnology
<br>
is very sensitive to radiation right?&quot;  Mr. Jones says &quot;yes&quot;.
<br>
Master Bradbury says, &quot;And we know that Eliezer is not particularly
<br>
fond of the hazards presented by mature nanotechnology, right?&quot;
<br>
Mr. Jones again says &quot;yes&quot;.  &quot;Well then&quot;, Master Bradbury points
<br>
out, &quot;with handheld neutron sources, Eliezer can perform nanotech
<br>
sterilizations of anything he comes into contact with.  Previous
<br>
sterilization methods were problematic.  Proton or electron beams
<br>
can be dealt with via clever electromagnetic shields.  Gamma rays
<br>
do much less damage to an atomically precise structure (depending
<br>
on the interaction profiles of the element types in the nanomachinery
<br>
with gamma rays of various energies).  But 'neutrons' -- they are
<br>
the gold standard -- they can't be blocked (except by massive amounts
<br>
of shielding) and when absorbed by the elements in the nanomachinery
<br>
they ultimately cause transmutation which changes the element
<br>
bonding properties which of course breaks the nanomachinery.  Since
<br>
Eliezer now has a robust defense against nanomachinery, he can now
<br>
sleep more comfortably at night.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, it is left as an exercise for the reader whether Eliezer
<br>
will choose to live in a neutron beam studded enclave where
<br>
he is his natural self and no nanomachinery can ever reach him
<br>
*or* whether he will continuously irradiate himself with
<br>
neutron beams relying on his own certified nanobots to sort
<br>
out the radioactive atoms that will result (returning them
<br>
to the nearest radioisotope-to-stable isotope transmutation
<br>
facility as properly extropic people should).
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p>Though I've mentioned it only briefly in previous posts, scientists
<br>
at Los Alamos have proposed methods for transmuting radioactive
<br>
isotopes back into stable isotopes.  What has been lacking is
<br>
an effecient inexpensive separation technology (for the radioactive
<br>
vs. non-radioactive atoms).  Mature nanotechnology provides such
<br>
separation capabilities.
