If you thought HAL-9000 was bad, what about Mao Zedong, Stalin, Napoleon, and
<br>
others. Shouldn't extropians be concerned about human intelligence as well as
<br>
artificial intelligence?
<br>
<p>Fighting Mad Leader Disease
<br>
<a href="http://americanscientist.org/Issues/Sciobs01/sciobs0111madleader.html">http://americanscientist.org/Issues/Sciobs01/sciobs0111madleader.html</a>
<br>
A potentially devastating condition that has affected hundreds of thousands of
<br>
people, and even altered the course of world history, remains unchecked,
<br>
President James F. Toole warned in his opening remarks to the World Congress
<br>
of Neurology in London last June. He urged members of the international
<br>
community of neurologists to take action.
<br>
<p>The threat? A condition he called &quot;mad leader disease.&quot; Mental competence in
<br>
world leaders is often taken for granted, said Toole, a stroke expert and
<br>
director of the Cerebrovascular Research Center at Wake Forest University. But
<br>
he doesn't think it should be. The world community must work to develop
<br>
methods for the identification and treatment of mental illness in world
<br>
leaders, he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Never forget that war begins in the minds of men,&quot; he told the audience.
<br>
Leaders are granted unparalleled powers over resources, including weapons of
<br>
mass destruction, and their influence on public citizens cannot be
<br>
overestimated, he said.
<br>
<p>Throughout history, leaders have been afflicted with a variety of mental and
<br>
behavioral disorders. In the 18th century, King George III of England suffered
<br>
bouts of insanity, impairing his decision-making abilities and losing him
<br>
valuable colonies, including those that would become the United States.
<br>
<p>More recently, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson sustained a stroke in October of
<br>
1919, which left him incapacitated during several crucial months as the Treaty
<br>
of Versailles awaited ratification in the Senate. Chairman Mao Zedong of the
<br>
People's Republic of China was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in
<br>
1972; few were aware of the extent of his physical deterioration, and he
<br>
remained in a position of power until his death in 1976. The degree to which
<br>
leaders' deficits have been concealed from the public is a topic of great
<br>
concern, Toole said in an interview.
<br>
<p>People are entitled to the privacy of their medical records, but leaders &quot;hold
<br>
too much power to be given the right to hide disabilities from their publics,&quot;
<br>
agrees Robert Dallek, a presidential historian and professor of history at
<br>
Boston University.
<br>
<p>In the United States, the 25th amendment to the Constitution, ratified in
<br>
February of 1967, provides for a transfer of power to the vice president
<br>
should the president become incapacitated. However, as Toole pointed out in an
<br>
article published in 1994 in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
<br>
the disability amendment has been invoked only once: One morning in July of
<br>
1985 Ronald Reagan underwent surgery to remove a malignant tumor and signed a
<br>
letter turning power over to the vice president. Later that day, following the
<br>
surgery and while he was still medicated, Reagan's advisers allowed him to
<br>
sign a second letter reclaiming presidential power.
<br>
<p>Mental incapacitation or deterioration is difficult to define because &quot;there
<br>
is little agreement even among experts about the line separating normality
<br>
from insanity,&quot; says Kendrick Clements, a biographer of Wilson and history
<br>
professor at the University of South Carolina.
<br>
<p>To better inform decisions regarding mental competence, Toole proposes adding
<br>
mental examinations to the annual physical exam required of American
<br>
presidents. Although mental illness can occur at any age, incidence of
<br>
cognitive impairment increases with age. Therefore, at 60 years and older,
<br>
world leaders should submit to an annual magnetic-resonance imaging scan and
<br>
mini-mental status exam, said Toole, who is 76 and recently co-edited a book,
<br>
Presidential Disability, issued by the Working Group on Presidential
<br>
Disability.
<br>
<p>The international community's response to an unsatisfactory exam will require
<br>
careful consideration of both political and medical consequences. And although
<br>
he admits it will be difficult to gain compliance from certain countries,
<br>
Toole hopes that encouraging discussion at an international and nonpolitical
<br>
level, among meetings such as the World Congress of Neurology, will
<br>
precipitate change and allow the threat of mad leader disease to be subdued
<br>
with a minimum of casualties.-Rebecca Sloan Slotnick

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
