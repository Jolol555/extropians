What is intelligence? This may seem to be more of a question
<br>
for psychologists than physicists. But two researchers (Joseph
<br>
Wakeling, <a href="mailto:jwakeling@webdrake.net?Subject=Re:%20Scientists%20locate%20intelligence%20...%20in%20BODY&In-Reply-To=&lt;0b7601c1647c$cfd2b720$0c5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">jwakeling@webdrake.net</a>, now at the University of
<br>
Fribourg, Switzerland, and Per Bak, Imperial College, 011-44-20-
<br>
7594-8528, <a href="mailto:p.bak@ic.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20Scientists%20locate%20intelligence%20...%20in%20BODY&In-Reply-To=&lt;0b7601c1647c$cfd2b720$0c5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">p.bak@ic.ac.uk</a>) argue that intelligence is not an abstract
<br>
concept, but must be considered as a physical phenomenon. Any
<br>
definition of intelligence, they say, cannot ignore a living being's
<br>
environment, INCLUDING ITS VERY OWN BODY. In their view, an organism
<br>
is only intelligent relative to how well it solves the problems that its
<br>
surroundings throw at it. This runs counter to many historical ideas,
<br>
including the concept that the mind is separate from the BODY, or that it
<br>
is possible to build a desktop computer that thinks like a human
<br>
without having the same physical environment or BODY. To explore the
<br>
idea of intelligence, the researchers ran computer simulations of
<br>
artificial neural networks called &quot;minibrains.&quot; In the simulations, 251
<br>
minibrains each attempted to pick the less popular of two choices, 0
<br>
and 1, analogous to 251 motorists all trying to pick the less congested
<br>
road.  This &quot;Minority Game&quot; would be repeated over many successive
<br>
rounds. Each minibrain consisted of three layers of &quot;neurons&quot;: &quot;input
<br>
neurons,&quot; which dictated how many past rounds it could remember,
<br>
leading to an intermediary layer, which then led into an &quot;output&quot; layer
<br>
that determined what choice was made. If the minibrain ending up
<br>
making an incorrect choice, it would reduce the strength of the
<br>
connections between neurons supplying the &quot;wrong answer.&quot; The
<br>
researchers were in for a surprise when they endowed all of the
<br>
minibrains with equal abilities, which would be analogous to a bunch
<br>
of motorists with the same amount of decision-making skill. In this
<br>
situation, no minibrains correctly guessed the minority choice with
<br>
even a 50 percent success rate, which is what you'd get by making the
<br>
choice with a random flip of a coin. Even an E. coli bacterium, which
<br>
searches for glucose by moving in random directions in its
<br>
environment, is seemingly more intelligent than this. Only when the
<br>
researchers introduced a &quot;rogue&quot; minibrain with more intermediate
<br>
neurons to analyze the past rounds did it attain more than a 50 percent
<br>
success rate.  Their simulations suggest that intelligence often hinges
<br>
on how much one can make use of the data in its physical
<br>
environment. (Wakeling and Bak, Physical Review E, November
<br>
2001)
