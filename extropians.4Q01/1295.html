Mike,
<br>
<p>You should do a bit of looking before you assume you know the
<br>
story and I am &quot;talking out [my] ear&quot;.
<br>
<p>from Encylopedia.com
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahhabi
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahhabi
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pronounced As: wähäb , reform movement in Islam,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;originating in Arabia. It was founded by Muhammad ibn Abd
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;al-Wahab (c.1703-1791), who taught that all accretions to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Islam after the 3d cent. of the Muslim era-i.e., after
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.950-were spurious and must be expunged. This view,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involving essentially a purification of the Sunni sect,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regarded the veneration of saints, ostentation in worship,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and luxurious living as the chief evils. Accordingly,
<br>
Wahhabi
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mosques are simple and without minarets, and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adherents dress plainly and do not smoke tobacco or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hashish. Driven from Medina for his preaching, the founder
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Wahhabi sect went into the NE Nejd and converted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Saud tribe. The Saudi sheik, convinced that it was his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;religious mission to wage holy war (jihad) against all
<br>
other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forms of Islam, began the conquest of his neighbors in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.1763. By 1811 the Wahhabis ruled all Arabia, except
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yemen, from their capital at Riyadh. The Ottoman sultan,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nominally suzerain over Arabia, had vainly sent out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expeditions to crush them. Only when the sultan called on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muhammad Ali of Egypt for aid did he meet success; by 1818
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Wahhabis were driven into the desert. In the Nejd they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collected their power again and from 1821 to 1833 gained
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control over the Persian Gulf coast of Arabia. The domain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereafter steadily weakened; Riyadh was lost in 1884, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in 1889 the Saud family fled for refuge into the
<br>
neighboring
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state of Kuwait. The Wahhabi movement was to enjoy its
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third triumph when Ibn Saud advanced from his capture of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riyadh in 1902 to the reconstitution in 1932 of nearly all
<br>
his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ancestral domain under the name Saudi Arabia, where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wahhabism remains dominant. Wahhabism served as an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inspiration to other Islamic reform movements from India
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sumatra to North Africa and the Sudan.

<em>&gt; One again, Samantha talking out her ear. Wahhabism does support war and

</em><br>
