<p>Perhaps you are thinking of the use of dendritic cells(DC) for tumor
<br>
immunotherapy?
<br>
<p>Seems that there are a variety of approaches or implementations of the
<br>
theory, in vitro or in vivo. For example, withdraw a blood
<br>
specimen from the patient and isolate the dendritic cells. Culture these
<br>
cells with enhanced or unenhanced tumor cells from the patient. Inject by IV
<br>
these modified autologous dendritic cells back into the patient. The
<br>
souped-up dendritic cells (bearing the tumor specific antigens) then
<br>
approach the T cells where the immune response is activated against the
<br>
tumor.
<br>
<p>Issues of relevance span autoimmunity activation, the downside of using
<br>
GSF(growth stimulating factor), contamination via exogenous treatment,
<br>
enhancing potent antigenicity, and adenoviral vectors.

...Genzyme Molecular Oncology has initiated three phase I/II cancer vaccine
<br>
clinical trials using a novel technology developed at the Dana-Farber Cancer
<br>
Institute called dendritic/cancer cell fusion technology.
<br>
This novel technology combines a patient's dendritic cells with their
<br>
inactivated tumor cells in a laboratory procedure. The fused cells are
<br>
injected back into the patient to stimulate an immune response against the
<br>
patient's cancer.
<br>
The cell fusion process eliminates the need to identify specific antigens to
<br>
use in a vaccine by automatically incorporating the entire menu of antigens
<br>
found on the patient's original tumor cells.

Most tumor-associated antigens represent self-proteins and as a result are
<br>
poorly immunogenic due to immune tolerance. Here we show that tolerance to
<br>
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is overexpressed by the majority of
<br>
lethal malignancies, can be reversed by immunization with a CEA-derived
<br>
peptide. This peptide was altered to make it a more potent T cell antigen
<br>
and loaded onto dendritic cells (DCs) for delivery as a cellular vaccine.
<br>
Although DCs are rare in the blood...

Last Updated: 2001-02-23 18:30:06 EST (Reuters Health) - A new methodology
<br>
for constructing dendritic cell vaccines may offer a novel approach to
<br>
cancer immunotherapy, according to a report in the February 15th issue of
<br>
International Journal of Cancer

Dendritic cell function is critically dependent on their location and state
<br>
of maturation. Immature DC reside in all peripheral tissues (areas of high
<br>
antigen encounter) and are equipped to capture and process antigen. ...In
<br>
response to activation signals, ...these immature DC undergo maturation.
<br>
During maturation the DC down-regulate their ability to process antigen and
<br>
up-regulate ...as well as costimulatory and adhesion molecules developing
<br>
into potent T cell stimulators. At the same time these DC migrate into the
<br>
lymph node. In the secondary lymphoid organs, DC express high levels of
<br>
chemokines which preferentially attract naive (CD45RA+) T cells. ...
<br>
====================================================
<br>
<p>Personally, I like the actinium nanogenerator described in the 16 November
<br>
issue of Science:
<br>
<p>[By bringing the nanogenerator's firepower directly inside the cancer cells,
<br>
the researchers were able to realize other benefits as well. The trail
<br>
blazed by an alpha particle is two to three cell diameters wide, so any hit
<br>
from inside or outside the cancer cell will kill it. The likelihood of a
<br>
direct hit improves, however, once the nanogenerator is inside the cell.
<br>
&quot;The odds of an alpha particle hitting a cell are 100 percent if the
<br>
particle generator is inside the cell, but only 30 percent if the
<br>
nanogenerator binds to the cell's outer surface,&quot; says Scheinberg.]
<br>
<p>Gotta go, now. Stake out my spot at the Leonid Drive-In.
