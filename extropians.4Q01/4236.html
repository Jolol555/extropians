<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think there's anyone here who will rationally argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the contention that if I underwent a non-destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; atom-by-atom copy process, two 100-kg lumps of matter would wake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; up with the memeories I presently call &quot;mine&quot;, as well as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sensations, perceptions, values, desires, and intentions I call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mine.  It doesn't matter to me which one I call &quot;me&quot;, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; matters is what actual consequences will this action have on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the world, are they likely to happen in the future, and which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of them are good and bad?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given that it doesn't matter to you which one of a set of similar Lees is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, why do you care of any of them is? Do you in fact care if any of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;you&quot;? With respect to what do you judge the consequences of the action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you describe above? Why?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I parse those sentences well, but I'll try to answer: what I
<br>
(that is, the present 100-kg lump of matter I call &quot;me&quot;) care about is
<br>
physical consequences.  Will my present manifestation suffer pain or loss?
<br>
Will the copy compete with me for resources, friends, romantic interests?
<br>
Will society recognize my past accomplishments in both copies when we go
<br>
to look for work?  Will society ostracize us for having done this?  Do I
<br>
have to right to create that other 100-kg (Oh, all right, 104 :-) lump
<br>
of matter, knowing that it, too, will suffer the consequences of my
<br>
action, or is it morally equivalent to repropducing by other means?
<br>
<p>Many of those consequences don't apply to the destructive-copy case, so
<br>
I don't fear that as much, because I believe the actual physical
<br>
experience of that will be little different from experiences I've
<br>
already had and am familiar with (sleep, movement, etc.).  I certainly
<br>
understand why some people might fear that process because it resembles
<br>
the kind of &quot;death&quot; we currently fear (because it is currently
<br>
permanent).  I can't say whether I, too, would have that fear if the
<br>
situation ever became real, but I'd like to think I could overcome my
<br>
evolutionarily programmed fear of death with my rational knowledge
<br>
that it is no longer the same thing my ancestors went through.
