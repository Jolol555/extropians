Rather than comment on &quot;opinions&quot;, I would like to STRESS
<br>
a need for the most stringent adherence to the &quot;facts&quot;
<br>
to the degree that we can determine them.

</em><br>
<p>Spike, I tend to agree with Samantha here.  I don't believe
<br>
that the Islamic faith calls for the killing of infidels.
<br>
However, making a point against Samantha, I did see a PBS
<br>
special on the history of Islam that *did* suggest that in
<br>
Islamic regions it was perfectly accepted to impose a special
<br>
&quot;tax&quot; on non-Islamic individuals.
<br>
<p>Samantha's humanistic position is fine in principle (as
<br>
we extropians can sit in our lofty towers and preach how
<br>
we would like it to be) but it ignores the problem of the
<br>
aggrievances of history.

<p><em>&gt;From &quot;Bottom Line Personal&quot;, 22(22) Nov. 15 2001, commentary
</em><br>
by Benjamin Weiner, U.S. diplomat for 10 years who has lived
<br>
and worked in a number of Muslim countries (so better qualified
<br>
to comment on &quot;reality&quot; than perhaps anyone on this list):
<br>
<p>====================================================================
<br>
&quot;What triggered the terrorist threat we face today?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventional wisdom says the terrorist threat is of recent origin,
<br>
a reaction to the Persian Gulf War, the creation of Israel and the
<br>
continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reality?  Today's terrorism also relfects an accumulation of
<br>
humiliation and anger that has been building throughout the Islamic
<br>
world for 1,000 years.  This rage is deep-seated and widely felt. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Background: After the death of Islam's founder, the prophet Muhammad,
<br>
in the seventh century, Arab-speaking Muslim traders and warriors swept
<br>
through Asia, North Africa and parts of Europe.  Then a series of events
<br>
began to erode this Islamic dominance and eventually led to the demise of
<br>
the once-powerful Muslim Ottoman Empire.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What sorts of events and who launched them?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Start with the Crusades.  To Europeans, they were a glorious attempt
<br>
to return the holy city of Jerusalem to Christian rule.  In Islamic eyes,
<br>
they represented a bloody, prolonged invasion of the Muslim world by the
<br>
Christian West.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslims ruled parts of Spain for several hundred years, until they
<br>
were driven out in the late 15th century.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim Ottoman Empire had grown into a great power--that stretched
<br>
far beyond the Middle East.  But the empire collapsed early in the 20th
<br>
century, a victim of corruption, old age and military defeats by the West.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the centuries, Muslims lost influence and land to the Christian
<br>
West.  Their countries were subjected to the rule of Western colonial
<br>
powers, such as France and Great Britian, and then to the neocolonial
<br>
practices of the local governments that took power.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To many Muslims, these local governments embraced Western hedonism and
<br>
corruption.  The result was, again, humiliation and a sense of impotence--
<br>
and a desire on the part of some Muslims to redress this imbalance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What issues are feeding this rage?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;First, keep in mind that Muhammad is venerated by Muslims as the final
<br>
and greatest of all the prophets.  But Muhammed lived in the seventh century.
<br>
While other major religions evolved over the centuries, many of the tenets
<br>
of Islam remain frozen in the past.&quot;  [snip]
<br>
=============================================================================
<br>
<p>I'll comment by simply asking the question of:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why is the Islamic faith now followed by ~1 billion people?&quot;
<br>
Certainly a majority of them were taught by their parents -- but
<br>
the fundamental question becomes *what* fraction of original
<br>
converts, from Jewish/Christian/Pagan religions, were &quot;voluntary&quot;?
<br>
<p>While, I do not place Islam in the box that Spike does (Kill the infidels),
<br>
I cannot ignore the fact that it seems *highly* likely that many conversions
<br>
to Islam were the result of coercion.  This is particularly true if the
<br>
&quot;tax the 'infidels'&quot; policy is accurate.
<br>
<p>Again, going back to the PBS special, it is clear that the rise
<br>
of the Ottoman Empire was based on &quot;warrior princes&quot; where ones
<br>
worth had to be proved by conquest.  Cannons were invented by
<br>
Islamic warriors to conquer Constantinople.  See:
<br>
<a href="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/english/osmanli/osmanli-istanbul.html">http://www.kultur.gov.tr/english/osmanli/osmanli-istanbul.html</a>
<br>
The Islamic &quot;expansion&quot; was halted in Spain and Bulgaria.
<br>
Samantha, while &quot;protecting&quot; Islam, has to acknowledge that
<br>
it is questionable how non-violent its initial expansion once
<br>
was.  Policies of &quot;warrior princes&quot; that use religions to
<br>
&quot;dehumanize&quot; infidel opponents are certainly of value.
<br>
A lack of &quot;rejecting&quot; such policies by religious leaders
<br>
is essentialy abandoning the religion into the service of aims
<br>
that require violent means to an end.
<br>
<p>Now, while some might claim that such expansions were a direct
<br>
response to the Crusades -- it becomes necessary to delve deeper
<br>
into Islamic history to determine precisely *how* the Islamic
<br>
faith spread out of Saudia Arabia in the first place.
<br>
<p>While the Christian &quot;meme set&quot; has a seductive hook (everlasting
<br>
salvation) I am unsure as to what ideas in the Islamic faith have
<br>
a &quot;trumping&quot; meme.  If there are no trumping memes one can only
<br>
conclude that Islam has been spread primarily by violence and/or
<br>
coercion.
<br>
<p>So, IMO, Samantha, Amara, Spike, et al have a number of problems.
<br>
<p>One can be a non-violent, pacifist, humanist, etc. but if one
<br>
does *not* wrestle with the problem of how to &quot;convert&quot; billions
<br>
of individuals with meme sets with 1000-2000 year histories
<br>
which are in fundamental conflict with extropian principles
<br>
(i.e. evidence is required) then a problem presents itself.
<br>
<p>The problem is being non-violent, pacifistic, etc. is *not*
<br>
a surviving meme.  In a world where some fraction of individuals
<br>
will exploit the terrain, they will extract the resources from
<br>
individuals who allow them to do so, eliminating such individuals.
<br>
Christianity or Islam may be &quot;neutral&quot; (highly interpretable) religions.
<br>
If they do not impose *strong* constraints against *all* acts of aggression
<br>
then they are useless from a game-theoretic standpoint -- they do not
<br>
promote increased trust and as a result increased survivability.
<br>
If Samantha and Amara choose to adopt nonviolent solutions
<br>
against individuals who choose violent solutions, their memes
<br>
lose -- simple, end of discussion.  Now, Spike's more subtle
<br>
solution of &quot;meme changing weapons&quot; is perhaps even more
<br>
dangerous -- it is the adoption of non-rational coercive
<br>
approaches to changing &quot;incorrect&quot; meme-sets.  It would be
<br>
an acceptence of the fact that we cannot win the battle
<br>
with reason and must resort to coercion instead.  To me this
<br>
seems somewhat worse than the Islamic coercive method of imposing
<br>
taxes on &quot;infidels&quot;.  At least in that situation I could
<br>
potentially move to a non-Muslim environment.
<br>
<p>I think this is not a simple problem for either extropians
<br>
or humanity in general.  It is the fundamental question of
<br>
&quot;when can I not protect my meme set from your meme set?&quot;
<br>
<p>If your meme-set allows you to kill me to eliminate my meme-set,
<br>
then your meme-set is fundamentally dangerous.  If your meme-set
<br>
says you will never kill my meme-set, even to preserve your
<br>
meme-set, then it is a very noble meme-set but one that can
<br>
easily be taken advantage of, even eliminated.
<br>
<p>This gets into some very subtle issues as to when meme-sets
<br>
may be voluntarily changed.  If an individual asserts that
<br>
their meme-set is correct, can never be modified and is more
<br>
valid than yours, then I would tend to label that person as
<br>
fairly dangerous to my survival.
