<br>
trade practices. If at some point the USA demands reciprocity, and mutuality 
<br>
on trade, then, for better or worse; the Japanese will become discontent. 
<br>
Perhaps it is in the USA's interest to ignore unfair trade practices by the 
<br>
zaibatsu? 
<br>
<p>Spudboy,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the real question is why should we be content with their trade 
<br>
practices?  It is perfectly okay with me if they are content but that imposes 
<br>
no burden for us to agree with them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you will find this find this acceptance of an uneven playing 
<br>
field between us and the Japanese goes back to the cold war and that was over 
<br>
ten years ago.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, personally I have no problem with the Japanese looking out 
<br>
for themselves but I do have a problem with our government not looking out 
<br>
for our side.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example, a couple of years ago we negotiated a new deal with the 
<br>
Vietnamese.  As I understand the deal we got to invest all the money we 
<br>
wanted in their country and they got to sell all the manufactured goods they 
<br>
wanted in our country.  The question is did they open their markets to our 
<br>
manufactured goods?
<br>
