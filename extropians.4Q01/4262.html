<p>Except that, from the point of view of either of the copies, it is clear who

is the original... he/she is. Everyone else in the universe might view them

identically, but surely the two of them will be able to rationally assign

assymetrical values to each copy. That is, each of these two identical

conscious beings possess a unique ability to measure the difference between
<br>
the two.
