<p>
<em>&gt; The range of views among transhumanists on the issue of personal identity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is wide, yet we cluster more tightly than the general population. ...
</em><br>
<p>A reasonable taxonomy, but what about those of us who specifically
<br>
reject that &quot;identity&quot; is meaningful in any of the proposed senses?
<br>
Physical realities matter, sensations matter, rights matter.  Identities
<br>
don't.  If I were duplicated, the questions that would matter to me
<br>
are: will one of the resulting conscious beings suffer pain?  Will one
<br>
of them unexpectedly wake up poor and with no rights, or should I sign
<br>
a contract with my future duplicate fully consenting to the fact that
<br>
the two conscious beings created wil wake up thinking that their net
<br>
worth has been halved and their exclusive rights apportioned as agreed?
<br>
Do I have the right to impose this burden upon those with whom I share
<br>
personal relationships (for example, do I have a right to create a
<br>
conscious being who will have memories of things I agreed to keep
<br>
secret?)  Will others recognize my education and accomplishments on
<br>
my duplicate's resume when he goes to look for work?
<br>
<p>These are actual questions of fact, and concerns to think about.
<br>
Which of the lumps of flesh is &quot;me&quot; is just mental masturbation.
