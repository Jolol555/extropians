<p>I haven't rented in decades, but maybe Americans can do some sort of
<br>
calibration from this:
<br>
<p>I bought my current house three years ago for $A230K. It's now worth over
<br>
$A300, maybe over $A350K, because this area has boomed. (It pays to be able
<br>
to see into the future.) I have small grassy front and back yards--but
<br>
larger than Spike's--with tall trees. No garage, but you can park out front
<br>
safely (and many of my neighbors do just that, grrrr.) Three bedrooms, one
<br>
a guest room full of books and spare futon, the other with the weights
<br>
machine. Large study full of books and computers, with a big fireplace I
<br>
don't use because of the books and paper piled everywhere. Gas wall
<br>
heaters, because our temperatures rarely drop severely enough to need
<br>
central heating. Polished floorboards, leadlight windows here and there.
<br>
Separate laundry. Galley kitchen (is that the phrase?) open to large living
<br>
space with table, comfy chairs, TV/sound system, big windows everywhere to
<br>
garden. This joint is half an hour by rail from central Melbourne, tram
<br>
equally convenient. Half an hour by bike track to the university. Large
<br>
pretty Lake and creek walking distance away, big supermarkets and
<br>
vegetable/chicken/meat market five minutes away by foot. Library handy.
<br>
Patrick might have paid $A40 for a haircut, but I have much less hair (boo
<br>
hoo), so I pay $A12 every few months.
<br>
<p>What would that cost in the States--in, say, SF, Austin or Boston?
