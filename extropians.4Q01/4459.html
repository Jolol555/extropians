</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well sure, but then they'd no longer be identical because they'd have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different memories of what they read on their GPS machine. You can
</em><br>

<em>&gt; have to happen.
</em><br>
<p>I think we are agreed on all these points.  While they are connected, they
<br>
are one person, when they are disconnected they are two people.
<br>
<p>My only nitpick is that this doesn't seem to help us create identical
<br>
duplicates.  In my mind, they are still connected with information being
<br>
copied from the source to the destination.  In other words, you are still
<br>
allowing the copy operating to keep running.  You will never be done copying
<br>
because the original copy keeps changing.  The moment that you terminate the
<br>
copy operation by cutting the connection, you have two diverging
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; If you stopped feeding them optic signals from the other,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; reality instead of VR.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not using VR, it's just that the room looks symmetrical, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; north the other looking south but the view is the same.
</em><br>
<p>What do you call it when you record all sensory input from the source and
<br>
impose them onto the copy such that it cannot perceive anything but what you
<br>
are broadcasting to it?  That is VR.  You are using this to keep them in
<br>
synch.  I claim that one is perceiving direct input from reality while the
<br>
other is being fed your controlled images.  Although I agree that the two
<br>
are identical in most ways, I would prefer to be the former rather than the
<br>
latter.
