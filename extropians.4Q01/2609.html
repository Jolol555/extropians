<p>### The main reason I have for adopting this position is that minds who do
<br>
not abhor destruction of innocent minds are a murder waiting to happen - in
<br>
contrast to those who have strong inner prohibitions against killing, such
<br>
minds will not hesitate to kill whenever the situation is right, there is
<br>
something to be gained from murder and the police (or other external
<br>
controlling agencies) are busy elsewhere.

<p> It seems somewhat inconsistent: you respect the
life-wish of everyone - regardless of their mental states - except a
certain subset defined by their ethics.
<p>### Certain mental states put you beyond the pale - I do regard mental
states as the basic characteristic worthy or unworthy of respect. The
elements of the mental state referred to as ethics are the most important
ones. 
<p>----
 But that is a limited respect of
the life-wish (after all, even those ignoring it in others have it
themselves),
<p>### Don't forget your respect for the lives of others is also limited - you
feel justified in killing a person trying to slash your throat. If you had
an unlimited respect for life-wish, you would not be able to rationally
decide whether the attacker's life is more or less important than yours. The
limits that I choose to observe are, in my opinion, the most compatible with
my long-term survival, because if implemented, they would limit aggression
against non-aggressors, probably even better than the more pacifistic
position you espouse.
<p>-----
<p> if it was extended further you would yourself fall into the
category of people whose life-wish should not be respected. In fact, it
is not obvious that you are already in that category.
<p>#### Since I would under no circumstances willingly kill an innocent person,
I am by definition innocent myself, and my life-wish should be respected. 
<p>-----
 Would you respect
the life-wish of someone who respected the life-wish of everybody,
except the life-wish of some small ethical subset like (say)
scientologists?
<p>### As I said before, the rule I recognize is &quot;Innocent life-wish must not
be thwarted&quot; - no less, no more. This rule should not be subject to
&quot;conceptual creep&quot;, the slow deformation to fit another agenda. If I define
&quot;innocent = respecting innocent life-wish&quot;, which is a largely
self-referential definition, I cannot start redefining this concept using
arbitrary external data, like being a scientologist, or else the
construction will unravel. Denying rights to those who would not respect my
rights does not reduce my chances of survival - I cannot expect mercy from
those who by their very nature can have none, and I need not be merciful to
them. On the other hand, denying rights to those who would respect my rights
is likely to diminish my chances - an honest scientologist will not kill me,
except if he thinks I would kill him.
<p>A scientologist is likely to be confused, likely brainwashed or nuts,
possibly evil. The first traits are not a reason to be killed (at most
committed for treatment, if there is a risk that innocent persons might be
inadvertently harmed), the other trait, being evil (evil= willing to
disregard the life-wishes of innocent minds) is covered in the basic Life
Rule. There is no need to distort the basic moral axiom to cover all that is
wrong with scientologists, and it is wrong to harm innocent people, even if
they happen to be environmentalists, or worse.
