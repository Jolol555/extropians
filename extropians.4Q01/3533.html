<em>&gt; that analogy, apt as it is.  Rinse and repeat.
</em><br>
<p>There was an article yesterday in the right-wing magazine National Review
<br>
which explored this same concept,
<br>
<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment112701.shtml">http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment112701.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>Of course the NR columnist opposed the analogy, which she attributed to
<br>
a cloning researcher at a conference last August.  In fact the columnist
<br>
seemed to think that the comment was so self-evidentally absurd that
<br>
she was using it to make fun of cloning research in general.
<br>
<p>The article also had some interesting quotes from the Raelians, who have
<br>
an odd mixture of religion and almost Extropian philosophy.  The cult
<br>
leader Rael is quoted as responding to September 11:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must accelerate the development of human cloning technology because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will make terrorist attacks inefficient in the future. Indeed,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when phase 3 of cloning will be reached (the one which will allow the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;direct cloning of an adult thanks to the Accelerated Growth Process)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will be followed by the uploading or downloading of information into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one's brain that contains personality, memory, and life experiences.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when a tragedy occurs, such as the recent one, cloning
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will bring back to life all of the victims -- directly as adults and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their personality will be downloaded into their brain. For this to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happen however, it will be necessary to have a genetic bank in each
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country which would contain the genetic code (what primitive people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used to call the &quot;soul&quot;) of each individual from their birth, and for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each individual to regularly download on their PC a back-up of their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personality (memory and experience) which could then be transferred
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the new clone. The person who would benefit from this technology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would only, after a tragedy, have the last day missing from their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memory. This technology would also allow the cloning of terrorists,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thus allowing us to try them for their crimes. This way, no suicidal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attack would see its perpetrator escape from justice through death.
<br>
<p>Of course this glosses over the difficulty of the upload/download
<br>
process, which is undoubtedly far greater than cloning.  But the
<br>
general idea of achieving immortality through backups is appealing.
<br>
The notion of thwarting attempts to escape justice via suicide is new
<br>
to me.  What would you do if you restored a suicide bomber from a backup?
<br>
There wouldn't be much point in giving him the death penalty.  So what
<br>
is the idea, would you torture him?  That doesn't seem very enlightened.
<br>
