Pretty much correct.

<p><em>&gt; In that same vein, if your girlfriend (or wife, whatever

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think Mike has addressed the complexity of dealing with this.
<br>
How I would happen to deal with it would depend where I am
<br>
located, how much trust had been built up in the relationship and 
<br>
the type of lifestyle agreed upon (monogamous, polyamorous, etc.)
<br>
that could contribute to whether I would &quot;need to know&quot;.  With
<br>
the right individual I would probably be quite content to father
<br>
the child even if it were not mine.  So my internal reasoning
<br>
is more for the purpose of constraining internal agents (based
<br>
on strong beliefs) rather than wrestling with potential betrayals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Jealousy definitely appears (feels?) to be something that comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about from inclusion/exclusion.
</em><br>
<p>Its a fundamental problem that human's (naturally) fear for their
<br>
survival.  I spent several hours Saturday listening to a tear filled
<br>
converstion with a female friend where the fundamental problem
<br>
ultimately came down to a trust issue involving potential betrayal
<br>
where the root cause was feeling &quot;unsafe&quot;.  I think at least some
<br>
women have a &quot;pre-traumatic stress syndrome&quot; involved with fear
<br>
of betrayal and disertion by their partners.  Not dissimilar to what
<br>
many of us have felt post-911 (worrying about our safety or survival).  
<br>
I suspect the &quot;gut&quot; reaction mentioned by Amara is tied into
<br>
our fundamental fight-or-flight response depending to a large
<br>
degree on the extent to which you have built a mental framework
<br>
where happiness ~= having a partner ~= feeling safe ~= increased ability
<br>
to survive (or increase ones children's chances for survival).
<br>
The minute you have entombed your happiness/survival in another
<br>
individual its a recipe for strong reactions the minute they
<br>
begin to exhibit behaviors that might threaten the status quo.
<br>
<p>Exclusion potentially threatens safety (you don't get to share
<br>
the fire, meat, etc.) so the development of potential alliances,
<br>
dalliances, etc. where you are not fully aware of what is occurring
<br>
seem likely to raise red flags as well.
