<p>It depends how attached you are to an instantiation of yourself.
<br>
If one is living in a nano-enhanced world which is pretty much
<br>
a given in this situation -- then there probably aren't any &quot;real&quot;
<br>
consequences of being swapped.
<br>
<p>Sure, you wake up one morning and find you have a different wife,
<br>
different car, different kids, different friends, different job,
<br>
live in a different part of the solar system, etc.  Now, since
<br>
swapping has to be based on the technology to move memories and skills
<br>
around presumably there are representations of the &quot;essential&quot;
<br>
stuff relevant to living A's life before B woke up as A.
<br>
So you suspend consciousness for a brief moment, load up
<br>
all the &quot;A&quot;-ness specific information, resume consciousness
<br>
and now you are B+A.  It could get kind of interesting
<br>
playing musical chairs with all of your copies every morning.
<br>
It might be a challenge to give yourself increasingly less
<br>
&quot;A&quot;-ness, &quot;C&quot;-ness, &quot;D&quot;-ness, etc. to see if B + 0.9A + 0.8C + 0.7D
<br>
can actually survive in D's life or whether he turns out to
<br>
be completely incapable.  One might have some interesting results
<br>
because A+B may not equal B+A.  The next day one would have an
<br>
interesting dilemma as to whether to resolve the conflict
<br>
by subtracting the difference from one side, adding it
<br>
to the other or splitting the difference.
<br>
<p>It seems likely that the transhuman mind that could be developed
<br>
would be a meta-mind with data streams coming in from various
<br>
copies at various levels of compression and data rates (communication
<br>
bandwidths, costs etc.).  You would presumably be trying to optimize
<br>
your self-development through the experiences of your sub-minds.
<br>
At that point you have evolved to the level where your IDENTITY is not an
<br>
individual instantiation of yourself but the entire collective set of
<br>
instantiations.
