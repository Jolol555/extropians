<p>Ah, but if borders were completely opened, economies, standards of
<br>
living, and populations would equilibrate to the point where
<br>
population would offset resources, economic opportunities, and other
<br>
factors. Immigration into this country would be offset by emmigration
<br>
from it. The bad news is that in the short term, those in the West
<br>
would have to adjust to a lower standard of living. On the other hand,
<br>
the greater efficiency may result in faster growth that would offset
<br>
this. On the other other hand, maybe it is necessary to have elites
<br>
and concentrations of resources in some areas, to maintain
<br>
technological advancement instead of pouring all efforts into
<br>
supplying the worlds billions of bare essentials of life (nevermind
<br>
cryonics competing with space or nanotech as a research priority--
<br>
we'd see basic research altogether losing out to health delivery and
<br>
agriculture). Undecided about this one. Many unknowns.
