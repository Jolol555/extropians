<p>I can give you names of a great hairdresser, some really pleasant 
<br>
restaurants, interesting pubs, good places to buy clothes in 
<br>
Melbourne. Most of these things are not very exportable. I can't even 
<br>
buy the really nice, cheap Australian shiraz I used to drink in 
<br>
Melbourne here in Los Angeles (double sigh). The volume produced is 
<br>
too low to make it worth exporting, and simply buying it and shipping 
<br>
it out adds too much to the cost. Light things that are easy to ship 
<br>
do work: I recently purchased some finger puppets, handmade in 
<br>
Melbourne, for friends who had had a baby here in the US.
<br>
<p>Emigration to Australia won't increase your purchasing power. What 
<br>
you need is to live in Australia and be paid in US dollars. Mostly 
<br>
this happens for ex-pats of large corporations who come out and live 
<br>
in Sydney for a few years. Though the clever Damien B. seems to have 
<br>
also taken this up by publishing in the US (though if Damien was 
<br>
really clever he would now move to New Dehli and live like a king).
<br>
<p>This is very counterintuitive. I have had many discussions with 
<br>
friends where they absolutely do not understand why I am not living 
<br>
like a prince here in LA on my postdoc salary. They simply don't 
<br>
believe that I am paying the equivalent of $A1650/month rent, $A5 for 
<br>
a Starbucks coffee etc. Stop whining about money they say (probably 
<br>
true). You are earning big bucks (patently not true). Now if only 
<br>
Caltech would allow me to perform my postdoc in Melbourne, or at 
<br>
least allow me to go home for the weekend...
<br>
<p>I do believe that in a truly global free market economy lots of 
<br>
portable jobs will go to countries where the costs of living are 
<br>
cheaper and people are consequently willing to work for less. Whether 
<br>
programming is one of these jobs is an interesting question. Mike 
<br>
Lorrey seemed to be implying that this was not true. That he had lost 
<br>
his job to Indian programmers because of government corruption of the 
<br>
free market, and not true market forces.
<br>
<p>This discussion is also relevant to the question as to why 
<br>
programmers seemed to like to work in Palo Alto when the cost of 
<br>
living is so high (duh that's where the jobs are/were), but this begs 
<br>
the question as to why companies don't just setup were costs are 
<br>
cheaper. From a naive point of view it would seem the free market 
<br>
would force companies to move, but this ignores other less tangible 
<br>
monetary benefits from staying where the action is.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From my non-economic viewpoint it would seem to me that there are 
<br>
forces in some multidimensional space acting both to disperse workers 
<br>
and clump them together. This is presumably a very complex and 
<br>
dynamic system. Changes in technology alter the nature of this space 
<br>
and perhaps allow jobs previously clumped in one location -- 
<br>
programming in the continental USA -- to suddenly disperse to other 
<br>
locations around the planet.
<br>
<p>best, patrick
