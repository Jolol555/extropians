<em>&gt; Proposed FAQ question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since the Extropian movement is heavily invested in libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy,  which purportedly stresses individual rights and property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights, how do the Extropians reconcile the &quot;open borders&quot; philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocated by Extropians, with the fact that most American citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppose open borders (even before 911WTC numerous polls showed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 55-65% of Americans wanted less immigration, which is certainly a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way from open borders).  Seems as if Extropians would wish to trample
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual rights of most Americans by implementing open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; borders--not to mention taking the food out of the mouths of working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class Americans by lowering wages with immigration...or perhaps a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight reduction plan for the working classes is part of the Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy  :-)
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand your confusion: where's the contradiction?
<br>
Libertarian politics implies open borders (or rather, that the
<br>
government not restrict people's movements).  The majority of
<br>
Americans disagree--as would be expected, since the majority of
<br>
Americans are not libertarians.  The idea that advocating open
<br>
borders in some way infringes the rights of those who don't
<br>
believe in them gets it exactly backward: it is the act of
<br>
excluding people that is a violation of rights; if individual
<br>
Americans don't want to allow immigration /on their own land/,
<br>
a libertarian government would enforce their property rights.
<br>
If others wanted to allow unlimited immigration on /their/
<br>
land, a libertarian government would not interfere.  In that
<br>
way, /everyone's/ rights are protected, even the isolationists.
<br>
If the isolationists don't want to allow immigration to /other
<br>
people's land/, then it is they who are overstepping their power
<br>
and imposing their will on others.  It is not the business of
<br>
a libertarian government to support people who would violate
<br>
the rights of others to do what they want with their own land.
