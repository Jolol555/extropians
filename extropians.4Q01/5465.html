</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Since the Extropian movement is heavily invested in libertarian

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which purportedly stresses individual rights and property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rights, how do the Extropians reconcile the &quot;open borders&quot; philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advocated by Extropians,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This trips *right* into the transhumanist ethical dilemma.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll state it as harshly as I can -- do &quot;individual&quot; rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (from which property rights derive as an enforcement mechanism)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitle one to claim a greater share of the computronium (matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &amp; energy) and thereby deny others with relatively equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a priori claims their fair share?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Individual rights say nothing about denying anyone their &quot;fair
<br>
share&quot; of anything.  Classic individual rights are largely
<br>
negative - rights to not be interfered with in the pursuit of
<br>
life, liberty and so on - rather than postive rights that one
<br>
can demand of others.  There is nothing inherent in pursuing
<br>
one's own life that necessarily deprives others of anything at
<br>
all.  On utilitarian grounds at least, some effort toward
<br>
insuring that as many others as possible can maximally
<br>
contribute is likely to be in the interest of self and society.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think this can be simplified -- &quot;Which is better -- natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection or fairness?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think that is far too simplified.  Both are really muddy
<br>
concepts when applied to societal ethical questions.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm fairly sure that I've said it before but it is probably worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeating -- if you opt for fairness (the human &quot;social animal&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preference most likely) you are likely to end up with sub-optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But it is not at all clear that simple adaptation a la some
<br>
social darwinian model are at all applicable much less optimal
<br>
to such a question.  So the &quot;which is better&quot; starts with an
<br>
artificially delimited set of alternatives in my view.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is in some respects a recasting of the captialism vs. socialism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or communism approaches to societal organization (yea, I'm sure the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readers well versed in political history may slice this analogy into diced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ham, but from my arm-chair position [not too different from J. Q. Public]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it works).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To me these are more doubtful and befuddling analogies that
<br>
don't really address the question at hand cleanly.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the fact that most American citizens oppose open borders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In spite of the fact that most Americans are descended from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who took advantage of relatively open borders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In part this is natural human xenophobia and in part this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is simple economics -- wanting to preserve the advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (position, connections, environmental adaptations, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one has developed over one or more generations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>But that bit of reasoning assumes relative scarcity and static
<br>
models of wealth.  Both of these are increasingly dated.  One
<br>
already has the clear advantage.  Why is it also necessary or
<br>
felt to be so to deny entry completely to others?  To me, this
<br>
could only be justified if one's own position was not
<br>
sustainable in the face of competition.  But in this case, it is
<br>
not in the interest of &quot;natural selection&quot; to preserve that
<br>
which is relatively competitively inept.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Make it really simple -- Why should I as a taxpayer with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no children in the city of Seattle be paying taxes to educate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the children of the XYZZY class of immigrants?  The only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational arguments I can make for this are if I plan to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an employer and I expect to need an educated workforce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or an extropian who would like more educated rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in the world -- but that is probably really stretching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public educational system).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That doesn't make it simple.  It confuses the root issue with a
<br>
lot of other questions about what you should have to pay for as
<br>
a taxpayer generally.  However, you do hit on one part of the
<br>
benefit of supporting immigration and that is to possibly
<br>
produced more skilled workers and rational people.  That the
<br>
public education system is sorely lacking is an aside not
<br>
especially relevant to the specific question of course.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The immigration system by its very nature was designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promote production -- ~200 years ago it was designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promote the production of furs.  ~100-150 years ago it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to promote the production of metals and food.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ~50-100 years ago it was designed to promote industrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing.  It is my sense that the immigration policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is now passed on because those of us whose ancestors at one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point were able to use it as a point of leverage feel it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is only just that others should be able to do so as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words its a &quot;generous gift&quot; and not a &quot;right&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This also seems not terribly relevant.  If we have open borders
<br>
and there are no jobs doable by the immigrants then they will
<br>
not continue to come in.  If we have jobs and training
<br>
opportunities then we get benefit and competitive advantages by
<br>
letting them in.  Gift vs. right has nothing really to do with
<br>
it as I see it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; To resolve this problem from an ethical perspective, one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to construct a complete view of precisely what obligation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any human has with regard to the survival opportunities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any and each other human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it is better tackled not from so much an obligation
<br>
basis as from the relative benefit to oneself of enabling more
<br>
human beings to have a better life.  One such benefit was
<br>
mentioned above in the increase of trained and intelligent
<br>
persons which in turn means that there is a larger intelligent
<br>
workforce to be applied to projects of great interest and
<br>
benefit to us. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Seems as if Extropians would wish to trample
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the individual rights of most Americans by implementing open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; borders--not to mention taking the food out of the mouths of working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; class Americans by lowering wages with immigration...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Since it is increasingly unlikely that the majority of US jobs
<br>
or even a non-declining number of them are relatively unskilled
<br>
and since many skilled jobs go begging, I hardly see why more
<br>
immigration of the mostly unskilled is likely to have any real
<br>
effect on the wages of skilled workers nor why increasing the
<br>
number of skilled workers is not a net benefit.   If the costs
<br>
of some types of labor go down then the costs of what is
<br>
produced is less which is a net benefit to all consumers of
<br>
those goods and services.  Also, in the case of more skilled
<br>
work especially, the cost of producing something new and
<br>
beneficial in the world goes down.  Again, this looks like a net
<br>
benefit.
<br>
<p>I would also like to point out an incipient contradiction. 
<br>
Above the supposedly more positive benefits of natural selection
<br>
are heralded in even complex problems like this one.  However,
<br>
later on there is urging to abandon the free market / natural
<br>
selection mechanism of letting the jobs go to the lowest capable
<br>
bidder.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; One could have an open border policy with no guarantess of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rights to work&quot; policy.  With sufficiently strict enforcement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there would be no lowering of wages.  One could have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;right to work&quot; and &quot;pay social security&quot; with no rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is no &quot;right to work&quot; now for non-immigrants so it is a
<br>
canard to claim it as relevant for immigrants.  Wages should
<br>
reflect the relative value and supply dynamics of labor, they
<br>
should not be strictly enforced by some non-market mechanism.
