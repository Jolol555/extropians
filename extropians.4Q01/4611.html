<em>&gt; Consider &quot;good relations with the west&quot; as a resource.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...] Destroying good relations, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with those neighbors who have a lot of money and power, is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the best interest of any nation, analogous to torching one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own oil fields.
</em><br>
<p>I agree and would even extend this to &quot;good relations lead to 
<br>
interdependence&quot; and &quot;interdependence prevents war, because everyone would 
<br>
lose more than he could win&quot;. If you have the choice, it's always better to 
<br>
invest into infrastructure, agriculture and development than into weapons 
<br>
and destruction.
<br>
<p>This would mean, that at least the arabian/palestinian activists believe 
<br>
that they win more when they lose their life, their houses and their 
<br>
families. What could make them believe this? Desperation? The feeling that 
<br>
noone will really help them? Probably. If this is the case, then this has 
<br>
to be solved first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So let the Middle Eastern nations do as the Jews have done,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; send some of their brightest and best to Europe, to America,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Asia.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a very good idea. It could be too late, though. The terror 
<br>
pilots of 9-11 have lived and studied in Europe for years (in Hamburg i.e., 
<br>
&lt;100 miles from here *shiver*). One even was born in Germany and has never 
<br>
lived in the middle east. So, there must be a mechanism by which the 
<br>
anti-western, islamic-fundamentalist meme set wins over an already 
<br>
established western meme set and I really would like to know how this works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a vision of the Christian, the Arab and the Jew sitting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the park together and commiserating that their grandsons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are far more interested in mastering the subtleties of nintendo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the bible, the koran or the torah.  May it be so.
</em><br>
<p>And may this day not be too far away.
