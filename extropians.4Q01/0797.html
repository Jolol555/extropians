It would make sense that a &quot;good&quot; negative ion generator should
<br>
impact on bacteria.  Bacteria generate energy by pumping hydrogen
<br>
(H+) ions out of the cell.  Those ions flow back across the
<br>
ion gradient through ATP synthase to generate the ATP the bacteria
<br>
require for other biochemical functions.  Negative ions in the
<br>
environment outside the cell would presumably reduce the ion
<br>
gradient and/or bind the hydrogen ions depleating the ability
<br>
of the bacteria to synthesize ATP.
<br>
<p>Similarly, if the outer protein coat of a non-enveloped virus (or the
<br>
proteins embedded in the lipid membrane of an enveloped virus) are dependent
<br>
on positively charged amino acids for binding to cellular receptors,
<br>
negatively charged ions would be attracted to those amino acids and serve
<br>
to disrupt receptor binding.  The fact that probably only a limited
<br>
subset of viruses require such amino acids for receptor binding
<br>
explains why ion generators would be less effective against them.
<br>
<p>Anthrax spores are essentially bacterial &quot;seeds&quot;.  It is difficult
<br>
to imagine how an ion generator could &quot;sterilize&quot; them without
<br>
continuous ion production.  You need chemicals that can penetrate
<br>
the spore or radiation that permanently damages their DNA to
<br>
neutralize them.  Spores are very hardy which is why getting
<br>
rid of them generally requires a &quot;scorched earth&quot; approach.
<br>
<p>There are methods scientists have developed to utilize proteins
<br>
to disrupt the anthrax toxin (something potentially much more
<br>
effective and faster acting than antibiotics or vaccinations). 
<br>
See:
<br>

<br>
<p>But once these anti-toxin therapies become generally known,
<br>
terrorists can presumably utilize similar methods to evolve
<br>
toxins that can avoid the specific strategies utilized by
<br>
the anti-toxins.  There will clearly be an arms race if
<br>
terrorist organizations have sufficient funding to build
<br>
molecular biology laboratories.  Fortunately, at least for
<br>
now, such labs are expensive and provide relatively obvious
<br>
targets.  But the development of &quot;lab-on-a-chip&quot; solutions
<br>
within the biotechnology industry may very well make that
<br>
situation a fleeting guarantee of security.
<br>
<p>One has to wonder how many terrorist sleeper agents are attending
<br>
classes in molecular biology at universities in the more developed
<br>
countries now and when the governments will wake up sufficiently
<br>
to realize that the high-speed centrifuges of the '80s are the
<br>
DNA and protein synthesizers of today.
