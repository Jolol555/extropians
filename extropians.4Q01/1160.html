<em>&gt;I believe some of the M (for Metal) type asteroids have, indeed, been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;estimated to have huge amounts of gold.  By &quot;huge&quot;, I mean &quot;of similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or greater mass than the sum total of said metal humans have dredged up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the history of said species&quot;.  I definitely remember that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;description applied to the amount of stainless steel in one M type
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asteroid.  And these are M type asteroids that, at their closest, pass
</em><br>
<em>&gt;closer to the Earth than the Moon itself.  It is at least theoretically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible to decelerate these things into medium-to-low Earth orbit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where they could be mined for raw wealth and scientific data.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that Segan estimated in &quot;Pale Blue Dot&quot; (would you believe it, 
<br>
the only book award that was actually a book was the one from Cornell) that 
<br>
an average M asteroid would have trillions of dollars of precious metals at 
<br>
current market prices, and enough heavy metals to last two or three years 
<br>
of normal consumption.  Of course, we can all say &quot;market glut&quot; but it 
<br>
still seems a good investment.  I suspect that we could get an astroid into 
<br>
medium Earth orbit with not too much equipment mass.  On the other hand, 
<br>
getting the stuff mined and down to Earth would be tough.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Can you say &quot;ka-CHING!&quot;?  ^_^
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, but it might take a few asteroids before you pay off the infrastructure.
