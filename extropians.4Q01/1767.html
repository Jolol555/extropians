<p><p>The first part is possible, the second part isn't.  If you can hear it, you
<br>
can make a bootleg.  Furthermore, even if you did remove the S/PDIF digital
<br>
outputs and similar from cheap consumer gear like my Sony CD player (which
<br>
allows lossless copies to be made) and don't let computers read .AIFFs off
<br>
the CD through hardware enforcement, you've only made it slightly more
<br>
difficult.
<br>
<p>The major problem, even with vigorous hardware enforcement, is that pro
<br>
audio editing/mixing/mastering/recording gear can't be hardware restricted
<br>
without rendering it nigh useless.  A tool is a tool, you can't restrict its
<br>
function (because it would then be useless) nor can you know ahead of time
<br>
what the owner is going to do with it.  Due to the price slashing effect of
<br>
technological advancement, these devices are available from you local
<br>
musicians hangout for only slightly more than consumer gear.  A lot of
<br>
people buy pro-sumer level audio gear because it is better built than
<br>
consumer grade stuff anyway.  Audio data handling is extremely versatile
<br>
these days, even at the consumer level, and I don't see how hardware
<br>
restrictions would limit anyone who intended to distribute music illegally.
<br>
It is akin to the gun control laws that limit people from owning certain
<br>
types of guns; the only people it really prevents from purchasing them are
<br>
people who wouldn't have been inclined towards criminal activity in the
<br>
first place.  Legal speed bumps are the worst kinds of laws, because they
<br>
exist solely to make things difficult for people who follow the law.  They
<br>
don't actually prevent anything, they just modify the market.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If I had the political clout, I'd go after the backbone itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filter from the NAPs and you could stop all of this traffic in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S.
</em><br>
<p><p>How would you tell the difference between the massive flow of perfectly
<br>
legal MP3s and illegal ones, when there is no technical difference?  It
<br>
sounds like an all or nothing solution.  I've downloaded gigabytes of MP3s
<br>
from various sources that were intended to be downloaded by the owners.
<br>
I've never committed a copyright violation, so how would my legal but
<br>
apparently identical traffic be distinguished from the illegal traffic?
