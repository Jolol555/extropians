Daniel:
<br>
<p>Thank you very much for your feedback regarding my question about
<br>
Jacqueline De Romilly and Jean-Pierre Vernant.
<br>
<p>Regarding your words about Odysseus:
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Technotranscendence&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:neptune@mars.superlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Homerian%20epics%20(was:%20French%20culture%20and%20extropianism)&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b8209fa959f6@[213.7.131.187]&gt;">neptune@mars.superlink.net</a>&gt;, Thu, 15 Nov 2001:
<br>
<em>&gt;For instance, with Odysseus, it may be true that he is different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from many other Greek heroes, BUT he is there nonetheless and in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of their most celebrated and influential poems.  Therefore, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see him as less examplary.  I see him, in fact, as a sort of break
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with earlier heroes.  The Greeks were still mired in the old, too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but they also had this new type of hero -- a hero of the mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Notably, Odysseus' strong suit -- in terms of character; it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious he was no whimp and also had some gods on his side -- is his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;ability to think through just any situation.)  So, I don't dismiss
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him from the pantheon of Greek heroes, though he's very different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from most of the rest.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that he is an impressive character, and heroes _are_
<br>
important, however, he might be a little too 'clear-cut'....
<br>
<p>As a story, _The Odyssey, is more approachable than _The Iliad_:
<br>
it's a little like the adventure films we know with clear-cut
<br>
characters. Odysseus struggles against external villains,
<br>
seductresses, cannibals, his own mutinous men, the suitors in his
<br>
home. In the process of returning home, he undergoes an 'internal
<br>
pilgrimage' as well.
<br>
<p>I think that the complex character Achilles in _the Iliad_, has a
<br>
large value to transhumanists because his situations are more
<br>
similar to what we are now, and what we will face in the near
<br>
future. Achilles' struggles are primarily reflections of his fight
<br>
with the *beast within*. It's a confrontation with the tensions
<br>
within human nature that lurk in us underneath our civilation's
<br>
veneer. Achilles withdraws from his community, a ruinous existence,
<br>
then wrestles his beast in a more ruinous way via his vengeance. The
<br>
reader then see what happens when vengeance goes too far. When he
<br>
becomes angry, his anger does not allow him to accept changes or
<br>
shifts in attitude, and he embarks upon a murderous rampage. Yet he
<br>
undergoes a startling transformation. After he is wronged and
<br>
becomes angry, he withdraws from his environment, and, while alone,
<br>
realizes that the entire martial system of honor is bankrupt and
<br>
based on a lie. Achilles' heroism at his end is quite different than
<br>
Odysseus' too: Odysseus regains his kin through the sheer strength
<br>
of his spirit and the power of his genius; Achilles loses what
<br>
family he had, to claim some new sense of honor well beyond a world
<br>
that he wants no part of.
<br>
<p>As in most of the Greek classics, the following important ideas are
<br>
presented: learning comes through effort, men are social creatures,
<br>
human life is tragically short and therefore comes with obligations,
<br>
character is a matter of matching words with deeds, religion is
<br>
separate from and subordinate to politics, private property should
<br>
be immune from government coercion, the truth only emerges through
<br>
dissent and open criticism, the most dangerous animal is the beast
<br>
within us, leaders ignore the will of the assembly at their peril.
<br>
In the Iliad, these ideas are again presented, but more honestly than
<br>
the other epic, and without apology and elaboration.
<br>
<p>Have a good Thanksgiving, and rest of December and New Years.
<br>
<p>Amara
