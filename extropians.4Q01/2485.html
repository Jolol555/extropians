<p>
&quot;Let the Afghans tell you&quot;? Which Afghans, specifically?
<br>
<p>It might be time to rent a copy of _The Man Who Would Be King_.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Billy Fish: &quot;[He says] 'Oh, MANY enemies, all terrible! The worst
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are the [ununtelligible name of tribe]. Piss in streams,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scare womens doing washings.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;later&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Billy Fish: &quot;He says he prefer to be called 'Uttar the Terrible'!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Peachy:     &quot;Then 'Uttar the Terrible' it shall be!&quot;
<br>
<p>Arrogance and hypocrisy are Amara's labels. OK.
<br>
Anders came up with some more.
<br>
<p>Ignorance, shallowness, impatience, a short attention span, and credulity are
<br>
ones I'd like to add to the pot. Then there's &quot;commitment&quot; (see below).
<br>
<p>&lt;/rantmode=ON&gt;
<br>
<p>Sometimes I think that the best analogy might be that, X-Files-like,
<br>
USA culture is like a nice kind hardworking guy with an inoperable
<br>
astrocytoma that leads to frequent psychomotor epilepsy blackouts.
<br>
<p>I'd also like to mention that Ike's &quot;military-industrial complex&quot;
<br>
had a different name when he was fighting the Axis. And that it's
<br>
clear to me that there exist effective daisy chains comprising elites
<br>
(or would-be elites) in all areas of influence and power. Not just in
<br>
the US, but let's limit our discussion for now.
<br>
<p>At least _some_ hungry (a)newsies, (b)Hollywood types, (c)politicians, (d)captains 
<br>
of industry are busy scratching each other's backs (to clean up my actual 
<br>
image). They don't have to have any more detailed agenda than &quot;give a little,
<br>
get a little&quot;. Clearly, more than one bloc is present. The total number of 
<br>
active core members of all such groups, the &quot;real players&quot;, might be few.
<br>
There is ebb and flow. Who is bankable? Who has buzz? How's the spin
<br>
playing in Peoria?
<br>
<p>This is not a devil theory, this is how the game is played.
<br>
<p>I have finally had a chance to look at Bartley's _Retreat to Commitment_,
<br>
and I find I must say that pancritical rationalism is not much in evidence
<br>
in the public today. 39 years it's been sitting there.
<br>
<p>Bartley probably overrated intellectual honesty.
<br>
<p>The first thing most people retreat to is always commitment, it seems.
<br>
I don't exclude this list. I admit to having done my share of it.
<br>
<p>&quot;The primary purpose of thinking is to abolish thinking.&quot;--E. de Bono in a saturnine mood.
<br>
<p>Sometimes one _must_ retreat to commitment. But I want it to be my last refuge
<br>
as much of the time as is practicable.
<br>
<p>There is another voice which has been silent of late. I miss Lee Corbin,
<br>
and I've seen nothing from him since 8/30/2001. I started being
<br>
bugged by him, then came around to understanding and valuing his approach.
<br>
<p>I think I grew up a bit. I think we could use more application of the 
<br>
pancritical rationalist approach on this list. That would be Extropian,
<br>
says a man who's never paid ExI any dues.
<br>
<p>So, Amara, all:
<br>
<p>When I look at the world, I see that lots of people have done bad, shortsighted 
<br>
or stupid things. Abuse of power? you bet. Convenience as the highest good? Sure.
<br>
Some people have exploited others. Many others have not. There has been a war in
<br>
the Sudan, for, literally, as long as I have been alive.
<br>
<p>You see, _many people hold *grudges* as the things most precious_. And some 
<br>
pissed-off loudmouth on the other side of the world has said, dead serious,
<br>
that it's OK to kill me--me personally--because I paid taxes, at effective gunpoint
<br>
&lt;I can pay the tax or go to Leavenworth or resist arrest. Great choice.&gt;, 
<br>
to people who have done things of which he disapproves. He doesn't care if
<br>
I disapprove, too. The damage is done, in his eyes.
<br>
<p>Let me reiterate. Obi-L wants me dead until all infidels are out of Saudi
<br>
Arabia. Well, that's what he wanted a few weeks ago. Now he's talking about Israel,
<br>
I hear. Well, I think I'd be better off if I wasn't buying gas from Wahhabists,
<br>
myself. But this is a very sticky mess, and it won't get unfscked very fast.
<br>
<p>I think there are a lot of unscrupulous, evil people. I don't doubt that some have
<br>
been American citizens. But I don't feel like being killed today, thanks just the
<br>
same, even if Gen. Smedley Butler was 100% correct when he said &quot;War is a racket.&quot;
<br>
<p>The one highest good I find in the notions of US culture is tucked in a top corner of
<br>
the Declaration of Independence, so out of the way that no modern politician of any success
<br>
will even see it on his radar if asked the question &quot;What is the purpose of government?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,&quot;
<br>
<p>And they had the gall to hold that it was self-evident. What BRASS! I love it. I'm the man I am today because I grew up
<br>
believing it. But it takes an act of faith. It's not self-evident at all.
<br>
<p>The most charitable description of the facts of governments of the day is that they existed to keep people feeling
<br>
safe--that their lives were not totally chaotic--and that if they played by the rules, they could live quietly until
<br>
death took them, without having their villages burned and their pottery smashed every time marauders came 'round.
<br>
Powerful people got to feel even safer than everyone else, of course.
<br>
<p>Today? You tell me. I don't see America's foreign _or_ domestic policy holding the torch very high, on balance.
<br>
But I WANT IT TO. And I don't want to get murdered in the meantime.
<br>
<p>&lt;/rantmode=OFF&gt;
<br>
<p>And I favor multiplex answers, too. But what to do about those who don't, even after I leave them alone?
