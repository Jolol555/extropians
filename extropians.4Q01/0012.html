Extropian friends,
<br>
<p>Please do not think ill of me.  I found this on
<br>
Eurekalert at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-09/cuco-pmi092801.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-09/cuco-pmi092801.php</a>
<br>
<p>and well, Anders has challenged me to seek out my own
<br>
cultural myth.  That self-examination provokes this
<br>
offering. ;-)

<p><p>Prayer may influence in vitro fertilization success
<br>
<p>Blinded and randomized international study reveals
<br>
surprising results
<br>
<p>New York, NY-Prayer seems to almost double the success
<br>
rate of in vitro fertilization procedures that lead to
<br>
pregnancy, according to surprising results from a
<br>
study carefully designed to eliminate bias. 
<br>
<p>The controversial findings, published in the September
<br>
issue of the Journal of Reproductive Medicine, reveal
<br>
that a group of women who had people praying for them
<br>
had a 50 percent pregnancy rate compared to a 26
<br>
percent rate in the group of women who did not have
<br>
people praying for them. None of the women undergoing
<br>
the IVF procedures knew about the praying. 
<br>
<p>The researchers acknowledge the results seem
<br>
incredible and say unknown biological factors may be
<br>
playing a role in the difference between the two
<br>
groups. But they decided to go public with the results
<br>
in the hope that other scientists may carry out
<br>
studies to determine if the findings are reproducible
<br>
and, if so, what factors might be responsible for the
<br>
improved success rate in the group of women who had
<br>
people praying for them. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We could have ignored the findings, but that would
<br>
not help to advance the field,&quot; says Dr. Rogerio Lobo,
<br>
chairman of obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) at
<br>
Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons
<br>
and lead author of the study. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We are putting the results out there hoping to
<br>
provoke discussion and see if anything can be learned
<br>
from it. We would like to understand the biological or
<br>
other phenomena that led to this almost doubling of
<br>
the pregnancy rate.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The study, which had several safeguards in place to
<br>
eliminate bias, involved 199 women planning in vitro
<br>
fertilization and embryo transfers at the Cha Hospital
<br>
in Seoul, Korea, between December 1998 and March 1999.
<br>
A statistician randomly assigned the prospective
<br>
mothers to either a prayer group (100 women) or a
<br>
non-prayer group (99). Besides the women, the
<br>
physicians and medical personnel caring for the women
<br>
did not know a study of prayer was ongoing. 
<br>
<p>The people praying for the women lived in the United
<br>
States, Canada, and Australia and were incapable of
<br>
knowing or contacting the women undergoing the
<br>
procedures. Which women were in which group was not
<br>
revealed until the pregnancy data became available at
<br>
the completion of the study. The people praying were
<br>
from Christian denominations and were separated into
<br>
three groups. One group received pictures of the women
<br>
and prayed for an increase in their pregnancy rate.
<br>
Another group prayed to improve the effectiveness of
<br>
the first group. A third group prayed for the two
<br>
other groups. Anecdotal evidence from other prayer
<br>
research has found this method to be most effective.
<br>
The three groups began to pray within five days of the
<br>
initial hormone treatment that stimulates egg
<br>
development and continued to pray for three weeks. 
<br>
<p>Besides finding a higher pregnancy rate among the
<br>
women who had a group praying for them, the
<br>
researchers found older women seemed to benefit more
<br>
from prayer. For women between 30 and 39, the
<br>
pregnancy rate for the prayer group was 51 percent,
<br>
compared with 23 percent for the non-prayer group. 
<br>
<p>The researchers analyzed their data several ways to
<br>
see if they could find other variables that would have
<br>
accounted for the differences between the two groups.
<br>
However, no adjustments altered the results. The group
<br>
will continue to study whether its findings are
<br>
genuine and, if so, what mechanisms might be at work. 
<br>
<p>Other studies have shown that prayer seems to exert a
<br>
benefit for heart patients. The researchers believe
<br>
theirs is the first study looking at prayer and
<br>
infertility. 
<br>
<p><p>###
<br>
None of the researchers are employed by religious
<br>
organizations and were not asked by religious groups
<br>
to perform the study. Dr. Kwang Y. Cha, director of
<br>
the Cha Hospital and an associate research scientist
<br>
at OB/GYN at Columbia University College of Physicians
<br>
&amp; Surgeons, funded the research through his hospital.
