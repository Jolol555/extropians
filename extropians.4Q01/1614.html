In answer to Alex's question about
<br>
<p>&quot;When is an MP3 file *not* like a lighthouse?&quot;
<br>
<p>The answer is when people really feel &quot;entertained&quot;
<br>
and want to contribute to the people who provided that.
<br>
<p>I've been listening to Venessa-Mae's Storm the last
<br>
couple of days (I may take days to weeks to change
<br>
a CD).  I purchased it once and can enjoy it many times.
<br>
<p>People should be clear that the RIAA/MPAA are trying
<br>
to move to a model that denies me that ability
<br>
(in violation of the &quot;personal use&quot; rights of
<br>
copyright law).  See:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2001oct/gee20011022008460.htm">http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2001oct/gee20011022008460.htm</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;downloads will cost 7 cents per song and must be tied to a
<br>
&nbsp;particular computer, where they will expire after a month&quot;
<br>
[i.e. they are trying to take away the ability for you to
<br>
permanently purchase the copyright -- they want to move
<br>
to a pay-per-listen/view rather than a permanent licence
<br>
model.]
<br>
<p>I would be happy to utilize a program that *I* controlled
<br>
that monitored what songs I played and based on my subjective
<br>
assessment of my enjoyment of those songs did micropayment &quot;tipping&quot;
<br>
directly to the artists (I'd tip Vanessa-Mae more than I'd tip
<br>
Marilyn Manson -- but thats just me).
<br>
<p>I think Emlyn's point about who pays the producers or Lee's points
<br>
about &quot;good&quot; marketing people adding value are important.
<br>
People who &quot;tune&quot; rough artists and people who can develop
<br>
non-intrusive means of educating the public about good
<br>
artists *do* provide value.  It would be a very different
<br>
world if they were paid by the *artists* rather than by
<br>
the record or movie companies.
<br>
<p>I think the extropic focus of the thread should be on how
<br>
to develop systems (education, distribution, etc.) that would
<br>
support artists to a greater extent while at the same time
<br>
maximizing the pleasure that listeners &amp; viewers obtain
<br>
from various entertainment sources.
<br>
<p>Free bits are not inherently extropic bits.
<br>
<p>Robert
