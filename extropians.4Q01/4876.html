&lt;&lt;The Alan Greenspan/Paul Krugman explanation seems to be
<br>
very Keynesian: human irrationality took over.  This doesn't explain
<br>
anything.  Why did irrationality take over then and not sooner or later?
<br>
Instead, the answer lies in the inflationary and regulatory policies
<br>
pursued during that period. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Many economists would indicate that the entire marketplace is wracked by 
<br>
irrationality; irrational exuberence, irrational pessimism, irrational greed, 
<br>
ad naseum. What I seem to recall from the last 18 months, is the beliefs that 
<br>
the economic goodtimes were over (in part) because of the OPEC creeps, 
<br>
jacking up prices. Whether this is true, is open to question.
<br>
<p>I would claim the mere perception of such an occurence, was enough to pop the 
<br>
dot.com bubble. Remember, that Greenspan was using the post WW2 German model 
<br>
that inflation causes recession/depression and that low inflation was the 
<br>
target-goal. The method was to use minetary policy to prevent the typical 
<br>
'business cycle' to close, and thus, perpetuate the prosperity that we 
<br>
experienced during most of the 1990's. My Comment: Clinton was a liar and a 
<br>
whoredog, but he was wise enough not to screw up a good thing, with Greenspan 
<br>
doing German-style banking policy.
<br>
<p>Further comment: German style anti-inflationary policy, in order to ensure a 
<br>
prosperity, does not work when the cause of inflation in outside of banking 
<br>
control. What is outside of banking control? The OPEC bastards, or more 
<br>
formally, the Wahabbis. My sense is that the dot.com bomb, combined with the 
<br>
foolishness of government policy in California, helped jack up the price of 
<br>
domestic natural gas costs. Remember that?
<br>
<p>The economy was deflating during 2000, and all the interest-rate cuts have 
<br>
done squat (although iy supposedly takes at least 12 mos for the interest 
<br>
rate cuts to generate a response). 9-11 transformed the economy from a weak 
<br>
one, into a recessionary one. Which points up the need to develop an 
<br>
alternative to petroleum.
