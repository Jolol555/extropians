<em>&gt; Subject: RE: Posthuman Politics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of an entire country's population.  Strategies that require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of a population to participate have been known to succeed.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American Revolution succeeded.  Martin Luther King succeeded.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything on that massive a scale takes billions of dollars, a core group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of activists willing to devote their entire lives to the problem, and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it still takes a generation to set up the initial conditions if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't been set up already.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, unless the small group gets lucky because events go
<br>
their way (Bolsheviks &amp;c). I have a twin track aim anyway of
<br>
education and social change, and am very aware that some
<br>
processes will take much longer than others. But even accepting
<br>
your point in full, still better to start sooner rather than later. It
<br>
shows confidence if you can argue your political/ philosophical
<br>
position in public against rival viewpoints ... this reason by
<br>
itself justifies the political engagement of POSTHUMANs with
<br>
the legacy political systems from the human-been era that we all
<br>
have to currently exist with. We should want a SAY in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe I'm just boring and uninspired, but I'm all for a sensible plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with short, mid, and long-term components... I just don't see &quot;radically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altering the nature of the human body and spacetime itself through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology and AI&quot; as part of a five-year plan, unless (and this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still a big maybe, not that it matters since it's not going to happen)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every single global resource that wasn't going towards maintaining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic human and technical infrastructure to support a society capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a project were put on the project itself. (Or someone gets really,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really &quot;lucky&quot;.)
</em><br>
<p>Agree. This is just one possible outcome. I think it more urgent to
<br>
change the archaic mind-set that humans operate on, and think that
<br>
the solution of the mind-body problem (MVT) offers a new range of
<br>
applications and experience-expansion possibilities that are towards
<br>
a fuller, more correct understanding of our own natures as E-1 mammals.
<br>
<p>We should utilise natural resources and abilities that we already have
<br>
in better ways before leaping into unknown radical
<br>
technological changes that are IRREVERSIBLE and which may
<br>
ultimately turn out to be undesirable. We don't want to scare
<br>
Joe Public by being too gung ho and incautious, nor present
<br>
ourselves as sci-fi anoraks and laughable trekkies.
