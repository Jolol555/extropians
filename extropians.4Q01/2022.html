<em>&gt; So we are left to deal with why piracy occurs. Outside of skinflints who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want to pay for something, and spoiled brats who think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything should be free, you have a core audience of the economically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disadvantaged that the first two groups piggyback on. Perhaps with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion of micropayment schemes, there could also be instituted a sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of micro-financial aid, where those on public assistance and those in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school would get a hefty discount or even waived fees in electronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music distribution. Instituting such a program would eliminate much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the piracy propaganda, while at the same time attaching a stigma to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting 'free music', which would imply that you are on an economic low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rung, something that peer pressure concious youths try very hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid.
</em><br>
<p>Who are you and what have you done with Michael Lorrey?  Immigrants
<br>
create a low-trust market?  Public assistance for music?  Big
<br>
corporations taking advantage of poor artists?
<br>
<p>You seem to have some disdain for those who &quot;want something for
<br>
nothing&quot;, so why doesn't that apply to the artists as well--why
<br>
are they entitled to _continue_ getting paid royalties long after
<br>
their creative work is done?  Do I have to pay Kirk Gibson every
<br>
time I watch him hit that home run?  If an artists is paid to
<br>
create something, why is that (plus getting paid for live
<br>
performances and whatever other work he can get) not enough?  Why
<br>
must he use the force of law to extort more money from everyone who
<br>
might benefit from his work, when he is not doing anything more?
<br>
What's different about &quot;creative&quot; work than any other kind of
<br>
ordinary work that it deserves continued payment after-the-fact? 
<br>
<p>I know the standard justification is that without that payment-
<br>
after-the-fact, there will be insufficient incentive to produce.
<br>
I just don't buy it.  How do you measure &quot;sufficient&quot; incentive?
<br>
What's enough, and what's too much?  Lots of great art got produced
<br>
before copyrights, and lots of money is made today despite P2P
<br>
software.
<br>
<p>To me, the only thing different about creative work is precisely
<br>
that it _can_ be reproduced at near-zero cost.  Therefore, it does
<br>
make sense for artists and inventors to enter into contracts that
<br>
ensure that their initial payment is commensurate with the value
<br>
of the work--that's a difficult thing to do in some cases (like
<br>
speculative research).  That's what we should be talking about
<br>
here--what methods can artists and inventors use--given the real
<br>
state of technology, not reliance on old laws that don't fit the
<br>
technology--to make enough money to keep them creating?  And that
<br>
should have the added benefit that those artists whose work is
<br>
_not_ sufficiently valuable to earn a living absent present law
<br>
will go into more productive lines of work.
