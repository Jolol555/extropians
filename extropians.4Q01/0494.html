<p>Lifestyle diseases seem to be a serious problem, in fact likely
<br>
far worse than endogenous diseases. These seem to be largely due
<br>
to our evolutionary past not meshing well with our technological
<br>
abilities to fulfill genetically promoted wishes - the energy
<br>
retaining drive makes us couch potatos, the drive for scarce
<br>
calories gives us cardiovascular disease and so on. Fortunately
<br>
this is of course possible to change - unfortunately it seems
<br>
that overcoming habits is in itself very hard (it is not hard to 
<br>
*do*, but it is harder to get oneself to truly *want* it).

</em><br>
<p>Ah, at last a metaselfhelp book! I have been looking for
<br>
something like that for a long time. 
<br>
<p>Of course, in a psychological study I read of who read self help
<br>
books the result was that the people reading them were those who
<br>
where motivated, had high self-esteem and liked to be in charge
<br>
of their lives. I.e. the people with the least need for the books
<br>
:-)
