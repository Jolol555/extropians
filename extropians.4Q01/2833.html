</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't we have a layer of iridium lined throughout much of the world, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be explained via volcanic eruption/deposition? Plus, there is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cratering that nicely, fits in with the Yucatan penninsula. And that fits in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the creation, via hydrostatic shock, of the Deccan Traps in India.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where are the descendents of the dinosaurs, then-just birds? No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broto-juniors, no giant nautilus, washing up on our beaches, ruining surfing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events?  Feh!   What about the Permian (non?) Extinction, of 250 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago?
</em><br>
<p>Just because an impact happened doesnt necessarily mean that it wiped
<br>
out the life forms directly, and fossil deposition is a tricky business
<br>
to date. 
<br>
<p>For example, it is now conclusively shown that the West Antarctic Ice
<br>
Cap has been stable for at least the last 15 million years, withstanding
<br>
global temperature changes as much as 4 deg C warmer than present levels
<br>
without any collapse. Despite this, there are plateaus of wave action
<br>
sedimentation on the continent with fossilized birch roots that date to
<br>
only 4.5 million years that would seem to indicate that not only was sea
<br>
level higher significantly at that point, but that Antarctica was
<br>
significantly warmer than at present, enough to collapse the ice cap
<br>
(birch trees require summer temps of at least 5 deg C to survive).
<br>
Rather, it is more probable that the birch roots arrived via ocean
<br>
currents and tsunami action, as the circumpolar currents did not become
<br>
fully established until 4.5 million years ago..
