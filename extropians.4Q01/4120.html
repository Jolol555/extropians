<em>&gt; The question is, if I peed into my urine-powered clock before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I went to bed every night, would it provide enough power so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would keep good time when I woke up 8 hours later?
</em><br>
<p>Actually the liquid just supplies a conductive electrolyte and is
<br>
not the source of the energy.  A salt solution will work as well.
<br>
See <a href="http://rabi.phys.virginia.edu/HTW/flashlights.html">http://rabi.phys.virginia.edu/HTW/flashlights.html</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you run a clock off of a potato?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The classic technique is to insert two dissimilar metal strips into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the potato in order to build a simple battery. You can then run an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electronic clock with the power provided by that battery. But the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;energy in that battery is coming from chemical reactions of the metals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not really from the potato.
<br>
<p>Also <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/lastword/answers/349gadgets.jsp?tp=gadgets1">http://www.newscientist.com/lastword/answers/349gadgets.jsp?tp=gadgets1</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy powering the potato clock does not come from the potato,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but simply from the electrochemical properties of two different metals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being placed into a salt solution. As the questioner correctly notes,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cola also works, as does any simple salt solution--try it with table
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;salt. The potato acts as a compact, slow-to-dry, salt bridge.
<br>
<p>The metal electrodes are slowly dissolved (or at least one of them is)
<br>
as part of the electrochemical reaction.  The power comes from the fact
<br>
that the different metals have different electrode potentials.  It is
<br>
not coming from the electrolyte.
<br>
