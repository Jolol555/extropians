Stop and look at what has happened, friends.  Look at what we were
<br>
saying about a year ago regarding the Taliban.  We went on at length
<br>
about what bastards they are, and how we need to overthrow them
<br>
with whatever means are at our disposal, even if we need to soil our
<br>
hands in order to do it.  Read in the archives where we speculated
<br>
there must be millions of Afghan intellectuals, gays, rebels, atheists, extropians, and plain old guys who will dance in the streets when the Taliban is crushed.
<br>
<p>We were right!  We were right all along.  The suffering of
<br>
the people under the Taliban has been unimaginable.  We may never
<br>
find out how bad it was, for those who suffered the most have no
<br>
voice, and indeed are most likely now dead, slain by the oppressors.

<p>YES!, I also remember the posts made a year ago about the horrors of the Taliban.  It is amazing to think about how the tables have turned in such a shocking way since than.  Somehow I feel it is a victory for the list in that we were tuned in on how things were there, and now feel even more connected to the liberation of the nation from Taliban oppression.        
<br>
<p>Now, just maybe we have some kind of special &quot;extropian mojo&quot; here!  And what we need to do is refocus it on some other oppressed group.  Should we use it on China?  
<br>
<p>Or if not, how about Utah!  It may have to be liberated from the Mormons before the winter olympics happen!  Right Greg? LOL!  Actually, I hear from Mormon friends that it has already been pretty well corrupted with R-rated movies, caffeinated drinks, and watered down alcohol.  But, the Mormons still hold fast in spite of that! ;) 
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John 
<br>
<p>P.S.  I had no idea there were millions of Extropian Afghans!  I will recognize them when I see a group shouting on the news, &quot;down with Jeremy Rifkin, the luddite devil!&quot;
