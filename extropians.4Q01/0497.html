<p>
I meant to post this earlier, but you know how life goes...
<br>
<p>I had an interesting interview on Thursday night with an intelligent chap
<br>
who is writing a thesis on the intersection spirituality and technology (and
<br>
spirituality and management, but the technology part was what he was after
<br>
with me -- basically spirituality in what are seen as the bastions of
<br>
secular activity).
<br>
<p>It was interesting that the interviewer agreed with most of my ideas
<br>
regarding the way in which technology/tool use is a progression on a single
<br>
line, all the way from wheels to restructuring your own mental processes via
<br>
nanotechnology. He also, gratifyingly, agreed with my view that the future
<br>
of humanity will be determined by the structure of our own myths. Our future
<br>
will look a lot like what our ancestors thought our past reality was.
<br>
<p>The interviewer also noted that none of the other people he'd intereviewed
<br>
to date (technopagans, other extropians, etc) took this view. Odd.
<br>
<p>So I thought I'd throw out a list of points for discussion as I recall them
<br>
from the interview to see what the other people on this list think.
<br>
<p>1) Animism
<br>
<p>Animism is the earliest form of religion. It stems from the human instinct
<br>
to model everything as if it were another human. My take on this is that, as
<br>
a child, the only way to learn to be human is to treat everything else as if
<br>
it were human until proven wrong. This trait persists into adulthood. In
<br>
primitive times, you can imagine people trying to understand any complex
<br>
system (tree, river, weather, etc) by acting as though it had a human
<br>
persona behind it. Coincidence and human nature being what it is, you can
<br>
actually build up a nice self-consistant delusional world this way where
<br>
it's hard to be proven wrong about what is controlling the river, weather,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>In modern humans, this trait persists. If you're not thinking about it,
<br>
you'll model something by assuming it's human. Go over your interactions
<br>
with complex inanimate objects (such as computers), especially when you're
<br>
angry. You'll see what I mean. Despite our rationality, we are still
<br>
programmed to default to treating anything complex as if it had a human
<br>
personality behind it. This becomes even more pronounced if we don't
<br>
understand how the thing works.
<br>
<p>2) There are no distinctions in technology
<br>
<p>People seem very eager to try and make a distinction between the technology
<br>
involved in wheels and the technology involved in writing code. I really
<br>
don't see any such distinction. Technology, in my view, is whatever makes it
<br>
easier for humans to shape the world.
<br>
<p>One could box prior technologies in to technologies of information (systems
<br>
of government, language, mathematics, etc) and technologies of matter
<br>
(wheels, etc), but I feel that this is a distinction that is vanishing and
<br>
thus irrelevant. The technologies of matter and information already blur and
<br>
overlap. And in any case, they are both simply subsets of the one definition
<br>
for technology I gave above.
<br>
<p>So the single line of development of technology is to make it easier and
<br>
easier for smaller and smaller groups of humans to accomplish greater and
<br>
greater changes. As our overall capacity increases, changes that were once
<br>
beyond the capability of our entire species become possible.
<br>
<p>3) We are programmed to like certain stories
<br>
<p>As has been shown by numerous authors, certain myths, stories and memes all
<br>
share underlying commonalities. These commonalities resonate with humans,
<br>
are attractive, have a power of fascination. We are drawn to them and we
<br>
create them.
<br>
<p>This is why the future will resemble the animistic past. We will try to
<br>
build a world that resonates with our preferences for memes, myths and
<br>
stories. We will build spirits (AIs), we will try to become immortal
<br>
(cryonics, any number of other potential technologies), we will attempt to
<br>
transcent, to become Gods, heroes, kamis (uploading, inloading, outloading,
<br>
etc).
<br>
<p>Yes, we will change our fundamental selves, but the initial builders of this
<br>
posthuman world will be humans. Before the spirits and Gods are let go to th
<br>
eir own devices, they will have been designed and built by humans and those
<br>
close to humans.
<br>
<p>So in essence, there is a sense of full circle. There is a sort of world
<br>
that we desire to live in, that we are built by our very nature to desire
<br>
living in. A world of awe, spirits, Gods, heroes and magic, a world in which
<br>
there *is* an intelligence behind every complex object. We will build that
<br>
world: we are building that world.
<br>
<p>4) Extropianism as mystery cult
<br>
<p>The comparison of cryonics and extropianism with religions came up. In my
<br>
mind, it all comes down to death and immortality. While animism may stem
<br>
from default programming of young humans (i.e. treat everything as if it
<br>
were human until proven otherwise), all more &quot;evolved&quot; religions stem from
<br>
the desire to answer the question of death, to assure personal immortality.
<br>
<p>Mystery cults (the Golden Bough is a good read on this topic) are a
<br>
subdivision of evolved religions with scriptures that tackle personal
<br>
immortality through the assurance some form of transcendence, or in other
<br>
words the changing of the self, becoming something greater than human.
<br>
Christianity in some of its forms -- and more often as presented in popular
<br>
culture -- retains fragments of many mystery cults in the fluid relationship
<br>
between angels and the souls of the dead.
<br>
<p>Extropianism sits in exactly the same bucket, insofar as satisfying basic
<br>
human desires go. We answer the question of death, and we offer the prospect
<br>
of transcendence. Like an early Christian mystery cult, these goals fit
<br>
within a larger framework (science in our case) and are bound up in a more
<br>
specific set of scriptures (the extropian principals).
<br>
<p>The only difference -- big difference, of course -- is that science will get
<br>
us to where we are going. Religions are just wishful thinking and
<br>
self-delusion.
<br>
<p>Of course, I could lead into a discussion on how to expand extropianism by
<br>
examining the success of various mystery cults (there are some good examples
<br>
in the last two centuries), but that's all for other people to look at if
<br>
they want. The question of whether or not your members understand what the
<br>
organization is actually about always comes up...I've always thought that in
<br>
order to be popularist, you have to sacrifice that concern. But that's a
<br>
whole other discussion.
<br>
<p>5) The need for awe
<br>
<p>Humans have a need for awe, for something percieved as far greater than they
<br>
are, something that touches them and speaks to them. This can be a God, the
<br>
knowledge of how the stars work, QCD, an appreciation of the true size of
<br>
the universe, etc, etc. It's another of those hardwired things in the human
<br>
brain, although I really don't have a good hypothesis for the existence this
<br>
one.
<br>
<p>An examination of my own thoughts and reactions shows that my astrophysical
<br>
training has left me lacking in need for religious (or other artificial)
<br>
sources of awe. Just thinking about the universe as it is understood today
<br>
is enough of a &quot;wow&quot; moment. I suspect that this is one of the reasons for
<br>
so many scientists being atheists. It can't just be astrophysics that
<br>
provides good sources of awe.
<br>
<p>A consideration of any one of the postulated post-human futures in all its
<br>
glory is pretty damn awe-inspiring too.
<br>
<p>---------
<br>
<p>Ok, enough. There were a bunch of other minor things, but those were the
<br>
high points. I just wanted to share :)
