<p>It depends what you mean by &quot;monitor&quot;.  Computers are cheap and
<br>
getting cheaper (IBM mainframe class computers don't cost $5
<br>
million anymore).  The required information on say 10-20 million
<br>
people would *easily* fit on a single hard drive.  We have the
<br>
technology to do data collection and mining inexpensively --
<br>
lets use it.
<br>
<p>The government scans my passport every time I enter the U.S.
<br>
so they must have a record of all of my entries.  The airlines
<br>
have a record of all of my exits.  Why can't this information
<br>
be tied together such that the border crossings can be matched?
<br>
(Particularly for non-U.S. citizens!)  VISAs are issued for
<br>
explicit periods and specific purposes.  I see no reason why
<br>
when people overstay VISAs red flags should not go off to
<br>
cause the start of an investigation.
<br>
<p>Foreign students could easily be monitored.  Every college
<br>
would be required to provide quarterly lists of the students
<br>
taking classes to the government.  Someone dropping off a
<br>
list who doesn't leave the country with a certain period
<br>
should be investigated to determine whether they represent
<br>
a threat.  The same could be done for people attending flight
<br>
schools, conferences, etc.  Its easy to employ a bank of telephone
<br>
operators in India who conduct the initial follow-ups for people who
<br>
have gone missing from their stated purpose of visiting the U.S.
<br>
Most of them will turn out to be nothing, but some will raise
<br>
red flags and be turned over to the INS or FBI.
<br>
<p>I think we are going to have to develop better methods for
<br>
determining when someone represents a threat and implement
<br>
them. When one moves to a world with nanotechnology, the rules
<br>
for what types of technology you will be able to import are
<br>
very likely to be enclave specific.  The burden is likely going
<br>
to have to be on the individual entering the enclave to prove that
<br>
they are not carrying dangerous technology.  I could easily
<br>
envision the development of enzymes that turn the CHON in
<br>
the human body into gasoline and TNT.  People in possession
<br>
of those enzymes don't get to visit my enclave.
