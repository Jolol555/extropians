<p>Health &amp; Science: Family freezes patriarch's body in hopes of eventual
<br>
revival

<p><p>By ANN CARNAHAN Scripps Howard News Service
<br>
<p><p>NEDERLAND, Colo. (December 31, 2001 1:17 p.m. EST) - It's 1:30 on a
<br>
Wednesday afternoon, and iceman Bo Shaffer is about to earn a couple hundred
<br>
bucks to pack 1,500 pounds of dry ice on the body of a dead man.
<br>
<p>&quot;This isn't a bad job,&quot; says Shaffer, an environmental consultant who comes
<br>
to this hillside every month to ice up the corpse.
<br>
<p>Shaffer unlocks the Tuff Shed door to reveal a tall wooden crate. Inside the
<br>
crate is an aluminum casket, home of Bredo Morstoel, who died in 1989.
<br>
Shaffer and an assistant remove the crate's lid and lift off a piece of blue
<br>
insulation.
<br>
<p>Lying atop the casket is a dime-store thermometer, which Shaffer picks up
<br>
and reads. &quot;Minus 75 degrees,&quot; he says, obviously pleased.
<br>
<p>Still frozen after all these years.
<br>
<p>More than 12 years after Bredo Morstoel died of heart failure in his native
<br>
Norway, his body is preserved in a backyard cryogenics lab overlooking the
<br>
Continental Divide.
<br>
<p>His grandson, Trygve Bauge, formerly of Nederland, hopes medical technology
<br>
will eventually be able to revive his grandfather or genetically recreate
<br>
him by copying the DNA in his cells.
<br>
<p>&quot;I applaud the company that recently had a breakthrough with cloning in the
<br>
U.S.,&quot; said Bauge by telephone from Oslo, where he now lives. &quot;So far,
<br>
they've been able to clone animals. The next step is to clone DNA from dead
<br>
animals.&quot;
<br>
<p>In Norway, Bauge organizes health retreats, where participants take ice
<br>
baths. A self-described entrepreneur, he hopes to launch &quot;various
<br>
life-extension centers&quot; that focus on health and cryogenics.
<br>
<p>Bauge was deported from the United States in 1994 after a seven-year fight
<br>
with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. He wires Shaffer $674 every
<br>
month to pay for the ice and labor.
<br>
<p>To date, it's cost $130,000 to keep Morstoel frozen.
<br>
<p>Some of the money came from Bauge's inheritance from his grandfather. Most
<br>
is paid by Aud Morstoel, who is Bredo's daughter and Bauge's mother. Aud
<br>
Morstoel, who lives with Bauge, was once head of Norway's largest pharmacy.
<br>
She vows to continue paying for the ice deliveries &quot;as long as it is
<br>
needed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Much of the $130,000 was spent soon after Morstoel died to fly his body from
<br>
Norway to a cryogenics facility in California, where it was initially stored
<br>
in liquid nitrogen. The body remained there until January 1994, when Bauge
<br>
brought it to Nederland.
<br>
<p>Bauge, 44, stored the remains at his unfinished home in Nederland along with
<br>
the body of Al Campbell, a Chicago man.
<br>
<p>Soon after, exasperated town leaders tried to force Bauge to remove the
<br>
bodies, but it was determined there was no health hazard and Bauge
<br>
prevailed.
<br>
<p>But Campbell's friend got &quot;cold feet&quot; and decided to bring Campbell's body
<br>
back to Chicago, Bauge said. &quot;I think he was thawed out and buried
<br>
regularly,&quot; Bauge says.
<br>
<p>Scientists have long been skeptical that Morstoel could be revived.
<br>
Morstoel's body was left putrefying at room temperature for 72 hours after
<br>
his death because Norway has a law against freezing newly dead bodies. That
<br>
resulted in the death of cells. Also, the dry ice surrounding Morstoel's
<br>
body is primitive compared to the techniques used by established cryogenics
<br>
facilities.
<br>
<p>Morstoel was set to be cremated after he died, but Bauge intervened. Bauge
<br>
said he never asked his grandfather whether he wanted to be frozen.
<br>
<p>&quot;I never had a chance to ask him,&quot; Bauge said. &quot;I didn't expect him to die.
<br>
It came as a surprise.&quot;
<br>
<p>Morstoel was 89 when he died in his sleep. He had been to Colorado twice
<br>
before it became his final, or nearly final, resting place.
<br>
<p>Every month, Shaffer packs in the new ice. He keeps a bottle of Old Granddad
<br>
on a shelf in the Tuff Shed. Some months, he takes a swig in honor of
<br>
Morstoel.
<br>
<p>The casket is wrapped in chains so &quot;he can't get out,&quot; Shaffer jokes.
<br>
<p>Every month, Shaffer e-mails Bauge. He tells him the amount of ice he packed
<br>
on and whether the shed needs any repairs.
<br>
<p>And eight time zones away, Bauge vows to continue his grandfather's
<br>
preservation.
<br>
<p>&quot;Lots of religious groups say, 'Come follow me and you'll have eternal
<br>
life,'&quot; Bauge says. &quot;They end up as rotten corpses in the graveyard. They
<br>
are deceived.&quot;
