The mind of a killer

<br>
A neurologist who studies murderers' brains talks about factors that make
<br>
someone kill, the difficulty of predicting violence and why most murderers can
<br>
never be rehabilitated.
<br>
<p>July 27, 2001 | In the past 25 years, Jonathan Pincus, chief of neurology at
<br>
the Veterans Administration Hospital in Washington and a professor at
<br>
Georgetown University School of Medicine, has sat across the room from 150
<br>
murderers. He has questioned them about their childhood, administered I.Q.
<br>
tests and performed neurological examinations. Pincus met with 15-year-old Kip
<br>
Kinkel after he killed his parents and opened fire on a school in Springfield,
<br>
Ore. He spent hours with Russell Weston, the man who shot two guards inside
<br>
the U.S. Capitol. And he interviewed a charming white-collar professional
<br>
named Ted Bundy after he mutilated and murdered as many as 50 women.
<br>
<p>All of these people, young and old, white and minority, middle class and poor,
<br>
shared a handful of characteristics that, in Pincus' estimation, transformed
<br>
them from average citizens to coldblooded killers. In &quot;Base Instincts: What
<br>
Makes Killers Kill,&quot; Pincus presents his research -- much of which deals with
<br>
scientific information about the frontal lobes of the brain -- in a nimble,
<br>
absorbing and highly entertaining way. (His stories will have you checking the
<br>
lock on your front door several times before you turn out the lights.)
<br>
Although Pincus does not treat his subjects sympathetically, he also knows
<br>
that to cast them off as evil, morally debased monsters limits our
<br>
understanding of the ingredients that somehow get thrown together to create a
<br>
killer.
<br>
<p>According to your book, three things intersect to create a killer: mental
<br>
illness, neurological damage and child abuse. Are all three always there?
<br>
<p>Two-thirds of murderers have all three factors, and the others have two of the
<br>
three. It's pretty clear that mental illness is not enough to cause violence
<br>
because most people who are mentally ill are not violent. It's also evident
<br>
that neurological damage is not enough to cause violence because the vast
<br>
majority of people who are neurologically impaired are not violent. And it's
<br>
clear that the experience of horrendous child abuse is not enough to cause
<br>
violence because most people who are abused that way are not violent. Yet,
<br>
most violent people have these three factors, or two of the three. That's an
<br>
indisputable fact.
<br>
<p>The theory that explains it is that abuse sets up an impulse toward violence
<br>
that a good brain can control. If you get the abuse and the neurological
<br>
damage and mental illness, then violent impulses are not easy to check. That's
<br>
why they are expressed under stress or at times of jealousy or anger.
<br>
<p>Have other doctors, sociologists or psychiatrists pinpointed similar causes?
<br>
<p>When people have looked, they have found similar causes. You have to do a very
<br>
thorough study. It takes me three to four hours with somebody -- that's the
<br>
time I spend with the individual, examining him, questioning him and talking
<br>
to him -- and it takes a psychiatrist at least double that time. And that
<br>
doesn't count the review of medical, police and school records that are also
<br>
available for examination.
<br>
<p>How do you determine that a person is neurologically impaired?
<br>
<p>There are many neuropsychological tests, just as there are many kinds of blood
<br>
tests. I do a number of tests of cortical function -- the cortex is the part
<br>
of the brain that you think with -- and most of my tests measure motor and
<br>
sensory function. For example, I have the patient follow my horizontally
<br>
moving finger with his eyes to see if his visual tracking is smooth. If it's
<br>
not smooth, it indicates that the frontal eye fields are not working properly.
<br>
<p>What about an I.Q. test?
<br>
<p>People don't realize that an I.Q. test is not a test of all the parts of the
<br>
brain. It's a pretty good screening tool for the back parts of the brain, but
<br>
not a very good one for the front of the brain. That's the place where most of
<br>
the neurological deficits in murderers reside -- in the frontal lobe.
<br>
<p>Were most of these people born with this neurological damage, or did their
<br>
environment contribute to it?
<br>
<p>It's very difficult to say in most cases. In some of them, where there is a
<br>
history of maternal drinking and drug use and there are physical
<br>
characteristics associated with the fetal alcohol effect, it's reasonable to
<br>
think that the child was born with it. If someone's head circumference is more
<br>
than two standard deviations below the mean, then you can assume that this
<br>
damage occurred, if not prenatally, then shortly after birth.
<br>
<p>But most of the time there are many factors that could have played a role in
<br>
the neurological dysfunction, for example, head injury -- the experience of
<br>
being physically abused by being beaten in the head. And then there are
<br>
automobile accidents, a history of meningitis, a history of encephalitis, a
<br>
history of unconsciousness, seizures, epilepsy and drug use. It's very hard to
<br>
know which of those factors was the most important one in damaging the brain,
<br>
which part of the brain it damaged and when that damage was sustained.
<br>
<p>The Making of A Pedophile
<br>
<a href="http://salon.com/books/int/2001/07/27/killers/index1.html">http://salon.com/books/int/2001/07/27/killers/index1.html</a>
<br>
You give the example of Lewis Culpepper, who sexually abused a 5-year-old
<br>
girl. You explain that the brain damage that made him able to do that was
<br>
caused by a car accident.
<br>
<p>He was sexually abused for the first 15 years of his life; then he lived 15
<br>
years as a relatively good citizen, held a stable job as a mechanic and
<br>
married a woman who had been previously married and had a child. She
<br>
considered him to be a good husband. He was a responsible father. But all that
<br>
time he was having fantasies of a pedophilic nature, which he never acted on.
<br>
Then he was involved in this automobile accident where his frontal lobes were
<br>
destroyed. He seemed to be completely normal, was discharged from the hospital
<br>
and was recuperating at home. Shortly after, he began to have a sexual
<br>
relationship with his 5-year-old girl [his stepdaughter]. That continued for a
<br>
year until her mother found out. It seemed so clear in that case that the
<br>
destruction of his frontal lobes had destroyed his capacity to check those
<br>
pedophilic fantasies and to realize that there were consequences to acting on
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>He didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with what he did?
<br>
<p>Right, he thought that the whole thing was exaggerated, and even the personal
<br>
consequences, such as, say, being killed in prison for being a pedophile --
<br>
that's something that happens in prisons -- didn't seem to bother him.
<br>
<p>Were most of the people whom you spoke to this way as well -- not seeing what
<br>
was wrong with what they did or comprehending the consequences?
<br>
<p>Many.
<br>
<p>Did they express remorse?
<br>
<p>Very rarely. In order to express remorse, you have to feel it. The feelings of
<br>
people who have had frontal lobe injuries are one of the things that are
<br>
affected. You can get somebody who knows something is wrong, but doesn't feel
<br>
that it's wrong.
<br>
<p>What's the difference?
<br>
<p>Here's a morally neutral example: I have a patient who's a physician. He had
<br>
had a frontal lobe brain tumor that was removed, with consequent severe damage
<br>
to both frontal lobes, but you wouldn't know that there was anything wrong
<br>
with him -- until you talked with him for a little while. He had two or three
<br>
automobile accidents that were essentially identical. He would be driving
<br>
along in a lane that was blocked off on the highway. He saw the barrier but he
<br>
could not stop the car or change lanes. He would drive right into the barrier
<br>
at 60 miles an hour. Fortunately, no one was hurt.
<br>
<p>Now, you could ask, Did he not know that two things cannot occupy the same
<br>
place at the same time? Of course he knew that. Did he have an accident every
<br>
time he drove a car? No. Did he change lanes at other times? Yes. Well, why
<br>
didn't he change lanes under these circumstances? You could suggest that there
<br>
must be something wrong with him morally. Obviously, that's not true. The same
<br>
thing is true of people who have frontal injuries and do terrible things to
<br>
other people.
<br>
<p>This brings up the question that your book addresses, and I want to ask it
<br>
directly: Where do morality and ethics reside in the brain?
<br>
<p>The only honest answer to that is that I don't know. But I do know that
<br>
morality and ethics are expressed through the brain. And if there's something
<br>
wrong with the brain, there could very well be something wrong with the
<br>
expression of morality and ethics. If a composer wishes to let an audience
<br>
know what is in his mind, he must have a symphony orchestra. And if the
<br>
symphony orchestra plays well, and it's terrible music, then there's clearly
<br>
something wrong with the composer. But if he wrote something and, after a
<br>
terrible performance, an investigation reveals that the symphony orchestra was
<br>
performing on broken instruments, then that must have had something to do with
<br>
the poor performance. It doesn't get the composer off the hook, but if there
<br>
are broken instruments in the orchestra, it's not fair to judge the adequacy
<br>
of the composer.
<br>
<p>Do you feel the same way about free will?
<br>
<p>Free will, let's say, resides in some recondite place, but it's expressed
<br>
through the working of the frontal lobes. If there's something demonstrably
<br>
wrong with that system, and the behavior could be explained by such a lesion,
<br>
then I think it should be considered mitigating at least, if not exculpatory.
<br>
<p>Do you apply the same composer/orchestra metaphor to the question of someone's
<br>
being evil? I wonder what it was like for you sitting in a room, across from
<br>
some pretty horrible people, and trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.
<br>
Did you ever reflexively think, OK, this man or woman is just evil and that's
<br>
it?
<br>
<p>There have been very few criminals whom I've seen who have not acted in a
<br>
totally unacceptable and evil manner. There have been very, very few who I
<br>
thought should not be punished for what they did. To the extent that a person
<br>
has exercised free will -- and very few people are turned into automatons by
<br>
this combination of abuse, mental illness and neurological deficit -- they
<br>
should be punished, and punished severely. But if these factors, which are not
<br>
under their control, are operative and may have influenced their actions, then
<br>
they should be mitigating.
<br>
<p>If murderers have defective brains, can the death penalty be justified?
<br>
<a href="http://salon.com/books/int/2001/07/27/killers/index2.html">http://salon.com/books/int/2001/07/27/killers/index2.html</a>
<br>
<p>So what does your work lead you to think about the punishment for murderers?
<br>
<p>The issue I'm really facing is: Should this person be executed or given life
<br>
imprisonment without possibility of parole? I think the latter. I am not one
<br>
of those people who believe that life imprisonment is somehow the same as
<br>
getting off and being free. The conditions in prison are far from plush. It's
<br>
not a country club. Just the idea of not being free is a terrible, terrible
<br>
deprivation.
<br>
<p>Has your research gotten many killers off death row?
<br>
<p>I have been moderately successful in that way. Two killers whom I've examined
<br>
have been executed.
<br>
<p>Do people call on you to make judgments of guilt or innocence -- to examine
<br>
people who have been accused of violent crimes?
<br>
<p>Everyone I've seen has been guilty.
<br>
<p>Would it be possible for you to make accurate predictions about whether
<br>
someone is likely to become a murderer?
<br>
<p>There was a guy named Joel Rifkin who killed 16 prostitutes in New York. He
<br>
killed the first one when he was 32. He's in some upstate prison now. If I had
<br>
seen him before he was 32, I would have said, &quot;Here's a guy who goes to
<br>
prostitutes a lot, has neurological damage and was abused as a child, and he
<br>
has some pretty weird fantasies, but he's never been violent.&quot; He had been
<br>
thinking about killing people for quite some time, and most serial murderers
<br>
do that. But it would have been very difficult to predict his behavior because
<br>
not everybody who has all three of these things is violent. And not everybody
<br>
who is violent is violent all the time.
<br>
<p>Have your feelings toward the death penalty evolved over the period that
<br>
you've been doing your research?
<br>
<p>Yes and no. I am not a principled opponent of the death penalty. I believe
<br>
that it might be appropriate in certain circumstances, but I think that it
<br>
should be used rarely and for the most horrendous of crimes -- such as Adolf
<br>
Eichmann. Or even Timothy McVeigh.
<br>
<p>Did you examine Timothy McVeigh?
<br>
<p>I did not evaluate him, but I was asked by one of the defense attorneys if I
<br>
would be willing to, and I said, yes, I would. I wasn't asked because McVeigh
<br>
wouldn't permit that type of a defense -- a diminished-capacity defense. He
<br>
preferred to be executed as the embodiment of evil, rather than have someone
<br>
say that he was a sick, weak character, which is probably what he was.
<br>
<p>Does your theory of what makes a murderer seem to apply to him?
<br>
<p>All I know about McVeigh is what I've read in the newspapers. He was
<br>
paranoid -- he thought that the government was against the people and against
<br>
him. He was also grandiose -- he believed that he was specially endowed and
<br>
was going to be the Rambo to take on the government of the United States.
<br>
Blowing up public buildings was his Sylvester Stallone-like posture. There was
<br>
something seriously wrong with him mentally.
<br>
<p>Although there was no history of abuse reported, I got vibes that his family
<br>
didn't have a close relationship: He didn't want them to be in the prison at
<br>
the time of his death, and there was very little contact during the trial. Why
<br>
was that? Where did all of this hatred of authority come from? My guess is
<br>
that he was abused.
<br>
<p>But he killed 168 people, and for a crime like that, maybe the death penalty
<br>
is justified.
<br>
<p>We're talking about people who hate. What about the killers of Matthew
<br>
Shepard?
<br>
<p>I did examine Aaron McKinney, one of the killers. He satisfied the criteria.
<br>
Who commits crimes of hatred? Who wants to hate people like that? It doesn't
<br>
just spring into someone's mind to hate this or that group. Those things are
<br>
programmed by experience. People have various reasons for hating groups.
<br>
There's always some group available to hate, and it's the people who have been
<br>
abused who displace their anger onto a particular group. There's an example in
<br>
the chapter titled &quot;Hitler and Hatred&quot; of a young man who hated women.
<br>
<p>So you think this applies to Hitler as well?
<br>
<p>I'm almost positive it does. There were two or three paragraphs in &quot;Mein
<br>
Kampf&quot; in which he seemed to indicate that he came from an extremely abusive
<br>
home, and there was independent evidence of that. A guy by the name of
<br>
[Walter] Langer was commissioned by the OSS, the predecessor of the CIA, to do
<br>
an in-depth psychological study of Hitler. He had primary sources of
<br>
information -- Hitler had a half-brother who was a petty criminal. The story
<br>
was that Hitler had been left for dead once after a particularly bad beating.
<br>
His father was a drunk who would come home and beat up the family. In &quot;Mein
<br>
Kampf,&quot; he even hints that he experienced sexual abuse.
<br>
<p>That explanation is kind of hard to swallow because Hitler seems so different
<br>
from, say, the young man in your book who impulsively killed the convenience
<br>
store cashier.
<br>
<p>Remember, Hitler probably was not brain-damaged and was probably very bright.
<br>
But he was also manic-depressive and filled with anger at a variety of things.
<br>
<p>The man who held up a convenience store in Modesto, Calif., who shot and
<br>
killed the proprietor and forgot to steal anything, was functioning with an
<br>
I.Q. of about 70. Instead of having mental illness, as Hitler did, he was
<br>
neurologically impaired. But they both had been horrendously abused.
<br>
<p>By &quot;abuse,&quot; you're usually talking about really disgusting abuse. Some of your
<br>
passages describing child abuse are more horrifying than the murders.
<br>
<p>This guy in Modesto had been raised in a home where he had impetigo at age 2.
<br>
The neighbors described how cockroaches covered his body and there were so
<br>
many cockroaches in his house that you couldn't see the color that the wall
<br>
was painted. The kid was starving and he used to eat lead paint.
<br>
<p>What made Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer kill
<br>
<a href="http://salon.com/books/int/2001/07/27/killers/index3.html">http://salon.com/books/int/2001/07/27/killers/index3.html</a>
<br>
<p>What about Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy? What did you find in them?
<br>
<p>I only examined Bundy. His neurological examination was normal, but he had
<br>
symptoms that suggested manic-depressive illness and a history that was
<br>
strongly suggestive of grotesque sexual abuse. I did speak to Dahmer's mother
<br>
in a confidential phone conversation, and sexual abuse was suggested by some
<br>
of the things she said to me.
<br>
<p>How would you assess Andrea Yates?
<br>
<p>Postpartum depression is usually seen as part of bipolar disorder, so there
<br>
was the mental illness part of it. What went on in her own home when she was a
<br>
little girl, I don't know. But Susan Smith, who drowned her two children, was
<br>
sexually and physically abused as a child. And she was depressed at the time
<br>
that she did that.
<br>
<p>I noticed that the father of one of the murderers in your book was a
<br>
fundamentalist minister. Does being raised in a very strict religious
<br>
environment have any effect on potential murderers?
<br>
<p>Actually, I didn't study religion, but I did find murderers who came from
<br>
strict religious backgrounds. Of course, what passed for religion in their
<br>
homes is hypocritical. There was the serial killer whose father was a
<br>
fundamentalist minister and subjected the family to frequent biblical
<br>
exegesis. He was very inconsistent in his own behavior and what he tolerated.
<br>
He was extremely perverted, he and his wife both, with the children. The abuse
<br>
included ritualized beatings, which he found sexually stimulating. Most of the
<br>
children did not turn out to be antisocial, but one became a serial murderer
<br>
and used to amputate the feet of prostitutes. That could be traced to the way
<br>
his mother used to deal with him in a sexual way.
<br>
<p>It seems mysterious that people suddenly become violent killers after years of
<br>
a seemingly normal life. For some of them, it takes 30 years to become
<br>
violent, while others are killers at age 12.
<br>
<p>It's during periods of mania, when a killer feels released from the
<br>
constraints of society, and during periods of depression, when he's feeling
<br>
victimized again, that he's likely to be a perpetrator. A lot of serial
<br>
killers do all of what they do within a little space of time; then there's a
<br>
period of calm and they do it again.
<br>
<p>What about groups like the Mafia? It seems like Mafia men don't have much in
<br>
common with Kip Kinkel or Ted Bundy.
<br>
<p>Everything that we know about the Mafia is anecdotal. But I would imagine that
<br>
the hit men have come from abusive families. The issue is whether they are
<br>
neurologically impaired, and I suspect that they are. But it's possible that
<br>
these people may have grown up in a world where they weren't asked to control
<br>
their violent impulses, or where violent behavior was accepted.
<br>
<p>In his book about Nazi Germany, &quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners,&quot; Daniel Jonah
<br>
Goldhagen estimated that up to half a million German civilians might have
<br>
actually killed people. That's an enormous number, but there were 60 million
<br>
people in Germany at that time. It's still a small minority. Were they all
<br>
brain-damaged and mentally ill? I doubt it. But I bet that all of them were
<br>
abused in some way as children. Then the government tells them that if they
<br>
kill a member of a certain group, it will be good for the country.
<br>
<p>Is there a difference between the architects of murders and the people who
<br>
actually pull the trigger?
<br>
<p>That's a good question. I don't know. I've only examined two hit men and they
<br>
both had all three factors. Psychiatrist Dorothy Lewis examined a death row
<br>
executioner and he was quite like the people he executed.
<br>
<p>The executioner displayed the same characteristics that murderers do?
<br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>What about the people who murdered but who didn't seem to have all three of
<br>
these characteristics -- how do you explain them?
<br>
<p>There was one boy, for example, who was 15 when he stabbed his next-door
<br>
neighbor to death. He had been adopted in the first year of his life. His
<br>
adoptive parents, from everything that I could learn about them, were not
<br>
abusive. They were decent, fine people. But the boy was psychotic and had been
<br>
brain-damaged. He was born to a heroin addict who had manic-depressive
<br>
illness. He had two of the three factors. He thought that his neighbor was
<br>
spying on him. It was a delusional belief and he couldn't check the impulse to
<br>
kill. In this case, one of the few such cases, I actually think the media
<br>
played a role, because he used to watch &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; again
<br>
and again and again. I think that set up the paradigm for doing what he did.
<br>
<p>So watching violence can affect young people?
<br>
<p>That's rare. Actually, more than a few people I saw had been fascinated by
<br>
violence or had seen the same violent video again and again. That did form the
<br>
template for what they did. But the real horror in their lives was not coming
<br>
from the videos, it was coming from their homes.
<br>
<p>You also talk about the hallmarks of abuse -- cruelty to animals, fire
<br>
setting, bedwetting. Do people use these things as predictors?
<br>
<p>They use them as predictors of violence. That's been known for some time. What
<br>
hasn't been known is that they are indicators of abuse. You show me a kid
<br>
who's set fire to his bed or his parents' bed and I'll show you a kid who's
<br>
been sexually abused. With cruelty to animals -- things like setting a cat on
<br>
fire, really awful things -- he's trying to enact what's happened to him on
<br>
something weaker than him.
<br>
<p>Do groups or organizations exist that are trying to determine whether certain
<br>
children may end up violent later in life?
<br>
<p>There are some, but not enough. One of the shining examples of what the
<br>
government can do is in Hawaii. The organization, Healthy Start, targets women
<br>
who are about to give birth and are likely to be abusive on the basis of
<br>
certain criteria -- unstable housing, inadequate education, no immediate
<br>
family contacts, a history of substance abuse, a history of psychiatric care,
<br>
depression. It offers a woman the services of a trained person who goes into
<br>
the home and helps with applying for welfare and housing, making contacts at
<br>
medical clinics and teaching her how to be a mother. Some people are just
<br>
ignorant about that, probably because they've never seen good parenting
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>If society targeted child abuse, you'd get rid of a lot more than just
<br>
violence.
<br>
<p>Can violent murderers be rehabilitated?
<br>
<p>I don't think so. To the extent that their mental illness can be treated and
<br>
their neurological illness can be treated, they might have a lower potential
<br>
for violence, but never a zero potential for violence. I don't believe in a
<br>
medical -- as opposed to a criminal -- approach to corrections where violence
<br>
is concerned. I'm not against treatment, but it should be done in a
<br>
correctional facility. I would never want someone out on the streets just
<br>
because he was under treatment.
