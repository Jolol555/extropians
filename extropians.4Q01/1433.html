<p>I love the Libertarian philosophy because I love life, and the latter
<br>
is my first and truer love. If Libertarianism ever conflicts with my
<br>
love of life, Libertarianism will be told to pack its crap and get the
<br>
hell out of my headspace.
<br>
<p>That being said, Bush, YOU GAVE THE TALIBASTARDS A PILE OF MONEY FOR
<br>
&quot;ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS&quot; JUST A MONTH OR TWO BEFORE THE ATTACKS, WHAT'S
<br>
WRONG WITH YOU?  AND NOW YOU'RE GIVING ALL KINDS OF SHADY REGIMES ALL
<br>
KINDS OF MILITARY AND POLITICAL CONCESSIONS THAT WILL COME BACK TO
<br>
HAUNT US IN THE NEXT WAR JUST SO THEY'LL GIVE US THEIR AMBIVALENT
<br>
SUPPORT IN THIS ONE.
<br>
<p>Too bad that we cannot sue you and other elected officials for loss of
<br>
income, loss of limb, and loss of family members. Otherwise, I think
<br>
you'd err on the side of caution in deciding how (and whether) to
<br>
spend our tax money.
<br>
<p>Speaking of which, I must give credit where it's due and thank you for
<br>
the $300 check. It won't buy my vote, though. My vote is currently worth
<br>
ten times that amount.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, I guess I'm stuck with you, and will grudgingly abide by
<br>
all except the most fascist and irrational policies you push through,
<br>
in the hopes that doing so will protect America and what remains of
<br>
our democracy... so that during the next presidential election I can
<br>
yet again exercise my right to vote against you and your Democrat
<br>
'opponents'.

<br>
