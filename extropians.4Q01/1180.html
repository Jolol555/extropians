<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Ahemmm!  I think I will speak to this question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I believe that I am a 12th generation American citizen (those on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the list who can trump that (native Americans excepted) please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;feel free to do so).  Rafal, would I believe, be considered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;0th generation American.  Yet I find myself siding more with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Rafal than with Randy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This issue has NOTHING to do with genealogy! It has to do with long term 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future of this country, and the short term future of our wallets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As for myself, I have American ancestors going back to ~ 12000 BP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And, as someone else pointed out, West European genes have been found in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very very old Americans, and they probably were here in America around 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;20000 BP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Actually, someone said that there were caucasians here before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;present 'natives' arrived ~9000 years ago. Caucasians are not western
</em><br>
<em>&gt;european in origin, they originate from the Altai/Caucasus/Baikal region
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of central asia, and only migrated west (and east to NA, it seems) due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to pressure from a mongoloid expansion from China and SE asia. Said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;North American caucasians had more in common with the aboriginal Ainu
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people of the Japanese island of Hokkaido than with those that wound up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Scandinavia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>That is not what the evidence says:  Haplotype X is found only in *England* 
<br>
these days. No trace of it anywhere else--except in Amerinds!
<br>
So therefore it is extremely unlikely that Haplotype X migrated east from 
<br>
anywhere.  It almost certainly migrated west from Western Europe, probably 
<br>
via boat.
<br>
<p>Also, there is the excellent Solutrean evidence, a la the (1) Clovis points, 
<br>
and (2) the red ochre caches, and at least several other very close 
<br>
similarities.  Dissenters say there is no evidence that Solutreans had 
<br>
boats.  Well, none that we have found, anyway. But other cultures had boats 
<br>
before that time, and those cultures were arguably less advanced than the 
<br>
Solutreans, in several known aspects, etc. It's all on the Net.  Well known 
<br>
and well published distinguished academics created this theory....
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;The &quot;Extropian Game&quot; is *NOT* &quot;horde the wealth&quot;.  The Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Game is to spin the wheel and promote complexification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Extropy game is *supposed* to be about keeping our precious brain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter from the ravages of Entropy....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Live free or die, death is not the worst of evils&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Your ar wrong.  Death is the paramount evil. All else is religion, of some 
<br>
form....
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While living forever is an extropic ethic, it is not only not the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethic, it is not necessarily the highest one. Individual liberty and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self determination / self improvement are the higher individual extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethics. Living forever is merely one option an individual extropian may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Randy's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;points are ill-suited for the Extropian list unless he makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;clear and falsifiable arugment that the admission of &quot;educated&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;immigrants over &quot;uneducated&quot; immigrants will clearly promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;a greater rate of complexification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When you cross the street and see a bus bearing down on you, do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;postpone running until an &quot;clear and falsifiable argument&quot; is presented 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the bus will run you down unless you hustle your butt to the sidewalk?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not quite the right analogy. More like: When you see a bus run down one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of your associates in the streets, and the driver says &quot;You are next!&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do you postpone running/shooting out the wheels/EMPing the engine until
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you have a clear, falsifiable, and independently verifiable argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the driver actually meant to do what he did and really means to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the same to you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The above analogy applies more to the present terrorist situation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though. On immigration in general, it is more a matter of a ship at sea,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rescuing people who are abandoning sinking ships. You could rescue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everybody, but that would capsize your own ship and then nobody would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have anyplace to turn. Each individual floating in the sea obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinks it is perfectly reasonable and fair that the ship can surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accomodate just one more person (them, of course) and that they don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean any harm to anybody.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, while you are floating around rescuing people, you have the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already on board furiously working to build the hull to have larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;displacement capacity, larger water processing capacity, and more food,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decking, cabin space, etc. You obviously want to keep the rate of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;construction ahead of the rate of rescuing, so you don't fall behind and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to start functioning on a more scarce economy for each individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The problem is that some of the people you are rescuing are coming from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ships that sank because those people either neglected the maintenance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their ship, were unable to do so, or had a hand in its destruction, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when they arrive on board your ship, they either contribute nothing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the expansion of your ship's capacity while soaking up resources, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they contribute less than they consume, or they take an active role in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destroying the capacity of the ship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How do you determine who is going to be a positive contributing member
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the crew and who is going to be a detriment? Do you just let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everybody on board and hope for the best, or do you impose filters that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;try to determine how each individual is going to behave and check on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actions of those new crewmembers until you are satisfied they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positive contributors, while deporting those who don't fit your filters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and those who turn out to have misrepresented themselves?
</em><br>
<p><p>They will  call you cruel or cold, but we all do this every day, in so very 
<br>
many aspects of life.  They need to be real.  The fact is that the 
<br>
immigration &quot;debate&quot; has been so propagandized that when it comes to this 
<br>
issue, that almost all Americans, and many citizens of other western 
<br>
democracies, cannot find their logical ass with both hands.
