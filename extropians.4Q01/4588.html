<em>&gt; |One example you bring up, Samantha is the presence of American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |troops in Saudi Arabia causing Muslim hatred towards us, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |Mohammed said on his deathbed to never allow the infidel there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; KPJ wrote: Cannot U.S. muster enough Moslem (non-&quot;infidel&quot;) troops?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Are you Moslem? Become a member of U.S. forces and see Saudi-Arabia!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Cool, good lateral thinking KPJ!  Actually I think we already
<br>
have a number of Muslims in US uniform.  I heard in WW2,
<br>
they would ask every soldier his faith.  The only choices were
<br>
Catholic, Protestant or Jewish.  If one said atheist he was told:
<br>
Son there aint no atheists in foxholes, now pick one.
<br>
<p>Dont know if that story is true, but I did hear they now have
<br>
other categories, presumably Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, etc.
<br>
Anyone know?  Mike, did they ask?
<br>
<p>Regarding the notion of ridding the Muslim holy land of all
<br>
infidels, however, I would urge those who desire such a
<br>
thing to immediately build a high wall around the entire
<br>
region they consider sacred, like the Vatican and
<br>
the Chinese Forbidden City.  Then if any infidel owns
<br>
property in that area, she would need to be bought out
<br>
at fair market value.  Part of the reason the US has
<br>
troops in Saudi is to protect American property there.  We
<br>
have a lot of it, legitimately purchased.
<br>
<p>Then, seems to me they could set aside reservations within
<br>
the walled sacred nation for the infidel to live, should she have
<br>
legitimate business interests there.  These reservations would
<br>
have their own separate legal and financial infrastructure.  All
<br>
the rules of international business would apply there, such as
<br>
investing money for profit, etc.  These reservations would
<br>
be placed on otherwise worthless property, utterly devoid
<br>
of natural resources.  They would serve as sanctuaries of
<br>
sorts, for those who are born in the sacred lands but for
<br>
whatever reason, find themselves unable to believe, or
<br>
who convert to other faiths, etc.  The government of
<br>
the reservation would be minimal, with every possible
<br>
freedom granted, and little if any welfare offered.
<br>
<p>With such a system we would see if the middle east
<br>
fails to prosper because Israel is somehow robbing
<br>
all its neighbors.  Or alternately we might see that the
<br>
reservations are wildly prosperous, the people well
<br>
educated, busy and happy.
<br>
<p>Of course, then they would need to be destroyed
<br>
and plundered, but you see the point of my flight of
<br>
fancy.  spike
