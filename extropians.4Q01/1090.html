<em>&gt; Well, well, I have truly struck the motherlode of openminded,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You guys talk about memes and starting new ones, but a very big part of what

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you regurgitating propaganda, but 50 year old propaganda.
</em><br>
<p>Please. This propoganda I'm regurgitating is severalfold older than a
<br>
mere 50 years. It's the propoganda that inspired the founding of our
<br>
great nation-state, and when all nation states crumble to make way for
<br>
glorious anarchotopia, this propoganda will continue to inspire just
<br>
as surely as trolls will continue to troll and there will continue to
<br>
be those who feed them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am sad to say that you and many of your list-mates here really don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and analyze on your own, but just follow a program. You think as you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told, in large part.
</em><br>
<p>I don't speak for others, but I did analyze what you posted, probably
<br>
more so than it merited. You started with a nonsequitur singling out
<br>
mass media as being responsible for waves of immigration. You followed
<br>
it up with a bizzare metaphor about houses. Nowhere did you attempt to
<br>
make clear exactly what adverse impact immigration has had on you or
<br>
on the US in general.
<br>
<p>I am absolutely serious when I accuse you of being a communist. You
<br>
might think that just because you're a xenophobe, your anticommunist
<br>
credentials are above reproach, but communists can be as xenophobic as
<br>
anybody else.  They're just not as up front about their xenophobia as
<br>
you are, and hats off to you on that. Now then, communism is at its
<br>
core a belief that the state can and should control markets for the
<br>
public good (as defined by the state).  You, Comrade Randy, believe
<br>
the state should control labor markets through protectionist
<br>
measures. I believe the state should control as few institutions as
<br>
possible, perhaps none at all. Therefore in my frame of reference you
<br>
are a commie traitor and I am hereby referring your case to the
<br>
Committee on Unextropian Activities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh well, at least this list is *nominally* in favor in immortality, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find it hard to believe that a practical immortalist would espouse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spending money on a space program....
</em><br>
<p>What are you doing for immortality? How will trolling about immigrants
<br>
help acchieve immortality? Hypothetically, if you found out that a
<br>
number of research scientists in fields relevant to your area of concern
<br>
were naturalized citizens or foreign nationals on work visas, would you
<br>
want them all to leave?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may now resume the tribal chatter, etc....
</em><br>
<p>Ook ook.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or maybe you would rather stone me in the village square?
</em><br>
<p>No way, man, I don't think we can increase your level of stonedness.
<br>
I think maybe instead I'll start keeping an eye out for a foreigner
<br>
I can convince to marry your sister.
