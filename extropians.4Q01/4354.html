</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. It would be a smart move if *every* educator, at least, learned
<br>
a bit more about this range, and took it into account. I frequently rant on
<br>
about my own, um, cognitive anomaly (or variant), but here I go again:
<br>
<p>I was regarded as a real dope at school, and when I was 12 got shifted out
<br>
of an `academic' Jesuit school to a crappy `technical school' (woodwork,
<br>
rudimentary machine shop, etc), where I proved even less competent. I
<br>
suspect that I might be the only PhD ever to emerge from its dark Satanic
<br>
mills... :)
<br>
<p>The key to this weird misdiagnosis of stupidity is likely to be my
<br>
inability to form mental visual images. I can eventually get most places
<br>
others can reach, but I have to do it by clawing up the walls with my
<br>
fingernails (speaking of fingers). (Yet I *dream* in full color images.) 
<br>
<p>The epiphany that set me free happened at the end of my first year at
<br>
university, when I abruptly grokked that when tutors and lecturers and text
<br>
books kept going on about `poetic images' they *meant* it... at least
<br>
sometimes. The everyday experience of perceptual hallucinations stood at
<br>
the ground level of the metaphor. *Fuck, people SEE things in their
<br>
HEADS??* You've gotta be *joking*!! I ripped into some psych literature and
<br>
found there was a body of evidence on this variation in mental modality
<br>
(cognitive mapping and mental imagery studies were not yet fashionable, not
<br>
for decades yet), but no educators seemed to have noticed. I went to my
<br>
English prof and said I'd like to do research in this area. He looked down
<br>
his nose and said with a sniff that in that case I might wish to change my
<br>
major to... (yuck)... psychology. NOT THE POINT, d00D, I wanted to shout,
<br>
but I was far too polite in those days. I'm not sure much has changed
<br>
since. (Although postmodernist approaches to the text would eschew anything
<br>
as crass and literally minded as image-like imagery; even so, the shared
<br>
*experience* of mental imagery probably underpins most enthusiasm for
<br>
reading fiction and poetry. Is this true of sf readers? We like gaudy or
<br>
numinously cosmic settings, but I wonder if the tendency to *actual*
<br>
visualizations--in comix, magazine illos, special FX movies, rendered
<br>
games, etc--might reflect an appeal to a lot of people who like the ideas
<br>
but *don't* autonomously roll their own images.)
