<p>Actually, I'm becoming more convinced that the window is fairly wide.
<br>
We can assume that there is a fair amount of redundancy in the brain.
<br>
Why?  Because we *know* that minor strokes do not generally eliminate
<br>
my self-consciousness.  Of course there are arguments that there may
<br>
be fairly critical brain areas for specific functions that one would
<br>
not lot wholesale loss of -- but we may also be optimistic that we
<br>
will understand the functions of these areas to replace them with
<br>
nanorobot assists should that be necessary.
<br>
<p>It turns out that the &quot;synapses&quot; are pretty hard-wired together.
<br>
There are &quot;velcro&quot; like proteins that actually hold the synapses
<br>
in place.  I suspect it takes quite a long time for these to
<br>
break down (perhaps days -- we need to do research studies here).
<br>
Of course &quot;freezing&quot; will disrupt some of these -- but there will
<br>
be pretty big fingerprints that the nanorobots can use to reconnect
<br>
things.  Of greater significance might be the activation of acidic
<br>
proteases normally confined to the lysosomes (due to a buildup of
<br>
lactic acid in a non-oxygenated brain).  So it may be critical for a
<br>
medical team to either keep you on a respirator or intervene in such
<br>
a way to keep your blood pH on the alkaline side.
<br>
<p>If in fact you have prepared properly and instructed your primary
<br>
caregivers properly, I don't think that significant damage need
<br>
result from the time-of-death until the time-of-suspension even
<br>
overseas.  But you have to accept that the average medical person
<br>
is *not* going to know the procedures to follow to minimize structural
<br>
breakdown in the brain after death occurs.  Interestingly enough after
<br>
you are &quot;dead&quot; there should not be any legal barriers to the medical
<br>
people or suspension team administering the 21st Century Medicine
<br>
&quot;brain cocktail&quot; (the one they use when they freeze dogs but they
<br>
don't expect to get FDA approval of because the FDA won't approve
<br>
&quot;cocktails&quot;).  Ideally one would want to administer it *before*
<br>
death but better late than not at all.
<br>
<p>To my way of thinking preparation is probably more important than
<br>
location in minimizing damage due to suspensions.  What one needs
<br>
is a critical mass of people committed to cryonics that caregivers
<br>
can make a business of being &quot;up-to-date&quot; on the best suspension
<br>
methods.
