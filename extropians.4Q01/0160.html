<p>Calm down, pal. Go out and shoot some planes.

<p>BTW, I just carelessly emailed a huge post to the list providing copious

journal refs to previous claims in this area. I realized the moment I'd

sent it that what I *should* have done was invite those few people (if any)
<br>
who were interested to ask me to send the bibliography offlist, rather than
<br>
clog everyone's pipes. Since that post hasn't appeared yet, maybe a list
<br>
filter stopped it going out. If not, my apologies for thoughtlessness. If
<br>
it *was* blocked, here's my short comment again, and interested bods should
<br>
ask me for more offline.

</em><br>
<p>The moment you open the psi/paranormal jar, all kinds of hopeful monsters
<br>
fly out. Forget God as an explanation for the moment (it's rather
<br>
disgusting, isn't it, to imagine that the creator of the universe reaches
<br>
down and modifies natural processes for a few while allowing other
<br>
innocents to suffer). The default assumption seems to be that *the
<br>
intention to heal* somehow directly modifies the state description of the
<br>
foetus or the mother. But that sounds like a rather more complicated and
<br>
improbable process than activating whatever pre-existing physiological
<br>
systems a placebo state activates (reduced cortisol, etc). So how could a
<br>
paranormal effect initiate placebo if the Ss don't know they're targets of
<br>
beneficent intentions? Via a paranormal information channel, silly. They
<br>
*sense unconsciously* the loving vibes that are bathing them, and respond
<br>
by, you know, relaxing their toes and turning their faces to the sunlight.
<br>
<p>One vector is as unlikely as the other, but I kinda prefer cognitive
<br>
paranormality (information tweaks in a chaotic neural system) than kinetic
<br>
ones (non-local but precisely targeted energy transmission).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;it feels to me more like fraud
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or silliness, after all. But I will still be looking forward to more news
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on this subject. 
</em><br>
<p>There's a vast amount of published studies of the alleged efficacy of
<br>
prayer, not to mention `therapeutic touch', etc.
<br>
<p>If anyone's really interested in trawling for decently conducted studies,
<br>
here's a list of refs, plus a short article on the topic, that a guy sent
<br>
me recently (now you're all sorry you asked; and no, I don't believe in the
<br>
Tooth Fairy and have no inclination to believe in this stuff either):
