<em>&gt; One thing to worry about, though, will be people objecting to the idea

</em><br>
<p>I would think so too.  I bet it would hardly be noticeable.  Moreover,
<br>
even if it were and opposition to noticeable solar farms was effective,
<br>
they could moved to places less viewable or not viewable at all from
<br>
Earth, such as the far side or near enough to the far side to still be
<br>
in line of sight yet not noticeable.  This would them less efficient,
<br>
but is still a potential solution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For this reason, it may be preferable to make solar farms as efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as possible, to reduce the footprint on the earthside view. I think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a good idea to run up some computer simulations with graphic
</em><br>

</em><br>
ground
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; layouts and ground coverage percentages that would be undetectable at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eagle resolutions would help mitigate environmentalists claims that
</em><br>
such
<br>
<em>&gt; farms would somehow significantly alter the way that animals perceive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moon, since it is allegedly of importance to how some animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; navigate, etc...
</em><br>
<p>Not a bad idea and also I think people advocating lunar solar farms
<br>
should devote a lot of effort toward recruiting the NIMBY and
<br>
environmental types -- the ones that are recruitable -- so that they,
<br>
too, can promulgate the notion of off planet power generation.  If the
<br>
choice is offered as either more power plants on Earth (of whatever
<br>
type) vs. more in space or on the Moon, I think many of them would
<br>
choose the latter, other things being equal.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
