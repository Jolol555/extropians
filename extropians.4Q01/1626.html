heh? That is a very old dodge used by every tyranny that ever

existed on earth.  Is my insistence I know nothing of substance

to the questions being asked a sign of dishonesty or the simple
<br>
truth?  Will doping me up to a hyper-suggestible state
<br>
necessarily bring us any nearer the truth or will it make it
<br>
easier to extract exactly what the questioner wants to hear?  
<br>
This type of interrogation is not admissable in court among
<br>
other reasons because it is not terribly reliable.  Leaving
<br>
aside for a minute that it is a fundamental act of force against
<br>
a human being in their most sacrosanct aspect of their very
<br>
mind.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; inconceivable to me. As long as all the information becomes public within a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And who determines what is &quot;reasonable time&quot; or insures that the

information has actually been made public without doctoring? 
<br>
Why, these very officials who use these means to extract it.  NO

THANK YOU!

<em>&gt;   What could be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #### The rack, the Iron Maiden, a car chase. Narcoanalysis is not torture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's about as forceful as a urine test and you remember less.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
I don't take urine tests either.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    What happened to the 5th amendment?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>OK.  This conversation is beyond anything I can remotely

consider reasonable.

<em>&gt;    What happened to privacy?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    What happened to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrosanct individual?  All gone for a little more &quot;security&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### The individual life is as sacrosanct as it gets and that's why we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect it by &quot;prying open minds&quot;, if necessary.
</em><br>
<p>Then what is this &quot;life&quot; or its value that is left if it can be
<br>
destroyed and pryed open at any suspicion by any authority? 
<br>
What is there left to protect if this is legitimate?  Can you
<br>
protect by destroying and denying the value of that which you
<br>
claim to protect?
