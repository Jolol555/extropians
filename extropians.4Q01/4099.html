If you don't shop at the Big &amp; Tall, and if composites are used, 30 shp _might do_. Obviously, MEMS turbines etc. would
<br>
shift things. See

<br>
<p>for the authoritative poop on the 1950s-era Model 1033, XROE-1 Hiller Rotorcycle. 
<br>
<p>Excerpted  &amp; condensed:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Power was supplied from a Nelson H-59, two
<br>
cycle, 40 hp, four cylinder opposed air cooled engine through a centrifugal clutch. The prototype Rotorcycle first flew
<br>
on January 10, 1957....&quot;
<br>
Main rotor dia. 18.50 ft. Maximum height 92 in. 
<br>
Gross weight 546 lbs; Empty weight 290 lbs; Useful load 270 lbs.
<br>
Maximum speed (sea level):70 mph;  Cruise: 52 mph;  Rate of climb: 1160 ft/min.
<br>
Effective range: 30 miles; 
<br>
Range at sea level (with 170 lbs. pilot and 86 lbs. of fuel): 166 miles
<br>
<p>More recently (like _now_), <a href="http://www.engineeringsystem.co.jp/Prd_GENH-4.html">http://www.engineeringsystem.co.jp/Prd_GENH-4.html</a> has a coaxial rotor gizmo that has been
<br>
flying as a prototype for at least two years. It also flies with 40 hp. They spec their pilot weight at _155 lb_.
<br>
<p>Spike, are you listening? Time to suit up and preflight... We need you to help us integrate the Ginger/Segway avionics
<br>
suite. :)
