<em>&gt; I think they are mostly complimentary.  In order to sustain technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cultural progress we need a market like social structure -- one that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily, nonlinearly search the possibility space for new ideas.  (Markets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are spontaneous orders; ultimately, the kind of libertarianism proposed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others and me is based on an equality of authority -- each person being her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or his own leader -- rather than an equality of some results.)
</em><br>
<p>I would say markets are a special case (a very important special case)
<br>
of the general spontaneous order; there are many non-market spontaneous
<br>
orders such as evolution and swarm processing that also do nonlinear
<br>
searches. But I agree that we need a market like social structure,
<br>
something that enables the exploration and growth of different
<br>
solutions. This is essentially the Popperian defense of the open society
<br>
on the grounds that it conforms with evolutionary epistemology. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, I think market-like structures -- or social structures that allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market interactions -- i.e., individual, voluntary ones -- are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian than the alternatives.  This does not mean every society must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly the same, down to the lowest interaction level.
</em><br>
<p>In fact there is a benefit in having different societies - just as there
<br>
is a benefit in having many problem solving styles within a society,
<br>
there is a benefit of having different social problem solving styles
<br>
within the society of societies. And just as in the previous case the
<br>
rules of this metasociety ought to minimize conflicts between societies
<br>
and enable individual, voluntary interactions between them. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Notably, the more free, in terms of individual initiative -- what other type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of freedom is there? -- a social there is, the more overall progress there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typically is.  Also, self-transformation and not serving a social order is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hallmark of such societies.  (Granted, members of such societies might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not always choose the right way to do this and most people, sadly, prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confromity, but this is true of all society types.)  Such societies also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhibit practical optimism, since the focus of change is usually at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microlevel -- not at the level of grand social schemes than absorb and blur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out individual choice.  All of these are Extropian values, right?
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. Different cultures and social systems are not equivalent when
<br>
it comes to allowing the development of transhuman virtues. At the same
<br>
time, there might be interesting issues of how they could be expressed
<br>
in cultures with different values (I'm reading Geert Hofstede's work on
<br>
different cultures right now); the culture differences between the
<br>
europeans and americans on this list is just a minor example - the
<br>
complications when adapting the transhumanist conceptual framework to
<br>
cultures with great power distance and low levels of individualism. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, a society that stifles microlevel change is, in my eyes, less like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamic society able to support progress.  At best, the command society can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foster sweeping changes but only top down.  The directions for change are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited, and typically many individuals are unable to adjust.  They get left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out.  Strict majority rule, e.g., does this.  The majority gets its way.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the majority wants pizza, the rest can't choose to have the salad or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Which is why so much effort has been put into the creation of liberal
<br>
democracy rather than majority democracy, and why no major countries
<br>
have majority democracy. I think Hoppe was ignoring this to a large
<br>
extent in his article, making it an attack on democracy rather than on
<br>
stifling top-down solutions. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me explicate another point.  I think we can all agree that Extropianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be optimally carried out is not compatible with every form of society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a meta-issue in this debate.  Or do we agree on this?
</em><br>
<p>I agree at least. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The question to ask is how the current society should and could be
<br>
changed to increase the possibility of extropian dynamism. Given the
<br>
above discussion it seems that we actually have some fairly clear ideas
<br>
on what kind of institutions would favor extropianism, at least within
<br>
our own societies.
