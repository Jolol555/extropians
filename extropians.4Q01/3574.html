One way to approach this empirically would be to ask what beliefs would
<br>
spread in a society of agents which are capable of backup/restore,
<br>
or perhaps equivalently of some form of destructive teleportation.
<br>
<p>Would agents evolve to act as if their &quot;successors&quot; (after a backup and
<br>
restore cycle) were as important to them as future selves which had not
<br>
gone through such a change?
<br>
<p>If accepting backup/restore as benign were to increase survival prospects
<br>
for the successors, then agents which adopted such beliefs would tend
<br>
to increase in numbers, and eventually these beliefs would come to
<br>
be widely accepted.
