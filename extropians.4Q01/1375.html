Autonomic Computing Q&amp;A v1.1
<br>
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/overview/faqs.html">http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/overview/faqs.html</a>
<br>
<p>What is autonomic computing?
<br>
Autonomic computing is an approach to self-managed computing systems with a
<br>
minimum of human interference. The term derives from the body's autonomic
<br>
nervous system, which controls key functions without conscious awareness or
<br>
involvement. Autonomic computing is an emerging area of study and a Grand
<br>
Challenge for the entire I/T community to address in earnest.
<br>
<p>What are the origins of autonomic computing?
<br>
Autonomic computing is the evolution of a long tradition of understanding and
<br>
creating self-regulating systems. It's risen to the top of the I/T agenda
<br>
because of the immediate need to solve the skills shortage and the rapidly
<br>
increasing size and complexity of the world's computing infrastructure.
<br>
<p>What is the goal of autonomic computing?
<br>
The goal is to realize the promise of I/T: increasing productivity while
<br>
minimizing complexity for users. It's time to design and build computing
<br>
systems capable of running themselves, adjusting to varying circumstances, and
<br>
preparing their resources to handle most efficiently the workloads we put upon
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>What does autonomic computing promise to deliver?
<br>
Most immediately, the automated management of computing systems. But that
<br>
capability will provide the basis for much more: from seamless e-sourcing and
<br>
grid computing to dynamic e-business and the ability to translate business
<br>
decisions that managers make to the I/T processes and policies that make those
<br>
decisions a reality. Ultimately, autonomic computing is a challenge that must
<br>
be met before the industry can deliver 'the next big thing.'
<br>
<p>What is IBM doing to drive this idea to the rest of the industry?
<br>
First, IBM is focusing its R&amp;D efforts around the challenges of autonomic
<br>
computing, in addition;
<br>
IBM will distribute 75,000 copies of the autonomic manifesto to the top
<br>
technical and scientific minds in the world;
<br>
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/manifesto/">http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/manifesto/</a>
<br>
Over the next few years, IBM will fund at least 50 grants to unversities to
<br>
encourage additional research on the challenges of autonomic computing;
<br>
IBM will organize a scientific conference focusing on autonomic computing in
<br>
early 2002.
<br>
IBM will also host several conferences and symposiums on progress and
<br>
challenges, and continue to encourage our best minds to actively participate
<br>
in research outside of IBM;
<br>
Company-wide, IBM is developing products that contain key autonomic features
<br>
through Project eLiza. (eLiza Homepage)
<br>
<p>How does IBM plan to work with other technology companies?
<br>
IBM has thousands of partners in all areas of the industry. IBM Research is
<br>
highly regarded for collaborating with leading national and university labs
<br>
around the world. In addition, we're supporting an extensive grant program,
<br>
and we'll form a consortium of experts from the I/T industry to help guide and
<br>
shape the future of this effort.
<br>
<p>What will a world based on autonomic computing look like?
<br>
In the future, human intervention in most tasks associated with systems
<br>
management will seem as archaic and unnecessary as asking an operator for help
<br>
making a phone call seems today. Initially, you'll see more availability of
<br>
the systems that serve you --- your bank, your ISP, your travel agent. You'll
<br>
hear, 'sorry, our systems are down' less often. Simultaneously, autonomic
<br>
features will begin to appear in client level devices so that your individual
<br>
PC will complete for itself many of the tasks that currently make you a
<br>
part-time administrator. If you had to stop and get out of your car every few
<br>
hours to check under the hood, make a minor adjustment, or restart the car
<br>
because of some unknown glitch, it would take a long-time to reach your
<br>
destination.
<br>
<p>What actually exists in autonomic computing today?
<br>
Much of the progress today has come from work on mainframes, but we've also
<br>
seen advances in open standards and storage. For instance, the TCP/IP standard
<br>
upon which the Internet is based has made possible an unprecedented level of
<br>
interoperability. In storage, Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID)
<br>
present a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard
<br>
disks, which improves performance and increases fault tolerance. To date, the
<br>
most progress in autonomic computing has been made with IBM's eLiza
<br>
initiative. Launched by IBM to develop self-managing servers, software, and
<br>
networks. IBM's autonomic computing efforts have already yielded:
<br>
IBM's Intelligent Resource Director (IRD), a self-managing operating system
<br>
for the eServer z900, which allows the server to dynamically reallocate
<br>
processing power to a given application as workload demands increase;
<br>
Workload management, which is available for IBM's mainframes and is being
<br>
extended to heterogeneous platforms;
<br>
The self-healing cellular architecture of Blue Gene, a high-speed machine now
<br>
under construction at IBM Research, which will detect failed processors and
<br>
redistribute work to compensate for their loss without interruption;
<br>
Tivoli's Intrusion Manager, an integrated approach to security that reduces
<br>
the overall complexity of security management.
<br>
<p>What is the difference between eLiza and autonomic computing?
<br>
Project eLiza is IBM's initiative to develop self-managing servers, software,
<br>
and networks. It's just one piece of the autonomic picture. Autonomic
<br>
computing is an emerging area of study and a Grand Challenge for the entire
<br>
I/T community to address in earnest; an approach to self-managed computing
<br>
systems with a minimum of human interference and it includes all facets of
<br>
I/T -- software, hardware, architecture and more.
<br>
<p>What's the difference between autonomic computing and your Intelligent
<br>
Infrastructure initiative of a few years ago?
<br>
Although the two are related -- autonomic computing actually includes all of
<br>
what we considered Intelligent Infrastructure -- the difference between them
<br>
is a matter of perspective. For Intelligent Infrastructure, we were basically
<br>
acting as technologists trying to plug holes in a dam we saw as about to
<br>
flood: not enough skilled I/T people to keep up with I/T demand. So the
<br>
solution was to improve the infrastructure by embedding intelligence in it.
<br>
<p>Pretty soon, though, we realized that approach wouldn't address some of the
<br>
most pressing problems I/T customers faced. So with autonomic computing, we
<br>
are looking at things from the ultimate end user's perspective and the point
<br>
of view of the I/T customer: what behaviors do they need computing systems to
<br>
exhibit to get the most value and benefit from them?
<br>
<p>Can you be more precise in defining grants and the dollar commitment?
<br>
We are just beginning the process of soliciting proposals and laying out a
<br>
strategic agenda -- we invite the academic community to help us in this. As we
<br>
evaluate proposals, we can better determine the specifics of individual grants
<br>
and amounts. But we are committed to funding a steady stream of work in this
<br>
area. Of course, we can't do it all by ourselves; that's why we're asking the
<br>
NSF, the I/T industry, and national labs around the world to target autonomic
<br>
computing as they fund crucial I/T research.
<br>
<p>How do you think AC will change the way businesses are conducted?
<br>
One of the first examples is e-sourcing, which is gaining traction now.
<br>
e-sourcing is the ability to deliver I/T as a utility, when you need it, in
<br>
the amount you must have to accomplish the task at hand. Autonomic computing
<br>
will create huge opportunities for these emerging kinds of services.
<br>
<p>Is autonomic computing being developed at places other than IBM?
<br>
Yes, and what we're trying to do now is focus all of that great work together
<br>
so the I/T community can address this Grand Challenge. There is already a
<br>
terrific amount of work being done at university labs like Berkeley, MIT,
<br>
University of Texas, University of Michigan and more. IBM has been doing work
<br>
in this area for years in aspects of self-managing servers, self-tuning
<br>
software and the like.
<br>
<p>Isn't autonomic computing the same as creating intelligent machines?
<br>
This is partly a matter of definition. If &quot; intelligent machine&quot; means one
<br>
that embodies human cognitive powers, the answer is no. But if that term is
<br>
taken to mean systems that can adapt, learn and take over certain functions
<br>
previously performed by humans then autonomic computing does involve the idea
<br>
of embedding this kind of intelligence in computing systems.
<br>
<p>Does autonomic computing replace AI?
<br>
No. In fact, Artificial Intelligence is a critical discipline that will help
<br>
bring about autonomic computing. AI-related research, some involving new ways
<br>
to apply control theory and control laws, can provide insight into how to run
<br>
complex systems that optimize to their environments. But to be clear,
<br>
autonomic computing does not require the duplication of conscioius human
<br>
thought as an ultimate goal. In our opinion, this is not the primary issue
<br>
that needs addressing now.
<br>
<p>What are the biggest technical hurdles to autonomic computing?
<br>
We don't know all of them yet; we're still exploring. That is why its so
<br>
important for the I/T community to step up to this challenge. We know that a
<br>
great deal of innovation and hard work will be required. For example,
<br>
extending capabilities that exist on one platform to others, defining system
<br>
management identities and relationships, and figuring out how to effectively
<br>
map business policies to system policies. Clearly standards will be an
<br>
enabler.
<br>
<p>When will autonomic systems be available?
<br>
Truly autonomic systems are years away, although in the nearer term, autonomic
<br>
functionality will appear in servers, storage and software. Certain aspects of
<br>
autonomic systems are already available. IBM's eLiza initiative has already
<br>
determined a roadmap and will deliver aspects of this shortly. For instance,
<br>
IBM's z900 eServers have a self-managing operating system known as Intelligent
<br>
Resource Director (IRD).
<br>
<p>What academic institutions are currently exploring autonomic computing?
<br>
We know of work at the University of California-Berkeley, University of Texas,
<br>
University of Wisconsin, MIT, and the University of Michigan that can apply to
<br>
this approach. And we are interested in learning about other work going on
<br>
around the world that may be directly or indirectly related. IBM hopes to
<br>
expand these efforts and spread the study of autonomic computing to other
<br>
institutions by awarding some 50 research grants dedicated to the study of
<br>
autonomic computing.
<br>
<p>How does autonomic computing address the need for skilled I/T workers?
<br>
By embedding and automating I/T infrastructure complexity, autonomic computing
<br>
will require fewer I/T professionals to worry about configuring, maintaining,
<br>
fixing, securing, updating and generally running systems. More importantly, if
<br>
systems and networks become autonomic, I/T professionals will be able to work
<br>
at a higher level. Imagine not having to worry about making sure that mundane,
<br>
complicated tasks are handled correctly by humans -- repairing root causes of
<br>
failure, bringing servers to 'dry-dock', or resource allocations.
<br>
<p>This is the ultimate benefit of autonomic computing: systems that tackle the
<br>
complexity 'under the covers', freeing I/T professionals to drive creativity,
<br>
innovation and opportunity. Entire new business models will emerge.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
