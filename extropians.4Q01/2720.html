</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;...we can estimate that there's nearly an 80 percent chance that

</em><br>
<p>Good question Anders.  I have been working over my models in
<br>
order to predict when the next record will be set.  I have a
<br>
few observations to report, but it is unclear the extropian angle.
<br>
So if you do not like math or computers, please read no further.
<br>
<p>Other than the fact that the new Mersenne prime detected yesterday
<br>
was a nearly 1.5 sigma long gap between primes, the event is not
<br>
far from my expectations.  In Damien's book I calculated about an
<br>
80% chance by 11-01, but in fact I was a little cowardly in my
<br>
model of the increase in computer speed.  Had I known in December
<br>
1999 that we would have covered this much ground in two years,
<br>
I would have calculated a 87.3% probability of a Mersenne in that
<br>
interval.
<br>
<p>A complete report is being prepared for my website.  This is
<br>
a short preliminary report:
<br>
<p>I estimated the number of participants about right, and the
<br>
numbers of machines doing factoring and double checking
<br>
was predicted fairly accurately.  The speed of computers
<br>
as a function of time I derived from Ideas Futures.  I assumed
<br>
that those who traded in those memes knew what they
<br>
were doing, and they nailed it almost right on.  But where I
<br>
really messed up was underestimating the impact of the
<br>
Pentium4.  The P4 instruction set is twice as fast as a
<br>
similarly clocked P3 in doing the FFTs used in the Lucas-
<br>
Lehmer algorithm.  So I blew that one.  But I have a new
<br>
version of the model that takes these developments into account.
<br>
<p>I am currently tuning my model using new information on the
<br>
speed of processors and a really cool Matlab tool Ive been
<br>
experimenting with, a homebrew Butterworth filter thingy.  But
<br>
preliminary estimates indicate that mersenne prime number 40
<br>
has about a 50% chance of being discovered by November 02.
<br>
If discovered earlier, the word &quot;by&quot; means the start of November.
<br>
If discovered later, the word &quot;by&quot; means the end of November.  {8^D
<br>
<p>I expect to sharpen this prediction in the next few weeks, so
<br>
stay tuned.  In the mean time, if you want to join GIMPS, there
<br>
is an extropians team.    For some time we were running neck
<br>
and neck with the Meeeeensa team.  Go to the link below and
<br>
follow the instructions.  The password to join is maxmore.
