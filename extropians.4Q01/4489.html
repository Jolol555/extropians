<p>Lousy hint because they do hate us because we're infidels, or more
<br>
specifically successful infidels. They hate the fact that we're rich and
<br>
despite siting on top of most of the world's oil they are not. Most of all
<br>
they hate the western popular culture that is spreading all over the world
<br>
and the fact that the Taliban popular culture is not.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;stop the knee-jerk  support of Israel.
</em><br>
<p>Oh no, I agree with you on something! I'd better reexamine my position.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Remove  our military bases from Muslim holy lands.
</em><br>
<p>If you think the root of these problems is a few hundred American
<br>
soldiers in Saudi Arabia a thousand miles from Mecca you live in
<br>
a delusional world.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Stop manipulating the governments of countries
</em><br>
<p>You mean do something that no other country has ever done, or even tried
<br>
to do in the entire history of the world? It's not going to happen nor should it.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Stop bombing Iraq and lift the sanctions.
</em><br>
<p>Samantha I beg you, consider the implications of what you are saying.
<br>
Saddam Hussein's Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world,
<br>
today he would also own of the first and third largest too and thus control
<br>
the world economy if he hadn't been defeated militarily (and I'll bet you
<br>
opposed that too, tell me if I'm wrong). Here is a man who invaded his neighbors,
<br>
slowly tortured and murdered his political opponents, spent billions on chemical
<br>
and biological weapons while his subjects live in poverty and children starved,
<br>
here is a man  who dropped nerve gas bombs on his own people, a man who
<br>
is frothing at the mouth to obtain nuclear weapons, and how do you advise
<br>
dealing with a man like that, what do we do the next time he decides to engage
<br>
in murder at the wholesale level? Well, we certainly can't do anything militarily,
<br>
we can't do anything economically either, and considering your well known
<br>
horror of insults (directed at anybody but me that is) we can't even give him a
<br>
good tongue lashing as we might hurt poor Saddam's feelings, the only method
<br>
you advises in dealing with such creatures is always slight variations on the
<br>
same basic theme, be nice to people and people will be nice to you. Well, that
<br>
might work on Sesame Street but it won't work on the Arab street or in Baghdad.
<br>
Samantha the unfortunate truth is that monsters exist and the only way to deal
<br>
with them is to put a bullet in their brain.
<br>
<p>THOUGHT EXPERIMENT: Society A is run along lines Samantha Atkins would
<br>
approve of, Society B is ruled by Saddam Hussein. I don't think there can be any
<br>
serious doubt of the outcome, Society B lives Society A does not.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;reading bin Laden in context does not lead me to believe he thinks
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;all who are not Islamic fundamentalist should be killed.
</em><br>
<p>Yea, I'd think the same thing, if I ignored what he said, and what he did.
<br>
It's really astounding that even after seeing that horrible video tape where he's
<br>
laughing at the death of thousands you're still making excuses for that animal.
<br>
Bin laden is not a man you compromise with, he is not a man you want to have
<br>
a meeting of minds with, he's a man you want to put a bullet in the brain of.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; We need to stop acting like global bullies
</em><br>
<p>What a incredibly distorted world view! Thousands of innocent Americans
<br>
are butchered by ignorant immoral barbarians but it is the Americans that
<br>
are the bullies. Well, at least your advice is consistent.
