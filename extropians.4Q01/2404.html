<em>&gt; I think your assumption is an inappropriate use of Occam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; razor: we should disbelieve the existance of something if we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _no reason_ to think it exists; but the mere fact that we can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up with a handy example (which may just be a personal failing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on my part to communicate) shouldn't be taken that seriously when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we _do_ have reasons (specifically, our knowledge of how the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works) to believe they exist.  We don't really have a good example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a black hole either; but we have good reason to think they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist, and we even think we've spotted the side-effects of them.
</em><br>
<p>Apply Occam's Razor rather like this: We can explain &quot;Non-sensory experiences&quot;
<br>
and ghosts, etc., by simply recognizing and acknowledging that people do in
<br>
fact hallucinate. We do not know how the brain works, but we do have some
<br>
clues about how it fails to work.
<br>
<p>No examples of black holes? Check this out:
<br>

<br>
One black hole that has been detected was the black hole in the giant galaxy
<br>
M87. This galaxy is a dense and violent place. This photograph taken in 1994
<br>
by the Hubble Space Telescope shows a disk of hot gas was orbiting at the
<br>
center of this massive galaxy. The disk is located at the lower left corner of
<br>
the picture. Observations show a central density so high that the only object
<br>
it could be is a black hole. The picture also shows the black hole shooting
<br>
off energy. The energy is composed of fast moving charged particles and has
<br>
broken into pieces as small as 10 light years across.
<br>
Glowing gas clouds are streaming from the core of a galaxy NGC4151 at hundreds
<br>
of thousands of miles per hour. Using the powerful tool from the Hubble Space
<br>
Telescope's new STIS instrument, it is possible to map out the cloud
<br>
velocities - producing this false color velocity map for the central regions
<br>
of NGC4151. The horizontal line is light from the intensely bright region near
<br>
the galaxy nucleus. Emission at two wavelengths characteristic of oxygen atoms
<br>
in the gas clouds is visible along this line. Where do the clouds come from?
<br>
As scientist receive evidence, the explanation for energetic nuclear activity
<br>
in galaxies based on material spiraling into a central black hole with over a
<br>
million times the mass of our sun is proving to be right.
<br>
These are a few examples of black holes and what they are. In the future, as
<br>
IRAS documents get more researched and uncovered more black holes will be
<br>
found. Also, when WIRE gets launched, it will for sure spot some black holes.
<br>

<br>
Researchers using the Hubble Space Telescope announced today that they had
<br>
found new examples of black holes residing in nearby large galaxies. Their
<br>
results indicate that most large galaxies seem to have so-called supermassive
<br>
black holes, black holes weighing anywhere from 10 million to 10 billion times
<br>
the mass of our sun.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
