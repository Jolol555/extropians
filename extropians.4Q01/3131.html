</em><br>
<p>Exactly. And Kass is also aware (see his last year piece against cloning
<br>
in The New Republic) that there exists an evolutionary avant garde that
<br>
is for such technologies - us - and he thinks they must be stopped. He
<br>
explicitely said that a posthuman future must be prevented.  Nice to
<br>
know he has the president's ear, isn't it?
<br>
<p>While Kass can be faily easily attacked through his relatively sloppy
<br>
statements and ethical reasoning, he has a great network. I would
<br>
consider him somewhat less dangerous than Rifkin and RAFI, but he still
<br>
represents a dangerous opponent. 
<br>
<p>What we need is not just to show how wrong his arguments are, we also
<br>
need to develop a transhumanist bioethical thought. We have discussed it
<br>
a bit here and there, but we need a lot of more development before it
<br>
can stand on its own. Unless we can show a better alternative to
<br>
bioconservative bioethics the debate will always move between the
<br>
bioconservatives and the more liberal bioethics, not anywhere near our
<br>
&quot;bioradicalism&quot;. So even a compromise in bioethics will be on the
<br>
conservative side. 
<br>
<p>As an example for something we could try developing further is my
<br>
TransVision text on morphological freedom:
<br>
<a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Texts/MorphologicalFreedom.htm">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Texts/MorphologicalFreedom.htm</a>
<br>
Another good text to start with is J. Huges &quot;Embracing Change with All
<br>
Four Arms: A Post-Humanist Defense of Genetic Engineering&quot; (which I
<br>
really like): <a href="http://www.changesurfer.com/Hlth/Genetech.html">http://www.changesurfer.com/Hlth/Genetech.html</a>
<br>
<p>Any other good examples we could work with? The fact that we have
<br>
somewhat different political default assumptions doesn't mean we can't
<br>
see the unifying principles.
