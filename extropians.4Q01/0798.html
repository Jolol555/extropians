</em><br>
<p>I've been pointing out this problem for at least the last 6-7 years.
<br>
It is a fundamental issue of perspectives.  Robert Freitas deals with this
<br>
in section 1.2.2 of Nanomedicine (www.nanomedicine.com -- or *buy*
<br>
the book) developing the &quot;Volitional Normative Model of Disease&quot; --
<br>
discussing 8 different types of disease concepts in existing practice:
<br>
<p>1. Disease Nominalism
<br>
2. Disease Relativism
<br>
3. Sociocultural Disease
<br>
4. Statistical Disease
<br>
5. Infectious Agency
<br>
6. Disease Realism
<br>
7. Disease Idealism
<br>
8. Functional Failure
<br>
<p>He proposes the &quot;volitional normative&quot; model as a way out
<br>
of the swamp seeking to move towards definitions that deal
<br>
with &quot;optimal&quot; or &quot;desired&quot; functioning -- of course these
<br>
tend to be subjective (client side) perspectives than
<br>
objective (server side) perspectives.  However(!) - a &quot;desired&quot;
<br>
function to be an &quot;optimal&quot; blocker in football such that half of
<br>
the opponents you face in a single game become sidelined with
<br>
injuries is -- to me -- a questionable criteria for saying
<br>
you have a &quot;disease&quot; if you cannot achieve this.
<br>
<p>If you want to *really* grab the bull by the horns consider
<br>
this -- the &quot;gold standard&quot; for scientific &quot;proof&quot; of efficacy
<br>
is a double blind random trial.  So, Company X has a treatment
<br>
that retards or better still completely prevents aging.  You
<br>
run an clinical trial according to the &quot;gold standard&quot;.  You look
<br>
at the results.  If your treatment is successful, all of the
<br>
people receiving it are still alive.  All the people not receiving
<br>
it are dead.  If the treatment *really* prevents aging then
<br>
it was presumably highly immoral (not that I think I know what
<br>
that word means anymore...) to even run the trial.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I'll give Laura a call next week and see if she can
<br>
tell me which of the 8 disease concepts the FDA subscribes to.
<br>
<p>Double, double, toil and trouble,
<br>
fire burn and cauldron bubble...
<br>
<p>Robert
