Anders provided a detailed response to my supposition that he
<br>
might be a &quot;moral relativist&quot;.  I would cite his summary:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To sum up, rights only get voided when actions make your rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfere with the rights of others, and even then the decrease in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights is partial, temporary and ideally should be minimal. 
</em><br>
<p>So the key point seems to be &quot;actions&quot; from his position.
<br>
If one does not take &quot;actions&quot; then one can only loosely be
<br>
accused of violating the rights of others.
<br>
<p>By this argument, it would seem that Mr. bin Laden is nowhere near
<br>
as guilty as the pilots of the recent planes turned into bombs.
<br>
He has supplied funds to and trained terrorists but has not
<br>
really committed any terrorist acts himself.  It would seem
<br>
that from the &quot;action&quot; perspective that conspiracy to commit
<br>
acts of terrorism is a less heinous crime than acts of
<br>
terrorism themselves.  And yet we now know that conspiracies
<br>
can cause a much greater loss of freedoms than any single
<br>
act of terrorism.
<br>
<p>I would be interested in solutions he might propose for solving
<br>
problems of individuals such as bin Laden who seem likely to
<br>
retain positions of promoting actions that will cause the loss
<br>
of freedoms for the forseeable future.
<br>
<p>An interesting counterpoint to this is an about Sara Jane
<br>
Olson:  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/07/national/07OLSO.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/07/national/07OLSO.html</a>
<br>
<p>In essence she has been forced to enter a guilty plea to plotting
<br>
to bomb two police cruisers 26 years ago because she feels it
<br>
is impossible to receive a fair trial after recent events in
<br>
spite of the fact that she did not make, hold or plant the bomb.
<br>
