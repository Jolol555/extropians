I think in our discussions of moral relativism, we should distinguish
<br>
between two forms of it, which I'll call strict moral relativism and moral
<br>
equivalidity.
<br>
<p>Strict moral relativism says there is no objective morality. Moral values
<br>
are relative to individuals, and there is no way to compare two moral
<br>
systems except subjectively. No argument exists which can convince a
<br>
person to change his morality (assuming it's well defined and does not
<br>
contain internal contradictions) by appealing solely to his rationality.
<br>
<p>Moral equivalidity goes further and says that because there is no
<br>
objective morality, all moralities are equally valid. Therefore we should
<br>
treat all moral systems symmetrically. For example we should never mention
<br>
that something is considered good in one moral system without also
<br>
mentioning that it is considered evil in another moral system.
<br>
<p>I think the recent criticism against moral relativity is really against
<br>
moral equivalidity rather than strict moral relativity. But moral
<br>
equivalidity is simply a logical contradiction and therefore pointless to
<br>
criticize on other grounds. Since it itself is a subjective morality,
<br>
moral equivalidity leads to the conclusion that we should treat it
<br>
symmetrically with all other moralities which claim moral superiority. But
<br>
that is a logically impossible thing to do, so one could only believe in
<br>
moral equivalidity while avoiding thinking through its implications.
<br>
<p>Someone might argue that strict moral relativism leads logically to moral
<br>
equivalidity, therefore strict moral relativism is also a contradiction. I
<br>
would say that's not the case, that in fact moral equivalidity is an
<br>
example of the naturalistic fallacy. Just because moralities are symmetric
<br>
in some objective sense, doesn't mean we ought to treat them symmetrically
<br>
for the purposes of guiding our own actions. There are many ways to break
<br>
the apparent symmetry between moralities. My personal favorite is to use
<br>
the indexical fact that I am me, and simply accept my own moral system as
<br>
privileged above all others.
