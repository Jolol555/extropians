<em>&gt; The controversy about Maher concerns me.  All he said was that, contrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to W's claims, flying a plane into a building is a brave act (however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heinous),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while shooting cruise missles from 2 countries away is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cowardly action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's absolutely right;
</em><br>
<p>I share this concern.  We must be careful to assess any enemy accurately and
<br>
completely.  Calling these terrorists &quot;cowards&quot; is merely a misplaced
<br>
insult.  It is misleading because suicide bombers or religious fanatics are
<br>
not motivated by cowardice.  They are motivated by martyrdom and promises of
<br>
an afterlife.  Any security defense set up to deter cowards will fail.
<br>
<p>This was one of the main failures of our previous security systems.  Such
<br>
systems assumed that hijackers wanted to live.  Our airline crew training
<br>
procedures, air traffic control procedures and military procedures were all
<br>
based on this assumption.  This is why everyone let the hijackers continue
<br>
unchallenged.  The only exception was the final flight that knew what
<br>
happened to previous flights.  With this new knowledge, they fought back and
<br>
prevented a fourth massacre.
<br>
<p>If we mistakenly assume that these terrorists are cowards, we will again be
<br>
devising inappropriate security procedures that do not deter these kinds of
<br>
terrorists.
