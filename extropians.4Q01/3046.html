Non-member submission from [<a href="mailto:nedkelly@leary.csoft.net?Subject=Re:%20American%20&quot;imperialism&quot;&In-Reply-To=&lt;20011122053114.32024.qmail@mail63.csoft.net&gt;">nedkelly@leary.csoft.net</a>]

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The recent debate about US interventions in other countries is
</em><br>
pointless
<br>
<em>&gt; because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lack of non-US citizens on this list.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, hey, I was going to write something along this line in the
<br>
meta &quot;this list has gone to the dogs&quot; post earlier, but gave up half way
<br>
through as 
<br>
I just couldn't be bothered with it.
<br>
<p>but what the hell. I lurk, I used to write to this list years and years
<br>
and YEARS ago.
<br>
But I stopped a while ago as the list became saturated with a vicious
<br>
right-wing mindset, 
<br>
which I'm sure I could spend the rest of my life arguing against, but
<br>
lives tend to
<br>
not be that long, so I'd rather have one than spend all my time arguing
<br>
with maniacs.
<br>
<p>The impression I have gotten is that a hell of a lot of other people
<br>
feel the same 
<br>
way, leaving the list overpopulated with maniacs.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Most New Zealanders do not mind US interventions _as long as_ they see
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; America is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not acting in its own interests and that it is acting altruistically
</em><br>
towards
<br>
<em>&gt; other people.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is, does *anyone* beleve america acts altruistically? Even
<br>
if it does, it's
<br>
considered dubious by most people. The Gulf War is a classic example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That said, the opinions of New Zealanders are sadly based on (a) what
</em><br>
other
<br>
<em>&gt; NZers tell them to think (b) What they see on Tv
</em><br>
<p>You have just described 90% of the Western world.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; An example is East Timor. Recently, during the lead up to the
</em><br>
independence
<br>
<em>&gt; vote, when Timorese were being terrorised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Indonesian militias, there were calls in this country by pacifist
</em><br>
lefties
<br>
<em>&gt; for the US to liberate East Timor.
</em><br>
<p>The US actually offered troops to supervise the elections and that was
<br>
strongly 
<br>
rebuffed by Australia and others. These troops were then frantically
<br>
called for 
<br>
when the shit actually *did* go down, but I found it highly interesting
<br>
that 
<br>
other than the initial newspaper report, this has never been mentioned
<br>
in 
<br>
Australia since then
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, the various anti-american americans on the list miss the point-
</em><br>
the US
<br>
<em>&gt; is reacting to the &quot;intervention&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Osama bin Ladens forces on its soil, so the retaliation in
</em><br>
Afghanistan is
<br>
<em>&gt; clearly different to other interventions in the past.
</em><br>
<p>Well, allegedly retaliating, we have yet to see any evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is significant that the various and bloody Soviet interventions
</em><br>
were
<br>
<em>&gt; never demonised in teh same way as american actions.
</em><br>
<p>??? You are joking, aren't you? There was a huge global outcry, the
<br>
Moscow 
<br>
Olympics were torpedoed, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may or may not be significant that Samantha assumes responsibiltiy
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; all actions by individuals in the US govt for the past 50 years.
</em><br>
<p>She's a spook!
<br>
<p>I see it as two aspects, there's the American *people* and there's the
<br>
American 
<br>
*govt* which I think is a tool of big business and international
<br>
capital, and 
<br>
will simply bail when it gets too awkward, much as they bailed out of
<br>
Europe 
<br>
when it got sticky in the middle of last century. A lot of people blame
<br>
the 
<br>
US *people* whereas a lot of the americans I know complain bitterly
<br>
about 
<br>
how they feel that they have lost control of their govt to business
<br>
interests.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately the NYC attack was aimed at the people and not the govt.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The proper role for US foreign policy is to operate by principle
</em><br>
rather than
<br>
<em>&gt; benefit to US (these 2 are not mutually exclusive) . I am not sure why
</em><br>
it is
<br>
<em>&gt; not so since in new zealand the govt has often pursued an idealistic
</em><br>
foreign
<br>
<em>&gt; policy at cost to our relations with other countries eg the Labour
</em><br>
govts
<br>
<em>&gt; stance on nukes in 1985 resulting in terrorism by France on the
</em><br>
Rainbow
<br>
<em>&gt; Warrior and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the collapse of the ANZUS treaty with America. The reason is that NZ
</em><br>
voters
<br>
<em>&gt; wanted idealistic foreign policy and Labour wanted to be in govt,
</em><br>
rather
<br>
<em>&gt; than Labour being altruistic.
</em><br>
<p>I think you'd find that if NZ was a world-striding collossus like the US
<br>
<p>then the NZ govt would be highly imperialistic, the same as the govt of 
<br>
all major world Powers are, sort of goes with the turf. NZ can afford to
<br>
<p>be idealistic as the biggest threat to NZ is an invasion from Samoa. 
<br>
If NZ were stuck in the middle of Africa or Asia then I suspect things 
<br>
would be a wee tad different.
