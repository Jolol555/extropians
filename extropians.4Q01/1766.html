<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Nor does calling downloading of copyrighted material &quot;theft&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually being in possession of illegally copied material is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; defined in the criminal code as theft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's completely false.  Copyright infringement is defined in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Title 17 USC Chapter 5, as both a civil tort and criminal offense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; called &quot;copyright infringement&quot;.  The word &quot;theft&quot; appears nowhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the statute, and existing laws and penalties for larceny do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not apply to any acts specified there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not only are you arguing the law instead instead of substance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you're arguing it incorrectly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee, Lee, Lee, it is rather obvious to anybody who isn't being purposely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disengenuous that taking something offered for sale without paying for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is theft. You can call it 'copyright infringement' as the specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charge, but any idiot can tell you that such falls under a general class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of activities known generically as 'theft'. There are likely plenty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other statutes describing crimes that fit that general class that do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention the word in them.
</em><br>
<p>If the claim had been merely &quot;I believe that copyright infringement is
<br>
tantamount to theft&quot;, then it would merely have been an opinion to which
<br>
one is perfectly entitled.  But Brian specifically used the words &quot;defined
<br>
in the criminal code&quot;, presumably to give his argument force of authority,
<br>
so it is completely fair to point out that his carefully-chosen words are
<br>
a testable statement of fact, and are false. 
<br>
<p>And you're the one being disingenous when you describe copyright
<br>
infringement as &quot;taking what is offered for sale without paying for it.&quot;
<br>
You know very well that whether or not the information is available
<br>
for sale is irrelevant to copyright law.  I also infringe, for example,
<br>
if I post on my website text from a book out of print, or a derivative
<br>
work of a book out of print, with a dead author (say, for example, I
<br>
make an obscene cartoon with the characters of Mickey and Minnie
<br>
mouse).  Copyright law can serve to prevent useful works from being made
<br>
available to the public for sale or otherwise.  It's also irrelevant
<br>
whether or not the party using the information knows whether or not it is
<br>
for sale.  I could, for example, download a piece of software marked as
<br>
&quot;public domain&quot; from some site, not knowing that it was in fact a
<br>
copyrighted work that someone else sanitized, and I'd have no way of
<br>
knowing that.  The kid who downloads a Sting song probably knows that he
<br>
is violating copyright law, so he may well feel that &quot;theft&quot; is an
<br>
appropriate term for him, but there are hundreds of other acts of
<br>
copyright infringement that don't deserve that label, even if one
<br>
generally agrees that some kind of copyrights are justified.
