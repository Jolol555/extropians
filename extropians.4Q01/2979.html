<p>Which is why the CIA organised a coup in 1953 that ousted a 
<br>
democratically elected prime minister (in Iran) and installed
<br>
an hereditary dictatorship, huh? (Clue: the previous Iranian
<br>
government was not a Soviet proxy.)
<br>
<p>It had a hell of a lot more to do with cheap oil, and taking
<br>
over the former British and French spheres of interest in the 
<br>
middle east (acquired during the collapse of the Ottoman Empire
<br>
in the 1918-1930 period) than with anything as long-term and
<br>
enlightened as combating communism.
<br>
<p>_That_ particular pigeon came home to roost with a vengeance
<br>
in 1979 (although the signs suggest that Iran is settling 
<br>
down again).
<br>
<p>The picture of &quot;democracy vs totalitarianism&quot; is a cosy, comforting
<br>
one but by no means universally true. In fact, much of what went
<br>
on during the Cold War was more along the lines of an imperial
<br>
power-grab, as US companies moved into the power vacuum left
<br>
behind by the withdrawl of the former colonial powers and then
<br>
lobbied for backup from the State Department.
<br>
<p>This isn't to exculpate the Soviets -- who were in it for
<br>
whatever they could get -- but if you look at a polar projection
<br>
map of the world, centred on the North Pole, as it looked in 1960
<br>
in terms of alliances, it looks *very* different from the Mercator
<br>
projection so common in Western school rooms. Clue: which projection
<br>
do you think was hanging in the Kremlin?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These things have to be considered in their historical context.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely! And the sad fact is, history as taught in the US appears
<br>
to be about as accurate as the history taught in Japanese or German or
<br>
Russian schools, or preached in mosques ... i.e., not very.
