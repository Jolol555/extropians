<br>
<p>should get you a long list of articles related to mitochondrial aging.
<br>
The first is Aubrey's original proposal about the mechanisms
<br>
behind the mitochondrial theory.
<br>
<p>You can also search on his name by entering: &quot;de Grey AD&quot;[au] into
<br>
the query box (I can't seem to figure out how to make a URL for that).
<br>
<p>In summary, Aubrey thinks that mitochondria that experience
<br>
mutations or deletions in the mitochondrial DNA are going to
<br>
be less efficient at producing free radicals and damaging
<br>
themselves.  Because they have less damage, they are degraded
<br>
less frequently by the lysosomes.  Eventually they would
<br>
come to dominate the mitochondrial population in the cells.  Another
<br>
possibility is that if they have deletions in their mitochondrial DNA
<br>
they could replicate more quickly allowing them to gradually become
<br>
the dominant population.
<br>
<p>Cells with diminished ATP capacity (due to the defective ATP
<br>
production) may be less able to conduct maintenance and repair
<br>
functions and gradually accumulate damage in a increasing spiral
<br>
that could lead to cell death.  Scientists have demonstrated that
<br>
there are cells, esp. muscle cells that do have individual
<br>
muscle fibers that have accumulated a population of mitochondria
<br>
that have deletions in their DNA.  The hard part is tying this
<br>
into aging -- if the cells eventually die and effectively
<br>
&quot;disappear&quot; and if this occurs at a very slow rate, then
<br>
detecting them in the process of doing this is likely to
<br>
be difficult.
<br>
<p>Mitochondrial aging may only be a problem in tissues composed
<br>
primarily of non-dividing cells such as muscles, heart, neurons,
<br>
kidneys, etc. and is likely to be a completely distinct problem
<br>
from those involving the anti-cancer program, telomeres and the
<br>
Hayflick limit which primarily involve tissues with dividing cell
<br>
populations.
<br>
<p>One can explain the rare presence of mitochondrial defects in
<br>
newborns the same way one explains the lack of mutations in general --
<br>
organisms have relatively robust mechanisms for detecting
<br>
improperly developing offspring and terminating the development.
<br>
Its a big waste of resources to be producing offspring with
<br>
a reduced ability to survive -- one would expect there to
<br>
be a lot of selection pressure against such situations.
