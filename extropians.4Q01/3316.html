<p><em>&gt; Quite. However, a proper examination of the Dresden incident,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I have always personally considered area bombing a war crime, but then
<br>
again, if they hadn't used it, would the nazis have won?
<br>
Were *any* allied soldiers charged with war crimes after WW2?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, I don't regard Hiroshima or Nagasaki to be primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist acts. By late in the war, both the German and Japanese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments had so thoroughly mobilized and armed their societies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preparation for invasion of their home territories that the only people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there that could be considered 'non-combatants' under the Geneva
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conventions were those in POW camps and patients in hospitals.
</em><br>
<p>You know, I spent 2 minutes searching on google for &quot;hiroshima end war&quot; 
<br>
and found a lot of evidence to suggest that this is entirely wrong. 
<br>
Refer to my quote yesterday from the head of the Joint Chiefs, or
<br>
whatever he was.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Under the Geneva Conventions, when a combatant hides behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-combatants or in non-combatant facilities, those then become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combatant targets as well, legally.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, well, what about the &quot;highway of death&quot; out of Kuwait? Soldiers
<br>
fleeing a battle are non-combatants, yet a hell of a lot of people were
<br>
massacred on that road.
