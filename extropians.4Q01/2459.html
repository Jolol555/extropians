<br>
&lt;&lt;The FBI and CIA were asleep at the wheel, allowing one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;megalomaniacal cultural-extremist fanatic, born to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-importance and anomalous wealth, to create a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrorist organization with a substantial degree of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;competence.  The FBI and CIA should have been watching
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and weren't.  The rest of the US wasn't watching
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it wasn't their job.  The terrorists did their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing, caught us by surprise, scored way big in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;category of television drama , and the US took a hit.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>-Makes sense
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Islam is a museum piece, which long ago condemned
<br>
itself to irrelevance and memetic morbidity by
<br>
renouncing progress in favor of the stagnation of
<br>
theocratic authoritarianism.  And fundamentalist
<br>
Islam, like other forms of fundamentalism, is little
<br>
more than a cult of death, a cult of bitter old men,
<br>
who hate all that they have lost: youth, originality,
<br>
energy, and a love of the promises of life.
<br>
<p>I'm gonna stick my neck out and predict that Al Quaida
<br>
will fold with a whimper.   
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>-It doesn't matter if you find their ideology unworthy and insipid, because 
<br>
it is well-financed and tolerated well, by a large fraction of the Islamic 
<br>
world. Think of them rather, as the old fantasy villains, SPECTRE, from the 
<br>
James Bond Movies/Novels. Now the lazier and stupider the American 
<br>
intelligence groups are, the more likely that eventually these guerilla 
<br>
groups will be able to use weapons of mass destruction against us. All we 
<br>
would have had to do is keep on carrying-out the American foreign policy, 
<br>
pre- 911, that was exhibited by both Clinton and Daddy Bush.
<br>
<p>Al-Qeida will not fold without a fight. Osama wants a glorious death. America 
<br>
and the West needs a new energy policy, and not provide the Islamic world 
<br>
with the financial means to provide spoiled children with the toys of mass 
<br>
destruction.
