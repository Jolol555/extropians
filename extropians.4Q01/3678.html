<p><em>    &gt;The key phrase here is &quot;as far as the economy is concerned&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;When we are talking about identity and survival, most people want &quot;
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;as far as I am concerned&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly, precisely, what I was trying to say. I don't care if protoplasm
<br>
is destroyed because I am not two hundred pounds of protoplasm, I am a adjective.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I do not believe that the laws of physics will distinguish between what
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;you  call &quot;things&quot; and &quot;non-things&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>What is the mass of beautiful? Tell me the position in space of the number eleven.
<br>
What is the temperature of swiftly? What is the entropy of red?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;if you have two MP3 files of the same symphony on your  computer and
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;&gt;you erase one file you are not poorer for it because nothing has been lost.
</em><br>
<p><em>   &gt;I claim something has been lost, but you don't see it because your example
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;is something that can be easily duplicated.  What if the music industry
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;succeeds in making uncopyable music files.
</em><br>
<p>The premise of the thought experiment was that you could make a copy of
<br>
anything, if you remove that then all bets are off and we are back to the world
<br>
we all live in now. Today there is two hundred pounds of protoplasm that I
<br>
am particularly found of because right now it the only matter in the universe
<br>
that behaves in a johnclarkian way, but that need not always be true.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;After all, I do have a natural clone walking around, but I still believe that
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;something would be lost if one of us were destroyed.
</em><br>
<p>Come on now play fair, we both know a twin is not a copy.
