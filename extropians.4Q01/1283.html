<p>Another factor (which I think was far more significant) that made Europe
<br>
and Japan rebound fairly quickly was the presence of a large civil
<br>
society with working institutions that just needed a bit of flushing.
<br>
The courts worked in most of Europe, and hence property rights and
<br>
contracts could be upheld and the economic and social bootstraping
<br>
process could get into gear. 
<br>
<p>The problem with a country like China is that if the institutions are
<br>
corrupt you won't get any trust building with the government, and the
<br>
government cannot help build any trust between individuals and groups
<br>
(which it can in a land with working contract law). Hence you get
<br>
low-trust societies where a lot of necessary services are provided by
<br>
relatively local, informal or unaccountable institutions - which doesn't
<br>
promote the emergence of trust outside the group and the formation of
<br>
the larger structures necessary for a modern capitalist society (or any
<br>
other workable large scale peaceful society). 
<br>
<p>Culture can help and hinder; it seems that societies with high levels of
<br>
power distance are generally poorer than societies with lower power
<br>
distance, but this is apparently something that slowly changes as a
<br>
society becomes more modern (if I read my Hofstede right) - but power
<br>
distance also helps corrupt institutions to remain unaccountable and
<br>
hence slows the development. I wonder how Confucian Dynamics affect
<br>
China in this respect; to me it seems like something that creates a
<br>
local optimum of a fairly resilient society but hinders the development
<br>
into a modern society - but this could be my western libertarian bias.
<br>
Greg might have a better idea here.
