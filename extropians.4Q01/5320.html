A comment made by Eliezer has been rattling around in my
<br>
head for over a week.  The phrase was something like ~
<br>
&quot;...those in denial of the hard-takeoff model of the singularity...&quot;
<br>
<p>While I see that the hard takeoff Singularity is perhaps the most
<br>
well-known model, let us look at possible alternatives and even
<br>
consider deriving closed form equations, if at all possible,
<br>
to describe singularity models.
<br>
<p>If we did that, I can imagine a term in the growth equation
<br>
which we have no knowledge of, since those terms have
<br>
always been zero in the regime where the growth rates of
<br>
knowledge are on the order we have seen historically and
<br>
today.
<br>
<p>For instance, hard takeoff fans: perhaps there an unknown factor
<br>
where friendly AI begins to develop its own next generation,
<br>
but a sub-AI, not necessarily &quot;unfriendly&quot; but just misguided,
<br>
attempts to halt or reverse the growth of AI.  Could there be
<br>
a machine level equivalent of luddites and reactionary religious
<br>
notions?  Is such a thing even imaginable?  I can imagine it.
<br>
<p>We now have clear examples of human level intelligences (humans)
<br>
who openly wish to turn back the advance of knowledge, destroy
<br>
that which a particularly successful subgroup of humans has created.
<br>
How can we be certain that human equivalent (or greater-
<br>
than-human equivalent) AI will not somehow get the same
<br>
idea?  Furthermore, how can we be certain that this anti-
<br>
singularity AI would not have much more potential to slow
<br>
or reverse the singularity than the current human-level intelligences
<br>
have?  Would not the net effect would be a soft takeoff singularity,
<br>
or even a series of failed Spikelets before The Spike?  spike
