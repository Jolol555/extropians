Update on the Wayback Machine which archives all information posted to
<br>
the web since 1996;

<p>Web mega-archive raises legal questions

A website called the Wayback Machine last week opened a gateway to more
<br>
than 10 billion archived Web pages. But it also opened a can of worms.
<br>
<p>The site has been using software robots to record Web pages since 1996.
<br>
But these include pages that were later removed by site owners because
<br>
they contained material that was pirated, illegal, or deemed too
<br>
sensitive. 
<br>
<p>When the archive went live last week, the US Nuclear Regulatory
<br>
Commission had to ask archive founder Brewster Kahle to pull sensitive
<br>
information the site had resurrected on America's nuclear reactors -
<br>
which the NRC had removed from its website after the 11 September
<br>
attacks.
<br>
<p>New Scientist's search of the Wayback Machine confirms the NRC material
<br>
has gone. But the potential problems don't end there. We also found
<br>
copyrighted material that had been removed from a site because it was
<br>
posted without its owner's permission. 
<br>
<p>&quot;There are definitely some potential legal issues with this archive,&quot;
<br>
says Cindy Cohn, legal director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. 
<br>
<p>Dumb bot 
<br>
<p>The Wayback Machine's robots periodically record every page on the web,
<br>
unless they are stopped by bot-blocking software. But the bots won't
<br>
know if, for example, a site has been taken down because a judge has
<br>
ruled it defamatory, or to settle a lawsuit out of court. Nor can they
<br>
identify pirated material or child pornography.
<br>
<p>Like the Wayback Machine, the Google search engine also stores copies of
<br>
Web pages in case servers fail. But this &quot;cache&quot; is flushed every three
<br>
weeks, says Google, adding that it removes sensitive material when
<br>
asked.
<br>
<p>US law imposes fines between $200 to $150,000 for copyright
<br>
infringements. And even though unwitting infringers usually pay the
<br>
lower amount, the presence of thousands of copyrighted works stored on
<br>
pirate websites could be ruinous for the Wayback Machine's backers, who
<br>
include the Library of Congress and the National Science Foundation.
<br>
<p>&quot;It would be a real shame if copyright concerns were to deprive us of
<br>
this valuable public service,&quot; says Fred von Lohmann, a senior lawyer at
<br>
the EFF.
