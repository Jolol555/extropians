<p>The power consumed in the family home is a small fraction of the total
<br>
per capita power consumption of an individual in modern technological
<br>
civilization. Far more is consumed in the recovery, refining,
<br>
production, and distribution of the products that each and every
<br>
individual uses. Migrating all of the production of this power to the
<br>
individuals property would rapidly bring home how significant this is
<br>
compared to the miniscule amount of energy used in the home.
<br>
<p>There is no such thing as a 'fully self reliant single family home' in
<br>
the modern world. Even the act of building such homes leaves the
<br>
individual in debt for their lifetime paying the energy cost of creating
<br>
all the materials used in it's construction.
<br>
<p>It is also for this reason that further advances in consumption
<br>
efficiency will be getting progressively more expensive: industry has
<br>
gone much farther than the homeowner in investing in efficiency.
