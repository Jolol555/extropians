Samantha had retracted her comments about U.S. bioweapons programs:
<br>
<em>&gt; After digging a bit more it looks like I was too cynical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding the US and bio-weapons. If we have an offensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program still going in this area it is damn well hidden. 
</em><br>
<p>Scientific American, December 2001, pgs 21-23 has a discussion
<br>
by Ed Regis, &quot;Evaluating the Threat&quot;.  He recently wrote
<br>
&quot;The Biology of Doom: The History of America's Scret Germ
<br>
Warfare Project&quot; (Holt, 1999 and so is presumably qualified
<br>
to comment on it.
<br>
<p>He lists the primary reason that states have chosen to
<br>
get out of the bioweapons business -- bioweapons are
<br>
simply lousy weapons.
<br>
<p>&quot;the reason being that although organisms are excellent killing
<br>
machines, they make poor weapons.  For one, because of the long
<br>
incubation period of many pathogens, the effects of use are not
<br>
immediate.  Second, the resulting epidemic could be mistaken for
<br>
a natural outbreak of the disease instead of one caused by the
<br>
enemy.  Third, the effect of biological aerosols is uncertain,
<br>
dependent on chance fluctuations of wind and weather.  For all
<br>
these reasons, biological weapons are not as dramatic, attention-
<br>
getting, reliable or visually overpowering as conventional high
<br>
explosives.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sciam.com/2001/1201issue/1201scicit2.html">http://www.sciam.com/2001/1201issue/1201scicit2.html</a>
<br>
<p>Problems not mentioned are the fact that bioweapons have the
<br>
increased risk of civilian casualties and they can more easily
<br>
be turned against you (if stolen) than say nuclear weapons
<br>
where one might need &quot;codes&quot; or &quot;missles&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a military standpoint the U.S. already has more than
</em><br>
enough material for &quot;mass destruction&quot; (~100 tons of plutonium),
<br>
so if I were managing the defense budget, it would make much
<br>
more sense to spend tax dollars on delivering high explosives
<br>
(or bombs) precisely and reliably.
<br>
<p>Another more unsettling issue is the likelyhood of a nuclear
<br>
war between Pakistan and India (which of course could spread).
<br>
These 2 antagonists are potentially producing enough material
<br>
for dozens of atomic bombs annually.
