<em>&gt; I have finally had a chance to look at Bartley's _Retreat to Commitment_,

<em>&gt; in the public today. 39 years it's been sitting there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bartley probably overrated intellectual honesty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first thing most people retreat to is always commitment, it seems.

<em>&gt; I don't exclude this list. I admit to having done my share of it.

<em>&gt; &quot;The primary purpose of thinking is to abolish thinking.&quot;--E. de Bono in a
</em><br>
saturnine mood.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes one _must_ retreat to commitment. But I want it to be my last
</em><br>
refuge
<br>
<em>&gt; as much of the time as is practicable.
</em><br>
<p>I was impressed by Bartley's book when I read it about a decade ago.  (I
<br>
still ahve yet to read his book on Wittgentstein, but I did read and like
<br>
his, I believe, final book, _Unfathomed Knowledge, Unmeasured Wealth_.)
<br>
<p>On the subject of the book, see my very brief &quot;Comments on Pancritical
<br>
Rationalism&quot; at <a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/PCR.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/PCR.html</a> , though it's not
<br>
an attempt to utterly refute the whole book...
<br>
<p>Cheers!
