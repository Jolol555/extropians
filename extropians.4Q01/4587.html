I was wondering if you could provide details on how military aid can 
<br>
destabilize a country.  I know you provided sources, but unfortunately I 
<br>
can't read German, so if you could explain this phenomenon, or direct me to 
<br>
a site in English that would do such, I'd be much obliged.  I was under the 
<br>
impression that during the cold war we were in the habit of stabilizing 
<br>
countries whether they needed stabilization or not (propping up dictators...).
