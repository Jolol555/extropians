Daniel wrote, quoting Murry Rothbard:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The private individual, secure in his property and in his capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resource, can take the long view, for he wants to maintain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital value of his resource. It is the government official who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must take and run, who must plunder the property while he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still in command.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm.... Up until recently, more than half of all Americans were
<br>
not wealthy enough (or educated enough) to invest in the stock
<br>
market.  Taking the &quot;long view&quot; presumably requires that one
<br>
balance ones resources between real estate, cash, precious metals
<br>
*and* stocks (because stocks over the long run have provided the
<br>
greatest return on capital).  Without various levels of government
<br>
with various resources (armies to police forces) whose job it is
<br>
to protect the &quot;private individual&quot; *how* can one feel &quot;secure&quot;
<br>
so that one can take the long view?  If I'm spending all of my
<br>
time trying to evaluate how much to pay for support of a
<br>
&quot;private&quot; security force and reading the reports evaluating
<br>
whether or not they can effectively protect my property, then
<br>
I'm *not* going to have the time to read SEC filings by corporations
<br>
so I can reasonably allocate capital resources.
<br>
<p>As I pointed out offlist to Alex, it is a question of delegation
<br>
and trust.  If I have to evaluate and manage my own protection
<br>
then I have to pay someone else to manage my capital allocation.
<br>
Or I can manage my capital allocation and pay someone else to
<br>
evaluate and manage my protection.  Why do people implicitly
<br>
assume that governments are &quot;plundering&quot; and &quot;running&quot;.  Yes,
<br>
there have been individuals that have done that but it seems
<br>
to be the case that more and more they are being brought to
<br>
justice for such crimes.
