<p>&nbsp;From John Smart &lt;<a href="http://members.home.net/marlon1/">http://members.home.net/marlon1/</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p>&quot;...Even if they anticipate that the singularity speculation may be correct,
<br>
they know that human beings do not easily model exponential change.
<br>
<p>As Arthur Clarke, Francis Crick, and now, Ray Kurzweil have proposed,
<br>
this may be primarily because human cognitive (and perhaps, perceptual)
<br>
systems appear to be built to make quasi-linear models, at least on a
<br>
first quantitative approximation, whereas the computational elements
<br>
and general systems of our local environment exhibit exponential
<br>
emergences and other natural non-linearities. So it is that humanity
<br>
only unevenly—and often unrealistically—incorporates exponential
<br>
expectations within its psychology, as we now wisely do, for example,
<br>
in our expectations for next year's computer products, and less wisely,
<br>
in our expectations for the short-term performance of many technology
<br>
investments.
<br>
<p>Even if humans are wired to directly perceive reality in a nonlinear manner,
<br>
as some cognitive scientists propose (recall that human organisms are
<br>
themselves nonlinear systems so their emergent computational
<br>
architecture must, at least on a fundamental level, also be nonlinear
<br>
itself), it is nevertheless true that exponential systems, before they reach
<br>
the &quot;blowup&quot; phase of their growth, appear to be linear systems, and so
<br>
we, as slow modelers of fast systems, are continually taken by surprise
<br>
in the ferocity of their emergence. As an example, you may recall the
<br>
famous chess board metaphor, involving 64 doublings of rice grains,
<br>
with only one grain placed on the first square. This system appears
<br>
quite tame until a bit past the middle of the board, when it suddenly
<br>
produces an entirely unexpected and overwhelming effect, bankrupting
<br>
the King, and overwhelming the surface of the Earth in a sea of rice.
<br>
So it will apparently soon be with local computation.&quot;
<br>
