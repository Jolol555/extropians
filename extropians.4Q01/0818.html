<p>Lucky for us, most of those with the technical capability of devising
<br>
such a thing are solidly in the other half.
<br>
<p>Also, there are plenty of things that I don't use and even see as
<br>
detrimental to society. Yet, I wouldn't push a button that would
<br>
forever abolish say, football, meat consumption, or marriage. Besides
<br>
the obvious moral objections, there is the fact that I might be
<br>
wrong-- sports might in fact 'mold character', meat might be good for
<br>
you, and marriage might... might...  might keep you off the streets
<br>
and out of bars or something. Even if the world would be a slightly
<br>
better place without these things, the short term chaos would greatly
<br>
outweigh the benefit, and would probably harm me personally.
