<em>&gt; Switzerland has a 100% household gun ownership rate for all citizen

<em>&gt; households. It's the law, as a matter of fact, and large percent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those guns are machine guns. I believe the 27% rate reflects the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate of *handgun* ownership.
</em><br>
<p><p>Some people interested in these matters may wonder about the meaning
<br>
of this, so here's a bit of explanation, as I happen to know this
<br>
first hand (I was born in Switzerland and did military service there).
<br>
<p>Switzerland has an army with the militia system. This means that every
<br>
male citizen has an obligation to do military service, which is as
<br>
following : first you do a 4 months school at age 19 ; then every 2
<br>
years (until you are 42) you do a 2 or 3 weeks session of &quot;practice&quot;.
<br>
<p>When doing the school part, you are given a personal machine gun. In
<br>
fact there is a little ceremony in which a superior officer gives it
<br>
to you saying : &quot;Your personal weapon.&quot; (In the rougher parts of the
<br>
army, they actually throw the gun at the guy, but I was in
<br>
intelligence so it was gentler. :-) )
<br>
<p>This does become your &quot;personal weapon&quot; as you take it back home when
<br>
the school is over, and then bring it back for the &quot;practice&quot; sessions
<br>
in the following years.
<br>
<p>Additionaly, each year the citizens must go in shooting stands and do
<br>
a specific shooting programme, where they need to get a minimal score
<br>
(otherwise they must do the programme again). This is so that they
<br>
keep well trained. One shoots laying down at 300 meters. The shooting
<br>
training is extensive whatever the part of the army you're enrolled
<br>
in, and includes grenades. Handguns are used by officers only.
<br>
<p>It looks like the system may change now, and turn to a profesionnal army.
<br>
<p>Note that though military service is an obligation, quite a few people
<br>
are exempted and do not do it (so 100% is a bit of an exaggeration,
<br>
and also don't forget the households without any adult male person).
<br>
If so, they must pay a tax equal to 2% of their income to make up for
<br>
their lack of involvement. Women CAN take military service but have no
<br>
obligation (a very tiny percentage do).
