Anders posted an analysis of how chatty the list is and Mark
<br>
offered the suggestion of an Extropian scale rating.
<br>
<p>Rant mode on.
<br>
<p>Anders happened to do his survey on my birthday, so there
<br>
was some list &quot;noise&quot; associated with that fact.  Of course,
<br>
*I* do not think messages by people acknowledging my birthday
<br>
should be considered as &quot;noise&quot;! :-)
<br>
<p>Mark didn't literally copy the Subject line from Anders post and
<br>
as a result, it isn't getting grouped with the conversation in
<br>
the Javien archives.  [PEOPLE(!) please be aware of the fact
<br>
that Extropian &quot;mailing list&quot; is no longer simply a mailing
<br>
list.  It is archived in at least 2 forums.  Until the software
<br>
gets much more intelligent, if you want to be part of a
<br>
conversation, you *NEED* to pay attention to the Subject lines.]
<br>
<p>As some of you are aware, I gave up on the Extropian &quot;mailing list&quot;
<br>
concept a year ago or more.  The noise to signal ratio is simply
<br>
too high to be bothered deleting most of the messaages from my mailbox.
<br>
Friends to whom I have recomended the list subscribe to it and then
<br>
unsubscribe relatively quickly for the same reason.  Only if
<br>
there is a topic of very high interest (e.g. are we living in
<br>
a simulation) do I resubscribe for brief periods.  Our &quot;message&quot;
<br>
is not getting shared because so much of it is simply not
<br>
our &quot;message&quot;.
<br>
<p>I typically browse the Javien archives now for useful stuff but
<br>
consider that rather noisy as well.  What is needed is something
<br>
that combines the best features of Slashdot, the Javien forum
<br>
and mailing lists.
<br>
<p>The Slashdot approach is good for the reasons that (a) You can get
<br>
headline trailers from it; (b) messages get moderated up or down;
<br>
(c) it has catagories that you can subscribe to or ignore.  The
<br>
Javien forum is very good from the perspective of displaying the
<br>
conversation flow in a visual manner, but I can't seem to make
<br>
the review/rate functions work (and even if they did, I doubt
<br>
enough people are currently using the Javien Forum to make it
<br>
as useful as the Slashdot moderation functions are.
<br>
<p>Both Slashdot and Javien's Forum suffer from the lack of
<br>
integration with email software.  If I start a conversation,
<br>
I should not have to continue returning to it to &quot;hear&quot; what
<br>
is going on.  A conversation once started should end up putting
<br>
messages into my mailbox until it either fades away, or I instruct
<br>
the conversation &quot;monitor&quot; to stop forwarding messages from that
<br>
conversation.  Presumably, each conversation should accumulate
<br>
its own unique &quot;mailing list&quot; for everyone who has contributed
<br>
to the conversation.  Similarly the conversation moderating
<br>
agent should be able to selectively search for &quot;keywords&quot; or
<br>
&quot;authors&quot; and forward posts containing those to my mailbox.
<br>
This type of approach provides the best of both worlds --
<br>
I can treat the Javien Forum or a Slashdot hosting system as
<br>
a &quot;newspaper&quot; that I read for news.  I can also use them as
<br>
a &quot;conversation manager&quot; to function as a facilitator for
<br>
conversations between people with similar interests.
<br>
<p>Now, currently we don't have the software to do that --
<br>
for this to work more people need to use the Javien forum
<br>
and more people need to contribute to the development of
<br>
the software (it is open source after all).
<br>
<p>In the meantime, I would argue that the best solution to the
<br>
problem may be to create an additional mailing list or two.
<br>
[This could eventually morph into the &quot;subscription topics&quot; you
<br>
have in systems like Slashdot.
<br>
<p>I'd argue that &quot;extropians&quot; list should move more towards
<br>
hard-core extropic topics.  I think a new list should be
<br>
created for the &quot;social&quot; conversations (e.g. exi-social)
<br>
where presumably 50% of the content will be authored by Spike. (:-))
<br>
An additional possibility is the creation of a list which
<br>
is focused on &quot;news-of-interest&quot; (exi-news) where the long
<br>
repostings from other sources or URLs to such topics should be posted.
<br>
If we write these up as guidelines and discipline ourselves
<br>
to follow them, this would go a long way toward meeting the
<br>
needs of the group until a more intelligent system can be
<br>
developed.
<br>
<p>Rant mode off.
<br>
<p>Comments?
