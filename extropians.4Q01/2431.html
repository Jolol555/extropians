<em>&gt;From: Amara Graps &lt;<a href="mailto:Amara.Graps@mpi-hd.mpg.de?Subject=Re:%20War%20Support%20Ebbs&In-Reply-To=&lt;200111092119.NAA12666@well.com&gt;">Amara.Graps@mpi-hd.mpg.de</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;While you are congratulating yourselves on how the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government has every right to continue its current path ...
</em><br>
<p>I don't think anyone's congratulating themselves on the U.S. once
<br>
again having to roll up it's sleeves and go after another bad guy.
<br>
<p>It's a miserable thankless job that has to be done is all.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I would like to point out that there are meters and meters of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blood underneath the soil here in Europe, and Europeans do *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want a World War III. And this is what they see the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American path leading to. I don't think that many Americans have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a deep understanding of this fact of the pools of blood here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There will come a point, in the not-to-near-future when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Europeans say &quot;I'm sorry, we won't help you fight your war.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>Have people over there suddenly gone goofy? Plenty of that blood is
<br>
American! Find me a European who thinks they could have gotten out
<br>
of WW II without us.
<br>
<p>They don't have to join us, we'll clean the toilet ourselves.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Of course, Europe is not as strong as America, and there's going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be a lot of negotiating in the European politicians card-hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to see what possible things they can do to stop the destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;path that the U.S. government is following.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me, thousands of our people were murdered in cold blood.
<br>
<p>We'll take care of it. 
<br>
<p>Maybe they can sign treaties with Bin Laden like they tried to do
<br>
just before WW II. Yeah placate! That's the answer.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The U.S. government (and other western governments) has created
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some real messes in the world, and Afghanistan and the Middle East
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a biggie. One of the nice things about America, is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politicians *do* listen, to some extent, to what the U.S. public
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has to say there (witness Vietnam).
</em><br>
<p>We didn't create either Afghanistan nor the middle east mess,
<br>
although we've made some bad moves in the region.
<br>
<p>But that doesn't justify what happened, and we're not going to stop
<br>
till those responsible pay the price.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I could offer suggestions here, but I think I'll stop for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moment. This issue issue makes me exhausted and very upset.
</em><br>
<p>Intelligent suggestions are always welcome.
