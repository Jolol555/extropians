<p>NO, I don't have such a grudge.
<br>
<p>Let's get back to what is to me the central issue of
<br>
our debate.
<br>
<p>I contend that you have primitive/backward political
<br>
idols in your head that are at the same level as the
<br>
Vatican, Mormons, Baptists, Islam &amp;c. As long as these
<br>
idols infest your mind it's extremely unlikely that
<br>
you'll become capable of posthuman politics.
<br>
<p>Chief among your idols is the notion of &quot;Law&quot; in your
<br>
head (which you sometimes capitalize in the way
<br>
Mormons, Muslims, etc. capitalize &quot;God,&quot; &quot;Allah,&quot; etc.)
<br>
<p>I have provided you with references on how to clear
<br>
these idols from your mind, namely:
<br>
&quot;Clear-Your-Mind Reports&quot;
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
and 'Bentham's Theory of Fictions' by C.K. Ogden.
<br>
<p>The following may also assist you:
<br>
---------------------------------------------------
<br>
The Idols of Human Understanding
<br>
by Francis Bacon (condensed and edited):
<br>
&quot;The idols and false notions which are now in
<br>
possession of the human understanding, and have
<br>
taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's
<br>
minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but
<br>
even after entrance obtained, they will again
<br>
in the very instauration of the sciences meet
<br>
and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of
<br>
the danger, fortify themselves as far as may be
<br>
possible against their assaults.
<br>
<p>There are four classes of idols which beset
<br>
men's minds. To these, for distinction's sake,
<br>
I have assigned names:
<br>
Idols of the tribe;
<br>
Idols of the cave;
<br>
Idols of the marketplace;
<br>
Idols of the theater.
<br>
<p>The idols of the tribe have their foundation in
<br>
human nature itself, and in the tribe, race, and
<br>
culture of men. It is a false assertion that the
<br>
measure of man is the measure of things. On the
<br>
contrary, all perceptions as well as the sense
<br>
of the mind are according to the measure of the
<br>
individual and not according to the measure of
<br>
the universe. And human understanding is like a
<br>
false mirror, which, receiving rays irregularly,
<br>
distorts and discolors the nature of things by
<br>
mingling its own nature with it.
<br>
<p>The idols of the cave are the idols of the
<br>
individual man. Everyone has a cave or a den
<br>
of his own, which refracts and discolors the
<br>
light of nature; owing to his personal and
<br>
peculiar nature; or to his education and
<br>
conversation with others; or to the reading
<br>
of books, and the authority of those whom he
<br>
esteems and admires; or to the differences of
<br>
impressions, accordingly as they take place
<br>
in a mind preoccupied and predisposed, or in
<br>
a mind indifferent and settled; or the like.
<br>
So that the spirit of man (according as it is
<br>
meted out to different individuals) is in fact
<br>
a thing variable and full of perturbation, and
<br>
governed as it were by chance. Whence it was
<br>
well observed by Heraclitus that men look for
<br>
sciences in their own lesser worlds, and not
<br>
in the greater or common world.
<br>
<p>There are also idols formed by the intercourse
<br>
and association of men with each other, which
<br>
I call idols of the marketplace, on account of
<br>
the commerce and consort of men there. For it
<br>
is by discourse that men associate; and words
<br>
are imposed according to the apprehension of
<br>
the vulgar. And therefore the ill and unfit
<br>
choice of words wonderfully obstructs the
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p>Lastly, there are idols which have immigrated
<br>
into men's minds from the various dogmas of
<br>
philosophies, and also from wrong laws of
<br>
demonstration. These I call idols of the
<br>
theater; because in my judgment all the
<br>
received systems are but so many stage-plays,
<br>
representing worlds of their own creation after
<br>
an unreal and scenic fashion.&quot;
<br>
<p>Jonathan Swift ('Gulliver's Travels'): &quot;There
<br>
was another point which a little perplexed him...
<br>
I had said, that some of our crew left their
<br>
country on account of being ruined by 'law'...
<br>
but he was at a loss how it should come to pass,
<br>
that the 'law' which was intended for 'every'
<br>
man's preservation, should be any man's ruin.
<br>
Therefore he desired to be further satisfied
<br>
what I meant by 'law,' and the dispensers
<br>
thereof... because he thought nature and reason
<br>
were sufficient guides for a reasonable animal,
<br>
as we pretended to be, in showing us what we
<br>
ought to do, and what to avoid... I said there
<br>
was a society of men among us, bred up from
<br>
their youth in the art of proving by words
<br>
multiplied for the purpose, that white is
<br>
black, and black is white, accordingly as
<br>
they are paid. To this society all the rest
<br>
of the people are slaves.&quot;
<br>
<p>In 'The Crowd,' Gustave le Bon wrote: &quot;Civilization
<br>
is impossible without traditions, and progress
<br>
impossible without destroying those traditions...
<br>
no example could better display the power of
<br>
tradition on the mind of crowds. The most
<br>
redoubtable idols do not dwell in temples, nor
<br>
the most despotic tyrants in palaces; both the
<br>
one and the other could be broken in an instant.
<br>
But the invisible masters that reign in our
<br>
innermost selves are safe from every effort at
<br>
revolt, and only yield to the slow wearing away
<br>
of centuries...
<br>
<p>The precise moment at which a great belief is
<br>
doomed is easily recognizable; it is the moment
<br>
when its value begins to be called into question.
<br>
Every general belief being little else than fiction,
<br>
it can only survive on the condition that it be
<br>
not subjected to examination...
<br>
<p>The only real tyrants that humanity has known
<br>
have always been the memories of its dead or
<br>
the illusions it has forged itself.&quot;
<br>
-------------------------------------------------
<br>
I intend to publish our debate on BuildFreedom.com
<br>
in the form of a report titled &quot;Posthuman Politics.&quot;
<br>
It may assist some readers to clear idols from
<br>
their minds. In the report I can refer to you as

<br>
refer to you as &quot;Mr. Anonymous&quot; with none of your links. Your choice.
