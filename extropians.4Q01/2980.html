<p>
Just because violence has occurred, and further violence may be necessary,
<br>
is no reason to switch off the cerebral cortex.  &quot;National security&quot; is
<br>
not the root password to the Constitution, and &quot;war&quot; is not the root
<br>
password to rationality.  I am particularly disturbed to hear phrases like
<br>
&quot;If America doesn't retaliate, we'll look weak,&quot; or &quot;A man is chasing you
<br>
with a bloody ax...&quot;  These are not good principles to drive international
<br>
relations.  It sounds to me like this could have been said by both
<br>
defenders and aggressors in every war with which I am even vaguely
<br>
acquainted and probably every war for the last hundred millennia, and I'm
<br>
sure not all of those were good ideas.
<br>
<p>I am horrified when I hear we need to &quot;look strong&quot; or that expressing
<br>
dissent is a threat to your personal survival which therefore needs to be
<br>
suppressed.  These mistakes have been made often enough over humanity's
<br>
lifetime, thank you very much.
<br>
<p>National honor isn't defended by getting a reputation for an itchy trigger
<br>
finger; national honor is defended by having a clear set of consistently
<br>
applied moral principles that other nations can observe to be honorable. 
<br>
Justice which runs slow and formal, but massive and sure, appears just as
<br>
formidable and impressive as an instant eruption, and it gathers a lot
<br>
more respect.
<br>
<p>When someone proposes that America go to war, I want to hear a description
<br>
of which general principles for maintaining international peace are being
<br>
applied, so that I can judge whether these are principles that will work
<br>
to generate a stable world order.  &quot;Remove from power those governments
<br>
aiding terrorists attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction, even
<br>
if it involves harming the captive civilian populations of those
<br>
governments&quot; sounds to me like a reasonable principle, even if it can't be
<br>
applied consistently because some such governments are too big to be
<br>
spanked by the present democratic community of nations.  Even if applied
<br>
inconsistently, this principle still reduces risk.
<br>
<p>&quot;Any nation that is hurt must declare war as revenge&quot; is NOT a good
<br>
principle for international relations.  &quot;When somebody is threatening you
<br>
with a knife, don't ask why, just shoot them&quot; is NOT a good principle for
<br>
international relations.  I would propose &quot;When somebody is coming at you
<br>
with a knife, shoot them, but at least *try* and get the formal consent of
<br>
the Security Council or even the General Assembly first.&quot;
<br>
<p>Not all arguments in favor of a good thing are good arguments.  Even if
<br>
the war on Afghanistan is a just war, that doesn't mean all arguments
<br>
ending in the conclusion &quot;therefore the war is good&quot; are rational.  I've
<br>
heard some damned lousy arguments for the Singularity in my time.  Someone
<br>
who blows holes in flawed pro-Singularity arguments is doing us all a
<br>
service by keeping the ideosphere clean, not &quot;threatening the survival of
<br>
the human species by arguing against the Singularity&quot;.  Irrationality in
<br>
the service of liberty is no virtue.  What I see right now is people who
<br>
want all arguments in favor of the war to be correct, and all arguments
<br>
against the war to be incorrect, and who regard any departure from this as
<br>
a personal insult or even a personal threat.  Very human, of course, and a
<br>
token of normality rather than idiocy, but I'd thought that longtime
<br>
Extropian list members would be less normal than that.
