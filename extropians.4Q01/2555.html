Read the piece&quot;Al-Qaida's Endgame? by Decision Support Systems
<br>
and after giving some thought as to how a terrorist would most efficiently
<br>
wreck havoc especially if they have nuclear weapons....
<br>
<p>-America depends on foreign oil
<br>
-A terrorist from the middle east would not want to destroy their own oil
<br>
producing capacity  only disable the ability of the USA to use it to support
<br>
their economy.
<br>
-Each attack to have the most effectiveness should be both catastrophic in
<br>
terms of economic destruction and human life as well as not a repeat of
<br>
previous ones (for most surprise/fear/terror effect).
<br>
-Let's for discussion purposes assume that nuclear weapons are in the
<br>
terrorists possession.
<br>
<p>What if several oil tankers  are surreptitiosly fitted with warheads.
<br>
What if the origin is not important
<br>
What if several tanker nukes are similtaneously at several USA port
<br>
refineries, close enough to the actual refinery so that a blast would level
<br>
the refinery, as well as decimate the surrounding city.
<br>
-If I were to invoke such a senario it might most likely happen when the
<br>
heaviest petrochemical use occurs... early to mid winter.
<br>
<p>So if I were looking for another attack on the USA it would be between
<br>
Christmas and New year (the real start of the new millenium) and I would look
<br>
for unusual methods of delivery such as oil tankers?????
