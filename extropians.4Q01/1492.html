</em><br>
<p>Yes, but (and it's a very big &quot;but&quot;) one has to look at the actual
<br>
historical workings of the phenomenon to which you refer.  Certainly there
<br>
is religiously-inspired violence in the history of Christianity, with its
<br>
peak in the period from the Crusades to the wars of the Reformation and
<br>
Counter-Reformation, a period of roughly 600 years.  The pacification of
<br>
Christianity as an influence on human behavior since the Enlightenment seems
<br>
to me to be a fact beyond doubt.  The violence engendered by various
<br>
marginal Christian and non-Christian cults -- from Mormonism (sadly no
<br>
longer &quot;marginal&quot; in numbers) with its massacres of non-Mormon settlers to
<br>
Scientology with its monomaniacal persecution of its critics to the
<br>
anti-abortionist bombers and &quot;White Christian&quot; militants of recent years
<br>
with their apocalyptic rhetoric and behavior can't reasonably be said to be
<br>
a major influence on the course of affairs in the West.
<br>
<p>The point of which is to see that Islam in general and its more extreme
<br>
forms in particular are still very much militant forces in large-scale human
<br>
affairs, and far more so than any other religion.  Frankly, I simply cannot
<br>
understand how one could conclude anything else.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Every word of it is consistent with my reading on the subject.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Warning: here comes my soapbox...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm.  It seems to be quite *inconsistent* with what I have read.  I'm no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Muslim, nor scholar of Islam.  However I am fascinated by religious belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and have done some reading in that area over the years.  In light of
</em><br>
recent
<br>
<em>&gt; events, like many people, my interest in Islam has markedly increased.  At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first I was looking for something to support my initial assumption that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam was a religion of violence, not of peace -- like say Judaism or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity.  I have been consistently dissapointed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are of course some suras in the Qur-an which could be interpreted as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling for religious intolerance and violence.  But no more so than what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will find in the Bible, particularly the Old Testament.  For instance
</em><br>
if
<br>
<em>&gt; you examine the verses cited by the ISIS, you will see that they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite as clear-cut as they may seem at first blush.  For intance:
</em><br>
according
<br>
<em>&gt; to ISIS, the Qur-an exorts Muslims to &quot;kill the disbelievers wherever we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find them.&quot;  However, if you actually read the sura in context it
</em><br>
admonishes
<br>
<em>&gt; the believers to fight against the *persecution of their faith*.  Who
</em><br>
could
<br>
<em>&gt; argue with that?  2:191 does say &quot;slay them whereever ye catch them.&quot;  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2:192 goes on to say: &quot;But if they cease, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Merciful.&quot;  2:193 says: &quot;And fight them on until there is no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persecution.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is certainly no worse, if no better, than what you will find in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bible.  Also, the Qur-an does tell the Muslim &quot;take not Jews and
</em><br>
Christians
<br>
<em>&gt; for your friends and protectors.&quot;  But this is not any worse than Old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Testament admonitions to the Jews to separate themselves from the
</em><br>
Gentiles.
<br>
<em>&gt; And it is not even as divisive or inflammatory as Jesus' own reference to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gentiles as &quot;dogs&quot; (Matthew 15:26).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, I'd take what ISIS says about the teachings of Islam with a
</em><br>
grain
<br>
<em>&gt; of salt.  They refer to themselves as freethinkers with &quot;Islamic roots.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This does not mean that they are necessarily learned in the teachings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam.  To the contrary, it implies that they are &quot;cultural&quot; Muslims, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many in the West who live like atheists but call themselves &quot;Christian.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My readings, apparently unlike yours, lead me to believe that the Qur-an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocates the use of violence only to protect the right of Muslims to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice their beliefs in freedom from persecution.  I have seen nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which suggests that Islam advocates spreading the belief at the edge of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; sword.  To the contrary I have been oft-referred to the sura which plainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states &quot;there is no compulsion in religion.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Zero, I think there is a basic concept at the heart of Islam that you aren't
<br>
seeing clearly, and one that a historical exegesis of the text of the Q'ran
<br>
and the substance of the Sunnah makes quite clear: The call to fight for the
<br>
&quot;freedom&quot; of Islam is grounded in the explicit goal of making Islam a state
<br>
religion.  ALL of the contextualization to which you refer (especially
<br>
surrahs 2:191-193) only makes sense if one sees the admonition to &quot;fight
<br>
until Islam is a state religion.&quot;   The actual historical context of how
<br>
Mohammed's pronouncements on jihad developed make this quite clear: Mohammed
<br>
spoke these words to motivate his followers to fight relentlessly until
<br>
Islam was established as the official religion governing the law of the
<br>
land, and only then to lay down their arms.  The admonitions to tolerance
<br>
are firmly surrounded by the institution of jizia (the tax on
<br>
non-believers).
<br>
<p>One sees the same behavior in Europe toward Jews until the immediate post
<br>
Rennaissance period, and milder forms of inter-sect legal discrimination
<br>
until much later (for instance, the &quot;disabilities&quot; imposed on Catholics in
<br>
the UK until the early 19th Century.)  The basic problem we face today is
<br>
the extreme militancy of a significant segment of humanity governed by a
<br>
doctrine that is PRECISELY THE CONVERSE OF THE 1st AMMENDMENT.  Your
<br>
statement that the items of doctrine at issue relate to &quot;the use of violence
<br>
only to protect the right of Muslims to practice their beliefs in freedom
<br>
from persecution&quot; is, I am afraid, made through the lens of the West's very
<br>
recent concept of separation of church and state embodied in the 1st
<br>
Ammendment and other constitutional regimes elsewhere.
