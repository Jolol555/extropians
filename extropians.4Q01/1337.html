<p><p>I suspect that most folks don't spend a substantial percentage of the
<br>
day reading p=mail. which is the only category of reading matter I'm 
<br>
talking about. The efficiencies gained in filing, routing, and
<br>
retrieval, and averting the productivity loss due to (mostly silly)
<br>
worry about bioterrorism, will more than make up for the slower reading 
<br>
speed. Such a system would also facilitate telecommuting, which saves
<br>
gas and time.
<br>
<p>You are correct that reading scanned text or Fax on the screen is slower 
<br>
for some people, and you are correct that the problem is the display,
<br>
not the scanner. Since the images are static, a display optimized for
<br>
resolution at the expense of frame rate would be ideal. Is anybody
<br>
doing this?
