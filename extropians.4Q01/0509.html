Great post Reason.
<br>
<p>Gotta say &quot;Yeah!&quot; on almost everything you said.
<br>
Just one slight exception:

</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is why the future will resemble the animistic past. We will try to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Had a conversation with some people recently on this topic.
<br>
<p>Many people think there is some internal programming for only a few stories 
<br>
(and some are actually engaged in trying to write programs to classify and 
<br>
create stories). But I think it is a case of the cart before the horse.
<br>
<p>Many writers work really hard to create different stories. Sometimes they 
<br>
hit upon ideas and ways of seeing things that are so different that they 
<br>
become highly acclaimed and their stories are hailed as new and refreshing. 
<br>
Mostly, it is very hard to throw off learned responses and stories end up 
<br>
falling into one cliché or another, but this doesn't mean that we're 
<br>
programmed for just a few of them. Our incredible ability to see patterns 
<br>
in things makes us able to retrospectively see commonalities in what may 
<br>
actually be widely different concepts. (20/20 hindsight.)
<br>
<p>Relating that to our quest for the future: We do many things now that were 
<br>
not only inconceivable in the past but it was unimaginable that anybody 
<br>
would even *want* to. I think the future will bring us new ways of thinking 
<br>
and new desires that we can't yet imagine. (Try to explain the pleasure of 
<br>
surfing to someone in medieval England. &quot;You get on this board and paddle 
<br>
out to a wave which pushes you back to the beach, often smashing you back 
<br>
into the water on the way.&quot;). Many of us are driven to find novelty, 
<br>
whereupon it spreads like a virus through the rest of culture. Afterward it 
<br>
feels like it's always been with us.
<br>
<p>That said, I still largely agree with you even on that point. The future 
<br>
may continue to resemble the past in a number of ways. As you mentioned, 
<br>
some of the most powerful myths are powerful precisely because they 
<br>
resonate with something possibly prewired to feel important.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
