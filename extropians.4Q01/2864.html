<em>&gt; I know there is a previous thread on this, but I can't find it, so if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody minds, I'd like to revisit the question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What degree of cultural engineering is necessary or desirable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should we be satisfied merely with a government that no longer gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe harbor to Al Quaida? Or should we strive for more, like respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for free speech, privacy, elected and accountable government, equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection under the law (in particular, equal rights for women)?
</em><br>
<p>As the 20th century shows, any society so virulently violent will strike
<br>
again if it is not significantly altered in its memetic makeup. It
<br>
worked with Germany and Japan, and to a lesser degree, Italy and the
<br>
rest of europe. It took Russia 70 years of stubborn bullheadedness
<br>
before our 'I told you so' started to sink in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we opt for the latter, are we being cultural imperialists, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is blatantly not consistant with their way of life, particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last item? In such cases, is it necessarily wrong to be a cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOTE: Spike &amp; Mike &amp; Co., please hold your fire. I already know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your take on this is, and it's not without merit, but this question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainly addressed to the Doves. I still want to know what's more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important, human rights or the Prime Directive, and maybe this time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll get an answer.
</em><br>
<p>Heh. I'll refer instead to the Ecolitan Directive (see L.E. Modesitt's
<br>
&quot;The Ecolitan Enigma&quot;) to turn the words of a leftie against the left.
<br>
<p>&quot;Your right to swing your fist ends at my nose&quot;. This can apply
<br>
collectively to collectivist societies. A country that initiates force
<br>
absent of any pan-cultural standards is asking to be rehabilitated.
<br>
<p>The difficulty, of course, is that Afghanistan, for all of its brutality
<br>
toward women, is a very chaotic place. Not very totalitarian in fact,
<br>
merely in fantasy, so holding everyone responsible as individuals is not
<br>
necessarily a good idea. S. Andrew Swann's planet Bakunin reminds me a
<br>
bit of it, if sprinkled with goats milk, Allah, and opium.
<br>
<p>Rather, what needs rehabilitating is not the people, but the memes which
<br>
infect them. They can be looked at as innocents in all of this, as much
<br>
as any victim of the plague or smallpox. Treating Afghan society as an
<br>
epidemic, rather, that needs tight quarrantine controls along with
<br>
generous doses of anti-memetic counter-programming in the form of
<br>
information, technology, and development assistance, along with a
<br>
generous dose of education of Enlightenment philosophy and the
<br>
prohibition of Wahhabis from the country.
