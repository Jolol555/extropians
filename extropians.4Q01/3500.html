</em><br>
<p>By 1918 (or 1991) the German (or Iraqi) military was damaged  beyond repair.  At home,
<br>
this did not mean non-military and  non-militaristic factions reasserting control.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt; In fact, part of the reason the militarists got power in the first place was
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; because of FDR's heavy handed diplomacy with Japan.
</em><br>
<p>FDR was not heavy handed enough, read the book &quot;The Rape Of  Nanking&quot;.
<br>
Japan invaded China and butchered millions years before Pearl Harbor.
<br>
Considering the magnitude of the crime the American response was anemic,
<br>
If the Chinese were blond and blue eyed I bet the outrage in the Western
<br>
World would have been larger and more appropriate.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; So, I don't think Japan would have been ready to go to war again in five  years.
</em><br>
<p>We will never know, but it's not unreasonable to think that they might and after
<br>
4 years of horrible war it was inevitable the winning side would want to finish it and
<br>
take no chances.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; The Soviets were too busy grabbing Manchuria to start an invasion of Japan  itself.
</em><br>
<p>If you said that to FDR or Churchill they would have said baloney, so would I. Years
<br>
before Stalin had told FDR that 3 months after the end of the war with Germany he would
<br>
invade Japan, and the Americans were delighted with the idea. After it became apparent
<br>
that the  Atomic Bomb would actually work and Soviet help was not needed this idea
<br>
seemed less delightful.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Would the Japanese be able to fend off an American invasion but not a Soviet one?
</em><br>
<p>They would be able to fend off neither and there would have been a sea of blood,
<br>
Japanese Soviet and American.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; this [keeping the Emperor] was a minor, last minute concession.
</em><br>
<p>Not minor to the Japanese mind, nothing was more important.
<br>
<p><em>        &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt;It seems to me that with thousands dying every day it was their responsibility
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt;to eliminate baffle gab.
</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt; Without an invasion, how would more US soldiers have died?
</em><br>
<p>I was referring to Japanese deaths. Their own people were dying in huge numbers
<br>
from conventional bombs and a even larger number would soon start to die from
<br>
starvation, this was no time to give elliptical ambiguous speeches.
