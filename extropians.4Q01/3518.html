Robots Birddog Pooping Pigeons

By Daithí Ó hAnluain
<br>
&nbsp;CORK, Ireland -- A barrage of bird guano has inspired two 18-year-old student
<br>
engineers from Northern Ireland to develop a tech high-wire act to stop
<br>
pigeons' stools.
<br>
<p>Dazed, dazzled and highly addled birds could become a feature of Northern
<br>
Ireland's landscape if their recently invented robot is developed
<br>
commercially.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The guano-buster, called a Self-Sustained Induction Deferrer (SID),
<br>
precariously patrols high-voltage wires to prod starlings and other birds from
<br>
their perch. Bird guano is an environmental menace, and Northern Ireland
<br>
Electricity (NIE), which sponsored the research, receives up to 40 complaints
<br>
a month.
<br>
<p>The poop is essentially a semi-solid concentrated form of urine known as uric
<br>
acid, which wreaks havoc on stone and car paint and can even discolor bronze.
<br>
In Vienna, Austria, nets are employed on bronze monuments to protect the
<br>
ancient artworks.
<br>
<p>Guano also creates a hygiene risk. &quot;Birds are very, very efficient carriers
<br>
and vectors of disease,&quot; said Dr. Tom Kelly, college lecturer at the
<br>
Department of Zoology in University College Cork.
<br>
<p>&quot;For example, they are very efficient vectors of influenza. It's possible that
<br>
a bird could transmit influenza to a human. And because they can fly over huge
<br>
distances they can carry these agents with them. One incident, for example,
<br>
was in the Antarctic where influenza among researchers was attributed to the
<br>
arrival of migratory birds.&quot;
<br>
<p>Birds can also be a menace physically. In Florida, turkey vultures have
<br>
damaged Low Level Windshear Alert Systems (LLWAS) close to Fort Myers Airport,
<br>
and they pose a constant threat to aircraft. Birds have been responsible for
<br>
bringing down aircraft -- they were cited as a possible cause of the recent
<br>
American Airlines Flight 587 crash in New York two weeks ago.
<br>
<p>The students' solution is a robot that clasps onto high wires and trundles
<br>
along, prodding birds off the lines. It's armed with a stroboscopic light and
<br>
a loud siren designed to daunt the most shiftless and sanguine of starlings.
<br>
<p>The really clever bit is the power source. The duo dismissed the inconvenience
<br>
of frequently replacing batteries, and in Ireland solar power was strictly a
<br>
non-starter. Instead the device uses electric induction to get power from the
<br>
high-voltage wires themselves. It does this by turning itself into a large
<br>
split current transformer in combination with the power line.
<br>
<p>Judges in the recent Young Engineers for Britain competition were so impressed
<br>
they made the device the overall winner. Now it's undergoing further tests and
<br>
refinements to see if it's effective in real life. Their achievement is all
<br>
the more remarkable given their tender age when they first looked into the
<br>
project -- just 17.
<br>
<p>&quot;I was searching about for a suitable project for the Northern Ireland Young
<br>
Engineers competition about two years ago,&quot; says Kieran McGeown, head of the
<br>
technology department at St. Patrick's College and mentor for the project. &quot;I
<br>
discussed my needs with (Northern Ireland Electricity) and they gave me the
<br>
challenge of the design brief vis-à-vis the birds.&quot;
<br>
<p>The school is no stranger to birds or tech competitions. In 2000, another St.
<br>
Patrick's team won the Northern Ireland Young Engineers competition with a
<br>
wireless device that monitors the core temperature of cooking chickens.
<br>
<p>&quot;We looked at what (bird deterrents were) available at the time,&quot; says Brendan
<br>
Quinn, 18, who now attends Queens University, Belfast. &quot;We found out what
<br>
worked and what didn't and we based our final design on that.&quot;
<br>
<p>Partner Enda Young takes up the story: &quot;We broke down available products into
<br>
physical, audio and visual. We had intended to put spikes on the SID, and we
<br>
may do it in the future. We're also looking at making it wireless, so
<br>
engineers can send it to the end of the line if they need to do any repairs or
<br>
whatever.&quot;
<br>
<p>But it still has to prove itself. &quot;The problem is habituation. At the end of
<br>
the day, birds are clever and they learn very quickly if something is not a
<br>
threat,&quot; said Kelly. There are worries that the jaded birds of Northern
<br>
Ireland might quickly become bored with the boisterous newcomer.
<br>
<p>While the students recognize the ability of birds to habituate themselves,
<br>
they believe their robots' movement along the line will prove sufficiently
<br>
effective. &quot;We've experimented with a starling distress call, the stroboscopic
<br>
light and a siren, but we think the robot's movement along the line will chase
<br>
them away,&quot; said Young.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, tests will continue and their project will be representing
<br>
Ireland at The World Science and Technology Fair, to be held in Louisville,
<br>
Kentucky, in May 20, 2002.
