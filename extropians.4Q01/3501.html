<p><em>&gt;Not neccessarily. It's worth thinking about this from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viewpoint of realpolitik/raison d'etat. If people attack you you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to know what their beef is so you can calculate the relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost of 1. Killing them, 2. giving them what they want 3. giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them some of what they want but making it clear that's all they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to get. If giving your enemy what they want is too costly (a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;threat to some vital interest or the existence of the state) then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you accept the cost of killing them. 
</em><br>
<p>Al-Quaeda performed this calculation for us. After refusing their
<br>
argument ad baculum, they attacked us, leaving destroying them as
<br>
the best option.
<br>
<p>The Al-Quaeda/Taliban narrative was that U.S. &quot;interventionism&quot; was
<br>
bad for Muslims, completely ignoring U.S. interventionism in both
<br>
Kosovo and Kuwait on behalf of Muslims.
<br>
<p>The war has already demonstrated the Al-Quaeda/Taliban narrative
<br>
wrong, the Afghans are better off now, after U.S. intervention,
<br>
then they were under Taliban/Al-Quaeda rule.
<br>
<p>Which is why the former demonstrations have disappeared.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If the cost balance works out the other way you make a deal -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this is what the British government has done with IRA/Sinn Fein.
</em><br>
<p>The long British occupation of Northern Ireland is another matter,
<br>
best left to a seperate thread.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Why not ? Clearly Israel is not going to make a deal because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(realistically) sees that as a threat to its existence (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;above). However you need to ask - is a threat to Israel a threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of equivalent severity to the national interest of the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt;States ? If it is then how is it ? I can see a case for arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the loss of the oil under Saudi would be a devastating blow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to U.S. interests but doesn't supporting Israel make that outcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more likely ? (My own view is that the House of Saud is past its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sell-by date and won't survive much longer. Raison d'etat would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lead the U.S. to support the regime for as long as possible, say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for 8-10 years, while sorting alternative sources of energy). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point is the world is probably safer if people act on the basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Prince rather than moralistic arguments. Steve Davies
</em><br>
<p><p>You'll find me in the other camp, doing what I think is right
<br>
rather than what is necessarily in my best interest. (Actually I
<br>
think what is right IS in my best interest.)
<br>
<p>I think Israel and Palestine will eventually come to terms.
<br>
<p>I share your appraisal of the House of Saud.
