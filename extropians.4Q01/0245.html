Hoo boy.  Not sure where this is from, but interesting if true.

Bubonic plague genome is &quot;unusually fluid&quot;

<br>
Bubonic plague, the bacterium blamed for the Black Death of medieval 
<br>
Europe and now a potential biological weapon, has had its entire 
<br>
genome sequenced. The genes seem to be &quot;unusually fluid&quot;, readily 
<br>
re-arranging themselves and picking up new genes from other microbes.
<br>
<p>That could mean that more virulent strains of plague might emerge. 
<br>
More ominously, it suggests that enhanced strains might be relatively 
<br>
easy to develop as weapons.
<br>
<p>The bacillus that causes bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis, commonly 
<br>
infects rodents in Asia, Africa and the Americas. But it occasionally 
<br>
spreads to humans, with lethal effect.
<br>
<p>It does so by infecting both insects and mammals. Fleas that feed on 
<br>
infected rodents swallow the bacteria, which infect and block their 
<br>
midguts. The starving fleas feed voraciously, but only regurgitate 
<br>
the blood they try to swallow - along with the bacteria. So plague 
<br>
spreads among rodents, often causing only mild disease.
<br>
<p>If the infected flea bites a human, however, up to half the victims 
<br>
die, unless treated with antibiotics. If the bacteria invade the 
<br>
lungs of such patients, and they cough them out, nearby people may 
<br>
catch &quot;pneumonic&quot; plague. This is always fatal without treatment.
<br>
<p>Pneumonic plague is the form feared as a potential biological weapon, 
<br>
as it can be released as an aerosol and can spread directly among 
<br>
humans, without the intervention of fleas. The Soviet Union developed 
<br>
such a plague weapon.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Pathogenicity islands&quot;
<br>
<p><p>The gene sequence of Yersinia pestis, produced by Julian Parkhill of 
<br>
the Sanger Centre in Cambridge, UK and colleagues, shows how the 
<br>
bacillus learned to infect both insects and mammals.
<br>
<p>It picked up genes directly from baculoviruses that infect insects, 
<br>
including one for a toxin that damages the midgut. It also acquired 
<br>
&quot;pathogenicity islands&quot;, assemblages of genes from other bacteria 
<br>
that help cause human disease.
<br>
<p>The sequence also reveals novel surface molecules, which might 
<br>
provide new ways to attack plague. But &quot;this genome displays unusual 
<br>
fluidity,&quot; comment Stewart Cole and Carmen Buchreiser in Nature, 
<br>
where the genome is published. Numerous Yersinia genes have been 
<br>
copied backwards and have swapped positions within the genome, 
<br>
sometimes creating different variants in the same population.
<br>
<p>These recombinations could mean differences in virulence in a single 
<br>
batch of plague, they note. That could also mean that the bacteria - 
<br>
or bioweapons developers - have the genes at their disposal for new 
<br>
and potentially nastier strains of disease.
