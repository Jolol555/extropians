James Rogers:
<br>
<em>&gt;Just to throw a little more gas on the fire, last Tuesday the Turkish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authorities busted some guys trying to sell a couple kilos of weapon grade
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fissionables smuggled in from Russia. The really bad part is that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the *18th* bust in the last few years in which the Turks have recovered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weapon grade fissionables on the black market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        One has to wonder how many they DIDN'T catch.
</em><br>
<p><p>The Turkish would have to appear in the picture at some point soon because
<br>
they are part of the tinderbox. The Greeks were seriously near war with them
<br>
only three years ago (in 1998, the Turks stole one of their islands.)
<br>
<p>The Greeks and Turks are another terrible story. Four hundred years (!)
<br>
of Turkish occupation until only about 100 years ago makes the animosity
<br>
by the Greeks toward their neighbor run especially high.
