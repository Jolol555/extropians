<em>&gt; &gt; Um, because some of us don't confuse words with violence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Terms like &quot;verbal abuse&quot; beg the question of whether there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is such a thing, and I happen to think there is not.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are harmed by words, that's your problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Children can be verbally abused, and even some adults.  
</em><br>
<p>I'd correct that to say &quot;40 year old children&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological strength not to be harmed by words, and some adults in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunate situations aren't given the opportunity to accumulate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strength.
</em><br>
<p>Rather that they are encouraged by certain parties/groups/agendas to
<br>
wallow in victimhood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I reaffirm my own declaration that (a) I cannot be harmed by words, *any*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words, no matter how constituted and (b) if I can be harmed by words, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my own problem.  But that's a declaration that I have to make for myself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a default state of affairs.
</em><br>
<p>Its the default responsibility of anyone claiming status as an adult
<br>
citizen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is fair to assume that anyone posting to the Extropians list is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for having some threshold level of psychological strength, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least that of a normal adult - after all, someone posting to this list who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely happens to be 14 years old is probably not in any sense an ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teenager.  So to that extent, if someone on the Extropians list is harmed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the sort of words we've seen being tossed around, it can probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said to be the fault of the person harmed.  Generalizing this to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible words is much more questionable - I think that should take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberate declaration of self-responsibility.
</em><br>
<p>I may be the exception, but I think that its highly entropic to pander
<br>
to those who wish to destroy the 'caveat emptor' nature of the internet,
<br>
to make it just one more medium of promulgating the PC propaganda of
<br>
simpering serfdom.
<br>
<p>As for myself, I really don't care what people call me. When they vent
<br>
their worst invective (as several left reactionaries have) at me, they
<br>
generally harm their own argument and individual reputation far more
<br>
than they prick at my ego. I find such responses highly useful in
<br>
identifying the demonization tactics (and exposing them to others for
<br>
what they are) as well as the hypocrits they are acting as, since they
<br>
will generally excuse themselves from the same rules they whine and cry
<br>
so much about.
