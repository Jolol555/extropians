Subject: Following the Script by Joseph Sobran
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/sobran/sobran200.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/sobran/sobran200.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Following the Script by Joseph Sobran
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this is war, it makes World War II look as quaint as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eighteenth-century pistol duel at 20 paces. Our enemy is not a state with
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; central nervous system we can strike at, but a vexingly decentralized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization. It's a perverse twist on the principles of the free market
</em><br>
and federalism.
<br>
<p>Absolutely - he seems to have read all those management books about &quot;lean&quot;,
<br>
&quot;flat&quot;, &quot;market based management&quot;. However there is a historical precedent
<br>
for this kind of organisation in Islamic history, several in fact, but the
<br>
big one is the conspiracy led by Abu Muslim which overthrew the Ummayads and
<br>
brought the Abbasids to power.  Worth reading up on this - I'm sure Bin
<br>
Laden is well aware of it. SD
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moreover, the 9/11 attack may mark a dreadful threshold. The whole world
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; now seen that the sole remaining superpower is by no means invulnerable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This can only encourage other potential enemies to try their hand. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather like the four-minute mile: as soon as one man broke it, everyone
</em><br>
did.It no longer seemed the outer limit of human achievement. From now on we
<br>
must watch our backs everywhere on earth.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
For me this is the really scary part of the attack. These hijackers have
<br>
shown just how vulnerable a modern great power is to a small group of
<br>
organised, determined people with no scruples. Many other people must have
<br>
thought &quot;We could do something like that&quot;. It's not only the U.S. that has
<br>
to worry either. There are many potential terrorist groups out there, often
<br>
with the same kind of decentralised, hard to penetrate, organisation Al
<br>
Queida has (eg animal rights activists, deep green ecologists, neo
<br>
fascists). Suddenly the balance of power between governments and organised
<br>
but destructive groups has shifted away from governments. The key fact is
<br>
the extreme centralisation of modern industrial civilisation and the way its
<br>
technology and systems organisation is highly vulnerable to disruption. The
<br>
answer surely, (as people have said in other threads) is to develop
<br>
technologies and organisational systems which encourage decentralisation and
<br>
multicentredness. This could have all sorts of beneficial side effects.
