<p>&lt;&lt;Most Italians are not anti-American,
<br>
&lt;&lt;and they are pro &quot;war against terror&quot;.
<br>
&lt;&lt;But the other side (&quot;not in my name&quot;)
<br>
&lt;&lt;made a very big noise, yesterday.
<br>
&lt;&lt;<a href="http://europe.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/11/10/gen.rome.rallies/index.html">http://europe.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/11/10/gen.rome.rallies/index.html</a>&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It comes down to what the Muslims have been telling each other at their 
<br>
Wahabbi-financed universities. One thing is that &quot;the West will soon fall.&quot; I 
<br>
am guessing this feature, along with ongoing conflicts, along with 
<br>
indoctrination to commit murder-suicides, and so forth, contributed to the 
<br>
September 11th massacres. Now, while the USA has a full head of steam, 
<br>
despite the expected halfhearted &quot;support&quot; from elsewhere in the world, 
<br>
demands the American people to push back this Islamist view of reality. 
<br>
<p>This in the words of Patton, &quot;will make the other poor bastard die for his 
<br>
country.&quot; What good is this? Perhaps a less irrational world, if you hold 
<br>
that many religious fundamentalists are irrational, for no other reason.
<br>
<p>Beyond that, it appears that there are opportunities, once these major issues 
<br>
get settled about terrorist violence, is for a new economic technological 
<br>
infrastructure, World-Wide. One, perhaps, that is easier on the environment, 
<br>
one that fosters, not merely, communication, but understandings among people, 
<br>
where it possibly can.
<br>
What will result is not a perfect world, simply a better one. That is, if 
<br>
we're smart.
