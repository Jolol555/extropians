<em>&gt; &gt;I don't know, I've thought about Pearl Harbor, WTC and far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;horrific events a fair bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The US carried out terrorist acts against American Indians for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;well over a century.  I'm sure that a number of these, considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;individually, were remotely close to WTC, perhaps even worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You needn't stretch to find worse US parallels.  Dresden, Hiroshima,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Nagasaki were all straight-up terrorist acts - trying to force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action onto governments/societies by killing civilians in areas of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimal military importance.
</em><br>
<p>Quite. However, a proper examination of the Dresden incident,
<br>
specifically, will show that the US only bombed the rail yards. It was
<br>
the British who had firebombed the whole city the night before with HE
<br>
then incindiaries, and they did so because they wanted to &quot;beat us to
<br>
it&quot;. While the US has some blame, the overwhelming blame belongs
<br>
specifically to european sources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (What the US did to the Amerinds was horrible and frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genocidal.  I consider it a stretch because it was so long ago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and because few Americans would attempt to justify it today.)
</em><br>
<p>Similar to my clarification above, 75% of the deaths of amerinds from
<br>
disease occured prior to the British arrival, and 90% occured prior to
<br>
the establishment of the US government. Wholly 100% occured prior to the
<br>
acceptance of the germ theory of disease in western heath science.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I don't regard Hiroshima or Nagasaki to be primarily
<br>
terrorist acts. By late in the war, both the German and Japanese
<br>
governments had so thoroughly mobilized and armed their societies in
<br>
preparation for invasion of their home territories that the only people
<br>
there that could be considered 'non-combatants' under the Geneva
<br>
Conventions were those in POW camps and patients in hospitals.
<br>
<p>Under the Geneva Conventions, when a combatant hides behind
<br>
non-combatants or in non-combatant facilities, those then become
<br>
combatant targets as well, legally.
