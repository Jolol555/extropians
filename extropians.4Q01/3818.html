<p>Do you have any reason for thinking this hasn't already happened and
<br>
is there any reason to be upset if it had? If you were copied and
<br>
murdered last night would you feel one bit different today? What

<br>
<p><p>Yes, there is a reason to suspect it has not happened, as there is no
<br>
evidence to suggest it has.  How do you know your best friend was not
<br>
replaced by a shape shifting alien?  Just because you see no evidence
<br>
proving he has not (as that is impossible) it does not make a reasonable
<br>
assumption to assume he has, simply because it exists in the realm of the
<br>
possible.  
<br>
<p>In any case, the points you make I have already discussed in my previous two
<br>
responses,  
<br>
<p>1st, how do I know I havent already been copied?  Which my response to is
<br>
basically identical to the 'How do you know you were not copied while you
<br>
slept' question.
<br>
<p>&quot; &quot;But to continue the argument, how can you be sure that you don't die
<br>
every
<br>
night when you go to sleep and that the conscious being who awakes the next
<br>
morning is not a copy with the same memories?&quot; &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I cant say for sure, as I can not prove something that by definition can
<br>
not
<br>
be tested.  How can you be sure there isnt an invisible dragon living in
<br>
your garage?  You cant prove negatives or things that by definition exist
<br>
outside the realm of testability.  But science offers an answer in the form
<br>
of Occam's razor.  When I go to sleep, my nueral pattern and atomic
<br>
arrangement is not destroyed, then copied and placed into a similiar body.
<br>
If my nueral pattern is not destroyed or affected, then it is reasonable to
<br>
assume that I am the same me that went to sleep the night before.  How do I
<br>
know I wasnt destroyed and recreated?  How do I know that the very passage
<br>
of time is not a continual process of destruction and copying of me?  You
<br>
cant, but there is no evidence to suggest either as the simplest
<br>
explanation.  At the plank length and time, as I mentioned in my post, space
<br>
time exists in no smaller intervals and transversing them thus means that
<br>
sub
<br>
atomic particles are continually quantum teleporting through these energy
<br>
barriers.  If part of concioussness is rooted in a quantum effect, this may
<br>
definately deserve some consideration.  Likely though it is rooted in the
<br>
pattern of the microscopic atoms, and not the sub miscroscopic particles.
<br>
Changing the sub microscopic particulate makeup of an atom through quantum
<br>
passage through space-time has no bearing on the atom or its effect, let
<br>
alone the patterns of millions of atoms formed into a network of billions
<br>
and
<br>
billions of nuerons.  
<br>
<p>If, every night, people could be observed to spontaneously dissapear then
<br>
reappaear a few moments later, such philosophical musing might require
<br>
consideration, but since people do not do such things, it is reasonable and
<br>
scientific to assume that the person who went to sleep is the same one who
<br>
woke up.  &quot;
<br>
<p>And, 2nd you said &quot;all your atoms are in a constant state of flux, you
<br>
really aren't the man you were a year ago&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, I am not made of the same atoms, but as I pointed out in my original
<br>
message on identity, the RATE of the replacement is the key difference.  My
<br>
atoms are replaced over a wide spanse of time, and at any given time the
<br>
majority of the physiological mechanism that makes up my brain and my
<br>
conscioussness is unaffected.  If you compare the differece between
<br>
replacing one nueron at a time with a hardware equivalent vs. replacing ALL
<br>
of them through a destructive scanning method, it become obvious that there
<br>
is quite a functional difference between then two.  Surely you dont think
<br>
replacing ONE nueron of 100 billion billion nuerons has the same effect as
<br>
replacing 100 billion billion nuerons while destroying the original nuerons.
<br>
<p><p>I also addressed this key difference in both of my messages...
<br>
<p>&quot;An alternative to consider would be what I laid out in my original post.
<br>
That replacing only a few nuerons or atoms at a time in an overall nueral
<br>
pattern could not be said to effect continuity of conscioussness like
<br>
destroying and copying ALL of them simaltaneously would be.  Keep the number
<br>
of nuerons being replaced low, and the question becomes worthless.  The
<br>
human brain loses numerous nuerons every day and grows a few every year.  So
<br>
to me this would provide a good guideline to follow, and in the interim
<br>
(while waiting for these nuerons to be replaced) one should take diligent
<br>
care to protect the physiological housing of thier conscioussness.&quot;
<br>
<p>AND...
<br>
<p>&quot;The macroscopic analogy of this would be replacing all neurons at the same
<br>
time with a copy of that neural pattern or replacing one neuron at a time
<br>
over a great length of time.  These two effects would, I feel, be quite
<br>
different.  Is it still me if one neuron is replaced with a synthetic
<br>
hardware neuron?  I think so, but what if I replace 10, 100, or 10^4 or 10^5
<br>
neurons?  At  what point do we have to start considering the possibility
<br>
that it is not me but a copy of me.  Surely if only one neuron were  *not*
<br>
replaced and the rest were with a copy, then that should be considered a
<br>
copy of me, as 1 neuron is not enough to house my  consciousness.  
<br>
<p>Should my neural net be slowly replaced one neuron at a time, I would not
<br>
consider this any loss to the continuity of  consciousness, and, at least
<br>
with my knowledge of the subject, I would consider this to indeed be *me*  
<br>
<p>Once my neural net is replaced by hardware though, an entirely different
<br>
scenario comes into play.  I think, in the short time I  have spent thinking
<br>
about this, that a sort of 'distributed processing' would be utilized, once
<br>
your neurons have been replaced  by a hardware version on neuron at a time,
<br>
a copy could be made of your neural net, also one neuron at a time, and your
<br>
neural  net could slowly start to communicate, one neuron at a time, with
<br>
this copy.  Thus distributing your consciousness over two  hardware copies,
<br>
without (in my opinion) having to worry about the loss of continuity of
<br>
consciousness.  This could be expanded  to multiple copies with your
<br>
consciousness randomly distributed across multiple copies of your original
<br>
neural net.  If this is  the case, and no one copy of your neural net houses
<br>
more than say... 5% of your total conscious processes then damage to any
<br>
one particular net will not result in your death while still maintaining
<br>
continuity of consciousness.&quot;
<br>
<p>But the key question remains, which seems to be ignored...
<br>
<p>&quot;....  If we copied your nueral pattern
<br>
and created a duplicate of it, while still keeping you intact, and woke you
<br>
both up, what would happen?  If we took your copy into another room, would
<br>
you be experiencing subjectively what your copy was?  I doubt it.  Therefore
<br>
the copies 'waking up' and continuity of concsiousness is different and
<br>
isolated from yours.&quot;
<br>
