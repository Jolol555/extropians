Those who have been stimulated by Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick will 
<br>
enjoy this interview at Liberty Books. His latest book, Invariances, sounds 
<br>
like his usual wide-ranging brain tonic.
<br>
<p>Some of use were disappointed by his apparent complete abandonment of the 
<br>
libertarian views that he was so academically famous for, from Anarchy, 
<br>
State, and Utopia. It's therefore good to read in this interview that he 
<br>
was misunderstood and never actually become a libertarian &quot;apostate&quot;. In 
<br>
fact, he seems to take a stance much like my own, which is that he strongly 
<br>
resonates and agrees with a libertarian approach, without necessarily 
<br>
wanting to be totally committed to any particular view of libertarianism. 
<br>
Here's an excerpt:
<br>

_____________________
<br>
<p>Laissez Faire Books: In The Examined Life (1989), you reported that you had 
<br>
come to see the libertarian position that you'd advanced in Anarchy, State 
<br>
and Utopia (1974) as &quot;seriously inadequate.&quot; But there are several places 
<br>
in Invariances where you seem to suggest that you consider the view 
<br>
advanced there, broadly speaking, at least, a libertarian one. Would you 
<br>
now, again, self-apply the L-word?
<br>
<p>Robert Nozick: Yes. But I never stopped self-applying it. What I was really 
<br>
saying in The Examined Life was that I was no longer as hardcore a 
<br>
libertarian as I had been before. But the rumors of my deviation (or 
<br>
apostasy!) from libertarianism were much exaggerated. I think this book 
<br>
makes clear the extent to which I still am within the general framework of 
<br>
libertarianism, especially the ethics chapter and its section on the &quot;Core 
<br>
Principle of Ethics.&quot; One thing that I think reinforced the view that I had 
<br>
rejected libertarianism was a story about an apartment of [Love Story 
<br>
author] Erich Segal's that I had been renting. Do you know about that?
