In reply to Natasha:

<p>While &quot;suffering&quot; as such is not necessarily connected to artistic genius, it is nevertheless true that creative thought generally involves bridging chasms between paradigms, requiring the willingness to put up with a high level of cognitive dissonance.  A lot of the difference between &quot;mundanes&quot; and creative people is that willingness to accept uncertainty and hold two or more conflicting foci.  Perhaps the artist has a stronger brain/mind constitution, by training, experience or genetically based physiology.  Or perhaps his or her conviction that synthesis and resolution are possible and the effort is worthwhile is a major factor.  I see some clear connections to Branden's work re self-esteem - or to Gatsby, ever convinced that one night he would see that green light...

<p>Re: personality types and culture
<br>
<p>For my entire youth, I fought against the idea that people were products of their culture.  Then, in the mid-70's, I drove a cab for 6 months or so.  While driving, I began to notice that I could predict the driving behavior of other drivers by the race/age/class of the driver, as well as the type of car.  For example, one real hazard in Columbia, S. Carolina during that period were middle-aged, middle-class, overweight black women.  They almost invariably bought the same model of car, a maroon Buick, occasionally a Pontiac, but almost always dark maroon.  And they all drove exactly the same way.  When they approached a right turn, they would suddenly and without warning swurve radically to the left, usually verging two or three feet into the next lane over - a totally unnecessary manuever .  
<br>
<p>After a few close calls, I made sure to look for possible right turn opportunities before I would dare pass one of these ladies.  How was it that they all behaved exactly the same?  I suspect that they all watched one another.  They surely attended the same clubs, churches, etc. and probably associated more with each other than any other group.  I never saw an exception to this behavior.  After that, I started paying more attention to stereotypical behaviors, and, sure enough, I spotted them all over the place.
<br>
<p>Years later, in the mid-80's, I drove a cab again in Orange County, CA.  There, I soon realized that all the problems, the run-outs, driver intimidations, etc., came from a small set of discrete groups.  For example, I had a 50% rate of run-outs from black fares, until I adopted an ironclad policy or money up front from any black passenger.  At the same time, I never had a single instance of an ethnic hispanic running out on a fare in five years, and they were 90% of my customers.
