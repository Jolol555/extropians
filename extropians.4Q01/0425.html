<p>When making comments such as this one, keep in mind the basic
<br>
assumptions behind it.  The reason inheritance taxes were cut is
<br>
that that weath had already been taxed.  An inheritance tax is
<br>
double taxation.  The basic assumption under an inheritance
<br>
tax is that wealth all really belongs to the government but it allows
<br>
people to use some of it.  My assumption is that all wealth belongs
<br>
to the people but we let the government use some of it.  Under that
<br>
assumption, all inheritance tax makes no sense and should be illegal.
<br>
<p>We heard the former assumption in many comments by the
<br>
loser of the recent US presidential election when he kept referring
<br>
to the proposed Bush tax cuts as &quot;spending on the rich.&quot;  But
<br>
that carries the assumption that the then-current tax structure
<br>
made collected wealth the rightful property of the government.
<br>
So collecting less tax was equivalent to spending on the rich.
<br>
<p>We have already beaten this topic to death last fall, but do
<br>
examine the fundamental assumptions behind ones comments.
