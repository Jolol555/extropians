In response and after reading the critique of 'the 12th Planet' I have added
<br>
some nuance to the genre description about the use of outright lies, how if
<br>
you are really successful you get mentioned in www.skepdic.com and the tool
<br>
of 'assumed authority'. :)
<br>
<p>More seriously, I do worry about my brother's need for this type of
<br>
material. The key to it may be in the 'need for awe' that appears in
<br>
discussion from time to time. Here we have an intelligent person who is
<br>
unable to find affinity with a god but by virtue of training is also
<br>
disconnected from science. In my case the awe I feel for the exquisite
<br>
complexity in nature and future potential never ceases to grow (did you read
<br>
my recent poem, Wheeler's Beach?) - the more we know, the more there is to
<br>
know. We both want answers and unfortunately 'answers' can be provided from
<br>
any source, if you have a receptive mindset.
<br>
<p>I mentioned my brother's tendencies to a psychologist recently and he just
<br>
smiled and said 'ah - magical thinking'. It seems that there is a tendency
<br>
towards magical thinking in difficult personal circumstances. My brother has
<br>
some of that.
<br>
<p>It is a shame that there are so many who prey on this misfortune.
