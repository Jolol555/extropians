Anders made this comment (in the Meritocracy thread), but
<br>
I'm relocating it back to the aging discussion for the sake
<br>
of archive continuity:
<br>
<p>I said:
<br>
<em>&gt; Do we have any question that Laura Bradbard from the FDA has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done the extensive survey that Robert Freitas has done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to begin a rational classification of what &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;disease&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Anders replied:
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I think she is basing her statement on a long debate in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community of medical philosophers that has largely reached a conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this. She might not have come up with it on her own, but it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result of quite some thinking. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the problem is that the foundation on which thinking has
<br>
been done is shifting rapidly.  This is pointed out by the recent
<br>
article by James Hughes in the Journal of Evolution and Technology:
<br>
<p>&quot;The Future of Death: Cryonics and the Telos of Liberal Individualism&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.transhumanist.com/volume6/death.htm">http://www.transhumanist.com/volume6/death.htm</a>
<br>
(the site appears offline right now unfortunately)
<br>
[Alternate: <a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Articles/death.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Articles/death.html</a>]
<br>
<p>(Its a good article, I highly recomend it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, Robert is the lone outsider I think most medical philosophers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would regard as badly informed and educated. We might agree with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views and think they make sense, but to convince the rest of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in this issue requires a lot of writing and debating, extending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and refining the ideas enormously. 
</em><br>
<p>I tend to trust that when Robert &quot;surveys&quot; something he does a very
<br>
detailed job of it.  While Nanomedicine does not go into the history
<br>
of some of these concepts in detail, I expect the cited references do.
<br>
Now of course there probably only a few dozen to a few hundred people
<br>
alive on the planet familiar enough with that body of literature to
<br>
discuss it productively, so I doubt the concepts will move forward
<br>
as rapidly as we might desire.  As the Hughes article points out
<br>
the &quot;biofundamentalists&quot; are going to be very resistant to what
<br>
is coming.
<br>
