<em>&gt; I think the basic arguments fall into a number of classes:
</em><br>
<p>Thanks, Anders. If anyone has any ideas, please post them up. I think we
<br>
should put this all together as a sort of FAQ or 'talking points' memo
<br>
for clone proponents to study at length, especially before giving
<br>
interviews or taking part in debates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Threats against human dignity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - By interfering in the reproductive process humans become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufactured rather than just born, and this makes the child subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its parents or whoever is doing the cloning rather than a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent human being. This weakens human dignity, as virtues and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flaws become merely features and misfeatures of the &quot;manufacturing&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might carry over in other spheres of human culture as a genetization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans.
</em><br>
<p>Yet the manufacturing of human embryos already occurs in in vitro
<br>
fertility clinics around the world. What difference is there if the
<br>
embryo has one or two genetic parents? Do you propose that all in vitro
<br>
medicine be outlawed?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - The Kantian ethical idea that humans must be ends in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, and not tools for other ends is sometimes invoked by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting that clones are created for other reasons than simply being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Show me any parent who claims that the don't have their children either
<br>
a) accidentally or b) for entirely selfish purposes of self fulfillment.
<br>
No parent has kids specifically to produce independent beings. Each has
<br>
hopes and intentions of producing the sort of kids THEY think should be,
<br>
and many highly resent letting go of their dominion over their kids.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Threats against identity: everybody has a right to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity, and this is threatened by being cloned.
</em><br>
<p>How so? Are twins and triplets lacking in identity? If this cannot be
<br>
demonstrated, then this is no argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Threats against the natural order.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - There is something inherently sacred or otherwise valuable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural reproduction, and this is damaged by cloning. The damage may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be directed at the people involved, but could affect others who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer from living in a world where aspects of the natural order have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been disrupted.
</em><br>
<p>If 'sacred' is referring to religion, every religion has myths about
<br>
virgin births, and celebrates them as wonderful occurences. Any 'virgin
<br>
birth' that would occur would most certainly be a clone of the mother,
<br>
therefore, cloning is to be celebrated as a wonderful sacrement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Bad, undefined things may happen if we transgress certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boundaries. This may not be divine retribution but simply unexpected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side effects. Since some bad things may be very bad certain boundaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should never be transgressed.
</em><br>
<p>Define the alleged bad things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Threats against society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Risks of social stratification, as the wealthy clone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<p>How does cloning oneself create social stratification any more than the
<br>
adoption of third world babies by rich single parents? Is marriage to be
<br>
celebrated as a means of social climbing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Overcloning of some individuals, possibly reducing genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity.
</em><br>
<p>Given the current human population of 6 billion and rising, some people
<br>
having a few hundred clones made makes absolutely NO reduction in
<br>
diversity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Children being reared by neurotic clone-parents trying to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them the perfect individuals their originals never were. Or the classic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misuse scenarios where mad dictators or cults clone people.
</em><br>
<p>As opposed to natural children being reared by neurotic parents trying
<br>
to make them the perfect individuals their originals never were, which
<br>
occurs already far too often, and is generally seen as the right of
<br>
parents everywhere? Cults? Cults generally prefer their prophets to be
<br>
nice and dead so that the statements attributed to them cannot be
<br>
repudiated. As for the 'Boys from Brazil' scenario, any country that is
<br>
dumb enough to elect Hitler a second time deserves it's fate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         - Risks of using clones as slave labor or second class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens, or the emergence of a market for stem cells and cloned tissue.
</em><br>
<p>I can guarrantee that saying that clones are not real people would
<br>
certainly cause them to be treated as second class citizens and lead to
<br>
slavery and harvesting as domestic animals. The only solution is
<br>
legalization and recognition as real and full human beings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Practical threats to the child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         - Cloning is likely to produce miscarriages and deformities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in humans certain changes might not become apparent until puberty or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later, when the clone is already an individual and will suffer from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>Conventional conception already produces miscarriages and deformities to
<br>
an alarmingly high degree. A significant percent of the population is
<br>
unable to conceive children due to incompatibilities, or refrains from
<br>
doing so due to fears of passing on known genetic defects from one or
<br>
the other parent. If reproduction is truly a right of all people, as so
<br>
many claim, then technology should be used to allow those who cannot
<br>
naturally conceive to have children. To instead claim that some people
<br>
should not reproduce due to natural limitations is a very Arcadian sort
<br>
of romantic genetic elitism, and a denial of the primary characteristic
<br>
of mankind: the ability to overcome natural hurdles with their minds. On
<br>
this basis, any ban on cloning for reproductive purposes is inhumane.
