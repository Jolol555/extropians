<p><em>&gt;You needn't stretch to find worse US parallels.  Dresden,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hiroshima, and Nagasaki were all straight-up terrorist acts -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to force action onto governments/societies by killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilians in areas of minimal military importance.  
</em><br>
<p>Incorrect facts and urban myth in an anti-American sauce....
<br>
<p>It was the British Air Marshal who ordered the bombing of Dresden
<br>
and in fact the first day it was Avro Lancasters (British) that
<br>
carried it out. The U.S. (A British ally) participated after that.
<br>
<p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki were industrial centers producing war
<br>
materials, Hiroshima was also the bureaucratic center and point of
<br>
embarkation for the Southern Japanese Fleet. Nagasaki was where the
<br>
torpedoes used at Pearl Harbor were manufactured and also reputed
<br>
to be where chemical weapons used in Manchuria were made.
<br>
<p>See Richard Rhodes &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot; for details and
<br>
excellent analysis.
<br>
<p>Tokyo was scheduled for the 3rd bomb on the 13th had they not
<br>
surrendered.
