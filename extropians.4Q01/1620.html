Miriam English emailed me with the link and original post by Barbara
<br>
Lamar.  It follows.  Thanks Miriam!

<p>On the subject of weaning from using oil as fuel ...

Worth taking a look for the pictures alone.

<p>Buildings with integrated wind turbines could generate at least 20 
<br>
percent
<br>
of their own energy needs, and perhaps all. They would be more power
<br>
efficient than ordinary wind farms or solar powered constructions, say
<br>
<p>UK
<br>
researchers.
<br>
<p>A team of aerodynamics engineers at the Rutherford Appleton 
<br>
Laboratory's
<br>
Energy Research Unit, Oxfordshire, UK, has come up with a design for
<br>
a
<br>
multi-tower office building or block of flats with wind turbines fitted
<br>
<p>in
<br>
between.
<br>
<p>Curved towers would funnel wind towards the turbines and improve 
<br>
efficiency,
<br>
they say. Preliminary testing on an seven-metre prototype indicates 
<br>
that the
<br>
design could be twice as efficient as a stand-alone wind power 
<br>
generator,
<br>
despite the fact that it does not move to face the wind. Wind speeds
<br>
in
<br>
urban areas are typically about two thirds of those in rural areas, so
<br>
<p>the
<br>
extra efficiency is vital, says the team.
<br>
etc.
