<p>There have been many such thinkers. The problem is that because of its
<br>
relatively high level of concentration, it is far easier for one fanatic
<br>
to distill out their own highly virulent fraction at any given time. The
<br>
advantage of christianity is that because it has a far larger root
<br>
document of mutually contradictory statements, it is far better at self
<br>
cancelling code extracted by a 'high bias filter'.
