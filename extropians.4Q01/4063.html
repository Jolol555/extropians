Lee Daniel Crocker:
<br>
<em> &gt; &gt;I am disappointed that a organization like ExI, which ostensibly values
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;rational thought, has chosen to follow a zero-intelligence policy on
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt;anything.
</em><br>
<p>Are we reading the same set of List Rules? I don't see any mention of &quot;Zero 
<br>
Tolerance in the List Rules. I see this:
<br>
<p>&quot;PERSONAL ATTACKS: We do not allow personal attacks or libelous statements. 
<br>
Those violating this rule may be removed from the List without notice.
<br>
<p>If someone attacks your character, insults you, or otherwise violates the 
<br>
above rule, do NOT retaliate in like manner. Instead, send us a complaint 
<br>
(to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Let's%20be%20clear%20about%20the%20ad%20hominem%20rule&In-Reply-To=&lt;5.1.0.14.2.20011211022652.034c62f0@mail.speakeasy.net&gt;">e_shaun@extropy.org</a>) and take the matter off-list.&quot;
<br>
<p>(I now notice that the phrasing needs modifying. The intention was not to 
<br>
rule out ALL personal attacks, but those attacks by one list member on 
<br>
another. I really am not going to get terribly upset with anyone who wants 
<br>
to call Bin Laden a hairy stupid goat.)
<br>
<p>It seems to me clear from the above that malicious use of ad hominem will 
<br>
be met with a warning followed by suspension. If many people do it at about 
<br>
the same time, all being inflamed by some topic, then we might just put a 
<br>
temporary moratorium on a particular discussion, as we did once before. I 
<br>
don't see anything about abandoning human judgment here. That is a straw 
<br>
man argument. Perhaps E. Shaun said something that suggested strict zero 
<br>
tolerance, but that is not in the List Rules.
<br>
<p>*Of course* rules need to have some minimal subjective judgment applied. 
<br>
The ad hominem rule can be applied without much analysis in most cases. It 
<br>
is stated simply because the possible exceptions can be dealt with as they 
<br>
arise. For instance, if two friends playfully insult each other in a way 
<br>
clearly not intended to cause offense, it would be stupid to automatically 
<br>
enforce the rule.
<br>
<p>As one or two have noted, no one here is a full-time paid list arbiter. The 
<br>
rules are a quick-and-dirty means of encouraging a semblance of civility on 
<br>
the List. If a list rule is violated, the presumption will be that 
<br>
something wrong has been done. But if the apparent violator can show that 
<br>
the seeming violation was really not offensive, and so is not covered by 
<br>
the motivation behind the rule, then I for one am not going to mindlessly 
<br>
impose it. But the burden of proof will be on the apparently violator.
<br>
<p>Clear?
<br>
