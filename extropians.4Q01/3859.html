I question the validity and coherence of the idea that an intelligence
<br>
is going to effectively modify the laws of physics in such a way that
<br>
the world is a better place.  It requires an objective measure of what
<br>
makes the world &quot;better&quot;, and I deny that such a measure exists.
<br>
<p>Particularly if this modification is going to reduce the range of human
<br>
action, it is going to make things worse for some people.  For them,
<br>
the world has become a worse place.
<br>
<p>More acceptable might be a modification which put no limits on human
<br>
action but only reduced the bad effects of nature.  Crops would always
<br>
come in, there would be no hurricanes or floods, drunks wouldn't fall
<br>
off of cliffs.  But then people would tend to get careless and lazy,
<br>
and maybe such a safe world isn't really better for the human spirit.
<br>
<p>It's a strong claim that any agency can make the world better in some
<br>
objective sense.  It's the old Absolute Morality back in a new guise.
