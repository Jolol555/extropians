<p>I very much agree with this.  While I despise unfounded racism and other 
<br>
forms of group discrimination (people should be dealt with on an individual 
<br>
level...not as a group), I also think that there is a need for diversity of 
<br>
culture.  Cultural assimilation scares me whether it is done with the best 
<br>
of intentions or not.  While I don't think that was what Eliezer was 
<br>
proposing in his recent post, such assimilation *seems* (and I stress that 
<br>
word) to be a by-product of some brands of singularitarianism.  I have 
<br>
other problems with some singularity theories, but I will delve into those 
<br>
at some later date.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Our present irrational concerns about race will be

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the individual differences we will be able to create. As we grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apart, it will be all the more important that we learn how to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advantage of diversity and comparative advantage so that the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;races we become will continue to work effectively toward even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greater diversity and creativity as we expand into the universe.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I am wrong, but this seems to me to be far more realistic than any 
<br>
other scenario I have heard.  Whether or not you find this scenario ideal 
<br>
or not is an entirely different question, but if you look at the way 
<br>
history has gone and look at how people are *now* in this technologically 
<br>
advanced age, I have little doubt that races, cultures and other groups 
<br>
will diverge as opposed to converge; if some cultures cannot agree with 
<br>
each other in this day and age, perhaps humanity will be better off with a 
<br>
divergent path instead of a convergent one.
