<p>Hmmm.  A very old-fashioned definition that does not really grok
<br>
the realities of the information age.  It assumes that money,
<br>
property and such are static and that if I take then I have
<br>
taken
<br>
away from you.  In information this is often the opposite of the
<br>
truth.  If I take you still have and my also having makes
<br>
creative innovation and increase of information wealth more
<br>
likely than it was before.  
<br>
<p>I don't know what kind of models will get us from &quot;here&quot; to the
<br>
&quot;there&quot; we can begin to make out a bit down the road.  But along
<br>
the way we need to loosen our grip on some fundamental
<br>
assumptions about what wealth is and how economics works and
<br>
begin to think of how we wish/need it to work to maximize our
<br>
greatest benefit and potentialities.
