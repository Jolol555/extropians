Seeking Ancient Life? Ask the Robot Where to Trowel

<br>
<p>Drawing on a five-year, $2 million grant recently awarded by the National
<br>
Science Foundation, Dr. Meskell and other Columbia scholars hope to bring
<br>
digital archaeology to the desert, including a robot equipped with
<br>
remote-sensing equipment. The robot will trundle through the sand, creating
<br>
3-D images of what lies beneath and pinpointing the most promising spots for
<br>
excavation before the trowels begin their slow and laborious digging.
<br>
<p>That's just one of the digital approaches the multidisciplinary team plans on
<br>
developing. The grant program, which is led by Dr. Peter K. Allen, a professor
<br>
of computer science at Columbia, is designed to bring the benefits of
<br>
integrated circuits, laser scanning and sophisticated algorithms to the gritty
<br>
world of an archaeological dig and the analysis of historical sites in
<br>
general.
<br>
<p>To automate the search for auspicious areas within the extensive site, Dr.
<br>
Versteeg will work closely with Dr. Allen, who has created a robot outfitted
<br>
with a laser scanner. Dr. Versteeg hopes to mount his sensors on this robot so
<br>
that it can pace the desert, revealing what lies below.
<br>
<p>&quot;The robot won't get tired,&quot; Dr. Versteeg said. &quot;It will work all night.&quot;
<br>
<p>The group plans to investigate at least a 4,000-acre urban core at the center
<br>
of the site, said James Conlon, assistant field director of the excavation,
<br>
who has spent one preliminary season at Amheida.
<br>
<p>The robot, which is equipped with a highly accurate global positioning
<br>
satellite system, could make its way through this area, Dr. Versteeg said,
<br>
measuring, for instance, the earth's magnetic field, then moving two inches
<br>
and taking another data point, gradually building an image of the magnetic
<br>
anomalies of the subsurface to find the most promising areas for digging.
<br>
<p>The robot does a much better job of measuring than humans do, Dr. Versteeg
<br>
said. &quot;Normally we would do this manually,&quot; he said, &quot;but students wear out,
<br>
and they don't go in a straight line.`
<br>
<p>Above-ground sensing at Amheida will be accomplished by the same robot, this
<br>
time equipped with a laser scanner. Each scan consists of about a million
<br>
range data points. (Range is the distance the laser beam travels to the
<br>
surface it is illuminating.) Dr. Allen and his group have written algorithms
<br>
that relate this dense scanning data to a set of photographs of the same
<br>
object. These photographic images are overlaid on the geometric models. &quot;We
<br>
take 3-D models and automatically register photographs with them,&quot; he said, to
<br>
produce images that have not just shape, but also intense color and highly
<br>
realistic texture.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
