<em>&gt; That's the key requirement, since a person's home is generally either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only or the largest capital asset they ever acquire in their lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Preventing them from being able to leverage that capital is a great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damper on any effort to create a true market economy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's what I think most critics of capitalism forget. They tend to
<br>
define capitalism in terms of greedy corporate bosses and ignore that most
<br>
capital is in the form of real estate, which means homes and farms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its part of the non-trust mindset. For example, in some former communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries, housing became privatized, but home/apartment dwellers who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now 'own' their own homes are statutorily prevented from being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sell their own property (except to state agencies) because the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't trust them to be intelligent enough to deal well on the open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market (and doesn't trust that most people won't be pressured into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selling for lowball offers to mafioso). Of course, these people wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be intimidated by mafioso if they also had the right to keep and bear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arms, but thats a whole other story (as far as some people here are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned).
</em><br>
<p>Well, in fact, I think gun ownership is an intrinsic part of capitalist
<br>
infrastructure and we ought to remember that America was founded (as P. J.
<br>
O'Rourke is fond of reminding everyone) by religious fanatics with guns.  As
<br>
some of that Puritan fanaticism has subsided, so has some of the awareness of
<br>
the importance of armed citizens.
<br>
<p>I wonder if de Soto addresses this issue in his book.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
