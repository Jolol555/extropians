<p>John Clark writes, quoting Michael F:
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; I can be reasonable sure that when I go to sleep at night I don't
</em><br>
die for a
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; few reasons 1) Hooking me up to any kind of machine that measures
</em><br>
brain
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; activity would never measure any absolute cessation in activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not in normal sleep but it would under deep anesthesia. When you go to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hospital to have your tonsils removed are you the same man when you walk
</em><br>
out?
<br>
<p>&quot;One of the problems with Michael's position is that it is possible that
<br>
normal sleep doesn't kill you, because as he said the brain activity
<br>
continues, but that deep anesthesia does (supposing that in fact brain
<br>
waves stop during that time).&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;His position on identity states that there is a fact of the matter about
<br>
whether any particular instance of consciousness is a continuation of an
<br>
earlier one which successfully retains the same identity.  Certain kinds
<br>
of discontinuities, in this view, break the chain and so the identity
<br>
is not the same.  Other kinds, like sleep or blows to the head, do not
<br>
break the chain.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am in deep suspect of the claim that anesthesia completely ceases neural
<br>
functioning.  But if it does, I still would not consider that a death of
<br>
'me' subjectively, as the two components for a subjective sentient are still
<br>
in place, that atoms that make up the pattern and the pattern itself.  As
<br>
outlined in this argument...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------
<br>
<p>Assertion: Sentience and subjective continuity is reliant on both the
<br>
pattern of atoms and the atoms themselves.
<br>
<p>1 - Sentience and perceptual continuity is reliant on the pattern of atoms.
<br>
<p>If someone took that atoms that made up your mind, and mushed them up, it
<br>
would not pass the Turing test let alone pass as a reasonable representation
<br>
of you in conversation.  Same atoms, different pattern.  Therefore the
<br>
pattern of atoms is important.
<br>
<p>2 - Sentience and perceptual continuity is reliant on the atoms themselves
<br>
that make up the pattern.
<br>
<p>- non-Destructive copying example -
<br>
<p>I lay on a table, a passive scanner determines the precise location of every
<br>
atom in my body, its type, and what neighboring atoms it is bonded to, and
<br>
proceeds to construct a atomic level duplicate of me.  We are both awakened
<br>
and escorted to separate rooms, the 'copy' is asked if he is able to see
<br>
what the 'original' (me) sees, the 'copy' reports that he can not.
<br>
Therefore the copy is not me, as he does not experience, subjectively, what
<br>
I experience.
<br>
<p>- non-destructive scanning with delayed destruction -
<br>
<p>I lay on a table, a passive scanner determines the precise location of every
<br>
atom in my body, its type, and what neighboring atoms it is bonded to, and
<br>
proceeds to construct a atomic level duplicate of me.  We are both awakened
<br>
and escorted to separate rooms, the 'copy' is asked if he is able to see
<br>
what the 'original' (me) sees, the 'copy' reports that he can not.
<br>
Therefore the copy is not me, as he does not experience, subjectively, what
<br>
I experience.  The 'original' (me) is then killed.  
<br>
<p>Is the 'copy' me? 
<br>
<p>- Destructive copying example -
<br>
<p>I lay on a table, a destructive scanning machine determines the precise
<br>
location of every atom in my body while disrupting the information of the
<br>
previous atom it scanned.  Using the collected information, an atomic level
<br>
duplicate is made of me.  This duplicate is then asked if he is the
<br>
original, as far as he can tell, he is.  Did he experience subjectivity
<br>
continuity of consciousness?  Given the information provided in the previous
<br>
two scenarios, it is reasonable and logical to assume he did not.  'I'  the
<br>
original 'me' therefore did not experience continuity of consciousness.
<br>
Therefore sentience and continuity of consciousness relies on the material
<br>
making up the pattern as well, otherwise it is a copy experiencing its own
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>Since this logical excursion demonstrates that...
<br>
<p>1) Sentience and continuity of perception is reliant upon the pattern of
<br>
atoms
<br>
<p>2) Sentience and continuity of perception is reliant upon the atoms that
<br>
make up the pattern
<br>
<p>Then is it reasonable, logical, and scientific to assume that a 'copy' is
<br>
subjectively not me, but in fact a unique individual of its own.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------------
<br>
<p>Subjective continuity could be defined by experiencing things through time
<br>
while maintaining the same pattern of atoms and group of atoms.  If I should
<br>
stop experiencing things for a time being, that does not mean that my
<br>
pattern was disrupted or that the atoms making up the pattern were destroyed
<br>
and recreated.  Both of these later scenarios have real world examples were
<br>
a measurable difference would occur as outlined above.  A gap in your
<br>
perception of time through neural cessation has no real world example that I
<br>
can think of with a measurable difference in person.  That is, as long as
<br>
the medium is kept in tact, if you are anesthetized and then wake up, you
<br>
would still pass a Turing test and nothing has occurred to indicate you may
<br>
have loss subjective continuity.  You would if copied and you would if your
<br>
atoms were re-arranged to a different patter (mush), as outlined above.  So
<br>
I do not see how that demonstrates a flaw in my argument, perhaps you could
<br>
elaborate some more on it?
<br>
<p>&quot;The question is, how could you know that severe discontinuities like
<br>
John's anesthesia example, or severe head trauma, don't break the chain?&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't think you could ever be sure, I would suspect that in severe cases
<br>
of amnesia from head trauma than effectively a death of personality has
<br>
occurred (as depicted in the Harrison ford film 'Regarding Henry') so I
<br>
would do what I could to avoid that.  
<br>
<p>&quot;It certainly won't work to ask the person afterwards if he feels the
<br>
same, because I think everyone agrees that he would say he does, even if
<br>
in fact the chain of identity had been broken.  Someone who was copied
<br>
without his knowledge would say the same thing, and on this view he
<br>
is wrong, his identity is no longer the same, but he doesn't know it.
<br>
So statements and even personal experience are no evidence.&quot;
<br>
<p>Except for in the case of a non-destructive copy being objectively
<br>
demonstrated to not have the same subjective experience as the original.  
<br>
<p>&quot;If you agree that there is no way to tell if severe trauma breaks the
<br>
chain of identity, and even the person involved can't tell afterwards,
<br>
then how confident can you be that ordinary sleep doesn't break it,
<br>
either?  Your personal experience and memories are no guide.&quot;
<br>
<p>Because, as I have outlined multiple times, there is no scientific reason to
<br>
assume that because something *could* happen then it probably did.  If you
<br>
are comprised of the same atoms in the same pattern in the same state after
<br>
sleeping, arm amputation, anesthesia, or whatever else, then for all
<br>
reasonable minds you are the same person.  A blow to the head, if severe
<br>
enough, is a different story, as it could alter the pattern or the state of
<br>
your atoms, as in the case of sever amnesia (does this actually happen?, or
<br>
is it only in movies and soap operas?) 
<br>
<p>again...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------
<br>
<p>I feel I have to delve into philosophy of science a little bit here.
<br>
Getting copied in a destructive manner is different from getting whacked on
<br>
the head and waking up a few minutes later in a few key areas 1) getting
<br>
whacked on the head does not destroy you 2) and the mechanism that houses
<br>
your consciousness never changes.  There is no reason to suspect that I am a
<br>
different person (i.e. a copy) after getting whacked on the head because
<br>
there is no evidence suggesting that is the case.  
<br>
<p>To elaborate a little further, there is a principle in science referred to
<br>
as Occam's Razor, that is 'The simplest explanation tends to be the correct
<br>
one' or it is assumed to be the correct one depending on your
<br>
interpretation.  A prime example is the question of the existence of the
<br>
Universe.  If one is to say that the universe exists and the reason for that
<br>
is that God created the universe, the next question obviously is who created
<br>
god.  Only three logical possibilities exist, 1) that god created himself,
<br>
2) that he was created by another god or 3) that he was always there.  If
<br>
one presumes that the universe must have been created because it is so
<br>
complex, then it would follow that any being that created the universe must
<br>
be pretty complex as well to create such a complex thing.  Yet this just
<br>
moves the goal post back, who created this more complex being?  If you
<br>
assume that God created itself or was always there, then it is just
<br>
reasonable to assume that the universe created itself or was always there,
<br>
in fact, once you add an arbitrary concept when attempting to explain
<br>
something (the presence of the universe) then it makes no difference to add
<br>
an infinite number of them.  For example, saying the Universe was created by
<br>
God is functionally no different then saying the universe was created by God
<br>
who was created by another god who was created by a giant turtle who was
<br>
created by a giant robot who was created by a super alien ad infanitum.
<br>
There is no evidence to distinguish these lines of reasoning, the only line
<br>
of reasoning that is scientifically supported is that the Universe exists,
<br>
and does not require a supernatural source.
<br>
<p>Similarly, saying that while you sleep it is possible you were destroyed,
<br>
copied, and resurrected is adding arbitrary entities to an observed
<br>
situation.  If observed one would find that I sleep through the night,
<br>
undisturbed, no murders, no transporters, no spontaneous flashes of energy
<br>
associated with my body vaporizing.  Since none of these things can be
<br>
observed to occur, arguing that they could have because you cant prove other
<br>
wise is anti scientific, as you can not prove a negative, and these
<br>
occurrences are arbitrary entities not based in any factual observations.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------------
<br>
<p>&quot;Evolutionarily there would be no reason for brains to have evolved to
<br>
maintain &quot;identity&quot; since it has no operational effect in the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am in total agreement with you there.
