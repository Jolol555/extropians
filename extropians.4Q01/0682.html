Is there visual noise in photos similar to communications circuits always
<br>
transmitting and receiving?

Hidden web codes could be linked to Bin Laden
<br>

<br>
<p>A British communications firm has been helping the FBI to decode messages on
<br>
the web which may be linked to Osama bin Laden.
<br>
It emerged today that the Glasgow-based technology firm Iomart has been
<br>
working with US authorities since the terror attacks on September 11.
<br>
Bin Laden is suspected of using a process known as steganography to hide
<br>
encrypted messages in normal internet images and music files, which can be
<br>
uncovered by breaking down the images to their constituent parts.
<br>
In the month since the attacks took place, Iomart has discovered hundreds of
<br>
such files, many containing Arabic dates and names, which could be linked to
<br>
the attacks. All such files are being passed over to US authorities for
<br>
further investigation.
<br>
Many of the coded messages are hidden in pornographic images or MP3 music
<br>
files and would remain undetected if not subjected to Iomart's database of
<br>
information.
<br>
&quot;It is an ongoing process and we are still helping track messages which may
<br>
have links to al-Qaida. It is well known that the internet is a means of
<br>
communication for terrorist networks,&quot; said Iomart spokesman Phil Worms.
<br>
&quot;Our sophisticated system does not just look at the image but it looks at
<br>
what makes up the image to uncover the steganography,&quot; he added.
<br>
The database was developed by Actis Technologies, which was acquired by
<br>
Iomart three years ago.
<br>
Actis founder Stephen Whitelaw is recognised as an expert in the field and
<br>
has often been called upon to trace hidden information on the web.
