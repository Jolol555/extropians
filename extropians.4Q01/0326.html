Umm.
<br>
<p>Anthrax is not a virus. I am not sure about the particle size of all the
<br>
infectious agents (&quot;spores&quot; vs. any other form). The &quot;B&quot; in B. Anthracis
<br>
stands for &quot;bacillus&quot;, and the &quot;course of treatment&quot; is antibiotics.

<p>Absolutely agree with your other comments. Duct tape and chlorate candles,
<br>
anyone?

<em>&gt; NOTE: Smallpox is an amazingly HUGE virus. Do not expect other viral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks (anthrax, hanta, etc) to be stopped by this filter, though it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be able to deal with bacterial attacks like botulin, bubonic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While anthrax can be treated with a vaccine (as can smallpox, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course), hanta has no vaccine at this point, so far as I know. Anybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know different?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hanta can be spread by the spraying of dried dust of the excrement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infected rodents. Don't know if you must ingest the dust itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore: having a gas mask does not protect you against all chemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks. Many, including nerve agents, penetrate through the skin. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are antidotes available for many nerve agents, that typically are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; composed of two injections: a highly toxic anti-toxin, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-toxin's counter agent (if you took the anti-toxin when you were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under attack, you  would poison yourself without the counteragent).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some chemical attacks will include multiple weapons, meant to get you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remove some part of your protective gear (itching and blistering agents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do this) so as to expose yourself more to other toxins like nerve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally: gas masks are uncomfortable. TOO BAD. Take it off and expect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die. With NBC gear on, you do learn a great amount of patience with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sweating, itches, scratches, heat and humidity, tightness, etc. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are a fidgety person, practice by putting on all your gear and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing your yoga meditations for a good couple hours. If anything can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help you attain trance-like states, it is learning to ignore the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discomfort of NBC gear for extended periods.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ALSO: don't just get a gasmask. There are inexpensive sensors you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy that detect the presence of various toxic agents. Not only are they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important for telling you when to put your gear on, but also telling you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it is safe to take it off.
