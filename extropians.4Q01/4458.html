<em>&gt; I don't see why the concept of a bifurcation vs. total sync is so hard to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; two perfect clones from forking, and starting to diverge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So they *are* the same beings as long as they stay in synch, and they
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't dispute any of this.  Just because I think this is unlikely to
<br>
impossible does not mean I don't understand it.  I submit that the
<br>
controlled copy is not a conscious being.  Its thoughts that are trying to
<br>
form are constantly being overwritten with thoughts from the other.  Its
<br>
perceptions are being blocked and replaced with input from the other.  I
<br>
would claim that there is one conscious being and one meat-puppet.  There
<br>
are not two identical individuals.  I would rather be the free-thinker with
<br>
the thought reading devices rather than the meat-puppet with the
<br>
thought-control devices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it rare? Yes. Is it contrieved? Of course. But if you claim the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described conditions cannot occur, you're wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Do you understand that it is currently thought to be impossible to measure
<br>
the exact position and motion of a particle without changing it?  Therefore
<br>
it may not be possible to duplicate every single atom in the environment.
<br>
Random motion, carbon-14 decay, external radiation and the like will make
<br>
the environments subtly different.  If both copies flip a coin, I doubt they
<br>
will always get the same result in all cases.  Not only are these conditions
<br>
rare and contrived, they are unstable to the point of unmaintainability.
<br>
These are like transuranium elements which only last for a fraction of a
<br>
second before dissipating into something else.
