<em>&gt; &gt; Given the circumstances, sealing trials of terrorists until the conflict

<em>&gt; &gt; is concluded, or for simply some time after trial to greatly reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence value of those public records, is a rational measure to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take. It is a bit extreme, but we are not dealing with citizens here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nor are we dealing with anyone who would in any rational way accept OUR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; posession of similar civil rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure I see the vital national security concerns here.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information might come out at trial that wouldn't make the public even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safer, like people's affiliations and histories, the security lapses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they took advantage of, etc.?
</em><br>
<p>In a war, ALL information about a) the enemy, and b) your own
<br>
capabilities, operations, methods, and assets, is to be regarded as
<br>
intelligence information. You may choose to release some of that
<br>
information, but such decisions should be based entirely on the basis of
<br>
its utility in the propaganda war versus the cost of letting the enemy
<br>
know that information, as they would once it is publicly published.
<br>
<p>If, for example, it is detailed at trial what methods were used to
<br>
discover evidence about the planning, preparation, logistics, or
<br>
operations of terrorist attacks, the public record of this evidence is
<br>
then available for the al Qaeda or any other terrorist network to use to
<br>
figure out ways to avoid evidentiary discovery in the future.
<br>
<p>Al Qaeda can determine, simply based on what evidence is used and what
<br>
is not used in a trial, which of their own methods are faulty and how,
<br>
what parts of their network are weak, etc, so they can then devise
<br>
methods to get around those failings in future attacks. It is certain
<br>
that the mere fact that the 911 attack was so successful is indicative
<br>
that they have this ability at intelligence analysis, and have drawn on
<br>
lessons learned from the transcripts of the trials of the suspects in
<br>
the 1993 WTC as well as the US Embassy bombings in africa. If we fail to
<br>
acknowledge this problem and act to prevent them from adjusting their
<br>
strategy again, then we are at fault when the next attack occurs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Human/civil rights only exist de facto when all participating parties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agree they do, regardless of their de theorem basis. If a murderer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't think you have a right to live, then he similarly loses his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right to live. This is the basis of self defense. Similarly, the Taliban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and al Qaeda organizations have denied that human beings posess any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human rights outside the Sharia Law. Hold them to their own standard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We'll just have to disagree here.  If you don't try to live every moment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your own life by your own standards, then what's the point of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them?
</em><br>
<p>You can live your own life by your standards, so I can live my life by
<br>
mine. When you try to force me to live by your standards, I sure as hell
<br>
am going to force you to live by your own standards. The one sure
<br>
defense against rape is to make the rapist enjoy the experience even
<br>
less than you do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That is so obviously the problem. Yet the problem with Lee's argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now is that he is insisting  that our trial system be inviolate, in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the principle of public trials be held sacrosanct, but he is perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; willing to violate his own premise in changing jury selection rules,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rules of evidence, and procedural details just so his concept will work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One more example of &quot;stealing the assumption&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have a reading comprehension problem, Mike.  I never said anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even remotely resembling the idea that I supported the American trial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system as a whole, and I have been entirely consistent on that.  I meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly, precisely, what I said in plain English, no more and no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less.  I'll say it again so you can get it this time: I hold the principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of PUBLIC TRIALS sacrosanct.  Whatever other principles you consider to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the American judicial system are fair game for reform--as long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trials thus created remain open to public scrutiny.  It's about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency, not whatever particulars some document mentions.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particulars can change with the circumstances, but the one, and only,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute inviolable principle is that trials be PUBLIC.
</em><br>
<p>Even at the cost of your own life?
<br>
<p>So you don't mind kangaroo court trials, so long as they are held in
<br>
public?
