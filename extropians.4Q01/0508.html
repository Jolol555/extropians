<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 48'th update of my fly longevity experiments. All bottles
<br>
contain 1/4 tsp citric acid as a standard additive. Here I examine the
<br>
effect of removing the corpses of dead flies at each census. Since I do
<br>
not have access to CO2 gas, I placed the &quot;no corpse&quot; bottles in my fridge
<br>
to temporarily reduce fly movement, so that corpses can be removed without
<br>
live flies also escaping. One fly did escape during the day 9
<br>
census from the &quot;no corpse 3&quot; bottle, but the survival statistics were
<br>
adjusted accordingly. Control bottles were also placed in the fridge as
<br>
well at the same time so as to act as true controls.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population density in breeding bottles is much higher than in the
<br>
bottles I use for longevity experiments. The risk of viral transmission
<br>
would correspondingly be much higher in the breeding bottles. It makes
<br>
sense that the presence of rotting fly corpses may aid in viral
<br>
transmission. However it is not clear to me whether corpses are a risk to
<br>
the few flies in each bottle of a longevity run. Here I decide the matter
<br>
with an experiment. As can be seen in these results, removal of corpses
<br>
has no effect on fly longevity. The variations in survival I attribute
<br>
both to random variations in fly ages at the start of the experiment, and
<br>
random variations in degree of viral infestation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next run I will examine the effect of various dietary fibers on
<br>
longevity.
