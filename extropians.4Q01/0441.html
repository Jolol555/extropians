</em><br>
<p>You are correct, I was referring to modern religious
<br>
interpretations.
<br>
<p>I remeber seeing James Burke on one of his shows ( The day the
<br>
Universe changed) demonstrating an early gun that fired round balls
<br>
for enemies, and square ones for &quot;infidels&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;I would have to re-read my history about Dresden, but I know both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Tokyo and Berlin had military objectives. Hiding your militay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;elements amongst the civilian population eliminates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;protection civilians supposedly enjoy. Besides there was no such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;thing as precision bombing during WWII.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;####  The reason for carpet-bombing entire cities was largely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;soften morale of the enemy, and to extract revenge for Coventry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and London. The civilians had no say about the placement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;military facilities - they were truly innocent. My mother, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;girlfriend's mother - they could have been killed, if the bombs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had fallen a hundred feet closer. 
</em><br>
<p>Retaliation is a good motive in my book, not the best one, but a
<br>
damm good one.
<br>
<p>I know one of the reasons Tokyo was firebombed the way it was, was
<br>
that military intelligence indicated that industrial production was
<br>
a craft industry in Japan. I remember seeing pictures of burned out
<br>
homes with drill presses clearly visible.
<br>
<p>And of course after Pearl Harbor it was anything goes....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;There is a difference between killing enemy soldiers where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;yourself are also at some risk, and deliberately murdering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;unarmed civilians.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;### This is a huge difference, exactly the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;honourable soldiers, and despiccable, callous, dishonorable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;berserker terrorists, true scum of the earth. But what is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supposed to have to do with courage? 
</em><br>
<p>It's a matter of definition, in the tradition I was trained in 
<br>
(USMC) it is impossible for someone who commits dishonorable acts
<br>
such as these to be considered admirable in any way.
<br>
<p>By such tradition it is cowardly to attack unarmed civilians by
<br>
definition. The negative elements of the acts outweigh and cancel
<br>
out any remotely positive act (ethics).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;As I indicated, deliberately murdering unarmed civilians is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;definition of cowardice (and a criminal act) in my book.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;#### It's a apparent that our definitions of this simple word are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;widely divergent. As I indicated previously, my (and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dictionary's ) definition makes no reference to civilians, whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;armed or not.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Since trying to continue a discussion about definitions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commonly used and usually unequivocal words tends to be fruitless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suggest we disengage at at this point, and let each other use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his words as he sees fit.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If anything, let me just mention that I asked a random sample of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my English-speaking acquaintances about calling the 911 bombing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;cowardly&quot;, and I they replied that this usage would be just an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;empty figure of speech, distinct from the primary meaning.
</em><br>
<p>We agree to disagree, besides we ( U.S.) are engaged in memetic
<br>
warfare as well.
