We're arguing about general trends, where there is a whole spectrum of
<br>
situations, so it's probably difficult to establish anything, but here
<br>
are some more comments.

<em>&gt; &gt; isn't it likely that there be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important genetic and cultural self-selection ? Those who stay tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be more traditional and conservative, content with what they have, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not willing to take risks. Those who go tend to be more adventurous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more confident in themselves, more eager to discover new things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not necessarily, because often &quot;those who go&quot; don't have any choice. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, English who colonized Australia were convicts expelled from England.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, many who came to America were &quot;losers&quot; who could not cope with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation in Europe, or (as another example, the Irish) emigrated because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disaster in their homeland.
</em><br>
<p><p>It seems to me that even when you are not successful, there is always
<br>
&quot;some kind of place&quot; for you in any society, but it may be very
<br>
humble, and even quite unfree. People are always eager to dominate one
<br>
another, so if you're not successful they will be glad to manage a
<br>
dominated slot in the society for you.
<br>
<p>It takes some openness, self-confidence, pride and adventurous
<br>
attitude to go, even when your present condition is bad. And if you're
<br>
really dieing, then you cannot even go.
<br>
<p>Of course the case of British convicts taken to Australia is special,
<br>
as it is not a free act. Choosing to leave because you are too poor or
<br>
you don't like life here, on the contrary, is a free act.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So, it could be that the best and the brightest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the ones with the least reason to emigrate.
</em><br>
<p><p>I never said &quot;best&quot; or &quot;brightest&quot;. European elites are much brighter
<br>
that American elites, for example ;-) I'm referring to a disposition
<br>
to embark in the unknown with hope to make your situation better.
<br>
<p>If you consider this disposition as brightness, well, that's because
<br>
you're American :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Christopher Columbus was brave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cross uncharted seas, but was he more confident in himself than Galileo who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never left home?
</em><br>
<p><p>Some risk-taking / self-confidence / taste for the unknown do not
<br>
result in self-selection, but migration does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is it not imaginable that, by successive such migrations, an evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by self-selection happens (both genetic and cultural), such that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can basically calculate the &quot;adventurous index&quot; based on the distance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from central Africa ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the Africans who travelled great distances from central Africa as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slaves?
</em><br>
<p><p>That was not self-selection, but artificial selection performed by the
<br>
Americans based on external properties.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I see where you're going with this, but you've failed to reckon with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative aspects of migration, such that selection pressure may operate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive out the unfit (or less fit) members of a population, leaving the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back home where they have secured good reproductive options for themselves.
</em><br>
<p><p>However good &quot;good&quot; is, it can still be better. You have extra
<br>
incentive to go if your life is bad, but even if it's good you may be
<br>
tempted to make it even better, if that's how your mind works.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Couldn't there be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some kind of automatic hatred for the successful and not traditional,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some negative thinking, and avoidance of responsability (think of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;altruism claim&quot;) explainable by such genetic-cultural differentiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; through absence of migration ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, and it works both ways: Those who hate the successful and non-traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be the very ones to travel to distant lands to set up communes to practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primitivism. As P. J. O'Rourke has said, &quot;America was founded by religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fanatics with guns.&quot; The Pilgrims were not avante garde intellectuals, after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.
</em><br>
<p><p>Some kind of convictions may be for some the support of
<br>
self-confidence. You know that everything will be different there --
<br>
but at least you can rely on yourself, you know who you are, what are
<br>
good and bad, etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Can't you actually correlate riches to the &quot;adventurous&quot; index : the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; farther you go from central Africa, the more riches you find ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite the opposite: The poorest are driven to the &quot;adventurous&quot; task of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desperately seeking sustenance by traveling to distant lands.
</em><br>
<p><p>What I was saying is, you can NOW correlate these things. You have
<br>
self-selection through migration (with the possible pressure of
<br>
difficult conditions), and then success resulting, over time, from the
<br>
selected behaviour.
<br>
<p><p>One obvious OTHER FACTOR (for the &quot;success of the settler&quot;) is that
<br>
everytime you have to REDO something, you have occasion to do it
<br>
better. So when you arrive in a land with nothing established, you have
<br>
to re-think every single thing, and so you question what you know,
<br>
and you make it better.
<br>
<p>Though on the other hand, one could say that you tend to dismiss too
<br>
easily things (like social institutions, or moral conduct, or
<br>
politeness forms) that have grown over time, as you are not able to
<br>
grasp their intricate usefullness when you redesign things from scratch.
<br>
<p>One can probably also witness this occasional shortcoming in the US
<br>
society.
<br>
<p>It may be the source of the impression of naïvety that Europeans
<br>
(French at least) sometimes have when examining American behaviour or
<br>
discourse. There is a fine line between naïvety and freedom from
<br>
tradition / openness to new solutions.
