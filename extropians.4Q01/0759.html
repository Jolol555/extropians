New Field of Neuroelectronics Probes Brain's Reaction to Fear
<br>
<a href="http://www.uclanews.ucla.edu/Docs/2755.htm">http://www.uclanews.ucla.edu/Docs/2755.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Electronic devices to probe the brain's reaction to fear, compensate for
<br>
damaged nerves and possibly halt the degenerative effects of Parkinson's
<br>
disease - part of a new interdisciplinary field known as Neuroelectronics -
<br>
will be among the innovations presented at the UCLA Electrical Engineering
<br>
Department's Annual Research Review.
<br>
<p>A forum in which graduate students present their latest research and answer
<br>
questions from industrial and government sponsors, the event will be held Oct.
<br>
15-16 at Covel Commons, Sunset Village.
<br>
<p>Neuroelectronics brings together the disciplines of electrical engineering and
<br>
neurology. Engineers are using their skills to design systems that both
<br>
interrogate and simulate functions of the human body. Neuroelectronics, or
<br>
NeuroEngineering as it is also known, is part of an even larger set of
<br>
interdisciplinary fields in biomedical engineering.
<br>
<p>A wireless probe implanted into the brain of a rat will provide information
<br>
about how its brain reacts to fear. Although such experiments traditionally
<br>
require the animal to be tethered by a wire connected to a recording device,
<br>
the new wireless design allows unrestricted tests to be conducted in a more
<br>
natural environment, resulting in animal behavior that is more natural.
<br>
<p>Electrical engineering professor Jack W. Judy, who is conducting this research
<br>
in conjunction with Istvan Mody of the UCLA Department of Neurology, said
<br>
these experiments should lead to a greater understanding of fear and possibly
<br>
other emotions.
<br>
<p>Another group working in this field is attempting to correct a vision problem
<br>
associated with head injuries. When the nerve that controls muscles
<br>
responsible for lateral movement of the eye is damaged, the remaining muscles
<br>
pull on the eye unopposed and the result is a loss of horizontal eye control.
<br>
When the eyes are relaxed, the eye with the damaged nerve will deviate inward.
<br>
<p>The device UCLA researchers are designing will use information obtained from
<br>
the other normally functioning muscles of the eye to deduce the appropriate
<br>
position of the muscle
<br>
normally operated by the damaged nerves. That information, in turn, will be
<br>
used to provide the disassociated muscle with the proper stimulation to move
<br>
it into the correct position.
<br>
<p>&quot;The major biomechanical components of the eye constitute a nicely engineered
<br>
system,&quot; Judy said. &quot;Studying this system, which is simpler than that
<br>
responsible for leg or arm motion,&quot; he said, &quot;may lead to advances that can be
<br>
useful when restoring mobility to victims of spinal cord injury.&quot;
<br>
<p>This research is being conducted in coordination with the UCLA Departments of
<br>
Psychology and Neurobiology and the Jules Stein Eye Institute.
<br>
<p>Although commercial products already exist that can reduce the symptoms of
<br>
Parkinson's disease, researchers are developing a miniaturized, long-term,
<br>
deep-brain stimulator to be tested in combination with drugs in an attempt to
<br>
halt the degenerative effects of the disease. This research is being conducted
<br>
in coordination with Marie-Francoise Chesselet of the UCLA Department of
<br>
Neurology and the Brain Research Institute.
<br>
<p>Other areas of research to be discussed include electromagnetics, MEMS, plasma
<br>
electronics, photonics, solid state electronics, communications and
<br>
telecommunications, control systems, signal processing circuits, embedded
<br>
computing systems and integrated circuits, optical MEMS, and photonic crystals
<br>
and microwave systems.

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
