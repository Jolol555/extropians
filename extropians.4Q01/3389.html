Robots Learn Soccer (and the Game of Life)

BY YUDHIJIT BHATTACHARJEE
<br>
<p>Tucker Balch is an unusual kind of soccer coach.
<br>
He rarely cheers from the sidelines, and he never gets angry with his players.
<br>
Instead of shouting or pummeling the air, he leans forward every once in a
<br>
while to punch commands into a computer.
<br>
<p>But then, his team is unusual too. The players are all robots. And while Dr.
<br>
Balch, a robotics researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in
<br>
Atlanta, sees no great future for robotic soccer stars, his experiments could
<br>
provide surprising insights into the workings of human society.
<br>
<p>The robots in Dr. Balch's experiments are nothing more than a few lines of
<br>
software code, gradually taught to play soccer on a computer screen. They are
<br>
computer simulations of physical robots built by Dr. Balch - shoe-box-size
<br>
machines that he has entered in robot soccer tournaments.
<br>
<p>Dr. Balch plans to reproduce his experiments using the real robots, work that
<br>
he says will bring his findings closer to the realm of social reality.
<br>
<p>On the computer, the robots learn to play soccer by executing a random
<br>
sequence of basic moves - running toward the ball, kicking it, moving behind
<br>
the ball, blocking it. For every sequence, a computer program either rewards
<br>
or punishes the robot with a digital signal telling it whether the sequence
<br>
made sense and whether it should be repeated.
<br>
<p>Dr. Balch divides his robots into two teams, represented by little circles on
<br>
the computer screen. Robots on a control team are able to pass the ball,
<br>
defend and attack from the starting whistle; the test team must learn by trial
<br>
and error as the game progresses. And it turns out that the test team behaves
<br>
much differently depending on whether its members are rewarded as individuals
<br>
or as a group.
<br>
<p>Under the first scheme, a reward signal is sent only to robots that score a
<br>
goal. As the match progresses, every team member ends up learning the same
<br>
sequence of behaviors - going after the ball in a solo effort to score. As a
<br>
result, the circles on the screen bunch around a single point - wherever the
<br>
ball is - leaving the rest of the field open to attack.
<br>
<p>Under the group-based reward scheme, all members in the learning team receive
<br>
a reward whenever any of them scores a goal. After several learning loops,
<br>
some of the robots ended up with behavioral sequences that made them good
<br>
defenders. Others in the team evolved into forwards. &quot;Group rewarding produced
<br>
greater diversity,&quot; Dr. Balch said, &quot;and that made the team a winning
<br>
combination.&quot;
<br>
<p>The results may be surprising to those who believe that the pursuit of
<br>
individual rewards - as in capitalism - encourages people to develop a
<br>
diversity of ideas, points of view, goals and strategies to achieve them.
<br>
<p>Dr. Balch is not rushing to extend his findings to human societies, and he
<br>
acknowledges that human complexities - including traits like motivation and
<br>
jealousy - are hard or impossible to reproduce in robotic systems. But he says
<br>
the experiments show that robot studies can serve as a window for
<br>
understanding human behavior.
<br>
<p>&quot;Robots can learn and plan and communicate,&quot; he said. &quot;They are probably the
<br>
best model we have right now for controlled experiments on social systems.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Ross Burkhart, a political science professor at Boise State University in
<br>
Idaho, who has studied the relationship between economic freedom and
<br>
democracy, says there are interesting parallels between the robot studies and
<br>
the way economies work.
<br>
<p>&quot;The goal in capitalism is for individuals to make as much money as they can,&quot;
<br>
he said. &quot;Whatever strategy brings one person a lot of wealth will inevitably
<br>
become the strategy used by most people.&quot;
<br>
<p>Would a group-based reward system in a corporation make its employees
<br>
specialize in different roles like the soccer-playing robots did under the
<br>
socialist scheme? Dr. Andrew Schotter, an economist at New York University,
<br>
laughs at the comparison.
<br>
<p>&quot;Some employees would probably stop working,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't eliminate
<br>
free riding among office colleagues like you can in a team of robots. There
<br>
will always be some people who will take advantage of the fact that their
<br>
individual performance does not really matter.&quot;
<br>
<p>If employees are rewarded individually, Dr. Schotter argues, they can maximize
<br>
their rewards by specializing in a certain role and carving a niche in the
<br>
organization.
<br>
<p>Dr. Roger T. Johnson, who studies cooperative learning at the University of
<br>
Minnesota, believes that competition for rewards pressures people to become
<br>
similar.
<br>
<p>&quot;Cooperative reward systems often encourage diversity,&quot; Dr. Johnson said,
<br>
&quot;because a group can be more productive if its members have different
<br>
perspectives. They offer a wider choice of ideas for problem-solving and doing
<br>
things efficiently.&quot;
<br>
<p>Still, Dr. Schotter said there were too many differences between robots and
<br>
human beings to justify any parallels. For one thing, people don't just work
<br>
for money; they also work for fun.
<br>
<p>&quot;Also, people don't care only about what they are making individually,&quot; Dr.
<br>
Schotter said. &quot;They also worry about how much the person in the next cubicle
<br>
is making.&quot;
