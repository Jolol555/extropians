Google are benefactors of humankind. They should get a Nobel prize or
<br>
something.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Samantha Atkins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Fwd:%20A%20question%20of%20Web%20entropy&In-Reply-To=&lt;007801c190f1$de3de180$d4220b50@Standard&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; It could/should be many times more &quot;adequate&quot;.  I would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to exclude/include at will mailing list archives, portal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pages and so on.  When I say I want only English that should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all I get, it is not necessarily so today.  Quoted phrases are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not always taken as such.  Exclusions do not always exclude.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't looked into it but it would be much more &quot;adequate&quot; if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmatic interface was public so the hit list could more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily be fed to something else of one's own devising.
</em><br>
<p>All these things you will get.
<br>
<p>I don't even bother with exclusions, I think up a discriminant
<br>
additional term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I never suffered from &quot;too many pages&quot;, or outdated pages. I would
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happy for EVERY page ever put online to stay forever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What?  You have never performed a search that gave you hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thousands of hits, most of them irrelevant?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, sometimes I want to find the homepage of my friend John, and I type
<br>
&quot;John&quot;, and I can't find it in the top results. The damn thing is broken
<br>
!
<br>
<p>Seriously, no. I almost never have this problem. I find that the ranking
<br>
algorithm based on link structure gives very expectable results. I
<br>
decide beforehand if Google will help, then if I think it will, it does.
<br>
(This is a thing I love with the Internet : it magically reflects
<br>
expectations. You think of a useful utility ; you reflect that it is
<br>
easy to implement, and that many people would use it ; you can almost
<br>
DEDUCE that it exists. It's like you can search the Internet in your own
<br>
mind.) I don't expect in all cases to arrive straight at the right
<br>
place, but Google gets me into a link structure that gets me there.
<br>
<p>Were it not off topic (but it is !!), I'd ask you some examples of
<br>
failed searches. I think in most cases the reason should be obvious, so
<br>
that you can actually expect it before doing the search. You can send
<br>
some samples to me in private if you want and we can have a look.
<br>
<p>A new thing I noticed is if you make a spelling mistake he will actually
<br>
spot it and suggest another search ! And if/when you use Windows, try
<br>
the Google tool bar, it's great. Oh, and now you can also POST to the
<br>
newsgroups with Google !
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  You have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clicked on broken links?
</em><br>
<p>Of course, but it is rarely a big deal. If the page still exists, I can
<br>
almost instantly find it. Dvorak doesn't like it because he needs to
<br>
update his silly &quot;best links in all categories&quot; page... In the ODP for
<br>
example dead links are automatically checked and removed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I would also be much happier if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low level protocols also included date created and date last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; updated.
</em><br>
<p>HTTP does include the last modified date (and the expire date if people
<br>
care to set it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Accounts go dead and any links to those pages are now dangling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointers.  This is to some small degree an increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disorder.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, OK. But to me it's not the big deal that Dvorak says.
<br>
<p>Also, there are solutions to this. You can start a registry/redirection
<br>
service with stable references, so that someone moving only needs to
<br>
update his entry there. If there really was demand for it, it would
<br>
exist. But there is not, because it is a minor problem and the added
<br>
complication is not worth it. (actually such services exist, but little
<br>
used for said reasons) The DNS already offers such an abstraction level,
<br>
if you get your own domain then you can keep it when you physically
<br>
move.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Again there's an obvious parallel between the Internet and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foreseeable physical word, set free of usual physical limits. In an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropic world, with almost infinite space, energy, and resources,
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people, like web pages, will not feel the effects of entropy anymore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and will just ADD one to the other, without replacing each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the case of Web pages this would not be a good thing.  Much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information has an expiration date implicit to the type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information.  Keeping it all on the open web indefinitely (vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; archives) would be like keeping every newspaper, book, magazine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you had ever seen in your office.
</em><br>
<p>With 2 billions newspaper pages on your desk you would be embarrassed,
<br>
that's for sure.
<br>
<p>I never read the newspapers so I don't have this problem. I do have a
<br>
few printouts of siginst.org around however :-)
