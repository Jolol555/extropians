In a recent post Samantha Atkins called for the creation of a non-violent
<br>
confliction resolution process in Afghanistan. The only alternatives I
<br>
know to conflict resolution processes that are backed by the threat of
<br>
violence are ones that are backed by the threat of economic sanctions.
<br>
I.e., everyone agrees that when there is a dispute, they will not to do
<br>
any business with the party in the wrong or anyone who does business with
<br>
those who are in the wrong, and so on.
<br>
<p>But that doesn't work if some person or group is strong enough and/or
<br>
unproductive enough that what he/it gains by being in the wrong is worth
<br>
more than the lost opportunities from trade. Unfortunately this kind of
<br>
person or group seems to be quite prevalent in the world. Also, it can be
<br>
very difficult to know who is doing business with whom, leading to
<br>
widespread cheating.
<br>
<p>So are there any other alternatives? If not it seems unlikely that
<br>
non-violent confliction resolution processes will work very well in
<br>
Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>P.S. On the other hand, non-violent confliction resolution can potentially
<br>
work in cyberspace. See <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/bmoney.txt">http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/bmoney.txt</a> for a
<br>
system I worked out.
