<p>
Hal Finney postulated a scenario wherein it was possible to
<br>
enforce intellectual property laws perfectly.  He asked if doing so
<br>
would create market conditions for optimal production of IP, and
<br>
supposed that it would.  My initial reaction wasn't really adequate,
<br>
and it did take me a while to realize the flaw in the argument, which
<br>
I now think is quite simple: it presumes that one can measure an
<br>
&quot;amount&quot; or &quot;value&quot; of IP in the same way that one can physical
<br>
property, and this doesn't work.
<br>
<p>People desire (and therefore value) physical goods because possession
<br>
of them increases the number of potential actions available to them.
<br>
There is no _inherent_ value in any physical thing; it is only valuable
<br>
because someone wants it, and people only want things that enable them
<br>
to take actions they want to take.  If I have a house, I can escape from
<br>
the rain; if I have water, I can live longer; if I have a million dollars,
<br>
I can do uncountably many things that other people may not be able to do,
<br>
because they don't have a million dollars.  It is not the paper that's
<br>
valuable to me, it is the potential actions I can take because I have
<br>
the paper.
<br>
<p>People value the same thing differently either because (1) they value
<br>
the actions enabled by property differently (I might value a deck of
<br>
cards more than someone who doesn't enjoy card games), or (2) they
<br>
have abilities, knowledge, or other property that enables different
<br>
actions for them (a Pole values Zlotys more than I, because he has
<br>
the ability to buy food from the local grocer with them, while I
<br>
don't).  This latter fact leads to &quot;comparative advantage&quot;.
<br>
<p>The problem addressed by free trade is this: a physical thing enables
<br>
me to do some things, and it might also enable you to do some things,
<br>
but it can't enable both of us at the same time.  If the house is mine,
<br>
I can escape from the rain but you get wet.  If I give or sell it to
<br>
you, you stay dry and I get wet.  Property rights and free trade solve
<br>
the problem of efficient distribution by enabling us to use comparative
<br>
advantage: if you can do more things with the house than I can (say,
<br>
you enjoy the view more than I do, or you have a larger family that
<br>
the house is better suited to), then you will be willing to buy it for
<br>
more money than I, and I can use that money to buy a house that better
<br>
suits my needs (perhaps a smaller one), and have some money left over
<br>
to do other things I like.  Property ends up in the hands of those who
<br>
can get the most use out of it, and the total amount of &quot;usefulness&quot;
<br>
in the world increases.
<br>
<p>Now if we create and enforce property rights in information (say,
<br>
the text of a book as the archetypal example), the same conditions
<br>
apply.  Those property rights enable me to take certain actions (like
<br>
selling the book, publicly performing it, selling derivative works,
<br>
etc.) that others cannot take (by law).  If others could make better
<br>
use of those rights (such as a publisher who might be able to sell
<br>
more because he has beter marketing), he will buy those rights from
<br>
me and make more money than I would, and I will spend that money on
<br>
things that increase my abilities (say, staying alive and writing
<br>
more books to sell).  The free market will indeed tend to produce
<br>
the optimal amount of _these property rights_.  But that begs the
<br>
question of whether we should have created and enforced these rights
<br>
in the first place.  Are these property rights the most valuable
<br>
thing about a book, or does a book itself enable more actions for
<br>
more people than does the property right?
<br>
<p>Let's make the other assumption; that it isn't possible to enforce
<br>
these exclusive rights.   Well, a book still enables actions that those
<br>
who don't have the book can't do: they can be entertained or informed
<br>
by reading it; they can inform and entertain others.  They can do the
<br>
things the book teaches them how to do, and it can inspire them to do
<br>
even more things.  In most cases when I want a book about something (or
<br>
to hear a tune, or to see a design for a machine, etc.), I'll download a
<br>
previously-written one that meets my needs; this increases my abilities,
<br>
and costs me and the &quot;seller&quot; next to nothing (download time, disk
<br>
space).  It does not affect the producer at all--he neither gains any
<br>
ability he didn't have before (as he would had I paid him), but nor does
<br>
he lose any.  Likewise, if I give the book (i.e., the information) to
<br>
someone else, I don't lose any abilities that I had before, and he
<br>
gains.  This world, then, optimizes the total amount of those things
<br>
about a book that are valuable independent of exclusive IP.  In our
<br>
excludable-IP world, the only people who would buy the book are those for
<br>
whom its value exceeds a certain threshhold, sufficient to pay the sellers
<br>
(who pay the producer).  In this latter world, _everyone_ who would
<br>
benefit (i.e., whose repertoire of available actions would increase) to
<br>
even the slightest degree would download the book, and producers and
<br>
sellers don't really factor in at all.
<br>
<p>So, in this latter world, what would get produced?  First, those novel 
<br>
works for which the value to a single consumer or group exceeds the
<br>
cost of production.  If I want a book about building houses with all
<br>
the latest information, I can find an expert and pay him to write it
<br>
(perhaps collecting investments from others who also want such a book).
<br>
This will probably be a minority case: only those books (or tunes, etc.)
<br>
whose novelty or timeliness is extremely valuable will get created.
<br>
News, fashion, &quot;hip&quot; music, etc. will still get produced.  What else will
<br>
be produced?  Works whose cost of production is tiny: especially
<br>
derivative works.  Maybe I can't afford to hire someone to write a whole
<br>
new book, but I _can_ afford some expert to look at the books available,
<br>
recommend one, or perhaps update it a bit, clarify some of it for me,
<br>
etc.  Without IP, anyone is free to do that.  The reputation of a good
<br>
updater/evaluator will be valuable: if I know that books from person X
<br>
are up to date and clear, I'll pay him a small premium for that; less
<br>
than the amount sufficient to finance production of new material, but more
<br>
than sufficient for him to search, edit, and update.  I'll even pay a
<br>
small amount for people who are just good at _finding_ good books.
<br>
<p>So, it appears to me that copyrights and patents encourage _novelty_,
<br>
i.e., they encourage the production of totally new information and
<br>
invention, at the expense of wide distribution of information and small
<br>
incremental changes and adaptations.  Whether or not that's a useful thing
<br>
to do is certainly arguable.  Do we really value &quot;inventiveness&quot; for
<br>
its own sake over &quot;craftsmanship&quot;, and over universal distribution?  If
<br>
we do, then perhaps IP is reasonable.  I'm not so sure.  I think
<br>
universal distribution is almost infinitely valuable, because it is
<br>
impossible to predict what access to information will enable or inspire.
<br>
And I don't think &quot;novelty&quot; and &quot;inventiveness&quot; are only valuable
<br>
when they are above the threshholds necessary for copyrights and
<br>
patents--and indeed I think it's impossible to rationally define
<br>
that threshhold, and encouraging only radical developments is
<br>
dangerous, when we could instead encourage gradual, incremental
<br>
development and universal access.  In the long run, I think that
<br>
would lead to even more creativity in the world as a whole, it would
<br>
just distribute the creativity over more minds.
