<em>&gt;From: Kai Becker &lt;<a href="mailto:kmb@kai-m-becker.de?Subject=Re:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;200112171943.LAA29110@well.com&gt;">kmb@kai-m-becker.de</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;My question: When Israel has such a high standard of living
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(GDP/person) and can afford[1] a large military service[2] with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modern high-tech weapons, why does it receive 6.43 times more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development aid per person than Egypt and 11.8 times more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan? What is paid from this money? Food? Houses?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Education? Weapons?
</em><br>
<p><p>Because the Israelis are our friends and allies.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Please don't get me wrong, I find it amazing what Israel has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieved since 1948 in terms of turning desert into acres. I just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find that development aid should be spend first, where people need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it most.
</em><br>
<p>You may spend your money wherever you like, we will do the same.
<br>
<p>We are not the international welfare society.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;.... much to the astonishment of most of the worlds population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm afraid to say.
</em><br>
<p><p>So in other words most of the worlds population is completely
<br>
clueless as to what we are about.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But Samantha and I didn't write about the reaction on the terror
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attacks, but about the unconditional support for only one side
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Israel), while  mostly ignoring the rest.
</em><br>
<p><p>And continue to ignore the facts.
<br>
<p>The Palestinians are not the U.S.'s friends. During the Gulf war
<br>
they supported Saddam, they danced in the streets on 9/11.
<br>
<p>A year and a half or so ago Yassir (the terrorist) Arafat walked
<br>
out of a negotiation where almost everything he said he wanted was
<br>
on the table. Yet he got up, walked out, and started the intifada
<br>
again.
<br>
<p>Bottom line, either he can't stop terrorist acts against Israel, or
<br>
he won't, in either case there is no reason for the Israelis to say
<br>
boo to him till his actions are equal to his empty words.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;A crime can not be justified by another. This is a simple rule of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modern law. Otherwise we would have many bad examples in history
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to justify almost everything.
</em><br>
<p><p>We haven't committed any crime. We have responded to an act of war
<br>
in kind.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;What I was trying to explain was that there is already a war-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation in the middle east for years now, which Mr. Jones
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apparently didn't know. I don't think that the US government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't know that. I must therefore assume, that the actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ignored it. Pres. Bush even tried to step outside the discussion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until he found out that the others won't let him escape.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure if you are referring to the Israel/Palestinian thing
<br>
again here or not. If so I've already answered it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I apologize. I have overstressed my rethoric... So, you are right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the money spend to bomb the rest of Afghanistan into pieces,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scatter thousands of refugees across the land to find a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt;villain is only twice the GDP of this land or 26 times the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development aid it received in 2000. (you might detect a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irony here...)
</em><br>
<p><p>What I detect is a pile of incorrect facts.
<br>
<p>The attack on Afghanistan was to wipe out the terrorist training
<br>
camps and the members of Al-Quaeda and their Taliban supporters
<br>
after they murdered thousands of american civilians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Don't you think that a small part of this money spent in 1995/96
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have been sufficient to guide this country towards stability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and democracy? Do you understand my point now?
</em><br>
<p>To the Taliban? Hell no.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Afghanistan has large resources of natural gas, coal and copper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The license for the planned gas pipeline alone would bring over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;$150Mio per year. Establish an economics where the afghan people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can exploit these resources and really earn that money (instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Exxon or Shell). This would eliminate the wish to produce opium.
</em><br>
<p>So one minute you're saying we interfere to much, then the next
<br>
you're telling us how we should be interfering...
<br>
<p>Sheesh.
