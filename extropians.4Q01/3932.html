<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DAVIS, Calif., Dec. 5 (AScribe Newswire) -- Over the years, scientists
<br>
have theorized that longer life spans among some animal species, including
<br>
humans, might be attributed to the size of their brains, protective body
<br>
features or even a superior ability to flee from predators.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, two University of California, Davis researchers propose that,
<br>
among
<br>
humans and other social species, a long life span is a desirable trait that
<br>
has
<br>
developed through the evolutionary process. In fact, their model of longevity
<br>
suggests that long life spans among social species offer benefits conducive to
<br>
even longer life spans in successive generations. Extension of the life span
<br>
is
<br>
a &quot;self-reinforcing&quot; process, they propose.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This entirely reframes the way we consider the future of human life
<br>
expectancy,&quot; says James Carey, a UC Davis authority on biology and the
<br>
demography of aging and life span. &quot;This model of longevity extension in
<br>
humans, combined with evidence that human life span is not fixed but is
<br>
continuing to increase in developed countries, suggests that there is every
<br>
reason to believe that human life span will continue to increase in the
<br>
foreseeable future.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carey is a senior scholar at the Center for the Economics and
<br>
Demography
<br>
of Aging at UC Berkeley and one of four panelists who debated the future of
<br>
human life span during the recent meeting of the International Union for the
<br>
Scientific Study of Population. He and Debra Judge, a UC Davis research
<br>
ecologist, published a paper titled &quot;Life Span Extension in Humans Is
<br>
Self-Reinforcing: A General Theory of Longevity&quot; in a recent issue of the
<br>
scientific journal &quot;Population and Development Review.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long life spans, they point out, offer numerous advantages to humans
<br>
and
<br>
other animals that live in social communities rather than individually. Small
<br>
increases in longevity can be amplified in successive generations, leading to
<br>
even greater longevity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a longer life allows more opportunity for humans and other
<br>
species over time to develop the biological mechanisms that at older ages will
<br>
maintain health and repair physical flaws. Increased longevity also makes it
<br>
possible for older individuals to nurture and pass on resources to the younger
<br>
generation. And, as the life span lengthens and experience increases
<br>
efficiency, the products of the labor of the community can be reinvested among
<br>
several generations, allowing individuals to specialize in their areas of
<br>
strength, fostering innovations that, in turn, promote longer life.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when the life span is extended, the number of offspring usually
<br>
decreases, allowing parents to invest more resources for a longer period in
<br>
children who are therefore more likely to survive, the researchers point out.
<br>
This decreases the physical drain on the parents, resulting in adults and
<br>
children that are healthier and longer lived.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, long life breeds long life.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This model of longevity suggests that continuing developments in
<br>
science and technology, such as organ cloning, transplantation of organs from
<br>
other animals and molecular medicine, will further equip humans to gain more
<br>
control over their environment, health and overall quality of life,&quot; says
<br>
Carey. &quot;People increasingly will be able to make choices that will lead to
<br>
longer lives for themselves and their children.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This research project was funded by the National Institute on Aging.
