<p>Heh heh heh. Guns don't kill, but our lobbyists damn sure do!!!
<br>
I ought to join up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is it then that most groups who espouse an anti-coporate agenda are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also opposed to the NRA? It is important to understand this sort of
</em><br>
<p>Two reasons.
<br>
<p>1. Ideological lock-in; i.e. an irrational linking of memes. A person
<br>
believes that racism or sexism is wrong for example. They look around
<br>
to see who else feels the same way, and sees our old buddies the
<br>
lefties. Uncritically buys the leftie package deal, which includes gun
<br>
control though there isn't anything about it inherently pro- or
<br>
anti-bigotry.
<br>
<p>2. The apart from the odd contradictory ideology of anarcho-socialism,
<br>
modern leftists are generally statists. They think that their best
<br>
shot at utopia is imposing their ideas on others using the machinery
<br>
of state.  Since an armed populace is the final safeguard against a
<br>
state that oversteps its bounds, they are doing their best to get rid
<br>
of that inconvenience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The NRA is effective because it has &quot;God&quot; on its side politically: The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Constitution says the NRA is right, in terms that are easy to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for most people. The term &quot;The right of the people to keep and bear arms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shall not be infringed&quot; is extremely easy for the average dope to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehend. They don't need a lawyer or law maker or judge to tell them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what that means. There isn't more than two two syllable words in there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and no terms that are not ordinary speech.
</em><br>
<p>I like how the lefties distort it to say &quot;it applies to muskets, not
<br>
these newfangled big scary ASSAULT WEAPONS&quot;. I wonder if they are the
<br>
same ones who feel freedom of the press applies to hand-cranked
<br>
printing presses and not to photocopy machines, laser printers, and
<br>
CD-RW burners.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For extropy, I think the best thing we can do on the political front is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find similar language and grab onto it. Claim it as our own, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only we can truly defend the people's interests in it, etc. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishes our cause as having a tradition worth defending, one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every person has an interest in.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there is enough modernism left, despite of generations of
<br>
erosion by the leftilists, that maybe simply &quot;Nevermind the bullshit,
<br>
let's seek progress&quot; will resonate with the public.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that this is inevitable. Politics doesn't work at all well on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;I am an army of one&quot; philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree. Unless you are preternaturally charismatic, any plan for
<br>
changing the world you come up with has to scale. By that I mean: the
<br>
entry costs must be low, each input of effort has to leverage a
<br>
measurable difference, and it must not need any central
<br>
hierarchy. Those are the ingredients to the memes that take on a life
<br>
of their own and spread virally.
<br>

<br>
