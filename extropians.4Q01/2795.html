<em>&gt; It's not an embryo? If this strange opinion gets accepted, it might imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a being grown from such an `organism' is not a human. But surely the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law is not such an ass.
</em><br>
<p>Actually it has more to do with medicine than the law.
<br>
See:
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_fetu.htm">http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_fetu.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Until it implants its a blastocyst.  It doesn't become an embryo
<br>
until it becomes a parasite on the woman carrying it.
<br>
<p>Its probably even questionable whether it can even be considered
<br>
a blastocyst since those result from normal fertilization while
<br>
clones use nuclear transfer.
<br>
<p>The problem with laws is that if you don't write them anticipating
<br>
technological change, it can rapidly get away from you.  I posted
<br>
the pointers to the U.S. laws a few months ago -- as I recall they
<br>
were written more recently (and more restrictively) than the British
<br>
Law(s) that the court ruled on.
<br>
<p>Does anyone know whether one could be prosecuted for having the
<br>
procedures done in international waters?
<br>
<p>Of course its going to get very interesting if it turns out that
<br>
any relatively &quot;close&quot; egg will do.  That means you will be able
<br>
to use chimpanzee eggs and avoid one of the more expensive
<br>
and risky parts of the process (hormone treatments for egg
<br>
maturation and surgery to harvest them).  If the development
<br>
of artificial wombs proceeds then we can eliminate the
<br>
requirement for a female host as well.
<br>
<p>Its going to get interesting out there.  Rock N Roll.
<br>
