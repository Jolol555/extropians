<p><em>&gt;As I mentioned in this or another posts you would convert the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cars and trucks (at least) to electric, fuel-cells and so on. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We already pretty well know how to do this now.  We just need a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bit of incentive.  Getting out of dependence on Arab oil about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now might be incentive enough.  The nuclear plants generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electrical power.
</em><br>
<p>Incentive for whom?  If I pay $10,000 more to drive a 2-seater
<br>
fiberglass shell containing hundreds of pounds of lead and acid
<br>
which doesn't even have the range for my routine day-trips
<br>
without recharging, the benefits of reducing dependence go to
<br>
the entire world. I'd be nuts to buy one, and so would anybody else, and
<br>
that's why only a few hundred of those electric cars got sold.
<br>
Likewise nuke plants haven't been profitable for their builders.
<br>
There are great reasons to use gas/oil - they're cheap, portable, 
<br>
have excellent infrastructures, and are well-tested.  At current
<br>
prices, current use is pretty rational.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the market was so efficient there would be no need for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;screwing around with these taxes.
</em><br>
<p>The market is efficient, but it doesn't necessarily capture all
<br>
costs correctly.  If our oil money goes to fund fundamentalist
<br>
Islamic proselytizing (which it does) which generates committed
<br>
well-educated suicidal terrorists, that's a major cost of oil/
<br>
gas which isn't showing up at the pump/gas meter.  Somehow  
<br>
you've got to get that externality into the prices or we will
<br>
bad decisions because we're getting bad information (inaccurately
<br>
low prices).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would also point out that you aren't going to reach a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropian dreams without much more economical, clean, available
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and sustainable power than you have today.  
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  AI, IA, immortality, better access to information,
<br>
more open societies -  none of these require any more energy 
<br>
than we've got today. Space exploration, yes, but that's about 
<br>
it, and what we need to replace oil and gas won't help much
<br>
with the propulsion issues that limit us in space.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;There are more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficient incentives without slapping huge tariffs on.
</em><br>
<p>I will confidently say my Malibu is superior even to the decade-off
<br>
concept cars.  I've yet to see any alternative fuel 
<br>
vehicle I would even briefly consider trading in my car for.
<br>
My gas range and heater are far cheaper and more convenient
<br>
than electric alternatives.  And I certainly don't want to
<br>
fly in a battery-powered plane!
