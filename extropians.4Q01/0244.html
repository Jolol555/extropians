<em>&gt; YET ANOTHER forwarded message with no commentary.
</em><br>
<p>Hal, you seem able to think for yourself, so why do you need my commentary?
<br>
<p>I actually don't want to go too far to defend Sobran, but let me respond to
<br>
some of your points.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Or is he saying: &quot;Just as we hoped. Bush is following the script we
</em><br>
wrote.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Of course we knew the Americans would take the bait! That was our whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; design! Soon there will be open war between the infidels and Islam&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The enemy has done the unexpected. Our own government has done only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; expected. There is no doubt who is winning, or who holds the upper hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my opinion this is baloney.  What the U.S. government has done has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been completely unexpected.  I'll bet not one person in 100 would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicted on September 12 that there would have been NO U.S. military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reprisals three weeks later.
</em><br>
<p>I think that's just the lag to build up forces and plan the attack.  Recall,
<br>
the Persian Gulf War took a huge buildup.
<br>
<p>Also, some news agencies are already reporting Army Special Forces
<br>
operations in Afghanistan...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; His whole point was to turn this into a war between Islam and the West.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has been his stated goal over many years, described in interviews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and articles.  He wants to provoke an over-reaction by the West which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will awaken the Islamic world and unite them in violent opposition to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western culture and governments.
</em><br>
<p>It's too early to tell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead the U.S. has gone to enormous pains to distinguish between Islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the terrorists.  Every day, the President or his spokesman say good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things about Islam and praise the Islamic states which are allying with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  Many of those nations are just as afraid of terrorism as we are.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, that is going on.  We shall see how far that goes, especially if
<br>
Afghani civilians start to die in big numbers.  It might play one way or
<br>
another.  (In the Persian Gulf War and after, while there were protests and
<br>
the like against Iraqi civilians deaths, this did not immediately collapse
<br>
the Coalition.  Later, the Coalition did collapse, but it might be argued
<br>
that such alliances are pragmatic and short lived anyhow.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who would have thought three weeks ago that Pakistan of all countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be one of our most important alliance partners in this effort?
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Pakistan has been a formal US ally since 1954.  During the Soviet
<br>
occupation of Afghanistan, Pakistan acted as America's proxy in the region,
<br>
channeling US aid to the &quot;freedom fighters.&quot;  It's only after Pakistan
<br>
detonated nukes that this relationship started to cool, but it never went
<br>
totally cold.
<br>
<p>Add to this, Pakistan probably has the most information on and connections
<br>
with the Teleban -- helping to put them in power -- of any government and is
<br>
right on their border.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I doubt very much that bin Laden planned for that!
</em><br>
<p>I think you're reading to much into Sobran.  I don't think bin Laden has
<br>
every detail of World History worked out from the WTC attack until the year
<br>
2100.  I don't think Sobran believes that either, especially given his
<br>
remark that &quot;[o]f course the enemy doesn't know how events will play out
<br>
either, but it is too reckless to care. It represents the nemesis of the
<br>
modern state, too weak to conquer but satisfied with the stupendous
<br>
disruption it can achieve.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even the Sudan has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made encouraging noises, and Iran is supporting the Northern Alliance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the Taliban.
</em><br>
<p>BUT Iran has always supported the Northern Alliance.  This is not a coup for
<br>
the US or against bin Laden.  The Taleban are Sunni.  Iran is ruled by the
<br>
rival Shiite sect.  Add to this that Iran is suffering from a huge influx of
<br>
refugees from the Teleban.  So, economics enters into the picture as well as
<br>
religion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The U.S. has been very successful in exposing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; division within the Islamic world between the violent extremists like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bin Laden and the far more numerous moderates who see him as a threat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a direct and intentional counter to bin Laden's strategic plan.
</em><br>
<p>I think the problem is not this at all.  The Islamic world has basically
<br>
always been divided.  The unity is has had has usually been against external
<br>
threats.  Even ideals like Pan-Arabism make for diviseness, since it sets
<br>
the stage for conflict.  After all, who would rule a pan-Arab or pan-Muslim
<br>
nation?
<br>
<p>The more important point in Sobran's piece was the potential impact outside
<br>
of the Islamic world in the long run.  That is, now the world knows, despite
<br>
the US's ability to turn cities into rubble, it can't really defend its own
<br>
cities.  (This is a lesson I wish the world remained ignorant of.  I.e., I'm
<br>
not happy it came about.  I'd rather be wrong and for Sobran to be wrong
<br>
about this point, especially since I am an American.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
