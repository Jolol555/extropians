<p>By the quantum entanglement we were talking about, of course.  I'd also

like to note (since that section was cut out) that I was using

communication with the past to *disprove* quantum entanglement.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;These ideas about communicating with the past via exceeding light speed
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid I have to admit I don't watch star trek.  I believe I first 
<br>
heard about this in &quot;Six Easy Pieces&quot; or some other Feynman.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There is an absolute frame of reference in at least one dimension. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example, we all know the Big Bang occured at some point in the past.
</em><br>
<p>This does not prove an absolute frame of reference!  It shows that people 
<br>
agree on the direction of Big
<br>
Bang, not how long ago it occurred.  With any other event, the time that 
<br>
has passed is relative to the observer's velocity.  Thus, time is *not* an 
<br>
absolute reference frame.  I believe that the magnitude of the space/time 
<br>
vector of an event relative to the Big Bang is constant across all 
<br>
viewpoints, but that simply shows that time can't exist as an absolute 
<br>
reference frame by itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Temporally speaking, therefore, we can all deal relativistically with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each other in reference to the Big Bang event, so in the dimension of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time, there IS an absolute frame of reference. This is essentially what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occurs when we are x many light years from each other. We may experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more time than others due to our relative veolcities (even then, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate of temporal passage occurs in reference to actual zero velocity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is an interesting question to ask: Just what frame of reference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;results in the fastest possible passage of time? Is this determined by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the velocities of the majority of the matter in your local region, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;galactic arm, or your galaxy? If all matter in the universe is screaming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away from all other matter, which one has the frame of reference with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the fastest possible passage of time?)
</em><br>
<p>To demonstrate that events that are simultaneous from one view point are 
<br>
not necessarily simultaneous from another, lets use a classic thought 
<br>
experiment.  Suppose two guys are sitting at opposite ends of train car, 
<br>
and that there is a light bulb midway between them.  The light bulb emits 
<br>
two photons at the same time/place.  Lets say the train is 60m long.  This 
<br>
means that the light takes 100nS to cross the distance to both people.  The 
<br>
person(A) at one end can see the effect of the light on the other person(B) 
<br>
after a photon from B travels to A, taking another 200nS after he first saw 
<br>
the original light, which is perfectly consist ant with A's knowledge of 
<br>
physics.
<br>
<p>Now lets say that, unknown to A and B, we see the car that they are 
<br>
travelling on is actually speeding along at .5 c in B's direction.  This 
<br>
means that the length of the car is reduced by a factor of 1.155 to 
<br>
51.95m  The light now takes 173.1ns to reach B, while only taking 57.7ns to 
<br>
reach A, meaning the light reaches B 115.4ns after it reaches A.  From 
<br>
there it takes the light 115.4 ns for A to see the light reach B, making 
<br>
the total delay from A's receiving the photon to B's seeing a photon hit B 
<br>
230.8 ns.  However, due to time dilation, A's perception of time has slowed 
<br>
down by a factor of 1.155.  That means that 200ns of A's subjective time 
<br>
have passed between A seeing the photon, and A seeing the effects of B's 
<br>
photon, all of which seems perfectly consistent with A's knowledge of physics.
<br>
<p>Since we don't know whether our reference frame or A's reference frame is 
<br>
the One True Reference Frame, and since we strongly begin to suspect that 
<br>
such a thing doesn't exist, we can't tell whether the light reached A and B 
<br>
simultaneously, or whether 115.4 nano seconds passed.  Thus, whether events 
<br>
are simultaneous depends on the observer's frame of reference.
