This war is not about terror, it's about Islam
<br>
By David Selbourne
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.co.uk/dt?ac=000659276559150&rtmo=pUNhplle&atmo">http://www.dailytelegraph.co.uk/dt?ac=000659276559150&rtmo=pUNhplle&atmo</a>
<br>
=pUNhplle&amp;pg=/01/10/7/do01.html
<br>
<p><p>THE war of the hour, we are told, is against &quot;global terrorism&quot;. So
<br>
declared President Bush in his speech to Congress on September 20 and
<br>
Tony Blair in his oration to his Party Conference last week. It is
<br>
nothing of the sort.
<br>
<p>The Soviet Union was once the evil empire challenging the West. Now it
<br>
is the resurgence, or insurgency, of Islam that looms over the
<br>
non-Islamic world. The momentum of the Islamic revival has been
<br>
gathering pace at least since the 1950s. Yet the West's justified fear
<br>
of this resurgence and a desire to avoid offence to the Islamic faith
<br>
have had our leaders treading on eggshells over the events of September
<br>
11. 
<br>
<p>The hostile engagement between Islam and the West has not been in doubt
<br>
for years. Thus, when Baroness Thatcher reminds us that it was Muslims
<br>
who brought down the World Trade Centre, and Muslim spokesmen express
<br>
their outrage that anyone should relate the act to Muslims, it is hard
<br>
to know whether to laugh or weep. 
<br>
<p>Our very declaration of war - against the &quot;global terror&quot; - is itself
<br>
bogus. There is no war to declare. There has been a war on for decades.
<br>
It has included savage hostilities among Muslims (as within Algeria,
<br>
Lebanon, Iraq, and so on) but, more pertinently for us, between
<br>
Islamists and the West. Russia and China have been caught up in it too. 
<br>
<p>When President Bush announced his National Missile Defence Programme,
<br>
citing the risk of attack from &quot;rogue states&quot;, it was not North Korea he
<br>
had in mind but those Islamic countries with nuclear, chemical and
<br>
biological weapons already acquired, or being acquired. Moreover, of the
<br>
seven nations on the State Departments list of terrorist nations, five
<br>
are Islamic.
<br>
<p>With New York skyscrapers turned to rubble and thousands dead, there
<br>
have been few boundaries, whether of territory or moral principle, of
<br>
method of combat or falsification of word, that have not been
<br>
transgressed on this battlefield. Yet taboo, a false tact and short-term
<br>
memory loss serve between them to cloud our knowledge of what is afoot.
<br>
US and British bombers patrol Iraqi airspace, Israeli forces carry out
<br>
assaults in Gaza and the West Bank, and President Clinton launched
<br>
missile attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan without the declaration of war.
<br>
There has been no need.
<br>
<p>There have been many other wars since 1945 that have nothing to do with
<br>
Islam. But from the 1950s, and especially once the fall of Communism in
<br>
1989-1991 had freed the Muslim states of the Soviet bloc from their
<br>
straitjackets, Islam has taken the lead in anti-Western activity
<br>
politically, religiously and militarily. It has brandished guns in one
<br>
hand and sacred texts in another, demonising America, Zionism and
<br>
Christianity. But from an explicable desire not to include in our
<br>
objections &quot;the good Muslim&quot; - of whom there are millions - we avoid
<br>
saying what we know and fear.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, there are few areas in the world, from the Caucasus to
<br>
Kashmir, from the Moluccas to Manhattan, from Tunisia to Tanzania, that
<br>
have not suffered from the Islamic convulsion. In previous upsurges
<br>
Islam gained an empire from the Indus to the Pyrenees. It created the
<br>
aesthetic glories and sufferings of Islamic Spain, and brought the Turks
<br>
and their Ottoman Empire to the gates of Vienna.
<br>
<p>Black-masked, flag-burning Islamist militants are hard to connect with
<br>
their predecessors who created the Alhambra in Granada or Seville's
<br>
Alcazar, and with the great Islamic philosophers of the Middle Ages, the
<br>
friends and intellectual peers of Christian and Jewish sages of those
<br>
times. The &quot;good Muslim&quot; may take his moral distance from hijackings,
<br>
inter-Muslim brutalities, the blowing-up of embassies, book-burning and
<br>
so on. But the fount of Islamic energy, of its destructiveness and high
<br>
aspiration, are the same as they have always been: the desire to protect
<br>
the purity of the Islamic faith and to vindicate its claim to be the
<br>
final revealed religion on earth.
<br>
<p>Islamophobia has exacted a brutal toll in reprisal for Islamic violence.
<br>
This includes the shooting down by the US of an Iranian airliner in July
<br>
1998, the assassinations carried out by the Israelis, the savaging of
<br>
Muslim Chechnya by the Russians, the hangings of Islamists in Xinjiang
<br>
by the Chinese - still continuing - the coalition turkey-shoot of the
<br>
Iraqi army after its retreat from Kuwait and the near-genocide of
<br>
Muslims in Bosnia.
<br>
<p>But then this is war, undeclared as may be. It has already taken a
<br>
bewildering variety of forms and struck in many places. In 1972, Israeli
<br>
athletes were murdered by Islamist militants at the Munich Olympics. The
<br>
attempt on the Pope's life was made by a Turk whose controllers remain
<br>
unknown. A Libyan plot brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland in
<br>
December 1988. In February 1989, the Iranian fatwah against Salman
<br>
Rushdie was pronounced by Khomeini. In Sudan, Muslim sharia law was
<br>
introduced by the Islamist government in 1991 and civil war has raged
<br>
between Muslim north and Christian south ever since.
<br>
<p>The upheavals provoked by the resurgence have taken millions of lives.
<br>
The Sudanese civil war and famine have led to some two million deaths.
<br>
The Biafran civil war in 1967 in Nigeria between the dominant Muslim
<br>
majority and Christian Ibo immigrants killed some one million people.
<br>
Even the largely unheard-of 1991 Tajikistan civil war, provoked by
<br>
Islamist secessionists, caused tens of thousands of dead. 
<br>
<p>In addition to the corpses in this war have been refugees, migrants, and
<br>
asylum seekers. Millions have fled the Islamic world; some
<br>
three-quarters of the world's migrants in the last decade are said to
<br>
have been Muslims. They have been variously escaping sharia law,
<br>
inter-Muslim conflict, economic chaos, Muslim-Christian violence and,
<br>
not least, anti-Muslim aggression. Escapees, victims, scapegoats,
<br>
malefactors and &quot;sleepers&quot; awaiting their moment, they signify that an
<br>
aroused and angered Islam is on the move.
<br>
<p>For politicians simply to call all this &quot;terror&quot;, and to promise to
<br>
extirpate it with precision strikes and the denial of funds is a folly.
<br>
As the equivocations of Saudi Arabia and a nuclear-armed Pakistan
<br>
reveal, the Islamic nations know that it is the resurgence of Islam not
<br>
&quot;terrorism&quot; which has prompted the West's call to action. These nations
<br>
cannot afford to support this call wholeheartedly, no more than can any
<br>
&quot;good Muslim&quot; spokesman in Britain, whatever Baroness Thatcher may
<br>
expect of them. 
<br>
<p>In every war, the first casualty is said to be truth. In this one, our
<br>
politicians have not even begun to admit to us what it is really about.
