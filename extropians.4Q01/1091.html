<em>&gt;Randy Smith wrote in response to Miriam:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And you wouldn't even own a house if someone hadn't sold you one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So therefore I may sleep in your house whenever I please--free of charge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;### I have some misgivings about getting involved in the discussion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Randy started but, whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, boy. More insults!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Here it goes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As an immigrant I represent a clear gain for the American society. I came
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with excellent education (worth about 300 000$, counting the investment in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my childhood, grade school, high school, medical school, postgraduate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;education, entirely paid by the taxpayers in Poland and Germany), good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;health, decent work ethic. By competing with local physicians, I and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IMG's (International Medical Graduates) contributed to the reduction in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;healthcare cost growth rate that occurred in the last few years, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maintaining a consistent standard of quality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I do pay to sleep in my house. I own it. I am a taxpayer (even though I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not allowed to vote - this is taxation without representation), and my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;money
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goes toward the Social Security and welfare benefits of persons who do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessarily contribute to the American society but had the priviledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being born here. By the way, do you expect to receive such assistance or or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are you receiving it? If yes, some of it is my money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The question of regulating immigration can best be solved to the benefit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the American nation by an impartial economic analysis aiming to optimize 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gains and reduce the losses due to immigration, both of which can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measured. Cheap xenophobia will harm you. It will reduce your retirement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;income.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rafal Smigrodzki, MD-PhD
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;************************
<br>
<p><p>I have stated many, many times, that I think that ANYONE and EVERYONE with a 
<br>
legitimate MD shoukd be able to come here to the USA. In fact, I have 
<br>
suggested PAYING them large sums of money to come here. I have suggested 
<br>
building medical schools in 3rd worlds so we can get MORE M.D.s here. The 
<br>
same thing goes for PhD's or even for *legitimate* students who want to 
<br>
study for a PhD here, and already have a *good* degree.
<br>
<p>You are wrong about immigrants in general being a plus for America, or for 
<br>
me. You are not the general case. Not only are there many studies showing 
<br>
just that, but common *emotionally detached* sense will tell you the same 
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p>But I see I cannot discuss this with you rationally because you cannot 
<br>
separate the issue from yuor emotions.
