</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be interested to read about this 'proven fact' - do you have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference? Presumably your 'proven fact' only applies specifically to US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society where it is legal to own a handgun (unlike the UK, where it is not -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any more).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it should apply, since violent crime in the UK is higher than
<br>
the US. The only crime category where the UK is lower is murder, and the
<br>
UKs rate there is rising, while the US rate is falling as more and more
<br>
citizens carry concealed weapons here, and fewer carry there.
<br>
<p>Dr. John Lott's seminal work: &quot;More Guns, Less Crime&quot; details the 1% to
<br>
2% phenomenon, which has been verified by independent experts.
<br>
<p>Anti-gunners will typically only compare gun deaths in the UK vs. the
<br>
US, and they will typically add in US suicides as well. The proper
<br>
comparison is ALL violent crime deaths, as well as all violent crime,
<br>
since Brits prefer the use of knives and bats as deadly weapons, while
<br>
guns are preferred here.
<br>
<p>However, this does not count other violent crimes like assault, rape,
<br>
mugging, etc... and the unadjusted raw data that the media reports has
<br>
eliminated all reference to the ethnic and racial origins of the
<br>
perpetrators and the victims. When you equalize for the fact that the US
<br>
is nearly 40% populated by minorities, while Britain is barely 12% (and
<br>
that most crime is caused by minorities), the US figures come out
<br>
significantly better than the UK.
<br>
<p>Although another big problem with British violent crime numbers is how
<br>
they are reported. If a person kills three people in one night, the
<br>
British government counts that as one crime, while the US counts it as
<br>
three. Because of this, British crime data is seriously flawed with
<br>
respect to the counting methodology used by much of the rest of the
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the British homicide rates were much lower BEFORE it
<br>
instituted gun controls. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not an expert on the gun control debate; but I do know enough to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there are far too many people on either side making dramatic claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about what has been 'proven'; often without much factual evidence. I suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we should stick to hard evidence and reference this discussion, or it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will degenerate into meaningless political posturing.
</em><br>
<p>If you doubt my references, or my word, you can do a little research
<br>
yourself to verify this, using the same statistical techniques. I've
<br>
looked at crime data published by the FBI, and formerly by the UK
<br>
(although the UK government no longer releases this raw data, because it
<br>
keeps proving the point of the pro-gun movement).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, the 'innocent until proven guilty' standard cannot apply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals immigrating. Those wishing to travel to our open society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from societies with much lower standards of trust must be held up to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; higher standard of behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pretty shocking stuff. You're advocating an 'open society'; but one which at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same time, routinely practices discrimination on the basis of country of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; birth and where all are not equal under the eyes of the law. I believe this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undermines virtually all the principles on which the United States was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; founded. You're saying that - after gaining permission to reside in the US -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some citizens are more equal than others; and more shocking than that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some citizens should not be deemed innocent of crimes until proven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guilty.
</em><br>
<p>What I am saying is that there needs to be a filtration system put in
<br>
place between high trust and low trust societies. Failing to do so will
<br>
only result, as we have seen, in a social equivalent of the old 'bad
<br>
money pushes out good money' phenomenon. Allowing unrestricted access to
<br>
individuals from low trust societies only results in your high trust
<br>
society becoming diluted into a low trust society, at a rate relative to
<br>
the rate of immigration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am new to the extropian list, but judging from some of the themes explored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the other threads, I believe that this would be a position that would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profoundly and totally rejected by most transhumanists.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, there is a significant discussion going on about protecting
<br>
open and free high trust societies from the corrosive influence of low
<br>
trust societies, as well as formulating institutions which would help to
<br>
change low trust societies into high trust ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because, as we have seen, the worst such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; societies do not generally cooperate with our immigration authorities in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; determining who is trustworthy or not (especially in the case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals who are members of state sponsored terrorist groups).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your argument has moved on. Previously you argued that individuals violated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their immigration status; now you're suggesting that this deception of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; INS is aided and abetted by foreign states. What evidence do you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support this assertion?
</em><br>
<p>We know that al Qaeda was based in the Sudan with the support of the
<br>
Sudanese government, and from there, they recruited and sent terrorists
<br>
to the US to bomb the WTC in 1993. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
<br>
You apparently have a very poor memory when it comes to terrorism.
<br>
Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad would not exist without the tacit support of
<br>
the Syrian and Iranian governments, and their headquarters are in
<br>
Damascus, openly and publicly.
<br>
<p>Al Qaeda itself was the security arm of the Taliban government. What
<br>
rock have you been hiding under? Al Qaeda has, we now know, recieved
<br>
financial and material support from members of the Saudi Royal Family,
<br>
the government of Somalia, the government of Iraq.
