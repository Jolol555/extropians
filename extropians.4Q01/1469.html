<p>I assume this system would be of great interest to any government that 
<br>
wants to keep tabs on its subjects.
<br>
<p>If the intent is to keep track of everything, for possible future evidence, 
<br>
like the British seem to want to do with electronic communications, the 
<br>
requirements quickly become immense. Tracking a few cars via onboard 
<br>
transponders, once the infrastructure is in place, would be fairly simple. 
<br>
The trouble with this being used to investigate criminal acts is that the 
<br>
bad guys are going to fox the system - it's not hard to conceive of a black 
<br>
market in &quot;clean&quot; transponders.
<br>
<p>License plate recognition has been used in a few areas - I think Southern 
<br>
California played with it, and New Jersey (?) was sending out mailings to 
<br>
random people caught on film as a way of doing rush hour drive 
<br>
studies.  And then, there's Lo-Jack, which has caught a fair number of car 
<br>
thieves.
<br>
<p>Again, the system only works for law-abiding types, and stupid crooks. 
<br>
Anyone planning something serious, like 9-11, will take this into account, 
<br>
and will not be nailed by tracking devices.
