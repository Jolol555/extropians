<p>There is Iran and there is Iran. Would you be scared of conservative
<br>
priests wielding nanotech or the relatively liberal government (which is
<br>
often opposed to them) wielding nanotech? (Of course, my answer is that
<br>
both are scary, I want to see *people* wield nanotech, not unaccountable
<br>
governments - and that includes the Swedish and US ones too). There is
<br>
the common US assumption that Iran is composed of Quran-thumping
<br>
Khomeini clones, but the reality is far more complex. 
<br>
<p>My favorite is the ban on satelite dishes (something that was actually
<br>
proposed 2 years earlier in Sweden!) - you can get serious punishment
<br>
for having one of those. But the government has ruled that to report
<br>
such a crime to the police, you have to pay a very expensive stamp duty.
<br>
So nobody reports it. Just one example of how the struggle between
<br>
liberalisation and conservatism is waged in Iran.
<br>
<p>A world full of nanotech is of course a dangerous place, but so is any
<br>
world full of any tech. The issue is whether the danger is so large as
<br>
to render having nanotech less beneficial on average than not having it.
<br>
I think the answer is a clear yes to nano: it is so useful that it is
<br>
worth the risks, and I think we can handle them. Having a diverse group
<br>
of institutions researching it openly is far better than secret
<br>
manhattan projects when it comes to accountability and safety.
