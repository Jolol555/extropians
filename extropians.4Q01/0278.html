<em>&gt; I did some research on this a couple weeks ago with the help of some others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to check my conclusions, and the conclusion is the M95 gas mask is pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much the best general gas mask. It is a modern ergonomic design with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent filter that can take care of just about anything including stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like chlorine, ammonia, and smallpox. This place used to have it advertised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for under $200, but now it looks like they upped their price:

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.botachtactical.com/gasmasks1.html">http://www.botachtactical.com/gasmasks1.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>NOTE: Smallpox is an amazingly HUGE virus. Do not expect other viral
<br>
attacks (anthrax, hanta, etc) to be stopped by this filter, though it
<br>
should be able to deal with bacterial attacks like botulin, bubonic,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>While anthrax can be treated with a vaccine (as can smallpox, of
<br>
course), hanta has no vaccine at this point, so far as I know. Anybody
<br>
know different?
<br>
<p>Hanta can be spread by the spraying of dried dust of the excrement of
<br>
infected rodents. Don't know if you must ingest the dust itself.
<br>
<p>Furthermore: having a gas mask does not protect you against all chemical
<br>
attacks. Many, including nerve agents, penetrate through the skin. There
<br>
are antidotes available for many nerve agents, that typically are
<br>
composed of two injections: a highly toxic anti-toxin, and the
<br>
anti-toxin's counter agent (if you took the anti-toxin when you were not
<br>
under attack, you  would poison yourself without the counteragent).
<br>
<p>Some chemical attacks will include multiple weapons, meant to get you to
<br>
remove some part of your protective gear (itching and blistering agents
<br>
do this) so as to expose yourself more to other toxins like nerve
<br>
agents.
<br>
<p>Finally: gas masks are uncomfortable. TOO BAD. Take it off and expect to
<br>
die. With NBC gear on, you do learn a great amount of patience with the
<br>
sweating, itches, scratches, heat and humidity, tightness, etc. If you
<br>
are a fidgety person, practice by putting on all your gear and then
<br>
doing your yoga meditations for a good couple hours. If anything can
<br>
help you attain trance-like states, it is learning to ignore the
<br>
discomfort of NBC gear for extended periods.
<br>
<p>ALSO: don't just get a gasmask. There are inexpensive sensors you can
<br>
buy that detect the presence of various toxic agents. Not only are they
<br>
important for telling you when to put your gear on, but also telling you
<br>
when it is safe to take it off.
