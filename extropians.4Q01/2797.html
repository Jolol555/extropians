<p>
I live in Santa Barbara, a coastal community where we often have foggy
<br>
nights.  Friday night was clear and Saturday started that way, but when I
<br>
went out at 11 the sky was overcast and it got worse as the night went on.
<br>
The predicted peak here was at 2 AM, so finally at about 1:30 my wife
<br>
and daughter and I got in the car and drove up into the local hills.
<br>
It's only about 20 minutes to the top and the news had suggested that 
<br>
it would remain clear up there.
<br>
<p>It was a good idea, but the problem was that it seemed that half the
<br>
city had the same thought.  I've never seen it so crowded up there.
<br>
Every turnoff was packed full of cars.  There was bumper to bumper traffic
<br>
heading into the hills.  I was going to turn off on the ridge road to
<br>
the west, but I saw as many cars heading out as going in and I figured
<br>
that it must be full in there.  So we turned off on the east ridge road,
<br>
which didn't seem quite as crowded.
<br>
<p>Again it was the same story, every turnout packed full with a dozen or
<br>
more cars.  We drove on for about 15 minutes, getting more and more
<br>
discouraged.  Not only was it frustrating but I felt bad for all the
<br>
people parked there getting light-blasted by my headlights along with
<br>
all the other cars heading into the hills.
<br>
<p>Finally the traffic in front of us just ground to a halt.  The cars 
<br>
just stopped.  I guess somewhere up ahead people had parked in such a way
<br>
that you couldn't get through any more.  The guy in front of us turned
<br>
around, and I managed to maneuver our clumsy minivan through a 180.
<br>
At this point I was ready to head for home.  I hate crowds and it was
<br>
a madhouse up there.
<br>
<p>Then we came around a bend and found a turnout with an overgrown weedy
<br>
patch to the side where no one was parked.  It hadn't been visible on
<br>
the way up but coming down it was right there in front of us, so I was
<br>
able to slip right in.  We were able to walk a ways farther in across the
<br>
weeds and lay a thick blanket down so it was reasonably comfortable and
<br>
we were protected from some of the headlights by the shadow of our car.
<br>
<p>The sky was beautiful and the meteors were impressive.  I wouldn't
<br>
call it a &quot;storm&quot; but I'm sure we saw several hundred meteors in the
<br>
ninety minutes that we were up there.  Often we'd see two or three at
<br>
almost the same time, sometimems clusters of 5 or more in a few seconds.
<br>
Then there would be a lull of 30 seconds or so and then another set.
<br>
The meteors were bright and most left a glowing trail behind visible for
<br>
several seconds.  We saw one super-bright one that seemed to vanish with
<br>
a flash that was bright enough to light up the ground.
<br>
<p>The only problem was when things wound down a bit after three, everyone
<br>
else tried to leave at the same time.  We got caught in a jam-up where
<br>
people going up were blocked by cars backing into the road, and people
<br>
going down were blocked by cars coming up through narrow spots beside
<br>
other parked cars.  It was a mess and I had to get out of my car and
<br>
direct traffic for a minute to get it un-jammed so we could get out.
<br>
<p>It was a crazy night; I would never have dreamed that you would see
<br>
that kind of traffic on those twisty mountain roads at 2 in the morning.
<br>
I'm glad we got to see the Leonids, but I don't think I would do it again.
<br>
Still I know that we are lucky that we were able to drive to where it
<br>
was clear; many people were clouded out all night with no hope of seeing
<br>
the meteors.
<br>
