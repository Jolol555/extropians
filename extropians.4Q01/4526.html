</em><br>
<p>You should browse in your history book to a few pages earlier. There you 
<br>
will find which massive influence the former US governments (and the former 
<br>
Soviet Republic) had in that region. 
<br>
<p>At the beginning of the 70s, Afghanistan had an elected government and made 
<br>
slow progress to transform its middle aged clan structure into a more 
<br>
modern society. It has always been the target of external interests and 
<br>
influence, though.
<br>
<p>In the middle and late 70s the USA and the SU pumped loads of military 
<br>
&quot;aid&quot; into the country (military, not humanitarian), because both parties 
<br>
were interested to control and exploit the largest fields of natural gas in 
<br>
the middle east. They either wanted to sell it to Europe (the USA, instead 
<br>
of Europe buying Soviet gas) or (the SU) control the price for both 
<br>
resources.
<br>
<p>This destabilised the country more and more. In 79, the soviets invaded 
<br>
Afghanistan that the external influence had pushed on the brink of a civil 
<br>
war, but the USA didn't give in. The military resistance, the Mujahed, were 
<br>
trained by Pakistan and the USA. Again, loads of weapons were pumped into 
<br>
the country. Modern weapons, even Stinger missiles. Their leaders were 
<br>
trained by CIA people and - read this carefully - Osama bin Ladin was one 
<br>
of them and the US knew exactly who he was.
<br>
<p>The Mujahed were pushed by Pakistan and CIA - now comes the interesting 
<br>
part - to see the resistance as a islamic Djihad, a holy war of 
<br>
self-defense. The &quot;islamic rush&quot; in that region can therefore be seen as a 
<br>
direct result of the influence of the super powers.
<br>
<p>The Taliban appeared during the civil war between the clans that followed. 
<br>
They also got their share from the financial and military &quot;aid&quot; of the USA. 
<br>
I repeat: the Taliban got financial and military support from the USA. And 
<br>
if you ask why, it was (and is still) the natural resources.
<br>
<p>We could repeat this lesson for the Irak, Indonesia, Chile, etc. It always 
<br>
started with &quot;military aid&quot;, destabilizing governments to aquire influence, 
<br>
causing civil war, helping &quot;the right people&quot; into power. It ends with &quot;the 
<br>
right people&quot; becoming &quot;the wrong people&quot;, when they become too powerfull 
<br>
or overstress the limits set by the US (example: Saddam in Kuwait).
<br>
<p>It is never as simple as &quot;we did good, they did bad&quot;.
<br>
<p>BTW, not &quot;we&quot; (or &quot;you&quot;, the USA) sent aid workers. Nor did other western 
<br>
countries. These were NGOs. International groups, not directly supported by 
<br>
any government. &quot;Shelter Now&quot; is not neutral, but a christian group (see 
<br>
<a href="http://www.shelter.org/about.html">http://www.shelter.org/about.html</a>). While the Red Cross and many other 
<br>
organizations did their work, and even SNI worked in Afghanistan since 1979 
<br>
without major problems, one of their goals was &quot;to spread the word&quot;. This 
<br>
is not wise in a strict islamic country. There're many arabic countries, 
<br>
were christian mission is strictly forbidden. Saudi Arabia is one of them.
<br>
<p>Many Saudi Arabians also send a lot of money to islamic terror 
<br>
organizations. Should we go and bomb Saudi Arabia? Now, this will never 
<br>
happen, even if the FBI had found that the tickets for 9-11 were payed 
<br>
directly from the Saudi bank. My suspicion is, that &quot;we&quot; (the US and their 
<br>
followers) would lose too much (money and influence, that is). 
<br>
Unfortunately this was not the case in Afghanistan. Or at least it seems so 
<br>
on the first view.
