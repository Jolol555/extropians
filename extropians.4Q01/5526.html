<p>
|&gt; Now, feel free to state your comments. &quot;The audience is listening.&quot;
<br>
|
<br>
|Because some creatures are too irrational to be trusted with so
<br>
|much as an icepick doesn't mean that all beings are to be
<br>
|forbidden what in the hands of the utterly irrational and
<br>
|irresponsible is dangerous.  The assumption that no citizen
<br>
|should have what every citizen cannot be entrusted with is quite
<br>
|questionable.  The assumption that only citizens who have become
<br>
|part of the government should have what most citizens are not to
<br>
|be trusted with is also very questionable.
<br>
<p>Who gets to decide who &quot;are too irrational&quot;, then, I wonder.
<br>
<p>A citizen, you write.  So the local power mongers (''the Government'')
<br>
shall bludgeon all others to do their bidding, in your world model?
<br>
And the non-citizens become their slaves, I surmise.
