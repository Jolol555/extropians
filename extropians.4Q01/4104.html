<p>Ah, ok, but what energy is used by the nanoscale replicators to
<br>
replicate? They will metabolize a chunk of the energy as well, just as
<br>
the corn plants do.
<br>
<p>Now, putting on my devil's luddite hat again, we also need to evaluate
<br>
exactly what sort of system we think is appropriate for a given
<br>
environment. As the greenies say, there is no place on earth that is not
<br>
inhabited by life. What habitats do we decide are appropriate to subsume
<br>
with a nanobuilt solar energy field? If we are to value wild habitat as
<br>
most important (as a growing percentage of the people do), then we are
<br>
left with that land which we've already de-naturated: agricultural land
<br>
and developed areas. Most homeowners also want to live someplace that
<br>
looks as 'natural' as possible, so human living areas are of higher
<br>
value left alone than doing so to previously farmed areas.
<br>
<p>My personal preference is that there are only some places on earth which
<br>
can justify them being covered by solar power systems: the great
<br>
deserts: Sahara, Gobi, Kalahari, and the Outback. What is so great is
<br>
that there is already lots of silicon there to work with.
