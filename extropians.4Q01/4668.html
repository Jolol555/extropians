<p>What evidence? Invisible evidence that the accused and his/her

legal representation (if any is allowed) is not allowed to see

fail to see how that is anything but allowing the government to

torture whomever they please whenever they please.

</em><br>
<p>Actually, they deserve fundamental protections simply as human
<br>
beings.  If you don't think so then I don't see much point in
<br>
continuing this discussion.  War criminals are actually brought
<br>
before high courts in most of the cases I know of.  What
<br>
combatants?  Supsicion is not being a combatant.  Many held
<br>
today that the FBI worried wouldn't be cooperative and wished
<br>
they could use drugs or torture on (as &quot;just a thought&quot;) are not
<br>
even suspected of being in any way involved of anything
<br>
themselves except having an expired visa.  But the suspicion is
<br>
&quot;they know something&quot;.  This is a witch hunt and does not belong
<br>
in any civilized country and especially not this one.
<br>

<em>&gt; Apparently, you still have not seen the videotape where bin Laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confesses his guilt and that of his organization. If after seeing it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are still not convinced that al Qaeda and the Taliban are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epitome of evil and need to be wiped out, then there really is no hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for rational discourse with you.
</em><br>
<p>That, is irrelevant to the main point.  Even if this tape is the
<br>
truth (which is questionable until examined by independent
<br>
experts), it still would not prove that anyone is the &quot;epitome
<br>
of evil&quot;.  That *is* a pointless construction.  If admissible
<br>
evidence, it is strong evidence that bin Laden is behind 9/11
<br>
along with at least some parts of Al Qaeda.  But the Taliban,
<br>
despite their obvious odiousness, are only guilty by
<br>
association.  They agreed to have bin Laden in the country and
<br>
supposedly had required (but obviously not adequately enforced)
<br>
limitations on his activities.  Oh, and they didn't turn him
<br>
over when we demanded it or else.  Do you honestly expect all
<br>
right thinking people to believe that this is sufficient that
<br>
all of them should be killed?  Or will just removing them from
<br>
power be sufficient?
