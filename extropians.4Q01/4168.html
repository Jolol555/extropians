<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say that the most unique thing to come out of the '90s that hadn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been done before in music, was proper Drum 'n' Bass (e.g. LTJ Bukem and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Talvin Singh).  Most of the other &quot;new&quot; genres were barely distinguishable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deviations of existing stuff, such that the differences probably fall below
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the noise floor of normal differences between given artists in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genre.
</em><br>
<p>Jeremy says:  I would go further to say that it is the Jungle variant on Drum 
<br>
N Bass that actually begins to sound more like its own original genre.  The 
<br>
basic DNB pattern is really just a glorified 8 beat rock pattern or 16 beat 
<br>
rock pattern played quite often in cut time which then only makes the timbes 
<br>
fresh sounding.  With the syncopated Jungle, Arabic and Indian time 
<br>
signatures were making their way into western dance culture so to me, that is 
<br>
more fundamentally &quot;new&quot; than basic DNB.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; James Said: Question for the drummers:  Why does sloppy drummer timing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound &quot;organic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and sloppy MIDI timing sound &quot;sloppy&quot;?  I don't hear a difference, but I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen it justified this way many times.  Drummers that actually have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent timing (i.e. sub-millisecond) are extremely rare, so perhaps it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way of justifying abilities that are less than excellent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Jeremy Says:  I agree with you and disagree with all the so-called drummers 
<br>
that make the claim you state.  As a drummer for a number of years (with 
<br>
praised technical ability supposedly), I still think that you have pointed 
<br>
out the basic insecurity that drummers can develop when their performing egos 
<br>
outweigh compositional concerns.  I used to like MIDI for its time lag though.
