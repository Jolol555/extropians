<br>
<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Space, the last frontier remaining to be truly explored 
<br>
and exploited by man. Vast mineral riches are believed to lie in its cold 
<br>
depths, especially on the moon -- an untapped resource just waiting for its 
<br>
first commercial landing.
<br>
<p>Could it ever be possible to replenish the earth's supplies of gemstones and 
<br>
little-known rare metals such as osmium and rhodium by sending humans, or 
<br>
even robots, into space to set up mining ventures on the inhospitable surface 
<br>
of the moon?
<br>
<p>An increasing number of private firms see no reason to wait for the world's 
<br>
governments to take the lead and are racing to launch their own space mining 
<br>
missions.
<br>
<p>``Governments have no reason to go back to the moon. They've been there, 
<br>
there's no political reason to go back. But there are a lot of private 
<br>
reasons to go back,'' said Ian Randal Strock, a director of U.S.-based 
<br>
Artemis Society International (ASI).
<br>
<p>ASI is helping sponsor a project to build a commercial manned moon base and 
<br>
plans its first lunar flight in the next 10 years. According to Strock, 
<br>
technology is not the problem -- rather, just how to raise the massive 
<br>
amounts of cash required.
<br>
<p>``If we had sufficient money, then it's just a matter of getting the pieces 
<br>
together, getting a launch and we're there. The big delay in any project to 
<br>
the moon is funding,'' he said.
<br>
<p>``We're looking at $1.5 billion for that first flight,'' he said. ``We have 
<br>
four companies up and running and making money, and we're looking to send up 
<br>
a robotic camera in two years.''
<br>
<p>The United Nations (news - web sites)' 1979 Moon Treaty, one of several 
<br>
international outer space agreements, attempted to define the scope of 
<br>
private space activity. However, it was never ratified by some major powers 
<br>
such as Russia and the United States.
<br>
<p>The treaty stipulated that any wealth obtained from the moon by any 
<br>
space-faring nation was to be distributed to all the people of the world. One 
<br>
clause, referring to space resources as the ``common heritage of mankind,'' 
<br>
has been taken by private firms as legitimizing efforts to mine on the moon 
<br>
and asteroids.
<br>
<p>The handful of private firms competing to be the first to establish 
<br>
commercial lunar mining are convinced of a lucrative market for whatever they 
<br>
might eventually ship back to Earth.
<br>
<p>To back up their claims, they cite a famous sale of Russian lunar samples 
<br>
held at a New York Sotheby's auction in 1993, where a pebble of moon rock 
<br>
weighing less than one carat fetched an astounding $442,000, or $2,200 a 
<br>
milligram. According to Applied Space Resources (ASR), a moon mission costing 
<br>
less than $100 million could return a quantity of lunar material with enough 
<br>
demand in the marketplace to make the return on investment attractive to 
<br>
financial backers.
<br>
<p>A private company based in New York state, ASR aims to send an unmanned 
<br>
spacecraft to an unexplored region of the moon and return the first lunar 
<br>
samples to earth in more than 25 years.
<br>
<p>``We have been at this for four years now -- we can do this technologically 
<br>
and we believe that the market exists,'' said Denise Norris, ASR's president. 
<br>
``The biggest hurdle is that we need about three to three and a half years to 
<br>
integrate everything.
<br>
<p>``If everything moves on schedule, we would be launching within five years,'' 
<br>
she said, adding that ASR would soon be looking for $4 million in financing.
<br>
<p>SCARCE METALS
<br>
<p>Scientists believe the elements making up most of the earth are also present 
<br>
on the moon and make up most of its composition. Analysis of lunar rock 
<br>
samples indicates a wide variety of elements, with oxygen and silicon being 
<br>
relatively plentiful.
<br>
<p>Germanium, molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium and gold rank among the rarer metals 
<br>
present, in small percentages. Cobalt, nickel, iron, aluminum, magnesium, 
<br>
manganese, calcium, sodium and titanium also feature.
<br>
<p>But of more immediate commercial interest are the six elements known as the 
<br>
Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) -- iridium, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhodium 
<br>
and ruthenium.
<br>
<p>Among the world's scarcest metals, the PGMs possess unique chemical and 
<br>
physical qualities that make them vital industrial materials. They are 
<br>
especially valued for their catalytic functions, conductivity and resistance 
<br>
to corrosion. ``There are certain minerals and precious metals that we are 
<br>
going to find where the supply is going to drop off soon,'' said ASR's 
<br>
Norris. ''I believe that the platinum group metals are going to be a real 
<br>
problem on earth, with fuel-cell technology.''
<br>
<p>Fuel-cells, which are being developed to operate without fossil fuels, use 
<br>
around 10 times more platinum than internal combustion engines, mainly as a 
<br>
catalyst. If they were to be in widespread use, platinum demand would rocket.
<br>
<p>Norris added, ``but it'd be extremely foolish to say we're going to make a 
<br>
ton of money selling platinum group metals here. The resources are there and 
<br>
there's a lot of stuff up there,'' she said, adding that this was mostly from 
<br>
asteroid impacts on the moon.
<br>
<p>PRACTICAL PROBLEMS
<br>
<p>However, the daunting number of practical problems facing a would-be moon 
<br>
miner may prove insurmountable, scientists say.
<br>
<p>The largest obstacle is the lack of water, used in large quantities in most 
<br>
earth mining operations but only believed to exist as ice at the lunar poles. 
<br>
Water has been responsible for shaping the earth with its alluvial strata and 
<br>
mineral deposits.
<br>
<p>Notwithstanding a similar lack of oxygen, which does exist on the moon but is 
<br>
bound up in compounds that are hard to break down, the low-gravity situation 
<br>
means that robotic mining would probably be more sustainable than sending 
<br>
humans into space.
<br>
<p>``Nobody is going to think of doing (moon) mining with human beings,'' said 
<br>
Richard Taylor, a council member of the British Interplanetary Society.
<br>
<p>``We aren't going to have little men with tin hats holding picks in their 
<br>
hands,'' he said. ``All this exploitation of asteroid material will be 
<br>
robotic and remote.''
<br>
<p>Finding the actual mineral deposits could also prove tricky.
<br>
<p>While the earth concentrates minerals in specific areas by dint of volcanic 
<br>
eruptions, the moon is volcanically inactive so new ways of locating minerals 
<br>
would have to be found.
<br>
<p>So far, there is little hard evidence about in what form or where minerals 
<br>
are found on the moon, although scientists have made educated guesses based 
<br>
upon studies of lunar soil and rock samples.
<br>
<p>``What you want is a means of establishing what exists where, and whether 
<br>
there are local concentrations. That requires very comprehensive mineral 
<br>
mapping,'' Taylor said.
<br>
<p>``The moon has a semi-molten core but we're not going to see crystal 
<br>
formation or those types of veining that you would see on the earth with 
<br>
precious metals,'' said ASR's Norris. ``There is no crystallization in the 
<br>
same way that we see on earth.''
<br>
<p>EXORBITANT COSTS
<br>
<p>Apart from the serious practical problems involved with any activity on the 
<br>
lunar surface, the first obstacle for companies looking to mine on the moon 
<br>
is cost -- and return on investment.
<br>
<p>Experts say the cost of transporting items into space is exorbitant, ranging 
<br>
between $2,000 and $3,000 per pound of weight, meaning that any lunar bases 
<br>
would really have to be able to procure their necessities from space.
<br>
<p>``If there was a layer of gold a foot thick floating over the earth at an 
<br>
altitude at which we could send up a shuttle to go up and collect, it 
<br>
wouldn't be worth doing it,'' said Taylor.
<br>
<p>``This is for the simple reason that it would cost more per gram to go up and 
<br>
bring the gold back than the gold would actually fetch,'' he said. ``And a 
<br>
lot of these metals have high values on earth only because they are rare.''
<br>
<p>The real key to lunar mining, Taylor said, was to reduce the cost of sending 
<br>
a craft into space so that its operators could afford to have a vehicle which 
<br>
went up partially empty into space and came back
