</em><br>
<p>This is a good point, and it applies to any sort of reproductive
<br>
engineering technology, beyond just cloning.  Who is responsible for
<br>
a newborn baby?  Babies need someone to care for them for many years.
<br>
No child should be born but to a parent that will love them and take
<br>
care of them.
<br>
<p>Louis suggests that a company would create a clone and perhaps somehow
<br>
assume responsibility for it.  But this is contrary to our understanding
<br>
of human emotional needs.  A company cannot raise a child, that must be
<br>
done by one or more loving individuals who form a personal bond with him
<br>
or her.  Corporate structures are based on roles where the individuals who
<br>
fill those positions are somewhat interchangeable.  This is inconsistent
<br>
with the kinds of personal, biological relationships that a growing
<br>
child requires.  But I think many people will share Louis' perspective
<br>
that cloning suggests a sort of factory based creation of living human
<br>
beings.  This is not acceptable given our current understanding of what
<br>
babies need.
<br>
<p>Likewise Louis' idea that there would be some question about clones'
<br>
rights suggests that these are in some sense manufactured objects rather
<br>
than human babies.  In fact it seems clear that clones should have the
<br>
same rights as any other person.
<br>
<p>Then there is the issue of genetic contributions.  Today we hold people
<br>
responsible, at least financially, who have made a genetic contribution to
<br>
a child, even when they did not want the child to be born and would have
<br>
wanted to see it aborted at a pre-sentient state.  Even when people have
<br>
voluntarily contributed genetic material to a child they don't raise, as
<br>
when a woman gives a child up for adoption, or when a man contributes to
<br>
a sperm bank, they will often feel curiosity or even guilt, wondering how
<br>
&quot;their&quot; child is faring in the world.  Their genetic contribution gives
<br>
them a sense of responsibility even if they have chosen to ignore it.
<br>
<p>If cloning becomes possible from mature cells, then in principle any one
<br>
of our cells could be turned into a child.  Since we spread cells around
<br>
all the time, it means that in principle we could have genetic children
<br>
all over the world and not know about it.  Cloning could be done without
<br>
parental consent and raises difficult issues about responsibility for
<br>
the resulting children.  Could you get stuck with a maternity/paternity
<br>
suit if your genetic child or clone showed up one day?
