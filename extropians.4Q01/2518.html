<em>&gt; What are 'fundies?' And PCR?

<em>&gt; IDAUATA---I mean---'I Don't Always Understand All the Abbreviations'
</em><br>
<p>Kindly scroll down to the bottom for the punchline of this email.
<br>
<p>Answer 1) 1 &quot;Fundies&quot; is short, deprecative for &quot;fundamentalists&quot;.
<br>
<p>The most mainstream use of the word is by &quot;progressives&quot; putting down
<br>
right wing wacko southern babtizts. I use the word more generally, to
<br>
refer to fundamentalists including Christians (Xtians, some call them),
<br>
Wahhabists, and people who believe that all God's plan is revealed in
<br>
the print of some wizened sage's left pinky toe, and that unbelievers
<br>
are controlling things and will or should be smited by God or his children.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Sidebar:
<br>
As an interesting aside, I have recently gained a deeper understanding
<br>
of another root cause of Judaism's treatment by Xtianity and Islam.
<br>
I heard on the radio (need to research further) that Talmudic rabbis
<br>
have written that there might be more than one path to heaven. Dangerous
<br>
to any struggling proselytizing my-way-or-the-highway faith. I can name
<br>
a couple of those, and I'm sure you can, too.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Answer 2) PCR means at least two things.
<br>
<p>PCR(1): The ExI philosophical variety.
<br>
In the subject context, it's short for Pan-Critical Rationalism,
<br>
the shortened but only slightly snappier term for what Bartley
<br>
originally called &quot;Comprehensively Critical Rationalism&quot;--I think
<br>
I have that right, the book is out of reach just at the moment.
<br>
<p>The goal of Bartley, a young Xtian philosopher(/theologian-by-the-side-door, was
<br>
to find a way for rationalism and honest inquiry to be a part of deep, true Christianity. 
<br>
<p>_Very interesting concept_.
<br>
<p>Somewhat confusingly, the title of the book is _Retreat to Commitment_.
<br>
It's a slippery title--is he advocating some sort of retreat? Is &quot;commitment&quot; 
<br>
some sort of setback? Is this title a play on the &quot;religious retreats&quot; (weekends
<br>
or weeks spent in the woods) that were catching on in the '60s? What? What?
<br>
<p>I haven't digested the book, but my take on his approach is approximately:
<br>
1) hunkering down in commitment is what you do when you turn off your brain, and 
<br>
2) God doesn't want you to turn off your brain--he created your brain in his image, too; and 
<br>
3) there is an _antidote_ or _vaccine_ for fundamentalism; and
<br>
4) this vaccination doesn't flop over into utter &quot;whatever, maaaan!&quot; relativism. so:
<br>
5) God doesn't have to die just because you wonder about that whole Jonah deal.
<br>
<p>Thus its current import.
<br>
<p>Since the 60s, some smart atheists have figured out that even Xtians have good ideas
<br>
every so often. :) They suggest that the path Popper-Kuhn-Bartley is a useful way out of
<br>
the secular relativist trap, too.
<br>
<p>This kind of PCR is a part of the Extropian guiding principles, if I recall correctly.
<br>
<p>PCR(0): The techie term.
<br>
In genetics and current events, PCR is Polymerase Chain Reaction,
<br>
a method of &quot;Xeroxing&quot; chemical samples (DNA and RNA, particularly)
<br>
to produce a large amount from a small representative trace. 
<br>
<p>I've mentioned it to you &lt;Acquaintance&gt; recently in a &quot;how dey do dat?&quot; thread.
<br>
<p>BIG CONCLUSION: We need to do Memetic PCR(0) on PCR(1). Heh.
<br>
