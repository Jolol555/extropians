Smigrodzki, Rafal wrote (17.12.2001/16:02) :
<br>
<em>&gt; Suppose a scientist analyzes your body, and makes two identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies, Rafal #2 and Rafal #3, while you are re-named Rafal #1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose he is very evil (« science sans conscience », you know), has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun and tells you « I will now kill, either you Rafal #1, or the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others #2 and #3 ; you choose. » What will you choose ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The position you just stated seems to imply you must choose to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed ; while I rather think you will choose to survive and have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two copies killed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Maybe you will find it hard to believe me, but I would prefer to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed rather than to have both of my copies killed - assuming that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies would be set free, they would have a better chance of avenging my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death (by working together) than me alone. Lee Corbin, who used to post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, asked the list the same question (in a slightly different thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment), and I was one of only 3 persons who gave this answer. And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really gave some thought to trying to imagine my emotional state in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation you describe, always with the same results.
</em><br>
<p><p>You guessed it : I find it hard to believe ; and I suspect that
<br>
something unessential in this setup accounts for your imagined
<br>
emotional state.
<br>
<p>So to make my point even harder to escape, suppose that it starts like
<br>
above, except that you are free, all the three of you, and #2 and #3,
<br>
for some reason unknown to you, are trying to kill you. Suppose the
<br>
only way to avoid being killed is to kill them. What will you do ?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Should we imagine that ? Should we keep the parallelism and imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutations arising in the copies, so that the desire to be copied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes more and more natural, and people in the end become MAINLY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned with self-copy as we have long been with procreation ? How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you see a future with this technology available ? (this is by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, not as an objection to your position of course)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### The basic feature which will shape the future will be the ability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities to survive under the prevalent circumstances - this is no different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the way the world has been ever since its beginning. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unbridled growth is under some circumstances a good strategy - e.g bacteria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a rich broth. In other circumstances it becomes self-destructive - koala
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bears on some small islands off the coast of Australia multiply until they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devour all the eukalyptus trees and cause the death of all of them. In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society there have to be very stringent limits on growth of its components,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the more complex the society, the more stringent the control (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highest level of control is needed in organisms like our bodies, or else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancers develop).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally I would not see unlimited copying as an end in itself, instead it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a means of prolonging survival. The number of copies should be large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to prevent all of them being killed in one accident
</em><br>
<p><p>This is just the way I see it. However, I don't find it very
<br>
consistent with what you previously said, ie having thousands of you,
<br>
and employers being able of hiring a bunch of you for some tasks, etc.
<br>
Maybe you got carried away by the fun of the thought ? :-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; but not too large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to strain the available resources or dangerously reduce mental diversity.
</em><br>
<p><p>As you know such considerations are useless on a personal scale : if
<br>
you do restrain yourself in order not to reduce mental diversity, you
<br>
will simply be outnumbered by someone who will not restrain himself.
<br>
(see below for social control)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Presumably, once copying becomes possible, the society will have to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways of controlling it - otherwise one entity could spawn to displace all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other entities. Such an uncontrolled replicator would be dangerous to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other entities and the society would need to destroy vis or render vis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incapable of copying verself. On the other hand, replicators with good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms for limiting growth might be very useful for the society as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole - e.g by providing standardized professional services without the need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for laborious learning and monitoring. 
</em><br>
<p><p>The social control of autocopy (self-copy) seems to be 1) practically
<br>
impossible 2) contrary to freedom and self ownership. (Of course, in
<br>
the limits of respecting others, that is, not disassembling them to
<br>
assemble more copies of you.)
<br>
<p>So it would seem that if autocopy becomes feasible and nanotech
<br>
efficiency happens as expected, we will have such an evolution. While
<br>
autocopy is not a goal in itself for you, the world will quietly fill
<br>
with mutants for whom it is. With an open world (space) this might be
<br>
OK after all.
<br>
<p>Our evolution-inherited taste for variety might somehow auto-regulate
<br>
this as we won't enjoy living with autocopies.
<br>
<p>If the value system is changed, then the regulation might come, in the
<br>
presence of big challenges, from intrinsic inferiority of lack of
<br>
variety, which is why we inherited taste for variety in the first
<br>
place.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This I find very weird indeed, Rafal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The brain emerged and evolved to coordinate the body. For you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identify now with your information processing ability seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problematic to me, and I suspect you are victim of an illusion there :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you identify on a conceptual level to this, but this may be because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you neglect other aspects of yourself that you would quickly miss. (to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say the least)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Our arms initially evolved to help our ancestors crawl out of the ocean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now they are used to transmit information about the mind's difficulties with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding itself, as in typing emails.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is not very different from crawling.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sometimes the tail starts wagging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dog. It happens again and again that structures and processes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diverted to different uses in the course of evolution. 
</em><br>
<p><p>In all these cases, something was reinterpreted by the whole body to
<br>
serve the purposes of the body. This is just like using a kitchen
<br>
knife to defend yourself against an intruder.
<br>
<p>What's different here is : that around which everything revolved (the
<br>
body), and was the foundation of all goals and values, is suppressed.
<br>
What emerged as a better control mechanism is detached from what it
<br>
controls, and imagined to pursue a life of its own.
<br>
<p>It's like the people in the control tower saying : ok, all these
<br>
planes are nice, but sometimes there are crashes, hijacking, etc. --
<br>
wouldn'it be nicer if we get rid of the planes ? What we really are is
<br>
not the planes. We are the Tower. Let's exist as a tower, without the
<br>
burden of the planes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Once the apeman stopped knuckle-walking, it became possible to neglect this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of the the forelegs and new uses could develop. I do think that I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discard some parts of my mind which might no longer be useful to a copied or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disembodied sentience. Soon we will be able to switch off and modify parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our brains, see how the whole works in practice, and then revert to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial design (if we miss what we got rid of) or try new changes, 
</em><br>
<p><p>You may underestimate the hopelesness in which you will be to make any
<br>
such choice.
<br>
<p>You orient yourself on evolution-given affective clues. Won't you be
<br>
lost when you start changing yourself ? People cannot even control
<br>
their lifes if they take little drugs, so that they quickly consider
<br>
it an error and make cures to stop. Any change like the ones you
<br>
propose will be many times more drastic than any drugs. It will
<br>
totally mess with your million years super-sound stratified
<br>
organization, and you will have no clue how to regain equilibrium,
<br>
unless by getting back to normal.
<br>
<p>What I rather expect (now) -- and that's the way I understand
<br>
transhumanism -- is a continuation of our evolution. We won't recreate
<br>
ourselves arbitrarily, we will keep pursuing our values by new means,
<br>
because this is the meaning of our lifes, out of which we would get
<br>
lost, loosing interest in ourselves.
<br>
<p>The modification of our goals is something we have yet to think about
<br>
in a serious way : for on what base could we choose our goals, except
<br>
on the existing evolution-given ones ?
<br>
<p>I think it is important to acknowledge how deeply we are rooted in
<br>
this, and not be deceived by superficial self images.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; How come does one get to the stage of an animal with a centralized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nervous system to help him to adapt to a stage where the animal IS the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centralized nervous system. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I guess you need to make the CVS portable - adaptable to functioning in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many bodies, perhaps wirelessly networked. This will be a whole new science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;autopsychoengineering&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>We already do something like that when we drive a car, for example.
<br>
<p>However, we only drive cars for seconding our body's goals, or for fun.
<br>
<p>I am not the car-animal I become when driving. I am the Jacques-animal
<br>
(*roar*).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Does &quot;centralized nervous system&quot; even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean anything outside of a body ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### If you mean existence without a material substrate, then it doesn't (at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least I think so). If you mean existence without direct access to physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulators, then yes - it means the ability to analyze and integrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available information and produce more or less useful thoughts.
</em><br>
<p><p>They might be useful to others, but not to you if you have no physical
<br>
manipulators. You may function as a brain slave. (for a few days,
<br>
after which your creativity falls to zero as you loose interest in
<br>
yourself)
<br>
<p>I am aware that much of our mental lifes is not directly linked to
<br>
behaviour, like listening to music or reflecting about &quot;minds without
<br>
bodies&quot;. But I suspect it is essentially though indirectly linked to
<br>
it all the same.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Beautifully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explored by Greg Egan in &quot;Diaspora&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>It's a shame I have that SF allergy.
<br>
<p>Should I remove it in my remake ?
<br>
<p>The trouble is, I don't see it as a handicap, it is there for some
<br>
reason, it has a meaning in my development, linked to my appreciation
<br>
of literature. So I don't want to remove it more than I want to
<br>
program into myself interest for things I am not interested in. It
<br>
would be meaningless.
<br>
<p>This illustrates my point : I am willing to replace my deffective
<br>
(from my current point of view) parts, to augment myself, to
<br>
complement myself in order to reach the goals that make sense to me. I
<br>
want to get rid of toothache (and of the need of brushing them,
<br>
too !), and other similar pains, I don't want to die and I want to
<br>
keep developing indefinitely along the lines of my desires and
<br>
interests, possibly accelerating the pace of development.
<br>
<p>But I am far from being ready to recreate myself arbitrarily like God
<br>
is thought by Christian to have created man.
<br>
<p>Maybe THIS could be what we should discuss / think about. But it is
<br>
probably very difficult.
<br>
<p>Goals were brought by evolution, and all our talks revolve around them,
<br>
starting with the will to avoid death. It is our passive animation by
<br>
goals that provides meaning to our lifes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Is it any use at all ? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Use for whom? For the CNS itself - yes, as long as it wants to live. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others - yes, as long as it produces useful thoughts.
</em><br>
<p><p>It's funny that you really identify to your CNS.
<br>
<p>The very concept of the CNS to want something appears deffective to
<br>
me. People want things in a sophisticated way partly implemented by
<br>
their CNS. CNS doesn't want anything. WANTING is something people are
<br>
regarded as doing, not CNS.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What will you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DO ? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Learn. Learn how learn more. Recursively self-enhance. Hog as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational and physical resources as I can ethically gain access to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Listen to music. Return to my body for a nostalgic natural experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes. The list is infinite.
</em><br>
<p><p>It's funny that one thing you list, as sample of the &quot;infinite list&quot; of
<br>
what you will do when you are a mind without a body, is returning to
<br>
your body.
<br>
<p>I think you should question your self-identification to your CNS. I
<br>
submit to you that you are given to yourself by introspection as
<br>
something wich is only a superficial part of yourself, and that your
<br>
identification to your CNS is a &quot;physicalization&quot; of this.
<br>
<p>If your wife/girlfriend tells you she loves you, you may make a
<br>
spectral analysis of the voice sample in which she said that and think
<br>
that this is the actual shape of your happiness ; but you would be
<br>
misled.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will you program into yourself goals not linked with your body ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Based on what ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I don't know the details now but I would imagine that the quest for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, power, and beauty will play an important role.
</em><br>
<p><p>You never &quot;know the details&quot; when you build something on
<br>
introspection.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You're not a &quot;dualist&quot;, thinking that you really are a soul
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trapped in a body ? « Soma sèma » [the body is a grave] ? Back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Descartes, or in fact Plato ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### God forbid, no! ;-/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am moderately comfortable in my body as it is now but I do see its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limitations and I want to transcend them (that's why I am posting on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanist list).
</em><br>
<p><p>I share this view and desire, and this is why I'm here, too.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The very phrase &quot;an embodiement of me&quot; that you use in your message
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems wrong to me, it is the kind of fallacy made by people believing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in reincarnation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### It is a fallacy only if you believe in an immaterial entity hovering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above your brain and magically keeping it conscious.
</em><br>
<p><p>You may swear you are not a dualist, you may know many details about
<br>
the brain as a neurologist -- and still think like Descartes, which, I
<br>
have to say, I think you do ! (Descartes was not a fool, by the way,
<br>
he was a genius)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experience of being conscious is a natural effect of certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information processing tasks in my brain, and if the same tasks are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materially analyzed and implemented in another brain, the subjective effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be the same.
</em><br>
<p><p>I used to think that way, but I wouldn't phrase things that way anymore.
<br>
<p>Not because I think that there is something MORE to the mind than the
<br>
material body.
<br>
<p>But because I think that the core of what we call consciousness is
<br>
simply the perception that a body has of himself.
<br>
<p>By body I don't mean flesh necessarily ; when you run a program the
<br>
computer is the body. (no real program running without computer ; the
<br>
computer program outside of any body is an abstraction, just like
<br>
another text)
<br>
<p>To get an idea of what it feels to be a computer running a certain
<br>
program, you'll have to ask the computer. You probably won't make a
<br>
lot of sense of what he tells you, as we understand each other because
<br>
we suppose we feel the same. And if you have taken the responsability
<br>
of defining most of his concepts, it will be even less useful to ask
<br>
him.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  You are a body (with information processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities among others), not something embodied. You are given to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself, in introspection, as a mind. But that is not what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually are. This mind is just a useful illusion to help the body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take care of itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Is your own conscious self an illusion?? This statement really baffles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me - I find it inconceivable that one could doubt one's own existence (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the word illusion is used here in the usual meaning - something that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real, does not exist). The mind for me is the one thing that I cannot deny,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under any circumstances, while I could imagine my body as nothing more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few mathematical equations in a simulator.
</em><br>
<p><p>Isn't it funny (again, sorry) that you seem to reproduce the own words
<br>
of Descartes ? :-)
<br>
<p>What I meant to say is not that your existence is an illusion. The
<br>
illusion is that you are the way you perceive yourself by
<br>
introspection.
<br>
<p>Remember that your cognitive apparatus evolved to augment your
<br>
fitness, and, to that end, to allow you to keep track of what happens
<br>
in the surrounding world and make good decisions. Not to do
<br>
neurosciences through introspection.
<br>
<p>This is why I said that the fact that you are your mind is an illusion
<br>
of introspection (from latin roots deceptively meaning : looking into
<br>
oneself).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You cannot separate it from the body it is part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Not yet.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think you can NEVER separate the mind from the body it is &quot;in&quot; (to
<br>
use your phrasing), for the simple reason that a mind without a body
<br>
is an abstraction, like a text without an edition.
<br>
<p>You may identify to this abstraction in the sense that you clearly do
<br>
not identify to some other parts of your body. For example, whether
<br>
your nails are long or short does not affect what you essentially are.
<br>
<p>But from there you should not jump to the idea that you can exist
<br>
without a body, or simply that you are something else than a body. You
<br>
are not ; which doesn't mean that you cannot transform your body in
<br>
any imaginable way, nor make copies of yourself that share some or
<br>
even all of your essential properties.
<br>
<p>Suppose there is only one car in the world, and you are this car. Take
<br>
all the other cars that you know as possible non essential variations
<br>
on the car that you are. Obviously you can have your lights replaced
<br>
by more powerful ones, that won't affect what you essentially are. SO
<br>
you can try to focus on what you essentially are.
<br>
<p>But now try to make sense of sentences uttered by the car like &quot;Soon,
<br>
I will set free from the car I am in.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Some more thoughts :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe in continuity of consciousness being a condition for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual survival, because I don't believe in continuity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness at all. Wheter you have taken 250 micrograms of Propofol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per minute or not seems irrelevant to me. Continuity is a fable for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyday people, too. At each moment we have the ability of recalling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who we are, and this is what produces this notion of continuity, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is an illusion. It is a bit the same illusion you have with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visual field : you think you see much more than you actually do,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply because when you want to check that you see something in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peripheral visual field, then you look at it and you see it, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you never get conscious of any hole in the visual field (in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way as you are able to recall what's your name, where you live, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do for a living, etc.) You need an experimental setup to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indirectly realize that there really are holes in you visual field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can never SEE the holes. (an absence of perception doesn't produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the perception of an absence)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### You actually touched on a very large and complex set of questions here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our subjective feeling of a unitary personality is dependent on a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of separate processes being coordinated. Signals propagate from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visual cortex to the amygdala to be analyzed for emotionally laden content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as in the sight of a snake ready to bite), other signals go to parietal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cortex to build and update a system of spatial maps (body-centered,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye-centered, observed-independent, and many others). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These data can be used for various motor responses, sometimes initiated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only parts of our mind fully updated - as in the startle response to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; snake. Other responses involve the frontal cortex - as in the inreased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apportionment of computational resources if a puzzle or an IQ test are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyzed. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a marvel that under most circumstances we have the feeling of all our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactions smoothly evolving in synchronization with others. This is not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion - it is a real neural network gathering data from it's subnetworks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only the naive conceptualization of this reality as a &quot;pinpoint&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indivisible entity, the Cartesian homunculus, is an illusion. Continuity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal experience does exist but it is not what the naive observer might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think.
</em><br>
<p><p>Our cognitive apparatus is here to give us the
<br>
continuity/discontinuity of that which we perceive -- not of our
<br>
perception.
<br>
<p>So I wouldn't say &quot;Continuity of personal experience does exist&quot;. That
<br>
which exist is the continuity of what we experience (be it oneself or
<br>
something else), not of the experience itself. I you turn around an
<br>
object and look at it, and the object is standing still, then you will
<br>
experience no discontinuity because your cognitive system serves to
<br>
report what happens in the world. But in the meantime, your perception
<br>
itself is all but continuous. Your perception of continuity results
<br>
from a discontinuous perception, which is possible because perception
<br>
is not something like a film you would be watching ; it IS &quot;watching&quot;.
<br>
It's exactly the same for the continuity of &quot;self-consciousness&quot;. What
<br>
makes it feel &quot;continous&quot; is that no discontinuity is &quot;reported&quot; to
<br>
you as such by your self-cognitive apparatus. So it's really hopeless
<br>
to take this as a criterion for personality survival (and we agree on
<br>
this, if not for the same reason).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ### Looks like we are not so far from each other after all. Good.
</em><br>
<p><p>We converge insofar as we both like the idea of the Jacques / Rafal-adventure
<br>
going on, even if we are, as a singular body, to die.
<br>
<p>We diverge insofar as you conflate this with your own survival, while
<br>
I keep them distinct.
<br>
<p>The possibility of abstracting some aspect of you as essential exists
<br>
(though it is a bit arbitrary) ; but thinking that this abstraction is
<br>
you seems an error to me, an error for which there is a psychological
<br>
explanation (the illusion of introspection), so that, while I do not
<br>
want to force you to believe anything, I question the fact that, once
<br>
you clear your mind about it, you will still believe it.
<br>
<p><p>My goal here is not to show that what people dream of is impossible. I
<br>
come here with my own dreams, too. I just want to check dreams for
<br>
soundness because even more than dreaming dreams I like to realize
<br>
them. :-)
<br>
<p><p>Best
<br>
<p><p>Jacques
