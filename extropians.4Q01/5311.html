not trust the system.  Not that unrealistic an attitude.

<p><em>&gt; fugitive, a suspect is far less likely to be granted bail, etc. as a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It depends.  Someone who took flight might be denied bail
<br>
legitimately but this does not mean they have less rights than
<br>
they did before.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Detaining those who have violated the terms of their visa are justly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being detained because they are, at the very least, flight risks, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they are not participants in an actual terrorist plot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  Most people who run past their visas are not flight
<br>
risk and haven't run anywhere.  And they are certainly not
<br>
justifiably detained outside of normal conventions of having
<br>
people know their whereabouts, having legal representation and
<br>
knowing the precise charges against them.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The claim that they are being denied access to lawyers is not true. Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refuse to accept court appointed lawyers but do not have the means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hire lawyers of their own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am sorry but there is quite a bit of testimony that many of
<br>
them were denied lawyers and in some cases even their lawyers
<br>
had no idea of their location or the charges, if any, against
<br>
them.  There is no point in your claim this is a lie.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Nor does being held for military tribunals strip one of a right to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyer. Because, though, it is a military court, the lawyers are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of the JAG corps (i.e. US military officers), which I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect some foreigners would be hesitant to accept as defense counsel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I, a citizen, would be &quot;hesitant&quot; to accept such counsel.  And
<br>
there are many other high irregularities with a military
<br>
tribunal including not being able to know the charges or full
<br>
evidence against you in order to present any sort of real
<br>
defense.  All of this has been gone over before.  I am surprised
<br>
and not very happy that you choose to sweep it under the rug to
<br>
once again try to get your positions accepted.  This is, in my
<br>
opinion, very dishonest.
