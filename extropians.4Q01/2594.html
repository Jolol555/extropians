Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software
<br>
By Steven Johnson. Scribner, 288 pages, $25.00
<br>
<p>It's easy to see why there aren't more books like Steven Johnson's Emergence:
<br>
Only Johnson knows how to write them. Johnson was a founder and editor of
<br>
Feed, one of the Web's first and best &quot;zines&quot; (now moribund, unfortunately,
<br>
thanks to the economic downturn). Feed aimed to show that there was no
<br>
contradiction between maintaining high literary standards and creating online
<br>
community, and it succeeded, in large part, because Johnson himself is both
<br>
media savvy and a skilled writer. Johnson's first book, Interface Culture
<br>
(1997), was probably the single most memorable volume to come out of the
<br>
Internet explosion of the 1990s. It was an intellectually bold, often
<br>
exhilarating read, full of unexpected perspectives on culture and digital
<br>
media. The new book is exactly the volume Johnson needed to write next. It
<br>
takes up the earlier arguments, expands them in the light of a body of
<br>
fascinating material, and winds up being, if anything, still more of a tour de
<br>
force.
<br>
<p>You get a feeling for what's to come from the book's first page, a diagram of
<br>
a human brain positioned above a map of Hamburg. The two shapes are strikingly
<br>
similar, which, as Johnson sets out to show, is no accident. Nature and
<br>
society overflow with correspondences. To see, from Johnson's viewpoint, how
<br>
such correspondences come about and how we have learned to recognize and,
<br>
lately, make use of them entails a survey of ant life; Roman settlements;
<br>
subways; Manchester England; the early work of Friedrich Engels; the career of
<br>
Alan Turing; ants again; cybernetics; and video games--with a stop in there
<br>
for how the &quot;shrieking of the demons&quot; in John Milton's Paradise Lost spurred
<br>
one complexity theorist on to a major insight.
<br>
<p>Johnson defines emergence as &quot;the movement from low-level rules to high-level
<br>
sophistication.&quot; Emergent systems are &quot;not top-down. They get their smarts
<br>
from below.&quot; Like the emergent systems it describes, the book starts simply,
<br>
with a discussion of the one-celled creatures known as Dictyostelium
<br>
discoideum, or slime mold. Johnson doesn't just begin with slime mold; he
<br>
comes back to it again and again. If the book could be said to have a main
<br>
character, slime mold would have to be it. To grasp the workings of
<br>
Dictyostelium discoideum is, as Johnson takes no small delight in affirming,
<br>
to effect a revolution in thinking. It is to finally correct the mental error
<br>
that has for so long kept us from understanding why birds flock and liver
<br>
cells don't turn into spleen cells. Johnson calls that error the &quot;pacemaker
<br>
hypothesis.&quot; The hypothesis assumes that complex behavior depends on some form
<br>
of centralized authority. In the case of ants, it would be that the colony is
<br>
governed by the queen. In the case of slime mold, it would be that the
<br>
decision to cohere as a swarm is triggered by the dictates of alpha slime
<br>
cells.
<br>
<p>Both assumptions couldn't be further from the truth. The ant queen is kept
<br>
literally in the dark, way underground, far from the decisions about foraging
<br>
and fighting in which she plays no part. Similarly with slime cells: Their
<br>
trademark behavior does consist of assembling into a swarm that crawls &quot;across
<br>
the garden floor, consuming rotting leaves and wood as it moves about,&quot; only
<br>
to disintegrate back into individual units when conditions change. Slime mold
<br>
manages this trick--what complexity theorists call a &quot;phase change&quot;--without
<br>
benefit of a higher authority. &quot;All slime mold cells,&quot; as researchers were
<br>
puzzled to discover, &quot;are created equal.&quot; They also equally obey certain
<br>
rules. And they monitor one another's behavior constantly. Therefore, when the
<br>
weather gets cool and food becomes abundant, each cell notices that the one
<br>
and only slimy thing to do is to swarm suddenly. What it comes down to in the
<br>
molecular fine print is a chemical that the cells emit. The more a cell senses
<br>
that chemical, the more heartily it contributes to the chemical chorus. And
<br>
what sufficient quantities of that chemical say in terms no slime cell can
<br>
resist is: &quot;Swarm.&quot;
<br>
<p>Self-organizing behavior is no stranger to scientists today. But in 1969, when
<br>
Evelyn Fox Keller and Lee A. Segel put it forward as an explanation for slime
<br>
swarming, biologists were mystified. The idea of complexity resulting from
<br>
bottom-up interactions had been explored in urban planning by Jane Jacobs and
<br>
in mathematics by Alan Turing, among others. In fact, Turing's late musings
<br>
about how complex organisms could arise from simple cells jogged Keller into
<br>
conceiving the new slime paradigm. But for the most part, biologists remained
<br>
prejudiced in favor of cellular authority. For them, complex behavior was an
<br>
orchestra led by its conductor rather than, say, a string quartet whose
<br>
members listen to one another well. It was no small matter that biologists
<br>
were stuck on pacemakers; it meant they really didn't have a handle on how the
<br>
governing idea of their discipline--Darwinism--actually worked. In a sense, it
<br>
was as if they held back from admitting the full implication of natural
<br>
selection: namely, that it requires no outside agitators, no presiding
<br>
spirits, no--as the philosopher Daniel Dennett puts it--skyhooks. In fact,
<br>
evolution is the best possible illustration of what Johnson means when he
<br>
writes about &quot;complex adaptive systems that display emergent behavior.&quot;;
<br>
Evolution is the showcase example of simple things becoming more complex, dull
<br>
things becoming smarter under pressure to survive.
<br>
<p>It took a while, but biologists caught on. It didn't hurt that computer
<br>
scientists soon learned to model adaptive behavior on-screen. One of the more
<br>
amazing stories that Johnson tells concerns Danny Hillis's experiment with
<br>
genetic algorithms. Unlike traditional computer programs, which are static,
<br>
genetic algorithms change over time. The ones best suited to solving a given
<br>
problem are allowed to survive and, in effect, to reproduce; the others, in a
<br>
digital simulation of extinction, are deleted. Hillis's idea was to set some
<br>
undistinguished bits of software loose on the problem of sorting data. Sorting
<br>
data--in alphabetic order or by any other index--is a task that takes even
<br>
computers a lot of time when the data set is large enough. Not surprisingly,
<br>
computer scientists have devoted considerable energy to devising the most
<br>
efficient sort, the one that can get the job done with the fewest computer
<br>
instructions. In the Hillis experiment, programs that managed the job best
<br>
passed their code on to a next generation, after being subjected to a bit of
<br>
random mutation (à la cosmic rays) and code-swapping (à la sex) with other
<br>
promising miniprograms. Hillis, a founder of Thinking Machines Corporation,
<br>
had the company's supercomputers at his disposal and was able to churn through
<br>
thousands of evolutionary cycles in mere seconds.
<br>
<p>Hillis found that the most efficient routine achieved a 72-step sort, as
<br>
compared with the 60 steps required by the fastest human-coded algorithms. Not
<br>
satisfied with this gap, however, he introduced predators into the simulation.
<br>
Predators didn't allow programs to rest on 72-step laurels; they forced the
<br>
sorting routines to risk getting slower on the chance of getting faster. (As
<br>
the poet Rainer Maria Rilke has observed, &quot;abiding is nowhere.&quot;) With
<br>
predators at their heels, some routines drove on to a 62-step sort. The
<br>
astonishing thing about those 62-steps was that Danny Hillis couldn't make
<br>
heads or tails of them. Hillis had figured out how to link up 64,000 cheap
<br>
microprocessors so that running in parallel they were competitive with the
<br>
best supercomputers Cray or Fujitsu had to offer. But how a mere 62 lines of
<br>
code whose function was already known did their job remained mysterious to
<br>
him. The simulation seemed to have goosed into being an utterly alien approach
<br>
to problem solving.
<br>
<p>So much for the old adage that a program can do only what its programmers tell
<br>
it to do. From here on, in Johnson's view, programs that are so constrained
<br>
will be considered the dullards of software. The really interesting problems
<br>
will be treated to genetic algorithms. Programmers will adopt the Hillis
<br>
method: &quot;Mix, mutate, evaluate, repeat.&quot; And be amazed. This is how, for
<br>
example, in 1999 the computer scientist Marco Dorigo approached the
<br>
notoriously difficult &quot;traveling salesmen&quot; problem. What is the shortest route
<br>
between n stops that goes through each of them once and once only? When n gets
<br>
large enough, as happens on telephone and computer networks, there's no
<br>
surefire answer, only educated guesswork. Dorigo found that genetic algorithms
<br>
guess better than humans can. Johnson reports that France Telecom, British
<br>
Telecommunications, and MCI now let emergent software solve their routing
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>Johnson calls such applications examples of artificial emergence and thinks
<br>
that we are on the threshold of an age that will be defined by them. We now
<br>
not only understand the ways of slime mold, we can simulate them; and beyond
<br>
that, we can harvest the results. In Johnson's view, the influence of
<br>
artificial emergence is or soon will be making itself felt not only on
<br>
software but in politics, mass media, corporate structure, and the shape of
<br>
the movement against globalization. In phrases calculated to set off echoes,
<br>
he writes: &quot;Up to now, the philosophers of emergence have struggled to
<br>
interpret the world. But they are now starting to change it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Johnson's account of the prehistory of emergence--how it itself has emerged
<br>
from urban planning, entomology, information theory, cell biology,
<br>
neuroscience, and other disciplines to became a discipline of its own--is a
<br>
masterful piece of storytelling, but only a sort of warm-up for him.
<br>
Artificial emergence is his real terrain. Feed's experiments with interface
<br>
design and online community gave him experience not only in studying but in
<br>
shaping it. The author's experience as a maker of the phenomena he describes
<br>
distinguishes Emergence from a book like James Gleick's Chaos: Making a New
<br>
Science, to which it in other respects bears comparison.
<br>
<p>Johnson's discussion of artificial emergence elaborates on points he made in
<br>
Interface Culture. There he had claimed great things for the computer
<br>
interface: It was about to became the platform for a twentieth-first century
<br>
avant-garde that would filter and interpret reality for us as novelists did
<br>
for the nineteenth century. The &quot;Victorians,&quot; he wrote, &quot;had writers like
<br>
Dickens to ease them through the technological revolutions of the industrial
<br>
age.&quot; The computer interface would similarly guide us through &quot;the virtual
<br>
cities of the twenty-first century.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the years since Interface Culture, I, for one, have wondered if this
<br>
prediction was another of those flights of optimistic fancy, like the notion
<br>
that the Dow Jones average would plateau at 36,000, that had best be forgotten
<br>
in the light of new realities. After all, despite hits from the Justice
<br>
Department, Microsoft Windows still straddles the desktop like an ancien
<br>
régime. No sign of emergence there: Microsoft is one of the places the
<br>
pacemaker hypothesis holds true. And not even the most fervent supporters of
<br>
the open-source alternative to Windows would count the computer interface as
<br>
among it strengths. Where, then, is the Johnsonian avant-garde?
<br>
<p>As Emergence makes abundantly obvious, it is flourishing in the world of
<br>
games, such as SimCity and its sequel The Sims, and in the articulation of
<br>
online communities, such as Slashdot. Lest video games be derided as
<br>
inconsequential as compared to Windows and the novel, Johnson stresses the
<br>
opposite view: Video games are poised to replace pornography itself as the
<br>
leading engine of technological development. &quot;Because part of their appeal
<br>
lies in their promise of new experiences,&quot; he writes, &quot;and because their
<br>
audience is willing to scale formidable learning curves in pursuit of those
<br>
new experiences, games often showcase cutting-edge technology before the tech
<br>
makes its way over to the red-light district. Certainly that has been the case
<br>
with emergent software.&quot;
<br>
<p>In Emergence, Johnson has put some powerful ideas through a literary feedback
<br>
loop that will, in all likelihood, accelerate and magnify their effect on our
<br>
culture. Does he occasionally display some of the tics and tremors that come
<br>
with believing you are hot on the trail of a theory of everything? Absolutely.
<br>
He thinks emergent software, and not, say, more public transportation, is the
<br>
solution to traffic jams. &quot;Make the traffic lights smart,&quot; he writes. &quot;You can
<br>
conquer gridlock by making the grid itself smart.&quot; This is not the
<br>
technorealism Johnson was once known for espousing as a middle road between
<br>
technophiles and technophobes. Nor is it necessarily technorealistic to
<br>
imagine that Bach-like music composed by emergent code will lack for nothing
<br>
to seem to us as &quot;sweet&quot; as Bach's own works. But these aberrations or, in the
<br>
second case, serious complications, which call for more reflection, in no way
<br>
compromise the value of the book.
<br>
<p>Interface Culture gave me food for thought for years. I expect the same from
<br>
Emergence. I keep coming back to that sorting routine Danny Hillis couldn't
<br>
parse. That was only 62 lines of code. What 10-million-line piece of emergent
<br>
intelligence now slouches toward a compiler to be born? Will it be a rough
<br>
beast at least vaguely familiar to us? In other words, will it illuminate an
<br>
aspect of intelligence latent in the human brain? Or will it prove to be as
<br>
alien and inscrutable as a Hillis sort?
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
