<p>Here's one I just made up: &quot;Some acorns are afraid to become trees&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I know it's not comforting.
<br>
<p>How about &quot;you must _be willing to_ give up everything you are for what you might become&quot;?
<br>
Doesn't mean you have to, just means you have to be willing. Sounds congruent with 
<br>
pancritical rationalism from where I'm standing.
<br>
<p>Just as annoying, I'm sure, but I think it's a tad closer to the mark Mr. Bradbury was aiming at.
<br>
You can twist any saying into a cult rubric. *Yawn*.
<br>
<p>Annoyingly yours,
<br>
