<p><em>&gt;The Taliban emerged around 1993, well after the Soviet withdrawal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- so you are literally correct. But I think it is perhaps a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disingenuous to imply that the USA had nothing  to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Taliban. The CIA channeled large amounts of funding and arms via
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ISI to support militant Islamic groups in opposing the Soviet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invasion. Individuals supported (indirectly) by the USA at that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time included Usama bin Laden. From the wreckage at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;end of the Soviet withdrawal emerged the Taliban, utilising
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weaponry and training that had previously been provided by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ISI/CIA.
</em><br>
<p>The Taliban are actually a student movement that started in the
<br>
Maddrassas of Pakistan who later allied with Ossama &quot;the weasel&quot;
<br>
bin laden. The U.S. did not directly support them, nor was it our
<br>
intention to support such a group.
<br>
<p>Our efforts did have unfortunate unintended consequences. This is
<br>
a different thing from causation and therefore direct
<br>
responsibility.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The ultimate consequences of this (9/11) is clearly wholly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unanticipated, and in that sense no 'blame' can be attributed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US foreign policy in the late 80s/early 90s. Terrorists, harboured
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by the Taliban, were responsible for 9/11; not the USA.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;However, this unfortunate sequence of events should certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alert everyone to the fact that foreign policy that at the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might seem sensible (fight the Soviet invasion') can have wholly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unanticipated (and fatal) consequences for US citizens and Afghani
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilians caught in the crossfire.
</em><br>
<p><p>Indeed, something to take into consideration in the future. But I
<br>
have no intention of letting rival tribes in Afghanistan who's
<br>
bickering was the actual cause of the bloodshed try to pass it off
<br>
on the U.S.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I agree there is no direct chain of causality here; the US is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'responsible' in that sense. But in its foreign policy, the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shapes attitudes and events that have consequences. One of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goals of foreign policy (or covert operations?) must surely be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limit as much as possible any unintended consequences. So in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense at least, US foreign policy of the late 80s might be said to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have failed.
</em><br>
<p>In some sense maybe, but there were many good consequences as well.
<br>
<p>Communism has been vanquished, and I think the world is in better
<br>
shape now than ever.
<br>
<p>Not that there isn't room for improvement.
<br>
<p>I certainly see many hopefull signs, from things like the USMC's
<br>
warrior/knight concept....
