</em><br>
<p>See what we did in Nicaragua and Chile.  See the hundreds of
<br>
thousands dying and dead in Iraq from our actions during and
<br>
sense Desert Storm.  See spreading cluster bombs all over parts
<br>
of Southeast Asia we were officially not at war with and claimed
<br>
we were not involved in.  See the bloody thugs we supported for
<br>
decades in Haiti who killed more hundreds of thousands.  See
<br>
bombin whoever we feel like whenever we feel threatened
<br>
regardless of international niceties.  In terms of lives lost,
<br>
dreams destroyed, unilateral nastiness I don't think we come out
<br>
so obviously good in comparison as we would like to believe.  I
<br>
wish I thought otherwise but I honestly do not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Evil exists.  Some people, nations, and cultures are evil and wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and dangerous.  Denial of this simple fact won't make it go away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A couple of well-placed nukes 50 years ago did make some of it go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away for a long time, and Mike is just pointing that out.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular method won't work in Afghanistan or against Al-Qaeda, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let's hope we can find a method that does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I see.  And when branded &quot;evil&quot;, rightly or wrongly, by a
<br>
sufficiently powerful group, everything goes and everything is
<br>
justified heh?  What a wonderful world.  A short glance back in
<br>
history will show many groups and nations being branded as evil
<br>
and decimated by strong opponents.  Some of them history
<br>
exonerates.  Others are the worst monsters on record.  Just
<br>
perhaps, branding someone or some nation as utterly evil, is not
<br>
the sanest and best way to proceed.  When the &quot;other&quot; is &quot;evil&quot;
<br>
the temptation is to believe that one's own group must be the
<br>
&quot;good&quot; and that any who point out where that just isn't so are
<br>
themselves &quot;evil&quot;.   Both sides are dehumanized by this
<br>
process.  Truth is the first casualty of war.
