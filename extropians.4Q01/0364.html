</em><br>
<p>This is why the discovery is interesting, actually, and why Chomsky, whose
<br>
opinion on biology is only slightly better than his opinion on politics,
<br>
should welcome it.  The gene in question, I believe, is involved with
<br>
regulating the transcription of a variety of other genes during development.
<br>
This means that a relatively small change in this gene could cause a cascade
<br>
of effects throughout development.  The summation of these effects could
<br>
allow a brain area developed 'for' another 'purpose' to be involved in the
<br>
production of language.  The spirit, if not the letter of chomsky's
<br>
hypothesis.  I imagine his reasons for not supporting the evolution of brain
<br>
structures specifically for language comes from the preposterousness of that
<br>
level of complexity arising in the brain on its own.  This new finding,
<br>
which shows how a small change can co-opt brain structures for a new
<br>
purpose, is a plausible explanation for the evolution of language.
<br>
<p>I can say more once I have read the whole article, if anyone is interested.
<br>
I am especially interested in S. Pinker's take on the discovery, included in
<br>
the same issue, but my *&amp;@# school does not have an online subscription to
<br>
Nature.  That means I am forced to leave my computer to find the article.
<br>
Sigh
