UCLA TEAM DEVELOPS MOLECULAR SWITCHES,
<br>
A STEP TOWARD POWERFUL MOLECULAR COMPUTERS
<br>
<a href="http://www.smalltimes.com/document_display.cfm?document_id=2444">http://www.smalltimes.com/document_display.cfm?document_id=2444</a>
<br>
A team of researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, has moved
<br>
an important step closer to building a computer from the bottom up: They have
<br>
attached molecular switches on a grid as small as 50 nanometers.
<br>
<p>The breakthrough is new ground in molecular memory and logic, said James
<br>
Heath, UCLA chemistry and biochemistry professor as well as co-scientific
<br>
director of the California NanoSystems Institute. The team has developed
<br>
a 16-bit memory circuit that uses molecular switches that &quot;work pretty well&quot;
<br>
on traditional wiring, Heath said. The process uses chemical assembly and
<br>
fluidics to mount the switches on a crossbar-type structure.
<br>
<p>The research has yet to be published, but Heath gave a glimpse of the next
<br>
step toward molecular computers this week at UCLA. His presentation was part
<br>
of a statewide series of events to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the
<br>
Nobel Prizes. The audience included Nobel laureates and Crown Princess
<br>
Victoria of Sweden.
<br>
<p>One of the reasons California is widely touting the Nobel Prize Centennial is
<br>
that the state has the largest concentration of Nobel laureates anywhere in
<br>
the world. Of the 700 recipients of the Nobel Prize, more than 100 have been
<br>
Californians. Since World War II, California has averaged two Nobel Prize
<br>
winners per year.
<br>
<p>While honoring past contributions to science, the event focused on showing the
<br>
best of present research at UCLA and the University of California, Santa
<br>
Barbara. That included Heath's discoveries on the path to ultimately building
<br>
an energy-efficient computer made of nanowires and organic molecules.
<br>
<p>&quot;The goal is to reach a realistic limit to create a computer that requires
<br>
very little energy to operate,&quot; Heath said. &quot;It's a problem of trying to make
<br>
this very efficient computing machine.&quot; Circuitry is one of the next steps.
<br>
<p>&quot;Learning how to use that circuit is really learning how to grab that
<br>
molecular signature at a specific junction. That's a big challenge,&quot; Heath
<br>
said. &quot;If you look at the nanoliterature, you'll find a lot of device stuff,
<br>
but you very rarely will find anything on circuits, because they are just that
<br>
much harder.&quot;
<br>
<p>By devices, Heath meant molecular switches, which are now working well enough
<br>
in his lab to go to the next step -- to place and connect the molecular
<br>
switches on a lithographic grid. The molecular switches change their
<br>
conductivity as electricity passes through.
<br>
<p>Heath's team already has demonstrated a reconfigurable molecular switch that
<br>
works in a solid state at room temperature -- a breakthrough that solves one
<br>
of the obstacles toward the creation of molecular computers.
<br>
<p>Work on the switches, now in their fifth generation, was in conjunction with
<br>
UCLA chemist J. Fraiser Stoddart. Stoddart came to UCLA a few years ago from
<br>
England's University of Birmingham.
<br>
<p>&quot;There's a long way to go,&quot; Heath said. &quot;Right now we have circuits with
<br>
molecules on a grid on normal lithographic wires.&quot; The goal is that one day
<br>
the grid would be assembled with carbon nanotubes.
<br>
<p>Describing the computer architecture as a road map, Heath said the system was
<br>
at the neighborhood level. &quot;We are getting the logic and memory circuitry at
<br>
the link scales that are molecular or scalable to molecular. That's where we
<br>
are,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't have them talking to each other yet.&quot;
<br>
<p>For now, the switches are put together as a single molecular layer on top of
<br>
the wires and line up through chemical assembly. &quot;The wires are done more or
<br>
less using traditional approaches all at room temperature,&quot; Heath said.
<br>
<p>Specifically, Heath's team is working on building a Boolean logic,
<br>
non-reversible computing machine from the bottom up. &quot;It's complicated enough
<br>
that if you do it, you are going to learn something,&quot; Heath said.
<br>
<p>&quot;One of the challenges but one of the real hopes is that you can somehow take
<br>
advantage of this wonderful beauty at the molecular scale and be able to
<br>
utilize that for things like information technology,&quot; Heath said. &quot;The real
<br>
difficult problem we went after was not just to try to make a computer, but to
<br>
try to make a computer that operated at what we think is the appropriate
<br>
method for computation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Heath is &quot;making large progress on small problems,&quot; said Paul Boyer, a 1997
<br>
Nobel Prize-winning chemist at UCLA. &quot;Jim and I share, in one sense, a study
<br>
in nanosystems,&quot; Boyer said. &quot;In my instance, I was lucky to work with a
<br>
particular enzyme -- a biologic nanosystem that turned out to be a little
<br>
molecular motor that worked in cells to make some of the compounds we need for
<br>
life. Now Jim, instead of looking at something that's already there, is trying
<br>
to assemble these nanocircuits from the bottom up.&quot;
<br>
<p>It was another California Nobel Prize winner, the late quantum physicist
<br>
Richard Feynman, who predicted the age of nanotechnology when he gave his
<br>
now-famous 1959 lecture at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. His
<br>
talk, &quot;There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom,&quot; outlined the theoretical concept
<br>
of manipulating individual atoms to build molecules.
<br>
<p>In his presentation before the Nobel laureates, Heath acknowledged Feynman's
<br>
legacy. How to run a molecular computer using a very small amount of energy is
<br>
one of the problems Feynman thought about in the years before he died in 1988,
<br>
Heath said. &quot;The ones and zeroes are going to cost you energy to switch them
<br>
back and forth,&quot; he said.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
