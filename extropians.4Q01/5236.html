It's seems only reasonable to elevate Spike Jones to ExI's Chief Humor Officer. What do y'all think?
<br>
<p>Besides, the title itself sounds paradoxical -- maybe turn a few heads.
<br>
<p>Or am I am just talking out of post-Newtonmass inebriation and elation?
<br>
<p>What would a Chief Humor Officer do, I hear you ask? Don't know. Court jester who keeps people honest? Gathers and creates uniquely transhumanist 
<br>
humor?
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I second this great idea!!  And I would want to be his lackey(I mean assistant!), except that I still have not formally joined ExI.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
