<em>&gt; &gt;Do the US already effectively communicate their views to the people, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their own language ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the latest Economist, it started just this last week. Before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this last week, the US administration's broadcast presented in English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lame messages (&quot;Attention Taliban. You are condemned. Did you know that?&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now diplomats are responding directly on the local al-Jazeera network,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving interviews in Arabic.
</em><br>
<p><p>Thanks for the info. That's certainly good (I couldn't find the
<br>
translated transcripts of the interviews with Google though). I still
<br>
think that something that lasts could be useful. Words said on TV are
<br>
readily wiped out by persuasion from people present in your physical
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>And answering (hostile) questions is not the same as freely choosing
<br>
to introduce yourself in some way. Something that all could refer to,
<br>
and discuss ; and that Americans would somehow endorse, too (compare
<br>
with talks of diplomats we don't even know about). Something a bit
<br>
deeper, broader...
<br>
<p>I heard some Afghanis were actually convinced by the Talibans that the
<br>
food dropped by US airplanes was poisonned, and starved to death
<br>
instead of eating it...
