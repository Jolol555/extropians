<p>I'm not discussing the posthuman world here, but the world of tomorrow.
<br>
While people do worry about scenarios where superintelligent grey goo
<br>
from the stars eats humanity, the most powerful impact is with the idea
<br>
that within a few years you *must* get yourself a better brain in order
<br>
to avoid becoming poor and powerless. That slots neatly into a lot of
<br>
political pre-programming and gives us a ready-made organized political
<br>
resistance to our projects. To worsen things, most people are used to
<br>
ideologies that prescribe the same behavior for all humans, and do not
<br>
accept the idea that other humans may have other goals. 
<br>
<p>We need to handle this, both by showing how our ambitions are not
<br>
compulsory, but also by a careful economic and social analysis of the
<br>
impact of enhancing technologies in society. Easier said than done.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><em>&gt;From the beginning of Tom Purdom's &quot;Fossil Games&quot; (a rather good story,
</em><br>
IMHO):
<br>
<p>Morgan.s mother and father had given him a state-of-the-art inheritance.
<br>
It was only state-of-the-art-2117 but they had seen where the world was
<br>
going. They had mortgaged 20 percent of their future income so they
<br>
could order a package that included all the genetic enhancements
<br>
Morgan.s chromosomes could absorb, along with two full decades of
<br>
postnatal development programs. Morgan was in his fifties when his
<br>
father committed suicide. By that time his father could barely
<br>
communicate with half the people he encountered in his day to day
<br>
business activities.
<br>
<p>Morgan.s mother survived by working as a low-level freelance prostitute.
<br>
The medical technology that was state-of-the-art-2157 could eliminate
<br>
all the relevant physical effects of aging and a hidden computer link
<br>
could guide her responses. For half an hour.as long as no one demanded
<br>
anything too unusual.she could give her younger customers the illusion
<br>
they were interacting with someone who was their intellectual and
<br>
psychological equal. Morgan tried to help her, but there wasn.t much he
<br>
could do. He had already decided he couldn.t survive in a solar system
<br>
in which half the human population had been born with brains, glands,
<br>
and nervous systems that were state-of-the-art-2150 and later. He had
<br>
blocked his mother.s situation out of his memory and lived at
<br>
subsistence level for almost three decades. Every yen, franc, and yuri
<br>
he could scrape together had been shoved into the safest investments his
<br>
management program could locate. Then he had taken all his hard-won
<br>
capital and bought two hundred shares in an asteroid habitat a group of
<br>
developers had outfitted with fusion reactors, plasma drives, solar
<br>
sails, and anything else that might make a small island move at 9
<br>
percent the speed of light. And he and three thousand other
<br>
&quot;uncompetitive,&quot; &quot;under-enhanced&quot; humans had crept away from the solar
<br>
system. And set off to explore the galaxy.
