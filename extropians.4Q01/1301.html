<em>&gt; &gt; It's a big deal if banks, mortgage companies,etc. inside and outside

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, that would be necessary for real capitalism to emerge.
</em><br>
<p>That's the key requirement, since a person's home is generally either
<br>
the only or the largest capital asset they ever acquire in their lives.
<br>
Preventing them from being able to leverage that capital is a great
<br>
damper on any effort to create a true market economy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Owning your own home means absolutely nothing, asset-wise, if noone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; around you accepts/recognizes it as your property. (That's one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; big problems, as I understand it, about why these people, who do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indeed own their own property, cannot turn it into something of value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to their economic lives.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If these people can't own their own property, then they're not really living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a capitalist system, and therefore the sub-title of the book (&quot;Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else&quot;) is erroneous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since capitalism is not actually in practice in these regions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bottom line: this book sounds like a real stinker.
</em><br>
<p>Its part of the non-trust mindset. For example, in some former communist
<br>
countries, housing became privatized, but home/apartment dwellers who
<br>
now 'own' their own homes are statutorily prevented from being able to
<br>
sell their own property (except to state agencies) because the state
<br>
doesn't trust them to be intelligent enough to deal well on the open
<br>
market (and doesn't trust that most people won't be pressured into
<br>
selling for lowball offers to mafioso). Of course, these people wouldn't
<br>
be intimidated by mafioso if they also had the right to keep and bear
<br>
arms, but thats a whole other story (as far as some people here are
<br>
concerned).
