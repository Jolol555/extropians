</em><br>
<p>Yes however there are still substantial problems.  In theory
<br>
we should be able to find a way to round out the orbit, but
<br>
I haven't seen anything really convincing.  Mike Lorrey pointed
<br>
out that it is possible to harden electronics to 1400G.  We
<br>
still need to carry some fuel and some means of keeping the
<br>
orbitter pointy end first while we burn that orbit adjust
<br>
fuel, which would need to be a substantial fraction of the payload,
<br>
depending on the angle we left the atmosphere.  Let me get
<br>
off my lazy ass and spin up a spreadsheet of necessary
<br>
fuel wt vs angle of exit from atmosphere.  I did this once
<br>
about 10 yrs ago and was disappointed by how much
<br>
fuel was still needed and how low an angle outbound
<br>
was needed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would seem to me that for any payload capable of
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Nuclear fuel would be good perhaps, since it is so
<br>
dense.  Water might be a bit problematic since its
<br>
density is low enough that the payload ballistic
<br>
coefficient of the shell goes down.
<br>
<p>I was once interested in a rail launch where a
<br>
human is sent up, submerged in water.  I got
<br>
into this after putting a number of minnows in
<br>
a centrifuge at 100 G for 10 minutes.  They all
<br>
survived.  {8^D
<br>
<p>My design for a rail launched
<br>
human capsule didn't work out with a reasonable
<br>
rail length, unless you can go up the side of one of
<br>
the worlds tallest mountains.  This can be problematic,
<br>
for as soon as you propose it, some silly prole will
<br>
argue that mountains are sacred, yakkity yak and
<br>
bla bla.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the economic advantages of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun launch present a striking commercial opportunity.
</em><br>
<p>Roger that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...would seem a promising means to that end.
</em><br>
<p>Roger that too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I have to ask, &quot;Where's the problem?. Why hasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone done this?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Its hard.  Even after ya know how to do it.  {8-]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also,  sometime back I read that the PV solar panels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the Internation Space Station generate 65 kw and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost $500,000,000.
</em><br>
<p>Ja, those things are pricey.  They are specialty PV
<br>
panels, able to withstand launch environment, orbit
<br>
environment and still demonstrate 3 nines reliability
<br>
after 5 yrs in orbit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; parabolic dish made of minimum thickness  styrofoam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and coated with a film of appropriate reflective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material.
</em><br>
<p>Styrofoam wont hold up in earth orbit for even a few
<br>
days.  Atomic oxygen and UV will eat it up.  But I
<br>
hear what you are suggesting.  The convincing studies
<br>
to date have been on mylar balloons which are metallized
<br>
by vaporized aluminum on orbit.  Then the reflective surface
<br>
holds up after the mylar surface is oxydized away.  Ill see if
<br>
I can find URLs that refer to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For comparison purposes, at 10% conversion efficiency,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 1300 watts/sq meter, you can get 65 kw out of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dish a mere 13m in radius.  (And a dish of 100m radius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delivers a healthy 4 mega watts.)
</em><br>
<p>The problem with the biggie dish is the conversion at the
<br>
focal point.  Since we are materials limited to max temperatures
<br>
below about 4000K, there might not be any big advantages
<br>
to making one huge reflector.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Two immediate obsevations.  Weightlessness would seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to allow an EXTREMELY large dish,
</em><br>
<p>Right, it does.  So how do we convert the energy once we
<br>
concentrate that much of it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the hard vacuum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of space seems to suggest that the reflective surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be subject to oxidative degradation.
</em><br>
<p>Only if we get waaaay up there.  Unfortunately the
<br>
leo environment has atomic oxygen, highly reactive
<br>
and at high speed relative to your orbitter.  Its pressure
<br>
is very low, of course, but there are still jillions of
<br>
collisions per square cm per second, and materials
<br>
break down after a while.  If we can lift the stuff
<br>
a couple thousand km, this problem goes away,
<br>
and then we merely need to contend with radiation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I envision the dish as spin stabilized to keep it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointed at the sun,
</em><br>
<p>Sure but you still need to adjust the axis of rotation
<br>
a degree a day to account for its orbit about the
<br>
sun.  {Assuming you have it orbitting in the earth's
<br>
neighborhood.}  So spin stabilization doesnt solve
<br>
everything.  But a degree a day isn't that hard to do,
<br>
and the propellant required is estimated thus:  it takes
<br>
as much angular momentum to change a rotating body
<br>
pi/2 as it had to start with, so you need to turn 2 pi per
<br>
year, so estimate the moment of inertia of the dish and
<br>
the necessary rotation rate, multiply to get the angular
<br>
momentum and you need 4 times that much per year.
<br>
<p>Perhaps that argues against getting *too* carried away
<br>
with the size of the dish, since moment of inertia increases
<br>
as the 4th power of the diameter of a disk in general.
<br>
<p>More later on that, gotta go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe I'm just talking out my asteroid, but hey, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; havin' fun.
</em><br>
<p>Me too.  Speaking of which, shall we start a Lorrey-esque
<br>
subgroup to discuss this, or will the extropians indulge us
<br>
by allowing us to post orbit-gun and inflatable dish stuff
<br>
on the main list?  spike
