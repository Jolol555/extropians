<em>&gt; Citizens and foreign nationals pulled in in an open sweep on no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounds or very weak grounds or their nationality or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethnicity or their religion or age and gender or some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combination ... are &quot;prisoners of war&quot;?  Excuse me?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What are you calling a &quot;open sweep&quot;?  I have only heard of one or two people
<br>
picked up in any given location.
<br>
<p>The officials deny pulling anyone in based on ethnicity or religion.  They
<br>
say they only picked up people who has a specific connection to the
<br>
terrorists.
<br>
<p>As for &quot;age&quot; and &quot;gender&quot;... I haven't even heard of private citizens
<br>
running around discriminating on the basis of &quot;age&quot; or &quot;gender&quot;.  The
<br>
inclusion of these in the list makes your complaint look like paranoia,
<br>
rather than a response to what is actually happening.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The majority of these people are not even accused of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge but are brought in just in case they do or in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the government to look like it is doing something, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is wrong, morally questionable and very dangerous to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and civil rights.  It is up to us to take note and to question.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, people were picked up and questioned if it was thought that they knew
<br>
something, but about a week ago, Attourny General (Ashcroft) said that the
<br>
only people still in custody are those who have broken the law.  Some of
<br>
them are &quot;only&quot; breaking immigration laws, but everyone except criminals
<br>
have been released.
