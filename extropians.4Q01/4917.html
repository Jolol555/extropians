</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also very much
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of landminds and other unexploded ordinance in Afghanistan.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US has consistently refused to sign landmine treaties and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produces much of the landmines in the world.  Laos and Cambodia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also to this day suffering from landmines and various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unexploded ordinance from the Vietnam war.  The US still refuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to share much of its data about how specific devices from that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; era work with those attempting to find and defuse the landmines.
</em><br>
<p><p>As the closest thing to an expert on landmine warfare on this list (in all
<br>
likelihood at least), the above paragraph is so full of invalid assumptions
<br>
that it can effectively be discarded.  Very few people who have opinions on
<br>
this topic know anything about the doctrine, technology, and deployment of
<br>
landmines in warfare.  To try to paint the US as a bad guy on the topic of
<br>
landmines suggests great ignorance of some fundamental history and facts on
<br>
this subject.
<br>
<p>First of all, landmines have very legitimate and essentially irreplaceable
<br>
uses in conventional land warfare.  Furthermore, they are almost purely
<br>
defensive weapons.  Almost all the arguments against landmine warfare do not
<br>
apply to the US military, though most people assume this is the case.  The
<br>
primary purpose of landmines is to impede an offensive action, giving time
<br>
to the defenders to launch a defense and/or counterassault.  This is
<br>
particularly useful when the defenders expect to be badly outnumbered.
<br>
Because the US military has a history of setting up holding positions
<br>
against a numerically superior force, landmines have been an essential tool
<br>
for preventing a blitzkrieg style overrunning of our positions in those
<br>
environs.  In regions where the US forces do not face a credible threat of
<br>
overwhelming numbers, landmines are not deployed.  The reason so many
<br>
countries have no problem banning landmines is that most countries do not
<br>
have troops currently in positions where landmines could legitimately be
<br>
used.  The US *does* have troops in places where landmines are an essential
<br>
part of the defensive strategy and therefore have no interest in increasing
<br>
the vulnerability of their soldiers.  The wholesale banning of landmines is
<br>
not in the interest of the US and arguably not in the interest of others
<br>
insofar as it applies to the US.
<br>
<p>Second, unlike a great many third-world and other militaries, the US
<br>
military documents, with great detail and precision (in triplicate), the
<br>
location of every single mine it places.  For every mine laid in the field,
<br>
there is a massive paper trail.  Every minefield is precisely mapped and
<br>
archived for posterity.  Many (if not most) militaries in the world do not
<br>
do this, and many of the problems of undocumented minefields and random
<br>
landmines are a direct result of this.  The US military has people whose job
<br>
is to clear the minefields that the US has laid, one of the many reasons
<br>
they spend so much time on minefield documentation.  Absent an ongoing
<br>
conflict, the locations of US laid minefields is not considered a secret and
<br>
the US will typically make great efforts to recover the mines it has laid.
<br>
Obviously, the US cannot be reasonably held responsible for mines that it
<br>
has not laid, though I've seen many people attempt to do this.
<br>
<p>Third, don't confuse the primitive first generation mine technology that is
<br>
frequently deployed in the third world with state-of-the-art third
<br>
generation technology that the US typically deploys.  US military mines,
<br>
depending on their deployment method and mission, typically contain active
<br>
electronics that can 1) use a range of sensors to accurately identify
<br>
probable military targets as a condition of detonation, and 2) are designed
<br>
to become inert under a wide range of conditions, both explicitly triggered
<br>
and automatic (such as the basic timeout where a mine becomes inert a
<br>
certain amount of time after it has been laid).  The US military has
<br>
expended an extraordinary amount of effort and expense to make their
<br>
landmines as &quot;friendly&quot; as possible.
<br>
<p>In conclusion, the vast majority of landmine problems in the world are a
<br>
result of the irresponsible use of first and second generation landmine
<br>
technologies, landmines which are still being produced in vast quantities by
<br>
the Chinese and to a lesser extent the Russians and some European countries.
<br>
To blame the US for problems caused by the irresponsible use by other
<br>
militaries and other regimes that are using landmines that are
<br>
technologically inferior with respect to civilian safety is disingenuous.
<br>
Your brush is *way* too broad.  The US has expended vast quantities of money
<br>
in an effort to make landmine warfare safe; to condemn them for the sins of
<br>
others is exactly like condemning a private citizen who has defended their
<br>
life with a firearm merely because thugs use firearms to commit crimes also.
<br>
As with all things, landmines are merely a tool and the character of their
<br>
usage reflects the character of the user.
