<em>&gt; This is the second time you have said that you don't care why these people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to kill you, but that at the end of the day they just want to kill you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that knowing why they are trying to kill you could be rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important since removing that reason might be much easier than stopping them from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing you otherwise.  
</em><br>
<p>That is a possible strategy, but one which limits individual freedom.
<br>
Whatever happened to the non-coersion principle? The threat of death for
<br>
behaving a certain way is certainly coercive, and therefore
<br>
anti-extropian. Given this, the proper extropian way to counter a threat
<br>
of death for extropic behavior is to reciprocate in kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Say, eg, they don't like you wearing shorts to dinner on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first saturday of each month, then wearing something else might not be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much trouble, or another eg, they might just want the US military out of Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabia, then that should be easier than killing all of them too.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, and once they knew you would cave in on that, they would then say,
<br>
&quot;You have to stop making movies and tv programs which are sinful and
<br>
blasphemous.&quot; Then when you cave in to that, they will say, &quot;You have to
<br>
stop making televisions and computers and satellites, for they are an
<br>
affront to Allah.&quot; If you cave in on that, they will then say, &quot;All of
<br>
your women have to leave schools and cannot work outside the home, and
<br>
they have to wear burkhas in public and must have chaperones
<br>
everywhere.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ah, so much for extropy, lets all just get it over with and become good
<br>
little submissive medeival muslim radicals. So sayeth Alejandro...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, as an aside, you say that they want every American dead, but i haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard anything like that from &quot;them&quot; (whoever they may be).  Could you give me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any pointers?
</em><br>
<p>Osama bin Laden's fatwa declared all Americans to be justified targets
<br>
of attack by believers, on the rationale that all Americans pay taxes to
<br>
the government which continues to station troops in Saudi Arabia in
<br>
defense of the kingdom.
