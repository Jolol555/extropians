<em>&gt; It's exciting to see a possible new paradigm being born for fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics.  Even the early work is leading to specific models for universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with particles and fields that have some resemblance to our own.  Needless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say the string theorists are miffed as up til now they have been the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only ones who could make such claims.  But string theory has been around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for quite a while now and has yet to produce our universe.  Maybe this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new approach, still in its infancy, will hit closer to the mark.

I enjoy watching physicists search for the final theory of everything as
<br>
much as the next dilettante. However, I think it is impossible for humans to
<br>
every know that we have discovered the final theory of everything. (Just to
<br>
be clear: I am not saying that we are incapable of discovering it, although
<br>
I think this is quite likely, but that we cannot know that we have
<br>
discovered it). The following example I think make this clear:
<br>
<p>&quot;Suppose, for example, that next week a young physicist named 'Newteinstein'
<br>
publishes a grand unified field theory in Nature. Newteinstein completes and
<br>
unifies particle physics and cosmology. On the basis of this theory the
<br>
special sciences are completed in the next six months. A hundred thousand
<br>
generations of human physicists and other scientist are unable to improve on
<br>
Newteinsteinism, and anthropic optimism gradually becomes the entrenched
<br>
belief. Even in this hypothetical distant future the logic of justification
<br>
is the same. Those that endorse anthropic optimism would still have to bet
<br>
that creatures with larger brains (or CPUs) would not be able to improve on
<br>
the conceptualization of Newteinstein.&quot; (The full argument is at
<br>
www.markalanwalker.com/natu.htm )
<br>
<p>We need a nonhuman perspective on our cognition and its subject matter
<br>
before we would be in a position to say that we know that what we believe to
<br>
be the final theory of everything is really a final theory of everything.
<br>
Otherwise we have no reason not to suppose that what we have discovered is
<br>
only  the best human attempt at discovering the final theory of everything.
<br>
The best means to access such a nonhuman perspective would be to attempt to
<br>
create posthumans. Given we believe, (1) our goal is not just to discover
<br>
the final theory of everything but to be knowledgeable about this matter,
<br>
and (2) the imminent nature of posthumans, and (3) the fact that posthumans
<br>
ought to have at least as much chance of discovering the final theory of
<br>
everything as the ugly apes; then this suggests that it might be best to
<br>
reassign human theoretical physicists to performing some of the menial tasks
<br>
around AI and genetic engineering labs so as to speed up the arrival of
<br>
posthumans. But of course, all roads lead to transhumanism.
