</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The way I see it eventually happening is that we will each wear our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer which constantly watches the electrical actions in our brains in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microscopic detail. These computers will be AIs in their own right and will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradually come to learn what parts of our brains correspond to what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts/emotions/perceptions/movements.
</em><br>
<p>Why full-fleged AIs?  &quot;Neural networks&quot; are named that for a reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They will quite literally read our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds. Unlike our wetware they will be able to transmit the mental info to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people's computers which will be able to map the data to their host
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain's topology and stimulate them directly in the corresponding regions.
</em><br>
<p>The hardware for the raw brainscan has been commercially available for
<br>
years.  The challenge is pure software: translating the brainscan to
<br>
meaning on one end, and translating meaning to brain stimulus on the
<br>
other.  The latter may be easier than the former, since our natural
<br>
ability to learn can give meaning to an initially random, but
<br>
patterned, series of stimuli.  (Of course, there's also the practical
<br>
matter of having the software run on a computer light enough, with
<br>
batteries for sufficient life, to carry around...but this seems similar
<br>
in nature to designing video games for 1980s-era personal computers,
<br>
with the same approaches to code optimization seeming likely to pay
<br>
off if the scales are similar.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even with this degree of communication things are not so cut and dried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though.  How does one computer communicate color info to someone who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color blind?
</em><br>
<p>Mostly the same way one transmits sight info to someone who is entirely
<br>
blind.  With color blindness, the problem is not in the brain but in
<br>
the eyes; the circuitry is still there, behind the defective layer.
<br>
Likewise, scientists have transmitted stimuli directly to the visual
<br>
neurons of a blind person, and the result (a crude matrix of white dots
<br>
against a black background), while far from perfect sight, is
<br>
definitely nonzero.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am sure there would be some data that would not be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be transferred properly because some people might have sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissimilar backgrounds that nothing quite matches up, however there may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some way of extrapolating such difficult experiences back to basic sensory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data. For instance if someone wants to communicate their love of custard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apples they could send the flavor of custard apple as basic taste data,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then adding emotional overtones in -- where they were the first time they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tasted it, how happy they were, and a lot of other subconscious emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baggage that goes with the experience.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, such approximations may be necessary.  What, exactly, gets
<br>
transmitted and how?  Just as speech is built up from various basic
<br>
sounds, and computers communicate using structured series of voltages
<br>
and optic excitation levels, this communications method will have to
<br>
have some basics of communication...though these basics can be a lot
<br>
closer to our internal representation of information, and thus be
<br>
better able to express what we wish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the most useful aspect would be teaching of concepts. These are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often the most tricky to get across to others via language. However with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that comes the risk that it also becomes wonderful indoctrination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinery. It would be very easy to impart pathological fears or hatred,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though presumably the AIs would have safeguards... people will not likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be too happy about exposing their most valuable organ to that kind of risk.
</em><br>
<p>I think the arts might get more immediate use out of it.  Take, for
<br>
example, any television program or movie you've seen recently, and
<br>
alter it in some way.  Say, put it in a different setting, or change
<br>
the dialog.  Now, what if, merely by imagining it (and maybe pushing a
<br>
few buttons), you could get a computer to record a digital image,
<br>
complete with sound, of your dream.  You can review it as many times as
<br>
you like, and if you think of some favorable alteration, just think it
<br>
and re-record.  To put it bluntly, the bottom would drop out of
<br>
production costs, especially if the machines to record could be
<br>
manufactured cheaply.  (Good and cheap software to edit video streams
<br>
already exists, though it typically does need high-end hardware to
<br>
process in real time; it could easily be adapted to accept a new video
<br>
input.)  Sturgeon's Law dictates that much of this would, of course, be
<br>
crap...but with greater quantity also comes more diamonds, and the top
<br>
works could be all that much better for their ease of creation.
<br>
<p>And once the arts gain experience using it to shape dreams, adapting
<br>
the software to control machines would be trivial.  After that comes
<br>
machines (say, nanite clouds) whose shape and utility are determined
<br>
and designed upon use.  (&quot;Do we make this portable bridge 4 meters or
<br>
6 meters long?&quot;  &quot;Oh, let's wait 'til we're at the river and just make
<br>
it however long we need it to be that day.&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it's a long way away... 50 years????
</em><br>
<p>I suspect it might be one of the enablers of the Singularity, if hard
<br>
AI can not be cracked before this tech becomes available.
