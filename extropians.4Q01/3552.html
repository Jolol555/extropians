<p>The notion of thwarting attempts to escape justice via suicide is new
<br>
to me.  What would you do if you restored a suicide bomber from a backup?
<br>
There wouldn't be much point in giving him the death penalty.  So what
<br>
is the idea, would you torture him?  That doesn't seem very enlightened.
<br>
<p>### This notion was explored by Stanislaw Lem in one of his short stories,
<br>
where a robotic philosopher, who formulated an ideology eerily similar to
<br>
communism and thereby contributed to horrible suffering, is being
<br>
resurrected using electronic methods by a group of reactionaries, tortured,
<br>
killed, and resurrected again. And the poor wight doesn't even know about
<br>
the effects his ideology had on the society after his (first) death.
<br>
<p>That short story persuaded me, about 20 years ago when I first read it, that
<br>
the idea of &quot;deserving of punishment&quot;, as some inherent quality of a person
<br>
and the results of vis activities, is wrong. Since then I came to see
<br>
punishment in a purely instrumental fashion, a way of deterring future
<br>
wrongness, not erasing past evil.
<br>
<p>Yet, resurrection of suicidal miscreants might be actually quite a good
<br>
deterrent, especially against those who, like me, espouse the &quot;state&quot;
<br>
concept of personal identity (as opposed to the &quot;continuation&quot; concept). I
<br>
don't know how it would work against theists.
