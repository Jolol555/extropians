</em><br>
<em>&gt; When making comments such as this one, keep in mind the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions behind it.  The reason inheritance taxes were cut is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that that weath had already been taxed.  An inheritance tax is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; double taxation.  The basic assumption under an inheritance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax is that wealth all really belongs to the government but it allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to use some of it.  My assumption is that all wealth belongs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the people but we let the government use some of it.  Under that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption, all inheritance tax makes no sense and should be illegal.
</em><br>
<p>The other false assumption is that far more ultra-rich people benefit
<br>
than middle class people. A farmer who earns $50,000 per year to support
<br>
a family of eight may have a farm which either as a company or sold off
<br>
as assets may be worth several million dollars. While technically a
<br>
'multi-millionaire', he is living at a subsistence level and when he
<br>
dies and leaves the farm to one or more children, inheritance taxes will
<br>
require the heir to mortgage half the value of the farm to pay the death
<br>
taxes, which with interest comes out to the full value (or more) of the
<br>
farm, thus making each generation buy its own farm back from the
<br>
government and the banks.
<br>
<p>I understand that, being an Brit, Mr. Stross is likely subject to the
<br>
general British/European meme that anyone who owns more land than their
<br>
immediate home is a member of the aristocracy, and therefore
<br>
automatically guilty of being a robber baron.
