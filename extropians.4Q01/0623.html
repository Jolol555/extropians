<em>&gt; &gt; I'm doing YADA work at the moment (Yet Another Database App),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I've run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into an old problem for which there never seems to be a really good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solution. This particular app is targetted at RDBMS Brand X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (actually it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sybase), and now there is a need to retarget it to another RDBMS. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; positive that more databases will creep into the story over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, so this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the old database-independent-app problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hear you!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is actually close to my speciality.  I've been doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistence middleware and object persistence especially for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of the last 15 years.  My speciality is object persistence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and especially through middleware I created.  I just finished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the grand opus of this work (unfortunately proprietary to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employer for now) in Java.  The performance is quite good.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system includes in memory caching, multiple threading, its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lock manager and an adapter framework for plugging in different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; database products.  It doesn't matter if they are even of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same type (all relational for instance).  At the top the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applications only see the middleware API.  Also included is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; builtin support for binary relations, persistent collections and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistent queues.  There is room in the architecture to scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and distribute the lock manager and cache and to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language adapters for different software language object and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure persistence.   The system supports dynamically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difining new object/structs whose instances can then be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persisted, queried, related to other instances and so on.
</em><br>
<p>I was going to mention object persistence as the solution to your
<br>
problem...always add another level of abstraction. Solves everything except
<br>
too many layers of abstraction.
<br>
<p>One of my open source projects
<br>
(<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/dwengine/">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/dwengine/</a>) includes a Java object
<br>
persistence layer that's fairly specific to certain types of data. It's in
<br>
the process of being implemented with various diffrent databases.
<br>
<p>But anyhow, my point was going to be that a million solutions already exist
<br>
out there. The trick is using one of them from the get-go. Salvaging a
<br>
system in which one of those solutions wasn't used is always going to be
<br>
messy.
<br>
<p>The day that someone comes up with a good general framework for upgrading
<br>
arbitrary legacy systems to, say, EJB, will be a good day. I'm not sure that
<br>
it's possible, however.
