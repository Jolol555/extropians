&quot;Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.
<br>
Unreality is that which, when you stop believing in it, comes to nothing.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wonder if you agree with Einstein's letter to a friend (Eugene Wigner?) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the passing of their ally, Michelle Besso, caused Einstein to remember 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;time was merely an illusion, although a persistant one?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mitch
</em><br>
<p>Michele Besso died in march 15, 1955, four weeks before 
<br>
Einstein's death. E. wrote to Vero and Bice Besso (on march 25): 
<br>
&quot;Now he has departed a little ahead of me from this quaint world. 
<br>
This means nothing. For us faithful physicists, the separation 
<br>
between past, present, and future has only the meaning of
<br>
an illusion, though a persistent one.&quot; [Einstein Archive, reel 7-245].
<br>
<p>Einstein seems to have embraced Weyl's idea. An idea which
<br>
seriously conflicts with the Judeo &amp; Christian tradition, which
<br>
assigns to time a very active role in history.
<br>
<p>Weyl's idea was that &quot;]T]he objective world simply *is*, it does not *happen*.
<br>
Only to the gaze of my consciousness, crawling upward along the lifeline
<br>
of my body, does a section of this world come to life as a fleeting image
<br>
in space which continuosly changes in time.&quot; [H. Weyl, Philosophy of
<br>
Mathematics and Natural Science, Princeton U.P., 1949, p. 116).
<br>
<p>Clearly Weyl thought the Minkowski's 4-dimensional space-time as
<br>
a &quot;block universe&quot;. But there is no cohesive global concept of past (of 
<br>
what?) and future (of what?), imo. Because there are also flat spaces and, 
<br>
perhaps, even closed time loops.
<br>
<p>In the Timaeus [37c-38a] Plato described how the Demiurge - who was 
<br>
eternal -sought to create an eternal universe. 
<br>
&quot;[T]o attach Eternity in its entirety to what is generated was impossible, 
<br>
therefore He resolved to make a moving likeness of Eternity which abides 
<br>
in unity. He made an eternal image, moving according to number, that 
<br>
which we name 'time' &quot;
<br>
<p>Well, I prefer Plato.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately this also brings lots of problems. In example J.T. Wilcox
<br>
[Relativity, Simultaneity, and Divine Omniscience, thesis, Atlanta, 1956]
<br>
wrote &quot;How there can be divine knowledge of a relativistic universe?&quot;.
<br>
<p>But the answer, now, is blowing in the wind.
<br>
<p>-s.
<br>
<p>Is there a real time ordering behind the nonlocal correlations?
<br>
Antoine Suarez
<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110124">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110124</a>
<br>
It is argued that recent experiments with moving beam-splitters demonstrate 
<br>
that there is no real time ordering behind the nonlocal correlations: 
<br>
In Bell's world there is no &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Quantum correlations versus Multisimultaneity: an experimental test
<br>
Andre Stefanov, Nicolas Gisin, Antoine Suarez, Hugo Zbinden
<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110117">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110117</a>
<br>
Multisimultaneity is a causal model of relativistic quantum physics 
<br>
which assigns a real time ordering to any set of events, 
<br>
much in the spirit of the pilot-wave picture. Contrary to standard
<br>
quantum mechanics, it predicts a disappearance of the correlations 
<br>
in a Bell-type experiment when both analysers are in relative motion 
<br>
such that, each one in its own inertial reference frame, is first to select 
<br>
the output of the photons. We tested this prediction using acousto-optic 
<br>
modulators as moving beam-splitters and interferometers separated by 55 m. 
<br>
We didn't observe any disappearance of the correlations, thus refuting 
<br>
Multisimultaneity.
