<p><em>&gt; ### Phlogiston as a hypothesis was useless mainly because it failed to
</em><br>
give
<br>
<em>&gt; falsifiable predictions, AFAIK. Vitalism was abandoned once its
</em><br>
predictions
<br>
<em>&gt; were experimentally disproved (Wohler's synthesis of urea).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I liked the phlogiston theory.  It said that burning was caused by
<br>
a single substance.  That substance is released by burning.  (Evidence for
<br>
this was that burned objects are almost always lighter than the original.)
<br>
<p>The theory was almost right.  Burning is caused by a single substance
<br>
(oxygen).  Where the theory was wrong was in predicting that burning was a
<br>
breaking down of molecules, rather than the building up of molecules.
<br>
<p>It did imply that no outside substance is needed for burning.  Since this
<br>
prediction was proved false, the phlogiston theory was discarded.  Like a
<br>
search that proves the wanted item is not in a particular room, the
<br>
phlogiston theory was useful for disproving some (alleged) causes of
<br>
burning.
<br>
<p><p>P.S.  The reason I enjoyed the phlogiston theory is that some metals
<br>
(magnesium?) become heavier with burning.  For a short while it was
<br>
theorized that phlogiston had negative weight.  If they had seen the
<br>
Hindenberg they would have been convinced they were right.
