<p>Yes, but you only need lawyers to argue if bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki
<br>
conformed with the Geneva Conventions or not, that has nothing to with morality.

<p><em>    &gt;Your argument above makes sense, but I was told about  two wrongs not

<p>I suppose a million American casualties in a invasion of Japan would be viewed as a
<br>
wrong too by Americans, a wrong they wanted to avoid. We'll never know if the numbers
<br>
really would have been that high but it's not unreasonable for the leaders of that time to
<br>
think they would be, certainly many thousands of soldiers thought the nuclear bomb had
<br>
saved their life.
