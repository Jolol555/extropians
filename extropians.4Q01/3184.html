<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; You needn't stretch to find worse US parallels.  Dresden, Hiroshima,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; and Nagasaki were all straight-up terrorist acts - trying to force
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; action onto governments/societies by killing civilians in areas of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; minimal military importance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dresen, certainly, because the war was pretty much already over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and it didn't accomplish anything but a sense of retribution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which I agree isn't as effective in international relations as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it might be in interpersonal ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But Hiroshima and Nagasaki were different: at the time, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was no reason to belive the war wouldn't continue for a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time, at the cost of many thousands of lives.  A show of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;devastating, overwhelming, terrifying force against an enemy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that was clearly the agressor, leaving him no choice but total
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unconditional surrender, accomplished exactly the right goal:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;war over, lives saved, no questions.
</em><br>
<p>But the action wasn't against the aggressor or even the aggressor's
<br>
assets.  It  was taken against tens of thousands of basically 
<br>
innocent people who just happened to live in the wrong city.
<br>
Yes, the idea was that the horrible deaths of thousands of 
<br>
innocents would force the government of those people to surrender
<br>
- exactly what the WTC bombers were trying to do, just on a
<br>
larger scale.  Are you saying terrorism is OK if it works?
<br>
Or if it's done in a &quot;good cause&quot;?
