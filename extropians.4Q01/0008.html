<p><p>.30-06 = ~900 m/s
<br>
12ga = ~400 m/s
<br>
<p><p>What you are forgetting is that, unless the plane is on top of you, you have
<br>
to compensate both for the motion of the plane *AND* the ballistic
<br>
trajectory of the bullet.  With a target moving that fast, this takes
<br>
extraordinary amounts of practice to even have a faint hope of hitting
<br>
anything.
<br>
<p>An excellent example is shooting clay pigeons with a rifle.  Not impossible,
<br>
but something a skilled shooter can learn to do with some practice.
<br>
However, when you are shooting clay pigeons, the target is close enough that
<br>
you can ignore the ballistic trajectory of the bullet and only compensate
<br>
for the flight path of the target.  When you are shooting an airplane, you
<br>
have to take the ballistic trajectory of the bullet into consideration in
<br>
addition to the trajectory of the plane.  Shooting off-hand, this could
<br>
easily lead to a miss if you misjudge even slightly.  And most people don't
<br>
even know the basics, like shooting over the plane rather than at it.
<br>
<p>So shooting an aircraft with a rifle involves both knowing how to compensate
<br>
for flight trajectories (like with a shotgun) AND knowing how to compensate
<br>
for ballistic trajectories of the bullet (like long-range rifle shooting).
<br>
Unless you can do both in real-time at the same time, your odds of hitting
<br>
anything are almost nil because your shooting instincts will most likely be
<br>
wrong for that situation.  Which is why having the proles try to shoot down
<br>
crop dusters is probably a bad idea for the most part without some
<br>
substantial education on the matter.
