<p>Aside from post-war &quot;wars&quot; which are really police actions, this sort of 
<br>
thing isn't all that common. My understanding is that hardly any army in 
<br>
the world trains for urban warfare as it is just too difficult.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My impression
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a countryside since they will not obligingly concentrate in front of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your superior firepower, or indeed present themselves for attack at all. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A city is a clearly defined target where you can make full use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overwhelming force, though fighting house-to-house once you've taken the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;city can turn into another guerilla problem.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But, you can't take the city without fighting house-to-house.  It's 
<br>
nothing but houses (and other buildings).
<br>
Consider Stalingrad. Full-on house-to-hose fighting, with no clear 
<br>
winner at any point at any time, as it's really hard to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But, again, that's *after*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you've taken the city.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How do you take a city without entering it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I never heard that guerillas had the reputation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being able to make a stand and defend a target from superior enemy forces;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in fact, from what I've heard that's exactly what guerillas don't do. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, true,  but this wasn't supposed to be a guerilla war. Although 
<br>
it's about to turn into one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Enemy advances, we retreat.&quot;  That's why I was nonplussed by all the fuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over the taking of Kabul.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think a bit more resistance was expected.
