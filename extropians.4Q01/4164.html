re:'Question for the drummers:  Why does sloppy drummer timing sound
<br>
&quot;organic&quot;
<br>
and sloppy MIDI timing sound &quot;sloppy&quot;?  I don't hear a difference, but I've
<br>
seen it justified this way many times.  Drummers that actually have
<br>
excellent timing (i.e. sub-millisecond) are extremely rare, so perhaps it is
<br>
a way of justifying abilities that are less than excellent.'
<br>
<p>They sound organic because the imperfections in timing come from
<br>
anticipation, emotional reactions (tend to speed up to transitions etc.),
<br>
interplay with other musicians, drum head --&gt; stick  --&gt; arm --&gt; brain
<br>
interactions etc.
<br>
so the timing imperfections are non-random.
<br>
sloppy MIDI timing sounds &quot;sloppy&quot; because they do not have as yet a
<br>
'perfect' algorithm to emulate the natural errors,
<br>
non-linear distortion artifacts from vinyl or tube amp effects are also
<br>
pleasant to the ear for most people, much effort has been made to emulate
<br>
these artifacts in digital.

genre
<br>
: &gt; of &quot;Electronica&quot; has branched out from being essentially one style of
<br>
: &gt; music, to being literally hundreds of variations on a style such as we

have
<br>
: &gt; today (Ambient, Drum N' Bass, Progressive Electronica, House, Jungle,
<br>
Goa,
<br>
: &gt; Techno etc.).  I would argue that this is a direct by-product of having
<br>
: &gt; more tools available to express one's creative leanings.  Newer
<br>
: &gt; technologies in music (as in all fields) lead to more options, and
<br>
: &gt; ultimately more creativity.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: A majority of the new genre creation is entirely unnecessary.  Most people
<br>
: are unable to tell you what the difference is between half the genres.
<br>
And
<br>
: of all these dozens of genres, only a couple are fundamentally new at the
<br>
: composition level.  Many genres don't define much other than a particular
<br>
: sound used to make it e.g. trance is almost entirely defined by the use of
<br>
: the &quot;hoover&quot; sound (for the semi-layman, detuned PWM oscillators in unison
<br>
: mode typically used with an inverted pitch envelope -- originally found as
<br>
a
<br>
: preset on the old Roland Alpha Juno).
<br>
:
<br>
: I would say that the most unique thing to come out of the '90s that hadn't
<br>
: been done before in music, was proper Drum 'n' Bass (e.g. LTJ Bukem and
<br>
: Talvin Singh).  Most of the other &quot;new&quot; genres were barely distinguishable
<br>
: deviations of existing stuff, such that the differences probably fall
<br>
below
<br>
: the noise floor of normal differences between given artists in the same
<br>
: genre.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: &gt; In my opinion, the biggest area that
<br>
: &gt; musical technology has and will continue to affect is in the production
<br>
: &gt; end, as opposed to the writing and performance end.  Being able to
<br>
: &gt; digitally smooth out and process any aspect of an analog-initiated
<br>
: &gt; performance is a very valuable tool nowadays.  Just try to find any
<br>
decent
<br>
: &gt; producer or engineer who hasn't used Pro Tools yet.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: I agree that the technology is getting ridiculously good and only getting
<br>
: better.  However, Pro Tools is primarily of useful for editing live
<br>
: recordings in the studio.  For productions that are fundamentally
<br>
: electronic, Logic Audio rules the roost.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: &gt; I don't foresee analog
<br>
: &gt; guitars and basses being phased out anytime soon, but the analog drum
<br>
kit
<br>
: &gt; will soon be a goner, I fear.  Most musicians (at least, the ones who
<br>
are
<br>
: &gt; not drummers...) only want a steady beat to play to.  The labor of
<br>
finding
<br>
: &gt; a drummer (let alone a good one) and hauling around the multitude of
<br>
: &gt; equipment the average drummer has is rather redundant, when you can get
<br>
: &gt; digital equipment that is almost always the equal of an analog (i.e.
<br>
flesh
<br>
: &gt; and blood) drummer.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: That's a good observation.  I have a library of over 10,000 drum samples
<br>
: that I use and an increasing number of very good percussion synthesizers
<br>
: (including physical models for most parts of a drum kit).  Most of the
<br>
sound
<br>
: and performance aspects of a drummer are available to me if I want to add
<br>
: those as well.  So a drummer is replaceable in the studio at least.
<br>
:
<br>
: In truth though, I simply love the sound of sample-accurate timing (which
<br>
is
<br>
: accurate to within 10-20 microseconds on most hardware).  I *had* been
<br>
using
<br>
: a MIDI sampler, which is only accurate to within maybe 3-5 milliseconds
<br>
and
<br>
: has a bit of random variation in the timing.  I didn't think it would be a
<br>
: big deal, but the difference between going from a MIDI sampler to a
<br>
: sample-accurate Logic Audio soft sampler (the EXS24) was like night and
<br>
day.
<br>
: Sample accurate drum tracks sound *tight*.  Highly recommended.

<br>
:
<br>
: &gt; Not to be overly obvious, but I also think that the digification of
<br>
analog
<br>
: &gt; instruments will increase steadily for the next number of years.  Look
<br>
to
<br>
: &gt; see more and more of those old Mellotrons, Hammond and Farfisa organs,
<br>
: &gt; Moogs, Prophets, Jupiters and VCS3s become MIDIfied and used in more
<br>
: &gt; commercial recordings.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: The digital models of the old analog monsters are becoming VERY good.  A
<br>
: couple existing models are indistinguishable from the real thing (e.g. the
<br>
: OASYS has a Prophet-5 DSP model that is shockingly perfect, though the DSP
<br>
: model was designed by the same guy that made the original Prophet-5).  We
<br>
: are only a few years from getting to the point where everything can be
<br>
: cheaply modeled in DSP.  We are pretty much at that point now for analog
<br>
: synthesizers.
<br>
:
<br>
: The holy grail of physical modeling, the piano, has almost dropped into
<br>
the
<br>
: range of commercially viable DSP requirements (Moore's Law marches on).
<br>
: I've heard from knowledgeable people (at Korg R&amp;D) that the piano models
<br>
: sound indistinguishable from the real thing, but the fact that it
<br>
originally
<br>
: required multiple high-end DSPs for each note when it was first created
<br>
: meant that you would have to have a DSP mainframe to have a usable
<br>
: instrument.
<br>
:
<br>
:
<br>
: &gt; As for me, I'm just happy with my Korgs!
<br>

<br>
:
<br>
: Me too.  (Wavestation A/D, Z1, and OASYS)
