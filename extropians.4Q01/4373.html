<p>One can quote verses from the Bible and even without as much

interpretation as bin

<br>
to death immediately, 
<br>
several times over. 
<br>
<p>Does this mean that all Christians or all fundamentalist
<br>
Christians are my enemy? No?
<br>
Scripture can be quoted out of context and under some

interpretation to rationalize
<br>
most anything.  But reading bin Laden in context does not lead
<br>
me to believe he thinks
<br>
all who are not Islamic fundamentalist should be killed.  But I

realize others
<br>
read things differently.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amara, I suspect that neither you nor Samantha nor Anders

<em>&gt; we were lying.  This nation cannot be ruled by the koran.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I also will not give in to the tyranny of fear or the litany of
<br>
dehumanization. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The Taliban seem to have a special hatred for the US, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they also consider all of Europe as the home of infidels.  Guided
</em><br>
<p>I could go into exactly why the Taliban and many in that area
<br>
have reason to
<br>
hate the US or at least its policies.  But I would be repeating
<br>
myself.  Hint:
<br>
It is not because we are infidels (although that word is usually
<br>
reserved for
<br>
other than simply non-Muslims) that they primarily hate us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; by the words of Mohammed, they would fight there as well, until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every European confesses that there is no god but allah.  Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be ruled by the koran.  Asia cannot be ruled by a koran-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspired tyrant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Please.  You cannot reasonably claim that Mohammed orders them
<br>
to kill all non-Muslims.
<br>
This is historically, religiously and theologically false.  As I
<br>
have said
<br>
many times it is also a very dangerous mis-interpretation
<br>
likely, if believed widely,
<br>
to turn this world into a bloodbath.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Given that we have no advanced meme-destroying weaponry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are stuck with the ancient technique of destroying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meme carrier.  The evidence is sufficient: OBL and his minions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate us, they want us dead.  We want us alive.  I am open to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestion here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Many people hate us.  Will we kill them all or see if they have
<br>
some legitimate complaints
<br>
and, where this is so, make some changes?  Isn't the second
<br>
required of reasonably
<br>
civilized people? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...I couldn't escape the feeling that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; place where I was born and lived for most of my life (the U.S.) has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gone a little bit insane.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted.  This is what happens in war.  War is a crime.  We hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all war and wish to end it.  Ideally all killing should end.  How?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You cannot just blame it on war.  We are acting in an insane
<br>
manner. Each
<br>
of us has a choice how we act and respond and how we hold those
<br>
who claim to be our 
<br>
servants to acting in ways we consider reasonable.
<br>
<p>How? By refusing to kill and refusing to dehumanize people. 
<br>
Non-humans cannot
<br>
be reached.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Before I moved out of the U.S. ~4 years ago, I was, in a small way, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pacifist, believing that one doesn't answer violence with yet again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more violence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, we are open to suggestion.  Appeasement will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop the violence.  This planet will not be ruled by the koran.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is not appeasement to stop the wrong things we do and have
<br>
been doing and to
<br>
repair what damage we can.  It is simple justice.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I also believe that any group's rampant unhappiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or disrest has an element of truth embedded, and it must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; addressed in a civil way...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...Short or worshipping allah or wearing beards/burqas please.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you think that is a justifiable response?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Honestly, we cannot stop our culture from invading theirs, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we cannot stop radio waves.  Our government does not control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business, it does not control Hollywood Incorporated.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US government cannot be held responsible for that which our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own first amendment prevents it from controlling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Cultural invasion is not the problem and it is disingenous to
<br>
suggest it is.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The Taliban hate the infidel because they know their own people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will choose the ways of the infidel over the ways of allah,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *if given the freedom to choose*.  If their people can pick up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Baywatch, they will do so.  The reprehensible Taliban fights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by destroying freedom, in order to preserve their deplorable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes.  If you can think of a way to destroy those memes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without destroying the meme carriers, we are open to suggestion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;sigh&gt;
<br>
You can only change memes by giving people a choice that works
<br>
better for them.
<br>
There is much in US culture and especially in our media that
<br>
really is pretty
<br>
damn empty of values when you get down to it.  Certainly it
<br>
isn't going to 
<br>
hit people in much of the MidEast as being a much better set of
<br>
memes.  Personally
<br>
I don't for a moment think the US and/or Europe has across the
<br>
board the best
<br>
memes.  I think a lot of cultures have some memes worth picking
<br>
and choosing from
<br>
including MidEast ones.  
<br>
<p>If you want to stop a lot of the hatred then stop the knee-jerk
<br>
support of Israel.  Remove
<br>
our military bases from Muslim holy lands.  They are real
<br>
symbols of foreign oppression to
<br>
the people, not just to bin Laden.  Osama bin Laden would not
<br>
have a hundredth the power and
<br>
support without the people also being offended by these things. 
<br>
Stop manipulating the governments
<br>
of countries in the region to the extent of installing whatever
<br>
party, no matter how disasterous
<br>
and barbaric, that is good for American business or for our
<br>
perceived military objectives.  Stop
<br>
bombing Iraq and lift the sanctions.  The &quot;collateral damage&quot; is
<br>
much too high for any claimed 
<br>
gain that is substantiated.  Make sure the Palestinians get a
<br>
fair shake and stop calling them
<br>
terrorists when they fight back but never calling Israel
<br>
terrorists when it acts as badly or worse
<br>
toward them. 
<br>
<p>That would be a possible start.  That bin Laden also wants some
<br>
of these things does not
<br>
mean for a moment that they are thus wrong-headed.  His means
<br>
are despicable but that does not
<br>
mean that all of his complains are.  Rational people must be
<br>
able to separate the two.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...or the violent cycle will continue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no doubts there will be more terrorism.  Our infrastructure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is still very vulnerable, especially airlines and roads.  We need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better technology for discovering and preventing such attacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is something every pacifist will support.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We need to stop acting like global bullies and like other
<br>
cultures and people do not
<br>
matter.  We will never ever have enough technology and &quot;home
<br>
security&quot; to be invulnerable.
<br>
We had best learn to live with our neighbors and turn them into
<br>
friends where possible.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't know if my observations are useful to anyone in the U.S. and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I won't entertain arguments or debates, since they are mostly my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observations. I'll only state that I'm very worried with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; direction that the U.S. humans (and others) on this planet are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; following.  Amara
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As are we all.  But let us look at the positive for a minute.  Right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or wrong, the war will be over in a few days.  As I suspected, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are masses of middle eastern infidels whose rights were crushed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the Taliban.  These people are free now, or at least freer than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You are dreaming.  The folks in the Pentagon and in the White
<br>
House and in Justice do not
<br>
by any stretch of the imagination plan to end the war in a few
<br>
days.  Too much is invested.
<br>
I greatly wish that they did.  Instead we will look for the next
<br>
country to hunt terrorists in, the next
<br>
people to dehumanize, the next place to bomb.  And at home we
<br>
will use the disasterous
<br>
rights-denying laws we have hastily passed to harrass, imprison
<br>
(perhaps worse) a lot of people, 
<br>
citizen and non-citizen alike.  We are now closing down
<br>
international relief agencies for chrissake! Without a court
<br>
proceeding or any evidence but some bureaucrat's claim they are
<br>
somehow or another supporting
<br>
terrorism.  The great danger is not foreign terrorists.  It is
<br>
our own government.  Beware.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I am looking for something analogous to a capitalist/feminist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolution to sweep over the Arab world, which will revolutionize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their society in a much more fundamental way than did the cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolution of the 1960s here.  I foresee a backlash against any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of religious compulsion.  Middle eastern countries may write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some form of a first amendment into their own governmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutions.  I believe we need the meme of universal freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of conscience before we have any chance at world peace.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can all work towards that goal, regardless of where on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet we choose to live.  spike
</em><br>
<p>This sounds good.  At least the freedom of conscience part
<br>
does.  I hope we still
<br>
practice it and the rest of our rights a year from now.
