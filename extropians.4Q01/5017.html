<em>&gt; &gt; In my own locality of King County, Washington, voters defeated an

</em><br>
Yes.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; While some people think Affirmative Action itself is &quot;racist&quot; (even
</em><br>
though
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the group of people who've benefited the most from Affirmative Action in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; past, I believe, have been &quot;white&quot; women) I think it balances things out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better (and much faster) than if humans were left to root out for the
</em><br>
milk
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of human kindness on their own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you say that you support affirmative action, despite the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people who have benefitted the most, women, are actually the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of the population, to the detriment of the male minority? Isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that rather bigoted of you?
</em><br>
<p>Hell, no.  I am for gender equality.  I think women not working (and not
<br>
pulling their own weight) is detrimental to men!  Equal rights = equal
<br>
responsibility, eh?  How does that make me bigoted?  I support men - I want
<br>
women to get their asses in gear and stop playing victim-victim.  As to the
<br>
business of majority-minority, it's essentially meaningless.  In Africa a
<br>
few years ago when apartheid was in flower it was the majority of the
<br>
population that suffered under the minority colonial rule.  What is
<br>
important is oppression - who oppresses whom and why, and what happens as a
<br>
result.
<br>
<p>O.

<em>&gt; &gt; While Mike may not have been complaining directly, it seemed as if he
</em><br>
were
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; playing a kind of &quot;blame game&quot; with racist overtones, at the very least.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are reading my posts with excrement-colored glasses.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; He simply gave his view of why he lost his job, fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; plausibly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And I've simply given my view of how what Mike said came across to me.
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have nothing against Mike personally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously not, obviously. While I don't care how you think of me, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does bother me that a person such as yourself could make such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsubstantiated leaps of illogic, prejudice, and admit to her own bias
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the majority against the minority, yet somehow be offended when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude, more due to your own prejudices than anything I actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrote, that I am somehow racist. That such people continue to populate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list allegedly devoted to rationality and logic speaks volumes for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of verbal strife that continues here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also find it rather disengenuous that you a) consider me a racist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despite a lack of my actually demonstrating same, and b) are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally offended by such a conclusion. If you so readily jump to such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a conclusion on a total lack of real evidence, it is obvious that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are looking for something to be offended by. The least you can do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admit it.
