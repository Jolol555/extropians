<p>
Subliminal study shows subconscious learning is possible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991476">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991476</a>
<br>
Subconscious learning probably is possible, say US researchers. What's more,
<br>
subconscious learning may affect our conscious decisions - without our
<br>
realising it.
<br>
<p>Takeo Watanabe and his colleagues at Boston University found that people who
<br>
had watched a particular direction of subliminal dot movement during a
<br>
letter-naming trial were significantly better at picking it out later.
<br>
<p>The finding challenges the idea that attention is an essential element of the
<br>
learning process. &quot;Attention can make learning more efficient,&quot; says Watanabe,
<br>
&quot;but it's not necessary.&quot;
<br>
<p>Watanabe dismisses gimmicks such as cassettes that purport to teach you while
<br>
you sleep. But he speculates that listening to a foreign language being spoken
<br>
at low volume - loud enough that your brain can perceive it but not so loud
<br>
that you are aware - could improve a person's pronunciation and listening
<br>
skills. &quot;It could be useful,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Cognitive aspects such as sentence structure and semantics would not be
<br>
affected, he suspects.
<br>
<p>Dancing dots
<br>
Watanabe's team asked volunteers to name certain letters presented on a
<br>
screen. Meanwhile, behind the letters, dots danced randomly - or so it
<br>
appeared. In fact, one in 20 shared a direction. This was just below the
<br>
threshold of conscious perception.
<br>
<p>The volunteers did this letter-naming task for an hour every day for a month.
<br>
Then they were asked to do another series of tests. These involved watching
<br>
moving dots and identifying any underlying pattern, or saying whether two
<br>
displays of dots moved in the same direction. In both of these cases only
<br>
about one in 10 dots were moving coherently - an activity that was just above
<br>
the conscious threshold.
<br>
<p>The team found that people who had watched a particular direction of movement
<br>
during the first series of tests were significantly better at picking it out
<br>
later.
<br>
<p>Advertising influence
<br>
&quot;I think it's one of the nicest sets of data I've seen for learning outside of
<br>
perceptual awareness,&quot; says Phil Merikle, at the University of Waterloo in
<br>
Canada.
<br>
<p>But there's an important conclusion that the authors don't stress, he says.
<br>
The study shows that what the volunteers learned subconsciously during the
<br>
trials influences their conscious experience.
<br>
<p>&quot;This perceptual learning is influencing how they see the world,&quot; says Merkle.
<br>
Subconscious learning may affect our conscious decisions - without our knowing
<br>
it. &quot;It's what advertisers have known all along: if we just keep the exposure
<br>
rate up, people will be influenced.&quot;

<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)
