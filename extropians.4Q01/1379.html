<p><p>Yeah, I'm mostly a software guy. I've been developing products for 30
<br>
years, but they don't have moving parts.. I envision a tele-operated
<br>
mail opener connected to the back end of conventional &quot;mail handling
<br>
equipment&quot;. The mailroom guy would dump the mail into the input hopper
<br>
of the mail handling equipment, which would then output one pieces at
<br>
a time into the teleoperated opener, where the operator would open the
<br>
pieces and scan them. A glove box would suffice, but it's not cool
<br>
enough and is not amenable to later automation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt;You are correct that reading scanned text or Fax on the screen is slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for some people, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nearly everyone who speed-reads, AFAICT. Also, with &quot;landscape&quot; format and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current screen sizes, one can't take in an entire page at a glance.
</em><br>
<p><p>For those of you who can really benefit for it, print the file to a
<br>
high-quality printer and read it that way. today's scanners easily reach
<br>
2400 dpi, good printers can reach 1200 dpi. You'll contend with paper, but
<br>
gain the rest of the advantages of scanning and storing your correspondence.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and you are correct that the problem is the display,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not the scanner. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is the system. 200 dpi is actually below the measured threshold,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the knee starts around there. 300 dpi is adequate, as many laser printer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sales appear to confirm. Paper carries more information than a scanner can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmit. The value of that information is not calculable by Shannon methods.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;From this I infer that you don't read stuff that was generated by
<br>
computer and then printed? Such a paper copy cannot have more 
<br>
information than was already in the computer in the first place.
