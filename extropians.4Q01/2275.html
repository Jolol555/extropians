<em>&gt; &gt; What could explain the mindset that would produce this kind of thinking? I

<em>&gt; Heh.  David Brin has explored this very thesis in a collection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Otherness.&quot;  It has a tendency to collapse in complete social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativism, at which point it gets devoured by barbarians.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that is Brin's conclusion, and it doesn't fit with his
<br>
themes in _The Transparent Society_. He instead seems to think that this
<br>
acceptance and love of the other is one of the reasons the West has
<br>
worked so well.
<br>
<p>I think he is roughly right. Any meme when taken to a silly extent
<br>
becomes counterproductive (a bit of a circular definition), but this
<br>
tolerance and interest for the other (combined with a scepticism of
<br>
one's own culture) has allowed many useful outside memes to take root in
<br>
our culture. It becomes dangerous when it is not balanced by critical
<br>
analysis of whether the memes keep their promises.
<br>
<p>In the case of the extreme tolerance meme, which is related to the
<br>
cultural relativism meme-complex, we have a situation where being
<br>
intolerant is viewed as unacceptable. And since in many circles
<br>
intolerant is equated to criticising others (since this might hurt their
<br>
feelings, which are regarded as sacrosanct both due to the general
<br>
tolerance for others and clinging remnants of the romantic/prerational
<br>
idea of feelings rather than reason as the truest form of knowledge), in
<br>
these circles criticism becomes inhibited except when turned outwards
<br>
against the &quot;intolerant&quot;. 
<br>
<p>As for judging the Blight vs. Countermeasure, Steel vs. Woodcarver, it
<br>
can only be done relative to some standard. I would use whether they
<br>
promoted happiness and self-development among other beings, and then the
<br>
choice becomes rather clear: Steel is clearly using other beings for his
<br>
own purposes with no interest in their self-development, while
<br>
Woodcarver does it; the Blight uses other beings as expendable tools for
<br>
its own purposes on a far wider scale than Countermeasure. None of the
<br>
characters end up 100% on the good or evil side, but you can make
<br>
distinctions between them.
