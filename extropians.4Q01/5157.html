<em>&gt; That said, I assume Mike's linking of ACLU with 2nd Amendment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues in a negative way is due to the ACLU being neutral on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue due to their (I believe quite errorneous) state militia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (collectivist) interpretation of what the 2nd amendment is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about.  But this rather common error does not in any wise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify a claim that the ACLU is a bunch of &quot;terrorists&quot; or out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to destroy civil rights.  Such an allegation is inflammatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hyperbole.  
</em><br>
<p>The ACLU is far more than neutral. They have filed numerous amicus curae
<br>
briefs with the courts against the individual rights interpretation, and
<br>
they are also involved in the Trauma Project, an alliance of the AMA,
<br>
APA, the ABA, and the ACLU along with Handgun Control Inc (now styling
<br>
itself as &quot;The Brady Project&quot;) and Andrew McKelvey's (of monster.com
<br>
fame) Americans for Gun Safety in a Orwellian project to assemble a
<br>
private nationwide database of gun ownership by violating the medical
<br>
privacy rights of private citizens. If your doctor is aware of, or has
<br>
asked you, your spouse, or your children if there are firearms in your
<br>
household, in the past three years, then you are now on this database.
<br>
<p>Despite this sort of invasiveness being a 'boundary issue' ethical
<br>
violation of doctor-patient confidentiality, millions of family doctors
<br>
and emergency room staffers are engaging in this illegal campaign to
<br>
identify all gun owners in the US. Furthermore, they are advising family
<br>
members of gun owners of the alleged 'risks' of gun ownership (despite
<br>
the total lack of training by such practitioners in risk assessment or
<br>
risk management, a lack of certification in the same, and a lack of
<br>
liability insurance for the same). If, for instance, your wife is told
<br>
by her OB-GYN that your self defense pistol should be kept unloaded and
<br>
locked up in a safe at all times, they are placing themselves in a
<br>
position of liability if your lack of ability to access your firearm for
<br>
self defense results in injury, death, or other financial losses.
<br>
<p>The ACLU will, though, happily defend your doctor against your civil
<br>
suit in the event you take him/her to court, claiming that the doctor
<br>
has a first amendment right to disseminate the lies and propaganda of
<br>
the anti-gun movement, that whether the doctor is wrong or not is
<br>
immaterial to the doctors intent to help protect the patient from harm
<br>
(an argument that carries no water in malpractice case law, but would
<br>
play in front of a jury).
<br>
<p>The ACLU is as much a terrorist organization as the al Barakhat money
<br>
wiring organization in Somalia is. They may not get their own hands
<br>
bloody, but they enable the deaths of thousands.
