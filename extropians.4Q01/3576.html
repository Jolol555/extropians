<em>&gt; &gt;it is something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we could start right after lunch--at least we have the technology, we
</em><br>
just
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;need the resources and the political will. Imagine if genetic engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;smarter persons were taken on with the same sort of political enthusiasm
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;landing men on the moon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would also take twice as long, even if we could get it started right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after lunch. (Mmm... lunch.) Assuming you wish to allow your superhumans
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; mature, and they take the standard 15-25 years to do so. Neoteny suggests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they might take *longer* than normal, despite the evidence of Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other bright [former] kids.
</em><br>
You are certainly right about this. As Bonner notes (The Evolution of
<br>
Culture in Animals, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980, p. 50), .
<br>
there is a fairly reliable correlation between length of juvenile period and
<br>
brain size in primates, suggesting, perhaps, a protracted childhood for Homo
<br>
Bigheadus.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;The AI path seems likely to be swifter.
<br>
<em>&gt; Still, you note:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it would seem wise not to put all our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;posthuman eggs in one basket.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bigger problem is that now you *are* running into Kantian objections
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately, since it's likely that experiments along these lines wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work right on the first few dozen or maybe hundreds of kids; you'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing unpredictably deformed humans as probes. Morally preferable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait for the computational capacity to model complex phenotypic outcomes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd have thought. True, in the meantime the Singapore or Iraqi governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will do it, but they do all kinds of horrid things we shouldn't recommend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Well after lunch we should start with rats, pigs and then perhaps the pygmy
<br>
chimp. I agree that this may be all in vain if AI comes along in the
<br>
near-term. I know some are already packing their bags for the singularity.
<br>
(I haven't even done my laundry).  Of course the perennial worry is that AI
<br>
will take too long, hence, why we should work on a back-up plan. Obviously
<br>
the nicer thing would be if we could do something in vivo--avoiding at least
<br>
the issue of consent. Maybe all ask for some extra neurons from stem cells
<br>
for Christmas.
<br>
<p>Mark.
