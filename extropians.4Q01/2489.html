My concern regarding Anders view that Americans have a brain disorder is my 
<br>
perception (however adle-pated) that Europe is more off the map, then America 
<br>
is. Forgive my rant, for I am a cynic, and so perceive it in all others.
<br>
<p>My view on European policies, over the last several decades are this.
<br>
<p>Europe was soft on nazism, when it was in full bloom. Yes, much of the USA 
<br>
was also, but not to the degree Europe was, and they had reason to be 
<br>
anti-nazi more urgently. Perhaps their bargains with the Reich, even if it 
<br>
brought war to their own countries are Still, not considered, such a bad, 
<br>
bargain? 
<br>
<p>Europe was opportunistic, for business when the Soviet Union was in power, 
<br>
and leftist demonstrators were anti-American and pro-Soviet.
<br>
<p>Concurrently throughout this period they have catered to the middle eastern 
<br>
oil states, past 1956, thus, inadvertently assisting in development of 
<br>
radical, religious, Islam. I also remember how many Euro business catered to 
<br>
Sadam's war machine, and wonder how many still do?
<br>
<p>I would humbly remind those who feel that when this occurs in Europe, or 
<br>
Australia, with not just hundreds dead, but thousands; you will likely feel 
<br>
differently. 
<br>
<p>An I anti-European, no matter what? Lets say I am very distrustful, or 
<br>
paranoid.
<br>
<p>Are Europeans anti-American, no matter what? Some, sure seem to be. Again is 
<br>
it truth or merely perceptions?
