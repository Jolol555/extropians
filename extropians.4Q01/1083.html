<p>Not necessisarily.  I used to be a crazy microbiology student.
<br>
With my knowledge of other fields, I suspect I could accomplish
<br>
getting the particles down to that size.  You have to allow
<br>
for the fact that the knowledge for doing this has existed
<br>
for decades.  I haven't done a patent search but I would bet
<br>
there is something in the database that could be used in this
<br>
regard.  That first became open information with easy access
<br>
around '95-'96 or so when IBM started up the patent database server.
<br>
<p>People have had plenty of time since then to take advantage of
<br>
the resource.
<br>
<p>Because anthrax isn't contagious it isn't at the top of my
<br>
worry list.  People should notice we are adapting to the situation
<br>
very quickly.
<br>
<p>Al-Qaida:
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;These storms will not calm until you retreat in defeat in Afghanistan, stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your assistance to the Jews in Palestine, end the siege imposed on the Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, leave the Arabian peninsula, and stop your support for the Hindus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the Muslims in Kashmir,&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This is what they claimed, I believe, *after* the bombing started and
<br>
may be an attempt to widen general Islamic support against America
<br>
(swell the ranks of people who support them with money or bodies).
<br>
If you look at bin Laden's history he wants the U.S. out of Saudi
<br>
Arabia so he can bring down the royal family.  Its an economic
<br>
struggle because he views the rulers and their friends as extremely
<br>
corrupt having siphoned off a not-so-small fraction of the oil
<br>
wealth into their own pockets.
<br>
<p>We are going to be at risk until we get completely out of the
<br>
Middle-East.
<br>
<p>I'd also like to urge people to be calm and rational and respond with
<br>
cool-headed thought rather than hot-headed words.
<br>
<p>Robert
