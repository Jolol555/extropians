<p>I read a recent analysis and the &quot;wild card&quot; that seems to be making the
<br>
Simons right and the Erlichs wrong is technology (driven by human ingenuity).
<br>
The geologists are figuring out how to get more of the oil out of the
<br>
ground and still aren't getting a large fraction of it.  So there is
<br>
substantial room for improvement.
<br>
<p>If the plans the U.S. DOE has on the board for electricity production
<br>
get implemented over the next 10-20 years then I think the problem
<br>
is solved.  Everyone knows we have several hundred years of coal
<br>
resources and the electrical production efficiencies are slated to
<br>
jump from ~35% to &gt;80%.  Several hundred years give us plenty of
<br>
time to switch to solar power and/or fusion.  Cheap electricity lets
<br>
you switch to hydrogen as a locomotion fuel for most applications.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now answer for yourself, if you believe that nanoproduction of goods and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; services is a Cornucopian fantasy? It clearly is, in the sense of its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential, and what Drexler has indicated about it. But is it a dream that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to come true, or a pipe-dream?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;It clearly is&quot;?  Basis for assertion please?
<br>
Take a look at 3D printers.  What is there that is so hard to grasp
<br>
about the concepts of self-replication, exponential growth and the
<br>
concept of turning matter into &quot;software&quot;?
<br>
<p>I will not argue that it *will* be complex.  You aren't going to
<br>
design the precise location of every atom in an 18 billion atom
<br>
nanorobot yourself.  You are going to write the software that does
<br>
much of the work and actually directs the assembly process.  But
<br>
I've made the point in my Nano@Home paper -- the problem isn't
<br>
with the assembly process -- it is in having the designs.  If you
<br>
look around at all the nanomachinery we currently have (also known
<br>
as &quot;nature&quot;) its clearly going to be a big job designing the equivalent
<br>
and more -- but it doesn't require a great deal of actual
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; -- it simply requires the ability to create
<br>
and recognize good designs.
