<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; &gt; Not unrelated, last night we dropped 37,000 meals (and no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; medicines) or putting it in perspective, assuming all of those meals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; are delivered to people who need them, we provided meals for one day
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to 1/2% of the people who desperately need them. If we use all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; aircraft committed to date, and all of the flight crews, exclusively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to deliver food during daylight hours, we will be able to feed at most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; 3% of the starving population of Afghanistan - which will probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; mean that in February the Hajj will open to the news of 6 million plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; dead Afghans. And it will be portrayed and believed to be largely the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; fault of the US. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another analysis works less on utter catastrophe to American Policy, then a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more focused Al Qeidda meta- goal: The capture of Saudi Arabia and the rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Gulf States.  
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the meals are 2200 calories, enough to feed an adult a full
<br>
western diet. In extremis, it can feed two adults an 1100 calorie daily
<br>
ration, this is fully sufficient for kids and women as well, so the
<br>
numbers cited should be roughly doubled.
<br>
<p>Since the primary health problem is sanitation, the disinfectant
<br>
handi-wipes included in each ration will likely help reduce health
<br>
problems significantly (if the people using them understand what they
<br>
are for). The matches will also allow people to maintain fires to boil
<br>
water for sanitary purposes as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bin Ladin is a royal son of a royal house (so to speak)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and his family is the chief business organization that involves all major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction in the Gulf. The Bin Ladins have lived in the Boston area, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have donated heavilly to Harvard University. They have returned to Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabia on September 19th, 2001 because of safety concerns.
</em><br>
<p>Only a few bin Ladens lived in Boston, and at least one is still living
<br>
there. The fact that Osama has been disowned from the family eliminates
<br>
the 'royal son' status, although this does give him popular cachet with
<br>
the down and out muslims in 3rd world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one sees this as a primary goal of Bin Ladin's, then Robert J. Bradbury's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up-comming paper on Biomass production of fuels, should be the meta-goal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this group. Lastly, I am not so pessimistic on what the results will be from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our retaliation can achieve, especially if we do not get bogged-down in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfying coalition demands (especially the Saudi govt) in refraining from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying our enemy, as we did in Desert Storm.
</em><br>
<p>Better meta goals would be to boost energy efficiency. This costs far
<br>
less (around 1.5 cents per kwh saved) than investing in biomass and
<br>
results in better high tech advancements. Unless you can double the
<br>
photosynthetic efficiency of plants pronto, biomass is an economic drag
<br>
when oil prices are under $35-45 per barrel. Current prices are $24/bbl,
<br>
so unless the oil world suddenly imposes an oil embargo on the US,
<br>
biomass is a dumb idea. 
<br>
<p>Even if they do, it would be a smarter goal to invest in developing
<br>
Russian oil extraction and distribution infrastructure. Russia could
<br>
easily flood the oil market if its bottlenecks are eliminated.
<br>
<p>In the interim, major tax credits should be offered to investments in
<br>
development and tooling up for mass production of hybrid autos on the
<br>
same level as investments in oil exploration are currently 100% shielded
<br>
from taxation (i.e. all oil wildcat investments are deducted off the top
<br>
of taxable income, but you do pay gains taxes on returns on the
<br>
investment). Currently only research investments have a sub 100%
<br>
deduction, and tooling investments are taxed normally. Doubling auto
<br>
efficiency in a very short period will drive oil prices so low that oil
<br>
states will have to seriously curtail production in order to keep prices
<br>
up.
<br>
<p>This may risk destabilizing the governments of said states if done too
<br>
quickly, bit it will certainly make them far more responsive to the US'
<br>
concerns as well. Weaning them off the bottle will over time help
<br>
moderate them far more than it will hurt.
