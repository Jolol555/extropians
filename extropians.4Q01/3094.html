I haven't disagreed with anything you have stated, in the previous post, Mr. 
<br>
Pope. Also, I Do wish to pull out the rug from under the Wahabbi's, 
<br>
especially for financing all these Universities in the Islamic world,  with 
<br>
their anti-American propaganda. And yes, the Baathist socialists were modeled 
<br>
after the national socialists in 1930's Germany. I have hated the Ayatollah's 
<br>
and their Islamist cohorts to crumble. 
<br>
<p>I want to force America to conserve, I want alternatives to Persian Gulf oil, 
<br>
I want clean energy, especially for transportation. But, it will take enough 
<br>
pain, apparently, to encourage the market to make this move. Perhaps another 
<br>
few thousand Americans dead, from another attack will do this, perhaps not?
<br>
<p>In the meanwhile, for the purposes of this list, I would say that the views 
<br>
of those who &quot;understand&quot; (read: sympathize) with attackers of 9-11, will 
<br>
only make Extropian philosophy appear to be an outside fringe group. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The point you need to bear in mind is that these guys are a minority,
<br>
even in the Middle East. A small minority. And a good way of pulling the
<br>
rug out from under their feet would be to take a hard look at ethics in
<br>
foreign policy. Supporting any damn neo-Nazi regime or feudal monarchy
<br>
just because it's good for business may, well, be good for business, but
<br>
ultimately it builds up a charge of resentment that if you're not lucky
<br>
will find its way to you, rather than to the more appropriate targets
<br>
(the neo-Nazi dictatorships and those feudal Monarchies).&gt;&gt;
