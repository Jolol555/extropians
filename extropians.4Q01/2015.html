<p><em>&gt;That is contrary to what Bush is claiming about this war.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are out to end terrorism from what I have heard him say.  We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not out only against the particular ones who carried out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;9/11 attacks but all terrorists.  
</em><br>
<p>You are referring to the difference between the short term and long
<br>
term goals.
<br>
<p>I personally think the long term goal will fail as it degenerates
<br>
into the usual political bickering.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If we are not looking for a solution then this is just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vengeance.  It is not even about protecting ourselves from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;further terrorism or, to the extent possible, making terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less likely in the world.  Why should we have an unlimited and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unbounded committment to only that?
</em><br>
<p><p>I was wondering when you were going to raise the vengeance issue
<br>
again. Yes, it's partly vengeance, which I know you have a problem
<br>
with, But the families of the victims and millions of my fellow
<br>
Americans do not.
<br>
<p>By the way, if you destroy all the terrorists and their supporters,
<br>
there would be no more terrorism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The reasons they hate us are many, largely it seems because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are taught lies in Pakistani maddrasas, and are broadcast bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lies via Al-Jazeera television.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This is utterly simplistic.  To say that all who are angry with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us are dupes and liars is surely obviously biased and unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be accurate.  For one thing it denies real events that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;angered many in that part of the world.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>I don't find it particularly simplistic at all, I've watched a lot
<br>
of material on this, and as usual, when questioned those who oppose
<br>
us have very simplistic answers they can't particularly defend.
<br>
<p>I've already said I don't care if they hate us, I intend on making
<br>
it clear that if they attack us they will be destroyed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The Al-Jazeera is one of the few relatively independent voices
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the area.  I thought we are supposed to be for a free press. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or does that only apply in America and other rules apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anywhere else if they say unpleasant things about us?  I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we believe in free speech.  Only here?  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Al Jazeera is an Islamic media tabloid. They feed the population
<br>
exactly what they want to hear.
<br>
<p>They are part of the problem, I don't care if they exist or not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We are out to end this sort of thing on a permanent basis. We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sending a clear message: &quot;being a terrorist will get you hunted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down and killed, find another way to express your frustrations.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This is not the way to end terrorism.  It will not work and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never has worked throughout history.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
No terrorist who has been destroyed has ever committed another act
<br>
of terrorism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Find me one piece of evidence that indicates the Israelis are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; responsible for Sept 11, and I will retract my opinion about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ridiculous Islamic tabloid known as Al-Jazeera.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Your opinion based on one set of editorials is irrelevant. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Whether there is evidence of Israeli involvement or not is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the issue.  You are advocating blaming a particular publication
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and shutting it down although it is not remotely any of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;business to do any such thing and such attitudes and acting on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them are part of what pisses many off toward the US.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
They broadcast numerous lies concerning the Israelis and the World
<br>
Trade Center. They are an Islamic tabloid, nothing else.
<br>
<p>You refuse to consider the fact that those who spread outright
<br>
falsehoods or half-truths are part of the problem.
<br>
<p>I don't care if they exist or not, I just know better than to
<br>
consider them anything other than a source of propaganda.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You may not have seen anything that convinces you, but I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; convinced long ago.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Then present your evidence if you would.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I've already explained I'm not interested in making a legal case,
<br>
I'm interested in finishing these people off.
<br>
<p>If your interested in pursuing a legal angle you might want to
<br>
start with those who tried the first time destroying the World
<br>
Trade Center. They we're scheduled to be sentenced the day after
<br>
the attack occurred.
<br>
<p>They are known Bin Laden associates. Enough for me.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; If I was to become a terrorist you would never find sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evidence to convict me in any court.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;But that is hardly an argument that you did or did not commit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any act is it?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Of course not, But I could stand there and say &quot;prove it&quot; and you
<br>
never would be able to.
<br>
<p>Sound familiar?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;To what end?  What are your objectives?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Destroy Bin Laden/Al-Quaeda, destroy their Taliban
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; supporters/allies, re-establish a viable government (democratic)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for the people of Afghanistan, get out and go home.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;OK.  That is at least much more modest than what Bush and co.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are proposing.  Getting bin Laden and changing the Afghani
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government are only the beginning for them.  On what basis will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you destroy the Taliban rather than simply deposing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government?  I don't see any righteous basis for us fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destroying them.  
</em><br>
<p>The Taliban allowed Bin Laden to have his terrorist bases there,
<br>
they are in complicity with Al-Quaeda, and will now share their
<br>
fate.
<br>
<p>Surrendering is their only hope.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why is crushing Kandahar a big objective?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Taliban stronghold, see above.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;OK. But I don't understand your above goal.
</em><br>
<p>The Taliban are in cahoots with Al-Quaeda, they are equally guilty
<br>
in our eyes for the attack on New York.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Destroying the Taliban utterly would cause a lot of innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suffering also.  As the Al-Qaeda is supposed to span multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries destroying it would not end at Afghanistan either.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where else would you see us march in for a military action?
</em><br>
<p>You'll have to explain to me how destroying the Taliban would cause
<br>
innocent suffering.
<br>
<p>We will pursue Al-Qaeda wherever they exist, countries that have
<br>
terrorist bases (Sudan) may face military action. But I think the
<br>
current plan is to use agents in other places.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Dunno.  Doesn't it already exist in Egypt and Jordan or some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the countries in the area that are largely Muslim?  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;admittedly ignorant here.  I think there might be a real swing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away from theocratic state in Afghanistan after their experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;under the Taliban.  
</em><br>
<p>I'm mostly just interested in all the people of Afghanistan having
<br>
a say in their own lives. I want them to have everything we have,
<br>
and I think that democracy and a free market system are the best
<br>
answer.
<br>
<p>The Taliban are entropic.
