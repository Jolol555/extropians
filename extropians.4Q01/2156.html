I believe the Greenspan economy, which was based on the then, West German 
<br>
economic idea of fighting inflation first was what highlighted the 1990's 
<br>
economic boom. Greenspan was confident, as his German intellectual forebears, 
<br>
that if one fights inflation and thus, refuses to permit the normal economic 
<br>
cycle to close, one can have sustained growth.
<br>
<p>Caveat: One clearly cannot do this during a fuel price game by OPEC, or a 
<br>
national emergency, like we are experiencing with this Islamist War. So, in 
<br>
fact, the hurd instinct which rules the stock market, affected it weakest 
<br>
link, the dot.coms, last year. My repeated suggestions for placing energy 
<br>
security first, is also a way of tamping down on OPEC oil shennanigans, and 
<br>
liberating ourselves from their greed and stupidity. 
<br>
<p>This may have a salutory psychological effect on its own, in knowing that 
<br>
America's energy-economic future is on a firmer footing.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Is there any &quot;real&quot; evidence that the Fed is completely to blame here?
<br>
Could there not also be some blame to be shared by the economists who
<br>
were pointing out the tremendous gains in productivity that were
<br>
being attributed to the application of information technologies
<br>
(finally), or to the accumulation of wealth that migrated into
<br>
the hands of VCs who spent it all too often on yet-another
<br>
dot-com business plan, or on the newly minted stock owning
<br>
public who felt they had to play the market at never-before-seen
<br>
P/E ratios or risk losing the lottery?&gt;&gt;
