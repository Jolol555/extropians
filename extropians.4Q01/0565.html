US launches 'anti-terror' satellite
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1582000/1582673.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1582000/1582673.stm</a>
<br>
<p>The satellite can track individuals on the ground
<br>
<p>The United States has launched a satellite which intelligence analysts say
<br>
will probably be used to gather information in the global campaign against
<br>
terrorism.
<br>
The Titan IV rocket was launched from Vandenberg airforce base in California
<br>
on behalf of the US National Reconnaissance Office, a secretive agency
<br>
specialising in providing information for the CIA and the National Security
<br>
Agency.
<br>
<p>The rocket is believed to have been carrying a top secret KH-11 spy
<br>
satellite - that could monitor Afghanistan ahead of an expected military
<br>
strike.
<br>
<p>The US Air Force refused to comment on the payload, but the NRO builds and
<br>
operates America's spy satellites and specialises in gathering pictures and
<br>
electronic data, such as telephone conversations on the ground.
<br>
<p>Pin-point accuracy
<br>
<p>Experts from Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine said the satellite
<br>
was likely to be equipped with a digital camera able to pick out objects as
<br>
small as 10 cm (4 inches) across on the ground.
<br>
<p>Orbiting hundreds of miles above the earth the 15 tonne KH-11 is capable of
<br>
tracking small groups of people walking on the ground as well as vehicle and
<br>
weapons movements.
<br>
<p>It can monitor conversations and even spot campfires at night using infrared
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>Identifying the enemy
<br>
<p>According to Aviation Magazine such information could be used to monitor the
<br>
movements of Taleban groups and refugees to help allied forces separate
<br>
potentially hostile groups from &quot;non-combatants&quot;.
<br>
<p>The United States is believed to have spy satellites over Afghanistan already
<br>
as US forces continue to build up nearby ahead of expected military strikes.
<br>
<p>Before 1996 the NRO did not publicly disclose the launches of its satellites.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
