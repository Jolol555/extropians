<em>&gt; &gt;First of all: I am sure that you're right about the USA, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;think I am right about Germany. But my real question is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unanswered - and I think the answer _is_ important for this list:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Even if the USA can only lower their highest crime rate in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;western world when all their citizens have guns (and I doubt this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because &quot;correlation is not causation&quot;), why do the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;countries have a rate four times lower _without_ this? There must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be other factors than guns, and for me, these are the important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;factors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The way to lower the crime rate is to actually hold criminals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accountable for their own behavior. Something rarely practiced here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the U.S..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It would be a very good thing to clarify that remark quite a
<br>
bit.  We have more people in jail per capita than any other
<br>
country.  We have mandated fixed sentences for many offenses and
<br>
removed the judges ability to consider extenuating
<br>
circumstances.  We have mandated &quot;3 strikes and you're out&quot; in
<br>
some states.  Some 46% of all prisoners are in on (mostly minor)
<br>
drug offenses.  Roughly 2 million people are now in prison in
<br>
the US.  Perhaps this is not what you consider &quot;accountability&quot;
<br>
but it certainly is a clear sign that something is dangerously
<br>
wrong in this country - dangerous to all of us.  Also please pay
<br>
a lot of attention to cleaning up what is a &quot;criminal&quot; by the
<br>
current often asinine laws and what is rationally a &quot;criminal&quot;. 
<br>
Quite different things. 
<br>
<p>Our disasterous &quot;war on drugs&quot; has also brought quite a bit of
<br>
violence and higher levels of organized crime to our culture
<br>
just like the first Prohibition did.  Only the faces and form
<br>
has changed.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But don't take my word, look for yourself:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://12.17.79.6/ctznicam/ctznicam.asp">http://12.17.79.6/ctznicam/ctznicam.asp</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Firearms empower to what? To kill. I can't find this extropian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Like the proverb says: For some one with only a hammer, everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;looks like a nail. Someone who has a gun has no need to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;about better alternatives. Cf. the discussion about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;no-alternatives situations...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is ridiculous and totally unsupportable. There are 80 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; armed Americans who find other solutions every day. Guns are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapon of last resort, but one you're damn glad to have when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  When I bought a gun I became much more responsible and
<br>
thoughtful about my reactions and attitudes, not less so.  I
<br>
hear this is a pretty common reaction.
