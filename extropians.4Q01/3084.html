<p>
Frederick posted a useful commentary with some references
<br>
regarding the tendency people have to warp external reality
<br>
to bring it into agreement with their internal reality.
<br>
<p>Then posted a link to the &quot;I AM A MURDERER&quot; page, which I'm
<br>
not going to include becase Frederick also should have included
<br>
a &quot;not to be clicked on by the squemish&quot; warning!
<br>
<p>I question why he feels it focuses on the issue of &quot;denial&quot;.
<br>
The entire discussion there is based on accepting a belief system
<br>
(Christianity) and attributing &quot;words&quot; to &quot;God&quot; for which there is
<br>
little concrete evidence.  The page is about a contrived denial of
<br>
a system of beliefs which is itself based on denial (because of an
<br>
underlying assumption that &quot;miracles&quot; are &quot;real&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (My suggested solution to the &quot;abortion dilemma&quot; is to develop the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology to remove a fetus from a mother's womb and have it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive and grow in another woman's womb or in a &quot;mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; womb.&quot; But this isn't really relevant to my current enquiry.)
</em><br>
<p>Agreed (about it not being relevant).  However, from a scientific
<br>
standpoint one should recognize that the development from a
<br>
blastocyst into an embryo into a fetus into an infant is a
<br>
fairly &quot;continuous&quot; process.  Losing the information content
<br>
contained in that process becomes increasing undesirable the
<br>
later it occurs.  However, even infanticide could under some
<br>
circumstances be an acceptable form of triage
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(see: <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=triage">http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=triage</a>)
<br>
such as when a mother may seek to maintain sufficient bodily
<br>
resources to feed an older infant.
<br>
<p>In considering the information loss associated with an abortion,
<br>
one may wish to balance that against the information loss that
<br>
occurs with the incarceration of 28% of the black and 16% of the
<br>
hispanic men in the U.S. at some point in their lives [SciAm,
<br>
Dec 01, pg 28, DOJ estimates].  There is a loss of tax dollars that
<br>
could be devoted to more productive purposes, a loss of security
<br>
due to people committing the crimes that put them in jail, loss
<br>
of productive lives that evidence suggests are more likely to
<br>
result *if* the children are &quot;wanted&quot; by the parents, etc.).
<br>
<p>Rather than allocate research dollars to preserving information
<br>
which may only contribute to greater information loss in the
<br>
future (given the current foster care system in the U.S. which
<br>
tends to produce criminals in some situations) -- it would seem to
<br>
be a better idea to (a) produce birth control methods for males and
<br>
females that are reliable to 99.9999999% of their uses and
<br>
allow individuals to utilize them *before* they become sexually
<br>
active; (b) develop methods for putting fetuses into biostasis
<br>
*until* such time as statistics suggest that it is highly likely
<br>
such individuals can mature in an environment that does not foster
<br>
the development of criminals.
<br>
<p>One might even go so far in a really extropic society as to prevent
<br>
the possibility of reproduction until one has been sufficiently
<br>
educated that one has a moderately successful chance of raising
<br>
contributing members of society.  The idea of allowing people to
<br>
drive other peoples lives before having demonstrated an ability
<br>
to successfully drive their own makes very little sense to me.
<br>
Of course this raises the question of whether humans have a
<br>
fundamental right to create really screwed up lives for other
<br>
humans.
