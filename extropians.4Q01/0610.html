From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Nothing%20beats%20science%20(was:%20This%20war%20is%20not%20about%20terror...)&In-Reply-To=&lt;09e901c150cb$b111c700$ab5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Science is a formalized tool that reflects a greater whole - for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the experimental method reflects (among other things) the Bayesian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probability Theorem.  I don't need magic to know whether or not I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy.  There's a certain subjective sensation I call happiness, and it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not exactly hard to tell whether it's present, and at what intensity, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why.
</em><br>
<p>In addition, since happiness correlates to serotonin and other neuromodulator
<br>
hormone levels, it can be measured scientifically. Other emotions correspond
<br>
to brain activity in specific regions. For example, love is coincident with
<br>
activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, middle insula, putamen, and caudate
<br>
nucleus. Consequently science can determine if one is in love by measuring the
<br>
intensity of activity in these regions.
<br>
See:
<br>
<a href="http://www4.cnn.com/2000/HEALTH/11/08/love.in.lights.ap/index.html">http://www4.cnn.com/2000/HEALTH/11/08/love.in.lights.ap/index.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question I ask myself ultimately reflects a physical fact about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my brain-state, and an external observer who wanted a definite answer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the question could find one.  If I were confused about the definition, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external observer could discover everything there was to know about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusion.
</em><br>
<p>I think that explains the process sufficiently to give credit to science in
<br>
your example. Also, aesthetic values can be quantified and measured
<br>
computationally, given the elements which comprise such values as beauty and
<br>
attractiveness (as these values derive from symetry and balance, etc.).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not everything involves controlled experimental studies, but that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because controlled experimental studies aren't always necessary to find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple answers to routine questions.  It doesn't mean that there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something outside of science.  I don't use a scientific methodology to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine whether I'm happy for the same reason I don't use a scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methodology to determine where I left my wristwatch; it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overkill.  It doesn't mean that the location of my wristwatch is a deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth that science can never comprehend.
</em><br>
<p>In further support of your comments, I'd add that since intelligence impels
<br>
scientific methodology, intelligence may also decide when such methodology is
<br>
not necessary to solve lesser problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Asking an ambiguous or observer-dependent question does not mean that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying reality is uncertain or subjective.  It doesn't even mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the question is outside of science.  If science can precisely describe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambiguity or the observer-dependency, science can combine that description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the description of reality to yield the best available answer to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<p>Even if the underlying reality is uncertain or subjective, that does not
<br>
prevent science providing an objective analysis linked to a grid of known
<br>
facts. Scientific methods can fill in knowledge gaps by testing overall
<br>
systems. Once a correlation is established, it can be tested to see if
<br>
exceptions occur, which would falsify the answer under consideration. So,
<br>
science beats every alternative methodology because only science can
<br>
ultimately verify solutions derived by intuitive or serendipitous methods.
<br>
<p>Nothing beats science...
<br>
What a great slogan! Would make a nice bumper sticker.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
