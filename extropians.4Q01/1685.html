<em>&gt; So if the brain has built in hardware for creating these feelings, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to produce religion in societies (and we can see why epileptic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;prophets&quot; in olden times would be exactly the people expected to write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff like the Bible and other religious documents), it must have evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a reason. People with this hardware are more likely to survive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce. Societies of these people are more likely to outcompete other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups of people who don't have it. Perhaps it allows these groups of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to &quot;stop worrying&quot; and get on with work that might help them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive? Or is religion just a fluke- the brain hardware only seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate feelings of deep meaning and &quot;joy&quot;, perhaps feeling attached
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to your surroundings and people helped those people and societies do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, and later on those feelings got interpreted by individuals to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be significant- boom, you get religions.
</em><br>
<p>What seems to me the most apparent evolutionary benefit of a sense of
<br>
ethics and/or religious belief is that is provides a shortcut to
<br>
reasoning about long-term interests over short-term ones.  It takes
<br>
relatively simple hardware to reason that if you steal a piece of
<br>
fruit you won't be hungry.  But it takes more effort to reason that
<br>
if you steal it, the person you stole it from will be angry and his
<br>
anger will reduce your fitness.  If instead you have the ability to
<br>
&quot;feel bad&quot; about theft, you are motivated to follow your long-term
<br>
interests in conflict with immediate goals.  Likewise for feelings
<br>
of love/attachment, religious ritual, etc.
<br>
<p>(Now, the ability to have those same &quot;theft is bad&quot; feelings about
<br>
growing your own fruit on your own land after your neighbor
<br>
discovered how seems like it would require some indoctrination
<br>
beyond what is hard wired :-)
