<p>Yes, and it is not just an issue of naming. But the tools useful to
<br>
track down one group are useful to track down the other. So when
<br>
applauding a technology good for catching the terrorists we should
<br>
remember that it can (and likely will) be used by repressive regimes to
<br>
catch dissidents too.
<br>
<p>#### I would argue that technologies improving human ability to gain
<br>
information should be, on average, more extropic than entropic, compared to
<br>
methods of obfuscation and concealment.
<br>
<p>It's true that such truth-revealing technologies can give more power to the
<br>
evil ones but they are even more important for individuals and groups who
<br>
abide by moral rules. The key to being a successfull criminal is the
<br>
concealment of your true nature. The key to being a successfull tyrant is
<br>
depriving your subjects of access to information. 
<br>
<p>The technology giving a tyrant full access to everyone's thoughts might make
<br>
that tyrant less vulnerable to internal threats. He could use his forces
<br>
efficiently to target his most powerful opponents. Yet, being a tyrant, and
<br>
therefore by definition acting against the wishes of his subjects, he would
<br>
be building an internallly weak society, based on intimidation and
<br>
deception.
<br>
<p>A society which respects life, truth, and freedom should be inherently more
<br>
efficient than a tyranny (at least as long as the members of that society
<br>
are interested in their own survival) and full knowledge would boost the
<br>
efficiency (in science, business, weapons production). This society should
<br>
be able to win any confrontation with a tyranny. The end result might
<br>
hopefully be the elimination of morally imperfect societies.
