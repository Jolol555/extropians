</em><br>
<p>Those might be views that a relativist would hold, but not inherently
<br>
linked to relativism. Cultural relativism is the belief that no way of
<br>
life, language, body of folk traditions, religion, cuisine, choice of
<br>
fashion, etc. is inherently superior to any other. This, tempered by
<br>
common sense (e.g. let's draw the line at cannibalism and slavery) is
<br>
eminently compatible with Western democractic, libertarian culture.
<br>
<p>The opposite of relativism would be extreme chauvinism including the
<br>
&quot;America love it or leave it&quot; variety as well as the &quot;Death to
<br>
infidels&quot; variety.
<br>
<p>Unsurprisingly relativism is highly vulnerable to missense mutations
<br>
like the one I'll call absolute relativism.
<br>
<p>Absolute relativism is the belief that not only is everybody free to
<br>
believe what they want, not only that you are *potentially* as
<br>
mistaken as everybody else, but that everybody else is *actually* as
<br>
right as you are. Where a normal relativist says &quot;I believe 'A' but I
<br>
could be swayed toward 'B' if somebody can prove to me that 'B' is
<br>
more consistant with my other memes than 'A'&quot; an absolute relativist
<br>
says &quot;'A' and 'B' (and all other memes everywhere) have exactly the
<br>
same truth value&quot;. This creates all kinds of interesting dilemmas,
<br>
like mutually exclusive statements being equally right, or relativism
<br>
itself being on an equal footing with absolutism.
<br>
<p>If absolute relativists (and their less sophisticated flag-burning
<br>
cousins the leftilists) had paid more attention in philosophy class,
<br>
they would realize that this is a solved problem. The answer is
<br>
existentialism. If existentialism proves too convoluted (which it well
<br>
may, since hardly anybody except me will ever give you a straight
<br>
answer as to what the hell it even IS) I refer the world to the
<br>
streamlined and enhanced Existentialism
<br>
Pro. <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=697549">http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=697549</a>
<br>
<p>However, I don't believe that Samantha is an absolute relativist,
<br>
because if she was, it would be impossible for her to disagree with
<br>
you or anybody else. I also don't believe her assertion that she is
<br>
not a relativist at all, since some degree of relativism is pretty
<br>
much a prerequisite for being a rational, modern individual.

* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
<br>

<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
<br>
* and its Jihad.&quot;                                                   *
