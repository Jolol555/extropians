<p><p>I once got into an argument with some religious people about the very same
<br>
thing.  I didn't realize it was a common idea.  It wasn't a very fruitful
<br>
argument, as they didn't believe the Myth of the Zero Cost Transaction was
<br>
relevant in a religious context.  When pushed, it essentially boiled down to
<br>
a &quot;god will provide&quot; argument.  They've resigned themselves to never being
<br>
wealthy and they don't even realize it.
<br>

<em>&gt; One would have to develop a totally different model of development
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can think of would be something like a credit union or a co-op
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where everyone participating would pay in a certain monthly amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and have access to a certain amount of capital.
</em><br>
<p><p>IIRC, when similar religious laws were tried in parts of Europe at various
<br>
points in time, I believe the business community created fee structures for
<br>
the various services associated with the interest free loan so that profit
<br>
could be made.  No loan was given that didn¹t include a (highly over-priced)
<br>
service contract of some type.  At least in Europe, as I understand it, they
<br>
were able to work around the religious laws by contriving services that
<br>
required fees, which was considered acceptable by the church.  The islamic
<br>
world may have a stricter implementation that does not look favorably on
<br>
cost recovery through contrived contracts, making violations of the law in
<br>
spirit more difficult.
