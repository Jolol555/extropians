<p>Habib Kaseem.  When I was at the University of Central Florida in
<br>
1979, we had a number of students from Iran.  When the shah was
<br>
overthrown, they got word from their well-to-do families to stay put
<br>
in America and study.  In general the Iranian students didn't like to
<br>
study.  They were the partyingest bunch of guys you ever saw.  So
<br>
when it came time for the test, they would hire ringers.  Since one
<br>
had to show a photo ID to get into the tests, they needed someone
<br>
who looked like the employer's photo, so they would hire Habib
<br>
Kaseem, who was Iranian and smart as a whip.  Always produce
<br>
an A on any engineering exam.
<br>
<p>Habib was a friend of me.  He would crack me up, his view of life,
<br>
his countrymen, they had no problem ethically with what they were
<br>
doing, never lost a wink of sleep over it.  They would observe
<br>
Ramadan to the point of not even drinking water while the sun
<br>
was up, yet hire Habib Kaseem to test for them.  spike
