<p>By the way, did you read the link I posted? As an individual obviously
<br>
concerned with human rights, and perceptive enough to see past the
<br>
black-and-white view both the Islamic fundies and the Bush would like
<br>
you to see, I figured you'd find it particularly relevant.

<p>Good point. If you can furnish me a reference to a statement by a

Wahhabi cleric condemning the terrorist attacks of 9/11, I will

rephrase my sig and post a retraction.

<p><em>&gt; Muslims are required to assure you or that they should be worried about

</em><br>
<p>I specifically don't think Muslims or anybody else is required to
<br>
assure anybody of anything. However, the Muslim community appears to
<br>
be concerned about how it looks to the rest of the world and
<br>
understandably anxious to distance itself from terrorism. But the
<br>
statements I've seen from Muslim leaders (until recently) shy away
<br>
from an unqualified condemnation of those responsible for the 9/11
<br>
atrocity. Would it kill them to just condemn it and leave it at that
<br>
without using it as a platform to disseminate their views on Iraq and
<br>
Israel? Yes, Israelis are oppressing Palestinians and I'd vote to stop
<br>
them if I had the opportunity. Yes, we need to find a way to contain
<br>
or remove Hussein without harming civilians the way our current
<br>
sanctions are.  But attaching these issues as a rider to 9/11...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. ...rewards the perpetrators by promoting their stated agenda.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. ...diminishes the horror and senselessness of 6000 people being
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;murdered.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. ...is a petty, self-serving, and transparent stance that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calls into question the sincerity of the supposed moderates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that make such statements.
