<p><em>&gt;In any case, there are obviously plenty of great artists who aren't
</em><br>
depressive in any way. So depression doesn't seem to be necessary for
<br>
art. Maybe it helps by providing wrenching dark hues to the composition.&lt;
<br>
<p>I was surprised reading a comment that &quot;struggling&quot; and &quot;artist&quot; have some sort of mutually exclusive relationship. -:) The mythic silliness that started this rumor has been put to rest, at least in our community by the Transhumanist Art Statement and, later, the Extropic Art Manifesto.
<br>
<p>This is also the sentiment in other culturally intelligent communities.  It's only the romantically inclined that needs to find some poetic sentiment in the poor unhappy artist tittle-tattle. I have no sympathy for an artist who needs to suffer for his work.  I relish with great compassion an artist who overcomes odds in his work.
<br>
<p>Please, let's not return the old-world romantic notion that artists, or any creative person, needs to struggle to be expressive.  Hog Wash!
