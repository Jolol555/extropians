<p>Sentience, from my perspective, is based primarily on my ability

to be aware of myself, to have perceptions, understand that I am
<br>
having perceptions and to be able to imagine myself having perceptions,
<br>
taking actions, etc.  So long as a pattern of atoms is able to achieve
<br>
those same capacities it doesn't matter how it is implemented.  My perceptual
<br>
abilities do not scale down to the level of knowing when specific neurons fire.
<br>
So long as the perceptions that result from those neurons firing are
<br>
identical, I don't care whether it is wet neurons or dry cellular automata
<br>
that are producing them.

<p>As soon as its experiences diverge from yours it is a unique individual.
<br>
However, *you* diverged from yourself as soon as the copying process
<br>
was completed.  So one can argue that there are *two* unique copies,
<br>
derived from the &quot;original&quot;.  They have an overlapping shared history
<br>
that started diverging the minute the &quot;fork&quot; caused by the copying
<br>
occurred.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To me, this argument is pretty sound, if someone feels otherwise, please
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>As I pointed out at Extro3, the only way to achieve subjective immortality
<br>
is distributed replicated intelligence.  Single entities will always be
<br>
subject to accidental failures.  Let us say that copying can only be
<br>
done by destructive readout, but in so doing, 4 precisely identical &quot;copies&quot;
<br>
(at the sentience/perceptual/consciousness levels) are created and
<br>
positioned equidistant from each other 35 AU from the Sun (between Neptune
<br>
and Pluto).  Sensory inputs and the virtual worlds the copies inhabit
<br>
are carefully structured so as to remain synchronized with each other.
<br>
This is one way to achieve subjective immortality.
<br>
<p>Alternatively one could evolve oneself such that there is only 1/4 of
<br>
your mind at each location.  Then losing one part (due to a comet,
<br>
asteroid, etc.) is like losing an arm or a leg.  Painful but survivable.
<br>
One can obviously partion oneself across even larger distances and use greater
<br>
numbers of &quot;hardware instances&quot; that support smaller fractions of ones mind.
<br>
This is another way to achieve subjective immortality.
<br>
<p>Any strategy that is based on retaining ones mind in hardware not engineered
<br>
for distributed repliction is, I believe, doomed to be mortal.
