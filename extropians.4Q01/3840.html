Dr. Jerry Lemler(CEO of Alcor) has shared with the world on Cryonet:
<br>
The highlight of my week, however, was the announcement of my daughter
<br>
Jessica's engagement to Mr. James Sikes. James is attending a local
<br>
university, and has been working part time at Alcor, helping Hugh and Mathew with various
<br>
projects. Everyone here (including myself) thinks quite highly of James.
<br>
He's a likeable fellow from Louisiana, who has earned our good will and respect with
<br>
his steady hand and easy affability, tempered with a maturity well beyond his
<br>
years. I'm not sure who's getting the better of the bargain here-- they're
<br>
both great kids!
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I just wanted to publicly congratulate Jessica Lemler and James Sikes on 
<br>
their engagement!  This is very exciting news.  You never know what 
<br>
developments can result from moving a family to a new place.  And to think 
<br>
Dr. Lemler might have thought by moving  to Arizona he would not have to 
<br>
worry about having a southerner as a son in law. lol!  James is very 
<br>
fortunate to have a fiancee whose father thinks the world of him.
<br>
<p>very best wishes to the couple,
<br>
<p>John
