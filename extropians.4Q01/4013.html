<p>
I just read Nick Bostrom's article:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/classic.html">http://www.simulation-argument.com/classic.html</a>
<br>
<p>Not being a physicist or mathematician I feel a bit apprehensive about
<br>
commenting on it, lest I say something embarrassing, but let me try to
<br>
explain how I could try to disagree with the article's conclusion:
<br>
<p>1) Let's assume that the whole of reality is a mathematical construct - a
<br>
self-evolving formal system, not constrained by the laws of physics (such as
<br>
conservation laws), whose infinitesimally small subset is our observable
<br>
physical world, with it's laws ultimately derived from a set of axioms and
<br>
rules of production. No entity external to the totality of this system
<br>
exists, hence it is not a simulation, but rather an explosion of pure
<br>
mathematics, arising spontaneously and unavoidably from a true and absolute
<br>
nothingness, in all the unimaginable ways pure math could develop, with new
<br>
extensions of the axiom set adding themselves whenever undecidable theorems
<br>
arise. 
<br>
<p>2) We cannot place ourselves with absolute certainty within any level of the
<br>
system - there is an unknown and perhaps unknowable number of layers
<br>
separating our physical reality from the mathematical constructs which we
<br>
are capable of understanding (contain within our minds), such as the roots
<br>
of number theory, and the empty set.
<br>
<p>3) Since the number of levels of the system (its axiomatic extensions) is as
<br>
large as mathematics itself, infinite in a way beyond the reach of our
<br>
minds, it follows that subsets of the system capable of supporting our
<br>
physics should arise in an infinity of levels, over and above any of the
<br>
branching patterns predicted by the multiuniverse interpretation of QM. It
<br>
is somewhat similar to the infinite formation of patterns in a fractal, such
<br>
as the Mandelbrot set, where the central black rosette comes up over and
<br>
over again, arbitrarily large or infinitesimally smaller than the first
<br>
instance you calculate, except the whole system is not fractal - new
<br>
extensions are not blowups of lower levels, although they do contain
<br>
repetitions of the smaller sets as their constituent parts.
<br>
<p>4) Some of the instances of worlds indistinguishable from ours will occur
<br>
within computational devices used by sentient entities living on higher
<br>
levels, farther removed from the root of the system. Let's call them S
<br>
<p>5) Some of the instances of worlds indistinguishable from ours will occur as
<br>
subsets of branches of mathematics per se, like fractals, without any
<br>
conscious entities producing them. Let's call them N.
<br>
<p>6) Both N and S are infinities, and if most of the system consists of
<br>
branches which are not sentient, then N&gt;&gt;S.
<br>
<p>7) If N&gt;&gt;S, then it is indeed possible that a vast majority of
<br>
instantiations of our minds would exist without being simulated, while
<br>
allowing a high likelihood of developing into posthumans, infinitely large
<br>
numbers of whom would run ancestor simulations (e.g. as part of applied
<br>
cosmology experiments, without any moral motivations). 
<br>
<p>So this is the fourth proposition. Metaphysics at it's worst, I'm afraid,
<br>
probably unprovable and unfalsifiable, but pleasant. 
<br>
