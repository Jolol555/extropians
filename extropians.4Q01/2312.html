Robert J. Bradbury, Thu Nov 08, 2001:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To be balanced about this we would need to know perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what the educational level of her neighbor is and why and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how he left Egypt. Presumably we have some kind of selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect (not dissimilar to that which almost all Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have previously been subjected to) that foreign immigrants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were dissatisfied with the situation in their home land and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were smart enough to seek better opportunities elsewhere.
</em><br>
<p>No, this isn't an appropriate forum for that kind of personal
<br>
information. You would have to trust that I took some time (alot) and
<br>
care in finding a person who I consider a good &quot;bridge&quot; between two
<br>
different worlds, and no he's not an immigrant. Anyone here can just
<br>
as easily do the same to look into reported &quot;facts&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So the opinions on which Amara is challenging the Tiger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;position should be looked at in context. 
</em><br>
<p>Since it was the writer making the assertions in that article, I would
<br>
consider it the writer's responsibility to provide proof for his
<br>
assertions. From his writing that I read, he didn't appear to spend
<br>
time in the place that he was writing about.
<br>
<p>I would urge people to spend time investigating on their own,
<br>
including spending time talking to people or travelling to the
<br>
location, or at the very least, to spend time in a library, where the
<br>
information is alot more balanced. Don't base all your information on
<br>
Web or newspaper articles.
<br>
