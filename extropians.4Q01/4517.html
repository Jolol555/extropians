<em>&gt; He was a great lover of literature, philosophy, and classical music, and I

will dearly miss the time I spent trying to help him understand the meaning of
<br>
the advancement of science and technology.
<br>
<p>Ken -- It saddens me to hear that your father has recently died. At times of
<br>
such loss we often feel that there must be something we can do to assuage the
<br>
sorrow, and we try to comfort each other to lessen the sadness. I don't know
<br>
if you are familiar with any zen teachings about the benefits of
<br>
desirelessness, but though our grief may cause us to imagine that science and
<br>
technology may somehow conquer death, and though it may seem insensitive to
<br>
speak of science in the same paragraph with bereavement, nevertheless I think
<br>
you can grasp the truth that birth and death are the two opposite poles of a
<br>
single process called life.
<br>
<p>&quot;It seems to me that I have been but as a child upon a beach running from one
<br>
brightly coloured pebble to another whilst the great ocean of truth lay
<br>
stretched out before me.&quot;
<br>
--Isaac Newton (last words )

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
