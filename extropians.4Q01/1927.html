<p><em>&gt; So why trust it with ever more power?
</em><br>
<p>Because it would appear that increasing our own morality
<br>
(or freedom) in a world where others lack such morality
<br>
(or freedom) recently killed 5000 people.
<br>
<p>History clearly shows how we have botched the job (forgetting
<br>
about Afghanistan as soon as the Soviets pulled out and focusing
<br>
instead on Iraq).  So I'm pessimistic that *anything* we do now
<br>
will turn out well.  However living in a democratic society
<br>
you have to realize the fate of politicians who argue that
<br>
we should take the hit on withdrawal from our oil addiction.
<br>
Its political suicide.  The bottom line is that one can only
<br>
&quot;manage&quot; the disaster as best you can and hope technology will
<br>
dig us out of our hole before it all goes to hell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does anyone seriously think it will not abuse these new powers?
</em><br>
<p>No, a better question is, will such abuses extend the
<br>
longevity of the average law-abiding citizen?
<br>
<p>We are holding ~1000 people now on various minor charges associated
<br>
with the WTC attacks.  Most of those people, I would believe, are not
<br>
citizens (or perhaps recent citizens, perhaps here under false
<br>
pretenses).  At least some of those individuals are taking the 5th
<br>
and refusing to talk.  While I'm not an expert on any
<br>
possible side effects of drugs inducing individuals to
<br>
be more cooperative, it seems likely that they are less
<br>
damaging than the torture that arrested suspects endure in most
<br>
countries.  I am not opposed to the use of will-diminishing
<br>
non-violent methods in cases where there is reasonable evidence
<br>
that such individuals intend to use their resources or knowledge
<br>
to conduct &quot;acts&quot; of war (i.e. where they may be willing to sacrifice
<br>
themselves to kill or harm a large number of non-involved parties).
<br>
Knowledge that such methods might be used would prompt terrorists
<br>
to provide their agents with suicide pills in the event the police
<br>
show up at their door.  From my perspective allowing them to exit
<br>
stage left of their own free will could be the best solution for
<br>
everyone.
<br>
<p>This article, that was previously posted warrants reading

<br>
<p>Bottom line -- dead people don't care about their privacy *or*
<br>
their freedom.
