<p>*g* My feeling is irrational, correct, but it is not irrelevant, because it 
<br>
has great influence on my actions. We all act more on feelings than on 
<br>
rational thinking - although we are good in finding rational justifications 
<br>
for our feelings.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- People buy guns because they feel unsafe, even if statistics show that 
<br>
most of them will never be victims of a violent crime - &quot;just in case...&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;- People believe in religions because they feel alone without and 
<br>
&quot;empowered&quot; with it, even if history provides no proven evidence for their 
<br>
beliefs - &quot;just in case...&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;- People believe in cryonics and such because they fear to die, even if 
<br>
there's no evidence that they can reawake with their mind undamaged - &quot;just 
<br>
in case...&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;- People believe in transhumanism to find comfort in the fiction of a 
<br>
better tomorrow, even if there is no rational basis for their theories - 
<br>
&quot;just in case...&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;- etc.
<br>
<p>Individual acting is mostly based on feelings. Buying decisisons are based 
<br>
on feelings. Stock trading is based on feelings. Elections are based on 
<br>
feelings. Politicians act on feelings. Scientists are motivated by 
<br>
feelings. We better take feelings into account, make them measurable and 
<br>
visible, when we talk about the future. Hey, you don't feel scared about 
<br>
feelings, do you? :-)
