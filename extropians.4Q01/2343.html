It just occurred to me that Extro-6 is planned to be only two months before the ALCOR Conference, which will be in December of 2002.  At least for some people, this could be a problem.  I know for me it will be, since due to the distances involved, and finances, I will only be able to attend one conference.  Deciding which one will be very hard for me.  
<br>
<p>One possibility is to actually reschedule Extro-6 to be a two weekend's in a row double-feature with the ALCOR conference!  I could find a way to manage that.  And think of the synergistic energy created by such a cross-pollination of ideas and people.  
<br>
<p>Trying to decide which conference to attend could cause me to have a nervous breakdown.  lol  I might have to become a itinerant cryonicist(play Kung-Fu theme music in background).
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
