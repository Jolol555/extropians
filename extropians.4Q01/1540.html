Alex forwards:

<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-602.html#lnk5">http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-602.html#lnk5</a>
</em><br>
<p>I have a few problems with this.  I see some bias and selectivity
<br>
in the analysis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What this means is not just that the RIAA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is applying makeup to the corpse of the music industry as we've known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. In fact, it heralds an even larger change about how all content is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created and distributed, and raises serious questions as to whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content creators (such as the author of this essay) will ever be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compensated for our work.
</em><br>
<p>It's not at all clear how the current content wars will play out.  It's a
<br>
battle and the front lines shift back and forth.   There are persistent
<br>
rumors that popular CDs will come out next year that can't be ripped.
<br>
These CDs won't play on computer CD players, only on audio players.
<br>
A few CDs have come out in this format already, as a trial.
<br>
<p>Obviously there will be opposition to such a change by consumers,
<br>
and it will somewhat limit the market for CDs which can be sold in
<br>
this format, but the advantages in making them harder to pirate may
<br>
be motivation enough for the manufacturers.  If this happens, all the
<br>
music on Napster and its replacements will be old stuff, and current
<br>
hits won't be available.
<br>
<p>So it's a little too soon to assume that the music industry as we know
<br>
it is a corpse.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What there may not be is enough revenue to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support the publishers of that content in addition to the authors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which helps explain why the RIAA is so eager to thwart digital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribution. When an ecosystem undergoes severe environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes, certain organisms that were previously essential - like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyanobacteria that originally converted carbon dioxide to oxygen, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the record companies' A&amp;R men - may recede to minor ecological niches.
</em><br>
<p>This blithely assumes that the only negative consequences will be on the
<br>
people everyone loves to hate, the marketers and publishers.  Somehow the
<br>
negative impact on the artists is overlooked here.  It would not suit
<br>
the political purpose of this essay to dwell on reduced revenues to
<br>
the creative people who make music and other content.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Other textbook public goods are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national defense, mosquito control, and public radio.
</em><br>
<p>Why the adjective &quot;public&quot; in public radio?  Is there something about
<br>
public radio which makes it a public good while private radio is not?
<br>
Not that I can see.  Both are non-excludable and non-rival, within a
<br>
certain area.  Why then would the author have mentioned public radio
<br>
while failing to describe ordinary radio and television as public
<br>
goods?  Again I think it is because it wants to lure us into accepting
<br>
a certain model of how to think of this problem.
<br>
<p>The difference between public radio and other radio is that public
<br>
radio is government funded.  Taxes are taken from people who have no
<br>
interest whatsoever in public radio and used to pay for these broadcasts.
<br>
With private radio and TV on the other hand, funding is provided via
<br>
commercials.
<br>
<p>The author does not want us to think that content could be funded by
<br>
commercials.  He wants us to think that it should be funded by government.
<br>
That's my interpretation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;             |  EXCLUDABLE        |  NONEXCLUDABLE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  -----------+--------------------+--------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  RIVAL      |  car, Walkman      |  unmanaged fishing rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  -----------+--------------------+--------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  NONRIVAL   |  movie in a movie  |  lighthouses, national defense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             |  theater, concert  |  mosquito control
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             |  in a large hall   |
</em><br>
<p>Of course another entire category of public goods which has been around
<br>
for centuries is intellectual property: patents, trademarks, copyright.
<br>
Again it is a curious lapse that the author does not mention these,
<br>
and I believe it is because it doesn't fit into the message he is trying
<br>
to send.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If content is becoming a pure public good, it will necessitate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radical rethinking of the recording industry's claim that copying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content is stealing. We as a society react very differently toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpaid use of rival versus nonrival goods. Think of the punishment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inflicted, for example, on those who steal cars versus those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listen to public radio without contributing to the fund drives.
</em><br>
<p>Here we see how smart he was not to mention existing forms of IP.
<br>
Someone who listens to public radio without contributing is at worst
<br>
a leech.  Compare it to someone who steals patented technology, or who
<br>
fraudulently uses someone else's trademark, or republishes a copyrighted
<br>
novel without a license.  Most people will think of these activities
<br>
much less favorably than the guy who doesn't pay PBS.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The lawyers representing the recording and movie industry are well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of the threat to their business models of digital content, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they believe they have already developed the answer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encryption. Encryption represents the music industry's last, best hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of maintaining their product as excludable. Why they are wrong, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content protection is doomed to failure, will have to wait for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next essay.
</em><br>
<p>I will look forward to seeing that.  But so far I am not impressed with
<br>
the evenhandedness of his discussion.
<br>
