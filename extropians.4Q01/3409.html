From: &quot;Samantha Atkins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20&quot;Cloning%20Breakthrough&quot;%20not%20one&In-Reply-To=&lt;029901c1775d$1c417400$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There are two big families of argument here, at least as I see it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (1)'Moratoriumists' believe that we do not have the wisdom at our
</em><br>
current
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stage of cultural development to use Person Engineering Technologies
</em><br>
(PETs),
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but leave open the possibility that in the longer-term this might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethically ok.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have some amount of sympathy for this position.  The amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wisdom we humans apply to any level of technology today is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all impressive.  But I would rather see the technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop, including ones that might be helpful in getting more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual capable humans (and other sentient beings) than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait some indefinite period of time at the current levels and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities - even if this was remotely possible.
</em><br>
I guess most of us here agree. The trick of course is for us to make the
<br>
case compelling for a wider audience. Prima facie, I think the
<br>
Moratoriumist's position might appeal to many secularists as it appears the
<br>
prudent option.
<br>
<em>&gt;  Personally I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think more raw intelligence and computational power alone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be sufficient to arrive at wisdom but that is a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.  The other arguing point against this position is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to pin down exactly how these technologies might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misued.  I can't come up with any very compelling scare cases at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I can't either. Of course the hardest sort of objection is the fear of the
<br>
unknown: what if there is an unknown and deleterious consequence from this
<br>
technology? (What we might think of as the Marie Curie objection). I think
<br>
we will need to have a prepared sort of answer to this sort of objection
<br>
which, as far as I can see, can only be answered by carefully and patiently
<br>
explaining the procedures, benefits, and known risks of this technology.
