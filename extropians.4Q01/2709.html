JR forwards:
<br>
<em>&gt; The 9-year-old programmed the brick-sized robot to remain within the confines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a black oval ring printed on a large sheet of paper. When its light sensor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detects black, the contraption, built of Lego brick and a microcomputer, backs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up, turns around on its four rubber wheels and plays &quot;Fur Elise.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amir's fourth-grade class at Highland Oaks Elementary School in Arcadia is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testing a novel program using robotics in basic science classes. His teacher,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coyla Grumm, said the program teaches more than just scientific concepts; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also addresses problem solving and teamwork. &quot;It's that thinking process,&quot; she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said. &quot;They're choosing what they want to do. They're challenging themselves.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I grew up in Arcadia and although I didn't go to Highland Oaks Elementary,
<br>
I had many friends who did.  The one thing that stands out is that it was
<br>
the school in the richest part of the city.  Arcadia is an upper middle
<br>
class community but it has geographic stratification, with the priciest
<br>
homes in the northern part of the city including many that deserve to
<br>
be called mansions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Arcadia Unified School District's approach is different. The district wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students to build and program robots as part of the basic science curriculum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for elementary and middle school--studying scientific principles by putting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The robots aren't cheap. Equipping the school for the pilot cost more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $29,000. And district officials warn that educators should be wary of useless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products billed as educational that amount to little more than toys.
</em><br>
<p>It is unfortunate but unsurprising that the advantages from this expensive
<br>
pilot program went to the school whose kids already had the greatest
<br>
advantages from their wealthy parents.  No doubt most of those parents
<br>
could easily afford to buy their kids Lego Mindstorms robot kits at home.
<br>
But by getting the school district to do it, the purchase is subsidized
<br>
by the middle class families living in the rest of the city, who receive
<br>
no benefit from the program.
<br>
<p>Having vented, I do think the Mindstorms robots are really cool and
<br>
it is good to see more kids having a chance to play with them.  I just
<br>
hope they give the kids in other schools a turn, maybe rotate the robot
<br>
lab through the schools.  And of course it would be nice if less well
<br>
off cities than Arcadia were able to afford this kind of enrichment.
<br>
If Bill Gates wants to help education he could do worse than to fund
<br>
this kind of program.
