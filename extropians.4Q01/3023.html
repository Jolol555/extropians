<p><em>    &gt; Just because violence has occurred, and further violence may be necessary,

<em>    &gt; is no reason to switch off the cerebral cortex.
</em><br>
<p>That's true of course, nobody is saying we should ignore the cerebral cortex,
<br>
but on the other hand don't turn your nose up at the amygdala, a part of the
<br>
Limbic system of the brain that has to do with fear, there is wisdom there too.
<br>
For the last several hundred million years every one of your ancestors has successfully
<br>
used the fight or flight response to survive. In this case we have no place to flee to so we
<br>
must fight. This algorithm has one advantage even over the scientific method, it is one hell
<br>
of a lot faster. If a man with a bloody ax is coming at you a mediocre solution to the problem
<br>
right now is far better than a perfect solution next month. All the alternatives I've heard to the
<br>
present war are rather vague , all I know is that the recommendations seem to have something
<br>
to do with universal peace love and happiness that would take generations to implement even
<br>
if we knew how to engineer such a utopia. And we don't.
<br>
<p>Forget the long term let me tell you of some of my immediate worries. I worry that smallpox
<br>
will break out in 8 or 9 places in America in the next 90 days. let me make it clear that I think
<br>
this probably will not happen, however I would rate my chances of dying from this disease as
<br>
greater than my chances of getting killed in a airliner but less than my chances of dying in
<br>
a car crash. I also worry about a nuclear explosion in the USA sometime in the next 2 years,
<br>
again it probably will not happen but the consequences if it did are so horrendous that it can
<br>
not be ignored. In retrospect it's clear that we should have started this war 5 or 6 years ago
<br>
and if we continue to let things fester we're dead. By the way, I don't worry much about
<br>
offending religious fanatics because we bomb murderers during some Mickey Mouse
<br>
holy month, I don't think they could hate us much more than they already do.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I am horrified when I hear we need to &quot;look strong&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Do you think peace will be advanced if the only remaining superpower looks weak?
<br>
Power vacuums don't last long, something will fill it, probably something very ugly.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;or that expressing  dissent is a threat to your personal survival which therefore
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;needs to be suppressed.
</em><br>
<p>I hope you weren't referring to me. Everybody has a right to say silly things and I have
<br>
a right to call them an idiot for doing so.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; National honor isn't defended by getting a reputation for an itchy trigger finger;
</em><br>
<p>I don't give a hoot in hell about national honor, but you could not be more correct,
<br>
a superpower with an itchy trigger finger would be a disaster, however a superpower
<br>
with a reputation for an itchy trigger finger is a wonderful thing for world peace.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;&quot;Remove from power those governments aiding terrorists attempting to acquire
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; weapons of mass destruction, even  if it involves harming the captive civilian
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; populations of those governments&quot; sounds to me like a reasonable principle,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; even if it can't be applied consistently because some such governments are
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; too big to be spanked by the present democratic community of nations.  Even if
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; applied inconsistently, this principle still reduces risk.
</em><br>
<p>I tried but I can't find anything to disagree with. Very well said Eliezer!
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I would propose &quot;When somebody is coming at you
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; with a knife, shoot them, but at least *try* and get the formal consent of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the Security Council or even the General Assembly first.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>What's the point, if you don't get formal consent, and you probably will not, are you
<br>
going to just stand there and let them stab you ? We must act no matter what and
<br>
at least this way the UN didn't formally say we can't. Sometimes it's better to
<br>
apologize than to ask permission.
