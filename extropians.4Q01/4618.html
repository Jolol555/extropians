</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who says that the current view is optimal?  In fact, if you position the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar collectors exactly right, you might be able to arrange for nights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the new moon to be graced by a glowing symbol where the circle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blackness used to be.  
</em><br>
<p>I am speaking from the point of view of those who see an intrinsic value
<br>
in the naturally created 'man in the moon' face pattern on the surface
<br>
of the near side. Altering this view would likely create significant
<br>
opposition.
<br>
<p>Up here in NH, we have the state symbol, the &quot;Old Man of the Mountain&quot;
<br>
natural granite rock formation which, when viewed from the north,
<br>
resembles the craggy face of an old man. This formation has long been
<br>
unstable due to spalling and other weather related cracking and shifting
<br>
of the rock, and has been held together for several decades now with
<br>
cable netting anchored into the cliff face. In the 1970's, when the feds
<br>
were trying to route I-93 through the Franconia Notch below the
<br>
formation, the state residents grew worried that the dynamite blasting
<br>
for the roadwork below would shake the formation loose and cause it to
<br>
fall apart, so the road was limited to a single lane in each direction
<br>
for several miles on either side of the notch.
<br>
<p>This sort of 'conservation' has little to do with preserving ecosystems,
<br>
wildlife, etc., it has to do with an innate need in most humans for
<br>
stability in their surroundings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only nights of the new moon, of course; otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it wouldn't look right.  I think the symbol should be a Nike swoosh (so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding won't be a problem).  Once a month, all the people in oppressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries could look up into the night, and know that no matter how long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it takes, no matter how much it costs, someday a McDonalds will rise above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rubble of the palaces of tyrants.  It would be the softly glowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporate logo of hope.
</em><br>
<p>Just don't sell any airtime to CBS.... ;)
