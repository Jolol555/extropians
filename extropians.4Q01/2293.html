<br>
<p>I would also add epistemic relativism: there might exist an objective
<br>
morality, but we can't know with certainty which morality is right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the recent criticism against moral relativity is really against
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalidity is simply a logical contradiction and therefore pointless to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticize on other grounds. Since it itself is a subjective morality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral equivalidity leads to the conclusion that we should treat it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symmetrically with all other moralities which claim moral superiority. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is a logically impossible thing to do, so one could only believe in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes. I think that while moral equivalidity is contradictory, it is also
<br>
more common than moral relativism. If we disregard consistency, instead
<br>
looking at what people actually think and do, it seems that even the
<br>
most vocal moral relativists espousing moral equivalidity (usually based
<br>
on cultural equivalidity) do believe in some kind of overarching,
<br>
universal morality that is objectively true. Not that they would put it
<br>
that way, but when you look at the actual courses of actions suggested
<br>
(such as how minorities should be treated or what to do about female
<br>
circumcision in sub-Saharan Africa) they seldom show moral relativism
<br>
and instead can argue quite passionately for particular courses of
<br>
actions that apparently are universally true (from their perspective).
<br>
So we end up with people espousing moral equivalidity, but with a core
<br>
of some morality which they apply regardless of the equivalidity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many ways to break
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the apparent symmetry between moralities. My personal favorite is to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the indexical fact that I am me, and simply accept my own moral system as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privileged above all others.
</em><br>
<p>This is likely how the above relativists do it.
