</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The krap that I was the target of when I expressed unpopular

</em><br>

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree.  Again, you seem to be reading more than what I am writing.
</em><br>
<p>OK. But I think I was reading what you wrote and responding as I
<br>
did
<br>
because I have seen it used at times to say that even what I
<br>
experienced
<br>
is not something we want to avoid on this list.  I needed
<br>
clarification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am really running out of patience for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over-intellectualizing ignoring of the obvious and the refusal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to say what sort of communication is and is not acceptable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; live by it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Intellectualizing&quot; is what I (and others) do.  Philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters.  It's also important for us to examine ALL the assumptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our culture makes when we are dedicated to overthrowing many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  Certainly some of that culture is useful, but we do have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to examine it carefully to determine that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Playing incessantly with words to the point of sometimes failing
<br>
to decide what ethical
<br>
behavior we will and will not be bound by is imho an abuse of
<br>
intellect.  I have
<br>
no problem with careful examination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What I received and what I have seen others receive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is not acceptable to me.  Some of what I myself have said when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have lost my patience with certain individuals is also not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acceptable to me.  I will not be party to it by doing it myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nor will I excuse, ignore or condone it when others do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds good to me.  The only thing I generally object to is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation of written policies without proper examination.  Personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies, commitments, and judgments are good things: if someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants to killfile me or rebuke me, I won't object.  But written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies can have the effect of limiting the scope of discussion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it's important that those not be taken lightly, or based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purely cultural assumptions like &quot;civility&quot; without examining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what their costs and benefits are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Written policies also form a basis of what we agree on coming in
<br>
the door.  They can form group ground rules. I believe such
<br>
rules (minimal ones)
<br>
are important.  I don't agree that a basic committment to avoid
<br>
ad hominem is purely or significantly (in this context) a
<br>
&quot;cultural assumption&quot;.
<br>
We are a culture of our own.  What will we assume and live by
<br>
dealing with
<br>
one another?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I agree that politeness has considerable benefits.  I completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reject the idea that is has no costs.
</em><br>
<p>The costs of what I advocate in this context are not sufficient
<br>
to
<br>
not practice a reasonable civility with one another.  The cost
<br>
of not practicing
<br>
it are much higher.
