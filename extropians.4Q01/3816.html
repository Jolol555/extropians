The NY Times has an article reprinted on Slashdot at
<br>
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=24463&threshold=2&commentsort=3&mode=flat&cid=2654452">http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=24463&threshold=2&commentsort=3&mode=flat&cid=2654452</a>
<br>
about new directions in understanding the fundamental physics of the
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>Moving away from the classical conception of physics as embodied
<br>
mathematics, with a single equation underlying all physical phenomena,
<br>
the new approach sees the so-called fundamental particles and fields as
<br>
emergent phenomena from an underlying chaos.
<br>
<p>Solid state physics abounds with virtual particle-like objects: phonons,
<br>
which are like particles of sound; holes, which are virtual positively
<br>
charged electrons; magnons, polarons.  Some even have charges of 1/3
<br>
the electron, coincidentally the same as quarks.  Is it possible that
<br>
our conventional particles are just as &quot;quasi&quot; as these abstract ones,
<br>
emerging from some underlying reality that we don't perceive directly?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that this ties in to Stephen Wolfram's upcoming book,
<br>
&quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;, <a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/">http://www.wolframscience.com/</a>, which also
<br>
deemphasizes the use of classical mathematical equations as a method to
<br>
understand the universe, in favor of more complex tools that are built
<br>
out of chaos theory.
<br>
<p>It's exciting to see a possible new paradigm being born for fundamental
<br>
physics.  Even the early work is leading to specific models for universes
<br>
with particles and fields that have some resemblance to our own.  Needless
<br>
to say the string theorists are miffed as up til now they have been the
<br>
only ones who could make such claims.  But string theory has been around
<br>
for quite a while now and has yet to produce our universe.  Maybe this
<br>
new approach, still in its infancy, will hit closer to the mark.
