</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not long ago you were arguing the justifications for the US to

</em><br>

<p>You should not misrepresent other people's statements. I was justifying
<br>
the use of drugs to interrogate uncooperative individuals who we have
<br>
evidence were involved in terrorist groups.
<br>
<p>I have argued that those who, by their actions, have declared themselves
<br>
outside the realm of civilized behavior, who do not declare any status
<br>
as a combatant in some martial arm of a government, strip themselves of
<br>
their human rights under the Geneva Conventions (which I highly
<br>
recommend you actually read before you continue to make a fool of
<br>
yourself). They do not deserve the protections of civilian US Courts.
<br>
They are unlawful combatants, violating the most important of
<br>
international laws. Such people are properly prosecuted in military
<br>
tribunals, as war criminals properly are.
<br>
<p>Apparently, you still have not seen the videotape where bin Laden
<br>
confesses his guilt and that of his organization. If after seeing it,
<br>
you are still not convinced that al Qaeda and the Taliban are the
<br>
epitome of evil and need to be wiped out, then there really is no hope
<br>
for rational discourse with you.
