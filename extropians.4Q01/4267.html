From: &quot;Emlyn O'regan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au?Subject=RE:%20Sincere%20Questions%20on%20Identity&In-Reply-To=&lt;EB5DDEEFC7B4D411AD3B00508BDFF3E202319120@1upmc-msx7.isdip.upmc.edu&gt;">oregan.emlyn@healthsolve.com.au</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>So what I'm saying I guess is that the world of information processing (call
<br>
it I? Maybe I want N or some other such beast from computability), is either
<br>
distinct from or else a strict subset of the physical world (P?). There are
<br>
things that information processing cannot do, which the material world can
<br>
do, and that it the direct manipulation of the material world.
<br>
<p>### What if we say that there is only one essence - which is matter, form,
<br>
movement, space, mind, and algorithm. There is only one, and it is nothing,
<br>
and it is everything.
<br>
<p>OK, this is really New Agey. Really, I am not sooo fuzzy-brained at all.
<br>
<p>Let's try something less fuzzy. 
<br>
<p>Maybe time and consciousness happen as follows - in the beginning there was
<br>
the empty set. It had to be, as it is inconceivable (self-contradictory)
<br>
that it would not exist. The existence of this set implies the existence of
<br>
a set containing the empty set. You can call it &quot;one&quot;. As Claude Shannon
<br>
showed, this leads to 2, 3.... All of number theory inevitably follows.
<br>
<p>Almost all sets can be derived only from other sets. In fact, for any
<br>
collection of sets, there is a much larger collection of sets which can only
<br>
be formed by reference to this initial collection of sets. An infinite
<br>
explosion of sets from other sets, always pointing away from the small and
<br>
simple towards the expanded and more complex, just like time in the whole
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>What if our minds were at the edge of this explosion? If the multiverse QM
<br>
is true, there is a googolplex of future branches exploding from every
<br>
physical object. Maybe every physical object is no more and no less than a
<br>
mathematical set, derived from other sets, ultimately derived from
<br>
emptiness. 
<br>
<p>Our conscious minds, whether biologically implemented or running in a
<br>
simulation, are always at the edge of infinity. Infinity's beginning is our
<br>
past, infinity's newest element is our present, and the rest of infinity has
<br>
not derived itself yet. 
<br>
<p>Our past is a crystalline world of mathematics, which can be brought alive
<br>
again if it is reflected (simulated, implemented) in the present, like a
<br>
calculation of firing neurons. Our future does not exist, but is inevitable,
<br>
just like the derivation of a natural number from its precedent.
<br>
<p>It's still fuzzy. I'm sorry for taking your time.
<br>
