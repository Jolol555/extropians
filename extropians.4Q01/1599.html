</em><br>
<p>That's one of the things that will drive the new marketing
<br>
models for content.  Consumers will pay for ways to find and
<br>
evaluate good content that matches their needs.  If there
<br>
were a download site competing with the one you usually use
<br>
that you found had consistently accurate and useful reviews
<br>
and a good search interface, wouldn't you use it instead,
<br>
even if they had big ads, or charged a nickel per search?
<br>
And if that search-and-evaluate company got big enough to
<br>
have some money to invest, it would be good for them to pay
<br>
artists to create content that matches their demands, even if
<br>
they had no way to make the content exclusive to themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd also dispute the fact that &quot;money doesn't care whose
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth creation capacity of 1 cent in the hands of 200
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million people and $2 million in the hands of a single
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; $2 million in the my hands and $2 million in Madonna's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hands (at least from an extropic perspective).
</em><br>
<p>I agree with the analysis, but I'd pick a better example
<br>
if I were you.  I think Madonna's done a lot to make the
<br>
world a more Extropic place (even if you're not fond of
<br>
the music).
