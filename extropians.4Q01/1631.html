<em>&gt; This is funny: &quot;The Saudi Arabian government is so concerned it is

<em>&gt; This is the same government with a long record of taking Americans into

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Furthermore, the following quote exposes the bias: &quot;More than 800 people

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is known that at least four of the detained suspects have had highly

<p>OK.  Four out of 800?  How many of them are simply innocents
<br>
scooped up?  WIll you treat them all as &quot;prisoners of war&quot; - a
<br>
notion applicable to captured combatants of warring countries
<br>
but not to random sweeps of the &quot;usual suspects&quot;?

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that the author lies about this indicates the bias of the

</em><br>
<p>Wrong!  The author did not lie but quoted the NY Times.  That
<br>
they have bias is certainly not a condemnation relative to the
<br>
bias rampant in almost all the reporting everywhere of
<br>
everything related to this entire mess.  Do you think it is only
<br>
your &quot;objectivity&quot; and supposed lack of bias that allows you to
<br>
toss out whatever confronts your own views as worthless at the
<br>
slightest hint of inconsistency?  It is an old habit but
<br>
actually useless at arriving at a better approximation of the
<br>
truth.
