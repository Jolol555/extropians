<em>&gt; Hmmmm.... Up until recently, more than half of all Americans were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not wealthy enough (or educated enough) to invest in the stock

<em>&gt; market.  Taking the &quot;long view&quot; presumably requires that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance ones resources between real estate, cash, precious metals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *and* stocks (because stocks over the long run have provided the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest return on capital).
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  Taking the long view is always relative to one's circumstances.
<br>
A person who does not have a lot of money might, e.g., just have a savings
<br>
account -- as I have since college.  A person who has a little more might
<br>
invest in other things, such as CDs, money market funds, IRAs, and buying
<br>
other goods (a house, long lasting clothes, etc.) or services (staying in
<br>
good health, education, etc.).  (As in these examples, &quot;property&quot; and
<br>
&quot;capital&quot; should not be collapsed to &quot;land&quot; and &quot;equities.&quot;)
<br>
<p>(People in other times and other societies, too, have a different range of
<br>
choices.  For the farmer in the Third World, the long range could mean just
<br>
plowing the fields for next year and keeping a reserve of seed and food
<br>
against a rainy.  This does not make her or him any less a long range
<br>
planner than someone in the First World saving up a cash reserve in the
<br>
event of being unemployed with the current fad of lay offs.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without various levels of government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with various resources (armies to police forces) whose job it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to protect the &quot;private individual&quot; *how* can one feel &quot;secure&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that one can take the long view?
</em><br>
<p>Rothbard's point is that government on the whole is not better at managing
<br>
property and capital than individuals on their own.  Now, as for protection,
<br>
Rothbard, of course, (and Hoppe) is (are) an anarchocapitalist(s).  So, his
<br>
solution is quite clear.
<br>
<p>However, in the case of a government, do you need more than mere recognition
<br>
and protection of private property to allow individuals to flourish and act
<br>
long range?  Or do you need all the trappings of a welfare state?  My view
<br>
is that the latter clearly acts against human flourishing AND makes people
<br>
think more short range.  Why?  Well, if at any moment some of your property
<br>
can be taken or regulated in new ways, this is a disincentive for you to
<br>
create more property (wealth, capital, what have you) and to plan long
<br>
range.
<br>
<p>Also, given that you might be the recipient of other people's property -- as
<br>
when someone else is taxed to benefit you -- you have less incentive, again,
<br>
to create and more to become such a recipient.  In other words, taking
<br>
property becomes more profitable than making it under such a system.  The
<br>
more extensive the welfare state, the more profitable the former (taking),
<br>
the less profitable the latter (making).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I'm spending all of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time trying to evaluate how much to pay for support of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;private&quot; security force and reading the reports evaluating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether or not they can effectively protect my property, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm *not* going to have the time to read SEC filings by corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I can reasonably allocate capital resources.
</em><br>
<p>How did anyone do it before the SEC then?  The SEC does not have some
<br>
special knowledge.  The SEC does not get information from a crystal ball.
<br>
In fact, the SEC has often been wrong -- else there would be no corruption.
<br>
Even now, the SEC does not evaluate things like offshore hedge funds, whose
<br>
members typically can evaluate that themselves.  (Notably, there is no cry
<br>
from hedge fund investors for the SEC to step in and regulate them, though
<br>
some bureaucrats and brokers want this -- most likely to keep people from
<br>
fleeing from their areas of control.)
<br>
<p>I think most people will not have to do extensive analysis.  I also think
<br>
under a free market in security -- just like a free market in PCs or DVD
<br>
players -- there will be an incentive for protection agencies to give easy
<br>
to analyze, third party verified information on their business.  Surely, the
<br>
less reputable firms won't, but, in the long run, that means they'll be less
<br>
profitable.  That's how the market works.  (That's why people would rather
<br>
put their money in the bank, then, say, give it to Louis down on the corner
<br>
to manage.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I pointed out offlist to Alex, it is a question of delegation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and trust.  If I have to evaluate and manage my own protection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I have to pay someone else to manage my capital allocation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or I can manage my capital allocation and pay someone else to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluate and manage my protection.
</em><br>
<p>It depends on how large your capital and protection needs are.  I can see
<br>
some middle class people hiring people to do both.  I can imagine a lot of
<br>
others managing both on their own -- well or badly -- because they can't
<br>
afford to hire someone right now or don't want to.  I can also conceive some
<br>
choosing a mixed strategy or changing strategies as they accumulate or lose
<br>
property.  (A dotcom millionare who winds up bankrupt probably isn't going
<br>
to worry about huge security concerns.  His condo in the hills might be sold
<br>
to pay his debt, so he'll no longer need to have it policed.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why do people implicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that governments are &quot;plundering&quot; and &quot;running&quot;.  Yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there have been individuals that have done that but it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be the case that more and more they are being brought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice for such crimes.
</em><br>
<p>The point is this.  Institution settings set up incentives and control how
<br>
information flows.  Government itself, regardless of who is running it,
<br>
basically has a set of incentives to plunder.  This is so from basic
<br>
principles of sociology and economics.  (Government being a monopoly of
<br>
coercion with the ability to tax.  It has the incentive to use coercion to
<br>
benefit itself (or who is in power at the moment) and to tax more.  In other
<br>
words, to increase power and revenues.)  It also, since it lacks competitive
<br>
pressure, has no means of determining its true costs and whether it's using
<br>
the right level of security.  (A market would allow people to decide this
<br>
because measuring costs versus benefits.  Such is not possible when there's
<br>
no freedom of entry into the business of security.)
