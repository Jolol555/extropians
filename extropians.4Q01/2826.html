<em>&gt; It seems quite clear that anti-US resentment will not go away soon in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world. Anders spoke about such feelings in EUrope, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rightly said, &quot;And remember - we are your *allies*. Now think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of the world.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These feelings have some good reasons (some of the interventions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentionned here these days, etc.), and some bad reasons (false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representations, jealousy, blaming your misfortunes on someone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and escaping your responsability, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the resentment is bad, not (only) because it is so sad for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US to be misunderstood, but because it allows leaders in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries to bring their countries in destructive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auto-destructive directions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what about issuing a kind of formal, symbolic, named, short,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evocative, simple, strong statement of the basic world view and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentions of the US, for all people to refer to it. It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directed to everyone, and written in terms understandable by all.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with this idea is that any such statement would be not that
<br>
of the people of the US, but of the US government, which for some reason
<br>
the rest of the US-hating world can't seem to comprehend, changes hands
<br>
every 2-8 years or so as the two major parties wax and wane in influence
<br>
and control over various offices. Should George Bush be blamed for the
<br>
misdeeds of Clinton, or Johnson, or Carter, or FDR? If we, the people,
<br>
vote someone out of office and replace them with someone of different
<br>
opinion, shouldn't said US-haters then reevaluate the basis of their
<br>
hate. The fact that it persists irrespective of the current
<br>
administration is indicative that it is not the result of our policies,
<br>
but of their own prejudices, ignorance, and misperceptions of us.
<br>
<p>If Bush issues the statement you ask for, and is replaced in 3 years by
<br>
Gore, would you continue to hold Gore to the standards espoused by Bush?
<br>
<p>This point is illustrative of how much better the US is (and more
<br>
'sophisticated') than the US haters (especially those in europe), as we
<br>
have a very good record here in the US of judging a country not on
<br>
decades of past history, but on its actions NOW, and the policies of the
<br>
governments that are in power now. If a country we see as bad gets
<br>
itself a new government, we are perfectly willing and able to give that
<br>
country a second chance. If the country changes its policies, we will do
<br>
the same. The US haters are constitutionally incapable of doing the
<br>
same. No matter what we do, they will always find a reason to hate us.
