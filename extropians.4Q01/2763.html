<p>
Della just phoned to say that it looks as though my dad's going to die
<br>
today. We'd had plans for a birthday party for Kat today (nothing major,
<br>
just dinner out for Kat and Jeanne and their boyfriends--Jeanne was born at
<br>
the same time as Kat, though her birthday is on the 17th and Kat's is on the
<br>
18th. Jeanne was born around midnight in California; Kat was born around 2
<br>
a.m. in Austin, which is 2 times zones ahead). But we're going to postpone
<br>
the party and go to Houston. I know my mother will need us there. She told
<br>
me yesterday she was ready to let him go, and I think he'd been staying
<br>
alive for her sake. He himself was ready to die some time ago. Now we have
<br>
the ordeal of the funeral and getting my mom settled into her new role of
<br>
wealthy (well ... semi-wealthy) widow. I'll be back in touch with ya soon's
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>Love,
<br>
Barbara
