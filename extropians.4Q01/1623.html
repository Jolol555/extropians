<em>&gt; &gt; Each additional download creates wealth, because information is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infinitely duplicable good.  If we all paid exactly the same amount to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; artists and middlemen, but got ten times as much content at one-tenth the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; price per unit, the net effect on industry revenues would be zero, and yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an enormous amount of wealth would have been created.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, the Dixie Chicks sold 9 million copies of their Fly album in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the two years after it was released [1].  It probably sold for about $15.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they had reduced the cost to 1/10 as much or $1.50, would they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sold 10 times as many copies?  90 million copies?  That's almost as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as there are households in America (116 million [2]).
</em><br>
<p>By hypothesis, that situation (selling 10 times as many copies) was the
<br>
one described above.  If we all pay the same amount, but get ten times as
<br>
much content for it, it follows that on average price must have gone down
<br>
by a factor of ten, and sales must have gone up by a factor of ten.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think the market is that big for the Dixie Chicks' music.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even at $1.50 a copy, they would not sell an album to every household
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the country.  They would make less money at 1/10 the price per unit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Dixie Chicks do better to sell their album for a larger amount and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sell to fewer people.  The exact point of optimality will depend on how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly the market falls off as the price rises.
</em><br>
<p>The point of *global* optimality is that as much information gets
<br>
downloaded as possible.  This is in conflict with the point of optimality
<br>
for the Dixie Chicks if you assume that everyone pays the same price for
<br>
their download.  Except, of course, that the idea that everyone pays the
<br>
same price for an album is another one of those assumptions that may not
<br>
survive the age of downloading.  One way to reconcile the global optimum
<br>
and the Dixie Chicks optimum is to assume that everyone downloads the
<br>
album, and everyone pays the maximum price they would be willing to pay
<br>
for that album, whether it's a cent or (in Bill Gates's case) a million
<br>
dollars.  This maximizes the Dixie Chicks's revenue - to the theoretical
<br>
upmost maximum, in fact - while obeying the fundamental constraint that
<br>
information *must* be downloaded.  The problem would be how to implement
<br>
such a system short of a telepath to watch over it...
