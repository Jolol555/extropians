<br>
<p>The simple fact is that I don't subscribe to your version of either
<br>
history, or the world situation. My views are the result of a long
<br>
process and are always open to new evidence.
<br>
<p>If you think I lack compassion or understanding, then the simple
<br>
truth is that you don't know me very well. I step around bugs
<br>
rather than stepping on them, but at the same time I would have no
<br>
problem blowing a terrorist away. It's not an easy thing to see the
<br>
difference.
<br>
<p>Mine is not a compassion based on weakness or fear, but
<br>
understanding, and your's is not the only worldview.
<br>
<p>I just finished renewing my membership to the Extropy Institute, so
<br>
we will still be here if you change your mind.
<br>
