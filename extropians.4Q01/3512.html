You may remember early this year there was much buzz on the Internet about
<br>
a mysterious new invention by Dean Kamen, famous for his self-balancing
<br>
wheelchair.  Code-named Ginger and sometimes also called IT, people like
<br>
Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos were saying that it would be bigger than the
<br>
internet and that cities would be redesigned around it.
<br>
<p>Since then I have looked in occasionally at fan sites including
<br>
www.ginger-chat.com and www.theitquestion.com.  The most popular guess
<br>
is that Ginger is a self-balancing scooter which you control by leaning.
<br>
There is also speculation that it may be powered by a Stirling engine,
<br>
which is a very low pollution heat engine.
<br>
<p>The big news is that Diane Sawyer announced Monday on Good Morning America
<br>
that Ginger would be revealed a week later on the show, Monday December 3.
<br>
If you go to www.ginger-chat.com you can here a .wav file of her announcement.
<br>
Here is what she said:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember IT? A number of people as I go around the country have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said to me &quot;what about IT, whatever happened to IT? You talked about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT.&quot; Well, we told you earlier about this super-secret brainchild of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inventor Dean Kamen.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mystery invention that, we have been told, not only did it create
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buzz, everyone will have to have one, it will immediately make the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people who sell it richer than Bill Gates. It's that inventive,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that amazing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, are you ready, 'cos one week from today, we're gonna reveal right
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here what IT is. And we don't know either: we don't know if you eat
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, or ride it, or co-anchor with it, we don't know, do we? (laughs)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we're gonna find out one week from today.
<br>
<p>I know a lot of people are going to be disappointed if it is just a
<br>
scooter, and it is hard to see how such a device would justify the hype.
<br>
In fairness, Kamen has tried to rein in the publicity and no doubt is
<br>
frustrated that whatever he shows will fail to live up to expectations.
<br>
