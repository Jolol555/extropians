<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Interestingly, the radical monotheism of Islam has given rise to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pantheism that naturally follows from a rigorously unitary notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;god -- in Sufism. Unfortunately, this has then also been coupled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the radically totalitarian vision of shariah, so that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all-pervasive notion of Sufistic pantheism then doubles back on itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to return to the kind of obsessive social universalism we see in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;facets of Islam. As my study of Islamic thought and history deepens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and widens, I keep looking for signs of the kind of moderating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;influence that the 18th century deists had on Christianity, but to no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;avail. The history of Sufism is a good example of why.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Greg, this paragraph totally confused me. Your use of 'Sufism' makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no sense to me. Yes, Sufis tolerate worship of all gods of different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creeds, cults, or peoples indifferently, but I don't follow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'doubling back' part or why you appear to be equating Sufism with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam. Could you please describe what you mean by Sufism? I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell you what I know about Sufism, from by own books and from personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience and perhaps we can reach an understanding.
</em><br>
<p>[snip description of Sufi ideas]
<br>
<p>Amara, with respect, I think you're falling prey to what I used to call &quot;the
<br>
fallacy of the best&quot; when I was spending a lot of time studying Buddhism and
<br>
also pursuing a formal course of East Asian studies in the 1970s.  I'm sure
<br>
folks of my generation recall the flood of books about Buddhism available to
<br>
curious Western students during the 1960s and 70s.  I've got a bookshelf
<br>
full of them, both of the popular variety (Alan Watts, Gary Snyder, Babba
<br>
Ram Das/Richard Alpert etc.) and of the more scholarly kind (a couple by
<br>
Bhikshu Sangharakshita being among my favorites from the time, I see from
<br>
the well-thumbed and marked-up pages).  What I discovered as I read these
<br>
kinds of books, while at the same time studying the over-all history of East
<br>
Asia and specifically the reality &quot;on the ground&quot; in particular places, was
<br>
a significant disparity between what I found in the books about Buddhism
<br>
available to Western students -- and the kinds of people who were going
<br>
about the work of explaining Buddhism in the West -- on the one hand, and
<br>
the actual practice and perception of Buddhism in East Asia on the other.
<br>
In the material being studied in the West, I saw sophisticated, in-depth
<br>
exposition of the original history of Buddhism and the powerful and
<br>
meaningful concepts that one could find in that history.  The reality on the
<br>
ground was quite different: In practice, for the vast majority of people in
<br>
East Asia, Buddhism tends to be a fairly shallow, syncretistic melange of
<br>
magical thinking and practices, ranging from the deified Buddha and pantheon
<br>
of boddhistava-saints worshipped in much of Southeast Asia, blending off
<br>
into simple animistic magic in the Sinitic world.
<br>
<p>How to account for that disparity?  I concluded that in the West only
<br>
specialists in cultural anthropology and comparative religious studies were
<br>
interested enough in the actual practice of Buddhism to find out what the
<br>
reality of belief and practice was.  For the vast majority of Westerners
<br>
with an interest in Buddhism, the exposition of the best ideas and practices
<br>
found in the work of the popularizers was both sufficient and satisfying.
<br>
Thus, &quot;the fallacy of the best&quot;.
<br>
<p>Anders, in the post that just popped into my inbox as I'm writing this
<br>
points to another, related factor, that we might call &quot;the fallacy of the
<br>
interface filter&quot;.  By this I mean 1) that people are almost always only
<br>
exposed to those &quot;xenogenic&quot; ideas that are actually carried across from a
<br>
foreign culture into their own, 2) that the ideas that get carried across
<br>
the boundary are the ones that &quot;translate&quot; the best into terms
<br>
comprehensible in the receiving culture and 3) that the specific individuals
<br>
who serve as vectors of cross-cultural communication tend to be ones who are
<br>
not &quot;centered&quot; in their own culture, but rather have a more cosmopolitan
<br>
view capable of perceiving multiple cultural viewpoints.  All of these
<br>
factors go together to make the view of some specific foreign cultural
<br>
phenomenon more or less distorted from the reality of that phenomenon in its
<br>
native cultural setting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK, I hope that I've described to you my understanding of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Sufi ideas (there are many more, and I'm far from expert).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My personal experience with some Sufis occurred in 1989/1990 via some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close friends that were volunteering their time doing office work and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer programming for a local Bay Area Sufi organization. Through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, I participated in a festival in Fort Mason, San Francisco, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winter, where a group of Afghanis were holding a festival, in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raise money to buy goods, supplies, agricultural products (especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seed to replant their crops), in order to rebuild Afghanistan after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the devastation wrecked by the Soviets. During the festival, they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selling handworks, music, you could participate in a many-course meal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then at the end of the day they performed some plays of Mulla
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nasrudin stories. I was a stage-hand, backstage, taking care of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; props, while my friends were acting the stories. Not once throughout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that day did anyone there ask me my religious beliefs or impose their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own religious ideas upon me. I found this group of Afghan Sufis to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the warmest, deepest, and most interesting groups of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have ever encountered.
</em><br>
<p>I don't doubt at all that the people to whom you were exposed were as
<br>
open-minded and tolerant as you describe.  However, I think you may have
<br>
been seeing an example of &quot;the interface filter&quot; at work.  The folks with
<br>
whom you were dealing were self-selected for a fairly high level of
<br>
intercultural communication ability and cosmopolitan tolerance for life in a
<br>
foreign society.  Assuming that you don't speak Arabic or Pushtun or
<br>
whatever language your friends absorbed their native culture in, consider
<br>
that all of your exposure to their ideas came through the filter of THEIR
<br>
language study and the considerable inter-cultural experience that any
<br>
person who had made their way from Afghanistan to San Francisco must have
<br>
developed.  Consider also that these people were specifically working to try
<br>
to build sympathy in their audience, therefore consciously or unconsciously
<br>
engaging in the work of being &quot;filters of the worst&quot;.
<br>
<p>With all that said, I'm sure that there is a core of cosmopolitan syncretism
<br>
in the best of Sufi thought.  However, based on my own studies to date, I
<br>
think the historical reality of Sufism is quite different from what comes
<br>
through the filters working on most of what gets through to Western
<br>
intellectuals about Sufism.  First factual tidbit: Consider that the word
<br>
&quot;assassin&quot; comes from the practice of one particular Sufi sect.  Second
<br>
factual tidbit: Sufism is &quot;guru-oriented&quot; (as is most of the actual practice
<br>
of Islam), encouraging the same kind of deference to the ulama that we see
<br>
in extreme forms in the much wider-spread influence of Sunni Wahhabist
<br>
fundamentalism in the Islamic world today.
<br>
<p>Finally, to return to the fairly &quot;compressed&quot; text of my original post upon
<br>
which you comment, I'm seeing in my current studies that Sufism has
<br>
continually been seen as a target of fundamentalist reform.  The means of
<br>
that reform has been to stress the primacy of the sunnah (i.e. &quot;orthopraxy,&quot;
<br>
as Western scholars of Islam seem to call it) in essentially shaming the
<br>
more syncretistic forms of Sufism back into the fold of mainstream Islam.
<br>
As a matter of historical fact, this dynamic results in a division of Sufi
<br>
practice into two strains: Those that cycle back into mainstream Islamic
<br>
fundamentalism and those that don't.  The latter become the targets of
<br>
repression, often violent, since the vast majority of Muslims see the more
<br>
extreme forms of Sufi syncretism as the worst kind of heretical apostasy
<br>
(apostasy being the absolute worst sin any Muslim can commit).
<br>
<p>But I DO think that Sufism offers one of the very few leverage points for
<br>
moderating Islam.  Thus it is a very worthwhile subject of study.
