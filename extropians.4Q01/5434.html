<em>&gt;I know how you feel. That's why I'd prefer to carry a nuke, set to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;off if I die (or perhaps under a variety of conditions). Like the guy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Snowcrash (think it was the guy with 'Poor Self Control' tattoed on his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forehead). This way I hope to incentivise others to keep me safe.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From: &quot;Smigrodzki, Rafal&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;### Actually, should I encounter a person with a nuke wired to his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;head, I would consider it a civic duty to kill him (by a remote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drone, preferably after sedating him, then transporting to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unpopulated area) - in this way I would save lots of innocent lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by preventing his nuke from accidental or planned in-city explosion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then I would kill everybody involved in the procurement of the nuke,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;including the electrophysiologist who made the EEG-detonator setup.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then I widely publicize my willingness and ability to continue such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actions as needed. In this way I would save even more innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lives.
</em><br>
<p><p>oh Yea? I would eliminate the source of the Pu 239, going to every
<br>
nuclear power plant and taking the irradiated fuel rod cannisters
<br>
and killing all those people who work at the plants. Then I would
<br>
put those cannisters on the next Ariane rocket scheduled to launch,
<br>
and send them into space and eliminate those people at the launch site
<br>
too. And just in case some Pu 239 was being transported on the
<br>
highways, I would kill every truck driver. Oh, and to make sure more
<br>
Pu 239 wasn't going to be transported on the roads, I would take
<br>
some explosives and  blow up all of the roads. Then to make sure the
<br>
trains didn't transport Pu 239, I would put garbage on the railroad
<br>
lines to crash the trains. Then after that, I would blow up all
<br>
off-road vehicles with their drivers. But just in case someone would
<br>
try to carry Pu 239 in their backpack on a hike, I would save more
<br>
innocent lives by blowing up all of the hikers. Then I would
<br>
eliminate anyone else's temptation to carry Pu 239, and blow up all
<br>
hiking paths. Then just to be sure, I would starlift the outer
<br>
layers of the Sun burn the Earth to a cinder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I could get pretty bloodthirsty with a guy waving a nuke in my face.
</em><br>
<p>yeah &lt;grunt grunt&gt;
<br>
<p>me too
