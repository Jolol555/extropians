J. R. posted a note about a review of a recent book by Pierre Baldi:
<br>
<p>An included quote:
<br>
<em>&gt; Baldi adds a number of intriguing back-of-the-envelope calculations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this discussion, including an estimate of how much information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contained in a lifetime of experience, or brain inputs: By his estimation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the amount is 2.2x10^18 bits (about 2.7x10^17 bytes), which at current rates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of memory storage advances will be within the memory capacity of a typical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal computer in 27 years. Based on this, Baldi then investigates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information size of what he calls the external self, a complete genomic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequence together with the recording of all inputs and outputs of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals brain over a lifetime, which he estimates to be still on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order of 10^18 bits, within reach of modern computer technology. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal self, the amount of information required to capture the relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure of your brain that defines your identity, is largerat least 10^27
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits but might still be within reach of emerging technologies.
</em><br>
<p>People should take these numbers with a *very* large grain of salt
<br>
for they *are* back-of-the-envelope calculations.
<br>
<p>Based on [1], human long term memory capacity is no more than of the
<br>
order of 10^9 bits (a few hundred megabytes).  This is for &quot;recall&quot;
<br>
memory, which may be somewhat different from &quot;recognition&quot; memory.
<br>
It is very doubtful that humans store a &quot;lifetime&quot; of experience
<br>
(e.g. ~10^18 bits).  It is highly likely that chunking and compression
<br>
occurs.  I'm also very doubtful of the 10^27 bits of structural information.
<br>
At ~10^10 neurons and 10^4 synapses per neuron that only gets you to 10^14
<br>
connections.  I'm very doubtful that there is 10^13 bits of &quot;significant&quot;
<br>
information per synapse.  I'd be interested in what Anders thinks.
