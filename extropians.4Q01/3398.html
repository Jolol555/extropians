<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about real democracies).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No two countries with a &quot;MacDonald's&quot; franchise have ever gone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; war against each other, democracies or otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>I actually think this rule of thumb was broken during the Balkan
<br>
conflict.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, both Japan and Germany were led by governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratically elected by parliamentary systems prior to WWII. Going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back in time, the British government was democratically elected in 1812
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it engaged in war with the democratically elected US government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Going even further back in time, both Sparta and Athens had their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic systems when they engaged in the Pelopponesian War, and Rome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was still a Republic when it took over Greece later on. On the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side of the world, Pakistan and India, two democratic nations, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fought at least three wars against each other when both were led by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elected leaders. Then, for instance, Israel, a parliamentary democracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has fought a war against the Jordanian kingdom, a constitutional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monarchy structured along British lines.
</em><br>
<p>I think several of these examples twist the term democracy; see my other
<br>
post about the need for a stricter term. That Germany and Japan had
<br>
parlamentary systems doesn't mean they were democratic. And the forms of
<br>
democracy of Athens and Sparta were highly different from what we
<br>
currently call democracy, and I have a *very* hard time viewing the
<br>
spartan system as a democracy - it has been described as a democratic
<br>
timocratic monarchical oligarchy, and the democratic part seems to have
<br>
been fairly thin. 
<br>
<p>The 1812 war is more interesting; does anybody have any estimates of the
<br>
freedom index of respective nation at the time?
