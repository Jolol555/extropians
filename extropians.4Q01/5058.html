<p>The possiblity was remote indeed, even under the very
<br>
best of circumstances.  That was the joke, John.  No one
<br>
was getting anything at that college.  Unless one had a car
<br>
and money, there was no place to go.  (I had neither).  At
<br>
that college the infrastructure for such activity was
<br>
conspicuously lacking.  The strategy of the administration
<br>
was to encourage holy matrimony by making the students
<br>
so horny they were on the brink of insanity.  spike
