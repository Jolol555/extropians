<em>&gt; It just hit me that it is very likely that those 200 FAS pages right now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are cached on Google. So you just need to know what you are looking for,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then you can get it.
</em><br>
<p>I sent a note to Google.com asking if they have any plans to censor their
<br>
cache.
<br>
Meanwhile, reports of site scrubbing continue...
<br>
<p>Agencies censor sites deemed useful to terrorists
<br>
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/2001/10/12/govt-sites.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/2001/10/12/govt-sites.htm</a>
<br>
WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal agencies are scrutinizing their Web sites and
<br>
striking any information they believe terrorists might use to plot attacks
<br>
against the nation. The move is quickly reversing strides the government has
<br>
made over the last decade toward providing public information online. The
<br>
review of the government's Web sites is wide in scope. It is unclear whether a
<br>
specific guideline has been passed down about which types of information
<br>
should be removed.
<br>
<p>There also is no uniform process for the review, according to some agency
<br>
officials. Some federal agencies are not commenting on whether they are
<br>
removing information from their Web sites, while others give vague
<br>
descriptions of their deletions.
<br>
<p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shut down its Web site Wednesday.
<br>
<p>NRC spokesman William Beecher said the agency plans to remove the coordinates
<br>
of the nation's 103 commercial nuclear power reactors, among other
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>When Internet surfers try to visit the NRC Web site, they find a note that
<br>
says, &quot;In support of our mission to protect public health and safety, we are
<br>
performing a review of all material on our site. We appreciate your patience
<br>
and understanding during these difficult times.&quot;
<br>
<p>Beecher said most of the information being taken down has been there for
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>&quot;In most cases it is common information, nothing top secret was on the Web
<br>
site to begin with,&quot; Beecher said. &quot;We just don't want to provide anything
<br>
that a terrorist might find helpful.&quot;
<br>
<p>Federal agencies have been reviewing their sites in the wake of the terrorist
<br>
attacks on Sept. 11. Bush spokeswoman Anne Womack said the White House has not
<br>
requested that they do so - the reviews are voluntary.
<br>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency has taken down a Web site with information
<br>
about emergency plans and chemicals at 15,000 sites nationwide.
<br>
<p>Also this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention removed a vague
<br>
report about security at chemical plants from its Web site.
<br>
<p>The U.S. Office of Pipeline Safety is also restricting to industry and
<br>
government officials its mapping software and pipeline data.
<br>
<p>Bush administration officials speculate that all of the data could be useful
<br>
to terrorists.
<br>
<p>There is some evidence that terrorists who crashed planes into the World Trade
<br>
Center and Pentagon used the Internet to accomplish their mission, Attorney
<br>
General John Ashcroft has said.
<br>
<p>Ashcroft also told Congress that one person in federal custody had downloaded
<br>
information about crop-dusting planes, which could be used for biological or
<br>
chemical attacks.
<br>
<p>Some watchdog groups and first amendment attorneys worry the Web site
<br>
restructuring will separate people needlessly from public information.
<br>
<p>&quot;In many ways, it is ridiculous, because this information is public, and the
<br>
Internet is a public domain,&quot; said Landry Bolville, a first amendment attorney
<br>
in Washington. &quot;Any piece of information could be used by a terrorist, and it
<br>
seems like a lot of what is being altered is not directly dangerous. You
<br>
haven't made life harder for the terrorist; you've just made it harder for
<br>
taxpaying citizens.&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
