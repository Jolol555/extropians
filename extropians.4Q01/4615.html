<p>
military destablization could occur when an external force attempts to 
<br>
'stabilize' in a direction different than that of the target-nation.  thus, 
<br>
the target-nation is in unwanted transition and is destablized for a time 
<br>
period (dependent upon how flexibility of the target-country [in receiving 
<br>
these new rules] and on the mass of the external force).
<br>
<p>aid is usually a strong persuasion or a complete modification.  or it can 
<br>
actually behave as preservative stabilization.  but why would an external 
<br>
nation bother to stablize another nation unless there were some benefit?  
<br>
since the nation is so vulnerable, why not modify it to suit in the process?
<br>
<p>i don't know if dictator-support is stabilization.  it depends on a lot of 
<br>
variables: citizen-affinity for dicatorships, initial government condition, 
<br>
desired (external) govt condition.  from what i have seen from 
<br>
post-communist greece, romania, bulgaria; i am very confused/upset/appauled 
<br>
about 'dictatorships'.  the greek citizens have told me that america 
<br>
designed and implemented the greek dictatorship in the 60/70s.  perhaps it 
<br>
was a america-is-coming-to-E-europe restructuring in disguise.  i realize 
<br>
that i must collect all of the data myself; it's mostly visuospatial this 
<br>
year ;)
<br>
<p>aid can also occur in &quot;non-aid&quot; formats such as advertisement-saturation, 
<br>
foreign nationals engaged in commerce, govt, infra, etc.  perhaps every 
<br>
nation is a cell with its particular membrane structure, defending 
<br>
temporarily until the ion with the right /charge/ comes by and changes 
<br>
everything.

<p>ps= if you are doing lots of winter travel this season; with multiple 
<br>
destinations; make sure you choose a good hub (atom) and make it your 
<br>
homebase.  draw your itinerary on paper, if it looks like a relatively 
<br>
balanced electronic diagram; you are in good shape.

<p>I was wondering if you could provide details on how military aid can
<br>
destabilize a country.  I know you provided sources, but unfortunately I
<br>
can't read German, so if you could explain this phenomenon, or direct me to
<br>
a site in English that would do such, I'd be much obliged.  I was under the
<br>
impression that during the cold war we were in the habit of stabilizing
<br>
countries whether they needed stabilization or not (propping up 
<br>
dictators...).
