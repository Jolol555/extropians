<em>&gt; &gt; Lee, Lee, Lee, it is rather obvious to anybody who isn't being purposely

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it is necessary in addition for there to be a general social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognition that the seller have a legitimate property right in that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying &quot;Breathe my air!  Only $1 per lungful!&quot; and I may take what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offered for sale without paying for it, but few would agree that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have committed theft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the case of intellectual property, then, the question is whether there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is recognition of a property right in that which is offered for sale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When someone takes your property, that is theft.  But ownership of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual property differs from that of regular property, which is why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional statutes were needed to cover it.  Copying your data doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; match the common understanding of theft because there is no recognition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a conventional property right as there is with ordinary physical objects.
</em><br>
<p>As I recall, this whole class of law is called 'intellectual property',
<br>
ergo, it is regarded as a property right.
