</em><br>
<p>Those of us who distrust the government trust these foreign infiltrators
<br>
and terrorists even less. Much as the Nationalists and Communist Chinese
<br>
joined forces to fight the Japanese invaders, we must do the same. My
<br>
goals (and those of other freedom lovers) are anathema to the radical
<br>
islamic world. They are a classic example that the enemy of one's enemy
<br>
is not always one's friend. I, and others, can at least maintain our own
<br>
assets and abilities while contributing to the fight, and if the
<br>
government doesn't relinquish it's police powers when the conflict is
<br>
over, I will most certainly be involved in measures to force it to. Now
<br>
is not the time, though. We must renew the social trust by weeding out
<br>
those who seek to undermine it permanently, and they should not be
<br>
treated with TLC.
<br>
<p>Further note: The Geneva Conventions also say that they only apply to
<br>
those who agree to abide by them. When an insurgent/infiltrator/enemy
<br>
combatant uses civilians and civilian assets as shields, the Geneva
<br>
Conventions recognise that they then become a combatant target. There
<br>
are no war crimes committed.
<br>
<p>This is much like in soccer: you play for the ball, not the opposing
<br>
player. If an opposing player is injured, but the ump determines you
<br>
were playing for the ball, then there is no foul.
