</em><br>
<p>I'm hewing close to the convenient short term on my recent posts to this list.
<br>
I'm considering it more deeply that I let on, Robert. I have struggled with
<br>
the question of how much thinking to spout on the list proper. The hell with it,
<br>
here goes another braindump. Step back so you don't get any on your shoes.
<br>
<p>&lt;/rantmode=ON&gt;
<br>
<p>The thing is, everyone with a &quot;more legitimate&quot; grudge than the
<br>
luddites and fundies of all stripes (and I mean &quot;more legitimate&quot;
<br>
from my perspective as a liberal-tarian) still has common cause with
<br>
the fundies. Looking at the rhetoric, functional coalitions are 
<br>
certainly in evidence.
<br>
<p>It's Hate America season, and arguably has been since the Monroe Doctrine 
<br>
really got teeth. Smedley Butler was twice decorated with the Medal of Honor, 
<br>
and he came out with his &quot;War is a racket!&quot; line in the 1920s, after the War
<br>
That Didn't End All Wars.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Sidebar, related to pancritical rationalism if you look at it hard enough: 
<br>
As a person who was programmed with Frank Capra and Baden-Powell, etc.,
<br>
I find it deeply ironic that &quot;disillusionment&quot; connotes a sorry state; it's
<br>
as if we recognize that the illusion is really preferable. Ever notice that
<br>
in this culture? &quot;Childhood's end&quot;--but why do we have to lie so much? Hmm?
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Memetically, it's a multi-front war that's been put in a blender. 
<br>
<p>There are people who have been wronged by the smiling striped giant with a goatee, 
<br>
and there are people who have been wronged by his smiling Armani-suited associates, 
<br>
and there are people who have been double-teamed by the two of them.
<br>
<p>And _then_ there are people who would *know* in their *bones* that pancritical 
<br>
rationalism is a tool of utter evil.
<br>
<p>The third group is by no means composed solely of feudal foreigners.
<br>
<p>Recall the de Bono line about the primary purpose of thinking being to abolish thinking.
<br>
Whew, glad that's over! That was hard work. Now I can get back to the purpose of my life!
<br>
Rationalism, as practiced, is a tool for getting one's way, just like all the others.
<br>
<p>And pancritical rationalism would never have developed _even as a theory_ in a society 
<br>
that those third-group people would consider healthy. Bartley would have been burned 
<br>
along with his writings, if his forebears hadn't been.
<br>
<p>Nowadays he's just being ignored or painted as part of the overall relativism
<br>
&quot;sickness&quot;. Big improvement?
<br>
<p>It's also complicated by the fact that as things stand, the existing Western
<br>
power structures, warts, jewels and all, have to maintain thick faces and change, 
<br>
if at all, only slowly, or too much noise will show up in the system. 
<br>
<p>How much noise (/chaos)(/change)(/rate of change) is too much? Depends.
<br>
How much of a conspiracy to believe in? How about the conspiracy of &quot;getting
<br>
back to normal&quot;? Does that count? Doesn't &quot;normal&quot; suck, pretty much?
<br>
<p>&lt;/rantmode=OFF&gt;
<br>
<p>Let's shift gears here:
<br>
<p>There was an ad for M&amp;Ms back a long time ago; it's set in a Western saloon:
<br>
<p>&quot;These cards are MARKED!&quot; &quot;They a MESS!&quot; &quot;A CHOCOLATE MESS!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Hold on, pards! The 'dirty dealer' mean no harm...&quot;
<br>
<p>The candy-coated shell of M&amp;Ms, of course, provides a solution, and a happy ending.
<br>
<p>PCR needs a hard candy-coated shell. And it needs lots of distribution points.
<br>
<p>And it needs quality control. Or it'll lapse into plain old rationalism-tool-to-manipulate-others.
<br>
<p>That is a mighty tough row to hoe, but the alternative is scratching the old played-out dirt with
<br>
a stick and hoping some feeble crop will spring up eventually.
<br>
<p>It's a chocolate mess. But some of the chocolate is edible.
<br>
<p>Mike
