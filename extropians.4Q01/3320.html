<p>You'd *execute people* because of what they said? Aren't you a fan of

</em><br>
<p>Isn't part of that responsibility enduring that government doesn't get
<br>
out of hand?  Isn't this about to get -way- out of hand?
<br>
It seems to me that while no one is supporting the terrorists, an awful

lot of people find the idea of these military courts deeply disturbing.
