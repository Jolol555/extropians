<p>This is actually a &quot;tax protestor&quot; argument, slightly disguised: its
<br>
main point is to ostensibly provide a means by which you don't have
<br>
to pay income tax.  A good resource for the failure of such arguments
<br>
to be accepted by the courts is the &quot;Tax Protestor Hall of Fame&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2278/sloan.html">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2278/sloan.html</a>.  It presents a long
<br>
list of cases where the courts rejected &quot;soverign citizen&quot; arguments as
<br>
well as the many others which have been advanced to support non-payment
<br>
of tax.
<br>
<p>The Sloan case at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2278/sloan.html">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2278/sloan.html</a>
<br>
is typical.  Some excerpts:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like moths to a flame, some people find themselves irresistibly drawn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the tax protestor movement's illusory claim that there is no legal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requirement to pay federal income tax.  And, like the moths, these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people sometimes get burned.  Lorin G. Sloan believed these claims and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he acted upon them now faces four months in a federal prison;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there can be little doubt that he has been burned.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also basic to Mr. Sloan's &quot;freedom from income tax theory&quot; is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his contention that he is not a citizen of the United States, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather, that he is a freeborn, natural individual, a citizen of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State of Indiana, and a &quot;master&quot;--not &quot;servant&quot;--of his government.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, he claims that he is not subject to the jurisdiction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the laws of the United States.  This strange argument has been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;previously rejected as well.  &quot;All individuals, natural or unnatural,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must pay federal income tax on their wages,&quot; regardless of whether
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they requested, obtained or exercised any privilege from the federal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government.  Lovell, 755 F.2d at 519; cf. Studley, 783 F.2d at 937
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Studley's argument that &quot;she is not a 'taxpayer' because she is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an absolute, freeborn and natural individual ... is frivolous.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An individual is a 'person' under the Internal Revenue Code.&quot;).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real tragedy of this case is the unconscionable waste of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Sloan's time, resources, and emotion in continuing to pursue
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these wholly defective and unsuccessful arguments about the validity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the income tax laws of the United States.  Despite our rejection
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Mr. Sloan's legal analysis of the tax laws, we are not unmindful
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the sincerity of his beliefs.  On the other hand, we are less
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sure of the sincerity of the professional tax protestors who promote
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their views in literature and meetings to persons like Mr. Sloan,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet are unlikely ever to face the type of penalties incurred by him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that our decision will not alter Mr. Sloan's views regarding
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tax laws of this country, for he has stated that if we affirm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his conviction without applying the law as he understands it, our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decision will be &quot;a sham to which I WILL NOT SUBMIT.&quot;  It may also be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that serving his sentence in prison will not alter Mr. Sloan's view.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope this pessimistic assessment is incorrect.
