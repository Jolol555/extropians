<p>Actually, I bought mine because I didn't want to be with out

them when the bureaucrats outlaw them completely and I wanted to
<br>
stand up to those who say &quot;common&quot; citizens should not be
<br>
trusted with such means of defense.

<p><em>&gt;  - People believe in religions because they feel alone without and

</em><br>
<p>To the extent I believe in such things it has nothing at all to
<br>
do with any sort of &quot;just in case&quot; thinking or with feeling
<br>
alone.  It does provide some sense of extra empowerment but it
<br>
is not in the least a primary motivation.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  - People believe in cryonics and such because they fear to die, even if

</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, the fear of death and seeking to avoid it is certainly
<br>
fully rational unless one believes in an afterlife and perhaps
<br>
even then.  While it hasn't been done yet a slim hope of future
<br>
revival is seen as better than no hope. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  - People believe in transhumanism to find comfort in the fiction of a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is one is utterly absurd.  People are transhumanists
<br>
because they believe it is possible to transcend the current
<br>
human condition in various ways and are actively willing to
<br>
engage in the attempt to do so.  Just believing in the
<br>
possibility with no work or support of work relevant to it or at
<br>
least spreading the meme of the possibility cannot possibly do
<br>
anyone any good so there is no &quot;just in case&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  - etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>By all means let us wave our hands and conjure up all other
<br>
pointless generalities in a similar vein.
