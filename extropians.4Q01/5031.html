This compilation of definitions first appeared almost ten years ago, and 
<br>
had it's last real update back in 1994. It's about time we updated it!
<br>
<p>The updated version will be linked from ExI's new FAQ, as well as providing 
<br>
a useful reference linked from elsewhere on the site.
<br>
<p>I've done a quick edit, removing a few terms that never caught on and 
<br>
didn't seem particularly useful. I *know* that there are a whole bunch of 
<br>
other terms and their definitions that should be included. I haven't even 
<br>
tried to add the obvious ones (such as &quot;extropic art&quot;, &quot;singularitarian&quot;, etc.)
<br>
<p>YOUR SUGGESTED TERMS AND DEFINITIONS PLEASE!
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
<p>Max

<br>
ADHOCRACY: A non-bureaucratic networked organization. &quot;This form is already 
<br>
common in organizations such as law firms, consulting companies and 
<br>
research universities. Such organizations and institutions must continually 
<br>
readjust to a changing array of projects, each requiring somewhat different 
<br>
combinations of skills and other resources. These organizations depend on 
<br>
many rapidly shifting project teams and much lateral communication among 
<br>
these relatively autonomous, entrepreneurial groups.&quot; [Scientific American, 
<br>
Sept. 1991, p.133. Alvin Toffler, Future Shock, 1970]

<br>
<p>VENTURISM: An immortalist transhumanism founded on the principles (1) to do 
<br>
what is right, understood as implying the benefiting of intelligent life

<br>
advocacy and promotion of the worldwide conquest of death through 
<br>
technological means. [David Pizer, 1986]
<br>
<p>VIRTUAL COMMUNITY: A community of persons not located in close physical 
<br>
proximity but forming a cultural community across computer networks.
<br>
<p>VIRTUAL RIGHTS: Rights given for convenience to a partial; these rights are 
<br>
really rights of the person whose partial it is, rather than of the partial
