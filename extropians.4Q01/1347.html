<em>&gt; our debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I contend that you have primitive/backward political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idols in your head that are at the same level as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vatican, Mormons, Baptists, Islam &amp;c. As long as these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idols infest your mind it's extremely unlikely that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll become capable of posthuman politics.
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean by &quot;idol&quot;? Something like your
<br>
&quot;anti-Law&quot; idol perhaps? I assure you I have nonesuch.
<br>
My defence of &quot;Law&quot; is really just to counter-balance 
<br>
your rather obsessive anti-Law sentiments, I am not
<br>
particularly bothered either way ... if you can get things
<br>
to run the same or better with fewer of no Laws, then
<br>
fine. My doubts are that you can.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chief among your idols is the notion of &quot;Law&quot; in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head (which you sometimes capitalize in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mormons, Muslims, etc. capitalize &quot;God,&quot; &quot;Allah,&quot; etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Oh! Give an example of what I've said that makes you
<br>
think this? &quot;Do what thout wilt shall be the whole of 
<br>
the Law &quot; www.enochia.net Do you think I am a
<br>
Crowleyite cos of Enochian Chess? If so u r wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have provided you with references on how to clear
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Idols of Human Understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Francis Bacon (condensed and edited):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The idols and false notions which are now in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possession of the human understanding, and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken deep root therein, not only so beset men's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds that truth can hardly find entrance, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even after entrance obtained, they will again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the very instauration of the sciences meet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and trouble us, unless men being forewarned of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the danger, fortify themselves as far as may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible against their assaults.
</em><br>
<p>Where in Bacon (ESSAY on Human Understanding?)
<br>
does he attack the notion of Laws? Not in my
<br>
reading of him .....
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are four classes of idols which beset
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men's minds. To these, for distinction's sake,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have assigned names:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Idols of the tribe;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Idols of the cave;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Idols of the marketplace;
</em><br>
<p>Thats you that is!!!!!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Idols of the theater.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idols of the tribe have their foundation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human nature itself, and in the tribe, race, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture of men. It is a false assertion that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure of man is the measure of things. On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary, all perceptions as well as the sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the mind are according to the measure of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual and not according to the measure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe. And human understanding is like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false mirror, which, receiving rays irregularly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distorts and discolors the nature of things by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mingling its own nature with it.
</em><br>
<p>Meaningless pap. I'm out of the Iceni tribe. Hardly
<br>
my fault though, accident of birth ..... so what?
<br>
Is having an &quot;Idol&quot; of a tribe different from thinking
<br>
you are in a tribe then?
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idols of the cave are the idols of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual man. Everyone has a cave or a den
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of his own, which refracts and discolors the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light of nature; owing to his personal and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peculiar nature; or to his education and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation with others; or to the reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of books, and the authority of those whom he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; esteems and admires; or to the differences of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impressions, accordingly as they take place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a mind preoccupied and predisposed, or in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mind indifferent and settled; or the like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So that the spirit of man (according as it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meted out to different individuals) is in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thing variable and full of perturbation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governed as it were by chance. Whence it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well observed by Heraclitus that men look for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sciences in their own lesser worlds, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the greater or common world.
</em><br>
<p>Plato meets pop-Buddhism meets drivel.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are also idols formed by the intercourse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and association of men with each other, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I call idols of the marketplace, on account of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the commerce and consort of men there. For it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is by discourse that men associate; and words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are imposed according to the apprehension of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the vulgar. 
</em><br>
<p>Well f*ck me sideways, yer not wrong there c*nt.
<br>
<p>And therefore the ill and unfit
<br>
<em>&gt; choice of words wonderfully obstructs the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Your whole approach is too wordy. If you want
<br>
to do something about bad Laws (whether this is
<br>
just some of them, as I think, or all of them as 
<br>
you claim) then stand for political election. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lastly, there are idols which have immigrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into men's minds from the various dogmas of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies, and also from wrong laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstration. These I call idols of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theater; because in my judgment all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; received systems are but so many stage-plays,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representing worlds of their own creation after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an unreal and scenic fashion.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Why not call them idols of philosophy then? 
<br>
And why lastly? Why only four types? How
<br>
can you be sure ... I can think of some better
<br>
candidates ... wot about idols of pretension?
<br>
