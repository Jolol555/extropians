<p><em>&gt; Anti-gunners 
</em><br>
<p>OK, no more gun troll feeding! The argument seems to be going nowhere and I
<br>
understand has not been particularly productive in the past.  Let's go back
<br>
to the original issues in the thread:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I am saying is that there needs to be a filtration system put in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place between high trust and low trust societies. Failing to do so will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only result, as we have seen, in a social equivalent of the old 'bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money pushes out good money' phenomenon. Allowing unrestricted access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals from low trust societies only results in your high trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society becoming diluted into a low trust society, at a rate relative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rate of immigration.
</em><br>
<p>No-one has 'unrestricted access' to US society; the INS already has a pretty
<br>
aggressive policy towards non-residents, as I myself found out when working
<br>
in the US. I suggest that any problem of access should be dealt with by
<br>
refining the access (i.e. Visa-granting) procedures; not by suggesting that
<br>
anyone who is not a US citizen should be judged guilty of a crime until
<br>
proven innocent. The cornerstone of US society appears (to an outsider) to
<br>
be the way in which all people living in the US are treated equally. To
<br>
throw this away is surely both unwarranted and dangerous?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We know that al Qaeda was based in the Sudan with the support of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sudanese government, and from there, they recruited and sent terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the US to bomb the WTC in 1993. This is just the tip of the iceberg.
</em><br>
<p>But as far as your argument was phrased, you were not suggesting that the
<br>
INS treat applicants from (eg) the Sudan) with additional suspicion. Rather,
<br>
you were suggesting that all immigrants from the Sudan be treated as guilty
<br>
of any crime until proven innocent, and treated differently to any other US
<br>
citizen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Al Qaeda itself was the security arm of the Taliban government. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rock have you been hiding under?
</em><br>
<p>Again, I don't understand your position. Are you suggesting that all Afghan
<br>
refugees fleeing from such a regime should be treated as terrorists? We can
<br>
surely make a distinction between bona fide refugees from a regime of
<br>
terror, and the terrorists (and their supporters) who are running the
<br>
country?
