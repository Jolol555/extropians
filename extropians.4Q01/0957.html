<p><em>&gt; Why?  We would still get cold.  Did you mean we would have zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privacy?  Im already over that.
</em><br>
<p>I don't mean to have my statements construed as supporting privacy. I wish to make the point that such changes to open up full
<br>
information flow may require a very significant lifestyle change, and so much that we might have our cultural notions turned upside
<br>
down and might need to set up a new variety of society to function. Not wearing clothes (for the purpose of concealment) would
<br>
surely qualify as one of such possible changes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; At some time future we reach the point where anyone can slay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone.  At that time, I do not expect anyone would be banging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right to privacy drum.  As that day approaches, how do we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide how much privacy should be ensured?  spike
</em><br>
<p>I vote for the Global Mind Link and full disclosure. Meanwhile, we have to consider those unwilling to take part in such an
<br>
experience, and perhaps setting up a new colony where we can live without worrying about terrorists and other anti-progressive
<br>
behavior would provide the best solution.

<p>The world just got more dangerous recently. Time to prepare to evacuate from Planet Earth.

<br>
<p>Confronting the Mob
<br>

<br>
Muslim leaders must now side with Bush or bin Laden. For most, it’s a dangerous choice
<br>
<p>Oct. 22 issue —  In the Nasser neighborhood of the Gaza Strip, a few dozen men sit on white plastic chairs and sip bitter coffee at
<br>
a wake for 13-year-old Abdullah al-Ifranji. The boy had been struck in the head by a policeman’s bullet. Two days earlier, shortly
<br>
after leaving his school across from the Islamic University, he walked into the middle of a violent demonstration. Handwritten
<br>
condolences from Hamas, the radical Islamic group, hang on every wall of the house.
<br>
<p><p>Extract:
<br>
If not, many Arab officials privately say, this could be the eve of destruction for the old order in the Middle East. The very
<br>
regimes that Washington is depending on as allies in the war on terror—from Saudi Arabia to Egypt—could be toppled. And that’s just
<br>
what Osama bin Laden wants. While most demonstrations remained fairly small last week, pessimists fear a violent Islamic backlash
<br>
that begins with street protests and pictures of bin Laden, and ends in a Taliban- or Iranian-style revolution. At a rally inside
<br>
Cairo’s Al-Azhar mosque, people held the Quran in the air and raised banners declaring JIHAD IS THE SOLUTION.
