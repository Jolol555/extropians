<p>(I like to write long posts addressing different points.  Sometimes I wonder
<br>
if people just skip such long posts.  I don't want to post a lot of small
<br>
posts.  I wonder if using subheaders in my post will make it easier to scan
<br>
for ideas.  Comments?)
<br>
<p>Exact Copies:
<br>
------------
<br>
The copy question often involves the theoretically exact copy experiencing
<br>
the exact environment.  I think this is impossible.  There are difficulties
<br>
in science when measuring the position of particles precisely without
<br>
modifying them.  We cannot control random Brownian motion of atoms and
<br>
molecules bouncing around by themselves.  We cannot control air particles or
<br>
background radiation.  Even before we can finish creating a copy, it's
<br>
molecules would be moving and changing from moment to moment.  I do not
<br>
believe that an exact copy is possible.  Anybody who require precise exact
<br>
copies will be disappointed.
<br>
<p>Exact Environments:
<br>
------------------
<br>
This means that sensory input and environments cannot be duplicated exactly.
<br>
Coin flips may be different for the two copies.  Random stomach gurgling or
<br>
skin itches will be different.  Their hair will randomly toss in different
<br>
directions.  They never could get the same random dust particle under one of
<br>
their contacts at the same time.  If they wash a contact under a stream of
<br>
water, it wouldn't dislodge the irritating particle at the precise same
<br>
moment.  So the concept of an identical environment for the two copies is
<br>
conceptually interesting, but irrelevant to the real world.  Both copies
<br>
will immediately diverge and start experiencing different events.
<br>
<p>Exact VR Sensory Input:
<br>
----------------------
<br>
The suggestion of VR seems to imply that we can feed sensory input from one
<br>
to the other.  This is even more problematic.  One copy would have to be
<br>
implanted with sensory recording devices throughout their body while the
<br>
other would have to be implanted with sensory feedback devices throughout
<br>
their body.  This functional difference would make the copies structurally
<br>
different.  Moreover, the concept would only work if all sensory playback
<br>
could be replayed in real-time with resolution equal to that of reality.
<br>
This would require massive amounts of bandwidth with no delays or bit errors
<br>
ever.  Thus, VR seems to introduce more problems than it answers.
<br>
<p>Desirability of Exact Copies:
<br>
-----------------------------
<br>
Finally, I doubt that an exact copy would desired, even if it were possible.
<br>
The copy discussion stems out of the immortality discussion.  We are trying
<br>
to find ways to replace our dying bodies with new immortal bodies.  Exact
<br>
copies would die in the same way as the original.  We would want to transfer
<br>
ourselves into different and better bodies.  Thus, I think the complicated
<br>
methods being proposed to produce exact copies is moot.  Different and
<br>
better copies are much better for our purposes.  Why copy our wrinkles or
<br>
disease?  Why not exclude imperfections, damage, viruses, and DNA damage
<br>
while copying?  These seem to be obvious choices, but would modify the
<br>
context of the copy discussion.  Rather than talking about exact copies, we
<br>
would be talking about recreating similar yet profoundly different copies.
<br>
Discussions about these different copies and how to migrate our
<br>
self-identities to these copies would be of more importance to our goals.
