&lt;&lt;I agree. I love the libertarian philosophy but I love &lt;life even more. George Bush you have done a lot of &lt;stupid things but now is not the time to criticize &lt;you, the stuff you have done in the past month seems &lt;fine to me and I'm very glad I don't have you're job. &lt;George, I wish you well.

<p>&lt;      John K Clark     <a href="mailto:jonkc@att.net?Subject=Re:%20What%20is%20Bin%20Rotten%20was%20your%20neighbor?&In-Reply-To=&lt;33.1cb8700f.2904c8d0@aol.com&gt;">jonkc@att.net</a>&gt;&gt;

<p>My comment concerns the dropping of the other shoe. That W Bush needs to liberate American reliance from Wahabbi-owned fuels-namely oil. And no! I don't buy the &quot;lets use their oil up first&quot; philosophy peddled by morons, who have no &quot;backup&quot; fuel source. 
<br>
<p>I am guessing that most anyone on this list could come up with a more aggressive and sensible energy plan then W has, or his sexually-pre-occupied, antecdent, Bubba Clinton. Lets not break out the champaigne yet! This situation needs work, badly.
