Hiya
<br>
<p>I'm offline and so only wandering in and poking my head occasionally.
<br>
<p>Joe didn't write this, he quoted someone else. No idea who. But I left
<br>
his name in so you guys could figure it out.
<br>
Or maybe I should have deleted it. Oh well.
<br>
<p><p>Anyway:

<p><em>&gt; &gt; As previously observed, the US is perceived by a vast majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Muslims as being something reprehensible. The reason for this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; primarily because of our ongoing support for Israel, despite her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ongoing illegal occupation of the West Bank and brutal oppression of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilians. Secondly due to our involvement in 3rd world countries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; usually to put down &quot;democratic&quot; movements in the hope of promoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;stability&quot; or against &quot;socialist&quot; movements in the &quot;war against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communism.&quot; What this has meant is that the US is generally perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to have been taking the part of dictators and kings, against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unenfranchised and those discriminated against. This applies even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Kuwait (where we are seen as having thrown out a dictator whom we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; created, in order to preserve a more pliant king). Thirdly, we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen to abandon our allies as soon as we achieve our immediate goals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leaving them to absorb the brunt of any retribution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So we are indubitably seen as the worlds greatest oppressors and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hypocrites. The truth of this is largely irrelevant. It is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perception which matters.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>For what it's worth, this is pretty much the perception in Australia.
<br>
<p>Like, tah muchly for being on our side (well, thanks for allowing us to
<br>
base your listening posts on our soil and graciously extending your
<br>
nuclear umbrella beyond the perimeter fence) and soaking up our dodgy
<br>
tourism promotional materials, but that's how the US is perceived here.
<br>
It's okay, we still wuv you, but you're not exactly a well-behaved
<br>
country, and I doubt there were many people here confused as to why
<br>
someone would want to harm the US.
<br>
<p>As in the quote, whether this is true or not is a different issue
<br>
entirely, but it is certainly the popular perception, despite our supine
<br>
media.
<br>
<p>Dwayne
<br>
just my bit of international perspective.
