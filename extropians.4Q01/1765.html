<br>
<p>The Legacy of the Middle Ages in the American Wild West
<br>
<p>by Lynn White, Jr.
<br>
<p>Men may be killed in many ways.  In most societies, however, there are clear
<br>
rubrics for execution, a tradition of propriety as to the forms of killings
<br>
committed by the group, which the group feels deeply impelled to follow,
<br>
perhaps, because to follow them makes the past share the guilt of the
<br>
execution.  To know the subliminal mind of a society, one must study the sources
<br>
of its liturgies of inflicting death.
<br>
<p>Throughout the American Wild West the rubric for execution was single and
<br>
uniform: hanging by a rope.  In Greco-Roman times hanging with a rope or
<br>
cincture was common as a means of suicide: one recalls Jocasta and Judas.  But
<br>
it is important for understanding any society to distinguish the customs of
<br>
suicide from those of execution as well as from the rubrics of human sacrifice.
<br>
<p>The dismal history of execution has seldom distinguished clearly the various
<br>
modes of &quot;hanging&quot;---impalement, crucifixion, suspension by the neck in the
<br>
crotch of a tree, or by a rope---and contemporary accounts are normally
<br>
ambiguous.  All biblical references to hanging appear to indicate exposure of
<br>
the impaled corpse after execution, or else crucifixion.(34)  Execution by
<br>
suspended strangulation was not practiced by Greeks or Romans in pagan times. 
<br>
The suppression of crucifixion, presumably by Constantine, because of religious
<br>
sensibility, left a void in the Roman repertory of execution which still existed
<br>
at the promulgation of the Theodisian *Code* in 438, but which had been filled
<br>
by 533 when Justinian's *Digest* systematically substituted *furca* for
<br>
*crux*.(35)
<br>
<p>The *furca* was a post with the fork of two branches at the top.  The culprit
<br>
was hoisted so that his neck was placed in the fork, a piece of wood (*vinculum
<br>
patibuli*) was nailed behind his head across the fork, and he was left to
<br>
strangle.  Since there is no oriental or classical precedent for such a manner
<br>
of execution, and since *gabalus*, a synonym for *furca*, is derived (as is the
<br>
German *Gabel*) from Celtic,(36) the new rubric probably came from the north. 
<br>
Tacitus tells us that the Germans hanged traitors and cowards
<br>
<p>[...]&quot;error in my laptop saving MS Word in Rich Text format&quot; Terry...
<br>
<p>that this destruction and slaughter was an offering to the gods.  In later
<br>
centuries among the pagan Scandinavians, hanging with a rope was a highly
<br>
specialized rubric of human sacrifice to the god Odin.  Bodies of hanged victims
<br>
have been found buried, according to Norse custom, in peat bogs with the noose
<br>
still around the neck.(40)  That they were hanged and not simply strangled is
<br>
known from two pictures: first, a man hanged from a tree next to an altar, shown
<br>
on a stone from Hammars in Larbro (Gotland), *ca.* 700;(41) second, six men
<br>
hanging from a pair of sacred trees, shown on a tapestry of the ninth century
<br>
found in the Oseberg ship burial.(42)  Even in the later eleventh century, Adam
<br>
of Bremen tells us that a Christian who visited the great shrine of Uppsala
<br>
counted seventy-two bodies of men, horses, and hounds hanged as sacrifices on
<br>
the trees of the temple grove.(43)
<br>
<p>Although the suicide of Judas with a rope had been represented since the fifth
<br>
century,(44) there is no depiction in Christian art of an execution by hanging
<br>
with a rope until the first half of the eleventh century when two appear.  One,
<br>
by a strange coincidencfe, is in the same manuscript of Aelfric in which we
<br>
found the rudiments of the coach.(45)  The other is in the Roda Bible(46) from
<br>
Catalonia.  Thereafter, such representations are common.  Most fascinating is an
<br>
Italian miniature of *ca.* 1130-40: six men are hoisting a victim with a rope
<br>
around his neck, but the rope passes not over the beam of a gallows but over the
<br>
horizontal rod, already nailed in place, across the fork of a *furca*.(47) 
<br>
Clearly, the artist knows in detail, perhaps from pictures, what a *furca* had
<br>
looked like, but he no longer knows how it was used: within his horizon the
<br>
transition to the new mode of public execution was complete.
<br>
<p>Since the Viking age was a time of great flux in Scandinavia, it appears that by
<br>
the tenth century the old line dividing sacrifice from penal execution was
<br>
crumbling, at least among outlying Norse groups: in 922, Ibn Fadlan explicitly
<br>
mentions the rope hanging of thieves among the Swedes on the Volga.(48)  As for
<br>
the West, the conversion of Danes, Norwegians, and Icelanders to Christianity
<br>
about the year 1000, at a moment when Norse influences were pervading much of
<br>
Europe, probably secularized the Viking technique of human sacrifice and made it
<br>
widely available as a rubric of execution.  The persistent mediaeval conviction
<br>
that the oak was a good tree for hanging and that gallows should be built of oak
<br>
--- &quot;Eichbaum gibt gut Galgen&quot;(49) --- has nothing to do with the tensile
<br>
strength of wood.  The oak was so widely regarded as numenous that we can
<br>
scarcely escape the conclusion that late mediaeval rope hanging was religious in
<br>
its origins.  When, about 1060, the enraged Duke William of Normandy swore to
<br>
hang a recalcitrant abbot &quot;ad altiorem quercum vicinae silvae,&quot;(50) his pagan
<br>
Norse ancestors may have been speaking more loudly
