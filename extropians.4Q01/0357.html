<p>It depends. There's this island where a guy with a gun and a title rounded
<br>
up all the shovels. A hundred other guys who'd like to work their plots of
<br>
land can't do so, because the guy won't let them use the shovels. One day
<br>
they get together and take his gun and shovels from him and start digging
<br>
their gardens. A year later, there's all this extra produce from
<br>
Non-Zero-sum Island.
<br>
<p>There's another island where a lone genius with a gun and a machine he
<br>
built himself out of old clams that makes shovels, which he keeps locked
<br>
up. Same story, by the end.
<br>
<p>Now Mike will object that the guy with the shovels would never be so stupid
<br>
as to act this way. He's always rented those shovels out and earned a fair
<br>
slice of the work of the digging guys. Not only that, but on the day the
<br>
digging guys come and take away his shovels they just use them to build
<br>
sand castles and everyone starves.
<br>
<p>Lots of islands, lots of stories.
