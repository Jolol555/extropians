<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>If you are working in a field related to the publishing industry or
<br>
you work in education, then you have one more day to visit the
<br>
Frankfurt (International) Book Fair. Today was the last day for the
<br>
general public to attend. This show the largest book trade show in the
<br>
world.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.frankfurt-book-fair.com/">http://www.frankfurt-book-fair.com/</a>
<br>
<p>The extra security at the show is to search everyone's
<br>
purses/backpacks/briefcases before entering the halls.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Guest of Honour&quot; this year is &quot;Greece&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.frankfurt-book-fair.com/portal-e/fbm-e/griechenland-e/allgemein_griechenland-e/04146/frames.html">http://www.frankfurt-book-fair.com/portal-e/fbm-e/griechenland-e/allgemein_griechenland-e/04146/frames.html</a>
<br>
<p>which is the main reason that I went. 
<br>
<p>In the hall built for this Greek occassion, ~400 publishing companies
<br>
present works on Greece. You can browse through a large collection of
<br>
books on Greece or by Greek authors (languages: about 40% German, 40%
<br>
Greek, 20% English) The Hall also has about a dozen extremely nice
<br>
exhibits presenting every kind communication- Greek style. For
<br>
example: theatre/drama (real costumes and masks from theatre
<br>
performances in the amphitheatres last century, music, publishing-
<br>
here, the major centers of Greek printing through history are
<br>
portrayed (Venice, Forence, Rome, Paris, Geneva, Constantinople,
<br>
etc.), popular Greek ads of the 20th century, modern Greek media-art
<br>
(?), tablet scripts from the 4th and 5th century BC (on loan from the
<br>
Epigraphic Museum of Athens..  fantastic).
<br>
<p>I thought the best Greek exhibit was &quot;The Technology of the Ancient
<br>
Greeks (Hellenistic Period), where you saw: Euclid's elements from
<br>
'Elements of Geometry', a pipe organ (Ktesibios), piston pumps
<br>
(Vitruvius, Philon), Archimedes-screw water pump, demonstration of
<br>
Erastothenes' calculation for the Earth's diameter, Ctesibios' pump
<br>
worked by a windmill, Heron's Aeolipile (like a steam engine), Heron's
<br>
geometrical concepts, Archimedes odometer, Ptolemy's astronomical
<br>
concepts, Ptolemy's maps and astrolabe, and small models of the
<br>
trireme ships that sailed in the Mediterranean for more than a
<br>
thousand years.
<br>
<p>The rest of the trade show (which I didn't get to) featured 
<br>
about 6700 exhibitors. 
<br>
<p>Attached is a news item from the opening day.

<br>
&nbsp;The 53rd Frankfurt Book Fair opened on Tuesday in the presence of 
<br>
&nbsp;Greek President Constantinos Stephanopoulos and the German Minister 
<br>
&nbsp;of Culture, Julian Nida R|melin.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;With close on 6,700 exhibitors from 105 countries, the Frankfurt Book 
<br>
&nbsp;Fair is not just the world's biggest get-together for the 
<br>
&nbsp;international book community, but has traditionally served as a venue 
<br>
&nbsp;for the free exchange of ideas and the meeting of cultures.
<br>
&nbsp;This year, all the opening speeches were preoccupied with the effects 
<br>
&nbsp;of the terror attacks of 11 September in the USA. Nida R|melin, 
<br>
&nbsp;standing in for Germany's Chancellor Gerhard Schrvder who is in the 
<br>
&nbsp;USA, said that the struggle against international terrorism was not a 
<br>
&nbsp;clash between cultures, but a conflict between &quot;those who respect 
<br>
&nbsp;human rights and those who wipe out the lives of innocent bystanders 
<br>
&nbsp;for the sake of political aims.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Book Fair Director Lorenzo A. Rudolf announced that the fair would go 
<br>
&nbsp;on more or less as planned despite the terror acts in the USA. But 
<br>
&nbsp;the atmosphere would &quot;not be one of bustle and routine&quot;, he said.
<br>
&nbsp;Security arrangements at the Book Fair have been tightened up. 
<br>
&nbsp;Despite these difficult circumstances, there have been only a few 
<br>
&nbsp;cancellations. All in all, 54 exhibitors decided at short notice not 
<br>
&nbsp;to come to Frankfurt, among them 31 of the original 792 US American 
<br>
&nbsp;publishing companies.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;It was only in the evening, at the opening of Greece's exhibition as 
<br>
&nbsp;this year's Guest of Honour at the Book Fair, that the tension of the 
<br>
&nbsp;day relaxed into a more festively emotional atmosphere, not least 
<br>
&nbsp;thanks to a moving performance by the famous Greek singer Maria 
<br>
&nbsp;Farantouri.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;The 53rd Frankfurt Book Fair is open to trade visitors and 
<br>
&nbsp;professionals from Wednesday to Friday, to the general public at the 
<br>
&nbsp;weekend and then again for trade visitors on Monday morning.
