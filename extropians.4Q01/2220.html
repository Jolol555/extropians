</em><br>
<p>I like the password &lt;Neptune&gt; - nobody looks for passwords which aren't
<br>
words. Passobjects make a lot of sense, or why not passconcepts?
<br>
<p>It is of course possible to create a distributed password that only
<br>
emerges when enough extropians put together their keys. Unfortunately,
<br>
that means the extropians will afterwards know the secret password. But
<br>
what about a locking device that takes individual keys and if they are
<br>
right opens the door to the secret extropian submarine base? If we
<br>
assume the device is tamper-proof and produces the keys in the first
<br>
place, first generating a public-key pair and then splitting it into the
<br>
keys for the extropians, then it seems that only the device knows the
<br>
key. And of course it can be built to immediately discard the &quot;public&quot;
<br>
key it distributes and only keep the private - that way nobody, not even
<br>
the lock, knows the password. 
<br>
<p>The lock could of course be a human (lets say Max) doing the
<br>
corresponding operations, so it is really possible to have a truly
<br>
secret extropians password which nobody knows (assuming we can get Max
<br>
to forget the public key - a judicious use of scopolamine during the key
<br>
generation will make sure it doesn't get stored in long term memory).
<br>
This way Max can keep the Secret Extropian Word encrypted in his mind
<br>
using the private key, and nobody - neither Max, an insufficient subset
<br>
of extropians or a third party with access to Max's mind - can read it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, just for fun, I'll offer a bounty of $10, payable via Paypal, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first person who can give me the secret Extropian password created by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spike.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt you will ever need to pay it - Spike is *good* at keeping
<br>
silent. I watched in amazement how he dealt with both Greg Burch and
<br>
Mike Lorrey as they were grilling him about what he was working on. Not
<br>
many - if any - bits of information escaped him. 
<br>
<p>Of course, he might not have encrypted his brain yet, so if I can just
<br>
sneak in a sufficiently high powered MRI scanner... :-)
