<br>
Japan's electronics makers are building artificially intelligent robo-pets for
<br>
consumers, but health care workers think the toys have a higher use as
<br>
companions for elderly shut-ins
<br>
<p>Using interactive toys programmed to behave as obsequiously as the average
<br>
lapdog, health care workers are trying to add companionship and emotional
<br>
sustenance that may be missing from the lives of hospitalized children and
<br>
elderly shut-ins. Researchers hope that one day, armies of sharing, caring
<br>
machines will shore up a medical system that is hard-pressed to meet the
<br>
demands of a rapidly aging society. Robots might even serve as surrogate
<br>
family members, providing contact and affection for patients who have no
<br>
immediate relatives nearby.
<br>
<p>In Osaka, 74-year-old Tomoko Komiyama has been participating in a year-long
<br>
human/machine bonding experiment involving a fuzzy, koala-like device called
<br>
Wandakun. The artificial koala two months ago was recalled to the laboratory
<br>
so data could be sifted. But if you ask Komiyama, the experiment has been a
<br>
success. &quot;When I looked into his large brown eyes, I fell in love after years
<br>
of being quite lonely,&quot; says the widow, who lives alone. While Wandakun isn't
<br>
much more interactive than a shrub — it wriggles when petted, sings a bit and
<br>
knows a few phrases — Komiyama considers it a fine housemate. She snuggled up
<br>
with it, talked to it and knitted it sweaters to keep its circuits warm in
<br>
winter. &quot;I swore to protect and care for the little animal,&quot; she says.
<br>
<p>Komiyama gets personal with version 1.0
<br>
<p>Perhaps it's not surprising that the Japanese are taking their well-known
<br>
fondness for high-tech gadgets to a higher emotional plane. The country has
<br>
long been a leader in robotic research; Japanese auto manufacturers pioneered
<br>
their use on assembly lines. Several years ago, electronics giants including
<br>
Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial (maker of Wandakun) concluded that
<br>
artificially intelligent machines were becoming sophisticated enough for the
<br>
general public, as long as they were built to be as cute as house pets. Sony
<br>
has sold more than 110,000 of its AIBO (Artificially Intelligent roBOt)
<br>
robo-dogs since the model was introduced in limited numbers in 1999. Other
<br>
companies have developed A.I. cats, jellyfish and other interactive pets
<br>
ranging in price from several hundred dollars to several thousand.
<br>
<p>Japanese doctors think the growing mechanical menagerie can be put to
<br>
therapeutic use. There is ample research showing that pets improve the
<br>
dispositions of long-term patients — stroking a purring cat demonstrably
<br>
lowers blood pressure, for example. Dr. Akimitsu Yokoyama, a doctor at Yamato
<br>
City Hospital near Tokyo, lobbied for years to introduce pets to its
<br>
pediatrics ward. Administrators nixed the idea, fearing the animals would
<br>
carry infections and trigger allergies.
<br>
<p>Yokoyama reasoned that artificial pets might provide some of the benefits of
<br>
beasts without the mess. The hospital agreed. Since January, Yokoyama has
<br>
presided over weekly play sessions between four AIBOs and young patients at
<br>
the hospital. &quot;I was really amazed by what I saw,&quot; he says. The ward comes
<br>
alive whenever the barking, whining, tail-wagging contraptions are unleashed.
<br>
&quot;The children hug and cuddle the robots, and in the process make friends with
<br>
each other and laugh and play for hours,&quot; says Yokoyama. Patient Daniella
<br>
Marie is fond of her favorite AIBO: &quot;She does all kinds of tricks that make me
<br>
laugh.&quot;
<br>
<p>The children readily accept that the toys, which respond to simple voice
<br>
commands, are worthy of affection, something that surprised Yokoyama. AIBO's
<br>
resemblance to a domesticated animal may be part of the reason. When Yokoyama
<br>
brought a 1.2-meter-tall humanoid robot to the ward, the youngsters kept their
<br>
distance — the metal man apparently looked like he was packing a death ray and
<br>
had the inclination to use it. &quot;Children were afraid of the robot because it
<br>
looked big and strange,&quot; he says. AIBO, on the other hand, looks like a
<br>
cartoon dog.
<br>
<p>Hello Kitty factor aside, Yokoyama is unwilling to concede robo-pets generate
<br>
the same attachment that humans form with fellow vertebrates, which if nothing
<br>
else can supply another heartbeat in the room. &quot;Real pets can help relax
<br>
patients by just sitting with them,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't see the same with
<br>
robots.&quot; Early research suggests he may be wrong — that if it walks like a
<br>
duck and quacks like a duck, even adults will respond as if it were a
<br>
flesh-and-feathers duck. At Tsukuba University in Ibaraki Prefecture, a
<br>
two-month trial that ended in July found a marked drop in stress levels among
<br>
seniors who interacted with an electronic seal called Paro. Researchers noted
<br>
that the elderly test subjects did not face the burden of feeding and tending
<br>
a live sea mammal. &quot;What works best for the elderly is something that they
<br>
enjoy for about an hour each day,&quot; says Takanori Shibata, who heads Tsukuba's
<br>
robot therapy unit.
<br>
<p>Partly due to their low maintenance, some scientists and health care
<br>
professionals see a wider role for robots, especially in long-term care
<br>
facilities. Japan's aging society is putting strains on care delivery. By
<br>
2020, one in four citizens will be more than 65 years old, compared with 17%
<br>
of the country's 127 million residents today. Besides serving as companions
<br>
for the elderly, robots may be called upon to augment dwindling numbers of
<br>
nurses.
<br>
<p>At a new 107-room nursing home being built by Matsushita Electric in Osaka,
<br>
human caregivers will be assisted by teddy bears when the facility opens in
<br>
December. Equipped with sensors, the bear-bots will not only interact with
<br>
residents, they will help the staff monitor their charges, says Kuniichi
<br>
Ozawa, director of Matsushita's nursing care network. Each bear will be linked
<br>
with nurses' stations so that staff can be alerted if, for example, a patient
<br>
does not respond to a robot's electronic greeting. &quot;Robot therapy will be very
<br>
important in care of the elderly in Japan,&quot; says Ozawa, not least because the
<br>
mechanical assistants can reduce labor costs. &quot;It's too expensive to pay
<br>
individual nurses to provide round-the-clock care for each resident. But
<br>
through robots like Tama (a robot tabby developed by Matsushita), they can
<br>
keep an eye on everyone,&quot; says Ozawa.
<br>
<p>To sci-fi fans, the thought of artificial creatures that follow your every
<br>
move is creepily familiar. But skeptics say that robots, no matter how
<br>
sophisticated, will never replace people. &quot;It is important to remember that
<br>
the best care for the elderly is through human touch, which robots cannot
<br>
supply,&quot; says Nobuka Sawada, a professor who teaches welfare for the elderly
<br>
at Saitama University.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, robots could become part of everyday life in Japan. &quot;Japan
<br>
developed a postwar society that worships economic and technological
<br>
development,&quot; says Yokoyama, the Yamato City Hospital doctor. &quot;Therefore it is
<br>
absolutely natural to rely on technology to fill in for the breakdown of
<br>
traditional family roles, which accompanies rapid economic growth in our
<br>
society.&quot;
<br>
<p>Robots may even prove to be better than people as confidants, at least in
<br>
Japan. &quot;Japanese culture encourages people not to show their emotions to each
<br>
other,&quot; says Yokoyama. &quot;So it's actually easier for them to express their
<br>
emotions to a robot — a cold, technological creation.&quot; Hey doc, don't diss the
<br>
artificial beings. You'll hurt their feelings.
<br>
<p>------------------
<br>
<p>&quot;You'll learn to like robots. They'll be
<br>
nicer than human beings.&quot;
<br>

<p>Biology is not destiny. It was never more than tendency. It was just nature's
<br>
first quick and dirty way to compute with meat. Chips are destiny.
