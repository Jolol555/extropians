<em>&gt; Britain, 1770-1870 or thereabouts. It's near as dammit the minarchist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state they keep banging on about. No income tax, night-watchman goverment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a navy (the main military force) than ran at a profit (by enforcing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blockades with confiscation of blockade-runner's assets) and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was a roaring success for business -- but it wasn't a very nice place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for ordinary people to live and it sowed the seeds of its own collapse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clue: the pollution was so bad that massive public works had to be created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deal with it (read up on The Great Stink of 1853 if you don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me). Second clue: social conditions were sufficiently bad that *England*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was where Marx expected the communist revolution to break out. Third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clue: the libertarian &quot;utopia&quot; of imperial Britain was dismantled from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inside out by its own people.
</em><br>
<p>As usual, opponents of the free market are arguing against something
<br>
that doesn't resemble what free-marketers actually want.  That's why
<br>
I tried a few weeks ago to define it--check the archives.  One thing
<br>
I remember very clearly is that a free market demands an effective
<br>
court system that fairly prosecutes torts--including pollution.
<br>
Mounting pollution can only exist on public land--and capitalism
<br>
explicitly rejects the very idea of public land.  &quot;Social problems&quot;
<br>
again are indicative of the absence of capitalism: English courts
<br>
enforced the rights of the upper classes but not the rights of the
<br>
lower classes.  In a capitalist system, a beggar has a much right
<br>
to his dollar as a baron, and the courts enforce that.
