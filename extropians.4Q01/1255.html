Anders said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this a very good point. I fully agree on the basic idea (although 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Robert and I differ on how this interacts with ethics later on). 
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; This is where we appear to diverge ethically. [snip] But this implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that ethically even a very inefficient being that really is a weakest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link has a right to go on with its existence using resources it owns. 
</em><br>
<p>I think the divergence arises of my desire for optimality and/or
<br>
greatest complexity (unentropicity).  Clearly this tends to
<br>
revolve around issues related to consciousness or self-awareness.
<br>
The current moral system seems to grant self-aware humans the
<br>
right to take the lives of presumably non-self-aware animals
<br>
in order to feed themselves.  It also allows you to justifiably
<br>
take the life of even self-aware individuals if they represent
<br>
a threat to your right to life.
<br>
<p>The current moral system seems largely &quot;pre-programmed&quot; as the
<br>
consilience paper by Edward O. Williams points out.  I inherently
<br>
reject a pre-programmed morality or ethical system because there
<br>
is no guarantee that it is optimal or extropic.  Natural evolution
<br>
does not guarantee optimality (I could go into a long tirade about
<br>
photosynthetic efficiency here but I'll save that for another day).
<br>
<p>As the recent James J. Hughes paper from the Jounal of Evolution
<br>
and Technology points out, the fundamental concepts of what
<br>
an &quot;individual&quot; is and what the &quot;rights&quot; of entities with varying
<br>
levels of self-awareness, consciousness, volition, or potential
<br>
to have such (e.g. the cryonically suspended) are -- will be
<br>
undergoing substantial evolution in the not so distant future as
<br>
technologies erode the boxes into which we currently put these concepts.
<br>
We see the tip of the iceberg with regard to this now in the animal
<br>
rights movement.
<br>
<p>My perspective, I think, stems from the fact that I view the fact
<br>
that there seems to be no &quot;guarantee&quot; as to why future sophisticated
<br>
hyperconscious mega-minds will not view unevolved humans the same
<br>
way most humans now view pigs, sheep and cows.  I think Anders
<br>
perspective may stem from the fact that he desires that there be
<br>
a &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;adopted&quot; ethical system in which everyone agrees
<br>
to respect the &quot;natural rights&quot; (such as the right to life) of
<br>
any-&quot;thing&quot; above a certain level.  I think the possibility (or
<br>
probability) that what Anders desires may not be achieved is what
<br>
drives Eliezer towards a Sys-op solution.
<br>
<p>I think democratic societies, particularly those where we increase
<br>
the communication bandwidth between individuals (so I know what you
<br>
know and you know what I know, without years of debates) may approach
<br>
what Anders desires -- because it seems that it will become increasingly
<br>
recognized that it will be the optimal solution for &quot;being more with
<br>
less&quot;.  I also think that in such societies force will not be necessary
<br>
to achieve the optimal results.  If I decide to remain at the butterfly
<br>
level and Anders decides live at the Aristoi level, then as a rational
<br>
butterfly, I would happily turn my matter and energy over to Anders
<br>
for better extropic uses.  Anders would most likely run my butterfly
<br>
life in his simulation out of respect and gratitude for my having
<br>
made the optimal choice.  In a pinch he may time slice my reality
<br>
and run me only for a second every thousand years, but that will
<br>
not really make much of a difference from my subjective viewpoint.
<br>
In the world I envision, the fundamental rights are not the &quot;ownership&quot;
<br>
of matter or energy but the ownership of a &quot;right to exist&quot; in at
<br>
least some form.  We are currently constrained to effectively
<br>
exist in only one form.  As a result we can only develop ethical
<br>
systems that are a poor reflection of what may eventually be possible. 
<br>
<p>So, I do not think my previous proposals were so completely out of
<br>
line as Anders felt.  In the current reality there are clearly
<br>
cases where people are challenging others right to exist and
<br>
acting to achieve their views.  The right of self-defence
<br>
requires that that be stopped.  The fundamental flaws in the
<br>
earlier reasoning were the huge failure to be able to guarantee
<br>
the strategy (leveling Afghanistan) would be successful and
<br>
a poor result value from a moral-utilitarian perspective compared
<br>
with a simple-utilitarian perspective.  That, I think, makes it
<br>
clear why I shouldn't be doing military planning...
<br>
<p>I think this may bring some closure (at least from my perspective)
<br>
to the differing views related to &quot;Extropian morality&quot;.
<br>
<p>Robert
