<p>I don't think this pedantic playing with words is fruitful to
<br>
the discussion. Do you?  The static model of wealth is generally
<br>
not held as realistic by most of the people here.  Also most
<br>
people here believe that increasing technology and particularly
<br>
MNT will eliminate many types of physical scarcity a bit down
<br>
the road and even now many types of supposedly intractable
<br>
shortage have historically been overcome by better tech.  'nuff
<br>

<br>
<p>&lt;long screed about some poor janitor getting screwed over by big
<br>
bad bureaucrats that go through the trouble to bring millions of
<br>
people into the country (with attendant costs) just to pay all
<br>
of them less ignored as rambling and pointless.&gt;
