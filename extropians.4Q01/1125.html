</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; You are wrong about immigrants in general being a plus for America, or for

<em>&gt; just that, but common *emotionally detached* sense will tell you the same

</em><br>
<p>snip another offensive comment...
<br>
<p>While Randy is correct that immigrants in general (legal and illegal)
<br>
not being a plus for America, LEGAL immigrants regularly show that they
<br>
are significant plusses, and those demonizers here should not try to
<br>
construe my (or Randy's ) opinions to be blindly anti-foreigner.
<br>
Immigration controls, properly written and administered, are significant
<br>
contributors to the trust bank which needs to build up for a free
<br>
society to function well. They should NOT discriminate blindly against
<br>
people by their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, etc., but they
<br>
certainly SHOULD have significant merit based filters built in, as well
<br>
as controls that help assure the citizenry that those who are being
<br>
admitted are contributors and worthy of trust as a citizen.
<br>
<p>We are in the situation we are in today specifically because we have
<br>
torn down many of the most useful barriers to entry while keeping many
<br>
of the most inequitable barriers, and have eliminated ANY means of
<br>
keeping track of those let in on a temporary basis.
<br>
<p>I am all for unlimited immigration, but only between high trust
<br>
societies. We should not automatically treat all foreigners as if they
<br>
live in high trust societies. They don't, generally, and 9-11 is
<br>
partially the result of such bad judgement (along with a refusal to
<br>
trust citizens with all of their rights when on an airliner).
<br>
<p>NOTE to Randy: Cut the offensive comments, they make you look worse than
<br>
you are.
