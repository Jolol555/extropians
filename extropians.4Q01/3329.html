</em><br>
<em>&gt; You'd *execute people* because of what they said? Aren't you a fan of

</em><br>
<p>Don't you even see the referents in the statement? In the scenario
<br>
above, *I* am not the government, I am the revolutionary attemting to
<br>
subvert the government. Under revolutionary doctrine, it is in my
<br>
interest to promote the repression of free speech *by the government*,
<br>
so as to bring more support to my side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My revolutionary cabal's plans may even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *require* that such measures be enacted, on the theory that they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engender mistrust and resentment enough to engender further support from

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in arguments of moral equivilancy in order to shround their lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsibility as citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't part of that responsibility enduring that government doesn't get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of hand?  Isn't this about to get -way- out of hand?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that while no one is supporting the terrorists, an awful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of people find the idea of these military courts deeply disturbing.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they do find them disturbing. The only scenario where the
<br>
terrorists win is if those who find them disturbing join the terrorists
<br>
in fighting against the government over this issue. It is a proven fact
<br>
that standard revolutionary insurgency doctrine does not work if a
<br>
sufficient majority of the population trusts the government enough to
<br>
allow it to engage in temporary, targeted, forms of repression that are
<br>
specifically focused on the sources of insurgency.
<br>
<p>We see this occuring in the wake of 911 where you get 80%+ support from
<br>
the african-american community for the profiling of arab/muslim
<br>
individuals by law enforcement. So long as this sort of repression is
<br>
not broad based: i.e. profiling african americans as well, the
<br>
population will support the government actions.
<br>
<p>In insurgency doctrine, the point of triggering massive government
<br>
repression with atrocities is to get the government to oppress enough of
<br>
the population to feed a large growth in participation in
<br>
anti-government activities, which leads to more atrocities by terrorists
<br>
and more repression by government.
<br>
<p>The problem in this calculus of force is in predicting the balance
<br>
between the public perceptions about the atrocities committed by
<br>
terrorists and the proportionality or weightedness of the response by
<br>
government. If the government's repression following the atrocity is
<br>
seen as less severe than the atrocity itself, public support remains
<br>
with the government. A revolutionary needs the government to overreact,
<br>
and for media sources to widely sensationalize any overreaction.
<br>
<p>For this reason, I look at the anthrax attacks with a suspicious view.
<br>
By targeting members of the media, especially those who have records of
<br>
sensationalism and/or sentiment toward left wing anti-government
<br>
opinions, the media has specifically been turned into a tool of
<br>
sensationalism against government into one of its biggest supporters,
<br>
and thus they tend to downplay any repression the government does engage
<br>
in, since in their own biased editorial view, it is at least partially
<br>
justified, if not fully justified.
