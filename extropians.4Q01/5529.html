<p>
Not much time to participate in this thread fully, but let me make a few
<br>
points.
<br>
<p>One, I don't think tax money should be taken at all.  So, there can be
<br>
no moral justification for tax funded aid to Afghanistan.  I did not
<br>
bomb Afghanistan.  Nor did I voluntarily support said bombing.  In fact,
<br>
I've been against the war from the start -- and probably every military
<br>
effort of the US that has happened in my adult life -- e.g., the Persian
<br>
Gulf War and the wars in the Balkans.  (Those who did support the war
<br>
are another matter.  I did not.)
<br>
<p>This does not mean I'm against voluntarily funded charity for
<br>
Afghanistan -- or for anyone for that matter.  There's a world of
<br>
difference between tax-funded aid and voluntary aid.  I think if you're
<br>
really for helping Afghanis -- or anyone for that matter and you have
<br>
the means to do so -- and many on this list are certainly not lacking in
<br>
such -- then such charity is the way to go.  It also allows the givers a
<br>
lot more discretion over how the whole project plays out -- since the
<br>
&quot;exit option&quot; of not funding a given effort is always there.
<br>
(Government foreign aid is veyr different.  You have &quot;veto option&quot; --
<br>
i.e., your vote or lobbying power is really the only way you can change
<br>
how its down.  Good luck with changing the government!:)
<br>
<p>Two, whether money goes to American companies or not is really beside
<br>
the point.  Even so, there are problems with demanding foreign aid go
<br>
specifically to American companies.  This will create a powerful lobby
<br>
to maintain or extend aid in this particular case.  In effect, it will
<br>
become another corporate welfare scheme -- i.e., American taxpayers
<br>
looted to benefit of some American firms.  It might also lead to other
<br>
such schemes in future conflicts as companies line up at the feeding
<br>
trough for foreign aid handouts.  (In fact, the same already happens
<br>
with the Export-Import Bank -- Boeing is the biggest beneficiary and one
<br>
of the loudest lobbiest for it.  BTW, Saudi Arabia is the biggest
<br>
foreign beneficiary of the bank.  The loans the EIB guarantees -- with
<br>
US taxpayer dollars -- are mostly for Boeing to sell planes to the
<br>
Saudis.  Last I heard, the Saudis weren't exactly poor.  Also, the EIB
<br>
generally runs at a loss, so it's even doubtful to say it does more than
<br>
transfer money from the taxpayer to the Boeing.)
<br>
<p>Three, I don't think that foreign aid will necessarily stop terrorism.
<br>
It certainly did not do so in Egypt.  The US doles out billions in
<br>
foreign aid to Egypt, yet most Al Queda terrorists come from Egypt and
<br>
Saudi Arabia.  This doesn't sound like a success story to me.  At the
<br>
very least, how foreign aid is done should be questioned.  You might not
<br>
come away agreeing with me on eliminating foreign aid -- and this goes
<br>
for all countries NOT just the US -- but you will probably want to see
<br>
many changes.  (Whether or not these changes will work is another
<br>
matter.  Merely reforming the system probably will just create new
<br>
winners and losers or make the current winners change their strategies
<br>
to stay winners.)
<br>
<p>Happy New Year to all humanity!
