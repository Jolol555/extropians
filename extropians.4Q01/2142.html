<p>While I'm not sure it is relevant to the conversation, if William Calvin
<br>
is right about the evolution of viewing oneself as an actor in &quot;imagined&quot;
<br>
actions as being important in the rehersal (and perfection) of hunting
<br>
tasks (e.g. throwing), then it seems likely that &quot;consciousness&quot; evolved
<br>
much earlier than Jayne's &quot;bicameral&quot; mind.
<br>
<p>I'm strongly suspicious that there may be a &quot;continuum&quot; of consciousness.
<br>
There would be an evolutionary advantage to any preditor (lions, tigers,
<br>
etc.) being able to mentally reherse its strategies for bringing down
<br>
prey.  In contrast, grazing animals don't gain much by rehersing which
<br>
plants to eat.  The trick that humans may have accomplished is being
<br>
able to bring the rehersal up to the level of self-observation which
<br>
may be associated with our ability to recognize ourselves in the mirror
<br>
experiment.
<br>
<p>If this is correct, then the consciousness may have its roots in
<br>
dreaming in that the incorporation into long term memory of attempts
<br>
that failed or succeeded in reality is necessary for the comparison
<br>
of imaginary rehersals with such prior attempts to determine the
<br>
probability of success (and the decision whether or not to make an attempt).
<br>
<p>It is therefore interesting to consider that multiple future path
<br>
simulations for a superintelligence will be to them what consciousness
<br>
is to us.  While we probably have a difficult time comparing multiple
<br>
outcomes simultaneously, for an SI it would seem to be a relatively
<br>
simple task.
