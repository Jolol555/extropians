<p><em>&gt; Eliezer, amen to your vision of the future!!  I would love to have an intellect equal to you and other extremely bright and educated extropians.  Still, I would need years of study to catch up with you, though.  But, during that time you would all be continuing to learn, grow and implement enhancing cognitive technologies on a level I could not.  So, I would never catch up to you!!  I would be a lot further along then I am now...  A world where we are all equals in mental capacity just does not seem in any way realistic to me even with a singularity having taken place.

<p>Actually, it is a piece of cake.  &quot;All&quot; it would take is
<br>
capturing and reloading informaiton and knowledge from mind to
<br>
mind.  Particularly if the brain is switched to a higher
<br>
capacity and perhaps more easily directly interfaced substrate,
<br>
this is by no means impossible.  Another way it would make no
<br>
difference is if minds linked together in a group mind that was
<br>
one coherent whole. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, despite this disagreement, I like your sentiment for having a world without the glaring deprivation, hatred and inequalities of the present world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; It would be wonderful to have a planet where humanity has put behind its tribalism.  But, if you are an educated person like Mike Lorrey who has suffered from the wonderful new global economy, don't expect an &quot;oh no problem, the future will be just great!&quot; attitude.  In Mike's suffering shoes it would not be so easy to be detached about such matters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But such suffering itself is not necessary if we put our minds
<br>
to doing something about it.

<em>&gt; Tomorrow many people will be celebrating the birth of a man who some say was divine and the prince of peace.  If so(I believe so), he may be showing up just as things get REALLY interesting down here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, we do get a few Chinese curses(blessings).  &quot;May you live
<br>
in interesting times.&quot;  Can't think of any much more
<br>
interesting.
