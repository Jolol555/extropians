<p>
Who has some ideas of possible extropic spinoffs of the terror war? 
<br>
<p>Here's one: cheap launch vehicles.
<br>
<p>The geographic isolation of afghanistan as well as the growing sense of
<br>
opposition to American action against the Taliban and al Qaeda in
<br>
Pakistan and other middle eastern countries could result in the
<br>
elimination of US access to bases in muslim countries, especially if
<br>
governments like those of Musharraff, Mubarak, and the Saudis are
<br>
overthrown by popular rebellion. In such a scenario, and unless Russia
<br>
allows us to use bases in the three 'stans north of Afghanistan, we will
<br>
be reduced to using extreme standoff weapons against the Taliban, with
<br>
no ability to cross normal muslim airspace.
<br>
<p>This development would require the development not only of a ballistic
<br>
delivery system of conventional explosives on guided munitions (simple
<br>
refitting of ICBMs should do the job), but  we would likely also need to
<br>
develop the ability to deploy ballistic transport systems to move men
<br>
and materiel into bases within Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>As a historical analogy, this is much like the situation that developed
<br>
in WWII. Prior to the war, automobiles and air travel were still
<br>
considered luxury items for most Americans, even many solid middle class
<br>
families. It was only after the war, when the vast wartime manufacturing
<br>
infrastructure was converted back to peacetime use, that automobiles and
<br>
airline travel became items that most American families could afford,
<br>
and even two car families started to become common, and business
<br>
travellers found airline travel to be a common occurence.
<br>
<p>Similarly, if we are forced to develop the infrastructure for massive
<br>
ballistic transport of men and materiel for this war, the postwar period
<br>
would likely result in the popularization of cheap space travel for
<br>
common people.
