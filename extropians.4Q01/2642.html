<p>New Vedic City Aims to Create Ideal Municipality
<br>
<p>Residents Voted &quot;Yes&quot; on Referendum to Incorporate in state of Iowa
<br>
A new city dedicated to creating maximum health, well-being and success
<br>
for its inhabitants was approved by residents in a vote late last month.
<br>
Located 2 miles north of Fairfield in southeast Iowa, Vedic City is
<br>
Iowa's first new city since 1982 and the 950th city in the state.
<br>
<p>Vedic City is the first city in the modern world to be based entirely on
<br>
the ancient principles of Maharishi Sthapatya-Veda® design and other
<br>
aspects of Maharishi Vedic Science. &quot;Veda&quot; is the Sanskrit word meaning
<br>
knowledge. Rogers Badgett, one of the city's developers, said Maharishi
<br>
Vedic Science is comprised of 40 approaches, including architecture,
<br>
community planning, health care, education, music, agriculture, etc. Its
<br>
goal, he said, is to bring the life of the individual and society in
<br>
tune with the laws of nature and thus gain support of natural law for
<br>
every undertaking.
<br>
<p>State of Iowa Approved Petition to Incorporate
<br>
Earlier this year, the State of Iowa City Development Committee approved
<br>
a petition to incorporate the 654-acre site for the new city. The area
<br>
currently has over 40 buildings, including The Raj, a nationally known
<br>
health spa and clinic based on Maharishi Vedic Medicine, two hotels,
<br>
many businesses, housing developments, condominiums, and a Vedic
<br>
observatory. More than $30 million has already been spent on development.
<br>
<p>Maharishi Vedic Science Programs Attract Families
<br>
Over the last 27 years, more than 2,000 individuals and families from
<br>
across the US have moved to the neighboring city of Fairfield to take
<br>
advantage of the programs offered by Maharishi University of Management.
<br>
Founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the University integrates the study of
<br>
traditional academic disciplines with the practical technologies of
<br>
Maharishi Vedic Science to develop the students' full potential.
<br>
<p>&quot;Vedic City will provide this Vedic knowledge to its citizens in every
<br>
aspect of their lives and will provide visitors access to Maharishi
<br>
Sthapatya-Veda designed hotels, health clinics, and other amenities so
<br>
they can also experience improved health and well-being,&quot; said Bob
<br>
Wynne, a Vedic City developer.
<br>
<p>Incorporation of Vedic City will allow financing such as general
<br>
obligation bonds that will help the new city to create necessary
<br>
infrastructure and municipal services.
<br>
<p>The city is projected to grow from 125 to several thousand permanent
<br>
residents within a few years and to attract many more to its hotels,
<br>
clinics, and other amenities.
<br>
<p>For more information, please call 641-469-7000.
<br>
<p>Overview of the Unique Components of Vedic City
<br>
&quot;The goal of every community should be to promote the highest level of
<br>
health, happiness and success for its citizens,&quot; said Vedic City
<br>
developer Rodgers Badgett. &quot;The profound insights of Maharishi Vedic
<br>
Science give us a comprehensive framework for enlightened living. This
<br>
city will set the standard for all other cities.&quot;
<br>
<p>Maharishi Sthapatya-Veda
<br>
This science of healthy buildings and enlightened community planning
<br>
includes recommendations for building and street orientation, room
<br>
placement and dimensioning, landscaping, building materials, etc. Vedic
<br>
City and its buildings are built in accord with these principles.
<br>
<p>Maharishi Vedic Medicine
<br>
Maharishi Vedic Medicine programs provide knowledge and techniques to
<br>
unfold the inner intelligence of the body. The Raj, currently a central
<br>
amenity of Vedic City, has already gained an international reputation
<br>
for its success in addressing a wide range of chronic disorders.
<br>
<p>In addition, developers of the new city donated 58 acres to Maharishi
<br>
University of Management for the construction of the UniversityÕs
<br>
College of Maharishi Vedic Medicine, which recently received $7.9
<br>
million in grants from the National Institutes of Health. The College's
<br>
Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention is one of 12 specialized
<br>
centers of research in complementary and alternative medicine in the
<br>
country sponsored by the NIH.
<br>
<p>Consciousness-based Education
<br>
The new city is just down the highway from Maharishi University of
<br>
Management and the Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment (K-12).
<br>
Accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the
<br>
University offers bachelors, masters, and Ph.D. programs in the
<br>
sciences, arts, and humanities and integrates Maharishi Vedic Science
<br>
into its curriculum. Research on the University students has shown
<br>
improved brain functioning, increased IQ and creativity, less anxiety
<br>
and stress and improved health, all fundamental components of a
<br>
successful education. Students at the K-12 school consistently score in
<br>
the top 1% on standardized achievement tests and have won more than 70
<br>
state titles in the past decade. Twenty-five percent of the students in
<br>
last year's graduating class were National Merit scholars and finalists.
<br>
<p>Maharishi Vedic Observatory
<br>
Ancient observatories are found in almost every country in the world
<br>
either as physical remains or a myth or legend - Stonehenge in England,
<br>
Maachupichu in Peru, and observatories in Mexico, China, Egypt, and
<br>
India. The Maharishi Vedic Observatory, which sits on two acres
<br>
centrally located in Vedic City, consists of ten full-size working
<br>
astronomical instruments based upon ancient designs. The precise
<br>
measuring instruments of the observatory reflect in their form and
<br>
function the movement of the stars and planets with relation to the
<br>
individual, and display this mathematical relationship.
<br>
<p>Coherence-Creating Group Meditation
<br>
Every morning and afternoon Vedic City residents create a harmonious
<br>
influence in the environment through their group practice of the
<br>
Transcendental Meditation® and TM-Sidhi® program, including Yogic
<br>
Flying, in the Golden Domes of Maharishi University of Management.
<br>
Rodgers Badgett said, &quot;The desire to create perfect health and a
<br>
peaceful world and to unfold our full potential is the shared priority
<br>
of everyone in this community. It's the purpose of Vedic City.&quot;
