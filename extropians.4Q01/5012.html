<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 54'th update of my fly longevity experiments. All bottles
<br>
contain 1/4 tsp citric acid as a standard additive. Recorded average
<br>
temperature during the experiment was 25.3 C.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this experiment I seek to further examine rice products, as well as
<br>
soy protein. I did not expect rice bran to be beneficial since it contains
<br>
a lot of fat, and all tested fats have reduced fly longevity in published
<br>
experiments. However since rice polishings have at least some fat in them
<br>
I decided to test rice bran anyhow. A relatively new breeding bottle was
<br>
used, with a lot of young, fairly healthy flies.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rice bran turned out to be positive early in the experiment, but
<br>
neutral later on. The early results could be due to chance. Rice
<br>
polishings and rice protein turned out to be beneficial only during the
<br>
first month. Soy protein
<br>
exerted a beneficial effect throughout the experiment. This is consistant
<br>
with a powerful protective effect against some viruses. However at the day
<br>
58 census, neither of the two remaining control flies could fly, while
<br>
several could still do so in some of the other bottles. Soy and rice may
<br>
exert a small retarding effect on motor neuron degeneration.
