<p>Mass Extinctions May Be A Myth, Claim Scientists
<br>
<p>London - Nov 13, 2001
<br>
<p>Catastrophic mass extinctions, such as the one that saw the demise of the
<br>
dinosaurs,could be a myth according to the findings of recent research into
<br>
100 million-year-old marine fossils.
<br>
<p>It is widely believed that there has been about a dozen mass extinctions
<br>
during the history of life on Earth, the most devastating of which saw 84%
<br>
of the planet's species disappear.
<br>
<p>But research by geologist Professor Andy Gale of the University of Greenwich
<br>
and palaeontologists from the Natural History Museum, published recently in
<br>
the American journal Paleobiology, is now casting doubt upon whether these
<br>
mass extinctions took place.
<br>
<p>&quot;Large gaps in the fossil record are often cited as evidence of mass
<br>
extinctions. But there are other explanations for this lack of fossil
<br>
evidence which do not point to a catastrophic annihilation of large numbers
<br>
of species, says Professor Gale.
<br>
<p>&quot;During the Cretaceous period (146 to 65 million years ago), dominated by
<br>
dinosaurs, there were periods of intense global warming which saw dramatic
<br>
rises in sea levels so severe that the oceans flooded Europe, turning it
<br>
into an archipelago of little islands. This forced shallow marine species
<br>
and land animals to migrate from their usual habitats.
<br>
<p>&quot;Once the sea level dropped again these species migrated back with it, and
<br>
the fossil record laid down in sedimentary rock during those periods of high
<br>
sea level was largely destroyed over time by wind, rain and glacial
<br>
erosion,&quot; continued Professor Gale.
<br>
<p>&quot;The interruption in the fossil record during these periods was caused by
<br>
species migration and the loss of the fossil record of that migration, and
<br>
not by a mass extinction.&quot;
<br>
<p>Evidence of these &quot;pseudoextinctions&quot; can be seen in the fossil record of
<br>
the chalk cliffs at Dover in Kent and Beachy Head on the Sussex coast. Many
<br>
of the shallow water organisms which disappeared from the fossil record in
<br>
these cliffs, 100 to 95 milllion years ago, reappeared millions of years
<br>
later when sea levels fell.
<br>
<p>&quot;It initially appears from the fossil record contained within these cliffs
<br>
that marine species during this period suffered extinction rates of up to
<br>
70%,&quot; says Professor Gale.
<br>
<p>&quot;But the reality is that the reappearance of the majority of these species
<br>
indicates that they were simply displaced to other areas by rising sea
<br>
levels, and then returned, without suffering significant extinction. Taking
<br>
this into account, the extinction rate during this period falls to 17%, a
<br>
level that inevitably occurs at any time.
<br>
<p>&quot;Based on the fossil evidence we have analysed, we believe that there was no
<br>
mass extinction 100 million years ago, as previously thought,&quot; concludes
<br>
Professor Gale.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is also probable that many of the other mass extinctions that were
<br>
thought to have taken place during the history of life on Earth either did
<br>
not happen or have been greatly exaggerated.&quot;
