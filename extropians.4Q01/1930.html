<em>&gt;&gt; So why trust it with ever more power?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because it would appear that increasing our own morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or freedom) in a world where others lack such morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or freedom) recently killed 5000 people.
</em><br>
<p>Whoa!  I seem to recall significantly more deaths from the government,
<br>
especially in shorter periods of time.  The civilians in Dresden, Hiroshima,
<br>
and Nagasaki -- to mention wartime deaths -- for example.  Your argument
<br>
would be much stronger if a) the governments hands were not so bloody from
<br>
its own killing sprees in both peace and war and b) the governments
<br>
activities had not relation to terrorism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; History clearly shows how we have botched the job (forgetting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Afghanistan as soon as the Soviets pulled out and focusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead on Iraq).
</em><br>
<p>Some -- e.g., Ted Galen Carpenter who warned about Afghanistan in the early
<br>
1990s -- would say the US government -- not &quot;we&quot;; you're not part of the
<br>
Administration or the Pentagon; Bush doesn't have you on speaker phone when
<br>
he's with the NSC or his cabinet!:) -- &quot;botched the job&quot; by getting involved
<br>
at all.  The Soviets weren't exactly have a grand old time before the US
<br>
government started giving money and weapons to the Pakistani government to
<br>
train and arm &quot;freedom fighters.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I'm pessimistic that *anything* we do now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will turn out well.  However living in a democratic society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have to realize the fate of politicians who argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we should take the hit on withdrawal from our oil addiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its political suicide.  The bottom line is that one can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;manage&quot; the disaster as best you can and hope technology will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dig us out of our hole before it all goes to hell.
</em><br>
<p>I want to strike at the heart of the problem: government.  If you don't,
<br>
then don't expect the disease to go away when you just treat the symptoms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Does anyone seriously think it will not abuse these new powers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, a better question is, will such abuses extend the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longevity of the average law-abiding citizen?
</em><br>
<p>I think Franklin had it right here -- about trading freedom for security,
<br>
that is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We are holding ~1000 people now on various minor charges associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the WTC attacks.
</em><br>
<p>Did this require sweeping new powers be given to the government?  Were they
<br>
only arrested this afternoon?  Or right after the bill was signed by Bush?:)
<br>
Do tell!
<br>
<p>Cheers!
