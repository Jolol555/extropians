<p>The capabilities have become extremely complicated at this point.
<br>
I am reasonably sure that it depends on precisely what paper by
<br>
specific groups one cites to determine what one is talking about.
<br>
<p>- Cloning via nuclear transfer from adults seems feasible.
<br>
- Cloning via parthenogenesis in eggs (at least in primates) seems
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;feasible.  (Note that you have no fertilization as well as the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;potential for harmful gene penetrance here).
<br>
- Cloning via parthenogeneis after the transfer of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nuclei (chromosomes?) into denucleated eggs from one or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;two sperm may be possible.
<br>
- Cloning via transfer of nuclei into eggs of a different
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;species still seems open to question (???).
<br>
<p>The reliability of these methods and the viability of offspring
<br>
still remain very open questions.
<br>
<p>Bottom line is -- if you can produce something that produces
<br>
totipotent stem cells you have probably produced something that could
<br>
grow into an embryo/fetus (if implanted [with current technology]).
<br>
The nuclei of any cell (except red blood cells) in the human body
<br>
can produce another human being *if* you know what genes to turn
<br>
off/on to restart the cycle of development (and you can find an
<br>
environment that can support that development).  We don't know
<br>
what those genes are yet *but* at some point we will.
