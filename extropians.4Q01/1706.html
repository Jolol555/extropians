Lee Crocker writes, quoting Hal:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Suppose we lived in a world in which copy protection of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could be achieved....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then I would propose that this would lead to the optimal allocation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resources for the production of information and other goods....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So how do you propose to measure the immense loss of valuable goods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from those people who would have made use of a larger public domain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of art and ideas to create, but who were priced out?
</em><br>
<p>They wouldn't be &quot;priced out&quot; if the goods they could have created were
<br>
really of such immense value.  The funds they would receive from selling
<br>
their valuable goods would allow them to purchase the information they
<br>
needed for production.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumes that &quot;creative&quot; works appear ex nihilo, and that they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some inherent value, both of which I can't agree with.
</em><br>
<p>No, I was basing my argument on the assumption that information goods
<br>
can be treated like other private goods in economics.  This does not
<br>
involve assuming that the goods appear out of nowhere, or that they have
<br>
inherent value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works are worthless.  They only have value when there is demand, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can only create demand by exposure to similar works or to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products or research.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree that demand for creative works arises _only_ from exposure
<br>
to similar works.  But I don't think that point is relevant here.
<br>
To the extent that it's true, it applies to many physical goods as well.
<br>
Demand for commonplace items like clothing, furniture and cars is
<br>
influenced by exposure to similar works.  This does not differentiate
<br>
information goods from physical goods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for patents, it is very likely that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people best able to make good products from an invention, and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best able to market those products, are not the inventors or those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hired by the inventors.
</em><br>
<p>Those people who are best able to exploit an invention are the ones who
<br>
would be able to afford to bid the most for the rights to it.  This is
<br>
standard market economics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By limiting the use of the invention to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;authorized&quot; uses, you effective shut out the imaginations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billions of people who might have come up with better uses for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea, or slightly better crafted products, or slightly derivative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works of great value.
</em><br>
<p>If these people can really be productive with the patent, the holder
<br>
will have an incentive to offer them a license, and they will be able
<br>
to afford to pay his license fees.
<br>
<p>To reiterate, market economics predicts that excludable private goods will
<br>
be optimally produced by society.  Information goods are special in that
<br>
their marginal costs of production are extremely low, practically zero.
<br>
That does not invalidate the reasoning which shows that society will
<br>
maximize its wealth under a market system with private goods.
<br>
