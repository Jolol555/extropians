From: &quot;Alex F. Bokov&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alexboko@umich.edu?Subject=Re:%20Anthrax%20addendum.&In-Reply-To=&lt;045001c155e6$cabce2a0$6a5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">alexboko@umich.edu</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; What if we don't pay politicians anymore AND have no more entangling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alliances?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;don't pay politicians&quot;? Good idea!! How do you propose to evade paying taxes
<br>
(which are used to pay politicians)? As for entangling alliances... I guess
<br>
they go with the territory, no matter where the territory is, and no matter
<br>
how small the territory. Office politics infect even small businesses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Granted, but as a tax payer
</em><br>
<p>There you go... you're paying politicians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm forced to foot part of this cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of how many petroleum products I actually consume.
</em><br>
<p>If you buy petroleum products, you pay the extra excise tax collected at the
<br>
pump or point of sale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies should contract for their own defense (or better,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitration), with the US government if they wish, but why pay tax $$$
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this?
</em><br>
<p>That's a wonderful idea, and many people have suggested it. The trouble is
<br>
that governments would never allow private sector corporate entities to
<br>
_openly_ arbitrate for their own defense. Of course, the good 'ol
<br>
&quot;military-industrial complex&quot; never let that stop them from getting in cahoots
<br>
with government, but then, in the US the government and industry are savvy
<br>
enough to know that they are two sides of the same coin, and that coin means
<br>
economic stability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a thought experiment, what if we just stopped having a foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy for a decade or so?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, you mean like re-instate the Clinton administration? ©¿©¬
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No foreign aid, no interventions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; withdrawing all our military personnel and equipment into the confines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our borders?
</em><br>
<p>Well, that sounds good to me, but the US government wouldn't go for it,
<br>
because it would mean that a huge part of government would be out of jobs, and
<br>
consequently the liberals (aka, socialists) wouldn't go for it because it
<br>
would reduce the size of government, which is something they want to avoid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * and its Jihad.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Better yet, just say: The only good Wahhabi is a dead Wahhabi.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
