<p>Oceans Could Be Common In Our Solar System And Others
<br>
<p>Oceans might be common and diverse in our solar system and in other solar systems, according to David Stevenson of Caltech, who regards the old notion of a narrow &quot;habitable zone&quot; (Venus too hot, Mars too cold, Earth just right) for liquid water oceans as erroneous. 
<br>
Stevenson spoke last week in San Francisco at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union at a session intended to bring together two scientific communities that scrutinize very different realms -- the planets and the seafloor on Earth. 
<br>
<p>The connection? 
<br>
<p>Observations from the bottom of the ocean show that microbes thrive both in near-freezing seawater and in near-boiling effusions from thermal vents. These conditions might turn up in many other planetary environments. 
<br>
<p>For example, the Galileo spacecraft has provided evidence for watery oceans on three of Jupiter's moons -- Callisto, Ganymede, and Europa. Subsurface oceans could be kept liquid by warmth from tidal forces (Jove wringing its satellites) or from radioactivity. 
<br>
<p>Torrance Johnson of JPL, also speaking at the meeting, said that Europa's ocean might be 75-150 km thick and could thus harbor twice the water in Earth's oceans. Stevenson added that observations also hint at oceans on Titan, Triton, and Pluto. 
<br>
<p>In the case of Titan (soon to get the Galileo treatment when the Cassini spacecraft reaches Saturn in 2004), an ocean would be a mixture of water and ammonia (acting as antifreeze). Under some circumstances, water might even be found inside Uranus and Neptune.
