JR forwards a review of:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Brave New Brain: Conquering Mental Illness in the Era of the Genome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nancy C Andreasen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7322/1192/a">http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7322/1192/a</a>
</em><br>
<p>I heard something interesting on this topic last weekend.  We attended
<br>
New Student Parents' Day at Caltech where my son is a freshman, which
<br>
happens to also be where both I and my wife Fran went to school.
<br>
There were a number of presentations, one by the various professors
<br>
who teach freshman science classes.  The biology teacher seemed to be
<br>
an especially good teacher, an entertaining and interesting speaker.
<br>
The talk he gave went something like this:
<br>
<p>His goal in teaching introductory biology was to introduce the students
<br>
to what he feels is going to be the most important revolution in the
<br>
biological sciences in the next few decades.  That is the increased
<br>
understanding of the brain and associated increase in treatments for
<br>
diseases of the brain and mental illness.  Unfortunately he has found
<br>
that college freshman have very little interest in studying diseases,
<br>
since they generally consider themselves immortal.  An additional problem
<br>
is that most students taking this class are physics and engineering
<br>
majors, who generally take the view that biology reduces to physics by
<br>
first principles and is not very interesting.  So he has to trick the
<br>
freshmen by starting with biophysics and showing how single-molecule
<br>
interactions can lead to interesting biological behavior.  This leads into
<br>
the study of biological pathways within the cell, chemical messengers,
<br>
neurotransmitters, and finally they are into brain pathology where he
<br>
wanted to lead them.
<br>
<p>It was a good talk and I was hopeful that my son would enjoy his class.
<br>
Not all of the teachers were so engaging.  Fran actually had known
<br>
this teacher, as she was a biology major when she was in college.
<br>
He does specialize in brain biology so presumably his ideas about what
<br>
areas of research are going to be most important are somewhat biased.
<br>
I was surprised, with all we hear about the genome and cures for cancer,
<br>
etc., that he would describe brain research as having the most potential
<br>
for important discoveries.
<br>
<p>But from an Extropian perspective a greater understanding of the brain
<br>
might lead to more than just cures for disease.  We could gain an
<br>
understanding of how to use our brains more effectively, and if the
<br>
taboos can be overcome, begin to know what genetic and environmental
<br>
factors influence intelligence levels.  Any research which can improve
<br>
the efficiency of our most important organ, the brain, has the potential
<br>
to be truly revolutionary.
