<em>&gt; This is an interesting article describing how for a long time the Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world was the center of science and learning, and how it probably fueled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the renaissance.
</em><br>
<p>I wish for my edification that the article had mentioned Islamic/Chinese
<br>
exchange.  I'd expect such to be significant given that both cultures
<br>
were more advanced in many ways than Christiandom during the time
<br>
periods covered.
<br>
<p>The article really doesn't credit Islamic science with much
<br>
originality, mainly stressing that Islamic scholars had much better
<br>
access to Greek knowledge than did their European peers.
<br>
<p>This bit &quot;Islam is one of the few religions in human history in
<br>
which scientific procedures are necessary for religious ritual ...
<br>
The requirement that Muslims face in the direction of Mecca when
<br>
they pray, for example, required knowledge of the size and shape
<br>
of the Earth. The best astronomical minds of the Muslim world
<br>
tackled the job of producing tables or diagrams by which the qibla,
<br>
or sacred directions, could be found from any point in the Islamic
<br>
world. Their efforts rose to a precision far beyond the needs of
<br>
the peasants who would use them&quot; seems wrong.  What about the
<br>
intricate measurements done by the Egyptians, Mayans, and builders
<br>
of Stonehenge, to name just a few?
<br>
<p>The most provocative paragraph in the article isn't followed up
<br>
on:  'Others argue, however, that Islamic science seems to decline
<br>
only when viewed through Western, secular eyes. &quot;It's possible to
<br>
live without an industrial revolution if you have enough camels
<br>
and food,&quot; Dr. King said.'
