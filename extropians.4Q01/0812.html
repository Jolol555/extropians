I was unaware of the gene migration issue Harvey pointed out
<br>
and he is to some extent correct, that there may be concerns with 
<br>
this problem that merit regulations to address it.  However, I'd
<br>
counter it with the fact that I expect us to be able to engineer
<br>
genomes with altered genetic codes, perhaps within the next
<br>
decade, that effectively eliminate that problem.  From my perspective,
<br>
in the time it will take for the problem to become a serious concern,
<br>
our abilities will have developed solutions to it.  (And yes I know
<br>
most people probably are sufficiently unaware of this process to
<br>
accept that argument without a very long paper to back it up.)
<br>
<p>Anders has made a good case for the greater efficiency of open
<br>
societies and pretty much squashed the &quot;enlightened despot&quot;
<br>
concept of the Aristoi.
<br>
<p>So I think the problem may be with the generality of my proposal.
<br>
Some more specific examples and clay pigeon solutions follow.
<br>
<p>Lets assume there is a web site that lists all of the locations
<br>
of nuclear power plants in the U.S.  Lets assume that terrorists
<br>
seek to use this information for terrorist acts.  Can a case
<br>
be made that there are benefits associated with this &quot;free&quot;
<br>
information that exceed the risks posed by having it free?
<br>
Sure, terrorists can find the locations of nuclear power
<br>
plants by searching the archives of local newspapers --
<br>
but that will take more time.  By minimizing ease of access
<br>
to &quot;sensitive&quot; information (e.g. building plans) or requiring
<br>
that people demonstrate a &quot;need to know&quot; (i.e. you are an
<br>
architect with a contract to design offices for the 6th floor)
<br>
you retard the ability of terrorists achieve the greatest
<br>
results with the least investment.
<br>
<p>Similarly, should students enrolling in classes involving
<br>
nuclear physics or molecular biology be required to undergo
<br>
interviews to ascertain their motives? Or if they are foriegn
<br>
students should their names be forwarded to government agencies
<br>
so they may be monitored?  (Note that this isn't foolproof
<br>
since at least one person on the terrorist most-wanted list
<br>
was a U.S. citizen.)
<br>
<p>We *do* in Western societies accept the &quot;meritocracy&quot; argument
<br>
to a certain degree.  Only people with the proper degrees,
<br>
who have passed the required exams demonstrating their competancy
<br>
are allowed to practice medicine, law, drive trucks, fly planes,
<br>
etc.  This makes sense because people who &quot;malpractice&quot; in these
<br>
professions have the possibility of seriously harming other
<br>
individuals.  Most branches of science have not had similar
<br>
requirements.  Should that begin to change?
<br>
<p>There are restrictions on the professions that people who experience
<br>
epileptic fits may practice (because the loss of control of their
<br>
body can present a danger to others).  Presumably suicidal terrorists
<br>
have &quot;lost control&quot; of a rational (or perhaps a &quot;social&quot;) mind -- to
<br>
what degree should one regulate (or at least track) information that
<br>
such individuals have had access to?  Data mining can easily demonstrate
<br>
&quot;unusual&quot; information access patterns.
<br>
<p>I've taken sufficient courses that with sufficient financial
<br>
resources, I could easily design a nasty bioweapon.  I'm
<br>
moderately confident that given the resources and material
<br>
I could also design a nuclear weapon.  I'm a case in point
<br>
of an individual whose motives should be &quot;certified&quot; before
<br>
one granted me access to university laboratories. 
<br>
<p>I don't think one should entirely restrict access to information.
<br>
I do think a lot more thought needs to be devoted to determining
<br>
that it is indeed going to be utilized responsibly.
<br>
