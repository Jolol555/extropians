<em>&gt;     &gt;She is a technologically savvy person [...]  So, I differ with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Samantha
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      &gt;on a number of issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alex I respect you so when you say Samantha has some good qualities I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it must be true. I also think politeness is a worthwhile virtue but to say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with her is putting it so mildly, so apathetically, as to be completely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;misleading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some people are trying to kill me, an effort is being made to stop them but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Samantha says that effort should stop immediately. That just makes my blood 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;She may be a technologically savvy person but on this issue I repeat what I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;she is a blithering idiot. I would never get this angry if we were arguing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technical question or even over politics, but this issue is not something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abstract,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it involves my survival and I take it personally.
</em><br>
<p>What is the purpose of repeatedly calling her a &quot;blithering idiot?&quot;  
<br>
Everyone on the list is very, very clear where you stand concerning 
<br>
Samantha's views.  As I see it you are either (1) resorting to rudeness in 
<br>
the hope of somehow getting Samantha to see the error of her ways or (2) you 
<br>
are trying to influence others on the list to share your opinion that 
<br>
Samantha is idiotic.
<br>
<p>Either way, repeatedly calling her an idiot will not serve your purposes and 
<br>
will only increase the level of animosity and decrease the level of civility 
<br>
and collegiality on this list.  Conclusion: your rudeness is degrading the 
<br>
value of this list.  Please consider simply plonking Samantha or, at least, 
<br>
keeping your elementary school comments to yourself.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
