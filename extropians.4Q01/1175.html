<em>&gt; &gt;Ahemmm!  I think I will speak to this question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I believe that I am a 12th generation American citizen (those on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the list who can trump that (native Americans excepted) please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;feel free to do so).  Rafal, would I believe, be considered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;0th generation American.  Yet I find myself siding more with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Rafal than with Randy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This issue has NOTHING to do with genealogy! It has to do with long term future of this country, and the short term future of our wallets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for myself, I have American ancestors going back to ~ 12000 BP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, as someone else pointed out, West European genes have been found in very very old Americans, and they probably were here in America around 20000 BP.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, someone said that there were caucasians here before the
<br>
present 'natives' arrived ~9000 years ago. Caucasians are not western
<br>
european in origin, they originate from the Altai/Caucasus/Baikal region
<br>
of central asia, and only migrated west (and east to NA, it seems) due
<br>
to pressure from a mongoloid expansion from China and SE asia. Said
<br>
North American caucasians had more in common with the aboriginal Ainu
<br>
people of the Japanese island of Hokkaido than with those that wound up
<br>
in Scandinavia
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The &quot;Extropian Game&quot; is *NOT* &quot;horde the wealth&quot;.  The Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Game is to spin the wheel and promote complexification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Extropy game is *supposed* to be about keeping our precious brain matter from the ravages of Entropy....
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Live free or die, death is not the worst of evils&quot;
<br>
<p>While living forever is an extropic ethic, it is not only not the only
<br>
ethic, it is not necessarily the highest one. Individual liberty and
<br>
self determination / self improvement are the higher individual extropic
<br>
ethics. Living forever is merely one option an individual extropian may
<br>
choose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Randy's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;points are ill-suited for the Extropian list unless he makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;clear and falsifiable arugment that the admission of &quot;educated&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;immigrants over &quot;uneducated&quot; immigrants will clearly promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a greater rate of complexification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you cross the street and see a bus bearing down on you, do you postpone running until an &quot;clear and falsifiable argument&quot; is presented that the bus will run you down unless you hustle your butt to the sidewalk?
</em><br>
<p>Not quite the right analogy. More like: When you see a bus run down one
<br>
of your associates in the streets, and the driver says &quot;You are next!&quot;,
<br>
do you postpone running/shooting out the wheels/EMPing the engine until
<br>
you have a clear, falsifiable, and independently verifiable argument
<br>
that the driver actually meant to do what he did and really means to do
<br>
the same to you?
<br>
<p>The above analogy applies more to the present terrorist situation,
<br>
though. On immigration in general, it is more a matter of a ship at sea,
<br>
rescuing people who are abandoning sinking ships. You could rescue
<br>
everybody, but that would capsize your own ship and then nobody would
<br>
have anyplace to turn. Each individual floating in the sea obviously
<br>
thinks it is perfectly reasonable and fair that the ship can surely
<br>
accomodate just one more person (them, of course) and that they don't
<br>
mean any harm to anybody.
<br>
<p>Now, while you are floating around rescuing people, you have the people
<br>
already on board furiously working to build the hull to have larger
<br>
displacement capacity, larger water processing capacity, and more food,
<br>
decking, cabin space, etc. You obviously want to keep the rate of new
<br>
construction ahead of the rate of rescuing, so you don't fall behind and
<br>
have to start functioning on a more scarce economy for each individual.
<br>
<p>The problem is that some of the people you are rescuing are coming from
<br>
ships that sank because those people either neglected the maintenance of
<br>
their ship, were unable to do so, or had a hand in its destruction, and
<br>
when they arrive on board your ship, they either contribute nothing to
<br>
the expansion of your ship's capacity while soaking up resources, or
<br>
they contribute less than they consume, or they take an active role in
<br>
destroying the capacity of the ship.
<br>
<p>How do you determine who is going to be a positive contributing member
<br>
of the crew and who is going to be a detriment? Do you just let
<br>
everybody on board and hope for the best, or do you impose filters that
<br>
try to determine how each individual is going to behave and check on the
<br>
actions of those new crewmembers until you are satisfied they are
<br>
positive contributors, while deporting those who don't fit your filters,
<br>
and those who turn out to have misrepresented themselves?
