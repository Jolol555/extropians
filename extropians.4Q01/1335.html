Eliezer's pointer to <a href="http://www.scitechdaily.com/">http://www.scitechdaily.com/</a> led me to an
<br>
interview with Stephen Wolfram at
<br>
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/opinion/opinterview.jsp?id=ns230516">http://www.newscientist.com/opinion/opinterview.jsp?id=ns230516</a>.
<br>
Wolfram, best known as the author of the Mathematica program for symbolic
<br>
calculation, has a book coming out in a few months which he claims could
<br>
revolutionize science.
<br>
<p>&quot;A New Kind of Science&quot; proposes an alternative to the mathematical
<br>
modeling which has been the main tool for scientific analysis since the
<br>
time of Newton.  Equations and formulas use simple rules and operations
<br>
like addition and multiplication, and are a good fit for some physical
<br>
phenomena, but don't work for others.  Wolfram believes that there are
<br>
alternatives to equations which can provide an entirely new toolset
<br>
for the scientist.  These would be based on cellular automata, arrays
<br>
of computers running extremely simple programs.  As with mathematical
<br>
equations, you can have a simple model and produce complex results.
<br>
Wolfram argues in his book that CAs may be as good or better than
<br>
equations for modeling nature.
<br>
<p>Wolfram is quite a character.  His web site, www.stephenwolfram.com,
<br>
has excerpts from the new book as well as the story of his life.  A real
<br>
prodigy, Wolfram, born in 1959, got his PhD by age 20 in theoretical
<br>
physics.  After doing original work in particle physics, his attention
<br>
turned in the 1980s to the problems of chaos and complexity in physical
<br>
phenomena.  He got interested in CAs and was one of the founders of the
<br>
study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory which became such a fad in
<br>
the 1980s.
<br>
<p>At the end of the 80s he decided to commercialize his software
<br>
package SMP which was used for computer algebra.  I believe I used an
<br>
early version of SMP when I was a student at Caltech in the 1970s.
<br>
This became Mathematica, which has been a huge success and has made
<br>
Wolfram a multi-millionaire.
<br>
<p>In the early 1990s his attention turned back to his work on CAs.
<br>
He felt that his deeper points about the importance of this study had
<br>
not been understood and that he would have to write a book to bring
<br>
everything together.  It would include experimental work with different
<br>
CAs, setting up a taxonomy and classification system to show what kinds
<br>
of variety they can produce with even simple rules; theoretical work
<br>
on their properties; and even observations from nature to show specific
<br>
examples of complexity in nature which fit well into the CA model.
<br>
<p>On his site there is an amazing page showing sea shells with complex
<br>
patterns that appear indistinguishable from the output of some of
<br>
his CAs.  I don't know how many other examples he has like this but it
<br>
does seem that in at least this one case the CA model is very helpful
<br>
in understanding what is happening in those shells.
<br>
<p>Writing the book took a lot longer than he expected.  He has essentially
<br>
disappeared from the public eye for the past 10 years, and now is coming
<br>
out to promote the book.  It has been a sacrifice for someone who has
<br>
been admired and famous since he was a boy.  Now we will see whether he
<br>
is more than an aging wunderkind and whether the book lives up to his
<br>
rather extravagant claims.
<br>
<p>His results would be &quot;enough to fill hundreds - maybe thousands - of
<br>
scientific papers,&quot; according to Wolfram.  The question in my mind is
<br>
whether what he says has predictive value.  It's of little use to show
<br>
similarities and correspondences between disparate phenomena and his CAs.
<br>
Can you do something useful with this?  Part of the reason chaos theory
<br>
has not lived up to its hype is because you can analyze and classify it,
<br>
but ultimately chaos is still unpredictable.  So the theory is rather
<br>
sterile and mathematical and doesn't tend to produce experimental
<br>
predictions and validations (there are exceptions of course).
<br>
<p>The bottom line is not whether this book is a summary of important
<br>
results; it is how many new experiments and directions of research it
<br>
suggests.  That is what will determine whether Wolfram's magnum opus makes
<br>
a real contribution to science, even revolutionizing it as he suggests.
<br>
I am looking forward to the publication with interest.
<br>
<p>Hal
