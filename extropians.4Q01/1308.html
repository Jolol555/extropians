<em>&gt;From RE: (||Universe) Freedom from genes
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Your time is so much better put to use learning about people AS THEY ARE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not AS SOME THINK THEY SHOULD BE.  These things waste the little time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have when you are not doing homework, and they distract you from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real job you have to do.
</em><br>
<p>I think I know myself well enough to believe seriously that we can start a rational society. As I mentioned, I don't need everyone
<br>
to think the same as me, just a number sufficient to start a society, from a few hundred to perhaps ten thousand.
<br>
<p><p>Meanwhile, psychology and sociology textbooks don't help much, because no one had yet conducted such experiments on the cases that I
<br>
propose. Extrapolating behavior from current knowledge would only make the self-fulfilling prophecy come true: If no one believes in
<br>
a Rational Society, then it will not exist and we will remain stuck with our current social structures.
<br>
<p>Human psychology differs from science. In science, something can happen and we can repeat the same experiment and get the same
<br>
results whether we believe a certain hypothesis or not. In the study of the social &quot;sciences&quot;, things can happen that we cannot
<br>
predict, foresee and evaluate, and sometimes only manifest themselves if the observers, experimenters and those experimented on have
<br>
certain belief systems. Thus, what we read and see in real life has only limited value.
<br>
<p><p>I don't believe in what people call &quot;human nature&quot;, which exists as an unchanging set of behaviour that humans will always repeat. I
<br>
think human behavior goes far more complex. I believe in a value-neutral system which outputs behaviour based on some factors such
<br>
as genetic predisposition, previous experiences and current (and even projected future) environmental conditions. Again, I had not
<br>
completed this theory so I don't have a complete description of it.
<br>
<p>At any one time, a person still retains sufficient ability to deviate from the genetic experiences and learnt experiences, if the
<br>
environment allows or encourages it. To prove this hypothesis beyond doubt, a society that provides such an environment must exist,
<br>
and some people must join it and also believe that the experiment will work out.
<br>
<p><p>I have the view that the current society does not suit me. If I can't change them and I can't get into an acceptable alternative
<br>
one, then I would find it unworthy of my time to live in such a society. I would perhaps live by myself, if &quot;human nature&quot; of a
<br>
negative nature does really prevail in our societies.
