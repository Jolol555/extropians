<p>Yes, of course -- everything is entirely subjective.  But
<br>
there is a big difference between my saying &quot;The sky is blue&quot;
<br>
and &quot;I feel that the sky is red&quot;.  One is a commonly accepted
<br>
assertion.  The other most people would assume had a significant
<br>
amount of self-interpretive &quot;value&quot; added (and would not be
<br>
something they might feel required to comment on one way or
<br>
another).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's certainly what I mean when I use a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Lots of us take responsibility for our &quot;believing&quot; our own
<br>
words (and extropians do better than most at backing them
<br>
up with some hard data most of the time) -- but what I
<br>
think is needed is greater &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for
<br>
how the other person might receive the communication.
<br>
Because Extropians are so used to speaking with others who
<br>
inherently reject disagree with their perspectives, I think
<br>
we may to easily fall into the trap of &quot;These are my beliefs
<br>
and nothing you can say is going to change my mind&quot; (because
<br>
I've actually devoted some rational thought, or a fair amount
<br>
of study, etc. to why I have them [rather than just accepting
<br>
what my parents or society handed me on a plate]).  The
<br>
problem is we need to switch tracks when we come back to
<br>
the Extropian list -- this is our &quot;tribe&quot; and many of us
<br>
devoted significant energies to developing our positions.
<br>
So we need an inherent respect for that investment.
<br>
Getting an &quot;old&quot; Extropian to change their mind is
<br>
probably more difficult than herding cats.  So we have
<br>
to *think* about how the other person is going to process
<br>
the arguments we present and present them in the most
<br>
acceptable manner to that person.  That is the difference
<br>
between a good communicator someone who merely types fast.
<br>
Now of course the problem with a &quot;list&quot; is that packaging
<br>
your arguments for one person probably means you may have
<br>
unpackaged them for many others.  That is one of the things
<br>
that gets discovered in scientific review -- places where things
<br>
might be entirely obvious to the scientist and their lab -- but where
<br>
the reviewers significantly misinterpret what is being presented.
<br>
<p>I agree English is a terrible language -- all I'm suggesting is
<br>
we attempt to catch ourselves when things might be misinterpreted
<br>
and add an IBT, IFT, IMO, etc.  The language spoken in Udmurtia
<br>
(Udmurt) has a verb past tense that indicates something happened
<br>
but the speaker wasn't witness to it.  There may also be aspects
<br>
of Aymara that have truth/reality perspectives (I haven't investigated
<br>
this in detail).  We could of course make up some additional
<br>
conjugations for English to express which &quot;reality&quot; we are
<br>
talking about (our personal one, the extropian one, the
<br>
generally accepted fundamentalist one (with a few subtypes
<br>
depending on which religion), the conventional scientific
<br>
one or the physical one.  But by the time we got through
<br>
however, I don't think it would much resemble English,
<br>
would only be understood by only a select few and would
<br>
clearly put us well on the path to becoming a cult.
<br>
<p>I'm simply requesting that people attempt to think a little
<br>
bit more about the &quot;receiving&quot; side of the communication,
<br>
not just the sending side.
