Is it fiction or science which is holistic rather than reductive? Science, 
<br>
we guess at first, is surely the very paradigm of the reductive, stripping 
<br>
the meat and fat from the bone, boiling down the flensed carcase into a 
<br>
skeletal substrate, all sumptuous life reduced to numbers. But that's true 
<br>
also of the mechanics of fiction, as narratologists show us: every imagined 
<br>
action, in folk story and Tolstoy alike, derives from a handful or two of 
<br>
types, functions, actants, deployed in words built from an equally small 
<br>
number of distinguishable acoustic or graphic segments. Meanwhile, even the 
<br>
most austere and limited science cannot (or should not) escape the context 
<br>
of its whole surround, as the non-local connections of quantum theory 
<br>
prove, the vast geometries of Relativity's inertial frames, the dense 
<br>
ecological webs of the life sciences, the no-less-dense economic and 
<br>
psychological webs of culture. Fiction's mythemes, science's vectors and 
<br>
tensors, serve alike to direct us in (re)constructing stories adequate, in 
<br>
some appropriate and contextually satisfying fashion, to the unspeakable 
<br>
plenitude of the world.&lt;

<p><p>Damien, forgive me for not reading this cornecopic paragraph, but it wasn't attached to the email I responded to. I still think your paint brush is enormous, and doused with multi-colored pigments. Instead of corners there are bay windows with a view.
<br>
<p>Mythemes in our transhumanist culture are quite precious building blocks of culture and a means to apply reason to imagination. I think of &quot;serious fiction&quot; as an appropriate phrase to describe this mental mobility and bundling, although there is certainly shortcomings in mytheme translations.  Back to Units and vectors.
