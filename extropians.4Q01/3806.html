There is a weekly reunion every tuesday at 19h00 until the 11th december
<br>
2001 at  1867, rue Amherst, Montreal .
<br>
Here is my translation:
<br>
___________________________________________________________________
<br>
&quot;The fifth session of the weekly study group organized by the National
<br>
Council of the Youth Comission on the future of the province of Quebec under
<br>
the theme: &quot; In wich world are we living, in wich world do we want to live?&quot;
<br>
The goal of this session is to assist youth, students and activists to
<br>
develop their fight to realize their demands and aspirations, for a Quebec
<br>
modern and sovereing, in the actual context of the &quot;fight against terrorism&quot;
<br>
that have been launched by american imperialism against the &quot;people of the
<br>
world&quot;.
<br>
<p>Tuesday 4 december: the obscurantist division of the world between good and
<br>
evil, the civilized countries versus the uncivilized and barbarians.
<br>
<p>Tuesday 11th december, ending session:
<br>
For a government anti-war. Organized by the National Council for Youth
<br>
Comission on the future of the province of Quebec.
<br>

<p>I don't have much practice in debate and I would like to optimize the
<br>
reception of our memes.
<br>
How should go at it? don't want to shock them close.
<br>
What are the predictable attacks that I will have to destroy in this case?
<br>
&nbsp;Wich online articles would be the pertinent?
<br>
Braindump on the list  on &quot;the world we want to live&quot; in a short and concise
<br>
way,  for a warm-up! :)
<br>
<p>I hope my post will generate responses that will integrate what's good in
<br>
the activist perspective.
