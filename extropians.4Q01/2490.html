It may be true that Jorn Barger, of the Robowisdom weblog, treads
<br>
rather closely to outright apologism for Islamofascists. You can also
<br>
see for yourself that every single day he posts three or four pictures
<br>
with captions like &quot;cute refugee kids maimed/starved due to heartless
<br>
US/Israeli oppression&quot; but the RAWA.org website continues to elude his
<br>
attention even though they also have pictures-- of women and children
<br>
the Talibastards have *deliberately* maimed/starved/raped. Finally,
<br>
one could make a case for his criticism of Israel going beyond a
<br>
factual, rational disagreement with that government's policy and into
<br>
all-out kneejerk hatred of all things Israeli or Jewish and a kneejerk
<br>
love of anybody who's against them.
<br>
<p>Notwithstanding his biases, however, he is a good source of dirt on
<br>
what our naughty intelligence boys have been doing. He has compiled
<br>
some of his references into a timeline:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com/issues/phoenix.html">http://www.robotwisdom.com/issues/phoenix.html</a>
<br>
<p>This way, as an enlightened patriot, you can be familiar with the
<br>
fuckups of our spooks and correct the naive, unenlightened patriots
<br>
when they blindly mouth Bush's &quot;We are good, they are bad&quot; mantra
<br>
(terrorists are bad, big imperialists governments are bad, we need to
<br>
clean up our act, but first we need to fight our way out of the mess
<br>
we got ourselves into). You'll also not be surprised by any curves
<br>
lefties will throw at you (I'm with you, comrade-- let us get rid of
<br>
this oppressive state once and for all, and let the people rule...  by
<br>
freely entering into contracts and transactions amongst themselves).
<br>

* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
* honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
* and its Jihad.&quot;                                                   *
