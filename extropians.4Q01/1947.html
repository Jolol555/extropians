<p><em>    &gt;the US  government should just disengage...
</em><br>
<p>That would be the ideal solution but unfortunately it's not possible.
<br>
Al Qaeda doesn't want us to disengage they want us to die.
<br>
You think all this is really because the USA has a few hundred soldiers
<br>
in Saudi Arabia a thousand miles from Mecca? Baloney. It's because the
<br>
Islamic world sees its ideas being made irrelevant by popular western culture
<br>
and we can't disengage from that.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; The regimes in Egypt and Saudi Arabia helped to make al Qaeda possible.
</em><br>
<p>Well, due to cowardice they did turn a blind eye to individuals helping Al Qaeda
<br>
in their territory that's true, but that's not nearly as bad as active and open support
<br>
by Taleban style nuts. Dictators we can deal with, no problem.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Also, the Pakistani government -- of course, after the coup it's much the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; same -- helped to put and keep the Taleban in power!
</em><br>
<p>True, but so what? For whatever reason they're willing to help us get rid of the
<br>
Taleban now, are you suggesting we should ignore their help? As Churchill said
<br>
&quot;If Hitler invaded hell I would give aid to the devil&quot;.
