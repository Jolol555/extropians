Subject: META: List Focus
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did an informal experiment yesterday: I refrained from posting on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians list (in order not to distort the experiment), and simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categorized every post for how relevant to extropianism or transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My sample was 117 posts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That leaves 83 posts, 70.1%. These dealt with mainly with politics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism, religion, semantics, technical details and a sizeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of banter. While I think there has to be a connection between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianism and politics, the views expressed in these posts were in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practically all cases just traditional views, exactly similar to what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would hear on any other mailing list. No applying of extropian ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to current situations, no deeper analysis of how the situation affects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extropian project beyond traditional narratives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there a problem here? I think so. The social interaction part is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important, without it extropians would just be an ordinary SIG. But when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the actual extropian content becomes so small (the core posts were just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7.7%) the list becomes just an ordinary forum in any case. That means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that developing new extropian ideas and concepts is not best done here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, there is a fairly positive audience here, but the total brainpower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is directed at everyday issues rather than extropian issues, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real extropian discussion never gets off the ground. It is a bit like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the critical mass problem with mailing lists: a too small list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of how good it is, will not sustain itself. Here we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small extropians list embedded in a big noisy forum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Your numbers seem right to me. I know that moderators have been proposed
<br>
from time to time and many of us are not enthusiastic about the idea. I
<br>
don't know if this idea has been mentioned but what about a convention that
<br>
has everyone assign their poss with an Extropian value to it. The more
<br>
Extropian an idea the higher its value, thus, 10 might represent an idea or
<br>
thread that is clearly Extropian, and 0 something that has no Extropian
<br>
value. For example Anders said that of the 117 posts yesterday:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Of these *9* were unequivocally extropian. They expressed concepts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values consistent with the principles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Let us suppose that these posts might merit say somewhere between 7-10 on an
<br>
Extropian scale. Anders added that
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 22 were somewhat related, dealing with cool technology, advances in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science, economics in a rapidly changing world, social interactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between transhumanists and ways of treating motion sickness.
</em><br>
<p>Let us suppose that these are say between 4 and 7 on the Extropian scale.
<br>
The remainder of the posts would be between 0 and 4. The convention then
<br>
would be that one has to rate the Extropian content of their post. The
<br>
subject line would include an estimate of the Extropian content. So, suppose
<br>
my subject line was &quot;Donation (E10)&quot;; this would mean that the post had high
<br>
Extropian content. Let us imagine that the content of the post is that Bill
<br>
Gates has donated 10 billion dollars say to the Extropian foundation. On the
<br>
other hand the subject line &quot;Heston (E0)&quot; would mean that the post has no
<br>
Extropian content. Let us suppose the discussion is how many guns Charelton
<br>
Heston owns. Often what happens is that an original post with high Extropian
<br>
content quickly degenerates into low Extropian content. What this would mean
<br>
is that if people are being objective, the E-value of a thread may often go
<br>
down (but of course it could go up). The advantages of this system are
<br>
twofold: First, it might make many of us more self-conscious about the
<br>
content and worth of our posts. Second, it might make the list easier to
<br>
manage. When I come back from a week away and see 800 Extropian messages in
<br>
my in box I hardly know where to start. This system would allow the most
<br>
relevant to be read and the rest to be trashed. Obviously we will not all
<br>
agree on the exact E-value of every post or thread but this may not be as
<br>
critical as it may first appear. If somebody always ranks his posts in the
<br>
upper range and comments on every thread then we may doubt his objectivity.
<br>
On the other hand, as I get to know the sort of E-value that say Anders, Hal
<br>
or Damien assign to a thread, I will soon have an idea of how it relates to
<br>
my own estimation. To make this system work it would probably be best to
<br>
work out some examples of the E-value of some archived posts: we could write
<br>
a page where we would assign an E-value and then explain why we gave it this
<br>
assignment. This would provide us with a common reference, and also, as new
<br>
people joined the list, we could refer them to our discussion of the
<br>
E-convention.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given this post a high E-value because I think it is important
<br>
that we think of some way to make the list more manageable. For myself, the
<br>
less time I have to wade through some of the off-topic posts the more I can
<br>
spend on productive matters like furthering the cause of transhumanism.
<br>
Thoughts?
