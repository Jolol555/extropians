<em>&gt;From: Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Anthrax%20addendum&In-Reply-To=&lt;200110161419.HAA26477@well.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;When dismantling anything, it is useful to look for contributing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;causes of what one would like to see go away or at least be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rendered powerless.  Yet I have seen almost no signs that the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is willing to admit to the abuses that have led in part to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;atmosphere under which various forms of extremism flourish in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Middle East.  
</em><br>
<p>Because we didn't cause this Samantha, and we most certainly didn't
<br>
invent Islamic extremism.
<br>
<p>We happen to be a handy target, and considerably too soft for our
<br>
own good. This is going to change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Assuming for a moment that the above figures are true (which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have not seen the evidence for), is it the plan to pressure and if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessary attack up to 60 countries looking for this network
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is supposedly (for the sake of argument) the source of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ills?  If so then this cure seems to me at least as dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and costly in lives as the disease.  
</em><br>
<p>We are going to attack the base of operations of this terrorist
<br>
network, and then isolate (politically, economically) any remaining
<br>
countries that support these people.
<br>
<p>And yes, militarily if we have to.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;We could not even defeat the Vietcong and yet we plan to find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and remove such a supposed widespread and in places popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;network in 60 countries?  This seems a highly dubious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dangerous proposal.  We want to dismantle all terror networks? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Good.  Be sure to insure our own terror network, the CIA.  Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you think I have no justification for that statement?  I suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you take a trip down memory lane of some of the publicized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things the CIA has done supposedly in our name.
</em><br>
<p>The situations are not analogous, Vietnam was a civil war backed by
<br>
communist countries. In this case we have attacked those who
<br>
attacked us with the express intent of preventing any future
<br>
attacks.
<br>
<p>Yes, the intent is to dismantle all terrorist networks.
<br>
<p>Yes, the CIA has done questionable things in the past and should be
<br>
prevented from doing so in the future.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Do you think we are on the right track to give effectively carte
</em><br>
<em>&gt;blanche to the government to rifle through all of our lives at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will and to fight an indeterminately long and hazardous ware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against an indeterminate number of targets regardless of any and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all costs?
</em><br>
<p>They do not have such rights, nor will they get them.
<br>
<p>The war aspect of this will most likely not be long.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't - not for a second. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I also think we are lying in that we are not admitting where we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contribute to terror directly and indirectly.  As long as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't address the problems with our own foreign policy then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claims that we are doing everything necessary for the safety and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well-being of ourselves and reasonable people everywhere are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather empty.  I think we are being extremely two-faced when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;let Israel get away with literal murder and assassinations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broad daylight, even using weapons we gave them, and say almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing.  Yet let any Palestinian hit back in any form and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are all over the PLO.  I think we are dishonest and/or heartless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when we say that the 600,000 children that have died in Iraq as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the result of our bombing and blockades are reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collateral damage.  If I was Arab, even a very secular Arab, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be extremely unhappy with the US on many counts.  Yet we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;often act as if only a bunch of crazed fanatics really are upset
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with us and that no reasonable persons in the region have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real complain.  Our President has the nerve to claim as much on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;national TV.  
</em><br>
<p>It's funny how some people are always blaming Israel, and
<br>
completely ignore the long history of terrorism committed by the
<br>
PLO, an organization run by a terrorist. An organization that sided
<br>
with Sadam Hussein during the gulf war, danced in the streets when
<br>
the Israelis were unprovokedly attacked with Scuds, and continued
<br>
their dancing when the World trade center was destroyed. An
<br>
organization that continues to harbour an organization (Hamas)
<br>
who's expressed intent is to destroy Israel.
<br>
<p>The Palestinians are not our friends.
<br>
<p>You're right, we never should have blockaded Iraq, we should have
<br>
continued the war till we had Sadam's head on a stick. Funny how
<br>
you blame Iraq's troubles on us instead of Sadam for refusing to
<br>
comply with the U.N. sanctions and terms of surrender.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I love this country with all my heart.  But it sickens me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;watch some of what we are doing now and some of the postures we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are assuming.
</em><br>
<p>I love this country too, in fact I put four of the best years of my
<br>
life in her service, and would do so again.
<br>
<p>It sickens me to see people jumping to bad, unfounded conclusions
<br>
against it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And we or rather some of our agencies that have run amok and now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are being handed even greater powers over both ourselves and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rest of the world with even less oversight, are much more in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong ourselves than I see most people in the US admitting to. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know all sophisticated Al Qaeda is or is not and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspect, neither does anyone here.  But our know our own CIA has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been active for good and often ill all over the globe for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decades and has sources of funding that are nearly untraceable. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And I know it is ultra-sophisticated. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And routinely trips over its own two feet, the CIA more closely
<br>
resembles a badly run circus to me than anything else.
<br>
<p>The CIA will probably get extensive new powers after this by the
<br>
way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I'm gratified to see that some of the new emergency laws being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; passed have sunset provisions.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would be more gratified if we spent as long considering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implications and dangerous of these new laws and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost-benefit ratio of them as we spent pouring over the sex life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Clinton.  Personally I think our civil liberties and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guarantees of freedom at home are worth at least that much.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't see that very much gain in detecting and stopping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorist actions will be achieved as against the very real and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deep eroding of our liberty and safety from tyranny.  
</em><br>
<p>Good, it's very important to fight against tyranny, of course if
<br>
that means depriving millions of law abiding american gun owners of
<br>
their constitutional rights it's completely different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't expect the sunset provisions to ever be agreed to by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bush.  If they are I don't expect him to be through with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indeterminate holy war when the sunset clause is up.  
</em><br>
<p>This too will pass, and any politician not savvy enough to realize
<br>
this will be replaced.
