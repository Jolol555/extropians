I've enjoyed reading the Leonid slice-o-life viewing experiences, and so 
<br>
offer my own tale.
<br>
<p>Although I generally wake a bit before dawn on Sundays to catch the morning 
<br>
glass at Old Man's, I set my alarm especially early last Sunday.  I planned 
<br>
to get to the beach well before sunrise to enjoy the shower well away from 
<br>
city lights--and maybe even out on my board.  So at 4:30 am I stepped out in 
<br>
the yard to see if the clouds were cooperating.  Not bad.  Like Hal, I live 
<br>
in a coastal town that often gets morning fog.  This time, though, only a few 
<br>
high and scattered clouds, still well off to the south, blocked the view.  
<br>
Even looking up through the comparatively narrow shute afforded by the houses 
<br>
surrounding my backyard, I could see lines of light spitting and sputtering 
<br>
down.
<br>
<p>My bungling about woke my wife, who joined me outside.  For a panicked moment 
<br>
we thought that the sliding glass door had locked behind us, but it turns out 
<br>
that the lock didn't quite catch.  We admired the show for a while and 
<br>
discussed whether to wake our daughter.  Figuring that she was too young to 
<br>
appreciate the phenomena and not at all too old to catch a good show later in 
<br>
life, we let her doze.  
<br>
<p>I'd already prepared all my gear the night before, so I downed some coffee 
<br>
and hit the road.  I joined a short line of vehicles waiting at the gate of 
<br>
the state surfing beach, killed the engine, and opened the sunroof.  
<br>
Unfortunately, though, some high cloud cover had drifted in and begun 
<br>
brightening in the dawn, effectively blocking out the view.  But I can't 
<br>
complain.  Once the gates opened at 6 am and I'd parked on the beach, I found 
<br>
a light offshore breeze and a good swell coming in.  As we say in the local 
<br>
venacular, &quot;Saaaaaaweeeeet!&quot;
