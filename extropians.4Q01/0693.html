<p>I think the problem (intolerance, extremism, hate, etc) comes
<br>
about when people are raised in oppressive enviroments.  This
<br>
doesn't mean you have to be poor or have abusive parents, it
<br>
can just as easily be overbearing parents or an affluent
<br>
environment with all the associated expectations.  This
<br>
happens, I think, because people require a certain amount of
<br>
space to develop as individuals.  If you're always busy
<br>
worrying about how you're going to feed yourself next week or,
<br>
conversely, you're always busy living up to (or rebelling
<br>
against) the &quot;family name&quot; your personal development will be
<br>
stunted and you'll be more likely to take on the values of
<br>
those around you without question.  My low tech extropian
<br>
solution is cheap computers; they can provide a world to
<br>
escape into as well as an enviroment suited to exploration and
<br>
self-expression.  This isn't much help if you really are
<br>
starving though, so my high tech extropian solution is to say:
<br>
maybe it's time we considered augmenting new born humans with
<br>
advanced technologies such as food, shelter, and health care.
