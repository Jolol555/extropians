<p><p>I think the people defending this point of view mix two different
<br>
things (they may hold it coherently, but they happen to defend it by
<br>
mixing these two things).
<br>
<p>The first is objectivity. You were educated, and further educated
<br>
yourself, to dismiss alleged differences that were actually not
<br>
measurable. We have no disagreement on that, or at least we can
<br>
suppose we agree on this for this debate, for this is not actually the
<br>
point. (and each time this gets raised, one gets farther from solving
<br>
the puzzle)
<br>
<p>The second is distinction between distinct objects, possibly similar
<br>
(and in fact possibly, at least in theory, identical), which is
<br>
somewhere in the very basic layers of common sense --- and routinely
<br>
used in science, too, of course.
<br>
<p>Suppose you imagine (in a classroom) two missiles, and plot their
<br>
course ; you do not need to assert differences between them to
<br>
distinguish them, do you ? When you say &quot;let a and b be two missiles&quot;,
<br>
you have distinguished them. In fact, if the two missiles are of the
<br>
same model-build-etc., you have no clue about differences between
<br>
them, and in fact you consider them as identical (you happen to know
<br>
that actual missiles would have some difference or other, but you
<br>
wouldn't know nor care about them). But will you conflate them into
<br>
one single missile ? Will you, once &quot;shuffled&quot;, deny that one is the
<br>
one we had named missile A, and the other the one we had called
<br>
missile B, whether you can now tell or not ?
<br>
<p>It is not a matter of your consciousness being something ineffably
<br>
different or I don't know what. Proper names like &quot;Lee Daniel Crocker&quot;
<br>
designate a singular entity, not a class, not a design. It is not a
<br>
common name, it is not an abstraction. You may redefine it as a common
<br>
name ; then say so and it will be clear. You will use &quot;Lee Daniel
<br>
Crocker&quot; like the word &quot;apple&quot;, and you will write on your home page :
<br>
&quot;I am *A* Lee Daniel Crocker&quot;. But as long as you take it as a proper
<br>
name, it will refer to one single instance of any abstractable design
<br>
you may care to conceive from what you actual reality, the one single
<br>
instance that you actually are.
<br>
<p>To be more objective and avoid the &quot;you&quot; problem : THAT lump of
<br>
matter, being a male human individual, is fictionnaly taken to be a
<br>
&quot;person&quot; (an unclear concept linked to pre-scientific &quot;soul&quot;-based
<br>
ideas, or just to the necessities of common psychological
<br>
interpretation), and so it is said that that person IS that lump of
<br>
matter (it should be said, at least). If you want to stay objective,
<br>
you just say that this is lump of matter A, and this (the copy) is
<br>
lump of matter B. If you introduce the &quot;you/me&quot; pronoun, and the fictional
<br>
unity that this imply, then you must say that YOU ARE THAT LUMP OF
<br>
MATTER.
<br>
<p>You may rejoice at the idea that your cherished mind be embodied in
<br>
many brains of many sorts coordinating many bodies of many
<br>
composition. That would not be very surprising, as many people, after
<br>
all, seem to rejoice that some of their traits be embodied by the
<br>
people they procreate.
<br>
<p>But what you are now is just THAT lump of matter, and if it gets back
<br>
to dust, you get back to dust, because you are nothing else than that.
<br>
<p><p>Jacques
