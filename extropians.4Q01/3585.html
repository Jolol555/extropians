<p>Of *course*, since their own experience would feel as if it apodictically
<br>
substantiated this viewpoint--they would recall the scan, then waking up
<br>
and learning of the regrettable loss of an earlier chrysalis. So, noting
<br>
that this felt just fine, they'd be more inclined to project an attitude of
<br>
hope toward the next iteration, and so on, ever more strongly.
<br>
<p>This *doesn't* mean their fallible sense of conviction is *valid*, any more
<br>
than a surviving soldier's faith in God supports the existence of this
<br>
imaginary contrivance--although in both cases, I'm sure the experience
<br>
would `confirm' the prejudice. As usual, we need a possible disconfirmatory
<br>
instance: the canonical one seems to be the survival of the original after
<br>
activation of the copy, and the copy's utter sense of conviction that he or
<br>
she *is* the original and retains full property rights etc in the
<br>
original's goods, position in society, etc.
<br>
<p>But this topic really does get old so fast, and without any resolution,
<br>
maybe we shouldn't go there again.
