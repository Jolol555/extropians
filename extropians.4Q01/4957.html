</em><br>
<em>&gt; that fit any claim you want to make.  Does your model capture anything
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not.  To me, it's kind of like the &quot;corn economy&quot; used by Adam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smith.  See Peter Lewin's _Capital in Disequilibrium_, pp 47-52.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Imaginary worlds are quite useful to analyze principles. Game theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissects simple behaviors under controlled conditions, like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation of bacterial colonies on agar prepares the doctor to face the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real infections afflicting humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BTW, can you give valid historical evidence of the beneficial effects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the absence of a government on social development (I mean *total* absence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a government resulting in great improvements in quality and quantity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human life)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; New Freedom, where free yeomen till their initially equal parcels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of land and pay only minimal taxes to support a freely elected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constabulary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taxes are coercive.  Elections are coercive.  You model already has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercion built into it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### OK - you made my day. Let's say the colonists just arrive haphazardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from other planets, in small groups, like the Native Americans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Polynesians, Easter Islanders. With no constabulary, individuals with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; penchant for rape and pillage will inevitably act up. A tribal warfare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system will inevitably develop (or can you give me historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterexamples?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As is usual, some farmers are more ingenious and hard-working than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others and in the emerging cash economy earn enough to buy land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and hire some of the less smart ones to work there, for a smaller,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; market-determined pay but without the hassle of running a business.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Soon the land owned by the big farmers and their offspring covers a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greater and greater fraction of the available land. Since having more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; land gives you a better credit position, the rich can easily survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; periods of bad weather and famine, while some of the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; farmers are eliminated by chance - a few hectares of crop eaten by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; locust, a desperate need to feed the family, a quick sale of land, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before you know, there is an underclass of landless laborers, unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to compete with large farms, unable to buy land (you need to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; money to buy land but since most money in this economy comes from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; land, you need land to buy land). This works like a ratchet. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; landless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people are willing to work for a pittance, as there is a large supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them (it's much easier to produce a few humans than a new plot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; land, so barring pestilence, war and famine, there is more people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than land), they have no choice (there is no industry on this backward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pimple of a planet)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another unrealistic assumption.  I'd expect some industry to arise and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological progress -- unless there were strict controls against it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### How many thousands of years did take to invent the wheel (counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the first emergence of ungoverned humans)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A government (usually a bad one) will form well before industry, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without stability offered by a good government, hardly any research will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and they can only work for the large landowners,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as the small farmers do not need hired hands or couldn't afford it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is no more than the basic economic scenario of Karl Marx being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; played out in an agrarian society on another planet.  Notably, it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scenario that has ever played out in a real agrarian society without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive coercion involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Coercion always comes first - government comes later. This played out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies hundreds of times (again, Native
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans, Polynesians......)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Every ten laborers you have working for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; means you can buy out another small farmer who is in trouble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The freely elected constabulary will not do anything because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no crimes are committed. An oligopoly controlling land forms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spontaneously, stifling competition, slowing progress, ruthlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destroying its opponents. The rich soon form a hermetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aristocracy, buy control of the government, and change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; name of the colony to New Colombia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is unlikely for many reasons.  One, as more land gets bought up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the incentive for people to band together against further buying up will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### What do you mean exactly? Communes putting together their monies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy land from the rich? Where on Earth did they form (aside from those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insignificant credit unions)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Such cooperation happens &quot;spontaneously&quot; in many instances --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from small businesses helping each other out to various corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (why wouldn't landowners just hire the right people to manage their land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them and run it like a corporation?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ###  Precisely what types of &quot;small businesses&quot; are going to help each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other out, trying to stop land consolidation and how?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Landowners do - they hire accountants, overseers, and hundreds of cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peons to do the work, if such laboreres are available due to the scarcity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of land.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and other contractual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreements to ward off mergers and the like.  (Sometimes, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient to do so, but beforehand, we can't always be sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntary behavior is inefficient or that coerced behavior can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Who is going to ward off mergers??? Why? How? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We agreed there is no coercion allowed in this experiment, so you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be pretty smart, trying to stop landowners from consolidating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their holdings by marriage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two, land will go up in value if some want to buy more and more of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The price will rise, meaning that owners of it will make more money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no way to tell how much, but this already shows how your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario is a bit unrealistic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### You are forgetting that the large landowners make more money than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small ones, both gross, and sometimes even per acre (they can afford the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive, imported machines). The less land available for sale there is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more difficult it is for the small operators to join the game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Three, you assume that inheritance alone will preserve large estates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Historically, this has not been the case.  In fact, inherited wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often declines after a time.  Surely, there are exceptions, but even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biggest family fortunes tend to get consumed over time and less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entrepreneurial and frugal family members take over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Historically, that *was* the case, at least in countries with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primogeniture (or can you give me specific and numerous counterexamples?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;From rags to rags in three generations&quot; is mainly a phenomenon of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalist society, where you need to be on your toes to stay on top.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This process, the concentration of a crucial and non-expandable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Land actually is expandable in many ways.  One, land that was formerly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marginal can become profitable if it's physically altered, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleared, irrigated, and plowed.  Two, if the price of land increases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall, then more marginal pieces will be economically usable.  Three,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land can be created in the sense of reclaiming land from the sea or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building islands.  Four, things like agriskyscrapers could create new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land on top of old land -- if they became economical.  We can't just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume static amounts and values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### This is orthogonal to the issue of land concentration - land is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanded only if there is population pressure, with total demand for food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceeding the supply. It does not result in an unlimited supply of land at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitive prices - entrepreneurs cannot make money by offering cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;land&quot; in skyscrapers to undercut the traditional landowners (as opposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to memory chip makers being able to flood the market with every new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advance in technology). Marginal land sometimes offers a refuge for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsistence farmers, but with enough pressure even they might end up being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; displaced.
