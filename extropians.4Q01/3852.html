<p><p>By the BBC's Ania Lichtarowicz 
<br>
Prehistoric humans did not go through a period of adolescence, according to 
<br>
new scientific evidence published in the journal Nature. 
<br>
<p>Scientists believe that one of our ancestors, Homo erectus, may have 
<br>
developed more like an ape and missed out on adolescence - which evolved in 
<br>
later humans to allow for extra learning time. 
<br>
<p>Homo erectus roamed parts of Africa about two million years ago and showed 
<br>
many modern human characteristics, such as shorter arms. 
<br>
<p>Scientists had believed these features all evolved simultaneously to create 
<br>
modern man, but a new study on the fossilised teeth of Homo erectus shows he 
<br>
was never a typical teenager. 
<br>
<p>Ape-like 
<br>
<p>Teeth are a very accurate way of calculating how old someone is, and how 
<br>
quickly they develop shows how quickly an individual reaches adulthood. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Adolescence as we know it developed about half a million years ago, 
<br>
scientists say
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
By cutting thin sections of a tooth and looking at it under a powerful 
<br>
microscope, it was possible to count markings in the tooth enamel to 
<br>
determine how long it had taken for the tooth to grow. 
<br>
<p>These markings are like tree rings, and very accurately measure the age of an 
<br>
individual. 
<br>
<p>It appears that early human ancestors grew up very much like today's great 
<br>
apes - taking about 12 years to reach adulthood. 
<br>
<p>Modern humans on the other hand take much longer - up to 20 years. 
<br>
<p>Small brain 
<br>
<p>The difference seems to allow us to learn how to use our bigger brains. 
<br>
<p>The research carried out on the fossilised teeth suggests that the extended 
<br>
period of adolescence, as we know it, only developed about half a million 
<br>
years ago. 
<br>
<p>The scientists behind the work say that if Homo erectus did not go through 
<br>
adolescence, then he did not need an extended learning time. 
<br>
<p>This, they say, is because he still had a small ape-like brain.
