<em>&gt; Quite simply, putting full blown nanotech into the hands of a single

</em><br>
<em>&gt; your proposal of openly developing potential weapons of mass destruction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is utterly naive. It would be something like openly developing nukes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a parallel universe where any matter is capable of being used as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the core. The end result would have been that everyone would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built them, and instead of a cold war we would have had something much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse.
</em><br>
<p>Would you please turn down your amygdala a bit? I did not say &quot;let's
<br>
give everybody guns to play with&quot; but rather &quot;I prefer the guns in the
<br>
open and distributed so that we can force everybody to be accountable
<br>
with them&quot;. Quite a difference. Have you read &quot;The Weapon of Openness&quot;
<br>
by by Arthur Kantrowitz?
<br>
(<a href="http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Background4.html">http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Background4.html</a>) If not, please do
<br>
that now. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What exactly is your scenario for where terrorists have drextech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet don't cause severe worldwide damage? A nanotech immune system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And what happens when they come up with a worm that breaches the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defenses? Humans have already proven themselves incapable of devising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a system that would prevent such disasters.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly what systems have been tried and failed? You make it sound like
<br>
people have tried to build immune systems forever. In reality, what we
<br>
need is different kinds of defenses against different threats,
<br>
overlapping and evolving to match the pace of what people invent or
<br>
imagine. It seems very likely that people would spend a sizeable
<br>
investment on immune systems, institutions controlling nano use and
<br>
various other methods of limiting risk, and the collective investment
<br>
would be far larger than any investment in coming up with malicious
<br>
nanotech. 
<br>
<p>It would be useful if we could estimate how dangerous a dangerous
<br>
person with nanotech is - and when? You have to estimate not just his
<br>
offensive capabilities, but also how dangerous they are compared to the
<br>
defenses of society around him. Quite a few of the nano-scare debates
<br>
seem to lack this kind of analysis.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Why fool around with such a possibility when leaving the nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully centralized would probably still allow for 90% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usefulness? Do I really need a home assembler? What for?
</em><br>
<p>Because centralization means that somebody has more control over the
<br>
nano than you have. Who do you trust with it? As I said, governments
<br>
have a bad history of that. This is why we need oversight and
<br>
accountability, and not just put all the responsibility at one group.
