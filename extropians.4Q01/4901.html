From: &quot;Mike Lorrey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Local%20Groups%20Wanted!&In-Reply-To=&lt;002e01c18b59$086791c0$892679a5@braniac&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I continue to be unemployed (anyone out there have positions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open?) while local employers prefer to outsource the sort of work I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Indian job shops...
</em><br>
<p>I while ago Max More asked for feedback/ideas regarding extropians and
<br>
transhumanists (his email was entitled &quot;What Can We Do For You?&quot;).  I meant
<br>
to write a few of my thoughts to Max, but got waylaid (by my own self,
<br>
natch).
<br>
<p>But Mike's post has brought Max's query to my mind again.  I'm writing to
<br>
the whole group, because I think this is an important point.  Extropians,
<br>
futurists and transhumanists portray themselves as optimists regarding
<br>
scientific and technological progress - good things to come in the future.
<br>
But racist jibes are old.  This is a free country, and I'm 110% behind
<br>
people using free speech to express themselves.  But racist jibes are old.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying extropians and transhumanists on this list are mostly
<br>
racists, but so help me, it seems as if there are a few.  It's been
<br>
explained that extropians and transhumanists are more &quot;open&quot; about voicing
<br>
their opinions, and that's why it only SEEMS as if there's more &quot;politically
<br>
incorrect&quot; stuff that may be regarded as racist.  But I don't buy it.  One
<br>
doesn't have to worry about holding politically correct positions for their
<br>
own sake.  If something is a good idea, it's a good idea.  If it's not, it's
<br>
not.  And hooray for the marketplace of ideas.
<br>
<p>But because racist jibes are old, a group's credibility may be impaired if
<br>
there are ideas bandied about that are regressive; even more so if that
<br>
group wants to promote itself as &quot;progressive.&quot;  Extropians and
<br>
transhumanists may be &quot;above&quot; caring about racial conflicts in the world,
<br>
but those conflicts are real and their problems are abundant.
<br>
<p>I personally am very interested in what progress may bode for humas (and
<br>
posthumans) in the future, but what prevents me from calling myself an
<br>
extropian are the somewhat (from my perspective) odd mixture of politics.
<br>
Ayn Rand, for instance.  She's on the extropian reading list.  Er.... isn't
<br>
she considered a joke?  (I read a lot of Ayn Rand in college many years ago,
<br>
so I'm not unfamiliar with her writings, but to take her seriously...yipes!)
<br>
I don't consider myself an extropian because of this strange mixture of
<br>
politics which emanate - obliquely, at times, but detectable and musty and
<br>
somewhat offputing, IMO.  While I do not have time to read even 20% of the
<br>
posts, I have enjoyed reading many of them, most of which I have found to be
<br>
interesting and helpful and original.  Yep, some great stuff ...
<br>
<p>O.
