<br>
<p>Question. Wind as a means to generate electricity or synthesis hydrogen, or 
<br>
gasoline or methanol or what?
<br>
<p>#### Wind even now is very close to being competitive pricewise against
<br>
coal, and as far as I know it's comparable or better than nuclear (at least
<br>
in the current regulatory and legal climate which makes nuclear power more
<br>
expensive than it should be). Once oil becomes more expensive and energy
<br>
prices edge up a little bit, wind could become the ideal source of energy -
<br>
inexhaustible, clean, decentralized, safe from terrorist threats, scalable
<br>
to almost any demand and CO2-emission neutral (I doubt the greenhouse effect
<br>
is what's cracked up to be but this is still a bonus). All this without any
<br>
major technological advances, such as the ones needed to bring photovoltaics
<br>
into the economic mainstream. And the reliability and price of wind turbines
<br>
is still improving, too.
<br>
<p>Once wind becomes an important source of electricity, it could be in
<br>
principle used to generate hydrogen, and even liquid fuels (like methanol or
<br>
hydrocarbons) but this would most likely be too expensive for transportation
<br>
purposes. Natural gas or coal conversion into fuels compatible with hybrid
<br>
electrics and with fuel cells most likely would be preferable (thus avoiding
<br>
the use of pure hydrogen in cars), unless some sort of &quot;Kyoto II&quot; treaty
<br>
would ban carbon dioxide emissions outright.
<br>
<p>By the way, nuclear energy might still be a reasonable solution - although I
<br>
imagine that it might be a good idea to concentrate all newly built reactors
<br>
in a few &quot;reactor parks&quot; - areas somewhere in the sparsely populated areas
<br>
in the center of the continental US, with single reactors spaced far apart
<br>
so that one nuclear bomb would not damage more than one reactor but close
<br>
enough for all reactors to share common defenses, including a restricted
<br>
entry perimeter, and air defense.
<br>
<p>In general, there is no reason to believe that there is an imminent energy
<br>
crisis - there are solutions waiting to be implemented, with only slightly
<br>
higher costs than oil, and the fuel cost of driving an average car will not
<br>
dramatically increase even if there is not a single drop of natural oil left
<br>
in the world - with improvements in energy efficiency of future cars, the
<br>
per mile cost of fuel will remain almost constant, even if the per gallon
<br>
price goes up. Absolutely no reason whatsoever to tax anybody for the
<br>
offence of driving an SUV.
