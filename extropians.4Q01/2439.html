<p>Hmmmm...  Well this post from Daniel:
<br>
<a href="http://forum.javien.com/future/XMLmessage.php?id=id::ITNoeUE4-HQgP-Uwom-CSdx-VkBNCUFqXTEx">http://forum.javien.com/future/XMLmessage.php?id=id::ITNoeUE4-HQgP-Uwom-CSdx-VkBNCUFqXTEx</a>
<br>
<p>clearly points out that we have been stirring the stew.
<br>
<p>Now what I don't know is the degree to which the CIA and/or
<br>
military was doing most of the stirring with the full knowledge
<br>
and support of the various administrations in power or whether
<br>
from 1945-1995 they were just executing &quot;cold war policy&quot; the
<br>
best way they knew how (and now we are still suffering the
<br>
fallout).
<br>
<p>The part I find so humourous about the piece is the degree that
<br>
America seemed to be acting against French or British interests
<br>
and the degree to which we are &quot;good buddies&quot; today.  I'm unsure
<br>
of the time when America went from becoming an oil producer to
<br>
an oil importer, but I cannot believe the &quot;oil&quot; addiction would
<br>
be the driving factor up until the mid-1970's when the oil embargoes
<br>
showed how vulnerable we are.
<br>
<p>I'll point out for Amara that the *reason* that the soil of
<br>
Europe is drenched in blood is that Europe had a multi-hundred
<br>
year history of lesser royalty, monarchs and emperors using military
<br>
force to *conquer* regions with differing allegiances -- it goes back
<br>
all the way through the Ottoman empire to the Crusades and perhaps
<br>
even the Roman empire to the Greek city-states.
<br>
<p>I think the lessons of history are plain -- ignore the desires
<br>
of megalomaniacs at your own peril.
<br>
<p>Here is the question for Amara, Samantha or others who think
<br>
the U.S. current approach is ill-conceived -- If the U.S.
<br>
immediately pulled out of Saudi Arabia, allowing Bin Laden
<br>
to initiate a full revolt of the poor, unmarried young male
<br>
population so as to depose the royal family and install himself
<br>
as a leader of a hard line Islamic state -- *Do* you think he
<br>
would stop there?!?  Once he had the Saudi oil fields is there
<br>
any reason he should not use that card to keep Europe and the
<br>
U.S. out of the Mid-East while he proceeds to fund and supply
<br>
bodies to overthrow the government of Egypt (3x the population
<br>
of Saudi Arabia), continue on to retake Israel from the infidel
<br>
Jews (returning it to an Arabic state) and launching a campaign
<br>
to wrest Kashmir from India?
<br>
<p>Now, do you really think that Israel and India (both nuclear
<br>
powers) are going to sit around and allow that to occur?
<br>
