<p>No.  Eliezer has it right.  Attempt to &quot;define&quot; spirituality in such
<br>
terms that one can think about it and potentially subject it to study.
<br>
Never fail to remember that our current &quot;picture&quot; of reality in terms
<br>
of physical laws is grossly insufficient.  So long as it remains that
<br>
way we should be open-minded about looking at all of the bets on the
<br>
table.  I mean really!  Physical constants changing over time?
<br>
Violations of laws of conservation?  No &quot;causality&quot; for why this
<br>
universe came to be and how we came to exist in it?  A terribly
<br>
bleek outcome for the universe unless intelligence intervenes?
<br>
Etc. etc.
<br>
<p>I'd list &quot;spirituality&quot; as 7 out of 10 on my list of things that
<br>
serious extropians should be &quot;concerned&quot; about.  It could well
<br>
be an &quot;emergent&quot; property of complex minds.  It could also be
<br>
an artifact (or design feature) of a simulation in which we might
<br>
be running.  It could also be nothing more than an emotional
<br>
gestalt of an experience of &quot;security&quot; and/or &quot;perfection&quot;.
<br>
<p>Take a look at the recent Dutch study of Near-Death Experiances.
<br>
They took a &quot;non-scientific&quot; observation and subjected it to
<br>
scientific analysis.  What did they conclude?  That ~10% of
<br>
subjects experienced something.  Does that make me &quot;belive&quot;
<br>
in the conclusions of NDE &quot;witnesses&quot;?  No.  Does that make
<br>
me want to understand the physiology of their brains and/or
<br>
the genetic background of such individuals?  Yes!
<br>
I don't want to deny their experiences, I want to know
<br>
why their experiences are &quot;different&quot;!
<br>
<p>I can put NDEs, spirituality and Aperger's Syndrome all in
<br>
the same boat -- phenomena with are experienced by specific
<br>
individuals which may have genetic or experiential causation
<br>
components.  Denying them is useless.  Explaining or studying
<br>
their causes is potentially useful.
