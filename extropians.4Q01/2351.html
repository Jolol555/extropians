<em>&gt; Indeed. Leaving aside all questions of cinematic preferences for the

</em><br>
<p>To quote from Douglas Adam's &quot;The Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul&quot;:
<br>
<p>**
<br>
<p>When asked about the famous principle passed down by the
<br>
estimable character of Sherlock Holmes, &quot;Once you have
<br>
discounted the impossible, then whatever remains, however
<br>
improbable, must be the truth,&quot; Dirk Gently answers sharply:
<br>
<p>&quot;I reject that entirely.  The impossible often has a kind of
<br>
integrity to it which the merely improbable lacks. How often
<br>
have you been presented with an apparently rational
<br>
explanation of something that works in all respects other
<br>
than one, which is just that it is hopelessly improbable? Your
<br>
instinct is to say, 'Yes, but he or she wouldn't do that.'&quot; 
<br>
<p>Dirk is reminded of a girl in a wheelchair whom we meet
<br>
earlier in the story, capable of quoting, minute for minute,
<br>
yesterday's stock market prices. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Ah yes...your girl in the wheelchair--a perfect example. The
<br>
idea that she is somehow receiving yesterday's stock market
<br>
prices apparently out of thin air is merely impossible, and
<br>
therefore must be the case, because the idea that she is
<br>
maintaining an immensely complex and laborious hoax of no
<br>
benefit to herself is hopelessly improbable. The first idea
<br>
merely supposes that there is something that we don't know
<br>
about, and God knows there are enough of those. The
<br>
second, however, runs contrary to something fundamental
<br>
and human which we do know about. We should therefore
<br>
be suspicious of it and all its specious rationality.&quot;
<br>
<p>**
<br>
<p>Which is why everyone hates midichlorians.
<br>
<p>If the Force is merely something impossible, it can make sense.  If the
<br>
Force is supposed to be explicable then midichlorians are an absolutely
<br>
lousy explanation.  The Force as an impossibility has integrity; the Force
<br>
as midichlorians is hopelessly improbable.
<br>
<p>The Force clearly has a moral component.  The midichlorians are a morally
<br>
neutral explanation.  Not only does this interfere with the drama of the
<br>
series by subtracting all possible moral significance from who has the
<br>
Force and how much of the Force they have - and this is *direct*
<br>
interference; contradiction of drama, not explaining away drama - it also
<br>
makes midichlorians an inadequate explanation for the observed phenomenon
<br>
that is the Force.
<br>
<p>Midichlorians are a simon-pure, 24-carat example of specious rationality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's worth musing on this observable effect, I think. I now expect to read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dozen rants explaining why *knowing* is better than *nescience*, and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfying, and more deeply numinous than nay-saying ignorant bullshit...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the fact is, it often isn't experienced that way. We might need to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this into account.
</em><br>
<p>I think it depends on the explanation.  Knowing that the sky is blue
<br>
because of how the air scatters different frequencies is a dull
<br>
explanation.  Knowing that the sky appears to be a pure chromatic color
<br>
because of how our eyes have evolved to maintain color constancy under
<br>
variances in natural lighting is a deep explanation, and one that confirms
<br>
and upholds the sapphire beauty of the sky rather than appearing to
<br>
&quot;explain it away&quot;.
