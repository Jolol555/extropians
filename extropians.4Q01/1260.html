Subject: Semantic Web: Beyond Metadata
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Smarter Web Update
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.techreview.com/magazine/nov01/frauenfelder.asp">http://www.techreview.com/magazine/nov01/frauenfelder.asp</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't have a Semantic Web without metadata, but metadata alone won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffice. The metadata in Web pages will have to be linked to special
</em><br>
documents
<br>
<em>&gt; that define metadata terms and the relationships between the terms. These
</em><br>
sets
<br>
<em>&gt; of shared concepts and their interconnections are called &quot;ontologies.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Say, for example, that you've made a Web page listing the members of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faculty. You would tag the names of the different members with metadata
</em><br>
terms
<br>
<em>&gt; such as &quot;chair,&quot; &quot;associate professor,&quot; &quot;professor&quot; and so on. Then you'd
</em><br>
link
<br>
<em>&gt; the page to an ontology-one that you created yourself or one that someone
</em><br>
else
<br>
<em>&gt; has already made-that defines educational job positions and how they
</em><br>
relate to
<br>
<em>&gt; each other. An appropriate ontology would in this case define a chair as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person, not a thing you sit on, and it would indicate that a chair is the
</em><br>
most
<br>
<em>&gt; senior position in a department.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By defining the relationships between terms, ontologies can then be used
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; applications to infer new facts. Suppose you have created a Web page that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teaches schoolchildren about condors, and have added metadata to the
</em><br>
content.
<br>
<em>&gt; You could link to an ontology (or more likely, several ontologies) that
</em><br>
define
<br>
<em>&gt; the various terms and their relationships: &quot;California condor is a type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condor from California.&quot; &quot;Condor is a member of the raptor family.&quot; &quot;All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raptors are carnivores.&quot; &quot;California is a state in the United States.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Carnivores are meat eaters.&quot; By using both metadata and ontologies, a
</em><br>
search
<br>
<em>&gt; engine or other software agent could find your condor site based on a
</em><br>
search
<br>
<em>&gt; request for &quot;carnivores in the U.S.&quot;-even if your site made no mention of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carnivores or the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because ontology development is a big undertaking, it's likely that site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creators will link to third-party ontologies. Some will be free, others
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; be sold or licensed. One issue that will have to be confronted: just as
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; dictionaries and atlases, political and cultural bias will creep into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ontologies. A geography-based ontology maintained by the Chinese
</em><br>
government,
<br>
<em>&gt; for instance, would probably not define Taiwan as a &quot;country.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that hardly impedes the vision. As the World Wide Web Consortium
</em><br>
continues
<br>
<em>&gt; to develop standards and technologies for the Semantic Web, hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations, companies and individuals are contributing to the effort by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating tools, languages and ontologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One major contributor is DARPA-the folks responsible for a great deal of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; technology behind the Internet (see &quot;DARPA's Disruptive Technologies,&quot; TR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; October 2001). These days, DARPA is contributing tens of millions of
</em><br>
dollars
<br>
<em>&gt; to the Web consortium's Semantic Web project and has developed a semantic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language for the U.S. Department of Defense called DARPA Agent Markup
</em><br>
Language
<br>
<em>&gt; that allows users to add metadata to Web documents and relate it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ontologies. University of Maryland computer science professor Jim
</em><br>
Hendler-who
<br>
<em>&gt; was until August manager of the DARPA program-has been working closely
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; Berners-Lee and Miller to ensure consistency with the consortium's
</em><br>
efforts.
<br>
<em>&gt; Last December, Hendler announced the creation of a language that combines
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; DARPA Agent Markup Language's capabilities with an ontology language,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed in Europe, called OIL (which stands for both Ontology Inference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Layer and Ontology Interchange Language).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A developer of this new language, University of Manchester lecturer Ian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Horrocks, also advises the World Wide Web Consortium on the Semantic Web.
</em><br>
In
<br>
<em>&gt; January, he cofounded a company called Network Inference to develop
</em><br>
technology
<br>
<em>&gt; that uses ontologies and automated inference to give Semantic Web
</em><br>
capabilities
<br>
<em>&gt; to existing relational databases and large Web sites. Recently, an Isle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Man-based data services company called PDMS began using Network
</em><br>
Inference's
<br>
<em>&gt; technology to add Semantic Web capabilities to corporate databases. Dozens
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; other companies, from Hewlett-Packard to Nokia, are contributing to
</em><br>
Semantic
<br>
<em>&gt; Web development
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Too Much, Too Late?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Miller believes the seamless flow and integration of information resulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from these moves will make it possible to process knowledge in a way &quot;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solves problems, brings people closer and spurs on new ideas that never
</em><br>
could
<br>
<em>&gt; happen before.&quot; Others, though, are not so optimistic about the Semantic
</em><br>
Web.
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's rather ambitious,&quot; says R. V. Guha, who led development of the Web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consortium's Resource Description Framework efforts in the late 1990s.
</em><br>
(This
<br>
<em>&gt; framework is an essential tool for describing and sharing metadata.) &quot;It
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; be nice if such things existed,&quot; he says, &quot;but there are some really hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research problems that need to be solved first.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One issue concerns inference. The time it takes a computer to draw new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions from data, metadata and ontologies on the Web increases
</em><br>
rapidly as
<br>
<em>&gt; rules are added to a system. Inference falls into the same category as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classic &quot;traveling-salesman problem&quot; of planning the shortest route
</em><br>
through a
<br>
<em>&gt; number of cities. It's not hard to figure out the best of all possible
</em><br>
routes
<br>
<em>&gt; when you're dealing with just a very few locations. But when you get up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only 15 cities, there are more than 43 billion possible routes. The same
</em><br>
kind
<br>
<em>&gt; of runaway situation exists for inference, where brute-force searches for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers could lead to time-wasting paradoxes or contradictions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And even if Berners-Lee and his cohorts meet the technical challenges,
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; won't be enough for the Semantic Web to click into place. There is a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question as to whether people will think the benefits are worth the extra
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort of adding metadata to their content in the first place. One reason
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Web became so wildly successful, after all, was its sublime ease of
</em><br>
creation.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The Web today is the simplest, most primitive form of hypertext,&quot; says
</em><br>
former
<br>
<em>&gt; Sun Microsystems Distinguished Engineer Jakob Nielsen, cofounder of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nielsen Norman Group, a Web design firm in Fremont, CA. &quot;And that's why it
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; so easy to implement; that's why everybody could...start putting up their
</em><br>
own
<br>
<em>&gt; Web pages; that's why the Web is so big.&quot; However, while most people may
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; comfortable doing simplistic editing, such as marking a text as &quot;bold,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nielsen points out, &quot;They cannot do semantic editing, where they say,
</em><br>
'This is
<br>
<em>&gt; the author's name,' or 'This is the name of people I'm quoting.'&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, such pessimism may be ignoring recent history. Not so long ago,
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; notion of millions of people learning to write HTML code seemed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far-fetched-yet that's exactly what happened. Still, the hurdle of
</em><br>
creating a
<br>
<em>&gt; Semantic Web will be higher. People can use HTML any way they want. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonly use tables for nontabular purposes, for instance, and slap on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;subhead&quot; tag merely to apply boldface. These kluges and shortcuts usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have only cosmetic consequences. But the same type of fudging-say, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employing &quot;bibliography&quot; tags to list a DVD collection-could make a page's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metadata unusable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that metadata wasn't implemented right from the Web's start could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also make it harder for the Semantic Web to gain acceptance. One
</em><br>
particularly
<br>
<em>&gt; tough skeptic is Peter Merholz, cofounder of Adaptive Path, a San
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Francisco-based user experience consultancy. &quot;This stuff has to be baked
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; from the beginning,&quot; says Merholz, who calls the Semantic Web &quot;an
</em><br>
interesting
<br>
<em>&gt; academic pursuit&quot; with little bearing on society. &quot;The Semantic Web is
</em><br>
getting
<br>
<em>&gt; a lot of hype simply because Tim Berners-Lee-the inventor of the World
</em><br>
Wide
<br>
<em>&gt; Web-is so interested in it,&quot; he says. &quot;If it were just some schmuck at
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; university in Indiana, nobody would care.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initial Threads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even Berners-Lee admits that the path to the Semantic Web may be a bit
</em><br>
slower
<br>
<em>&gt; than that to the World Wide Web. &quot;In a way we don't need to move too
</em><br>
fast,&quot; he
<br>
<em>&gt; says, &quot;because the theory people need to look at it to make sure we're not
</em><br>
too
<br>
<em>&gt; crazy, and other people need to check out the ideas in practice before
</em><br>
they're
<br>
<em>&gt; picked up and used too extensively.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When asked to peek into his crystal ball, the evangelist of exchangeable
</em><br>
data
<br>
<em>&gt; predicts that some of the Semantic Web's first commercial applications
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; aim to integrate the different information systems that typically coexist
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; large organizations. (Wouldn't it be nice to take care of business at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motor vehicle department or hospital without having to fill out a
</em><br>
half-dozen
<br>
<em>&gt; largely redundant forms? The Semantic Web can help here.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And even though the Semantic Web still resides chiefly on the drawing
</em><br>
board,
<br>
<em>&gt; you can see hints of its power on some existing Web sites. Consider
</em><br>
Moreover
<br>
<em>&gt; Technologies' search engine that crawls thousands of news sites several
</em><br>
times
<br>
<em>&gt; a day, making it a favorite for news junkies. Moreover's software agents
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; been programmed to look at the font tags (the HTML labels that tell Web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; browsers how large or small to make the text appear on the screen) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine whether or not a particular page is a news story. If a Moreover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent finds a string of six to 18 words tagged as large type near the top
</em><br>
of a
<br>
<em>&gt; page, it will assume it is a headline and place it in a database. Of
</em><br>
course,
<br>
<em>&gt; since the agent is only making a guess, sometimes it selects a page that
</em><br>
isn't
<br>
<em>&gt; news after all. So Moreover has to apply additional filtering to get rid
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; pages that don't contain articles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's still a far cry from the ultimate goal-but it's a good start. And
</em><br>
even
<br>
<em>&gt; the Semantic Web champions don't pretend to grasp exactly where such steps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will lead. After all, who predicted Amazon.com or eBay back when
</em><br>
Berners-Lee
<br>
<em>&gt; turned on the switch of the world's first Web server in December 1990?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the point is that people want more intelligence from the Web than
</em><br>
they're
<br>
<em>&gt; getting-and a growing number of computer scientists share the twinkle in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Berners-Lee's eye, and the feeling that the Semantic Web holds the answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's great,&quot; says the inventor of the World Wide Web, &quot;to have that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grass-roots enthusiasm around again.&quot;
</em><br>
