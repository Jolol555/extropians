<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;You can see it work everywhere when you know how&quot; is needless to say a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perceptible gap, an observed effect without a hypothesized cause, and this

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spirituality.  Where is the corresponding gap in my worldview that needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; filling?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't really do a &quot;God of the Gaps&quot;.  But experentially,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophically and even intellectually I have experienced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe there exist big-M Mind that we can sometimes experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; linkage with.  One way to &quot;get there from here&quot; is to imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what happens a bit after you get a Singularity and the SI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuously expands and integrates beyond what even we might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe possible.  That Mind very well might do some things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create these additional strange loops like travel backward and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward in its own timeline influencing and permeating its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming, or creating complete new Universes and new sentients
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in such a way that it can and does provide some nudges along the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way and can in some circumstances be partially accessed. 
</em><br>
<p>There's no reason why closed timelike curve technology would be just
<br>
powerful enough to implant little hints into our day-to-day minds, and not
<br>
vastly more powerful or vastly weaker.  On the other hand, the theory that
<br>
says &quot;It's just your imagination&quot; does predict, very precisely, that the
<br>
proponents of this meme will assert a level of influence which is great
<br>
enough to have alleged moral impact, but not great enough to be
<br>
falsifiable.  In other words, hint-dropping.  If there really is a future
<br>
Mind with technology capable of supervening on present-day reality to the
<br>
extent of influencing human cognition, and that Mind cares enough to
<br>
intervene, I would expect the effects to be large, blatant, and
<br>
noticeable.  For that matter, the degree of physical supervenience needed
<br>
to drop hints is probably sufficient to construct nanobot servos.  If you
<br>
can tweak a neuron firing you can probably tweak a protein folding.
<br>
<p>But anyway, this hypothesis about reality - that spirituality represents
<br>
drawing on a real, external source of knowledge, where this knowledge is
<br>
more accessible to humans who place themselves in particular emotional
<br>
states - is a straightforward one, and one to which I can
<br>
straightforwardly reply &quot;You're wrong.&quot;  And you can reply &quot;You're
<br>
wrong.&quot;  And there, I think, things rest, unless you'd like me to try and
<br>
unlace your faith.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to look at spirituality is the search for and acheiving of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some bit of such access.  Another way to look at it is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projection of the greatest dreams, hopes and determination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity projected as already existent and of help.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projection can greatly help us focus and move forward even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you only believe it is a projection.   It is timeless by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction.
</em><br>
<p>In what way is a &quot;projection of the greatest dreams, hopes, and
<br>
determination of humanity&quot; mystical?  We have dreams, we have hopes, we
<br>
have determination.  I try to nurture it in myself and others.  I don't
<br>
need to break the laws of physics in order to do so.
<br>
<p>As you know, Samantha, I'm not as violent a critic of all that seems or
<br>
can be labeled &quot;spiritual&quot; as most of those on the Extropian list.  I
<br>
think it's legitimate to say, for example, that the Singularity is
<br>
intended &quot;to heal the darkness in the human spirit&quot;, because I can, if
<br>
necessary, define exactly what I mean by 'darkness' and why I expect the
<br>
Singularity to heal it.  In other words, the &quot;spiritual&quot; statement is here
<br>
a legitimate approximation to a more specific and technical argument. 
<br>
Since the vague images invoked by &quot;heal the darkness in the human spirit&quot;
<br>
are actually in good accord with these specifics, and since the emotions
<br>
invoked center on goals which I myself share, I judge it ethical to use
<br>
that phrase in explaining the Singularity to a nontechnical audience.  As
<br>
a matter of pragmatism, I wouldn't use that phrase in front of an
<br>
Extropian conference, or even a computer conference, because I know that a
<br>
majority or sizeable minority (respectively) will be very strongly
<br>
allergic to any argument that uses a spiritual phrasing, and also that
<br>
academic audiences view spiritual argument as a special case with specific
<br>
connotations.
<br>
<p>Spiritual shorthand is ethical where it arrives at a correct conclusion
<br>
*for correct reasons*, where any emotional appeal is based on shared
<br>
goals, and where more specific arguments can't be used due to constraints
<br>
on time or audience.  But I don't think the shorthand is more powerful.  I
<br>
think it's shorter.
<br>
<p>Mystical argument, though, is always incorrect - it invokes causes and
<br>
effects which do not exist in reality.  Only someone who genuinely
<br>
believes in those causes and effects can ethically use a mystical
<br>
argument.
