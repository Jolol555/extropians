<br>
<em>&gt; You are referring to the difference between the short term and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;long  term goals.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I am actually referring to the difference between what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe we are about and what our officials say we are about. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They do not mesh.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the long term goal will fail also but not because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political bickering, although that will be what it looks like is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occurring.  It will fail because it is ill-defined, nebulous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never-ending and hideously expensive in life, dollars and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well-being of &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; and counter to our best visions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the world we wish to build. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I think you raise some excellent ancillary points as to why it will
<br>
fail. I think you underestimate the political aspect though.
<br>
<p>I think it's a good idea for people who want peace to act together,
<br>
but this does not mean ignoring violent acts or those that cause
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Will they be satisfied when/if 4.5 million Afghanis die of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starvation this winter?  Cycles of terror are maintained by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incident/vengeance/counter-vengeance.  At some point the causes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the entire pattern must be addressed outside of vengeance if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is to have an end.  Vengeance is understandable but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;always productive.
</em><br>
<p>I said there was a vengeance aspect to this, but it is not entirely
<br>
about vengeance. The best hope for millions of Afghanis is if we
<br>
eliminate the Taliban, preferably as quickly as possible.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yes, and if we had anti-gravity and teleportation we could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really accomplish the miraculous!  Seriously, there is no way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by force destroy terrorism and what it grows from.  It is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dangerous fallacy to belief this can be done.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree. What makes the current situation unique was not Bin
<br>
Laden, but Bin Ladens MONEY.That and the fact the Taliban who share
<br>
a common vision with him gave him sanctuary.
<br>
<p>It is our intebt to eliminate both of these factors from the
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps you have been spoonfed material that supports this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notion or makes it easy to come too.  But it ignores that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;region has been massively manipulated by the US and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries in ways that have been detrimental to the people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against our own principles in many cases.  It ignores that many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the area have good reason to be angry at US.  In that way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respect it is certainly simplistic.  But when I or others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attempt to bring out those reasons we are considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anti-patriotic or not behind the &quot;righteous&quot; &quot;war&quot; sufficiently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leftist and so on.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't agree that they have a case against us, but it is
<br>
irrelevant. The issue is that we were attacked, and we will always
<br>
respond.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Do you care if we have acted and are acting like international
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bullies and destroying homes/lifes/countries for reasons that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will greatly anger and disgust you?  
</em><br>
<p>The government has done some questionable things in the past, none
<br>
of which justifies the attack against us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Do you care whether we live our ideals outside the US as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inside?  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Our ideals&quot; I think your talking 250 million or so different
<br>
versions of this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you care whether we become an armed camp in order to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorist attacks?
</em><br>
<p>The best way to prevent this is to destroy those who've attacked us
<br>
and make it clear any further attempts will have the same results.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Al Jazeera is an Islamic media tabloid. They feed the population
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exactly what they want to hear.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I see.  And our media does not uh?
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe I was defending our media. Not likely to either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course not.  You only care, judging from the above, about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vengeance and proving it will cost a lot to ever poke the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again.  Doesn't that seem like a tad provincial attitude?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't see anything provincial about it, and I do care about a
<br>
great deal more.
<br>
<p>But I do think destroying those responsible and making it clear we
<br>
will do so again is the best policy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How many have risen up in his place?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As I said what made this situation unique was Bin Laden's money and
<br>
the santuary the Taliban gave him.
<br>
<p>We have learned, at great price, many valuable lessons. I hope we
<br>
apply them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I don't refuse to consider it.  I simply point out it is not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the problem or as much of the problem as you seem to want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make it out to be and that attempting to forcefully end that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;source of the problem&quot; will not work.   Do you belief we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spread our own falsehoods and half-truths btw?  The idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the lies they tell about us plus religious fanaticism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficient to explain their hatred and terrorist actions IS such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a falsehood and half-truth.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
They can believe whatever they like. I suggest they also pay close
<br>
attention and &quot;believe&quot; there will be hell to pay for attacking the
<br>
U.S.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So.  Does your enlightenment extend to western media?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't waste my time with mass media.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I see.  Regardless of actual guilt in the one incident you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you are about addressing, you have picked parties to destroy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;order to satisfy vengeance, provide a lasting image of our power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and believe you (plural) have actually addressed and finished
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the issue.  Got it.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
No you don't. We know who these people are, we know where they've
<br>
been, we know who their associates are, we know where the money
<br>
came from.
<br>
<p>They work for Bin Laden.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Really?  Guilt by association is sufficient?  Associates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involved in one attack on X are suficient to believe all attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on X are the work of bin Laden?  Whatever.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My fault, I made it too simplistic, see above.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The Taliban allowed Bin Laden to have his terrorist bases there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they are in complicity with Al-Quaeda, and will now share their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fate.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Interesting.  What of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, and so on who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at one time or another thought the Al-Quaeda network was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasonable think to partially support?  
</em><br>
<p>Actually bringing these elements to task for their support is a
<br>
good idea.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Really, I find this sort of reasoning quite empty even granting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the assumption fundamental assumption.
</em><br>
<p>Most civilized law codes agree with me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;They are very well entrenched and have a fair amount of popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support within Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;area even now.  The civilian populations that are within and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their supporters will die in large numbers if you been by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;destroying the Taliban&quot; destroying all who consider themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Taliban.  If you mean only removing them from power many will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still die but not as many.  So which do you mean?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
They will not be entrenched for long. I am talking about
<br>
Afghanistan only. For the moment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; We will pursue Al-Qaeda wherever they exist, countries that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; terrorist bases (Sudan) may face military action. But I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the current plan is to use agents in other places.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I see.  So much for yuur early seeming claim we were only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involved in Afghanistan and then would go home.  Will you then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;go after Hammas and other groups?  Do you think you can end or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eviscerate so much anger by militarily finding the most actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;angry and killing them and inflicting whatever &quot;collateral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damage&quot; it takes?  To me this is a very very dangerous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;twisted fallacy that can do nothing but much more seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inflame the world and endanger all of us (all of humanity not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just us) and what we hold most dear.  
</em><br>
<p>Do you think you can placate these groups and they will all go
<br>
away? And at what price?
