Ever wonder if those claiming to be rational have an agenda?  
<br>
<p>What happens when rational people with different goals interact, each making his own decisions on the basis of what is best for him - while taking into account that the others are doing the same. &quot;Rationality and interactive decision theory underline much of economic theory and have had an important impact on such diverse areas as evolutionary biology, political science, computer science, the artworld, social psychology, law, statistics, philosophy and the foundations of mathematics.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Is anyone really rational All the time?
<br>
<p>The Judging - Perceiving scale is probably the most difficult to identify. In order to better understand this scale one must first comprehend the fundamental differences between rational and irrational behaviour.
<br>
<p>&quot;*Rational behaviour
<br>
<p>Rational behaviour is common practice for Judging types, however may be sometimes noticed in Perceiving types too, analogously to introverts showing extroverted behaviour and vice versa. Judging types are often called Rational types and Perceiving are called Irrational. The main difference between them is the different way that they are motivated into activity or deal with different tasks. Look at the animation showing the principal of rational behaviour (J-Judging type, O-Obstacle). Judging types usually plan their actions beforehand and try to follow this plan. They tend to choose the shortest distance to the target moving along in a direct line. In a stable atmosphere this behaviour is optimal because it allows Judging types to calculate the most optimal life. However, a changing situation causes Judging types trouble with fulfilling their plans. These changes put more obstacles in the way, which as a result cause Judging types to put the execution of their plans on hold for an indefinite period of time u<br>
ntil either the obstacle moves away by itself or another decision alters their plans prompting them to change direction. This is explained by the fact that Judging types have judging elements present at the information inputs. These elements will not allow information to pass through until a decision to act is made. Regular alternation of plans is irritating for Judging types and as a result they cope badly with situations containing a high irrationality factor.&quot;
<br>
<p>What about the idea that those who judge not being able to perceive?  (I don't think so._  Are those who perceive not able to judge?  (Don't think so.)  It is not that cut and dry.
<br>
<p>&quot;*Irrational behaviour
<br>
<p>Irrational behaviour is associated with Perceiving types but sometimes can be noticed in Judging types too. Look at the animation showing irrational behaviour (P-Perceiving type, O-Obstacle). It may seem that Perceiving types have no definite aims or goals to achieve in comparison with Judging types. This is because irrational behaviour is like a freehand line. Perceiving types flow with changes. It seems as if they feel oncoming change long before Judging types can even see it. As a result they avoid obstacles in their way with virtuosity. Perceiving types meet information with perceiving elements at the information inputs. These elements allow information to pass through freely. Decisions made at this point are not concrete and can be easily altered. In situations with a high factor of rationality, Perceiving types are forced to straighten their freehand lines, restricting their free-flow. It may also affect their overall perception of situations, which often results in them making mistakes. 
<br>
<p>In conclusion, the difference in Judging-Perceiving causes a great deal of friction in close relationships. The irrational behaviour of Perceiving types may be unexpected and unpredictable for Judging types, creating more obstacles. In return, the rational behaviour of Judging types forces Perceiving types to follow rules, plans and schedules which will most likely make their life miserable.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, gee I rather like being able to become aware with the use of my senses.  What about you?  It seems irrational to separate perception from judgment, given our history and our future.
