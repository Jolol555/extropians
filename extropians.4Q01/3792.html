<p>Well, its not just you. Most &quot;mainstream economists&quot;- Marxians, Keynesians, Neo-Keynesians, etc. are necessarily 'nutty', as these
<br>
kinds of theories are consistently refuted by the experimental evidence. (&quot;Feminist Economics&quot; sounds like a Marxian polylogist
<br>
spinoff. I've never heard of it before). It's sort of like a giant Stanford Experiment- those willing to forgo rationation and
<br>
regurgitate the Party line (e.g.the State cares about you, counterfeiting money is good, mommy.gov knows best) are rewarded. Some
<br>
even get Nobel prizes for introducing new epicycles.
<br>

<br>
<p>An example of Ptolemaic monetary theory, from a Sept 2001 publication of a Federal Reserve bank-
<br>
<p>&quot;...
<br>
(1) Yg|t=a*Yg|(t -1)+b*E|t*(Yg|(t+1))- c*[R|t- E|t*( p|(t+1))]+x|t
<br>
[plus two other equations in r*, z|t, etc. in this system. z|t means &quot;z subscript t&quot;]
<br>
<p>&quot;where Yg|t equals the output gap (the percentage
<br>
point difference between actual and potential
<br>
output), R equals nominal interest rate, r* equals
<br>
equilibrium real interest rate, p equals inflation, p|T
<br>
equals inflation target, x and z are stochastic
<br>
shocks, and all the coefficients are positive....&quot;
<br>
<p>Rearranging terms, we have:
<br>
<p>x|t=Yg|t-a*Yg|(t -1)-b*E|t*(Yg|(t+1))+ c*[R|t- E|t*( p|(t+1))]
<br>
<p>which could then be used to predict that mysterious &quot;stochastic shock&quot;.
<br>
<p>An engineer using Newton's laws of motion might be tempted to make an adjustment to
<br>
F=ma
<br>
(force identifies with mass time acceleration), say  to
<br>
F=m/v + x|t
<br>
(force is mass divided by velocity plus some mysterious, time-dependent &quot;stochastic shock&quot;)
<br>
Other engineers would consider this individual to be a nut case, of course.
<br>
<p>Speaking of &quot;stochastic shocks&quot; and the partial predictability of human action-
<br>
<p>a prediction from November 7, 2000-
<br>
&nbsp;&quot; Banks [in the US] may take another little &quot;holiday&quot;- meaning depositors cannot withdraw, as in the 1930's and 1980's S&amp;L debacle.
<br>
This would be done in part to put a brake on price-hyperinflation, at the little guy's expense of course (science!).&quot;

&quot;Banking restrictions decreed by President Fernando de la Rúa on Saturday [December 1, 2001] come into effect today. The President
<br>
and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said on national television last night the measures were taken to fight &quot;an enormous
<br>
speculative attack&quot; against Argentina.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's right, blame anybody else besides the guys running the nuclear-powered currency-printing press.

<br>
<p>&quot;...These were designed to stop a bank run which on Friday seemed to be leading to financial collapse. &quot;We have come out to defend
<br>
ourselves,&quot; said De la Rúa in a three-minute TV address. &quot;National unity is today more important than ever.&quot; ...The measures include
<br>
a 250-peso or dollar cap on the funds account holders can withdraw in cash every week. &quot;I apologize because I know many of you
<br>
became scared by the measures. But we are doing this to defend your savings...&quot;
<br>
<p>Um hmmm...

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;...Economists, businessmen and analysts were not so optimistic. &quot;If there's one sector that benefits from this, it's banks,&quot; said
<br>
Rafael Ber, an analyst for Argentine Research consultancy. .... &quot;There will be a ferocious decline in local economic activity.&quot;
<br>
&quot;These measures constitute an inadmissible infringement of property rights and they bring us one step closer to a 'hyper-recession'
<br>
,&quot; the Argentine business group CAME said in a statement. (Herald staff with news agencies)  &quot;
<br>

<br>
&quot;Passengers on planes and ships were frisked for illegal dollar stashes before leaving the country. The decree sparked fears of an
<br>
imminent devaluation of the peso, wiping out savings overnight. The run on the banks was only the latest sign that the financial
<br>
crisis that has rocked Latin America's third-largest economy for the past four years shows no signs of abating.&quot;

<p><em>&gt; Sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the groups are not that weird (like Austrian Economics, which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a hard time viewing as reallt heterodox), but how do you judge the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality of abstracts when their methods, epistemology and quite possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their entire metaphysics is up to the submitter to define?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps a better perspective would be &quot;transhumanist economics =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics seen from the perspective of continuing, dynamist, radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change&quot;. The economy is changing *together* with society, culture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology and humanity, and the goal of transhumanist economy is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyse how this change behaves. It would naturally have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transdisciplinary, and it is likely extremely hard to do much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantitative economics this way, but there might be valuable qualitative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insights in a perspective that tried to look at how economies behave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they are constantly forced by internal and external factors to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapt and evolve. Or have I just reinvented one of the [theories of economics] on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call for submission list above?
</em><br>
<p>It is part and parcel of Austrian School thinking. As for &quot;quantitave economics&quot;, when you see an equation with e.g GDP or K (for
<br>
total capital) in it, and even first and second derivatives of same, be advised you are looking at the result of poor thinking.
