Dickey, Michael F wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; Sincerely, I hate to bring this subject up again, but it has been running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through my mind.
</em><br>
<p>This is an extremely important question.  It is crucial to our long-term
<br>
survival beyond our current lifespans.  If we cannot answer this question
<br>
satisfactorily, we will never develop a solution that is acceptable to most
<br>
people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems a good number of the people on this list support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the assertion that a copy is 'you'.  I have been taking the stance (along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a minority it appears) that a copy is not you, but it is a copy.
</em><br>
<p>There are many people on both sides of the argument.  You are not alone in
<br>
your viewpoint.  There seems to be no obvious answer.  The decision of what
<br>
you consider &quot;you&quot; seems to be different with different people.  Some call
<br>
anything that is functionally like themselves another &quot;me&quot;.  Other people
<br>
feel attached to their current seat of consciousness and will not consider
<br>
an identical copy the same &quot;me&quot; if they still feel themselves trapped in the
<br>
original body rather than the copy.  These concepts become murkier if the
<br>
original is killed and replaced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; consider everyone I have interacted with and read posts from on this forum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very intelligent, and the lack of interest in this subject or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responding to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my arguments suggest, to me at least, that perhaps my stance is wrong.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so many well learned people do not consider the question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reply to, then perhaps they know something that I do not.
</em><br>
<p>No, I personally believe you are right.  Many people on this list also agree
<br>
with you.  However, we have gone through this discussion many times.  Many
<br>
of the older participants don't know what more can be said that hasn't been
<br>
said before.  That is why my brother and I are trying to do a lot of
<br>
independent work offline to figure out how to discuss the question
<br>
differently.  So far, our ideas have lead to a classification scheme of
<br>
different levels of copies.  Then we hope to be able to discuss the topic
<br>
with more precise terms.  We can't discuss &quot;you&quot; or &quot;me&quot;, because different
<br>
people disagree on these terms.  We can't discuss the &quot;original&quot; and the
<br>
&quot;copy&quot;, because some people dispute that they are separate.  If we could
<br>
find objective terminology to reference different instances of a person, we
<br>
might be able to talk more clearly.  I still personally believe that the
<br>
decision will boil down to a personal choice.  Some people will say they
<br>
will be happy with a certain level of copy replacing themselves, while
<br>
others will require a much higher standard before they consider such a
<br>
replacement to be acceptable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I, for one, cannot see the slightest value in &quot;continuity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness&quot;, whatever that is.  How is being destroyed and restored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a backup any different from the perfectly ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a whack on the head a waking up a few minutes later?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Its *you* as of the time of the backup if the backup and restoration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methods are completely loss less.  Any other perspective is to argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; has some basis in non-physical phenomena.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This is an interesting paradox of this discussion.  Both sides fail to see
<br>
the other viewpoint, and both sides think the other viewpoint requires some
<br>
basis in non-physical phenomena.  If an atom-per-atom copy is still not the
<br>
same &quot;you&quot;, it seems to opponents that you think that something has not been
<br>
copied that does not consist of atoms.  If the connection of &quot;you&quot; that you
<br>
feel to your current self suddenly jumps to another location because it
<br>
happens to have a similar configuration of atoms, opponents of that theory
<br>
think there is a soul jumping from body to body.  Either explanation fails
<br>
to satisfy its opponents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I feel I have to delve into philosophy of science a little bit here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Getting copied in a destructive manner is different from getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whacked on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the head and waking up a few minutes later in a few key areas 1) getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whacked on the head does not destroy you 2) and the mechanism that houses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your consciousness never changes.  There is no reason to suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I am a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different person (i.e. a copy) after getting whacked on the head because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no evidence suggesting that is the case.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but many do not.  The argument that you can't prove it hasn't
<br>
happened seems to be weak to me.  We can't prove that aliens aren't living
<br>
among us either, but it's not a conclusive argument.  The argument that
<br>
destroying the original makes the copy become the original seems weak to me
<br>
also.  If the original is allowed to survive, most copy schemes fail as the
<br>
original obviously objects that the copy is not &quot;me&quot;.  Destroying the
<br>
original or preventing the original from objecting does not remove the
<br>
objection, but seems to be a parliamentary trick to prevent the objection
<br>
from ever being voiced.  However, those who voice the objection in advance
<br>
still feel that they have a standing complaint even after they are dead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Living through a session of complete neural cessation also does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the changing of the physical mechanism housing the consciousness.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty obvious that going to sleep and waking up or experiencing a short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period of being clinically dead and then revived is a far cry from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically incinerating a body and every atom and molecule and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructing an identical copy of it, as one scenario involves destruction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some kind, and the other does not.  How the view that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two scenarios
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are indistinguishable can be held by a rational scientifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minded person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know.
</em><br>
<p>Funny you should mention that.  I have been declared legally dead three
<br>
times.  This does not affect my belief that I am me and a copy is not.  I
<br>
also have an identical twin brother, who many might think is close enough to
<br>
be &quot;me&quot;.  However, he and I as well as our spouses would object to this
<br>
claim!  I may feel closer to these questions than most people, but somehow
<br>
there is an internal self-identity of location that tells me I am here and
<br>
everybody else is &quot;out there&quot;.  Unless this location somehow moves into a
<br>
new body, I will always view my potential replacement from the outside and
<br>
claim that I am still in here, and the replacement is still &quot;out there&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To elaborate a little further, there is a principle in science referred to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Occam's Razor,
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I find it disturbing that some of the copy scenarios seem overly
<br>
complicated or rely on nonscientific arguments.  I believe there is a
<br>
semantic problem where we are not expressing ourselves well enough, or that
<br>
proper words don't exist for what we want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 'you are always changing' argument, example from responses to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my post...
</em><br>
<p>Some changes are positive, some changes are negative, and some changes are
<br>
fatal.  Extrapolating that some changes can be made without destroying
<br>
identity, and therefore other changes can be made without destroying
<br>
identity, is a logical fallacy.  It does not prove anything.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Harvey, in response to my comments later says when summing up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The argument finally boils down, in my opinion, to semantics.  Given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of identity that claims the two copies are separate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the two copies are separate.  Given the definition of identity that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims all copies are the same individual, we can prove that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same individual.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders says
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The problem is that we end up in semantics while really trying to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something relevant about selfhood.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds like circular reasoning to me, that is, assuming the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a premise.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that both sides of the argument have used circular reasoning to
<br>
prove their points.  I don't think anyone has articulated their belief
<br>
system well enough without already having a preconceived notion of &quot;me&quot;.  If
<br>
you don't know what &quot;me&quot; is, you can't prove or disprove it.  If you already
<br>
know what &quot;me&quot; is, then your proof will agree with your definition, but will
<br>
fail to satisfy someone else with a different definition.  I think most
<br>
arguments to date have been interpreted by their proponents as proofs, and
<br>
interpreted by their opponents as disproofs.  Each reads the argument with
<br>
their own definitions, and therefore reach their own conclusions.  When
<br>
pointing out the flaw, a dispute over terminology of &quot;me&quot; results.  The
<br>
arguments over the proofs lead back to the original argument.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the simplest explanation that the evidence
<br>
<em>&gt; points to, it is reasonable to assume (and scientific) that you do not die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and get copied while you sleep, and that you are the same person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whacked on the head.  I do not see it as a semantics argument, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing about the definition of what it means to be me.  We are making an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observational claim that if you were to copy my neural pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and recreate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it with a new set of atoms and molecules, that 'person' which is both a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neural pattern and a group of molecules exists independently from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am not aware of its thoughts and hopes and dreams, and it is not aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mine.
</em><br>
<p>This is all objective.  I think you are correct that everyone will agree on
<br>
what the objective results would be.  Now, some would choose to label the
<br>
copy &quot;me&quot;, while others will choose to label the copy &quot;not-me&quot;.  Although we
<br>
agree on all attributes and functionality of this copy, we disagree on its
<br>
labeling as &quot;me&quot; or not.  It is the &quot;me-label&quot; that is semantic.  We don't
<br>
know what to call this copy, but we all can describe it and predict what it
<br>
will be like.  This is the semantic problem to which I refer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I mentioned before, if a copy is made with a passive scanning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are both revived, do we perceive the same thing?
</em><br>
<p>A reasonable argument which I agree proves your point.  However, some will
<br>
argue that they are both &quot;you&quot; and that &quot;you&quot; are now fragmented in two
<br>
bodies with two simultaneous perceptions.  I think this is silly, and
<br>
changes the definitions of our basic words.  Given your definition of self,
<br>
the copy is not you.  Given someone else's different definition of self, the
<br>
copy is you.  The two definitions do not describe the same thing.
<br>
Therefore, the argument is whether an apple is &quot;the fruit&quot; or an orange is
<br>
&quot;the fruit&quot;.  The labels are used by different people to refer to different
<br>
criteria.
<br>
<p>Other people will try to rig up complicated symmetrical rooms or virtual
<br>
reality such that your copy cannot perceive anything different from you.  I
<br>
think this is a trick to prevent us from measuring reality, rather than
<br>
proving the nature of reality itself.  But it is very difficult to argue
<br>
these questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In conclusion, I am really trying to understand what I am missing in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument, if so many people are so sure the point is irrelevant, what am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not realizing?
</em><br>
<p>This is the central element that keeps most of us intrigued with this
<br>
question.  Why can the other side not see such obvious and basic concepts?
<br>
Why can't each side explain what they mean in simple terms that are accepted
<br>
by the opposing side?  Why are there so many intelligent people on both
<br>
sides of the issue, when the issue seems so obvious to everybody?
