<p>Perhaps some linkage is possible between Samantha's ideas and the idea
<br>
of universe as sim. Most of the time I'm pretty much a strict
<br>
materialist but have experienced states where I feel more 'open' to
<br>
(perhaps) the kind of cosmic influences to which Samantha refers. While
<br>
it's possible anomalies may be editted out of our experience I tend to
<br>
doubt this. Perhaps in the universe-as-sim we are more like neural
<br>
networks rather than computer programs such that while it's easy to
<br>
prevent future occurances of an anomaly, it's more difficult to edit out
<br>
past anomalies out of individual human histories. Hence my understanding
<br>
that a) almost everyone has had some sort of unexplainable psychic
<br>
experience, and b) these have failed to be reproduced in laboratory
<br>
settings.
<br>
<p>Perhaps reality becomes more concrete under observation, and more
<br>
plastic under influence of religious/occult memes. We might all agree
<br>
this is true for an individual, but if our universe is co-created (or a
<br>
sim), perhaps it's true for base reality as well. If the latter, then we
<br>
might be able to determine if we are in a sim thru mass efforts at
<br>
anomaly detection. Or perhaps by 'stretching' the limits of the sim (if
<br>
we're in one) by (for example) all of us taking off in groups to
<br>
different directions in space. Or just get everyone to do something
<br>
unexpected tomorrow.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
