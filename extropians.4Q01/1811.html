</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you should read up on Far Eastern religious history
<br>
before you claim that those who practiced religion less or in
<br>
different ways were so strongly oppressed that the meme was
<br>
enforced.  Hinduism and Buddhism in particular, at least in many
<br>
of their forms, do not require fixed adherence to a single dogma
<br>
or even to belief in God or gods and goddesses.   Buddhism is
<br>
even less restrictive as its primary original lines were not
<br>
theistic and certainly did not enforce Buddhist memes.  Another
<br>
small problem is that some of these faiths tend toward celibacy
<br>
of the most faithful and especially the leadership.  So one
<br>
wonders how these strong religion/spirituality memes would
<br>
propagate so well under such conditions. 
<br>
<p>Also, relatively socially coherent religious systems rather than
<br>
many competing superstitions and views are a fairly recent
<br>
phenomenon - more like the last 10,000 years than the last
<br>
100,000 by what evidence we have.
