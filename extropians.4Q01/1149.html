<p>_Escape from Leviathan: Liberty, Welfare and Anarchy Reconciled_ 246 pages
<br>
(Hardcover) Palgrave; ISBN: 0312234163
<br>
<p>Book Description:
<br>
<p>The principal criticism of libertarianism is that it would
<br>
damage human welfare. In response, this book considers an
<br>
extreme libertarian thesis: there is no conceptual or practical
<br>
clash among the most plausible accounts of economic rationality,
<br>
interpersonal liberty, human welfare, and private-property
<br>
anarchy. Eschewing moral advocacy as a distraction, it offers
<br>
a critical-rationalist defense of this objective thesis from
<br>
many criticisms in the literature.
<br>
<p>Reviews:
<br>
<p>'Lester's book develops a sustained and at times fresh and surprising
<br>
argument for its compatibilist conclusions. It constitutes a formidable
<br>
intellectual challenge to the social democratic establishment in Political
<br>
theory.' Professor Antony Flew
<br>
<p>'Lester argues that utility is compatible with liberty, understood in its
<br>
classically 'negative' sense. In the process, he has written a remarkable
<br>
book, informed by a masterly knowledge of economics and filled with careful
<br>
analytical detail. He deals with a vast range of criticisms, and in the
<br>
process undoes a great deal of theoretical mischief on the relations between
<br>
these important concepts, including much by philosophers of major
<br>
reputation. His accounts of instrumental rationality, of property rights, of
<br>
public goods problems, and of restitution for criminal cases, are important
<br>
contributions and will be discussed with interest for long. Few among us
<br>
will fail to benefit from reading it.' - Professor Jan Narveson
<br>
<p>J.C. Lester has written an outstanding book...he tackles the subject with
<br>
the consummate skill of an expert in the field...his critique of democracy
<br>
was a heady, almost intoxicating, refutation...Lester shows considerable
<br>
originality...He is able to use the concepts and intellectual weaponry of
<br>
libertarianism as effectively as the giants of the subject - Rothbard, David
<br>
Friedman and the early Nozick included...rarely has capitalism been
<br>
justified with such philosophical expertise...In a short review article it
<br>
is impossible to do justice to Lester's remarkable book. He manages to say
<br>
new and exciting things about criminal justice...new ways of internalizing
<br>
externalities, and property rights solutions to the 'tragedy of the
<br>
commons'...Lester's arguments are presented with sophistication and are
<br>
informed by an impressive mastery of the secondary literature.' - Norman
<br>
Barry, Professor of Social and Political Theory, University of Buckingham
<br>
<p>'This is a notably ambitious reconstruction of radical libertarian thinking
<br>
from the ground up. Even those, like myself, who are unpersuaded by its
<br>
reformulation of classical liberalism will benefit from reading Lester's
<br>
book.' - Professor John Gray, Professor of European Thought, London School
<br>
of Economics and Political Science, University of London
<br>
<p>'Lester's book develops a sustained and at times fresh and surprising
<br>
argument for its compatibilist conclusions. It constitutes a formidable
<br>
intellectual challenge to the social democratic establishment in Political
<br>
theory.' - Professor Antony Flew, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy,
<br>
University of Reading
