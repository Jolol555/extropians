Randy Smith replied:
<br>
<p>Only when the numbers involved are small, and the benefit is great. By great
<br>
<p>benefit, I mean *real science*, or some *special* skill.  Importing database
<br>
<p>coders to enhance stockholder wallets and CEO bonuses does not qualify.
<br>
<p>#### Define &quot;real science&quot; and &quot;special&quot; skill. So you say stockholders and
<br>
business leaders are not important enough for their political wishes to be
<br>
taken into consideration? I remember my political science teachers in Poland
<br>
unsuccessfully trying to convince me of the same.

Me:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And I like your metaphor of America as a common business property of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all its citizens.
</em><br>
<p>Randy:
<br>
<p>Just remember something--&quot;laziness&quot; of a business owner is a meaningless 
<br>
concept unless you are a *partner* in the business. If you own a welding 
<br>
shop, and you prefer not to work on weekends, I, as a non-partner, have no 
<br>
right to throw you out and take because I see you as lazy.
<br>
<p>### But if you, the owner, are lazy, your business will go bankrupt trying
<br>
to compete with those who want to work on Sundays. This is the invisible
<br>
hand crushing the unfit ones.  This is the reason why America beat Russia -
<br>
you let losers lose instead of coddling them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;----
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;### But now you are saying that the impersonal &quot;corporations&quot; should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;allowed to follow your personal lead and hire cheap immigrants, as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descibed in the preceding paragraph.  Are you saying that the coporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and their mainly American owners and employees should be denied the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights of association that you claim for yourself? They also want to &quot;put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more pieces of green paper in the wallets of the partners&quot;, just like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
Randy:
<br>
<p>Yes, but naturally there are conflicting interests involved in such a large 
<br>
partnership.  And when the partnership is so large, and the money involved 
<br>
is so great, and so much is concentrated in so few hands, I expect to see 
<br>
massive propaganda campaigns waged, just as in any election, etc.
<br>
<p>#### You didn't answer if corporations should be denied the rights I
<br>
mentioned. Obviously corporations will try to defend their rights to hire
<br>
workers according to merit, for the benefit of all their stockholders.
<br>

&gt;##### I understand your position well, but I wouldn't call it impartial -
&gt;you would like to have the benefits (ability to hire a cheaper worker for
&gt;your business)
<p>Randy:
<p>I never said that. You are making up stuff. You are implying that I said 
that I myself want the choice of hiring cheap immigrant labor, but no one 
else can.  Why stop there? I am sure there are many other things you can 
make up.
<p>###  Let me quote you:
<p>If I, Randy Smith, own a business, and I want to hire, I hire the person who
<p>will benefit me, Randy Smith.  And if I am a partner in a business, we, the 
partners, will dicuss candidates, and hire the ones that benefit us, the 
partners, the most.
<p>#### Unless you say that hiring expensive and lazy locals is going to
benefit your business the most, your above statement is a clear endorsement
of the freedom to hire the best and cheapest workers available. In later
staments however, you deny this right to larger corporations.
