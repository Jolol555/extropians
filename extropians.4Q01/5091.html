<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As the closest thing to an expert on landmine warfare on this list (in all

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; this topic know anything about the doctrine, technology, and deployment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; landmines in warfare.  To try to paint the US as a bad guy on the topic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; landmines suggests great ignorance of some fundamental history and facts on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; this subject.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nor do I care to.  Blowing body parts off of civilians for

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amount of &quot;expertise&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...

<em>&gt; Samantha, you do yourself no service by totally ignoring the facts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented by well-informed individuals to continue your emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screeds.  Even those of us who have sympathy for your points of view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find it harder to take you seriously when you evince such a lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic personal and intellectual integrity.  There are a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warmongers in the world, and it is good to have an opposing voice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but if that opposing voice willingly sacrifices its own credibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has done more harm for its cause than good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Granted and I regretted some of the harshness of my stance as
<br>
soon as I hit the &lt;send&gt; button.  However, the issue of
<br>
landmines and the lack of support for cleaning up our (US) mess
<br>
from past actions, is far more than an &quot;emotional screed&quot;.  
<br>
<p>Excuse me, but getting emotional about an issue of human beings
<br>
including large number of children being blown to bits by the
<br>
results of conflicts long past is in my mind a little
<br>
excusable.  It certainly DOES NOT justify impugning my personal
<br>
or intellectual integrity.  You do yourself no good in the call
<br>
for reason by practicing such ill-considered and unjustified
<br>
attacks.  Please take a moment to attend to the beam in your own
<br>
eye.
