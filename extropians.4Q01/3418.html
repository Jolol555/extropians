<em>&gt; Yes, generally enlisted men for such things as rape, murder of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dresden fire bombing. 
</em><br>
<p>He always maintained it was necessary.
<br>
It may well have been, but it was still pretty horrible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The US has a much better record than other nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in prosecuting its own soldiers for war crimes. 
</em><br>
<p>And a currently appalling one internationally for prosecuting it's own
<br>
soldiers or war crimes. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As for area bombing, thats a matter of debate. Some targets are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate for area bombing, others are not, today. Back when there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no *other* sort of bombing, such a standard could not be applied. 
</em><br>
<p>Hang on, I am specifically referring to the practice of considering
<br>
civilian factory workers as war material, and therefore legitimate
<br>
targets. I am not referring to the British use of mass night-time
<br>
concentrations of bombers over military targets, with the accompanying
<br>
poor aim and &quot;collateral damage&quot; I mean the actual doctrine of killing
<br>
german citizens to reduce the german capacity to wage war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Geneva Conventions, military assets are supposed to be located
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinctly apart from civilians and civilian property. Germany and Japan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointedly ignored this rule. They also ignored the rule against using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; POWs as human shields.
</em><br>
<p>See above, though.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Furthermore, I don't regard Hiroshima or Nagasaki to be primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; terrorist acts. By late in the war, both the German and Japanese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; governments had so thoroughly mobilized and armed their societies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; preparation for invasion of their home territories that the only people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; there that could be considered 'non-combatants' under the Geneva
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Conventions were those in POW camps and patients in hospitals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You know, I spent 2 minutes searching on google for &quot;hiroshima end war&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and found a lot of evidence to suggest that this is entirely wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Refer to my quote yesterday from the head of the Joint Chiefs, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatever he was.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Accounts of the event at Hiroshima by people who were schoolchildren at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time include references to school physical education programs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were exclusively geared toward martial arts training with weapons like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spears, how to set up booby traps, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. Britain had a Home Guard, I'm sure the US had the same thing. 
<br>
It is not certain that Japan would have hung on until the bitter,
<br>
post-invasion end.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Under the Geneva Conventions, when a combatant hides behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; non-combatants or in non-combatant facilities, those then become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; combatant targets as well, legally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, well, what about the &quot;highway of death&quot; out of Kuwait? Soldiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fleeing a battle are non-combatants, yet a hell of a lot of people were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; massacred on that road.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soldiers fleeing a battle are not non-combatants, 
</em><br>
<p>Um, I read that they *are* non-combatants, under the Geneva Convention.
<br>
I'm going to have to dig this thing up and read it at some stage, I'm
<br>
relying on journalists, which is a scary concept.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; especially if they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to take their weapons and loot with them. Nine out of ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldiers who die in battle are shot in the back during retreats.
</em><br>
<p>I read that a total of **  4  **  shots were proven to have come from
<br>
that column, which was full of kuwaiti civilians. Where did you get your
<br>
&quot;nine out of ten&quot; figure from? This 4-shot figure came from an article
<br>
on Drugs Czar McCaffery (?) recently.  I'll see if I can dig it up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only conditions under which a soldier is a non-combatant is if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are wounded and drop their weapons, if they surrender and drop their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons, or if they are parachuting from a damaged aircraft.
</em><br>
<p>And if there are civilians dragged along in said flight, tough? They die
<br>
too?
