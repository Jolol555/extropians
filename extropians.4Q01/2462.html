Defending Peacetime
<br>
by Alan Bock
<br>
from <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/bock/b110701.html">http://www.antiwar.com/bock/b110701.html</a>
<br>
<p>You might not think that peace and prosperity would need defending against
<br>
the pervasive sacrifice and death that characterize war and conflict. To
<br>
assume that most people, especially public intellectuals, would prefer peace
<br>
to widespread devastation, however, would be to make a mistake. There are
<br>
certain sectors of American intellectual life - spread sometimes
<br>
surprisingly across what passes for an ideological spectrum - that not only
<br>
find war acceptable but welcome it with something approaching relish.
<br>
<p>Peacetime, apparently, is boring and filled with trivialities. Frank Rich of
<br>
the _New York Times_, on September 15, almost exulted at the change wrought
<br>
by terrorism: &quot;That fat, daydreaming America is gone now, way gone, as spent
<br>
as the tax-rebate checks, as forgotten as the 2000 campaign's debate over
<br>
prescription-drug plans, as bankrupt as our dot-com fantasies of instant
<br>
millions.&quot; Maureen Dowd wrote of the &quot;pampered, narcissistic culture&quot; we
<br>
have now left behind (perhaps along with the post-ironic
<br>
politics-as-soap-opera columns at which she excelled, poor thing).
<br>
<p>War is much more exciting and consequential than mere trying to get ahead in
<br>
life. The news media love it - almost to death and certainly to excess in
<br>
the anthrax scare. I haven't had the opportunity to monitor other parts of
<br>
the country, but the local TV news in Los Angeles doesn't lead with the
<br>
murder du jour, car chase or celebrity scandal these days, it leads with
<br>
war. Some of the stations have even sent reporters to Afghanistan, and most
<br>
of those remaining in Los Angeles clearly relish an opportunity to put their
<br>
reporting skills (which are sometimes considerable despite some contrary
<br>
on-camera evidence) to use on what they can view as a real story rather than
<br>
local fluff.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIFFERENT VIRTUES
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting bit of recent '90s-bashing came from _Weekly
<br>
Standard_ senior editor David Brooks, in an article titled &quot;The Age of
<br>
Conflict,&quot;
<br>
[<a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/424hwkwa">http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/424hwkwa</a>.
<br>
asp] that overall was actually rather interesting and perhaps almost
<br>
evenhanded.  In the wretched 1990s, Brooks avers, &quot;an easy cynicism settled
<br>
across the land, as more people came to believe that national politics
<br>
didn't really matter.  What mattered instead, it seemed, were local affairs,
<br>
community, intimate relations, and the construction of private paradises.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now that we have a war to contend with, presumably we can turn our attention
<br>
to more serious and consequential stuff.  Brooks, along with _Standard_
<br>
editor Bill Kristol, has been plumping for some project - any project - to
<br>
restore a conservatism of &quot;national greatness,&quot; rather than a petty
<br>
conservatism of small government, freedom and close attention to private
<br>
lives, for about a decade now.  Osama bin Laden and his henchmen
<br>
(presumably) have handed the _Standard_ boys a great gift.
<br>
<p>One might hope that Mr. Brooks's analysis is incorrect, but it might not be.
<br>
&quot;The next few years will be defined by conflict,&quot; he writes.
<br>
<p>&quot;And it's possible to speculate about what that means. The institutions that
<br>
fight for us and defend us against disorder - the military, the FBI, the
<br>
CIA - will seem more important now and more admirable.  The fundamental
<br>
arguments won't be over economic or social issues, they will be over how to
<br>
wield power - whether to use American power aggressively or circumspectly.
<br>
We will care a lot more about ends - winning the war - than we will about
<br>
means.  We will debate whether it is necessary to torture prisoners who have
<br>
information about future biological attacks.  We will destroy innocent
<br>
villages by accident, shrug our shoulders, and continue fighting.  In an age
<br>
of conflict, bourgeois virtues like compassion, tolerance, and
<br>
industriousness are valued less than the classical virtues of courage,
<br>
steadfastness, and a ruthless desire for victory.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COLOR ME BOURGEOIS
<br>
<p>Of course, Mr. Brooks's delineation of the difference between &quot;bourgeois&quot;
<br>
and &quot;classical&quot; virtues is a bit arbitrary.  I have nothing against courage,
<br>
of course.  But I do wonder if it is most classically expressed in he
<br>
willingness to kill or be killed at the behest of a political leader who may
<br>
or may not have your best interests at heart - or even know who you are.
<br>
Often it takes as much or more real courage to resist violence or to resist
<br>
those who call others to violence than to participate in violence.
<br>
<p>On balance, however, if you accept the Brooks bifurcation, I guess I'm a
<br>
bourgeois.  I'll opt for compassion, tolerance and industriousness as
<br>
building blocks of a decent society over ruthless desire and perhaps even
<br>
steadfastness (depending on how you define that sometimes elusive concept)
<br>
any day.  These virtues are the path to a society in which innovation,
<br>
production, and the leisure for contemplation essential to allowing a great
<br>
culture to take root and grow have a chance to flourish.  These are the
<br>
virtues that make it possible to provide things people really need and want
<br>
(as expressed by their voluntary choices in the marketplace) in something
<br>
resembling abundance.
<br>
<p>These virtues, in short, are the virtues of a civilized society - the
<br>
virtues of Athens rather than Sparta.  To say so doesn't imply that it might
<br>
not be necessary to defend that society from predators and invaders from
<br>
time to time.  But picking fights and going out in the world to find alleged
<br>
wrongs to right (whether the alleged victims want to be rescued or not) is
<br>
not the same as defending society from attack.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHY DID VIOLENCE COME CALLING?
<br>
<p>Brooks seems pleased that the acts of terrorism have shocked Americans out
<br>
of their selfish torpor. In the Bad Old Nineties Americans expressed a
<br>
distaste for conflict and violence. &quot;But now violence has come calling,&quot;
<br>
Brooks says.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now it is no longer possible to live so comfortably in one's own private
<br>
paradise. Shocked out of the illusion of self-reliance, most of us realize
<br>
that we, as individuals, simply cannot protect ourselves. Private life
<br>
requires public protection. Now it is not possible to ignore foreign affairs
<br>
because foreign affairs have not ignored us. It has become clear that we are
<br>
living in a world in which hundreds of millions of people hate us, and some
<br>
small percentage of them want to destroy us.&quot;
<br>
<p>That brief paragraph contains so many conclusions based on assumptions not
<br>
in evidence that it is difficult to know where to begin. To be sure,
<br>
violence did come calling on the United States, and we have had to come to
<br>
grips with the fact that millions of people seem to hate us simply because
<br>
we are Americans.
<br>
<p>But is this because the country has practiced an excess of self-reliance and
<br>
has turned its back (as a government, at least) on the outside world to the
<br>
point of ignoring it? The record of the 1990s hardly supports such an
<br>
assertion.
<br>
<p>The decade began with the Gulf War, a massive display of American military
<br>
power combined with fairly impressive coalition-building. In the '90s, U.S.
<br>
troops were committed, with varying degrees of seriousness, to conflicts in
<br>
Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo, none of them exactly central to the core
<br>
national interest no matter how one defines it. American diplomats were
<br>
dispatched to conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and elsewhere
<br>
to try to impose an American stamp on local conflicts. NATO, a relic of the
<br>
Cold War, was expanded rather than dismantled, and used for the first time
<br>
to fight an offensive rather than a defensive war, sending chills into the
<br>
Russians.
<br>
<p>That's not exactly ignoring the world until the world comes crashing in on
<br>
us. One might even argue that all this mostly ineffective meddling had
<br>
something to do with so many people hating us. It's undoubtedly not the
<br>
whole reason, but it would be prudent to consider foreign interventionism as
<br>
a contributing factor.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RELYING ON WHOM?
<br>
<p>One wonders whether Brooks is referring to personal or national
<br>
self-reliance, but it is hardly the case that an excess of self-reliance was
<br>
the besetting sin of the 1990 in either sense. On the domestic front the
<br>
welfare state continued to grow apace without any serious move to dismantle
<br>
it in favor of self-reliance. On the international front the Clinton era was
<br>
an era of multilateralism, though not consistently so.
<br>
<p>So was it foolish self-reliance that set the stage for terrorist attacks and
<br>
made us appreciate the virtues of public protection? You could make a better
<br>
case that the attacks represented a massive failure of public protection.
<br>
You could even say that sane Americans should have been shocked out of a
<br>
complacent reliance on the state to protect our interests and resolved to
<br>
regain the American tradition of self-reliance that the passengers on the
<br>
flight that crashed in Pennsylvania utilized (once they had the required
<br>
information) to save any number of innocent lives.
<br>
<p>During the initial stages of any foreign conflict, of course, self-reliance
<br>
and a determination to question our leaders and institutions are hardly
<br>
likely to be conspicuous. American presidents know the American people will
<br>
rally around them and want to believe they are doing the right thing during
<br>
any foreign conflict, even one precipitated by American foolishness. During
<br>
a conflict precipitated by an outright attack on American soil, the first
<br>
response will be to support the president and the government, perhaps even
<br>
to brand those who raise uncomfortable questions as traitors, as some of us
<br>
have discovered.
<br>
<p>A lot more Americans have purchased personal firearms since September 11,
<br>
which I view as an indicator of self-reliance and an acknowledgment that the
<br>
public forces of order cannot protect us at all times and in all
<br>
circumstances so we had best be prepared to do at least something for
<br>
ourselves. That indicator aside, however, it is likely that at least for a
<br>
time the institutions of centralized governance will be treated with more
<br>
respect and given more leeway than is generally healthy in a free society.
<br>
Those of us who deplore such a development may have to bide our time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASPECTS OF WAR
<br>
<p>To his credit, Brooks notes that wartime does tend to encourage conformity
<br>
and homogeneity and to discourage dissent and individuality. There are other
<br>
aspects of wartime culture that sociologist Robert Nisbet has identified -
<br>
an acceleration of certain kinds of change in society, an increase in sexual
<br>
promiscuity as military people are removed from their families for extended
<br>
periods of time, and ambivalent pressures - both pulling-apart and
<br>
pulling-together on family ties and a sense of place. War tends to uproot
<br>
people and undermine a sense of rootedness and groundedness, of being an
<br>
integral part of a certain locale. It tightens some communitarian ties and
<br>
frays others.
<br>
<p>One wonders if certain traditional conservatives who are whooping it up for
<br>
war have fully considered these aspects of wartime culture.
<br>
<p>To be sure, war for many - especially young males - is the ultimate
<br>
adventure, and for many people (those who survive) it remains a highlight of
<br>
their lives, a time of intense effort, commitment and camaraderie beside
<br>
which civilian life and the 9-to-5 routine pales. (Note how the Greatest
<br>
Generation never tires of reliving the Good War, and the war envy generated
<br>
among boomers.) Wartime can also be conducive to focused efforts to complete
<br>
certain kinds of projects that may represent genuine technological advances,
<br>
like the development of radar or the atomic bomb, on an accelerated basis.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAKING A CASE FOR PEACE
<br>
<p>It is important for those who yearn for peace to understand and acknowledge
<br>
that war has its attractions for many (though I would take certain people
<br>
more seriously if the editors of the Weekly Standard, for example, were
<br>
volunteering to lead an irregular brigade to go get Osama bin Laden
<br>
themselves rather than exulting in the opportunity other mothers' sons will
<br>
create to pursue an agenda of National Greatness).
<br>
<p>It may or may not be true that war and conflict are built into the human
<br>
genome and that the dream of a world without war is at odds with reality and
<br>
human nature. But there are decidedly aspects of war that appeal to some
<br>
aspects of human nature that most people seem to have in abundance.
<br>
<p>It is incumbent on us, then, to remind people continually and persistently
<br>
that even if war is sometimes necessary, even if war has its attractions,
<br>
that peace is also essential to human well being. Although some great
<br>
artistic works have been created in response to war, no great culture,
<br>
whether artistic, musical or literary, has ever been built during wartime.
<br>
<p>Creating a culture - an atmosphere in which contemplation can lead to
<br>
innovation, experiment and thinking seriously about what constitutes beauty
<br>
(rather than the occasional individual works of genius) - cannot be done
<br>
during the chaos of war. The great eras of cultural ferment and progress
<br>
have been eras of relative peace, when goods, tourists and cultural
<br>
innovators crossed borders rather than armies.
<br>
<p>It is possible to create the kind of wealth that has a chance to lift a
<br>
substantial number of people out of poverty - the most common lot of most
<br>
human beings through most of history - only in times of relative peace and
<br>
security (and, I would argue, respect for commerce and those who undertake
<br>
it). If we want to improve the lot of those who have not yet achieved a
<br>
semblance of economic self-sufficiency we would do well to pray and work for
<br>
peace as the minimum requirement. In wars, such people's suffering tends to
<br>
be multiplied, or ended by a swift death.
<br>
<p>And while most human beings display a certain attraction for war and the
<br>
martial virtues and vices, human beings are complex creatures. We may love
<br>
adventure, but we also value the quiet times, the safe times, the
<br>
contemplative times, to spend with our families, to go fishing, to watch the
<br>
World Series, to hike, to sit by the side of a lake, to make music with
<br>
friends, to read for enrichment or pleasure, to simply sit and think or let
<br>
the mind go blank. You can find moments for such pleasures during wartime,
<br>
but they are often fleeting and transient. The side of us that values quiet
<br>
pleasures must hope and work for peace.
<br>
<p>This current war on terrorism is an ideal conflict for political leaders in
<br>
that it encourages submission and acquiescence to expanded government power
<br>
but has no definable end. I fear, therefore, that it will last a long time.
<br>
It behooves us to use that time not only to criticize and question the war,
<br>
but to remind our fellows that peace has its virtues and its pleasures also.
<br>
We'll have ample time to develop and test our arguments.
