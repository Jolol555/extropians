Create your own libertarian society now... in the Dark Age of Camelot :-)

<p>(I was writing this post when eikeon pointed out [1] so the timing is
<br>
interesting.)
<br>
<p>I am becoming increasingly convinced that a fascinating thesis topic for
<br>
some political science grad student would be the development of political
<br>
and legal systems in massively multi-player online role playing games.
<br>
<p>I am guildmaster of one of the dominant guilds in Dark Age of Camelot [2].
<br>
<p>When I started playing DAoC (the day it came out) I was in a different guild
<br>
whose dictatorial leader was a great war-time leader but a poor peace-time
<br>
leader. Largely as a result, that guild collapsed and, in its place, many of
<br>
the original guild members formed a new guild designed to be a
<br>
representative democracy. It was in this guild that I was elected leader.
<br>
<p>Over time, as people started complaining about the actions of others, we
<br>
found the need to develop rules but that immediately led to questions of
<br>
separation of legislature from judiciary, etc. Also some people favoured
<br>
more specific rules (thus placing the burden on legislation) and others more
<br>
general rules (thus placing the burden on the judiciary and emphasizing
<br>
precedence over statute).
<br>
<p>One of the elected representatives happens to be my in-game wife [3,4]
<br>
(first role-played marriage in the game -- another fascinating topic,
<br>
perhaps for another time). This led to accusations that I was just a puppet
<br>
and that my &quot;wife&quot; really controlled two votes.
<br>
<p>An interested thing has started to happen, though. People are now starting
<br>
to call for a return to a dictatorship. They no longer want a council of
<br>
elected representatives. They are actually asking me to assume dictatorial
<br>
control. This has taken me by surprise.
<br>
<p>I find the whole thing fascinating and think the subject area definitely
<br>
worthy of a more detailed study.
