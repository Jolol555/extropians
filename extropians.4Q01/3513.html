<p>People Power: Capturing The Body's Energy For Work On and Off Earth

<br>
<p>Covert military operations and space shuttle missions are both burdened by
<br>
the fact that they rely on an inefficient, energy-wasting machine: the human
<br>
body. Considering one of the biggest logistical problems planners face is
<br>
getting power to equipment in remote places like Afghanistan or the moon,
<br>
researchers are devoting their efforts to cut some of those losses through
<br>
&quot;energy harvesting&quot; from the human body.
<br>
<p><p>If that gives you creepy images of people wired up as batteries a la &quot;The
<br>
Matrix,&quot; stop fretting. What NASA and the Pentagon want to do is scoop up
<br>
electrons from what bodies in normal activity produce: heat, motion, flexing
<br>
and stretching, compression, urine, and body heat. This is quite different
<br>
from other human-powered schemes that take extra exertion, like spring or
<br>
dynamo flashlights and radios that are wound-up by a special handle,
<br>
flashlights that are squeezed by the user to generate charge, or flywheels
<br>
that store energy from a cord that is pulled.
<br>
<p>According to the Center for Space Power and Advanced Electronics, a NASA
<br>
commercial center in Alabama, the human body is on average 15% fat, capable
<br>
of producing 11,000 watt hours. When the average Joe eats his daily bread,
<br>
he takes in 3,300 watt hours. The charge rate is about 7kW if the waiter
<br>
starts pushing you out the door after a half hour lunch, according to the
<br>
Center. &quot;Clearly the amount of energy consumed by an individual is
<br>
sufficient to provide power for electronic devices if a suitable method can
<br>
be found to convert a small fraction of that energy to electricity,&quot; the
<br>
Center concludes in a report on the subject.
<br>
<p>Broken into usable terms, waiting to be harvested are 81 watts from a
<br>
sleeping person, 128 from a soldier standing at ease, 163 from a walking
<br>
person, 407 from a briskly walking person, 1,048 from a long-distance
<br>
runner, and 1,630 from a sprinter, according to the center. But of course
<br>
there's not 100% capture. Body heat, for example, can only be converted with
<br>
3% efficiency with current thermoelectric materials.
<br>
<p>Advances in nanotechnology and materials science are causing energy needs to
<br>
drop at the same time production and transfer of it is increasing. The
<br>
military applications are humble still, though, aimed at small gear like
<br>
personal battery chargers, medical sensors, displays, gun sights, and range
<br>
finders. Boots that turn the compression of a compound into voltage have
<br>
already powered a radio, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects
<br>
Agency. NASA is hoping to feed a range of body monitors, electronics and
<br>
mission-specific devices. In the commercial sphere, companies are racing to
<br>
power simple things like watches for now, with an eye to scaling up to
<br>
handheld PDAs in the future.
<br>
<p>Some of the most promising mechanisms for passively converting human body
<br>
functions into electricity are:
<br>
<p>Piezoelectric devices: Piezoelectric substances, like some ceramics, also
<br>
generate electrical energy from mechanical strain but without the need for
<br>
voltage to be applied. This well-understood material is the core of &quot;heel
<br>
strike&quot; devices that generate electricity from walking. &quot;Generating 1-2
<br>
watts per shoe is not out of the question.  A major issue that remains is
<br>
the durability of these devices,&quot; Dr. Robert J. Nowak, program manager for
<br>
energy harvesting at Darpa, wrote to SPACE.com. Great for soldiers, bad for
<br>
astronauts: &quot;giant steps are what you take, walking on the moon.&quot;
<br>
<p>Urine-based fuel cell: Yes, you can turn pee into power and not just by
<br>
turning a turbine after a few beers. First subject urea to enzymatic
<br>
hydrolysis to make carbon dioxide and ammonia, and then oxidize the ammonia
<br>
to nitrogen and water. But the center notes that &quot;one problem with the
<br>
system is the need for alkaline conditions that may require transport of
<br>
sodium hydroxide, a hazardous compound. Also, to achieve power generation in
<br>
the range of 0.5 - 1W, a system to concentrate the breakdown products of
<br>
urea, such as reverse osmosis, will be necessary.&quot; But for astronauts and
<br>
soldiers on the run, &quot;one attractive feature of this fuel cell concept is
<br>
the production of water as a by-product of the system.&quot;
<br>
<p>Inertial energy scavenging: You can own a piece of this technology already -
<br>
some Seiko watches are powered by a weight that swings as you move, driving
<br>
a tiny generator. No one expects to generate much electricity from these
<br>
systems, but deployed in each element needing electricity they could do the
<br>
trick in concert. Also, while gravity is absent in space, inertia is not.
<br>
<p>Electromagnetic generator: Large muscular groups (especially legs) can
<br>
generate electricity by simple motions against gravity and small direct
<br>
current permanent magnet motors. But the center cautions, &quot;there is little
<br>
or no efforts within the scientific community to design efficient small
<br>
generators of the type needed for harvesting of human energy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thermoelectric materials: These materials convert body heat into electricity
<br>
by using combinations of materials (metals or today, new ceramics) that are
<br>
poor thermal conductors and good electrical conductors. When two of them at
<br>
different temperatures come into contact, electrons migrate, charging a
<br>
battery or creating usable current through something called the Seebeck
<br>
Effect. The trouble is that you need great temperature differences to get
<br>
significant energy, and &quot;on Earth most places are pretty close to body
<br>
temperature,&quot; notes Dr. Henry Brandhurst, director of the center. And what
<br>
about in the cold depths of space? For the inner solar system at least,
<br>
photovoltaic panels seem like a better bet, he says.
<br>
<p>But that skepticism hasn't slowed down efforts at NASA to improve the
<br>
technology, and one company is already pushing it as an off-the-shelf
<br>
product. Applied Digital Solutions is unveiling &quot;Thermo Life.&quot; The company
<br>
is &quot;working closely with a watch manufacturer,&quot; says Keith Bolton, the chief
<br>
technology officer. Already the technology has proven itself capable of
<br>
keeping analog watches ticking, he reports.
<br>
<p>And Dr. Rama Venkatasubramanian of the Research Triangle Institute reported
<br>
in Nature this month a breakthrough in new materials that could double or
<br>
triple the output of thermoelectric generators.
<br>
<p>Electrostrictive polymers: These materials create charge when stretched
<br>
after voltage is induced through them. No prototype has been made, and there
<br>
are concerns about how quickly this material might wear out. But it does
<br>
dovetail nicely with NASA's conception of the spacesuit of the future, which
<br>
will be skin tight to maintain mechanical pressure on blood systems in place
<br>
of the ambient Earth air pressure replicated in &quot;puffy&quot; suits today.
<br>
<p>Electrostatic force arrays: (Also called Integrated Force Arrays) A cousin
<br>
of electrostrictive polymers, this is a new technology. It's expensive and
<br>
untested in power generating applications, or for simple durability.
