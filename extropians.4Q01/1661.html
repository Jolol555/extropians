<p>They are, they have, and there are a few thousand less of us. It
<br>
didn't even take much military strength to do it. Which is the point
<br>
I'm making. Openness is a good strategy only if you're surrounded by
<br>
other open societies... but then closedness also becomes a good
<br>
strategy b/c your neighbors will let you infiltrate and cheat them in
<br>
all sorts of ways.
<br>
<p>I can hear experienced PDers yelling &quot;tit-for-tat, dammit!&quot;. Okay,
<br>
that makes a game stabler, but still not perfect. Now there are three
<br>
types of players: cooperators (open societies), defectors (closed
<br>
societies), and reciprocators (tit-for-tat). Globally, cooperators are
<br>
the most efficient-- they don't waste time figuring out who to
<br>
cooperate with and who to defect on. They just cooperate with
<br>
everyone. Defectors can't parasitize cooperators with impunity
<br>
anymore, because lurking among them are reciprocators who will defect
<br>
on defectors and cooperate with cooperators. There is trouble in
<br>
(near) paradise, though. Because cooperators are more efficient than
<br>
reciprocators, they start to displace them. With reciprocators
<br>
declining, there are fewer who would keep the defectors in
<br>
check. We're back at the first scenario until the reciprocator
<br>
population rebounds (while the cooperators are driven to near
<br>
extinction). In effect, the defectors parasitize of cooperators and
<br>
cooperators to a lesser extent parasitize off reciprocators because
<br>
they use them for defense yet give safe harbor to everyone's mutual
<br>
adversaries, the defectors.
<br>
<p>On a tangent, perhaps herein lies the resentment hawks feel toward
<br>
pacifists-- pacifists survive because society is protected by hawks,
<br>
but they are indiscriminately friendly toward everyone, including
<br>
those the hawks are against.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the next iteration of this puzzle is what would happen if
<br>
there were reciprocators who only cooperated with other reciprocators
<br>
and defected on cooperators and defectors both? Or perhaps
<br>
reciprocators capable of sensing whether they're in a predominantly
<br>
cooperative or defective environment?
