<em>&gt; &gt; Seriously, we our freedom, wealth, time and even lives on the

<em>&gt; &gt; line does it really matter all that much whether we consider a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kamikaze terrorist to be cowardly or not?  I certainly don't see

<em>&gt; &gt; any point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in wasting one more line of text on the subject.  As alwasy, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humble opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You spoke eloquently in another post of the diverse human cultures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how precious they are and how much we will benefit from them (and I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope and want to live such a future).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But here (and in the other thread about justice, islam etc.) I felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you show little interest in understanding the people who made 9/11,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the cultural aspect of it. More than that : you explicitly reject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such interest (&quot;I certainly don't see any point in wasting one more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line of text...&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You have utterly missed what I was attempting to say. 
<br>
Tremendously dirty deeds have been done by the US in the world. 
<br>
In many ways we have set ourselves up.  Now that we ourselves
<br>
have been hit back we are ready to condemn and misunderstand any
<br>
who are against us and many voices call for blowing them off the
<br>
map.  We sit and argue about who was brave and who was cowardly
<br>
when our world and lives and theirs are at stake as well as our
<br>
future.  This judging of the courage or cowardice of the actual
<br>
attackers strikes me as very tremendously beside the point and
<br>
fruitless.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, here is a first point : how can you predict them without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding them ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I can predict that many hate the US for some of its past and
<br>
future actions (not especially for our goodness as some would
<br>
like to believe).  I can predict more of them will take
<br>
increasingly desperate and horrific action as we press this
<br>
&quot;war&quot; more deeply on their homelands.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We heard &quot;cowardice&quot; (I was surprised, too), and we heard &quot;madness&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we heard &quot;evil&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my view, all three are false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you here.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What is true is that they caused a DAMAGE to us (so it is &quot;not good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for us&quot;, that's for sure), and we don't want to let them cause such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it's a matter of OUR INTEREST, not of them being &quot;evil&quot;. In their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, in fact, they are like David with Goliath. They are unarmed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominated, victim of injustice, ruled by the evil miscreant US-Israeli
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces, but they are proud, brave, pious, and they act heroically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (they already defeated the Soviets !)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Again, I agree.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You would call evil someone pervert who hurts for the sake of hurting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example, just because they enjoy to cause suffering. This is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is this important ? For two reasons :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) First, as I said, to predict them. But not only to predict them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the sense of designy security tricks in the airplanes. Also, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    predict how such violent movements will be generated from existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    socio-cultural conditions. That's why I was trying to tell you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    about islam in the other thread -- maybe living in a place where we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    have 10 % muslims discourages me taking the &quot;black-bok&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;mad-evil&quot;, &quot;coward-or-brave-what-do-we-care&quot; approach on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    violent islamists -- but you answered by general &quot;argument&quot; to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    any mention of islam irrelevant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That misses my points.  But I do not believe Islam is itself as
<br>
central as oppression, injustice and victims lashing out against
<br>
who they see as the oppressor any way that they can.  Islam, or
<br>
rather the more militant edge of it, is relevant but I don't
<br>
believe it is the most central for understanding the story.  It
<br>
is easier for many to do amateur &quot;analysis&quot; of Islam and blame
<br>
Islam than come to grips
<br>
with guilt and culpability on our as well as &quot;their&quot; side.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 2) SEcond, because if one's principles are in such a mess that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    must discard reality to be able to act without strong moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    dissonance, then proper action will be very difficult at some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    point. One should get a clear picture of things, what is an ennemy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    and interest, good, evil, damage, justice, these sort of things. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    this is not really about ben Laden. It is about extropian clarity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of mind, principles usable in making choices, not carried like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    baggage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Ben Laden is not mad, not evil, not coward (I don't know him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personnally, but at least it doesn't appear to be). But he is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ENNEMY (read his &quot;Declaration of war against the Americans&quot; in case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have any doubt). Do you need to morally diminish your ennemy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledge him as such ? Of course not !
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Will we make him and others like him less an enemy by bombing
<br>
the hell out of large sections of the Mid East that we have
<br>
already been screwing with in often horrendous ways for
<br>
decades?  Very doubtful.  Will it help our reaching Singularity
<br>
to engage in such hypocritical posturings as &quot;Infinite
<br>
Justice&quot;.  Hell no.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You may object that this way of thinking tends to polarize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation, by accepting that &quot;good&quot; guys can be our ennemies, and be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fullfilling prophecy avoiding that we build a harmonious world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together, with all the good guys, by explaining them that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong to act as they do, and that by just adapting a little their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour, we can consider them as really good guy and not &quot;very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil-mad&quot; good guy. But that which you may overlook, is that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't give a damn of your &quot;harmony&quot; and your &quot;sense of justice&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just degenerated christian-atheist nonsense. For them, justice is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree at all and see some point in being clear
<br>
certainly. But I still think whether we judge the terrorist as
<br>
cowards or courageous is a side-show to the main questions and
<br>
issues.  We are hypocrites to hate these terrorist when our CIA
<br>
has done much worse in many countries, toppled and created
<br>
entire regimes, engaged in torture, terrorizing civilian
<br>
populations and so on.  Any &quot;solution&quot; that does not admit our
<br>
own dirty deeds and work toward stopping our own real terrorism
<br>
is a very dangerous cover-up and scapegoating.  Was what was
<br>
done to the WTC and Pentagon wrong?  Of course.  But was it also
<br>
a seriously aggreivated wrong from our own past actions?   I
<br>
think the answer again has to be affirmative.
