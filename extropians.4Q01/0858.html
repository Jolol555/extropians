<em>&gt;&gt; This isn't quite right.  Adding noise increases the noise floor

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; distortion is a cheap solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your comments are quite right when addressing the ability of the human brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to perceive the distortions.  However, I was discussing a computer's ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to statistically analyze the low-order bits that are imperceptible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Human brains will indeed ignore additional noise because it tends to mask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this out.  The more noise, the closer it falls to a predictable curve, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the easier it is to detect and ignore.  The human brain does this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically, and computers can be programmed to do this as well.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional noise becomes filtered out by the human brain exactly because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes easier to detect and isolate.
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, I'm having difficulty fitting the &quot;adding noise makes it easier to
<br>
eliminate noise&quot; concept into the algorithm spaces that I am familiar with
<br>
that deal with these very things.  There are algorithms like that, but you
<br>
can't use them in the digital domain (at least not like you are discussing)
<br>
and they don't add any information to the source signal.  Some links and
<br>
references would be helpful, because what you are suggesting seems contrary
<br>
to most of the &quot;best practices&quot; and theory that I am familiar with but you
<br>
haven't really given me enough information to say one way or the other.  It
<br>
sounds like you are suggesting some type of digital domain super-sampling
<br>
technique, which is puzzling because I don't see how it provides what you
<br>
are claiming.
<br>
<p>Accurate noise reduction algorithms don't use statistical methods in any
<br>
meaningful sense.  The very best digital noise reduction algorithms don't
<br>
add any noise at all and are very adaptive -- they don't require any real
<br>
history.  There are some super-sampling techniques that inject noise to
<br>
lower the effective noise floor of the signal, but these only apply to the
<br>
analog-to-digital conversion process and are really a substitute for using
<br>
higher resolution converters (not much of a factor these days).  Other than
<br>
dithering, which masks quantization distortion with noise, I can't think of
<br>
a purely digital algorithm that reduces noise by adding noise.  Adding noise
<br>
certainly wouldn't make good noise reduction algorithms work any better.
