In personal death, I suspect we fear loss of control, however that is 
<br>
embedded into the nervous system that generates our &quot;identity.&quot;  I am 
<br>
guessing, that in cloning, there are some who fear a loss of 'personal 
<br>
meaning; or as philosopher John Leslie termed it &quot;value death.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Larry Niven once has a story (All the Myriad Ways) set in an America which 
<br>
had survived a nuclear war, over Cuba in 1962. The protagonist in the story 
<br>
was a Los Angeles police detective, who was assigned to find out why there 
<br>
was suddenly a rash of murders and suicides in the city? One later learned 
<br>
that the scientists of that America had developed a means of crossing 
<br>
worldlines, largely in the pursuit of new technologies. The Punchline was the 
<br>
knowledge that had come down to the average public that there were some xerox 
<br>
copies of themselves, doing other things, making other choices, made their 
<br>
own place in this world, this universe; meaningless. 
<br>
<p>Similarly, clones and xeroxes of yourself, may act as way to diminish one's 
<br>
self esteem. On the other hand, a bit of narcissism, or a lot of jolly, good, 
<br>
humor, might make existence more bearable for all concerned. A 100 man Lee 
<br>
Crocker party might be a bit of fun, after-all. Though having sequential Lee 
<br>
Crockers might make a better choice, in the sense that the deceased Lee would 
<br>
know that the universe would simply get another Lee, to carry on his writing, 
<br>
will, and grief, would certainly not be a primary feature of life, anymore.
<br>
<p>Lee Daniel Crocker stated:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I don't think there's anyone here who will rationally argue
<br>
with the contention that if I underwent a non-destructive
<br>
atom-by-atom copy process, two 100-kg lumps of matter would wake
<br>
up with the memeories I presently call &quot;mine&quot;, as well as the
<br>
sensations, perceptions, values, desires, and intentions I call
<br>
mine.  It doesn't matter to me which one I call &quot;me&quot;, what
<br>
matters is what actual consequences will this action have on
<br>
the world, are they likely to happen in the future, and which
<br>
of them are good and bad?
<br>
<p>What it is that we want?  What is it that we fear?&gt;&gt;
