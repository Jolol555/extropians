&lt;&lt;Even for ants, it can be shown that the colony will be most efficient in
<br>
finding food if individual ants do not merely follow the paths laid down by
<br>
their fellow ants, but regularly deviate and create a path of their own. If
<br>
people understandably dislike the analogy between human societies and insect
<br>
societies, it is not so much because insect societies are organized in an
<br>
intrinsically more totalitarian or collectivistic manner, but because insects
<br>
are simply very dumb, characterless creatures compared to individual humans.

<br>
<p>Why cities behave like ant colonies
<br>
BY ANJANA AHUJA
<br>
<p>A new book sets out a radical theory about urban development
<br>
Nobody designs truly great cities. They just spring up. As if by magic, they
<br>
develop distinct districts that endure from century to century. Think of the
<br>
silk quarter in Florence, or Savile Row in London. A city seems to pulsate
<br>
with
<br>
its own rhythm, as if it is a living, breathing organism.
<br>
<p>Steven Johnson would argue that, in some senses, it is. He would say that the
<br>
superorganism of the city mirrors the superorganism of the ant colony, in
<br>
which
<br>
a collection of individually stupid insects somehow becomes a mesmerising,
<br>
organised whole. Both are examples of emergence, a phenomenon where the whole
<br>
is much greater than the sum of its parts. Another commonly touted example of
<br>
emergence is consciousness, which appears to arise spontaneously from the fact
<br>
that billions of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain are firing off signals to
<br>
each other.
<br>
<p>In a new book, called Emergence, Johnson, an American author best known for
<br>
arguing that computer graphics are as culturally important as books or films,
<br>
aims to coax the topic out of science laboratories and into the mainstream.

<p>An individual ant, like an individual neuron, is just about as dumb as can be.
<br>
Connect enough of them together properly, though, and you get spontaneous
<br>
intelligence. Web pundit Steven Johnson explains what we know about this
<br>
phenomenon with a rare lucidity in Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants,
<br>
Brains, Cities, and Software. Starting with the weird behavior of the
<br>
semi-colonial organisms we call slime molds, Johnson details the development
<br>
of
<br>
increasingly complex and familiar behavior among simple components: cells,
<br>
insects, and software developers all find their place in greater schemes.
<br>
<p>Most game players, alas, live on something close to day-trader time, at least
<br>
when they're in the middle of a game--thinking more about their next move than
<br>
their next meal, and usually blissfully oblivious to the ten- or twenty-year
<br>
trajectory of software development. No one wants to play with a toy that's
<br>
going to be fun after a few decades of tinkering--the toys have to be engaging
<br>
now, or kids will find other toys.
<br>
Johnson has a knack for explaining complicated and counterintuitive ideas
<br>
cleverly without stealing the scene. Though we're far from fully understanding
<br>
how complex behavior manifests from simple units and rules, our awareness that
<br>
such emergence is possible is guiding research across disciplines. Readers
<br>
unfamiliar with the sciences of complexity will find Emergence an excellent
<br>
starting point, while those who were chaotic before it was cool will
<br>
appreciate
<br>
its updates and wider scope. --Rob Lightner
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Publishers Weekly
</em><br>
To have the highly touted editor of a highly touted Web culture organ writing
<br>
about the innate smartness of interconnectivity seems like a hip, winning
<br>
combination unless that journal becomes the latest dot-com casualty. Feed, of
<br>
which Johnson was cofounder and editor-in-chief, recently announced it was
<br>
shuttering its windows, which should make for a less exuberant launch for his
<br>
second bricks-and-mortar title, following 1997's Interface Culture. Yet the
<br>
book's premise and execution make it compelling, even without the backstory.
<br>
In
<br>
a paradigmatic example here, ants, without leaders or explicit laws, organize
<br>
themselves into highly complex colonies that adapt to the environment as a
<br>
single entity, altering size and behavior to suit conditions exhibiting a
<br>
weird
<br>
collective intelligence, or what has come to be called emergence. In the first
<br>
two parts of the book, Johnson ranges over historical examples of such smart
<br>
interconnectivity, from the silk trade in medieval Florence to the birth of
<br>
the
<br>
software industry and to computer programs that produce their own software
<br>
offspring, or passively map the Web by &quot;watching&quot; a user pool. Johnson's tone
<br>
is light and friendly, and he has a journalistic gift for wrapping up complex
<br>
ideas with a deft line: &quot;you don't want one of the neurons in your brain to
<br>
suddenly become sentient.&quot; In the third section, which bears whiffs of '90s
<br>
exuberance, Johnson weighs the impact of Web sites like Napster, eBay and
<br>
Slashdot, predicting the creation of a brave, new media world in which
<br>
self-organizing clusters of shared interests structure the entertainment
<br>
industry. The wide scope of the book may leave some readers wanting greater
<br>
detail, but it does an excellent job of putting the Web into historical and
<br>
biological context, with no dot.com diminishment. (Sept. 19) Forecast: All
<br>
press is good press, so the failure of Feed at least makes a compelling hook
<br>
for reviews, which should be extensive. A memoir of the author's Feed years
<br>
can't be far behind, but in the meantime this should sell solidly, with a
<br>
possible breakout if Johnson's media friends get behind it fully.

Johnson makes sense of the cutting-edge theory of emergence, exploring the
<br>
ways
<br>
intelligent systems are built from small, unintelligent elements without
<br>
control from above. Johnson is a journalist for an online magazine; emergence
<br>
is being touted as the coming paradigm for the Internet. Johnson discerns
<br>
emergent qualities on the Internet by using analogies from the biological
<br>
world, so it is with the world of slime molds and ant colonies that Johnson
<br>
repairs to report on people who have teased out rules of emergence.
<br>
Entomologist Deborah Gordon tells him about the iterative acts of ants that
<br>
produce the meta-behavior of colonies in Arizona (a reprise for readers of her
<br>
Ants at Work, 1999). Cities also exhibit emergence, with Johnson reminding us
<br>
of what Engels wrote about Manchester and Jane Jacobs about New York in The
<br>
Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961). From these and other examples,
<br>
such as the popular computer game SimCity, the Web site eBay, or a
<br>
cyber-community called slashdot.com, Johnson generalizes five rules of
<br>
&quot;bottom-up&quot; behavior in self-organizing systems. A lively snapshot of current
<br>
trends. Gilbert Taylor

<br>
&quot;Emergence is thoughtful and lucid and charming and staggeringly smart...a
<br>
rare, bona fide glimpse of the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>Book Description
<br>
This book is about the mystery of why the whole is sometimes smarter than the
<br>
sum of its parts.
<br>
Emergence is what happens when an interconnected system of relatively simple
<br>
elements self-organizes to form more intelligent, more adaptive higher-level
<br>
behavior. It's a bottom-up model; rather than being engineered by a general or
<br>
a master planner, emergence begins at the ground level. Systems that at first
<br>
glance seem vastly different -- ant colonies, human brains, cities, immune
<br>
systems -- all turn out to follow the rules of emergence. In each of these
<br>
systems, agents residing on one scale start producing behavior that lies a
<br>
scale above them: ants create colonies, urbanites create neighborhoods.
<br>
<p>In the tradition of Being Digital and The Tipping Point, Steven Johnson,
<br>
acclaimed as a &quot;cultural critic with a poet's heart&quot; (The Village Voice),
<br>
takes
<br>
readers on an eye-opening intellectual journey from the discovery of emergence
<br>
to its applications. He introduces us to our everyday surroundings, offering
<br>
suprising examples of feedback, self-organization, and adaptive learning. How
<br>
does a lively neighborhood evolve out of a disconnected association of
<br>
shopkeepers, bartenders, and real estate developers? How does a media event
<br>
take on a life of its own? How will new software programs create an
<br>
intelligent
<br>
World Wide Web?
<br>
<p>Drawing upon evolutionary theory, urban studies, neuroscience, and computer
<br>
games, Emergence is a guidebook to one of the key components of
<br>
twenty-first-century culture. Until recently, Johnson explains, the disparate
<br>
philosophers of emergence have worked to interpret the world. But today they
<br>
are starting to change it. This book is the riveting story of that change and
<br>
what it means for the future. If you've searched for information on the Web,
<br>
played a recent video game, or accepted a collect call using voice recognition
<br>
software, you've already encountered the new world of artificial emergence.
<br>
Provocative, engaging, and sophisticated, Emergence puts you on the front
<br>
lines
<br>
of a sweeping revolution in science and thought.
