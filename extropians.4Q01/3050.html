Title

&nbsp;&nbsp;Lycopene synergistically inhibits LDL oxidation in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;combination with vitamin E, glabridin, rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, or

&nbsp;&nbsp;garlic.

Abstract
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Several lines of evidence suggest that oxidatively modified low-density
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lipoprotein (LDL) is atherogenic, and that atherosclerosis can be attenuated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by natural antioxidants, which inhibit LDL oxidation. This
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;study was conducted to determine the effect of tomato
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lycopene alone, or in combination with other natural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;antioxidants, on LDL oxidation. LDL (100 microg of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;protein/ml) was incubated with increasing concentrations of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lycopene or of tomato oleoresin (lipid extract of tomatoes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;containing 6% lycopene, 0.1% beta-carotene, 1% vitamin E,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and polyphenols), after which it was oxidized by the addition of 5
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;micromol/liter of CuSO4. Tomato oleoresin exhibited superior capacity to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inhibit LDL oxidation in comparison to pure lycopene, by up
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to five-fold [97% vs. 22% inhibition of thiobarbituric acid reactive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;substances (TBARS) formation, and 93% vs. 27% inhibition of lipid peroxides
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;formation, respectively]. Because tomato oleoresin also contains, in addition
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to lycopene, vitamin E, flavonoids, and phenolics, a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;possible cooperative interaction between lycopene and such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;natural antioxidants was studied. A combination of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lycopene (5 micromol/liter) with vitamin E
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(alpha-tocopherol) in the concentration range of 1-10 micromol/liter resulted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in an inhibition of copper ion-induced LDL oxidation that was significantly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;greater than the expected additive individual inhibitions. The synergistic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;antioxidative effect of lycopene with vitamin E was not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;shared by gamma-to-cotrienol. The polyphenols glabridin (derived from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;licorice), rosmarinic acid or carnosic acid (derived from rosemary), as well
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as garlic (which contains a mixture of natural antioxidants)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inhibited LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner. When
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;lycopene (5 micromol/liter) was added to LDL in combination
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with glabridin, rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, or garlic, synergistic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;antioxidative effects were obtained against LDL oxidation induced either by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;copper ions or by the radical generator AAPH. Similar interactive effects
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;seen with lycopene were also observed with beta-carotene,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;but, however, to a lesser extent of synergism. Because natural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;antioxidants exist in nature in combination, the in vivo
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;relevance of lycopene in combination with other natural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;antioxidants was studied. Four healthy subjects were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;administered a fatty meal containing 30 mg of lycopene in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the form of tomato oleoresin. The lycopene concentration in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;postprandial plasma was elevated by 70% in comparison to plasma obtained
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;before meal consumption. Postprandial LDL isolated 5 hr after meal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;consumption exhibited a significant (p &lt; 0.01) reduced susceptibility to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oxidation by 21%. We conclude that lycopene acts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;synergistically, as an effective antioxidant against LDL oxidation, with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;several natural antioxidants such as vitamin E, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flavonoid glabridin, the phenolics rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;garlic. These observations suggest a superior antiatherogenic characteristic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to a combination of different natural antioxidants over that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of an individual one.
