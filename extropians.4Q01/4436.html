<p>Yes.

<p><em>    &gt;We are acting in an insane  manner.
</em><br>
<p>No. I do agree with one thing Bin Laden said on that infamous video tape,
<br>
people in the mid-east want to bet on the strong horse not the weak one.
<br>
Lots of people, yourself included , were predicting that the Arab street would
<br>
erupt in outrage if America bombed Afghanistan, we were already seeing
<br>
huge demonstrations supporting Bin Laden, people were naming their
<br>
children after him for heaven's sake.  But all that stopped very abruptly,
<br>
it stopped the second it became obvious that America was going to win.
<br>
It's amazing how well a 15,000 pound fuel air bomb can win over the hearts
<br>
and minds of people.

<p><em>    &gt;There is much in US culture and especially in our media that

<p>Unlike that deep, intelligent, benevolent, fun loving culture called The Taliban.
