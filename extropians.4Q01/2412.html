<p>[Posted November 9, 2001]
<br>
<p>&quot;How do I respond when I see that in some Islamic countries there is
<br>
vitriolic hatred for America? I'll tell you how I respond: I'm amazed. I
<br>
just can't believe it, because I know how good we are.&quot; --President George
<br>
W. Bush
<br>
<p>Before we celebrate the bombings of Afghanistan with hope of their expansion
<br>
to other countries, let's pause and take a look back on the past fifty years
<br>
of U.S. folly in the Middle East.
<br>
<p>1949--Syria
<br>
Defeat in the war against Israel discredits the ruling French-allied
<br>
civilian regime. American agents and interests take the opportunity to
<br>
provide support to Colonel Husni az-Zaim in a coup against the civilian
<br>
regime. American agents call az-Zaim &quot;our boy&quot; and &quot;Husni,&quot; but when they
<br>
arrive to inform the new dictator whom to appoint as his ambassadors and
<br>
cabinet, az-Zaim orders them to &quot;stand at attention&quot; and to address him as
<br>
&quot;His Excellency.&quot; Syria turns against the U.S. and descends into a series of
<br>
coups and counter-coups and police-state government by quasi-military
<br>
regimes.
<br>
<p>1952--Egypt
<br>
American influence and assistance backs the conspiracy of Gammal Abdel
<br>
Nasser's Free Officers to oust the Egyptian royal family, the British
<br>
post-colonial client regime in Egypt. The U.S. expects Nasser to support
<br>
Washington's anti-Soviet alliance in the Middle East, dubbed the Baghdad
<br>
Pact, but he turns against the U.S. U.S. agents support Colonel Mohammad
<br>
Naguib's attempt to overthrow Nasser, as well as later assassination
<br>
attempts.
<br>
<p>In 1956, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles rescinds pledges of
<br>
foreign aid for the Aswan Dam project. In response, Nasser uses this as a
<br>
pretext to nationalize the Suez Canal, and uses its toll revenue to fund the
<br>
dam. Britain, France, and Israel in response launch a joint invasion of
<br>
Egypt with plans to occupy the Suez Canal. Arab support for the U.S. reaches
<br>
its highest point when President Eisenhower, out of a distaste for European
<br>
colonialism and European intervention in the Middle East, pressures the
<br>
invading forces to abandon their invasion of Egypt.
<br>
<p>1953--Iran
<br>
After the government announces plans to grant the Soviet Union a territorial
<br>
oil franchise in Northern Iran, modeled on the British one in the south for
<br>
the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, a local leader named Mohammed
<br>
Mosaddeq leads the successful popular movement to oppose the grant to the
<br>
Soviets and pushes further to nationalize all foreign oil facilities.
<br>
Mosaddeq's popularity and influence increase to the degree that the shah
<br>
appoints him prime minister.
<br>
<p>Faced with economic and political turmoil, the shah attempts to remove
<br>
Mosaddeq but is met with mobs and mass public demonstrations, causing the
<br>
shah to flee the country. The CIA then backs Mosaddeq's opponents, who then
<br>
overthrow his administration and sentence him to house arrest for the rest
<br>
of his life. The shah is restored and becomes America's best friend and now
<br>
controls the nationalized British oil facilities as well. Eventually,
<br>
opposition to the shah's autocracy and U.S. political domination, as well as
<br>
the Savak--the U.S.-trained Iranian secret police--grows into a nationalist
<br>
revolution to oust the shah and the West, and in 1979, Iran too turns
<br>
against the U.S.
<br>
<p>1958--Iraq
<br>
In opposition to the British-client Iraqi regime, and in opposition also to
<br>
Nasser's growing influence in Iraq, the bloodthirsty Colonel Kassem
<br>
spearheads the American-supported military coup to overthrow the Iraqi royal
<br>
family. The king and crown prince and most of the royal family are executed,
<br>
and the prime minister is murdered by a mob. Years later, after Kassem has
<br>
alienated all his allies except the Soviet Union and is overthrown and
<br>
executed in 1963, United States support swings to a small group called the
<br>
Ba'th Socialist Party. After many twists and turns, coups and elections,
<br>
coups and revolutions, Saddam Hussein emerges as president of Iraq in 1976
<br>
after leading the coup that, with American insistence, installed that regime
<br>
in 1968.
<br>
<p>1958--Lebanon
<br>
After the Iraqi monarchy is overthrown, the president of Lebanon requests
<br>
U.S. military intervention to save his tottering regime from insurrections
<br>
of United Arab Republican sympathizers. U.S. Marines arrive the next day in
<br>
Beirut. Lebanon enters into a thirty-five-year period of instability and
<br>
civil war.
<br>
<p>1969--Libya
<br>
In 1959, oil is discovered, which transforms the country. To elbow out the
<br>
British, American support flows to a young reformist colonel in the Libyan
<br>
army, Muammar al-Khadafy, who, once in power, turns against his U.S.
<br>
sponsors, under the pretext of Western exploitation of Arab oil. He
<br>
confiscates and nationalizes oil facilities and assets, including those of
<br>
the local Jewish and Italian communities.
<br>
<p>1980--Iraq
<br>
With the Islamic revolution in Iran, the U.S. tilts toward Iraq and Saddam
<br>
Hussein as its proxy against the Iranians. Iraq and Hussein become America's
<br>
front line in its attempt to crush the Islamic revolution in Iran. Armed and
<br>
financed by Uncle Sam, Saddam invades Iran in 1980. The war would last for
<br>
eight years and kill nearly a million people. Iraq is given advice and
<br>
intelligence from the CIA and the Pentagon, and U.S. and British
<br>
administrations provide Iraq with chemical and biological weapons-making
<br>
knowledge and materiel to use against the Iranians. We all know how this
<br>
turned out, but this time was different. The U.S. turned on Saddam.
<br>
<p>1983--Lebanon
<br>
With the country invaded by Israel and under threat of Syrian domination,
<br>
American Marine &quot;Peacekeepers&quot; are shipped to Beirut. Opposition to their
<br>
presence leads to the suicide bombing of the barracks. Some 309 Americans
<br>
are killed, including the CIA's Mideast staff. In 1985, Lebanese CIA agents
<br>
detonate a truck bomb in Beirut in an attempt to assassinate Sheikh
<br>
Fadlallah, leader of the Hezbollah faction suspected of blowing up the
<br>
American barracks two years earlier. Eighty-three civilians are killed and
<br>
240 wounded; Sheikh Fadlallah walks out of the mosque fifteen minutes later.
<br>
<p>1986--Libya
<br>
In retaliation for the terrorist bombing of a Berlin nightclub that killed a
<br>
U.S. soldier, President Reagan bombs Libya, causing 130 deaths, including
<br>
civilians near the French embassy. Khadafy's own residence is targeted,
<br>
killing his adopted infant daughter, in an attempt to assassinate him. Libya
<br>
is deliberately chosen as the target because it lacks defenses against air
<br>
bombing.  A few months later, the U.S. admits to arms-trading with Iran, a
<br>
state that the U.S. openly calls an instigator of &quot;international terrorism,&quot;
<br>
and one that is an ally of Libya. Arab cynicism about U.S. intentions and
<br>
trustworthiness could only increase. The bombing of Pan Am 103 is considered
<br>
revenge for these attacks on Libya.
<br>
<p>1991--Iraq &amp; Kuwait
<br>
After the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, April Gillespie, informs Saddam that the
<br>
U.S. would have no opinion on Iraq's occupation of its &quot;nineteenth
<br>
province,&quot; the U.S. seizes the opportunity to justify its post-cold war
<br>
internationalism by dubbing Saddam the &quot;new Hitler.&quot; After mass slaughter
<br>
and defeat, crippling sanctions and daily bombardment follow to persuade the
<br>
Iraqi people that perhaps they would be better off without Saddam. Other
<br>
observers, however, believe that the sanctions exist to prop up the price of
<br>
oil.
<br>
<p><p>1995--Afghanistan
<br>
The U.S. covertly aids the Taliban militia in its drive to end the
<br>
post-Soviet-Afghani civil war. The U.S. sides with fundamentalist forces in
<br>
Afghanistan--but not in Egypt, Algeria, or Saudi Arabia, where they are
<br>
tortured and suppressed--in a foreign theater of the U.S. drug war. The U.S.
<br>
government and the fundamentalist opposition to drugs would conjoin in an
<br>
alliance to drive out Central Asian opium production.
<br>
<p>1996--Iraq
<br>
President Clinton instructs the CIA to support and aid the Iraqi opposition
<br>
forces in an operation to finally do away with Saddam Hussein. Iraqi exiles
<br>
and refugees are trained and armed in the northern no-fly zone to descend on
<br>
Baghdad. Sympathetic army generals within the regime are cultivated to
<br>
assassinate Hussein, and efforts to destabilize Iraq begin--such as random
<br>
car bombings as well as bombings of civilian public places.This plot
<br>
collapses, however, as Saddam's spies have infiltrated the Kurds. Many Kurds
<br>
back Saddam and turn on the U.S.-Kurdish faction. CIA agents in Kurdistan
<br>
run for their lives, abandoning allies and tons of equipment and documents,
<br>
and the network within Iraq is exposed and eliminated. This catastrophic
<br>
failure leads to the firing of CIA chief John Deutch. Commentator Eric
<br>
Margolis dubs this &quot;Clinton's Bay of Camels,&quot; after JFK's Bay of Pigs
<br>
fiasco.
<br>
<p>1998--The Sudan &amp; Afghanistan:
<br>
President Clinton, in the midst of impeachment, rocket attacks camps in
<br>
Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan, ostensibly to punish
<br>
suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden for his involvement in the bombing of
<br>
two American embassies in Africa.
<br>
<p>After 1945, the U.S. schemed to eject the bankrupt British and French
<br>
colonial empires in the Middle East--to elbow out Soviet influence, but,
<br>
more likely, to secure political control over its oil. America's Oil Raj, as
<br>
some commentators call the interdependent network of political, monetary,
<br>
and military relationships--mirroring Britain's collection of territories
<br>
and petty kingdoms on the Indian subcontinent--consists of the old imposed
<br>
artificial colonial client states created by Britain and France. Outside of
<br>
this &quot;Oil Raj&quot; exists a trade-sanction regime that the U.S. maintains on
<br>
Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Algeria, the Sudan, Afghanistan, and, until
<br>
recently, India and Pakistan--all some of the poorest places in the world.
<br>
<p>The Cycle Continues
<br>
The U.S. sends billions in financial and military aid to Egypt, Saudi
<br>
Arabia, and Jordan each year to prop up these regimes against
<br>
&quot;fundamentalist&quot; popular Islamic movements (which are the only way dissent
<br>
can be expressed in these regimes, since Islam is the only thing these
<br>
rulers can't outlaw). The U.S. also gives political support to corrupt and
<br>
oppressive dictatorships, such as exist in Algeria and Tunisia. Everywhere,
<br>
the U.S. favors and aids the status quo of political repression and
<br>
dictatorship. This hypocrisy is what fuels Arab and Muslim anger.
<br>
<p>Foreign Affairs commentator Eric Margolis noted recently the continuing
<br>
cycle of American political involvement in the Middle East. He points out
<br>
that in nearly every decade since the mid-fifties, a president of the United
<br>
States has faced a challenge of a Muslim peril, an Arab or Muslim bogeyman
<br>
that is everywhere and nowhere--Nasser, Khomeni, Khadafy, Saddam, and, now,
<br>
bin Laden.  And every time, the results have been the same: U.S. demonizes
<br>
this single man, only to watch him grow into a popular hero of the Arab
<br>
masses--the Arabic or Islamic David that dares to stand up and confront the
<br>
U.S. oil dominion over the Arab world and the economic and political
<br>
distortion that the US leaves in its wake.
<br>
<p>Now, the cycle is beginning again with Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and
<br>
Osama bin Laden.  And it has been reported that in the Middle East over the
<br>
past few years, Osama has become the most common name for newborn boys.
