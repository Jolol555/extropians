<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, the funniest statement I've seen all day. First she declares that

</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; those societies better, that they are a religion of peace, despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; muslims holding a near-monopoly on terrorism around the world, and that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other cultures enough, etc etc etc....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those might be views that a relativist would hold, but not inherently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; linked to relativism. Cultural relativism is the belief that no way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, language, body of folk traditions, religion, cuisine, choice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion, etc. is inherently superior to any other. This, tempered by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common sense (e.g. let's draw the line at cannibalism and slavery) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eminently compatible with Western democractic, libertarian culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The opposite of relativism would be extreme chauvinism including the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;America love it or leave it&quot; variety as well as the &quot;Death to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infidels&quot; variety.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unsurprisingly relativism is highly vulnerable to missense mutations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the one I'll call absolute relativism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolute relativism is the belief that not only is everybody free to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe what they want, not only that you are *potentially* as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistaken as everybody else, but that everybody else is *actually* as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right as you are. Where a normal relativist says &quot;I believe 'A' but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be swayed toward 'B' if somebody can prove to me that 'B' is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more consistant with my other memes than 'A'&quot; an absolute relativist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says &quot;'A' and 'B' (and all other memes everywhere) have exactly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same truth value&quot;. This creates all kinds of interesting dilemmas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like mutually exclusive statements being equally right, or relativism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself being on an equal footing with absolutism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If absolute relativists (and their less sophisticated flag-burning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cousins the leftilists) had paid more attention in philosophy class,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would realize that this is a solved problem. The answer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existentialism. If existentialism proves too convoluted (which it well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may, since hardly anybody except me will ever give you a straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer as to what the hell it even IS) I refer the world to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; streamlined and enhanced Existentialism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pro. <a href="http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=697549">http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=697549</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I don't believe that Samantha is an absolute relativist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because if she was, it would be impossible for her to disagree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you or anybody else. I also don't believe her assertion that she is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a relativist at all, since some degree of relativism is pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much a prerequisite for being a rational, modern individual.
</em><br>
<p>Which is why I called her a dogmatic relativist, not an absolute
<br>
relativist (an absolute dogmatic relativist being more like the former
<br>
than the latter). A dogmatic relativist is hostile to objective opinions
<br>
and to those proposing that there are even such things as objective
<br>
truths or opinions. Relativism denies that extropy is inherently better
<br>
than entropy, since entropic behavior is an inherently valid lifestyle
<br>
choice. As a result, relativism is itself entropic since it seeks not to
<br>
judge, to choose, between extropy and entropy. Doing nothing is the same
<br>
as being entropic since the natural trend of any system at rest is
<br>
entropic.
<br>
<p>Dying off from heat death, to relativists, is a perfectly valid
<br>
lifestyle choice, and extropy, being a philosophy that makes objective
<br>
judgements about entropy, is obviously a construct of
<br>
paternalistic/imperialistic northern european male capitalist domination
<br>
elites.
<br>
<p>I'll bet that even at the Omega point there will be relativists
<br>
objecting to attempts to exist beyond the end of the universe or to
<br>
change its natural course of evolution.
