Outtakes from PBS:
<br>
Years of effort have gone into cyc. There are millions of facts and
<br>
relationships in its database. But it still has less understanding of the
<br>
world than a young child. Creating a machine that has common sense is an
<br>
immense challenge. (Lenat) will say &quot;right&quot; to that. Some ai researchers
<br>
believe that the best way to build machines which can understand the world the
<br>
way we do, is to make them even more like us. A team at mit's artificial
<br>
intelligence lab has been working on cog, a humanoid robot which experiences
<br>
the world in much the same way we do - through a human-like body and senses
<br>
which mimic our own. (Brooks) inside every ai researcher is someone who wants
<br>
to build the ultimate intelligence. And i think all of us are ultimately
<br>
inspired by hal-9000. We want to build that intelligence at the human level.
<br>
<em>&gt;From my work I came to believe that it was important to have a body and to
</em><br>
interact in the world and to interact with people in a human like way in order
<br>
for the system to be able to learn how to be human. I think in hindsight that
<br>
hal was a technological mistake in thinking that it could be as intelligent as
<br>
it was without a body. So I've been pushing at looking at robots with a human
<br>
form. (Brian Scassellati ) the cog project started about seven years ago. And
<br>
in that time, we've changed a little bit of our focus - the way we look at
<br>
things and the kinds of questions we ask. But we've always been focused on two
<br>
goals really - building a complete engineering system, trying to put together
<br>
all of these different pieces. And also in terms of trying to understand
<br>
something about human intelligence by building a real machine. The robot has a
<br>
visual system. There's two cameras in each eye, one gives it a wide field of
<br>
view...
<br>
<p>...one by one with its corresponding amplitude, and you can see in the output,
<br>
you very qu ickly form a very accurate reconstruction of that individual.
<br>
Recognizing faces from photographs is easy for a computer, compared to the
<br>
problem of recognizing what's happening in a scene from real life. The holy
<br>
grail of vision research is scene analysis - not just recognizing faces or
<br>
objects, but describing and understanding the dynamics of a whole scene. At
<br>
mit's artificial intelligence lab, researchers have been developing a system
<br>
to analyze the events taking place in the surrounding environment. During a
<br>
typical day, hundreds of pedestrians and vehicles move around the lab in
<br>
patterns which the computer has learned to recognize. Having learned the
<br>
normal patterns of activity, the computer can also recognize when something
<br>
unusual happens. Systems like this will one day be in use in places like
<br>
embassies and airports, analyzing the flow of people and objects and alerting
<br>
security forces to any suspicious activities. The forest of sensors is a
<br>
project that has been running for about the past three years and we've had
<br>
five cameras running continuously in the mit artificial intelligence lab from
<br>
the 7th floor looking down at the surrounding area and tracking the cars and
<br>
people and trash and whatever else happens to be moving in the environment.
<br>
And the goal of the project is essentially to model the environment. Model the
<br>
objects in the environment and what those objects do over time. In the upper
<br>
left, we have the view from a single camera. Next to it we see where the
<br>
camera believes objects are moving. Here comes an object and you can see in
<br>
the lower right that object being tracked...
<br>
<p>...1960's, when Clarke was writing 2001, most computers looked like this - an
<br>
ibm workhorse, used by medium-sized businesses to run their accounts. It was
<br>
manned by specially trained personnel, driven by a 100 - year-old technology -
<br>
punched cards - and its output device was a teletype. What would a computer be
<br>
like in the year 2001? To find out, Clarke and Kubrick consulted experts in a
<br>
new branch of computer science called &quot;ai&quot; - artificial intelligence. Many of
<br>
the experts, then as now, were at mit - the massachusetts institute of
<br>
technology. Ai pioneer marvin minsky was one of the advisors on the film.
<br>
(Marvin minsky) kubrick came to visit mit when he was planning the film. In
<br>
fact he went to all the universities . He was particularly interested not in
<br>
whether the computers would be intelligent by 2001 but in the vision itself of
<br>
the film. He wanted to get some idea of what would be the state of computer
<br>
graphics in the future and what the computers would do for the spaceship and
<br>
that sort of thing. And I think he got all of that right. (Rod brooks) back in
<br>
1968, ai was dealing with teletype input where you could type a very simple
<br>
phrase or a very simple mathematical equation and the system could echo back
<br>
with some analysis of it. There was no real-time vision; there was hardly any
<br>
vision at all - maybe of a single photograph, taking many hours to compute.
<br>
There was no speech understanding. So to have a computer which could interact
<br>
with people on the same basis that people used was something that was clearly
<br>
far in the future. [Aram katchaturian's &quot;gayane ballet suite&quot; plays] in the
<br>
early days of ai in the 1960's, the ultimate test for machine intelligence was
<br>
considered to be the game of chess...
