<p>While I have no objection to the spirit of Eliezer's comments I
<br>
think it would be irrational to embrace the perspective without
<br>
a careful examination of where it becomes problematic.
<br>
<p>I *agree* with the perspective that &quot;races&quot; are generated due to a
<br>
pre-programmed human &quot;need&quot; to create imaginary dividing lines
<br>
(e.g. tribalize) others.  This is an important for a social animal
<br>
such as a human to establish &quot;trust&quot; relationships.  (Who will
<br>
share food with me, who will try to steal my mate, etc.)
<br>
<p>A quick Google gives a historical perspective here:
<br>
<a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f00/web2/ramon2.html">http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f00/web2/ramon2.html</a>
<br>
<p>While &quot;celebrating&quot; colorblindness may be a noble idea, it ignores
<br>
reality.  I believe it derives from the 2nd paragraph of the Declaration
<br>
of Independence:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is with the phrase &quot;all Men are created Equal&quot;.
<br>
Its *bunk*.  We are *not* created equal and could not be unless
<br>
we were clones of one another.  We all have 5-10 genetic polymorphisms
<br>
that can be considered &quot;personal&quot; handicaps that we share with some
<br>
other fraction of humanity.  Some of us may have more some of us may
<br>
have fewer.  The simple bell curve of intelligence and the fact that
<br>
a significant fraction of intelligence is heritable demonstrates that
<br>
we are not &quot;created equal&quot;.  The fact that some of us carry genetic
<br>
variants in melanin production is not a good basis for classifying
<br>
individuals.  However, the facts are that there *are* genes that
<br>
cosegregate (e.g. genes physically close to those regulating melanin
<br>
production) and there are population groups with higher abundances
<br>
of certain alleles (e.g. hemoglobin polymorphisms causing sickle
<br>
cell anemia).  So while the concept of &quot;race&quot; may not be useful,
<br>
&quot;absolute colorblindness&quot; is also undesirable in specific contexts
<br>
(e.g. medical diagnosis).
<br>
<p>The idea that we can all be considered &quot;equal&quot; is fundamentally flawed.
<br>
What we should be striving for is enhancing inalienable rights,
<br>
such that everyone has equal opportunities for &quot;Life, Liberty and
<br>
the Pursuit of Happiness&quot; (as they define them).
