<p>I think that if the United States had realized, that far back in time, how
<br>
much the threat of nuclear war - and later, nanotechnological war and
<br>
biological war - would hang over the heads of future generations, the
<br>
correct decision would have been to spend the lives necessary to subdue
<br>
Japan the hard way.  The US was the first to acquire nuclear weapons, and
<br>
then immediately used them, in war, against a nonnuclear opponent's
<br>
cities.  This is not a good precedent if some country other than the US is
<br>
the first to acquire military nanotechnology.  This does not help the US's
<br>
argument for nuclear nonproliferation.
<br>
<p>I think it would have been worth subduing Japan the hard way in order to
<br>
establish the principle that non-first-use of weapons of mass destruction,
<br>
even when the lives of your country's soldiers are at stake or whatever,
<br>
is an absolute, inviolable principle - that who wins or loses some war
<br>
between nations isn't worth dragging existential risks (planetary risks)
<br>
into the equation.  We blew our chance to establish that principle almost
<br>
immediately.  It's depressing.
<br>
<p>If dropping the A-bomb had been a single decision, with no implications
<br>
for the future, then it probably would have been the right decision.  But
<br>
there was more at stake in the decision to drop the A-bomb than the people
<br>
of that time knew.  It wasn't just a question of minimizing total war
<br>
casualties, as was thought, but of establishing precedents for handling
<br>
existential risks.  So I'm not blaming them, but I still think they made
<br>
the wrong decision.
