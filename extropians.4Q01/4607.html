<p>
(this originated as an offlist response that may give a bit more
<br>
idea to what I'm on about)
<br>
<p>That is a surprisingly difficult thing to really answer.  
<br>
<p>Spirituality to me is bundled up with a distinct reality view
<br>
that I
<br>
will label &quot;Primacy of Consciousness&quot;.  It is the view behind
<br>
(largely) the philosophical school of Idealism and is the
<br>
axiomatic view that most mysticism and arguably most major
<br>
religions grow out of.  It is usually seen as opposed by or to
<br>
the &quot;Primacy of Matter&quot; which is largely what other
<br>
philosophical schools such as Rationalist, Pragmatist and so on
<br>
grow out of.  It is where much of the scientific worldview is
<br>
based.  
<br>
<p>Now, I am an odd fish because I can look at the universe from
<br>
either of those two very different worldviews and live within
<br>
either for varying periods of time fairly comfortably.  Yet
<br>
neither one seems totally comfortable and complete.  So I end up
<br>
doing a sort of bipolar dance in between a lot.  
<br>
<p>One possible meeting place is that with Singularity on the
<br>
horizon it increasingly becomes true that Mind overrides (if you
<br>
will) Matter increasingly.  In a way, the two horns of my
<br>
dilemna bend around and join up possibly somewhere down the
<br>
road.  (pure speculation for sure)
<br>
<p>So what do I mean by spirituality?  It includes a very
<br>
optimistic viewpoint that Mind/Consciousness ultimately
<br>
determines everything.  We have tremendous freedom to design
<br>
ourselves, our world[s], our lives as we wish.  So why not use
<br>
that freedom to design our ethics and interactions with one
<br>
another and even within our own mind to that which we most
<br>
believe is conducive to how we would like to live and be?  To me
<br>
this includes a lot of what looks like traditional spiritual
<br>
maxims of loving and caring about the unfolding and well-being
<br>
of one another. It includes not lying, not harming one another
<br>
and not being tripped out with just getting more and more of
<br>
whatever Stuff it is we try to convince ourselves will fix us up
<br>
and make us happy.  It is about learning to deeply trust and
<br>
open to each other.  It is very much about creating a world of
<br>
such abundance that competition and fighting over limited
<br>
resources becomes largely pointless.
