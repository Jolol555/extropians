<p>Citizens and foreign nationals pulled in in an open sweep on no

grounds or very weak grounds or their nationality or the

ethnicity or their religion or age and gender or some

combination ... are &quot;prisoners of war&quot;?  Excuse me?

<p>People do not have the right to say &quot;I don't know&quot; without
<br>
having their minds tampered with by force to see if maybe they
<br>
do know or say they do under such influences and coercion? 
<br>
Since when?  
<br>
<p>The majority of these people are not even accused of having
<br>
knowledge but are brought in just in case they do or in order
<br>
for the government to look like it is doing something, even if
<br>
it is wrong, morally questionable and very dangerous to human
<br>
and civil rights.  It is up to us to take note and to question.
