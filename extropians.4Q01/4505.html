<p>Leaving Samantha's faith fully laced for the moment, what about turning
<br>
your efforts to winning the million bucks allegedly available at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.victorzammit.com/challenge.html">http://www.victorzammit.com/challenge.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt; One million dollars is offered to any skeptic who can rebut the evidence
<br>
for the existence of the afterlife. &gt;
<br>
<p>&lt; The applicant has to rebut the substantive objective evidence presented
<br>
in Victor Zammit's A Lawyer Presents the Case for the Afterlife
<br>
<a href="http://www.victorzammit.com/book">http://www.victorzammit.com/book</a> (see chapters 3 to 24) which includes:
<br>
Materialisation, Electronic Voice Phenomena, Instrumental
<br>
Transcommunication, the Scole Experiments, Professor Gary Schwartz'
<br>
Experiments, Mediumship - Mental, Physical and Direct Voice, Xenoglossy,
<br>
the Cross-Correspondences, Proxy Sittings, Automatic Etheric Writing,
<br>
Laboratory Experiments, Poltergeists, Apparitions together with the
<br>
evidence provided by Near Death Experiences and Out of Body Experiences
<br>
which psychics claim are supportive of and are directly linked with the
<br>
afterlife.
<br>
&nbsp;Further, the applicant has to rebut the afterlife evidence presented by
<br>
the following: Arthur Findlay's On the Edge of the Etheric, Sir William
<br>
Crookes' On Human Personality and Researches in the Phenomena of
<br>
Spiritualism; Sir Oliver Lodge's Raymond and Geraldine Cummins' Swan on a
<br>
Black Sea and the evidence provided by the Inner Peace Movement. &gt;
<br>
<p>In Popperian terms, alas, the `challenge' makes no sense at all, but it
<br>
might be amusing to hit the silly fellow with some heavy logic and evidence.
