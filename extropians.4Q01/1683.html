<p><em>&gt;Societies of these people are more likely to outcompete other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groups of people who don't have it. Perhaps it allows these groups of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people to &quot;stop worrying&quot; and get on with work that might help them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survive? Or is religion just a fluke- the brain hardware only seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generate feelings of deep meaning and &quot;joy&quot;, perhaps feeling attached
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to your surroundings and people helped those people and societies do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better, and later on those feelings got interpreted by individuals to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be significant- boom, you get religions.
</em><br>
<p>Religions are ubiquitous in human societies, so any &quot;accident&quot; has been
<br>
tolerated by evolution.  Group selection is always a weak force and not
<br>
a good candidate for explaining complex systems.  The continued 
<br>
existence of religion indicates that people with more developed 
<br>
&quot;God modules&quot; have more kids than others in the same society.
<br>
[Technically, it only indicates this is so in primitive societies
<br>
somewhat less religiously inclined than us.]
<br>
<p>But remember - that means religion is good *for our genes* - NOT
<br>
necessarily good for us.  Genes are stupid, unfeeling things, and
<br>
their benefit doesn't deserve veneration.  Would you want to zap
<br>
birth control?
