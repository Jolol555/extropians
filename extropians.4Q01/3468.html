</em><br>
<p>Yes, and as Tony and Philip also pointed out by our current
<br>
understanding of the meaning of democracy they would not be very
<br>
democratic. In many ways democracy is a moving target.
<br>
<p>In any case, the conclusion seems to be that even nominally democratic
<br>
countries can go to war against each other, but the probability
<br>
decreases quickly as they become more free.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My own term for this political condition is called &quot;rump democracies&quot; or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better yet; &quot;rump republics&quot;. I have no way yet of answering Anders request 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of an art, then a science. There are questions to be answered, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always, on definitions.
</em><br>
<p>I also think we should not rely too much on indices - methodological
<br>
difficulties abound with them. And freedom and citizens influence are
<br>
definitely multidimensional - in the US you have far more economical
<br>
freedom than here in Sweden, but at least in some respects it seems we
<br>
have a more accessible government. Indices are just a convenient
<br>
shorthand, and sometimes revealing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the trend is, despite Orwell's warnings on technology and dictatorships, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward using technology to liberate people economically and financially, at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least, then are we are really headed towards a democratic plutocracy? Or is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a democracy with all members having an investment stake? This last 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence puts me in mind of Moravec's Robot, is which his suggestions that a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world in which robots manufacture all goods and most services, produce &quot;lazy&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracies. 
</em><br>
<p>Could be, although I am always suspicious about computer scientists
<br>
talking about economics and sociology (yes, I'm one of them). The trend
<br>
seems to have been towards giving all humans rights, and extending their
<br>
freedoms, so taking this to the extreme would be giving rights to nearly
<br>
anything (maybe not just rights for AIs and posthumans but partial
<br>
rights to animals and even some &quot;rights&quot; to non-sentient objects) and
<br>
with maximal freedom (freedom is obviously limited by the freedom of
<br>
others and material constraints). Sounds like some libertarian utopia or
<br>
Bank's Culture to me. But we should not stare to much at imaginary
<br>
futures when we have a nearby future to shape...
