<em>&gt; Now, who exactly is &quot;they&quot;? Don't we first have to find out, before we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually speak about &quot;members of their group&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Unless you've been in a coma for the last three months, I should think it
<br>
would be obvious that &quot;they&quot; are the terrorist groups (bin Laden, et al.) who
<br>
contrived the September 11, 2001 attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about this Oklahoma lunatic, for example. Who was &quot;they&quot; in that case?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every white person? Every white christian person? Every person of his home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; town or state?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course... and the Japanese who bombed Pearl Harbor were just
<br>
&quot;lunatics&quot; like Timothy McVeigh, right? ...and just because some &quot;lunatic&quot;
<br>
Germans bombed Europe and murdered millions of Jews, that was no excuse for
<br>
the Allies to try to take out Hitler and his minions, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's say tomorrow they put you in a detention camp. Maybe you wear the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong beard or they got the wrong address, whatever. Would it be okay for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, to be deprived of every chance to inform your family, speak to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyer, tell your boss, try to clear the misunderstanding?
</em><br>
<p>Now, who exactly is &quot;they&quot;? Don't we first have to find out, before we can
<br>
&nbsp;actually speak about members of their group depriving you of every chance to
<br>
inform your family, etc.?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, the Geneva convention was made for &quot;regular&quot; wars, where the parties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be clearly identified. I haven't seen detention camps for suspected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mafia members yet.
</em><br>
<p>Since this isn't a &quot;regular&quot; war, there's no justification for you to bemoan
<br>
the irregularities of its conduct. The idea of detention camps for suspected
<br>
Mafia members would probably play well with MADD (Mothers Against Disreputable
<br>
Delinquents).
<br>

<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
