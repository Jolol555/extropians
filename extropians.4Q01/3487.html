<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, Mike, but when trials are closed, it's too easy to accuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anyone of being anything, whether they are or not.  PUBLIC trials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for all offenses are a fundamental human right everywhere, under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all conditions, without exception.  Anyone who proposes closed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trials for any reason is an enemy of freedom and justice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, public trials for all offenses, provided the accused agrees to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; surrender for trial with no caveats. If someone refuses to be captured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and remains a threat, how far should others risk their lives just so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they can have their trial whether they want it or not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That was not the issue here.  The issue was whether military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tribunals are appropriate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So? You are assuming that they will not be made public, to start with.
</em><br>
<p>The point is to have the trial, much of the evidence, perhaps
<br>
even the charges not public and also to remove many rights of
<br>
the accused, even if not citizens, including the right to
<br>
counsel of their choice, right to appeal, right to know the
<br>
charges before hand and ones accusers.  In short it makes a
<br>
total mockery of Justice from end to end. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, public trials are actually NOT the right of every person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have a right to a trial by a jury of your peers. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is nothing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the constitution that says that the trial has to be public as it &gt;occurs.
</em><br>
<p>Public is not the primary issue and I think you know that and
<br>
know that I know that.  So I will assume this is a debating
<br>
ploy.
