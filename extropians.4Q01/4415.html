<em>&gt; Spike, I tend to agree with Samantha here.  I don't believe

</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, making a point against Samantha, I did see a PBS

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Reminds me of the special taxes and much worse that the Catholic

Church imposed.  But I doubt that this tax is a matter of firm

<p><em>&gt; Samantha's humanistic position is fine in principle (as

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggrievances of history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What lofty towers might those be?  Our &quot;lofty towers&quot; got
<br>
knocked down.  We
<br>
start from where we are.  The aggrievances of history are &quot;what
<br>
happened&quot;.
<br>
They do not determine what will happen next.  That is up to us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'll comment by simply asking the question of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;Why is the Islamic faith now followed by ~1 billion people?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly a majority of them were taught by their parents -- but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fundamental question becomes *what* fraction of original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; converts, from Jewish/Christian/Pagan religions, were &quot;voluntary&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Today?  Pretty much all of them.  In the past? It varies just as
<br>
it does
<br>
for Christianity. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While, I do not place Islam in the box that Spike does (Kill the infidels),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I cannot ignore the fact that it seems *highly* likely that many conversions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Islam were the result of coercion.  This is particularly true if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;tax the 'infidels'&quot; policy is accurate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This doesn't seem very relevant or helpful as far as determining
<br>
how we should
<br>
act now to further our goals.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, while some might claim that such expansions were a direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to the Crusades -- it becomes necessary to delve deeper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into Islamic history to determine precisely *how* the Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith spread out of Saudia Arabia in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You could do the same exercise with the spread of Chrisitianity
<br>
of course.
<br>
But what would be the point?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; While the Christian &quot;meme set&quot; has a seductive hook (everlasting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salvation) I am unsure as to what ideas in the Islamic faith have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;trumping&quot; meme.  If there are no trumping memes one can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude that Islam has been spread primarily by violence and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>For &quot;trumping memes&quot; or reasons people convert you need to talk
<br>
with the people and examine the faith.  It is probably pointless
<br>
to second-guess it here.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So, IMO, Samantha, Amara, Spike, et al have a number of problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Really?  I don't think so.  This is a strawman argument with a
<br>
bit of argument from authority thrown in.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; One can be a non-violent, pacifist, humanist, etc. but if one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does *not* wrestle with the problem of how to &quot;convert&quot; billions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of individuals with meme sets with 1000-2000 year histories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are in fundamental conflict with extropian principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. evidence is required) then a problem presents itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I have no need to convert anyone.  If they like the way I live
<br>
and think then they will look into it or try it on. If not,
<br>
not.  But I don't think all Muslims are uniform in the least or
<br>
that they have a firm memeset that is antithetical to peaceful
<br>
co-existence. I do not think that based on reading the Koran or
<br>
looking at history. 
<br>
<p>Nor do I think that any and all memesets that do not require
<br>
full materialistic-science evidence for important things are
<br>
automatically anti-extropian or in serious conflict with
<br>
extropianism.  It is possible to be very much for transforming
<br>
humanity and this planet using technology (among other things)
<br>
and still believe and live by quite a bit that does not have
<br>
this kind of evidence as to its validity.  I think this is a
<br>
very important thing to be aware of and to keep in mind also. 
<br>
Otherwise we too easily fall into a trap of assuming that any
<br>
but full rational, materialistic transhumanists are our
<br>
&quot;enemies&quot;.  This is not conducive to the spread of
<br>
transformative memes. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The problem is being non-violent, pacifistic, etc. is *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a surviving meme.  In a world where some fraction of individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will exploit the terrain, they will extract the resources from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals who allow them to do so, eliminating such individuals.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, non-violence has turned out to work surprisingly well
<br>
in some very nasty situations.  Ultimately, I believe a meme
<br>
that eschews physical violence from human/sentient relations is
<br>
essential to our well-being. That some of us may be taken
<br>
advantage by those who do not share that meme does not change
<br>
the value of the meme and certainly doesn't make it worthless.  
<br>
At some point sentient beings get tired of killing those who are
<br>
completely peaceful and who wish only to improve life for all. 
<br>
It is the rare psychopath who cannot be touched eventually by
<br>
such examples. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Christianity or Islam may be &quot;neutral&quot; (highly interpretable) religions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they do not impose *strong* constraints against *all* acts of aggression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then they are useless from a game-theoretic standpoint -- they do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promote increased trust and as a result increased survivability.
</em><br>
<p>I do not find the &quot;game&quot; of the game theory very interesting. 
<br>
Its rules are contrived.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Samantha and Amara choose to adopt nonviolent solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against individuals who choose violent solutions, their memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose -- simple, end of discussion.  
</em><br>
<p>The discussion is not over yet.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Now, Spike's more subtle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution of &quot;meme changing weapons&quot; is perhaps even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous -- it is the adoption of non-rational coercive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches to changing &quot;incorrect&quot; meme-sets.  It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an acceptence of the fact that we cannot win the battle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with reason and must resort to coercion instead.  To me this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems somewhat worse than the Islamic coercive method of imposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes on &quot;infidels&quot;.  At least in that situation I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially move to a non-Muslim environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Coercing minds directly is not the answer.  It is the
<br>
worse form of violence and enslavement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this is not a simple problem for either extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or humanity in general.  It is the fundamental question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;when can I not protect my meme set from your meme set?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why assume there is anything that requires such &quot;protection&quot;? 
<br>
Memes don't grow only or even primarily by force or by being
<br>
protected.  Some memes grow by simply being a better alternative
<br>
or by absorbing and transforming other memes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If your meme-set allows you to kill me to eliminate my meme-set,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then your meme-set is fundamentally dangerous.  If your meme-set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says you will never kill my meme-set, even to preserve your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meme-set, then it is a very noble meme-set but one that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily be taken advantage of, even eliminated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is not so easy to take advantage of as you may think.  The
<br>
British discovered this in India. The rascists discovered this
<br>
when facing the non-violence marches of the Civil Rights
<br>
movement.  The Russians discovered it for a time longer than
<br>
studying the military forces involved would allow in the &quot;Prague
<br>
Spring&quot;.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This gets into some very subtle issues as to when meme-sets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be voluntarily changed.  If an individual asserts that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their meme-set is correct, can never be modified and is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid than yours, then I would tend to label that person as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly dangerous to my survival.
</em><br>
<p>Assertions and clinging to regardless of evidence and the
<br>
melting of hearts are very diffrent things.  That a human is
<br>
dangerous in his current thinking and practices does not make
<br>
him less human or justify wiping him out with violence
<br>
proactively or attempting to wipe out what one believes to be
<br>
his memeset.  An attack will call out defensive behavior and
<br>
counter-attacks.  The interplay of memes and the spread of memes
<br>
that are actually helpful is more subtle.
