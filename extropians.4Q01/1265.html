<p>Sorry Rafal, I have to disagree here.  A few years ago the U.S.
<br>
added the 2nd part of your policy [wealth based tickets].
<br>
I think you have to demonstrate a net worth of around $1M.
<br>
The problem is that leaves the door wide open for people
<br>
who have accumulated that wealth through illegal means,
<br>
Russian mafia members or Columbian druglords for example.
<br>
<p>#### One of the measures in my concept of immigration law that I didn't
<br>
mention is filtering all persons who cannot prove a legitimate source of
<br>
their money or who have a criminal (felony) record (not necessarily all
<br>
types of crimes would be filtered, though). I shouldn't have used the word
<br>
&quot;anybody&quot; in my statement. 
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
In contrast, since members of my family did arrive in this
<br>
country where one sister worked as a servent to bring over
<br>
other sisters and brothers from Ireland I'm not so sure
<br>
that revoking that criteria is a good idea (unless one can
<br>
make the case that there is just cause for changing a policy
<br>
that has historically worked fairly successfully).
<br>
<p>#### I am here also on a family-type basis, and I do not have a snotty
<br>
attitude towards persons using this method to get here but I still think it
<br>
should be abolished. If you want your family members to come over, you can
<br>
pay for them. If they are young, speak English, have at least high-school
<br>
education, the price might be quite affordable. If they are none of the
<br>
above, you have to work harder and give more money if you want to have them
<br>
here. The case for dropping the policy is economical - you want to have
<br>
immigrant at least equivalent to the average American in terms of their
<br>
economic potential, if they are not, you demand additional compensation.
<br>
<pre>

<p>Mike has the right idea, &quot;How do you determine who is going
to be a positive contributing member of the crew and who is
going to be a detriment?&quot;.  Randy is trying to apply the
filter of education, Rafal is trying to apply the filter
of wealth (or more properly the demonstrated ability to
function productively in a capitalist economy).
<p>### Since the social world is very complicated, the methods used to achieve
good outcomes in social policy frequently need to take many factors into
account - in this case, education, age, health, previous records of
functioning in the society - all of them make for good crew members. 
<p>Allowing essentially unlimited immigration of young, highly intelligent
persons, who could significantly contribute within a short period of time to
research in computer science, biotechnology, nanotechnology, would
accelerate the development of the technologies so dear to Extropians.
Blocking these persons' access to the unique opportunities available in the
US will delay this progress. 
<p>Indiscriminate immigration (e.g. 25 000 000 people/year) would put a heavy
burden on the US society and again delay progress. 
<p>Therefore, the middle course, well regulated but not restrictive
immigration, is most likely to serve Extropian goals.  
<p>---
We do have concrete evidence that immigrants from Arab
countries have a negative trust quotient while immigrants
from Canada or Mexico would seem to have a positive trust
quotient.  While I hate to say it due to its political
uncorrectness should we not use that evidence to protect
ourselves?
<p>#### I don't like this idea - since 99+ % in Arab immigrants are not
terrorist material, protecting this country by a blanket denial of access,
without individual consideration (as in educational or financial testing)
would be IMHO rather unjust.
