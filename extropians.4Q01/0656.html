I like your cell phone idea, Robert. I assume the phones will be programmed to only call authorities? We have to think about cost. But we have a far worse problem than that and I'm not talking about the massive amount of land we would have to cover. The worst problem is for those cell phones to work there needs to be cellular towers every few miles. 1 grenade is probably all that is needed to take one of those out.

Subject:	TERRORISM: Finding bin Laden and related topics
<br>
<p><p>I've been wondering about the problem of finding bin Laden
<br>
and bringing him to justice.  Obviously the 5+ million dollar
<br>
price on his head hasn't worked so far.  It is reasonable to
<br>
assume this is in part due to fear of reprisals for whomever
<br>
provides the evidence that allows his capture.  But in part
<br>
it seems to me due to the fact that anyone who might weigh
<br>
in on the side of providing information to capture him (say
<br>
someone facing starvation) lacks the means to communicate
<br>
the crucial information regarding his whereabouts to the
<br>
people who can do something with it.
<br>
<p>Now, it would seem to me that a combination of satellite
<br>
phones, witness protection programs and perhaps telephone
<br>
access to &quot;known&quot; authoritative Islamic authorities might fix
<br>
this.  Air-drop satellite phones with clear instructions
<br>
on how to use them.  Allow people in Afganistan to talk
<br>
to educated Islamic moderates who can effectively counter
<br>
the bin Laden propaganda.  Then those individuals would
<br>
be morally comfortable in providing the information needed
<br>
to capture bin Laden.  If they are guaranteed &quot;removal&quot; from
<br>
the situation, future protection, and the reward -- I think
<br>
one would find a large number information sources.
<br>
<p>It may also be time to up the reward -- a look at the hit
<br>
on the impact to the U.S. and world economy, the costs
<br>
being spent on capturing him seems to suggest that $5M
<br>
is chump change.
<br>
<p>(And for Anders -- as to why this message is extropic -- the net
<br>
negative impact on world resources as we attempt to secure ourselves
<br>
is huge.  Resources dedicated to securing ourselves from untrustable
<br>
individuals are resources that cannot be dedicated to extropic
<br>
efforts.  How much of the funds that will go into the military
<br>
campaigns, increased security precautions, shifts of resources
<br>
from the Natl. Institutes of Health to the Dept. of Defense, etc.
<br>
is difficult to say.  I would argue that the longer bin Laden
<br>
remains an unconstrained entity -- the slower the growth of
<br>
extropic developments will be.)
<br>
<p>The post is also extropic from the perspective that by pointing
<br>
out how we might achieve more open communications and greater
<br>
information access we may defeat forces that oppose such ideas.
<br>
(Though I will agree it is going to be *really* hard to reverse
<br>
the brain-washing that radical Islamic schools are promoting.)
<br>
(Here one starts to wonder if a drug could be developed whose
<br>
effect would be to &quot;forget everything you have learned&quot; or
<br>
&quot;suppress&quot; all &quot;strong&quot; feelings).  I'm not even sure that I
<br>
want to open this can of worms.
<br>
<p>I'm unsure whether the capture of bin Laden and close associates
<br>
will &quot;solve&quot; the problem (I probably doubt that will be the case).
<br>
If so, then my gut feeling is that real nanotechnology and/or the
<br>
singularity have been postponed by perhaps 5-10 years.
