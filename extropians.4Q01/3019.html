<p>
The recent debate about US interventions in other countries is pointless
<br>
because of
<br>
the lack of non-US citizens on this list.
<br>
Most New Zealanders do not mind US interventions _as long as_ they see that
<br>
America is
<br>
not acting in its own interests and that it is acting altruistically towards
<br>
other people.
<br>
That said, the opinions of New Zealanders are sadly based on (a) what other
<br>
NZers tell them to think (b)
<br>
what they see on TV.
<br>
An example is East Timor. Recently, during the lead up to the independence
<br>
vote, when Timorese were being terrorised
<br>
by Indonesian militias, there were calls in this country by pacifist lefties
<br>
for the US to liberate East Timor.
<br>
They had the same anti-american feeling about the US _not _ invading East
<br>
Timor as when the US bombed
<br>
Serbia causing a few civilian casualties.
<br>
Also, the various anti-american americans on the list miss the point- the US
<br>
is reacting to the &quot;intervention&quot;
<br>
by Osama bin Ladens forces on its soil, so the retaliation in Afghanistan is
<br>
clearly different to other interventions in the past.
<br>
It is significant that the various and bloody Soviet interventions were
<br>
never demonised in teh same way as american
<br>
actions.
<br>
It may or may not be significant that Samantha assumes responsibiltiy for
<br>
all actions by individuals in the US
<br>
govt for the past 50 years...
<br>
The proper role for US foreign policy is to operate by principle rather than
<br>
benefit to US (these 2 are not mutually exclusive) . I am not sure why it is
<br>
not so since in new zealand the govt has often pursued an idealistic foreign
<br>
policy at cost to our relations with other countries eg the Labour govts
<br>
stance on nukes in 1985 resulting in terrorism by France on the Rainbow
<br>
Warrior and
<br>
the collapse of the ANZUS treaty with America. The reason is that NZ voters
<br>
wanted idealistic foreign policy and Labour wanted to be in govt, rather
<br>
than Labour being altruistic.
