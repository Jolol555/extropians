<em>&gt;It isn't *really* an important discussion now since we are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anywhere close to a resource constrained environment.
</em><br>
<p>You keep talking in terms of &quot;we&quot;, but shouldn't you be talking in terms of 
<br>
&quot;me&quot;?
<br>
What if you go broke (it could happen), and you need to get a job. There is 
<br>
only one job that you are qualified for AND that pays medical insurance. An 
<br>
immigrant however is better qualified than you, so he gets the job.  You get 
<br>
sick and cannot afford the operation to get well, and you cannot keep up 
<br>
your Alcor dues. So it's dust to dust...for YOU! :-)
<br>
<p>so now, all this is moot.  So how does the &quot;we&quot; fit into the Extropian 
<br>
scheme of things?  Resource are ultimately very local, or at least that is 
<br>
where resources matter the most....for YOU and for ME!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm going to end this comment for now because it is late.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But for Randy and people who think similarly, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ask you to consider --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;You must give up everything you are for what you might become&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Did you steal that credo from the &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; cult or did you make it up 
<br>
yourself?
