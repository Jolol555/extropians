<em>&gt;&gt; Someone suggested that perhaps I can set up an experimental community more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; easily in a &quot;ghost&quot; town. Some of you might like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consider this for your experimental societies too. Any comments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I actually looked into this a few years ago, as incorporated towns have very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broad powers at their disposal in some States.  However, at least in States
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where I looked it up, these towns automagically lose their incorporated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;status if their population falls below a certain number unless incorporation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is specially enacted by the State legislature (an exemption that maintains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;status regardless of population).  Therefore, most ghost towns no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have legal status as a town.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The State where I was most interested in was Nevada, which requires 250
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eligible voters to incorporate an area as a town and 150 voters to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incorporated status.  The State of Nevada bestows the Right of Home Rule to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incorporated townships (if they choose to exercise it -- most don't), which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gives them surprisingly broad powers to manage their own affairs.  By
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;manage their own affairs&quot; it means that the town can provide their own law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enforcement, courts, schools, fire departments, etc.  In short, Home Rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usually means that the State delegates all authority to local officials to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manage things how they wish within the region that is exercising home rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;authority.  &quot;Home Rule&quot; varies from State to State, with some states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;granting very broad and liberal interpretations of home rule, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;states essentially not granting it at all.  Many of the rural western states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have very favorable home rule structures.  Nevada has a very liberal right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of home rule that applies to incorporated townships.  Idaho grants home rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to counties; Boise county in Idaho (which does NOT contain the city by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same name) is famous for being a home rule county which rarely lets Federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agencies operate within its jurisdiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As I'm sure you've surmised by now, if you and a bunch of your friends take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over the government of a home rule region in a State that grants very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberal and broad home rule powers, it is about as close to having your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;country within a country as you are going to get.  Or if you don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take over a home rule region, buy a big chunk of land in Nevada or similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and have a bunch of your friends become registered voters in your township.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Having been in areas where the courts and law enforcement were strictly of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the home rule variety, I can say that in those regions the law is exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what the locals decide it is.  Worth mentioning is that a boatload of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exemptions to Federal laws exist if you are part of the local government in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a number of capacities.  Note that all the attendant problems of creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;governments and power structures apply, so be careful of what you wish for;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are a few home rule areas in the U.S. that I can only describe as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;oppressive in nature due to a few ambitious people taking over the system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That should be enough to get the imagination churning. :^)
</em><br>

<p><p><p>The county is also a very important governmental unit in the USA.
<br>
<p>Hence, I suggested on Cryonet that cryonicists &quot;take over&quot; Loving
<br>
County, Texas, pop 67.  The county seat, Mentone has 20 people.
