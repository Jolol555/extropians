<em>&gt; &gt;I hope you are joking.  Nuclear is cost-effective now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;without seriously killing an already ailing economy with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and utterly unnecessary 100-200% tax on gas.  I can see why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would propose something of this kind.  Especially since most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;our energy needs are not for cars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're discussing oil and gas needs, and planes, trucks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and automobiles are a huge portion (I think the majority)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of oil needs.  Can't put nuke plants on those.  I disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the cost analysis even for power plants, given current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental constraints.  If regs were more reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you might be correct for that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>As I mentioned in this or another posts you would convert the
<br>
cars and trucks (at least) to electric, fuel-cells and so on. 
<br>
We already pretty well know how to do this now.  We just need a
<br>
bit of incentive.  Getting out of dependence on Arab oil about
<br>
now might be incentive enough.  The nuclear plants generated
<br>
electrical power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But whatever the reality, I proposed a plan that allows for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oil/gas taxes go up gradually, year by year, until imports
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you're correct imports will stop after a year or two of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax increases, and taxes will then stabilize.  Because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature of the market, you're guaranteed that whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques were adopted to stop imports were highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient ones, the best that could be developed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of highly informed people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If the market was so efficient there would be no need for
<br>
screwing around with these taxes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Tax-induced depressionary effects should be stopped by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compensating for revenue increases with reductions in other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes.  That's an important point, and I forgot to mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>This is the old stupid game that fluctates economies out of
<br>
control. It is part of why our economy was going bust even
<br>
before 911.  Doing more such shenanigans is simply administering
<br>
more of the poison that has already seriously sickens us.  
<br>
<p>I would also point out that you aren't going to reach a lot of
<br>
extropian dreams without much more economical, clean, available
<br>
and sustainable power than you have today.  There are more than
<br>
sufficient incentives without slapping huge tariffs on.
