<em>&gt;It is &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; to point out that we have acted badly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in many instances and many countries?  
</em><br>
<p>It is anti-Americanism when you only attack one side and
<br>
deliberately and completely ignore the actions of others,
<br>
especially when their actions were worse, and the context in which
<br>
such actions were taken.
<br>
<p>You went on and on about the American bio-weapons program
<br>
blissfully unaware that the American program was terminated in
<br>
1972. The Soviets after signing the same treaty increased their
<br>
facilities a thousand fold. This is not conjecture, but documented
<br>
fact.
<br>
<p>There are a number of nations around the world developing bio-
<br>
weapons, we would be justified in having our own program for that
<br>
reason alone.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It is a matter of public record that we have done so if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trouble yourself to look.  Or would you rather simply label me and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ignore any facts that might be unsettling to your current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;position?  
</em><br>
<p><p>I am well aware that we backed regimes that from a retrospective
<br>
were bad for their peoples, I was in the Philipines during the
<br>
reign of Ferdinand Marcos, and a good friend in high school after
<br>
winning a science fair was a guest of the Shah of Iran, but you
<br>
completely ignore why.
<br>
<p>We were involved in a cold war with the former Soviets, Democracy
<br>
vs Totalitarianism for the fate of the world. Since we could not be
<br>
everywhere at the same time we had little choice but to back anyone
<br>
who opposed the Soviets, in most countries they were the only
<br>
choice. You also ignore the fact that we were not alone in this,
<br>
all those who opposed the Soviets also backed these regimes.
<br>
<p>We did not go around the world meddling for lack of better things
<br>
to do.
<br>
<p>These things have to be considered in their historical context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why do I bother?
</em><br>
<p>You are trying to solve problems using reason which is commendable.
<br>
I am merely trying to point out the holes in your reasoning.
<br>
<p>I am not out to label, nor tar-and-feather you. I find your
<br>
opinions valuable.
