Thanks for the exegesis, Chris.
<br>
<p>Now that I actually have (two!) copies of the First Edition in hand, I find
<br>
that many people have been giving the book's title as librarian/reader
<br>
shorthand. Most of the people I've talked to have elided the definite article
<br>
at the beginning of the title.
<br>
<p>My point was that in ordinary English, &quot;Retreat to commitment&quot; regrettably/confusingly
<br>
can sound imperative -- &quot;Do this!&quot; Bartley did not mean this, but I think that anyone
<br>
freshly confronting the title without the &quot;the&quot; would have high odds of wondering about
<br>
it. Add to this that Bartley was _some_ sort of Christian and the fun multiplies.

<em>&gt;   Bartley fixed a bug in Popper's system. Religious people had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   responded to Popper by claiming &quot;Everyone has to have faith in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   something. You have faith in your Critical Rationalism, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   faith in the Word of God.&quot; Bartley's fix is Pan-Critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Rationalism. The fix is to subject the Critical Rationalism to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   criticism as well. The book has a very long section explaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   what Bartley thinks the best attacks on PCR would be, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   defending it against them. At the end, he concludes that PCR is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the most effective system he can find for getting better answers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to questions, and that that's the best criteria he's found for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   evaluating a way of thinking.
</em><br>
<p>Chris old chum: Is this based on the Second Edition, or the First?
<br>
I _really_ want to get my hands on the 2nd so I can judge how he refined
<br>
things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The other question Mike brought up was where the title (&quot;Retreat to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Commitment&quot;) came from.  The answer is that the first part of the book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives background for Bartley's discussion of the bug discussed above in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Popper's epistemology.  It does so by giving a history of Protestant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Episcopalian?  I don't really remember) thought.  As Mike alluded to,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historically, this particular faith believed in questioning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctrine, and discussing the implications for theology.  Eventually,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that led them into blind alleys where they couldn't justify particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs, or where they found contradictions.  According to Bartley, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caused them to gradually retreat from their questioning stance to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just another religion based on commitment to the received
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation.
</em><br>
<p>Yep yep, and I think it's a possible wedge for countering Xtian fundies.
<br>
<p>BTW, Bartley got an article into _Harper's_ in 1959 called 
<br>
&quot;I Call Myself a Protestant&quot;; I'm trying to dig that up, it 
<br>
might be fun reading.
