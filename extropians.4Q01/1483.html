<p><em>&gt;Not meaning to ignite passions more, I nevertheless think this is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good statement about the reality of Islam behind the &quot;but it's really a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion of peace&quot; talk:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     <a href="http://www.secularislam.org/call.htm">http://www.secularislam.org/call.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Every word of it is consistent with my reading on the subject.
</em><br>
<p>Warning: here comes my soapbox...
<br>
<p>Hmmm.  It seems to be quite *inconsistent* with what I have read.  I'm no 
<br>
Muslim, nor scholar of Islam.  However I am fascinated by religious belief 
<br>
and have done some reading in that area over the years.  In light of recent 
<br>
events, like many people, my interest in Islam has markedly increased.  At 
<br>
first I was looking for something to support my initial assumption that 
<br>
Islam was a religion of violence, not of peace -- like say Judaism or 
<br>
Christianity.  I have been consistently dissapointed.
<br>
<p>There are of course some suras in the Qur-an which could be interpreted as 
<br>
calling for religious intolerance and violence.  But no more so than what 
<br>
you will find in the Bible, particularly the Old Testament.  For instance if 
<br>
you examine the verses cited by the ISIS, you will see that they are not 
<br>
quite as clear-cut as they may seem at first blush.  For intance: according 
<br>
to ISIS, the Qur-an exorts Muslims to &quot;kill the disbelievers wherever we 
<br>
find them.&quot;  However, if you actually read the sura in context it admonishes 
<br>
the believers to fight against the *persecution of their faith*.  Who could 
<br>
argue with that?  2:191 does say &quot;slay them whereever ye catch them.&quot;  But 
<br>
2:192 goes on to say: &quot;But if they cease, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most 
<br>
Merciful.&quot;  2:193 says: &quot;And fight them on until there is no more 
<br>
persecution.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is certainly no worse, if no better, than what you will find in the 
<br>
Bible.  Also, the Qur-an does tell the Muslim &quot;take not Jews and Christians 
<br>
for your friends and protectors.&quot;  But this is not any worse than Old 
<br>
Testament admonitions to the Jews to separate themselves from the Gentiles.  
<br>
And it is not even as divisive or inflammatory as Jesus' own reference to 
<br>
Gentiles as &quot;dogs&quot; (Matthew 15:26).
<br>
<p>In short, I'd take what ISIS says about the teachings of Islam with a grain 
<br>
of salt.  They refer to themselves as freethinkers with &quot;Islamic roots.&quot;  
<br>
This does not mean that they are necessarily learned in the teachings of 
<br>
Islam.  To the contrary, it implies that they are &quot;cultural&quot; Muslims, like 
<br>
many in the West who live like atheists but call themselves &quot;Christian.&quot;
<br>
<p>My readings, apparently unlike yours, lead me to believe that the Qur-an 
<br>
advocates the use of violence only to protect the right of Muslims to 
<br>
practice their beliefs in freedom from persecution.  I have seen nothing 
<br>
which suggests that Islam advocates spreading the belief at the edge of the 
<br>
sword.  To the contrary I have been oft-referred to the sura which plainly 
<br>
states &quot;there is no compulsion in religion.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, please condemn the terrorists.  What they do is without any reasonable 
<br>
justification.  But be careful and study before you condemn their religion.  
<br>
I am an atheist.  I believe that *all* religions are baseless fairy-tales.  
<br>
But I have not yet found any reason to disparage Islam any more than those 
<br>
religions with which we in the west are more comfortable.
<br>
<p>Soapbox dismounted.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
