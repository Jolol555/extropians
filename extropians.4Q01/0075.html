<em>&gt; &gt;Maher is saying that purposely crashing four airplanes full of generally

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;courageous than purposely dropping cruise missiles from 2000 miles away
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;warring and mayhem in very personal in your face circumstances...

<em>&gt; You're falling into the error he was attacking - brave means brave, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good.  Bombing the WTC was very evil, but you'd have to be quite brave
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; no bravery.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that, in military tradition, seeking to die in battle is
<br>
generally foolish and cowardly. The 'heroes' who die with little
<br>
military gain but a battle cry are a waste of resources that could be
<br>
spent training someone who uses themselves in ways to benefit victory.
<br>
If such lived instead, they would generally be court martialed for the
<br>
stupid acts that kill them.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, it is indeed cowardly to shoot or otherwise kill unarmed
<br>
civilians. Dying in the act of doing so is doubly cowardly, since one
<br>
thereby avoids facing the consequences of their actions (i.e. the war
<br>
crimes trials).
<br>
<p>Flicking a switch to launch a cruise missile against a bunch of foaming
<br>
at the mouth fanatics only proves the point that 'discretion is the
<br>
better part of valor'. When fighting an enemy, you don't let him decide
<br>
on the ground and means by which you fight. You pick the time, the
<br>
ground, and the means, you do it to him first and hard. Study up on your
<br>
Sun Tsu.
