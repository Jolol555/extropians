</em><br>
<em>&gt;0.7
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Mon, 31 Dec 2001 10:23:03 -0800 (PST)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Proposed FAQ question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Since the Extropian movement is heavily invested in libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophy,  which purportedly stresses individual rights and property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rights, how do the Extropians reconcile the &quot;open borders&quot; philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advocated by Extropians, with the fact that most American citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oppose open borders (even before 911WTC numerous polls showed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 55-65% of Americans wanted less immigration, which is certainly a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way from open borders).  Seems as if Extropians would wish to trample
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the individual rights of most Americans by implementing open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; borders--not to mention taking the food out of the mouths of working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; class Americans by lowering wages with immigration...or perhaps a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weight reduction plan for the working classes is part of the Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophy  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't understand your confusion: where's the contradiction?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Libertarian politics implies open borders (or rather, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government not restrict people's movements).  The majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Americans disagree--as would be expected, since the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Americans are not libertarians.  The idea that advocating open
</em><br>
<em>&gt;borders in some way infringes the rights of those who don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe in them gets it exactly backward: it is the act of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;excluding people that is a violation of rights; if individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Americans don't want to allow immigration /on their own land/,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a libertarian government would enforce their property rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If others wanted to allow unlimited immigration on /their/
</em><br>
<em>&gt;land, a libertarian government would not interfere.  In that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way, /everyone's/ rights are protected, even the isolationists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the isolationists don't want to allow immigration to /other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people's land/, then it is they who are overstepping their power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and imposing their will on others.  It is not the business of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a libertarian government to support people who would violate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rights of others to do what they want with their own land.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--
</em><br>
<p><p>It's an overly simplistic viewpoint.  Earlier, someone posted a list of URLS 
<br>
showing libertarian viewpoints that opposed opne borders; I had not been 
<br>
aware of that faction, and found those URLS very interesting reading. My 
<br>
impression is that although the libertarian writers listed on those URLs all 
<br>
had EXCELLENT credentials (e.g., academic, etc), and at least one of them 
<br>
was arguably a &quot;founder&quot; of libertarianism, it might said that they had been 
<br>
marginalized -- or had become unfashionable -- in recent years; in fact, I 
<br>
suspect that mainstream business adopted one faction of libertarianism, and 
<br>
made that faction mainstream libertariansim and they (the libertarians who 
<br>
opposed open borders) were not in the adopted faction.
<br>
<p>Basically, my viewpoint is that there are both rights and properties that 
<br>
are *intangible*.  Our legal system very clearly recognizes this.  Anyone 
<br>
with a passing interest or familiarity with the law must agree.  Also, 
<br>
standard business doctrine and practices also recognize that there are 
<br>
*intangible* business assets. Anyone with a passing interest in business 
<br>
must agree.
<br>
<p>So, I ask, for *starters*, where is the &quot;mainstream&quot; libertarian recognition 
<br>
of the *intangible* aspects of property and rights?
