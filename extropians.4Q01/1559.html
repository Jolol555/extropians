<p><em>&gt;But where is the admission from all these people who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worshipping capitalism (please, let's be honest!) that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relatively small fraction of the population stands to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tremendously from having the population in thrall the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capitalism-worship?  I just don't see that!  And I know, just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sure as water downhill, that those dynamics exist. And likewise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I also know, with the same certainty, that there exist very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;serious conflicts of interest between those who have, and who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significantly less.  Where is the admission of this obvious fact?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Great benefits are to be had...the motivation is there...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Therefore, I protest. And I will continue to do so.
</em><br>
<p>The simple fact is that capitalism has done more good for more
<br>
people than any economic system in history.
<br>
<p>True it's not perfect, and we're still tuning it, but the simple
<br>
fact proven over and over again, is that the lowliest person
<br>
economically can raise themselves to whatever status they desire by
<br>
following it's tenets.
<br>
<p>I was born without two nickels to rub together and have managed to
<br>
attain moderate affluence by following it's simple principals.
<br>
<p>What Hernando De Soto and his many colleagues have figured out is
<br>
what appears to go wrong with those trying to adopt capitalism, and
<br>
how to correct it.
<br>
<p>The affects in the third world may be astounding.
