</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hiya Ken, good to hear from ya. Okay, prosaic explanation accepted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fact still stands that if they know who I am, I have no provable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;privacy when doing business through them. The only secret they can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;betray is one they don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.goldmoney.com/">http://www.goldmoney.com/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.egold.com/">http://www.egold.com/</a>
</em><br>
<p>The actual URL for E-Gold is <a href="http://www.e-gold.com">http://www.e-gold.com</a>.  egold.com is owned
<br>
by a squatter.
<br>
<p>According to their user agreement e-gold handles identification as follows:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.e-gold.com/unsecure/e-g-agree.htm#Limits">http://www.e-gold.com/unsecure/e-g-agree.htm#Limits</a>:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2. Value Limits
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issuer may set the value limit on the balance in an e-gold account
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on the sufficiency of the identifying information provided by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User. Issuer may restrict User?s ability to use more than one e-gold
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account in an attempt to circumvent this limit.
<br>
<p>As they explained in more detail on their mailing list as this policy
<br>
was being evolved, the idea is that an account would have limits on how
<br>
much e-gold it could hold depending on how thoroughly they owner had
<br>
been identified.  This would not stop you from spending your e-gold,
<br>
but would stop people from transferring e-gold into your account if it
<br>
would exceed the value limit.
<br>
<p>After an initial account creation, there would be a low limit.  Once an
<br>
email verification was done, the limit would be raised.  Beyond that
<br>
there could be telephone or postal mail contact, and finally a notarized
<br>
statement of identity, to get the maximum limits.  There are some e-gold
<br>
accounts holding millions of dollars.
<br>
<p>I don't know if these specific levels of identification are in use today,
<br>
and what the corresponding value limits are.  In general I think this
<br>
is a reasonable solution if the company feels the need to know who its
<br>
large customers are.  But it does mean that you can't be fully anonymous
<br>
to e-gold and use it for large scale transactions.
<br>
