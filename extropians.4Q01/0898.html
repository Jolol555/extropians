<p><em>&gt; You don't have that kind of time, and furthermore you're treating this

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it makes me non-mainstream here, but I do not believe
<br>
that technology alone will allow us to transcend our current
<br>
conditons and its many dangers.  I don't believe that a
<br>
technology-only (or mostly so) end-run is a viable or workable
<br>
alternative.  I think a lot of personal/social transformation is
<br>
also required.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Maybe I'm being too harsh here.  I guess a lot of these ideas look a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less silly if you're planning for a 50-year or, ha ha, 100-year outlook.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But try pretending, as a mental exercise, that everything you do with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life has to be completely finished by 2008 to do any good, and see what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that does to your perspective.
</em><br>
<p>You can only dance as fast as you can.  It is a worthwhile
<br>
exercise to think how you would act if the above is true and it
<br>
may even be that you will do the best you can possibly do even
<br>
if the above turns out to be false.  It helps to have as clean a
<br>
vision of what is to be acheived as possible.  Then you can
<br>
decide how much can be done in the timeframe and what the
<br>
tradeoff is between a stretched out timeframe and aspects of the
<br>
vision.
