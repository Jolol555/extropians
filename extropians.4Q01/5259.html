<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Competition due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; overcrowding exacerbates conflict, in a neighborhood, state country or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; region. One person's gain is another's loss. Given one pie--be it finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; natural resources or available full-time jobs--adding additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; consumers must be at the expense of others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Isn't this statement in contradiction to the assumption that improved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology will provide more pie - pardon, resources - for all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That assumption works well in many casses, except that historically (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictably) people use new technology (such as medicine) to extend their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives and to reduce mortality, thus adding to overpopulation. It's more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular to use technology to save lives than it is to use technology to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more and better widgets, so while greedy and selfish (according to liberals)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalists continue to develop more amazing gagetry, government and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foundation funding goes to institutions which promise to cure disease, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We could reduce the overcrowding problem by slowing human reproduction, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's still only so much real estate available on Earth. Some say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution is to colonize other planets or to live in space, while others say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extraterrestrial migration constitutes pollution of the universe. Furthermore,
</em><br>
<p>And we should actually consider this last opinion for more than
<br>
a few microseconds?  The solution will present itself quickly
<br>
enough as we migrate from being totally or mainly meat-based. 
<br>
Even in the meat biological space ZPG tends to correlate
<br>
strongly with advancing technology and more options and
<br>
interests than spawning children. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; providing more &quot;resources&quot; also means providing more opportunity for crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The industrial revolution made possible machine guns used by gangsters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That does not follow in the least.  With sufficient resources
<br>
there is no need for crime in order to survive and even
<br>
thrive.    
<br>
<p>The &quot;First Prohibition&quot; created many of the gangsters and fueled
<br>
organized crime.  The &quot;Second Prohibition&quot; allows parasitical
<br>
profiteering on locking up huge segments of the US population
<br>
and creats a lot of needless street violence and excuses to
<br>
strip away a lot of our rights.  These things can hardly be
<br>
blamed in any meaningful way on improved technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that history has shown that this is possible, but only if we use technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wisely with the profit for all in mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it may be possible, and it's more possible for people to believe this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than it is for people to accomplish it. The wise use of technology implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparable wise use of the technologists who create it, and nobody really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likes the idea of being used, wisely or otherwise. So, there will always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rogue technologists, as witness the abundance of hackers on the Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes it looks like there's more computer virus technology going around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than there is useful programming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This has no substance at all.  It is a strawman.  You posited
<br>
wise use of technologists out of whole cloth and then use it as
<br>
an arguing point.  Shame, shame.  
<br>
<p>There are &quot;hackers&quot; and there are hackers.  Hackers in the
<br>
original sense are master software and hardware people. 
<br>
&quot;Hacker&quot; in the derogatory sense is &quot;cracker&quot; someone breaking
<br>
and entering and vandalizing machines.  The government seems
<br>
bent on making a lot of what the first category, including me,
<br>
most cares about and wants to see come to pass from the
<br>
cyber-revolution, illegal and those who pursue it
<br>
&quot;cyber-terrorists&quot;.  In such an eventuality more and more of us
<br>
will be criminals according to some hair-brained rule or
<br>
another.  But it is not because we are fighting being &quot;used&quot;. 
<br>
It is because our government is standing in the way of a future
<br>
that is much more desirable and that is within our grasp if we
<br>
will to produce and claim it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The &quot;limited resources theory&quot; does not explain the higher rates of violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crimes in the US compared to countries with the same standard of living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Europe, Japan, Australia) -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO, gun ownership doesn't explain it either. America differs from Europe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Japan, and Australia in many ways, not just the American right to bear arms.
</em><br>
<p>What right is that?  In most of America there is no practical
<br>
right to bear arms.  All of the laws strip us of that right.  We
<br>
may have the &quot;right&quot; on paper but most politicians weasel out of
<br>
that even being acknowledged much less any real implementation
<br>
of it.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...and I've noticed that there are more Europeans, Japanese, and Australians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; migrating to the US than the other way 'round. So, perhaps people prefer a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain amount of violence combined with the freedom it seems to announce,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the crime-free atmosphere of places lacking other kinds of liberty. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wild West ain't the safest place in the world, but it may be the most open and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfettered. Guess that's why more folks immigrate than emigrate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The US is not remotely like the images of the Wild West. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; IMO, the ideology of limited resources we have to fight about is only good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for extremists (left or right) who prefer to steal from others, instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exploring new opportunities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And when those who produce nothing steal and lock away what you
<br>
and others like you have produced, what then?  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm all for exploring new opportunities, and for creating more resources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's why I prefer science to politics and laugh at the oxymoron &quot;political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course it's convenient to dismiss real problems and run off to explore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed opportunities somewhere else, isn't it? With overcrowding comes more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more explorers who compete for the supposed new opportunities. IMO, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology of stealing new opportunities instead of repairing and maintaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we have is only good for crackpots who deny the work that is necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for real success.
</em><br>
<p>Fortunately there are a lot more options than these.
