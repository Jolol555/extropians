<p>I've got the training that one gets as an active duty member of the Air
<br>
Force.  While it is true that the conventions say that *uniformed* POWs
<br>
are only obligated to give their name, rank, and serial number, I can
<br>
say that the US is the ONLY country ever to fully observe the
<br>
conventions (though we have made some significant classified
<br>
exceptions). Ununiformed insurgents, saboteurs, infiltrators, etc do not
<br>
fall under this treatment, nor are they considered to be spies as
<br>
covered under the US constitution. There is no Geneva convention for the
<br>
treatment of ununiformed terrorists. A terrorist, by his very actions in
<br>
operating without a uniform and targeting civilians specifically, thumbs
<br>
his nose at ideas like the Geneva Conventions, human rights, etc. Thus
<br>
they deserve none of the protections that combatants AND common
<br>
criminals both enjoy.
