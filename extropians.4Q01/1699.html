<em>&gt;&gt; So, the answer is: Everyone needs to own their own home. Then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they'll have a stake in the welfare of their communities. Big deal...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; any Real Estate Principles teacher could have told us that. Why do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you think State governments provide low interest loans (VA, graduated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mortgage, Cal-Vet, FHA, RECD, etc.) to potential home buyers? That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; right, to encourage home ownership.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Its a great deal more complex than that, you've oversimplified what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is saying. As he points out bureaucracy makes it almost impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own your own home/land/company in many countries much less use it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an economic asset. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm at least three quarters through the book.  One of de Soto's major 
<br>
points is that the poor in third world countries *do* own their own homes, 
<br>
in the same way that occurred in many places in North America and the 
<br>
nascent US through much of the 19th century.  They and their neighbors 
<br>
agree on who owns what property, and will defend the ownership against 
<br>
people with government-backed claims.  But until their ownership becomes 
<br>
registerd in a standard way (as we take for granted in the US today) you 
<br>
can't turn it into capital to invest in other things.  de Soto details the 
<br>
political struggles in the US that led to standardising forms for ownership 
<br>
and registration of property.  We've mostly forgotten how that transition 
<br>
happened, so we haven't been able to help the third world get through the 
<br>
process.
<br>
<p>de Soto gives detailed examples of countries like Peru and Egypt where the 
<br>
government realized that legitimizing the poor's ownership of property was 
<br>
important, and created bureaucracies to push it.  There's a process in 
<br>
place, and when de Soto's group followed it, to find out how it worked, 
<br>
they discovered that it could take more than a year of full time work to 
<br>
talk to all the different departments that had to sign off on it.  (Some 
<br>
great charts on this subject.)  As a result, the poor continue to live in 
<br>
and defend their &quot;illegal&quot; property, but they can't turn it into money.
<br>
<p>I think it's Egypt for which de Soto says that the poor own/control 
<br>
property worth something like one hundred times the total value of all 
<br>
foreign investment in that country over the last 100 years.  But they can't 
<br>
get a mortgage, so it's &quot;dead&quot; capital.
