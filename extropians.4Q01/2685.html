<br>
<em>&gt;I can't agree that these words/prhases are specifically alligned to any one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        professional group.
</em><br>
<p>No, it couldn't be &quot;professional&quot;. A name for a personality type
<br>
is *descriptive*, only, not aligned with a profession. And even
<br>
the &quot;artist&quot; description is not the same name used by different
<br>
enneagram teachers who describe that number four personality type.
<br>
<p>However, don't you think that there is a tendency for particular
<br>
personality types to be attractive to particular kinds of work,
<br>
or to have particular interests? Look at the extropians group
<br>
for instance. We have had many many discussions about &quot;types&quot;
<br>
here, and have discovered strong correlations (I recall correctly,
<br>
the NT axis being really strong here, if one uses the Myers
<br>
Briggs system).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The above characteristics could be attributed to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        one at any time.
</em><br>
<p>It's really hard to describe in just a paragraph or in just a
<br>
few words about a personality type in a particular typing system.
<br>
I said &quot;essence&quot; specifically because I didn't have time or motivation
<br>
to write 10 pages to do a better job to describe that one personality
<br>
type. Those few words I wrote about the type four does _not_ mean
<br>
that other personality types won't, *at times*, feel that way
<br>
or do those things either.
