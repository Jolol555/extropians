A Cat That Doesn't Need a Litter Box
<br>
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/scitech/DailyNews/Robocat011016_wire.html">http://abcnews.go.com/sections/scitech/DailyNews/Robocat011016_wire.html</a>
<br>
By Edmund Klamann
<br>
<p>Japan's biggest toymaker pioneered the world's first virtual pet, the
<br>
Tamagotchi, and the nation's most famous electronics maker rolled out the No.
<br>
1 robot dog, Aibo.
<br>
<p>Now one of its biggest makers of automated factory systems, Omron Corp, has
<br>
weighed in with a robot cat: NeCoRo.
<br>
Like most household cats, it doesn't respond to commands or perform tricks.
<br>
<p>Nor can it walk, but Omron officials said it does what is most important:
<br>
purring contentedly when stroked, and otherwise giving cuddly emotional
<br>
feedback to its owner with feline sounds and movements.
<br>
<p>&quot;Individual contact was our priority,&quot; Toshihiro Tashima, head of Omron's
<br>
e-pet project, said at the robot cat's coming-out party today.
<br>
<p>For Japanese Cat-Lovers Only
<br>
Only 5,000 of the acrylic-furred felines will be up for sale, and only in
<br>
Japan, with a retail list price of 185,000 yen ($1,530) each.
<br>
<p>That compares with 98,000 yen for the latest version of Sony Corp's Aibo pets,
<br>
which can recognize 75 simple words, take photos and mimic human intonation.
<br>
<p>When it debuted in 1999, a limited offer of 3,000 Aibos sold out over the
<br>
Internet in Japan in less than 20 minutes, commanding 250,000 yen a piece.
<br>
<p>For Japan's mechanical cat-lovers, NeCoRo, whose name derives from the
<br>
Japanese for cat, will be available at select Takashimaya department stores or
<br>
over the Internet at http//:www.necoro.com.
<br>
<p>A Petable Pelt
<br>
The robot pet has tactile sensors behind and beneath its ears and on its back,
<br>
where cats are particularly sensitive, as well as audio and visual sensors
<br>
enabling it to recognize loud noises, sudden movements or the calling of its
<br>
name.
<br>
<p>Its &quot;vocabulary&quot; includes 48 different cat noises. It can also perk up its
<br>
ears, squint its eyes, tilt its head or stretch its legs to express such
<br>
feelings as surprise or fatigue.
<br>
<p>NeCoRo's most difficult achievement, Tashima said, was the fake-fur skin that
<br>
expands and contracts with its various body movements and facial expressions.
<br>
<p>And like Bandai Co Ltd's hit Tamagotchi - a small, egg-shaped toy displaying a
<br>
virtual bird that requires virtual care and feeding - NeCoRo will develop
<br>
personality traits based on how it is treated by its owner.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you hold it a lot, it'll develop a gentle personality, but if you don't
<br>
play with it much, it'll ignore you,&quot; Tashima said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Fake Cats to Smarter ATMs
</em><br>
Omron, known for sensor technology used in products from factory tools to
<br>
automatic tellers, also hoped the artificial intelligence and other
<br>
technologies tested in NeCoRo would find applications in more practical items,
<br>
such as user-friendly vending machines for train tickets.
<br>
<p>&quot;As machines become a bit smarter, they'll be easier to use,&quot; Tashima said.
<br>
<p>Omron executives also acknowledged that NeCoRo had room for improvement,
<br>
although they disclosed no concrete plans for future generations.
<br>
<p>&quot;We'll decide on our next step depending on how the market reacts to this,&quot;
<br>
Tashima said.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
