<br>
Aerospace giant Boeing has decided that it needs to give serious thought to
<br>
cutting pilots out of the cockpit. The company has established a new
<br>
organisation dedicated to efforts in the expanding &quot;unmanned systems&quot; market
<br>
and aimed at fast-tracking the development of pilotless combat aircraft.
<br>
<p>The first focus of the Unmanned Systems group will be the US Air Force's X-45
<br>
Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV). Once this aircraft has been proved to a
<br>
sufficient degree, the division plans on developing prototypes aimed at
<br>
gathering intelligence, area surveillance and combat reconnaissance.
<br>
<p>At one time, the US military said it had no desire to allow unmanned aircraft
<br>
to carry lethal payloads. However, following tests last year with Predator
<br>
UAV's firing Hellfire anti-tank missiles, and the subsequent deployment and
<br>
success of the pairing in killing tanks in Afghanistan, the Pentagon has
<br>
warmed rapidly to the idea.
<br>
<p>As well as the sexy-looking X-45, the Boeing group will look at the
<br>
feasibility of cheap, expendable UAV's that could be sent on suicidal
<br>
missions, expensive but rugged designs that could survive nearly anything,
<br>
next-generation target drones that would give trainee pilots a real challenge,
<br>
and integrating elements of UAV control and hardware into front-line ground
<br>
units.
<br>
<p>Pilotless Payola
<br>
For the big aviation players, the unmanned concept represents a fiscal
<br>
lifeline. The finalisation of the Joint Strike Fighter model has now put an
<br>
end to any new manned fighter contracting until at least the middle of this
<br>
century. To get new pork, the corporations have to find other niches.
<br>
<p>Based in St.Louis, the new Unmanned Systems group will be headed up by Mike
<br>
Heinz and report to both Jerry Daniels, president and chief executive officer
<br>
of Boeing Military Aircraft and Missile Systems, and George Muellner,
<br>
president, Boeing Phantom Works, the company's advanced
<br>
research-and-development unit.
<br>
<p>&quot;Unmanned systems are the future of aerospace,&quot; Daniels said. &quot;We intend to
<br>
lead the transformation they will bring by leveraging the best from across
<br>
Boeing. That's what Mike's organization will do.&quot;
<br>
<p>The unmanned systems organization will oversee current Boeing projects
<br>
including the two Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle programs sponsored by the U.S.
<br>
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - one for the U.S. Air Force, the
<br>
other for the U.S. Navy. Boeing is also pursuing an unmanned concept based on
<br>
canard rotor wing technology.
<br>
<p>Expect to see the aircraft appearing in a Tom Clancy novel some time soon!

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
