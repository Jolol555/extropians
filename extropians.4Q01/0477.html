</em><br>
<p>Yes. The factory in Sudan was blown up late at night to minimize casualties.
<br>
It was blown up because it was believed to be manufacturing biological weapons.
<br>
Now it is possible they were wrong about that, perhaps the murderous power
<br>
hungry thugs who run Sudan decided to build a  baby food factory instead,
<br>
perhaps they decided to ring the baby food factory with barbed wire, security
<br>
check points, and anti aircraft guns just for the hell of it.  But to put the blowing
<br>
up of this place in even the same ethical universe as crashing two civilian
<br>
airliners into the World Trade Center is yet another example of poor
<br>
Mr.Chomsky's moral tone deafness handicap.
<br>
<p>By the way, if Churchill had decided that he would take no action if there was a
<br>
chance, any chance at all, of a single innocent person being hurt we would all be
<br>
saluting a swastika today
<br>
<p><em>      &gt;how can you describe him as &quot;consumed by hate&quot;???
</em><br>
<p>You are not playing straight with me, your mock surprise does not ring true.
<br>
I do not believe anybody is surprised that some think Chomsky is not a very
<br>
nice man. I do not believe anybody can read:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This has nothing to do even with revenge. It is at a far lower moral level even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than that&quot;
<br>
realize that he is NOT referring to the attack on September 11 but to the muted
<br>
response of the civilized word SINCE  then to protect themselves from more
<br>
murders by barbarians, and not conclude that hate has distorted poor
<br>
Mr. Chomsky's logical thought process.
