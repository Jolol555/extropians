<p>
I was recently loaned 2 books by my brother, straight-A wiz kid. &quot;The GIZA
<br>
POWER PLANT&quot; and &quot;The Mars Mystery&quot;. I tried. He's my brother and I tried
<br>
hard to get through them. I ended up writing...purging's a better word...to
<br>
him my feelings about the genre, which I thought I'd show, you as it cheered
<br>
me up a lot. Feel free to use it.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------
<br>
Hi Bro, again,
<br>
<p>I'm writing this stuff down as I'm compiling stuff for an essay on
<br>
rationality. I don't want to lose it (what I write down, not my rationality!
<br>
have I got it anyway...hmmm).
<br>
<p>Well 'The Mars Mystery' did it to me again. I ended up skim reading the
<br>
whole thing enough to pick out the usual structure of the genre:
<br>
<p>The honours graduate of the &quot;Von Daniken School of Unclear Thinking and
<br>
Deception&quot; will master the following genre:
<br>
<p>1) Rattle off real historical facts with real evidence for a while.
<br>
2) Intersperse it with faintest hints something big coming up and possibly
<br>
actual conjecture about &lt;insert mystery of choice&gt;
<br>
3) Go into great depth on the author's experience and expertise, how much
<br>
more sensible it is for me, the author, to know about these things and have
<br>
the 'correct perspective'.
<br>
4) Put little pointers(a) to bibliographies(b) that make the target
<br>
reader(c) think they are participating in a work of science with backup,
<br>
that they know no-one but skeptics(d)  will ever follow up but they don't
<br>
care. It looks good if you allude to an obvious trail of evidence(e) that
<br>
you didn't have time to follow up - this saves a lot of work. Let the reader
<br>
follow up if interested via (f).
<br>
5) Photos. As many as possible. Hand drawn artwork versions of those key but
<br>
elusive mysteries, the reader in all likelihood won't read the caption that
<br>
says 'artwork'.
<br>
6) Diagrams. Do a few diagrams with symbols and high school maths that look
<br>
plausible and mysterious and scientific.
<br>
7) Put a little more meat on the conjecture and then back off a bit, adding
<br>
real events that appear to lend weight to the conjecture. It helps to put in
<br>
little hints about being ignored in spite of obvious prowess and mastery of
<br>
the subject...this gets the sympathy element of the hard-done by readership
<br>
going along with you.
<br>
8) Links. It is very helpful to link your mystery to other mysteries. Many
<br>
readers have been through the other mysteries and this will lend credence to
<br>
your authority.
<br>
9) Intersperse this section with allusions to conspiracies and cover-ups
<br>
that conveniently put key evidence just that little bit out of reach. Polish
<br>
it with questions like &quot;Did the &lt;mysterious thing &gt; do this/that or the
<br>
other&quot;,  &quot;What if the &lt;mysterious thing&gt; did...&quot;.
<br>
10) WHAM. Hit 'em with the conjecture as a story of fact.
<br>
11) Postulate more future conjectures assuming the WHAMMY is real.
<br>
12) Post-Game mop up with philosophical sounding inspirations, rounding off
<br>
a hard won fight with the forces of ignorance, welcoming you the tribe of
<br>
true believers, leaving you feel like you've been sated, you were right all
<br>
along. Not only that, if you don't believe you're in for trouble of some
<br>
sort.
<br>
13) Long list of bibliographies to no-where along with an optional index in
<br>
case you need to look up that key gem to quote at the book launch.
<br>
<p>POST SCRIPTS
<br>
1) It really helps as an author if you are as deluded as you want your
<br>
readership to be. It sounds more convincing.
<br>
2) If you want to do a PhD you can stay on at V.D.S.U.T.D. and do Cult
<br>
Leader Ship. This is where you do the above, but in person. Only the
<br>
psychologically damaged need apply.
<br>
3) Timing. Any allegations made about future events must occur within the
<br>
lifetimes of the readership and suit the author's need for income.
<br>
4) Sequels. Wherever possible leave enough gaping holes for a second or 3rd
<br>
follow-up novel.
<br>
5) Be strong. Your book will, if it ever ends up in a library, be on the
<br>
fiction shelves.
<br>
6) Controversy. Ensure that your work or the subject matter ends up being
<br>
scrutinsed by skeptics associations. They are a good source of promotional
<br>
work as they have a lot of interface to the public at large.
<br>
7) WEB SITE. Mandatory but make it all links and with automated email or you
<br>
'll end up working for a living. Better to start of an automated discussion
<br>
group and let the readership pump each other up. Put a personal/proxy
<br>
appearance in from time to time to make them feel like they're part of
<br>
something special.
<br>
<p>There. I feel better now.
<br>
I think I'll stick to real sci fi. At least it's honest.
<br>
It may not seem like it, but I'm actually trying to be helpful.
<br>
;-)
