<br>
<p>Sure.  But I choose differently as is my right.  And I expect
<br>
not to be discriminated against in employment and housing simply
<br>
because I do not choose to have my brain scanned or my property
<br>
and affairs examined in minute detail.
<br>
<p>#### You are using the word &quot;to discriminate against&quot;. As far as I can tell,
<br>
it means &quot;to make reprehensible choices regarding other people, usually
<br>
resulting in unjust harm to those persons&quot;. It is an expression of an
<br>
attitude, not the description of an objective finding. Now, if you say that
<br>
my choice not to employ as babysitter a person who refuses to provide
<br>
adequate references, is in fact &quot;discrimination&quot;, you are condemning my
<br>
behavior, and probably setting the stage for a forceful intervention on
<br>
behalf of the &quot;discriminated&quot; person.
<br>
<p>What is the moral axiom on which you are in this case basing your
<br>
expectation &quot;not to be discriminated against&quot;? If you can provide such a
<br>
rule, it turns out to be a rule I share with you, and your reasoning from
<br>
that rule to a ban on the use of threat recognition testing(TRT) in the
<br>
hiring of babysitters is logically correct, then I will of course accept
<br>
your point of view.
<br>
<p>But, if you merely express an indignation with TRT, I would disregard it and
<br>
still not hire the untested stranger. And, if you bring the government goons
<br>
to prevent me from acting out my choice, I would have to conclude that you
<br>
are using a double standard, allowing yourself to &quot;choose differently as is
<br>
my right&quot; but preventing my own noncoercive, non-monopolistic choices simply
<br>
because you choose to do so.
