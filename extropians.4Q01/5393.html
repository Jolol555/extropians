</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago,  and Europe, many thousands of years ago).
</em><br>
<p><p>Remember, your model is basically that people noncoercively get a

society they would not like -- or most members would not like and that
<br>
pretty much amounts to a form of oligarchy. 
<br>
<p>### You summarized my position very well.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Is your arguments that each
<br>
step of the way, hunter-gatherers moved noncoercively to agriculture and
<br>
then to government and then to empire and so forth?
<br>
<p>### The first steps were noncoercive, then there was non-government
<br>
coercion, then an organized response to it, then a slippery slope of more
<br>
coercion and more government, from which we started to emerge only a few
<br>
hundred years ago.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>And do you also think this means government is okay?
<br>
<p>### I am merely saying that the government is not by definition evil (this
<br>
is a moral statement). As a factual statement, the emergence of the
<br>
government is essentially unavoidable, except in certain limited conditions
<br>
we discussed before.
<br>
<p>Sometimes, to a limited extent, gov't is OK, even if freedom is abridged in
<br>
some minimal way.
<br>
<p>----- 
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But with no money and no land, your voluntary activities are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited. Why should the landowners allow competition if they can get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away with suppressing it? Their situation is not an argument against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government per se, but against government as it is now. No surprise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; armed uprisings occur so frequently.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, but what's your point?  Is it that a free market causes this
<br>
phenomena because it's being surpressed?  If so, this is a highly
<br>
unusual attack on free markets.
<br>
<p>### I started a discussion with you a long time ago about the need to
<br>
control the size of economic entities to protect the free market. We didn't
<br>
finish because I got too busy at work, but basically I was saying that the
<br>
free market destroys itself if not controlled. This is the same point I am
<br>
making in our present discussion, although I focus my attention on a special
<br>
type of market, where I think I can illustrate my ideas better than before.
<br>
And I do believe that the free market is the morally and economically
<br>
superior way of social interaction, so my argument is not against, but *for*
<br>
the market (and the government needed to serve it).
<br>
<p>------- 
<br>
<p>If instead, you mean those big Latin American landowners got their land
<br>
through a free market, then surpressed it, then this is actually wrong.
<br>
<p>### Oh, well, the beginning was different in Colombia and my model, but I
<br>
outlined a way for both of them ending in the same spot, and I gave
<br>
historical examples of spontaneous land accumulation (not by direct state
<br>
fiat).
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>Also, what do think the solution is to the problem de Soto has outlined?
<br>
More government controls, less freedom, less capitalism?  Or his
<br>
solution: recognize the property titles, loosen controls, and allow
<br>
people to carry out these informal transactions openly without fear of
<br>
persecution?  If you opt for the former solution, then you'll just
<br>
repeat every wave of reform in the Latin America, which only leads to a
<br>
new ruling clique and the need for another wave of reforms in a
<br>
generation.  If you opt for the latter, these people can get on with
<br>
their lives and unlocking their economic potential will help even First
<br>
Worlders.
<br>
<p>### I am all for de Soto. By now you might see I am not pro-government, even
<br>
though I claim it's something you can't live without (barring new
<br>
technological developments).
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Only revolutions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; technical developments break such states, forcing some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; redistribution of inherited wealth, as opposed to earned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Not exactly true.  Social changes apart from technology often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; play a big role -- and technology is only one factor among many.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Let's no reify it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not exactly, but *mostly* true (or else - can you substantiate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that, historically, non-technology driven, voluntary activities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; led to the decline of most feudal states?)
</em><br>
<p>Yeap.  The fact that the three separate military challenges -- the
<br>
Norse, the Hungarians, and the Moslems -- to Western Europe stopped by
<br>
about 1100 AD (the Hungarians much earlier, the Moslems much later;
<br>
source Ernst Bloch's _Feudal Society_ Vol. 1) allowed villages and such
<br>
to start trading again and for culture to spread without fear of raids
<br>
and the like.  This allowed the rise of cities and the division of labor
<br>
and knowledge on which future advances would be made.
<br>
<p>### Yes, reduced outside military pressure (thanks to government-organized
<br>
defence) will reduce the need for defence and the government (that's why bad
<br>
governments are always trying to manufacture some external bugbears to keep
<br>
themselves in business).
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>Note: I'm not saying technology played no role, but just that it's not
<br>
the whole shebang.  Also, I did not write &quot;voluntary activities,&quot; but
<br>
&quot;[s]ocial changes apart from technology...&quot;
<br>
<p>Another example, from before the Middle Ages.  The barbarians that
<br>
conquered Rome were not technologically superior to the Romans.  In
<br>
fact, it was Roman decline that led to barbarian advance.  You have to
<br>
ask why Rome declined.  Did technology do it in?  I suspect not.  Yet
<br>
its decline led to redistribution of wealth.
<br>
<p>### Yes, OK, I agree that states and nations change not only thanks to
<br>
technology - but very, very slowly.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>But you did not adopt some libertarian standard here.  You said you are
<br>
&quot;in favor of the inherited wealth redistribution but largely against
<br>
redistribution of earned wealth.&quot;  What are the limits of inheritence by
<br>
your lights and why do you differ this from earned wealth?  
<br>
<p>### Inherited wealth comes for free - it's beneficiary didn't have to offer
<br>
something to others to gain it (like his father who ran his farm better than
<br>
the competition and thus produced cheaper food). It gives no incentive for
<br>
work, for change and innovation. And, if the concentration of wealth reaches
<br>
a high level, the free market is destroyed. So you need to limit inheritance
<br>
to some level, e.g. allowing only transfer of no more than +1 (or +2,
<br>
whichever works better) standard deviations more than the average net worth.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
After all,
<br>
even in your model, someone could, theoretically, earn the whole
<br>
planet's land. 
<br>
<p>### In that case I would try to stop him (I am only &quot;largely&quot; against earned
<br>
wealth redistribution).
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What are the limits you place on redistribution
<br>
generally and why?  I mean why place limits?  Why not either have no
<br>
redistribution or arbitrary redistribution?  By what method do you
<br>
decide?  (Do you realize too that redistribution by a third party -- a
<br>
government -- will lead to distortions and to people wanting to capture
<br>
governmental power to benefit themselves or hurt their rivals through
<br>
redistribution?)
<br>
<p>### You ask some very important questions here, striking at the heart of
<br>
what is important. I notice that you tend to look at it in a black-and-white
<br>
way - either no redistribution at all (absolutely good), or only total
<br>
redistributin (absolutely bad). I see also shades of gray, an optimum in
<br>
between. But this is a subject for a long post. Later.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So what is better - a feudal system, or a democracy (on average)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What percentage of young men in a mature democracy are killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in wars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started by the democracy, as compared to kill ratios in feudal or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slave states, and the ungoverned tribal societies?
</em><br>
<p>It would be much higher than kill ratios for modern democratic states
<br>
(and I include all the spawns of democracy in this).
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>### Sorry I don't believe it. On a per capita basis, and controlling for
<br>
technological differences and population density, popular democracies are
<br>
least kill happy. And total war was common throughout history.
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't think this will be the outcome for the above state reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This scenario has never played itself out without coercion involved
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; every step.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It did again and again - with coercion spontaneously developing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the main modality for social control, only much later mellowing to the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; level of modern US.
</em><br>
<p>Coercion, especially government coercion was involved in the modern US.
<br>
Give other examples, don't just assert.
<br>
<p>### Pre-Hispanic South American cultures - initially just groups of free
<br>
hunter-gatherers, became settled farmers, and spontaneously developed
<br>
states. It is a self-catalyzing reaction - just a little bit of coercion, a
<br>
family scuffle, catalyzes more and more violence, and at some point results
<br>
in the formation of a state.
<br>
<p>Polynesians. Ancient Egyptians. Everybody.
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Note also what you're implying: we need to give up freedom to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only truly socially free man would be a lonely man. As with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investing money, so it is with freedom that you have to prudently give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away some, to get more in return. With the emphasis on &quot;prudently&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Who decides what's prudent?
<br>
<p>### E.g a group of randomly selected adults with high IQ, replaced every
<br>
couple years by another group, who have to vote on everything again.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you know?
<br>
<p>### I don't.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if you give
<br>
up too much? 
<br>
<p>### You are screwed.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Why not allow people to decide what to do voluntarily?
<br>
<p>### Because they end up giving up or losing their freedom anyway.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>How would you impose your views?
<br>
<p>### I would build an army out of stout like-minded fellows, and just wait
<br>
until some rich, undefended folks get attacked by brigands. Soon I would be
<br>
freely elected to be the king (this would be the price for beating the
<br>
brigands). No coercion on my part, except against the bad guys.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p><p>Inside the confines of your model, but only with your unrealistic
<br>
assumptions.  For example, a tax on land would make it easier for the
<br>
biggest owners to pay, but not for more marginal ones.
<br>
<p>### Didn't I say &quot;progressive land taxation&quot;? To support the little guy and
<br>
control the big ones?
<br>
-------
<br>
<p>If you offer the tax would only be on the big guys -- or on farms over a
<br>
certain size -- then you prevent the potential for economies of scale to
<br>
be tested as they arise.  In effect, you make for less social wealth
<br>
production, hurting the whole society.  (What are the huge farms going
<br>
to do with their land, btw?  Look at it?  They'll have to grow and sell
<br>
or they won't be able to sustain themselves or continue the expansion
<br>
you assume.)
<br>
<p>### A valid objection. Adjusting the tax brackets to prevent very large
<br>
estates from forming (the ones that stifle competition) but not stopping
<br>
small and intermediate ones would be needed. You might monitor the total
<br>
agricultural output, and adjust taxes to maximize it. 
<br>
<p>This has to be done empirically.
<br>
<p><pre>
---
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<p> (Once people find
they can vote to get what they want, rather than work for it, what do
you think will happen?  Well, just what has happened!)
<p>### It is a valid point against democracy. I support demarchy, although even
a democracy is better than the feudal system, or anarchy. In general, voting
for too much freebies tends to bite back quickly and the electorate learns
well.
<p>---- 
<p>&gt;&gt; But you haven't shown why this wouldn't happen spontaneously.  After
&gt;&gt; all, most people want better choices and those who can give them to
&gt;&gt; them often make a nice profit.  Why would not this dynamic provide?
&gt;
&gt; Why, you haven't described in detail (and with historical examples)
&gt; how the spontaneous process would happen.
<p>Simple.  Have a free market in your model.  If people have varying
tastes, resources, and talents, then people will compete to provide each
other with goods and services.  Since those who succeed are rewarded and
those who fail are not, resources move into hands better able to use
them -- the innovators, the competent, and so on.  If members of the
later group become lax, resources move into more able hands -- i.e.,
there's no standing still if you want to be on top or stay in business.
<p>This is exactly how markets have progressed in reality.
<p>### You are preaching to the choir here. Except that the context of your
(quoted) remark and my question is different - I was pointing out a case
where a spontaneous process either is ineffective, or results in the
development of a coercive state, proving my point.
<p>------
<p><p>Also, science moves by basically the same model -- individuals
spontaneously come up with new theories, experiments, and the like.
Others decide if they want to accept them.  There is no command economy
like socialism in scientific progress.  Nor is there any democracy.  You
don't vote on whether Einstein's STR or GTR was right or wrong.  (In
fact, those who believe STR or GTR wrong have their venues and continue
to write, speak, debate, publish, etc.  There's no need for suppression
of even wrong ideas.)  Imagine if science were done by vote instead of
the free acceptance or rejection of ideas.  If ideas and even research
programs were a matter of voting, I think science would come to a
screaching halt and Eleizer would have to forget about his work -- or
campaign for it and hope he can get a majority to agree.
<p>### That's why science works. I wish ethics and politic had the same
guidance from empirical data which keeps the physical sciences on track.
Then we wouldn't have to bash each other with impeacheable details of
history.
<p>-----
<p>And there is one guarantee
&gt; against the jackbooted gov't thugs - a smart and ethical citizenry.
<p>I submit if you have such a citizenry, you don't need a government.
<p>### If absolutely all (or at least 95%) of the citizens were smart and
saintly, indeed, there would be no need for the government and its coercion.
Reality is different though, wouldn't you say?
<p>-----
<p>Also, absent such a citizenry, how do you prevent the unethical and the
stupid from becoming part of or supporting the government?  It would
seem like you are on the horns of a dilemma here.
<p>### You can't make silk purse out of a sow's ear. If the majority is stupid,
nothing will work, whether anarchy, socialism, or capitalism. 
<p>Luckily, there are enough good men (and women) to allow some rather nice
societies to form.
<p>------
<p><p>&gt; The only basis for coercion is the need to protect innocent life-wish,
&gt; protect truth, and protect freedom - all of these are code phrases for
&gt; very complex memes, which I would be happy to discuss, if you wish.
<p>Fire away!
<p>### Tomorrow.
