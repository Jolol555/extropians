Author, '60s icon Kesey dies
<br>
Wrote 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'
<br>

<br>
GRANTS PASS, Ore. - Ken Kesey, whose LSD-fueled bus ride became a symbol of
<br>
the psychedelic 1960s after he won fame as a novelist with ``One Flew Over the
<br>
Cuckoo's Nest,'' died Saturday morning. He was 66.
<br>
<p>Kesey died at Sacred Heart Medical Center in Eugene, two weeks after cancer
<br>
surgery to remove 40 percent of his liver.
<br>
<p>``He's gone too soon and he will leave a big gap. Always the leader, now he
<br>
leads the way again,'' said Ken Babbs, a longtime friend.
<br>
<p>After studying writing at Stanford University, Kesey burst onto the literary
<br>
scene in 1962 with ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' followed quickly with
<br>
``Sometimes a Great Notion'' in 1964, then went 28 years before publishing his
<br>
third major novel.
<br>
<p>In 1964, he rode across the country in an old school bus named Furthur driven
<br>
by Neal Cassady, hero of Jack Kerouac's beat generation classic, ``On The
<br>
Road.''
<br>
<p>The bus was filled with pals who called themselves the Merry Pranksters and
<br>
sought enlightenment through the psychedelic drug LSD. The odyssey was
<br>
immortalized in Tom Wolfe's 1968 account, ``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.''
<br>
<p>``Anyone trying to get a handle on our times had better read Kesey,'' Charles
<br>
Bowden wrote when the Los Angeles Times honored Kesey's lifetime of work with
<br>
the Robert Kirsh Award in 1991. ``And unless we get lucky and things change,
<br>
they're going to have to read him a century from now too.''
<br>
<p>``Sometimes a Great Notion,'' widely considered Kesey's greatest book, told
<br>
the saga of the Stamper clan, rugged independent loggers carving a living out
<br>
of the Oregon woods under the motto, ``Never Give A Inch.'' It was made into a
<br>
movie starring Henry Fonda and Paul Newman.
<br>
<p>But ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' became much more widely known, thanks
<br>
to a movie that Kesey hated. It tells the story of R.P. McMurphy, who feigned
<br>
insanity to get off a prison farm, only to be lobotomized when he threatened
<br>
the authority of the mental hospital.
<br>
<p>The 1974 movie swept the Academy Awards for best picture, best director, best
<br>
actor and best actress, but Kesey sued the producers because it took the
<br>
viewpoint away from the character of the schizophrenic Indian, Chief Bromden.
<br>
<p>Kesey based the story on experiences working at the Veterans Administration
<br>
hospital in Palo Alto, Calif., while attending Wallace Stegner's writing
<br>
seminar at Stanford. Kesey also volunteered for experiments with LSD.
<br>
<p>While Kesey continued to write a variety of short autobiographical fiction,
<br>
magazine articles and children's books, he didn't produce another major novel
<br>
until ``Sailor Song'' in 1992, his long-awaited Alaska book, which he
<br>
described as a story of ``love at the end of the world.''
<br>
<p>``This is a real old-fashioned form,'' he said of the novel. ``But it is sort
<br>
of the Vatican of the art. Every once in a while you've got to go get a
<br>
blessing from the pope.''
<br>
<p>Kesey considered pranks part of his art, and in 1990 took a poke at the
<br>
Smithsonian Institution by announcing he would drive his old psychedelic bus
<br>
to Washington, D.C., to give it to the nation. The museum recognized the bus
<br>
as a new one, with no particular history, and rejected the gift.
<br>
<p>In a 1990 interview with The Associated Press, Kesey said it had become harder
<br>
to write since he became famous.
<br>
<p>``When I was working on `Sometimes a Great Notion,' one of the reasons I could
<br>
do it was because I was unknown,'' he said. ``I could get all those balls in
<br>
the air and keep them up there and nothing would come along and distract me.
<br>
Now there's a lot of stuff happens that happens because I'm famous. And famous
<br>
isn't good for a writer. You don't observe well when you're being observed.''
<br>
<p>A graduate of the University of Oregon, Kesey returned to his alma mater in
<br>
1990 to teach novel writing. With each student assigned a character and
<br>
writing under the gun, the class produced ``Caverns,'' under the pen name OU
<br>
Levon, or UO Novel spelled backward.
<br>
<p>``The life of it comes from making people believe that these people are
<br>
drawing breath and standing up, casting shadows, and living lives and feeling
<br>
agonies,'' Kesey said then. ``And that's a trick. It's a glorious trick. And
<br>
it's a trick that you can be taught. It's not something, just a thing that
<br>
comes from the muses.''
<br>
<p>Among his proudest achievements was seeing ``Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets
<br>
Big Double the Bear,'' which he wrote from an Ozark mountains tale told by his
<br>
grandmother, included on the 1991 Library of Congress list of suggested
<br>
children's books.
<br>
<p>``I'm up there with Dr. Seuss,'' he crowed.
<br>
<p>Fond of performing, Kesey sometimes recited the piece in top hat and tails
<br>
accompanied by an orchestra, throwing a shawl over his head while assuming the
<br>
character of his grandmother reciting the nursery rhyme, ``One Flew Over the
<br>
Cuckoo's Nest.''
<br>
<p>Other works include ``Kesey's Garage Sale'' and ``Demon Box,'' collections of
<br>
essays and short stories, and ``Further Inquiry,'' another look at the 1964
<br>
bus trip in which the soul of Cassidy is put on trial. ``The Sea Lion'' was
<br>
another children's book, telling the story of a crippled boy who saves his
<br>
Northwest Indian tribe from an evil spirit by invoking the gift-giving
<br>
ceremony of potlatch.
<br>
<p>Born in La Junta, Colo., on Sept. 17, 1935, Kesey moved as a young boy in 1943
<br>
from the dry prairie to his grandparents' dairy farm in Oregon's lush
<br>
Willamette Valley. He earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from the
<br>
University of Oregon, where he also was a wrestler.
<br>
<p>After serving four months in jail for a marijuana bust in California, he set
<br>
down roots in Pleasant Hill in 1965 with his high school sweetheart, Faye, and
<br>
reared four children. Their rambling red barn house with the big Pennsylvania
<br>
Dutch star on the side became a landmark of the psychedelic era, attracting
<br>
visits from myriad strangers in tie-dyed clothing seeking enlightenment.
<br>
<p>The bus Furthur rusted away in a boggy pasture while Kesey raised beef cattle.
<br>
<p>Kesey was diagnosed with diabetes in 1992.
<br>
<p>His son Jed, killed in a 1984 van wreck on a road trip with the University of
<br>
Oregon wrestling team, was buried in the back yard.
