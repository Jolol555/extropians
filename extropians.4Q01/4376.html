<em>&gt;Right or wrong, the war will be over in a few days.

<p>No Spike, the 'war on terrorism' will not be over in a few days.
<br>
This is what I find so chilling about the U.S. government's policy
<br>
and words and actions of people there I listened to the last weeks.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, the American's response has reached beyond vengeance
<br>
into the realm of paranoia. The U.S. government only has to label
<br>
one as 'terrorist' and it's all over for that person. What is the
<br>
definition of 'terrorist' or 'terrorist  network'? Who defines
<br>
'terrorism'? Is carrying a U.S. passport a license to exclude the
<br>
other humans on this planet? What is this 'war'? Is the 'war on
<br>
terrorism' a new way the U.S. government has cooked up to remove as
<br>
many of our rights as possible? Once the U.S. pushes their policy,
<br>
the other governments follow suit. How many of your/our rights have
<br>
we lost in the last couple of months?
<br>
<p>I see many U.S. people willingly hand over their civil rights to the
<br>
U.S. government. Once you give 'a little', then certainly they'll
<br>
take more (Se le dai la mano, si prende tutto il braccio&quot;: if you
<br>
give her a hand, she takes all the arm). How can a compromise be
<br>
possible on such basic principles? How is it possible that the
<br>
free-est country on Earth can compromise on such basic principles?
<br>
<p>I find myself in a distressing position of not having enough reasons
<br>
to return 'home' to live. The U.S.looks to me like a very unfree
<br>
place to live now.
