I would say it makes sense to grant rights to entities based on their
<br>
ability to understand and demand these rights. This is seen in the
<br>
development of rights during childhood: first comes the right to life,
<br>
later the right of ownership and eventually the whole set of social
<br>
rights such as the right to vote. Currently this is largely handled by a
<br>
timing system where you get certain rights at certain ages, but in
<br>
principle this could instead be done by having some form of test for
<br>
each right - you gain the right to vote when you fully understand it,
<br>
you gain the right to formally own when you show you can manage your
<br>
economy and so on. 
<br>
<p>Possible transhuman and posthuman rights like the right to modify one's
<br>
brain freely might also be granted in this way. Especially rights to
<br>
activities that are incomprehensible to ordinary humans are only granted
<br>
once the being can demonstrate comprehension of them.

<p>The problem with this is that irrationality does not necessarily
<br>
encompass all aspects of a mind. I know several people I consider deeply
<br>
irrational in some respects, while entirely rational in others. Such an
<br>
individual might make bad decisions in certain situations (and hence
<br>
should not be granted some rights) but in other respects they are
<br>
rational and should have other rights. I don't see how irrational
<br>
behavior automatically disqualifies you from humanhood in an ethical
<br>
sense. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What constitutes &quot;human rights&quot;?  Since genetically our taxonomic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cladistic, genetic similarities are   so striking to other species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as chimpanzees and esp. the Bonobo chimps, I think that human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights must be defined cognitively by rational behavior.  The issue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;animal rights&quot; only reaches a threshold in rare cases such as that of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chimpanzees and dolphins possibly whales that show signs of intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organized behavior and maybe even a sense of ethics.  No other  animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have any right to exist except at our human, transhuman or posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasure.  This is also found in the concept of sentience as found in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many thoughtful science fiction and in notions such as the Prime 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Directive of Star Trek.
</em><br>
<p>It might be worth considering ethical subjecthood: can an entity decide
<br>
to change its behavior purely from a mental conclusion? 
<br>
<p>Sentience is a tricky concept to use, since it is tied to wague notions
<br>
of consciousness. Many ethicists think that beings able to experience
<br>
pain have a right not to be hurt, but it is not obvious to me why that
<br>
particular experience has any special ethical importance (why not the
<br>
ability to experience pleasure?). Being able to reflect on the
<br>
experience might be another threshold of ethical relevance. But I don't
<br>
like to base ethics on what is, in the end, a particular biological
<br>
solution to the problem of maximizing fitness. Humans with no pain
<br>
sensitivity and AIs with no bodies should after all have rights. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This background explains why terrorists need not be actively dehumanized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they have done that themselves.  It is also why their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extermination is no worse than killing a rabid dog in the streets of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; city.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with this conclusion. As I have pointed out, dehumanization
<br>
can be partial, and may not stretch all the way to losing the right to
<br>
live.
