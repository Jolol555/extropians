It really doesn't look like a lone crazy domestic biology student. According to
<br>
today's New York Times and contrary to other reports the Anthrax was
<br>
extremely sophisticated and capable of widespread damage. Not only was the
<br>
particle size very small, uniform and lacking in impurities but more important it
<br>
was treated to reduce its electrostatic charge that would tend to make it clump
<br>
together. This would also explain how one sealed letter could infect so many people.
<br>
Only 3 places on Earth are known to have the expertise to do this, the USA, the
<br>
former Soviet Union, and Iraq. Three world class experts on germ warfare told the
<br>
newspaper that government statements playing down the powder's potency came
<br>
from ignorance or an impulse to calm the public's nerves.
<br>
<p>Microbiologist William C Patrick who once made bio weapons for the USA said
<br>
&quot; It's remarkably free of extraneous material, it's electrostatic free, and its in
<br>
high concentration.&quot; He called reports that the Anthrax was of poor quality
<br>
&quot;nonsense&quot;. He said &quot;The only difference between this and weapons grade is
<br>
the size of the production.&quot;
<br>
<p>Microbiologist Richard Spertzel who inspected for biological weapons for the
<br>
UN in Iraq said  &quot; there's no question this is weapons quality, it has all the
<br>
characteristics, fine particles and readily dispersible&quot;.
<br>
<p>Al Zelicoff a physician at the Sandia National Laboratory said &quot;These people know
<br>
what they're doing, I'm truly worried they have the keys to the kingdom.&quot;
