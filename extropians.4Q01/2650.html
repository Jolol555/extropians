Cities are easy to take, given overwhelming military superiority.  This
<br>
was known at at the beginning.  None of the difficulty in dealing with
<br>
Afghanistan was expected to consist of difficulty in capturing Kabul. 
<br>
Nothing has changed.  The media is trumpeting these easy milestones
<br>
because it's what's available in the way of news.  Someone with a more
<br>
conspiratorial outlook might say that it's the media trumpeting a few easy
<br>
and expected victories in an effort to make as much capital as possible
<br>
off the few victories that are expected; to shore up support for the much
<br>
more difficult efforts that are expected to follow.  One can distinguish
<br>
between the two hypotheses by watching to see if minor setbacks are blown
<br>
equally out of proportion.  I expect it's a mixture of both causes.
