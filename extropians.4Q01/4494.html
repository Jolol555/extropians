<p>Robert, my dear pal and benefactor--I think I'd have to counsel you against
<br>
making placing such revelations on the net. They'll come back to bite you
<br>
(and maybe the rest of us, by contagion) on the ass.
<br>
<p>I think it was Eric who mentioned that Dr Allan Snyder is also autistic. Cf.:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.centreforthemind.com/newsmedia/whatshot/">http://www.centreforthemind.com/newsmedia/whatshot/</a>
<br>
<p>I haven't seen any statement from the brilliant Dr Snyder that this is so,
<br>
but it certainly explains some of his more... unusual... behavior at a
<br>
public dinner I attended a while back. He introduces himself, especially to
<br>
attractive women, by mentioning as swiftly and insistently as possible that
<br>
he's a Fellow of the Royal Society of London (an unusual distinction, it's
<br>
true, for an American.) His persona is egregiously self-promoting, and his
<br>
Centre for the Mind in Australia frequently emits brazen promotional emails
<br>
to anyone they regard as interested parties, detailing his latest triumphs,
<br>
TV appearances, etc. If he is indeed autistic (which seems not quite right,
<br>
since he buttonholes people rather than avoiding their gaze), this might
<br>
help explain his social gaucheness. Would he wish this purported fact
<br>
trumpeted about him? Maybe--he's not shy about acting it out, I suppose.
<br>
<p>But I think that announcing one's autism or Aspergerish nature might prove,
<br>
at least in the short term, the social equivalent of confessing to being a
<br>
kleptomaniac or a compulsive womanizer. The public might tend thereafter to
<br>
disregard one's utterances, however unfairly (especially if they involve
<br>
plans to tear down the solar system for spare parts).
<br>
<p>FWIW.
<br>
