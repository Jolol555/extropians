<p><em>    &gt; Let us suppose that John's claim [ medical ethicist] about their
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; level of virtue is correct.
</em><br>
<p>Let's be clear as to what I said, I didn't say they were low down dirty dogs just
<br>
one notch above pond scum, and if you ask me if I thought it I'll take the fifth.
<br>
I did said the evidence that medical ethicist were significantly more moral than
<br>
me was less than compelling. Prove me wrong, sing to me of their heroic rectitude
<br>
or of my diabolical vice.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;How  does this provide evidential support for believing that everything they say
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; can be put into one of either two categories?
</em><br>
<p>Prove me wrong, show me something a medical ethicist said that was not wrong
<br>
or bloody obvious.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Suppose it turns out that both Aristotle and Kant were a couple of dog-kicking
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; baby-punching immoral pricks  in practice. Would this in itself constitute a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;refutation of their theoretical writings on ethics?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, because it would show to the world that their ethics were not useful, nobody
<br>
can live by them, not ever the person who made it. The only standard to judge good ethics
<br>
from bad is that one will make a happier world and one will not, impractical ethics will not.
<br>
Of course a medical ethicist would not agree with me, he would sneer and call it utilitarian,
<br>
as if something that works is bad.

<p><em>    &gt;I find it rather hard to  believe that medical ethicists see as their aim to increase

<p>I agree, and I'm sure Attila The Hun thought himself to be a very nice person too,
<br>
but I'm not interested in motivations or self assessments I'm interested in results.
