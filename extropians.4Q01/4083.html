<p>I've recently enjoyed Harry Browne's &quot;How I found freedom in an unfree
<br>
world&quot; (ISBN : 0965603679), and in fact, relating to a recent
<br>
discussion on the list, there are some nice recommendations about
<br>
sexual jealousy in it, too !
<br>
<p>Some of the ideas I recall in no order on that topic are that 1) by
<br>
&quot;forcing&quot; someone not to entertain relationships with others you only
<br>
increase the interest they have in such relationships (and the
<br>
tendency they have to idealize the potential other mates), and so you
<br>
only put yourself into more trouble; 2) a trick he proposes to smooth
<br>
the jealousy is to picture in your mind the worst imaginable things,
<br>
the most dreaded, which he thinks will de-sensitivize (??) you about
<br>
it; 3) it is not even in your interest to have your partner
<br>
constrained in any way ; and if it is too much of a struggle to get
<br>
along you should probably look for someone else. (a recurrent theme in
<br>
the book being that you should not try to change people)
<br>
<p>Relating to the last point, I personnaly always was very impressed by
<br>
the variability of characters, and specifically of sexual preferences.
<br>
It really seems that, &quot;à chacun sa chacune&quot; as French say, in other
<br>
words : every one can find his/her perfect match, however weird one
<br>
may seem to some.
<br>
<p>In an evolutionary thinking context, I find this huge variability
<br>
thought-provoking -- though I am not sure what conclusion to draw
<br>
about it.
<br>
<p>Relating to the second point, I would give this as an exercise for an
<br>
author : get rid of your jealousy by writing a text. It's the kind of
<br>
magical power a good writer has.
<br>

<br>
<p><p>PS : Harry Browne's book did remind me about a recent and very nice
<br>
and funny French film (I don't know if it was distributed outside
<br>
France) which is in fact called &quot;Harry, un ami qui vous veut du bien&quot;
<br>
(!) (<a href="http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005AS4D/">http://www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005AS4D/</a>), in which a
<br>
character named Harry, out of a desire to help his friend, ends up
<br>
killing his parents, and (almost) his wife, as they seem to be &quot;in the
<br>
way&quot; of his friend's happiness...
