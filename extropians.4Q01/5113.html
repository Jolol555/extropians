<p>I dunno, that very terminology might entail a moral tangle. `Conceive a
<br>
child'? That's a proleptic or forward-casting turn of phrase which seems to
<br>
imply that *terminating* the conception would kill or erase an actual
<br>
child, when in fact--as *you* imply--all that's happening in the case of
<br>
blastocyte tissue harvesting is the equivalent of all those many natural
<br>
miscarriages which flush away somewhere between 50 and 80% of natural
<br>
conceptions during menstruation. (Not that *this* is a water-tight argument
<br>
either; `is' never implies `ought', and dying of Fanconi's anemia is
<br>
perfectly `natural' too).
<br>
<p>But in the instance I cited, what's planned is to harvest stem cells from
<br>
an actual post-birth baby's discarded umbilical cord. So that *does*
<br>
require carrying and giving birth to the baby, and is plainly a
<br>
mealy-mouthed but perhaps minimax solution satisfactory to, say, Catholic
<br>
ethicists and medical specialists alike. It's known to work (whereas, I
<br>
think, gathering stem cells from early embryos perhaps isn't yet
<br>
established as reliable). And it doesn't kill any baby, proto-baby,
<br>
potential baby or gleam in the eye of god--to the contrary. In the short to
<br>
medium term, it might well be a solution agreeable to all those who are not
<br>
fearful that parents will treat the new kid as a bin of spare parts (which
<br>
is, anyway, a psychologically inane dread, in almost all situations I can
<br>
imagine*).

<br>
*although, given some of the bizarre opinions recently spouted on this
<br>
list, I'm starting to wonder.
