<em>&gt; I think democratic societies, particularly those where we increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the communication bandwidth between individuals (so I know what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know and you know what I know, without years of debates) may approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what Anders desires -- because it seems that it will become increasingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognized that it will be the optimal solution for &quot;being more with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less&quot;.  I also think that in such societies force will not be necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to achieve the optimal results.  If I decide to remain at the butterfly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level and Anders decides live at the Aristoi level, then as a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; butterfly, I would happily turn my matter and energy over to Anders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for better extropic uses.
</em><br>
&lt;Big Snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this may bring some closure (at least from my perspective)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the differing views related to &quot;Extropian morality&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Looks like you are fairly easy to satisfy. ;) How exactly do you understand
<br>
the locution 'better extropic use'? Surely the metaphorical contrast with
<br>
entropy cannot be taken literally and applied across the board. Are we
<br>
supposed to rank the worth of everything in the universe according to the
<br>
second law of thermodynamics or in an information theoretic sense a la
<br>
Shannon and Bell? Are we always to prefer the more complex piece of music to
<br>
the simpler? The more complex work of art to the simpler? The more complex
<br>
scientific theory to the simpler? Should we choose to upload a James Joyce
<br>
type brain stuffed with the minutiae of everyday life as opposed to
<br>
Einstein's just because the former takes more bits to upload? I think we
<br>
need to talk about quality here as opposed to merely quantity. But of course
<br>
this is to move beyond the metaphor suggested by entropy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tradition that takes serious the quality issue is that of
<br>
perfectionism--from Aristotle to Nietzsche. This tradition says that we
<br>
ought to rank as better those individuals that best develop their natures or
<br>
best embody the standards of some worthwhile activity. Aristotle says that
<br>
the best humans are those that developed their rationality to the highest
<br>
degree, because rationality is what makes us human. Nietzsche says that the
<br>
best humans are those that demonstrate the greatest development of the will
<br>
to power. The Rawlian formulation (roughly) is that the best scientists are
<br>
those that best develop science according to the standards of excellence of
<br>
science. It may be that the negentropy and perfectionist's view are
<br>
extensionally equivalent, in which case a healthy pragmatism will allow us
<br>
to divide through on the difference here. But I doubt it. Mark
