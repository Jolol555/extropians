In a recent book review, I wrote:
<br>
<p>====================
<br>
<p>I was walking with pals in their pleasant backyard as a bunch of dear
<br>
little honey-eaters swooped and sang their hearts out above a sprinkler.
<br>
`Ah, look how they sport and carol for the very joy of it!' a friend cried,
<br>
clapping her hands to her breast. 
<br>
<p>You could see her point, and it was a gladdening thing to behold.
<br>
`Actually,' I mentioned, `what they're really saying is either &quot;This turf
<br>
will be defended with lethal force&quot; or &quot;Feel like a quickie? I'm sure
<br>
you'll like it.&quot; ' My friend stared at me in disgust. But this cynical
<br>
estimate was not my fault, Darwin made me do it. Or perhaps it was Wallace,
<br>
as we'll see in a moment. It's those genes, you see, one way or another. 
<br>
<p>Isn't this a dreadfully reductive way to look at the world? How about those
<br>
other dear little birdies that shout at the top of their voices when a
<br>
dangerous intruder approaches, saving the flock at great risk to
<br>
themselves? A raven will call others to join the feast when it stumbles on
<br>
a carcase, rather than gorging alone. Surely this is natural altruism in
<br>
action, the very antithesis of those notoriously misunderstood `selfish
<br>
genes' that
<br>
zoologist Richard Dawkins made famous--and which have been disputed hotly
<br>
by his territorial rival, paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould?
<br>
<p>...At least with ravens, reality is less than
<br>
noble. If a juvenile bird without territory chances upon something dead and
<br>
tasty, it'll be seen off by the larger adult who holds the turf. Calling in
<br>
other young hoons overwhelms the incumbent's defence. Everyone gets a
<br>
share, but it's smart politics, not the golden rule. And the recipes for
<br>
such political strategies have been conserved as genes selected by brute
<br>
survival.
<br>
<p>For Dawkins, evolution is finally about the preferential survival of clumps
<br>
of adapted, co-operating genetic replicators (selfish in the sense
<br>
that unless they create effective bodies, they'll perish). Gould, by
<br>
contrast, wishes to stress the role of the whole organism and indeed
<br>
species, lineages sometimes smashed by natural catastrophes that make
<br>
locally effective adaptations abruptly irrelevant. No gene is
<br>
rewarded--selected--on its own; it takes a village to put many genes into
<br>
effect (at least among humans). 
<br>
<p>..........
<br>
<p>My pal and sometime co-author Rory Barnes, a philosopher by training,
<br>
commented:
<br>
................
<br>
<em>&gt;  But this cynical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimate was not my fault, Darwin made me do it. Or perhaps it was Wallace,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we'll see in a moment. It's those genes, you see, one way or another.
</em><br>
<p>Quite so. But the reductionist should beware of the belief that showing how
<br>
something arose, or how it is put together, or how it has prior causes etc
<br>
etc demonstrates that the putative thing or state of affairs 'doesn't really
<br>
exist.'  The dear little birds can be having stax of happy innocent fun and
<br>
be enjoying themselves no end without in any way precluding a Darwinian
<br>
explanation of their behaviour. Or for that matter a Darwinian explanation
<br>
of their experience. Having fun has survival value. Especially if what the
<br>
birds are having fun doing is defending territory or selecting a mate or
<br>
committing adultery. You might as well tell a human that science has shown
<br>
that the poor twit's naive belief that he enjoys a good fuck is all
<br>
illusion, the activity has actually been genetically programmed by an
<br>
endless process of natural selection to blindly produce a state of affairs
<br>
in which his genes have the greatest chance of being passed on. Indeed it
<br>
has, but the guy can still like doing it. And he can even reach for a condom
<br>
if he has a mind to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the recipes for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political strategies have been salted away as genes selected by brute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival.
</em><br>
<p>Yea verily, but the Ravens can still have a great time calling in the young
<br>
hoons and getting into their tuck.
<br>
<p>===================
<br>
<p>Quite, as Rory sez, so.
