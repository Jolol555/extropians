</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a debate?

<p>Do you claim otherwise?

<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; However, whether Hiroshima or Nagasaki were legitimate targets

<em>&gt; &gt; legitimate for military forces. It can be said that nukes are

<em>&gt; &gt; specifically political, not military, weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'd say they are a bit of both, depending on their use. Tactical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nukes are not very political, unless you are a german farmer.
</em><br>
<p>Of course. The NATO strategy was always acknowledged as a rather extreme
<br>
measure, and was based on assumptions about the logistical abilities of
<br>
the Warsaw Pact that may have been true at one time, but were completely
<br>
unfounded by 1984.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, note that Leahy's statement uses the qualifier &quot;Materal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assistance&quot;. Whether a weapons use is of material assistance or not is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completely separate from whether it is of psychological assistance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um. I would suggest he was saying &quot;did it end the war or not?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>No, he wasn't. He was making a value judgement of the legitimacy of
<br>
psychological warfare as a military strategy. The vast majority of the
<br>
US offier corps, until Vietnam, was steadfastly against the regular use
<br>
of psychological warfare, special forces unconventional warfare, and
<br>
general guerrilla tactics as 'ungentlemanly' and 'unchivalrous'. This
<br>
point of view was based on their decades of indoctrination in
<br>
traditional principles of honor, honesty, and fair dealing that arose
<br>
from the era of condotierre armies in europe in the 15th to 17th
<br>
centuries, where mercenary armies faced off against each other squarely
<br>
on the battlefield, met to agree on the rules, fought to points of honor
<br>
and not to the death. This was reinforced by the Civil War, where most
<br>
officers on both sides had known each other well at West Point as
<br>
cadets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it had so terrified the japanese that they had changed from a stance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;death before surrender!&quot; to &quot;JESUS CHRIST WE'RE GIVING IN NOW! NOW!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOW!&quot; I'd say it *would* be considered of &quot;material assistance&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are engaging in some sophistry here.
</em><br>
<p>No, I am being very specific, just as military officers are trained to
<br>
be in their statements. If he said 'material assistance', he
<br>
specifically did not mean 'assistance in general' or 'psychological
<br>
assistance' in particular.
