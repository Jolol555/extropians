<p>Excellent post Geraint.  One additional point for those unfamiliar with UK 
<br>
policing:  It's important also to take into account the arming of police 
<br>
forces.  While the UK beat cop is unarmed, there are armed units for 
<br>
dealing with crimes involving firearms e.g. armed robberies, hostage 
<br>
situations etc...  It is the same here.
<br>
<p>In fact, we recently had an incident here in Ireland where a policeman was 
<br>
shot and killed during what was believed to be an armed raid.  It turned 
<br>
out he was accidentally shot by another officer.
<br>
<p>It would be intriguing to see if an armed police force would make any 
<br>
difference to the UK statistics.  My guess is it wouldn't, as those who 
<br>
commit crime using firearms know they will face armed officers.
<br>
<p>It is interesting to note that it is likely that the British (and indeed 
<br>
Irish) police forces would face a massive loss of officers if weapons were 
<br>
introduced as standard equipment.
<br>

<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
