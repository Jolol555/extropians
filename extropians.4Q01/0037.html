</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Um. Then why would they do it?
</em><br>
<p>Because they weren't as confident as you and I that the universe just
<br>
doesn't work that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For the simple reason that it is an extension regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies of the placebo effect.  I can easily see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective where &quot;prayer&quot; could substitute for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; placebo, particularly in situations where the individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved might have a greater faith in their &quot;god&quot; than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their physician which seems likely to be the case with in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vitro fertilization where the success rates are low.
</em><br>
<p>They were allegedly very careful to eliminate that route - i.e., none of
<br>
the participants even knew they were being prayed for, the doctors didn't
<br>
know which group was which, etc.
<br>
<p>I actually rather like this study.  As described it has no apparent
<br>
methodological flaws, and the alleged effect is nice and blatant rather
<br>
than some tiny little statistical deviation.  It doesn't matter whether
<br>
the original study was performed as claimed, because it's very easy to try
<br>
and reproduce the results using the method they outlined.  You do what
<br>
they claim to have done, and either there's a nice big blatant effect and
<br>
the experimental result has been reproduced, or there's no effect or a
<br>
small just-barely-stastically-noticeable effect and the experimental
<br>
result has been disconfirmed.  All discussion of psi should be this
<br>
straightforward.
<br>
<p>You see, what I dislike most about psi research are all these claimed tiny
<br>
little effects.  You shouldn't have to squint so hard to see reality.  The
<br>
existence of a multitude of badly confirmed small percentage deviations
<br>
that require refined statistics to detect is the predicted result of the
<br>
investigation of imaginary phenomena by wishful researchers.
<br>
<p>I have no problem with someone claiming a nice large blatant effect.  You
<br>
investigate and either it's there or it isn't.  Of course, I predict from
<br>
my own understanding of the Universe that the effect will fail to be
<br>
reproduced.
