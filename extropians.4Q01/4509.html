&lt;&lt; btw, what is an NT, what is an AC??? Poor social creature wants to know... &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>For the newly initiated:
<br>
NT = Neurotypical, the vast majority of the population who have no social handicap
<br>
AC = Autistic &amp; Cousins, the socially handicapped sector of the population
<br>
(covering both low and high functioning as well as Asperger's &amp; other PDDs)
<br>
<p>Having AC does come with a heavy price, especially when the vast majority does not understand your behaviour. Personally, it feels
<br>
kind of like crash-landing on some strange planet and having to find your way among apparently native inhabitants who constantly
<br>
display unusual behavior that catches you unawares.
<br>
<p>The worse thing you discover: You can't get another alien ship to leave (or to put it more bluntly, escape) this strange and
<br>
sometimes nasty planet.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Robert, my dear pal and benefactor--I think I'd have to counsel you against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making placing such revelations on the net. They'll come back to bite you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and maybe the rest of us, by contagion) on the ass.
</em><br>
<p>I start to suspect that a significent load of mail will come when significent numbers of extropians realise they might belong to the
<br>
AC catagory.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think it was Eric who mentioned that Dr Allan Snyder is also autistic. Cf.:
</em><br>
<p>I don't quite recall saying anything about Dr Allan, but of course you might mean other Erics.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But I think that announcing one's autism or Aspergerish nature might prove,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least in the short term, the social equivalent of confessing to being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kleptomaniac or a compulsive womanizer. The public might tend thereafter to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disregard one's utterances, however unfairly (especially if they involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plans to tear down the solar system for spare parts).
</em><br>
<p>I think you might find it better to say so yourself rather than having others discover that the Extropian community contains a large
<br>
number of &quot;space aliens&quot; who want to &quot;take over the solar system&quot; and dismantle it.
<br>
<p>I think we ought to have a better understanding of ourselves if we want to execute such &quot;ambitious&quot; projects (though to me they
<br>
sound a little mundane as I have the whole universe in mind). I suggest having an AC survey to determine the exact proportion of ACs
<br>
in this mailing list, for starters. At least those &quot;alien conspiracies&quot; would leave us alone.
<br>
<p>Don't lose sleep over your alienness so much, at least those of us ACs might get along better with sentient AIs than NTs.
