<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One should not forget that the German Buzz-bombing of London
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was intended for civilians.  I'd view the British bombing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hamburg as tit-for-tat.  (Whether it was in violation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Geneva convention remains an open question).
</em><br>
<p>Actually its more complicated than that.  I forget exactly when the German 
<br>
bombing of Britain began, but at first they targeted British industry, 
<br>
instead of bombing indiscriminantly.  Unfortunately for all concerned, some 
<br>
of the German bombs went off target, and were assumed to be an 
<br>
escalation.  The Brits responded by bombing Berlin, the Germans responded, 
<br>
and we all know how it turned out.  So, though the Germans started the 
<br>
bombing of cities, both sides believed that they were responding to 
<br>
escalation when they started bombing purely civilian targets.  Such are the 
<br>
tragedies of war.  Oh, this information comes from &quot;Rise and Fall of the 
<br>
Third Reich,&quot; which I read last spring, but don't currently have a copy 
<br>
of.  If someone could be so kind as to fill in dates I'd be glad.
