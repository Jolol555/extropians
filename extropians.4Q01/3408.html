<p>
In an effort to limit my verbosity I'm going to make this brief.
<br>
<p>Lee Silver was on Charlie Rose tonight talking about the ACT work.
<br>
He felt the work was about &quot;technical&quot; advances showing the potential
<br>
usefullness of &quot;therapeutic&quot; cloning.  He argued that people
<br>
need to recognize that stem cell research and &quot;therapeutic&quot;
<br>
cloning are deeply intertwined (because in most treatments
<br>
you would prefer to use stem cells derived from the indivdual
<br>
being treated) [I have ways around this but they require
<br>
further technological advances.]  (The implication is that
<br>
President Bush's position that you shouldn't &quot;create life to
<br>
destroy life&quot; is fundamentally limiting the applications of the
<br>
stem cell research he does find acceptable.) Silver thought the reason
<br>
for publishing the work was to promote public discussion about
<br>
its usefullness.  He agreed that the development of the
<br>
techniques would lead to the possibility of &quot;reproductive&quot;
<br>
cloning and estimated that would occur within 5 years.
<br>
<p>He made it clear that he thought the cloning debate was a
<br>
&quot;Red Herring&quot; because the history of IVF has shown that
<br>
we can produce &quot;normal&quot; children using such methods
<br>
and that natural human emotions prevail and we treat
<br>
individuals created using such methods as &quot;normal&quot; people.
<br>
<p>Generally speaking I thought his perspective was quite extropic
<br>
(for someone who wears a bioethicist hat from time to time).
<br>
<p>Related to the discussion, I'm moderately certain that fingerprint
<br>
ridges are developmentally determined and not genetically determined.
<br>
I don't believe identical twins have the same fingerprints. See:
