</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Incorrect. Jordan booted them (Palestinians) out decades ago in response
<br>
to a coup attempt, and Syria conducted extensive genocides of whole
<br>
palestinian camps and deported the rest to Lebanon. While muslims per se
<br>
are not treated as second class citizens, muslim doesn't necessarily
<br>
equate to 'palestinian'. On the other hand, Jews ARE treated as second
<br>
class citizens in EVERY muslim country, and are frequently the victims
<br>
of pogroms and other repressions that never make the news.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Don't get me wrong, I'd like to see this set right, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Palestinians are every bit as much at fault, if not more so, than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Israelis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See, that's where I'm not so sure.  With our media and government so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much under the influence of Jewish media moguls, have we as Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been getting a reasonably objective view of the events in Israel and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Middle East?  From my conversations with friends outside of the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media-sphere, I get the feeling that the Palestinians are much less at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fault than we've been lead to believe.
</em><br>
<p>Lets see now, looking at the news releases through the international
<br>
press the last several months, it seems that all targets of Israeli
<br>
attacks, and most victims, are militants engaged in illegal combatant
<br>
activities (terrorism), while every instance of dead Israelis shows that
<br>
they are inevitably either civilian victims of terrorist bombings, or
<br>
soldiers attempting to defend against terrorist attacks. 
<br>
<p>When the negotiators on one side are demanding 7 days of no attacks,
<br>
while the other side says that attacks will continue until they all are
<br>
engaged in peace talks, it is rather evident to anyone who can actually
<br>
think, which side is the agressor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, this is more than just about Israel.  This is also about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; continued US support for puppet regimes like in Saudi Arabia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Kuwait.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Sure, the US talks a good game about democracy and freedom, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Middle Easterners who would wish to have freedom and democracy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; their own countries have to not only battle their own governments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; but also the dollars and military of the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So what right to we have to go around kicking in governments?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Straw man.  Who said anything about &quot;kicking in governments&quot;?  I'd just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like us to get out of the whole area.  Leave Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let those governments stabilize and defend themselves.  If they want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help in creating secular democracies, then it's probably worth it for us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give them a hand.  Currently, though, I don't understand why we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting the countries that we are.
</em><br>
<p>You still have not answered my demand to show where in the US budget we
<br>
are providing any financial aid of any sort to the governments of Saudi
<br>
Arabia or Kuwait (Kuwait, BTW IS a democratic government).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Liberals always want to have things both ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, man.  I certainly hope that you're not calling me a liberal.  Them's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fightin' words.  I'd characterize myself as a libertarian, or at worst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an atheistic conservative.
</em><br>
<p>With a tendency to apologize for anyone who hates jews.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The Cold War is over.  This support of the &quot;lesser of evils&quot; no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; longer makes the sense that it did a couple of decades ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Which is better, a corrupt government or a fundamentalist one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who knows?  In this case, the corrupt one was more predisposed to us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of our past intervention on their behalf, and because they know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that our continued support is required for them to stay in power.  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, our occupation of Saudi Arabia is one of the prime reasons why we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just lost over 6,000 people and billions of dollars.  Maybe supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fundamentalist one would have been cheaper.
</em><br>
<p>Please explain to me how in hell the US can &quot;occupy&quot; Saudi Arabia, a
<br>
nation of several million people, with a contingent of only 500 people?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We should just get the hell out of the support business for governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are fundamentalist, corrupt, or both.
</em><br>
<p>How about getting out of the support business of apologizing for
<br>
terrorist groups that are even more fundamentalist than the goverments
<br>
that they want out of power?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I'd rather see us withdraw from the Middle East completely than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; continue to be embarrassed about our policies there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There are places in the middle east where we are welcome, Kuwait
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course we are.  They've gotten filthy rich selling us oil at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collusion-obtained prices (OPEC), yet when they have trouble with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbors, we take care of it for them.  A lot of good it did for our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil prices this past summer when they went along with all of the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OPEC nations in reducing production.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, now Russia has turned on the spigots, isn't a member of OPEC, and
<br>
is quite happy to keep the oil flowing as long as we want.
