<p>And what kind of new car did your friend buy for under $10K?

<p><em> &gt;I'm not sure what milk costs these days.

<p>It's around $1.50 per quart in central Texas.

<p>I was comparing metro areas with metro areas. Costs are lower in smaller
<br>
towns, both in Australia and in the US. In general, as Patrick W. has said,
<br>
an item that costs US$10 in the US would be A$10 in Australia. Certain items
<br>
are higher. Restaurant prices, for example, are a bit higher in $A than in
<br>
$US. I think this is mainly because salaries of waitpersons are higher in
<br>
Australia, where tipping is not as universal as it is in the States. Goods
<br>
imported from the US cost roughly twice as much in $A as in $US--for example
<br>
a Dell Inspiron computer is about US$1,000 in the US and about A$2,000 in
<br>
Australia. But other imported items, such as Japanese cars, seem
<br>
significantly less expensive in Australia--Japanese cars seem to cost in the
<br>
neighborhood of A$1.6 for each $1 US.
