<em>&gt; Why do you make this an issue? The outer solar system is a loooooong

</em><br>
<p>For the reason I mention -- that it is in theory possible Pluto
<br>
will not be there when the probe gets there.
<br>
<p>It isn't the fact that the outer solar system is a long distance away.
<br>
Its the fact that we don't have the energy budget to launch a probe
<br>
at 0.1c to get there!  At 0.1c (the Project Daedalus Starship design
<br>
speed), it only takes 1.9 days to get to Pluto.  So assuming its
<br>
an unmanned probe (no need to accelerate &amp; decelerate at 1g), we
<br>
could probably launch a probe in 2019 and have it get there before
<br>
the 2006 launched probe.
<br>
<p>Part of the point I'm trying to make is the possibility of a future
<br>
depression in conventional engineering applications.  When it becomes
<br>
obvious that &quot;real&quot; nanotech is just the blink of an eye away, where
<br>
the &quot;blink&quot; may be anything from a year to 20 years (as is the case
<br>
with the NASA probe), it will become pointless to do certain construction
<br>
or exploration activities the &quot;old&quot; way.
<br>
<p>Given that it will probably take 10 years to rebuild the WTC
<br>
(if they decide to rebuild it), does it not make sense to wait
<br>
until you can build it out of diamondoid which is much stronger
<br>
than steel and/or titanium carbide which has a much higher M.P.?
<br>
<p>NASA runs into the problem before most engineering firms because
<br>
some of its missions have such long lifetimes.  Because some of
<br>
them are so expensive -- I think the Pluto-Kuiper mission price
<br>
tag is $400M -- looking at the big picture one has to ask at what
<br>
point shifing that amount of funds into nanotech development
<br>
would payoff with the same science being done sooner because
<br>
it would have accelerated the development curve?
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p>Homework problem for Amara -- how much energy/radiation is the probe
<br>
going to produce encountering inner solar system dust at 0.1c?
<br>
(Another way of looking at the question is, &quot;What should the inner
<br>
solar system speed limits be set at?&quot;.)
