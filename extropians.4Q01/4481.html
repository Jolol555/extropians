<br>
<p><em>&gt;Amara,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thank you a lot for this post.  It is very valuable to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perspective on what is happening here from outside.  Especially from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;someone who both knows the US as only a citizen can and has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away long enough to note the differences more starkly since 911 than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those who have been here throughout the fallout from this tragedy.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for saying this. You're the first one who has noted that I
<br>
have an unusual perspective on the last months.
<br>
<p>While I was in the States the last weeks, I met a Belgian scientist
<br>
who has been living in the U.S. for the last few years, and we are
<br>
now exchanging observations of the U.S. since September 11: him as a
<br>
nonAmerican but living in the U.S. during the last few years, and
<br>
me, as an American, but living outside of the U.S. during the last
<br>
few years. I would bet a large sum of money that what he and I will
<br>
both learn are some new appreciations for important things American
<br>
and important things nonAmerican.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A few comments on sections are below.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Finally, I observed a transformation in America, that frankly scared
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; me. It's there now, and is trickling outside. Fear, suspicions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sometimes paranoia. Boundaries and borders are being heavily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fortified, civil rights are being trampled right and left, and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the most part, I didn't hear people complaining about that (the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exception was the the ~1000 people who are held in jails with no due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; process for 'suspicious terrorist activity'). In human history's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; most wretched times,  people were labeled and then burned,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; quartered, persecuted, and I see this kind of fear-based labelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on people appearing again. I couldn't escape the feeling that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; place where I was born and lived for most of my life (the U.S.) has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; gone a little bit insane.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes.  This really freaks me out.  Most of the population seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;giving in to fear and to be successfully manipulated by the powers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that be to go along with whatever is proposed as long as the magic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wand of &quot;stopping terrorism&quot; is waved.
</em><br>
<p>'War on Terrorism' is a very easy umbrella for the U.S. and other
<br>
governments to do what they do best, which is to find as many ways
<br>
as possible to restrict and control our lives. It's the politician's
<br>
livelihood, after all to find ways to make a living for themselves.
<br>
<p>However, in this case, the fears are so strong, that it looks to me
<br>
that U.S. folks are willingly handing over the most basic rights built
<br>
into the U.S. Constitution (which came from even more basic
<br>
principles 2000 years ago). That's what worries me. If the
<br>
government of the free-est country on Earth can do that with the
<br>
full support that it is currently receiving from its citizens (other
<br>
world governments of less-free countries are now following along
<br>
easily), then what can we say about the future of humans on this
<br>
planet?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Before I moved out of the U.S. ~4 years ago, I was, in a small way, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pacifist, believing that one doesn't answer violence with yet again
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more violence. I also believe that any group's rampant unhappiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or disrest has an element of truth embedded, and it must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; addressed in a civil way, or the violent cycle will continue. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; events since September 11, and my U.S. observations the last weeks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have polarized me (unexpectedly) much more as a pacifist, and I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; now that the U.S. is not a good fit as an environment for me to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (or to raise a kid).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Before 911 I wasn't a pacifist.  Now I am becoming a staunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believer in non-violence, at all levels right down to speech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought. Why?  Because I do not believe there is escape from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorism without escaping from the automatic reaching for violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whenever sufficiently provoked or threatened.
</em><br>
<p>Fear. This emotion is as strong or stronger then love, and I don't
<br>
think that a human can react externally to danger in a healthy way
<br>
until they understand much better how they react internally to
<br>
danger. When the fear begins, clearly something major is
<br>
threatening. A normal psychological response is to shut down,
<br>
barricade ourselves behind a wall of beliefs which grip us until the
<br>
fear-wall disappears or we remove it.
<br>
<p>To handle fear... How might one do that? Have you noticed that a way
<br>
to handle fear is to simply go into it? Well, it's not simple, and
<br>
actually, it might be the most difficult thing to do when we're
<br>
afraid. It is so easy to sabotage our lives by cooking up a
<br>
collection of phobias where we convince ourselves of various
<br>
'facts'. Once we let go of the anxiety and neurotic fear, we have a
<br>
strength and balance for how to deal with it, even when the danger
<br>
still exists.
<br>
<p>In a group scale, I believe that we do the same thing. If
<br>
something is dangerous, the wrong thing to do is to barricade
<br>
ourselves behind a wall of unreasonable fears, and respond as
<br>
barbarians to barbaric acts. Instead, drop the phobias, so that we
<br>
have a strength and balance for how to deal with it.
<br>
<p>One way that I handle my own fears is to support and cultivate
<br>
acceptance of 'Otherness'. It should be easy to do for Americans
<br>
because American 'culture' is comprised of a huge mix of other
<br>
cultures. I was born in Hawaii, my father was born in Latvia and my
<br>
mother's family came from Greece and Germany. When I was in New
<br>
Orleans two weeks ago, I met locals there who spoke only French for
<br>
several generations, and I spent evenings in music clubs listening
<br>
to music that was emerged from Africans/AmericanIndians/Spanish
<br>
music. The music was the best I had ever heard in my life, and the
<br>
invigorating chaotic mix of cultures I encountered there woke up
<br>
parts of me I wasn't aware of. It's part of being alive, and in the
<br>
best way.
<br>
<p>Here in front of Americans' eyes is evidence that the variety that
<br>
other cultures brings to the U.S. has hugely enriched our lives.
<br>
Americans and American culture is born from 'Otherness', so denying
<br>
it, is a little like psychologically cutting off pieces of our body.
<br>
The paranoic attitudes that I saw and heard about and witnessed
<br>
during the last weeks looked to me like Americans are in the process
<br>
of cutting off integral parts of themselves, in their approach to
<br>
handle their fears.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If I accepted the premise of violence being a healthy tool right now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would be arming myself to the teeth and digging in, frankly.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also feel that it is very important to remove the seed of xenophobia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and of dividing the world into us vs. them if we are to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future, much less a happy and viable one.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.
<br>
