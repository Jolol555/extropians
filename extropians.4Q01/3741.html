<p>&nbsp;Greg:
<br>
<p>This can't be right, Rafal.  I come to your home with a gun and tell you
<br>
that I have decided that I like your house and the land upon which it sits.
<br>
I've decided that you must leave, so that I can have it.  I back up my
<br>
argument with the gun in my hand.  Wisely or unwisely, you leave, and I take
<br>
possession of your house.
<br>
<p>Let us assume that you had good title to your land and house, for which you
<br>
paid money.  Now, let us assume that you have children after leaving your
<br>
house at gunpoint, and then you die.  You are saying that your children have
<br>
NO claim to the property you were forced to vacate, simply because I or my
<br>
descendants continue to believe that my forced expropriation was somehow
<br>
right?
<br>
<p>This result is not the law in any civilized society, and thus the children
<br>
of, for instance, people from whom the Nazis stole works of art are able to
<br>
recover them from, for instance, museums that now hold them. 
<br>
<p>The law governing the simple case I describe is much more difficult to apply
<br>
when those who make competing claims have some basis other than mere force
<br>
upon which to base those claims, and when claims are based on truly ancient
<br>
sources or, worse yet, religious sources.  But principles other than simple
<br>
possession MUST be applied to resolutions of such conflicts, or security in
<br>
one's life and property is truly impossible.
<br>
<p>### I believe that Steve Davies offered a very good explanation and defense
<br>
of the view I presented, so let me just add a few points:
<br>
<p>Property rights (and all other rights) are always defined within and limited
<br>
by the framework of an enforcing organization. Either you have a gun
<br>
yourself or else you have men with guns working for you. If not, your (and
<br>
your children's) property claims are meaningless, and will be disregarded by
<br>
whoever feels like it. As I mentioned in another post, might does not make
<br>
right, but rights cannot exist without might.
<br>
<p>The analogy between a single person illegally evicting me from my home and
<br>
an ethnic group forcibly removing their rivals from a land is not very
<br>
close. My individual property rights are usually defined within the context
<br>
of a state, or another territorial organization, and as long as the state is
<br>
operating correctly, my claims to my home are secure. A nation's claim to
<br>
land has been and still is de facto defined by their willingness and ability
<br>
to defend the land against aggression. Only very recently did the
<br>
international community start to play a more active role in the protection
<br>
of nations from external attacks.
<br>
<p>If an ethnic group is capable of maintaining possession of violently
<br>
acquired land long enough for the next generation of children to grow up
<br>
there, then these children should acquire a right to live in that land -
<br>
otherwise you would be punishing children for the transgressions of their
<br>
fathers. Exacting a price from the next generation would be against the
<br>
Extropian principle of self-direction and individual responsibility. The
<br>
result of such an approach would be an endless chain of violence, bloody
<br>
vendetta, and perhaps using ancient claims merely as a pretext for attack.
<br>
The &quot;living memory&quot; rule or other limitations on property right must be
<br>
applied, no matter how horrible are the grievances of the dispossessed or
<br>
how intuitively just their claims appear. Only growing up in a land or being
<br>
granted citizenship by the actual and lawful owners should be a legitimate
<br>
basis for a claim of ownership. Having parents who lost a war shouldn't.
<br>
Violent acquisition of land must be reversed and punished quickly (10-15
<br>
years) or never.
<br>
<p>Of course, if it is at all possible, actual perpetrators of ethnic violence,
<br>
but not their offspring, should be brought to justice and punished
<br>
regardless of the amount of time passed since their crimes, as long as
<br>
incontrovertible evidence against them exists (as is the case with genocide
<br>
and crimes against humanity in many legislatures).
