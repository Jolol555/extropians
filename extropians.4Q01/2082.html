<em>&gt; Let's think abt this. If the universe were meaningless and chaotic in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of `entirely random', and we are critters from an evolved lineage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a universe, why would we `need meaning and structure in our lives'?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely we would tend to be fitted by selection to work happily without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrived meaning and structure.
</em><br>
<p>Also, creatures cannot evolve in such a universe - without any order
<br>
there is no way to retain one's own order over time. There is likely a
<br>
threshold, not unlike the error threshold in gene replication, for how
<br>
much randomness a set of physical laws compatible with creatures can
<br>
maximally have. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the universe is chaotic in the dual senses that (1) simple regularities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when iterated result in immensely complex outcomes that are hard to `see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through' or predict, and (2) stuff outside any box is likely to burst in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and disrupt what is inside the box. Even so, moderately complex critters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are formed via iteration and retain a high degree of stability and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heritability. Meaning is therefore, in the first instance, the salience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure and noise  to the persistence and growth of evolved critters. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extent that restricted model-making gadgets like brains have trouble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locating the relevant structures, true meaning will evade our grasp--and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might tend to be replaced by stopgap templates drawn from better-understood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations (hence animism).
</em><br>
<p>Fits my view exactly. We humans extend meaning beyond mere survival into
<br>
other regions (like meaningful theological discussions - even the most
<br>
baroque scholastic argument, however divorced from reality, contains a
<br>
meaning perceptible to the theologicians). This is a great survival
<br>
trick: we can create new meanings not directly related to survival, which
<br>
allows second (and higher) order planning - but as a side effect it also
<br>
enables meaning constructs with absolutely no survival relevance.
<br>
Something which evolution has no need to select against unless it starts
<br>
interfering with survival. But to us humans, this excessive meaning
<br>
construction ability is very important and rewarding (and sometimes
<br>
painful). A bit like our agency detection - we tend to see agency behind
<br>
many events which just happen. Maybe the key to intelligence is these
<br>
excessive abilities being used far beyond their original realm of
<br>
applicability.
