George W. Bush says he isn't interested in &quot;nation-building&quot;.  I read this
<br>
to mean that after the war, Afghanistan will be left to become a rotting
<br>
hellhole that will shortly fall prey to yet another religious warlord.
<br>
<p>Nation-building is the only strategy that ever worked for America.  It is
<br>
only natural to suppose that America will never use it again.  The only
<br>
hope for the Afghani is that the war drags on until 2005 and we get a
<br>
better President.
<br>
<p>If it were up to me, I'd say go in with the troops and rebuild
<br>
Afghanistan.  Lay down roads.  Cart in modular housing and erect it as
<br>
fast as possible.  Build factories.  Build farms full of easy-to-operate
<br>
modernized farming equipment.  I don't think we could transform it into a
<br>
First World country overnight, that takes an educated populace, but - if
<br>
only we were interested in nation-building - we could just build a new
<br>
nation where Afghanistan used to be, and the Afghan military forces
<br>
certainly couldn't stop us.  It would at least be worth trying.
<br>
<p>Sigh.  Don't you wish McCain was in office right now?
