Yet another article on bioinformatics and future medicine:

Correlating genomic variation with drug response requires automation, clinical
<br>
data, and a lot of informatics technology.
<br>
<p>The most visually impressive feature of Genaissance Pharmaceuticals' New
<br>
Haven, Conn., facility is the room filled with rows of Applied Biosystems DNA
<br>
sequencers that are always running. However, it's what visitors can't see on
<br>
the standard company tours--a nondescript bank of computers tucked in an
<br>
out-of-the-way room on the top floor and the software that they run--that
<br>
distinguishes the company from the many other outfits setting up sequencing
<br>
technology.

<p>Keep ahead of the
information onslaught
&quot;In my experience for biotech in general, workflow or LIMS is a do or die
issue,&quot; says Windemuth. &quot;You can't do a high-throughput process without
reliable data management.&quot; To keep track of the data, Genaissance relies on
LIMS that they have written and those that are commercially available.
<p>Adds Stephens, &quot;Data management and processing are absolutely crucial. You can
imagine getting by with minimal requirements if you are analyzing one gene on
a single cohort. But when your throughput is close to a hundred new genes a
week, you would be utterly swamped without good LIMS and database management.&quot;

<p>Pharmacogenomics forecast
Judson sees a surge of interest in haplotypes and pharmacogenomics. &quot;When we
started in 1997, we were the haplotype company,&quot; he says. &quot;Our sales calls
tended to focus on teaching people what haplotypes were. Now that the NIH
[National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.] has announced they are going to
build a haplotype map, and several other companies doing similar things,
everyone has agreed that they are the best set of markers to use. That's been
a major change over the last year or so.&quot;
<p>Most companies now have pharmacogenomics groups, says Judson, and are looking
into the technology. GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, N.C., whose
program is headed by Allen David Roses, senior VP/genetics research, announced
plans to have a drug on the market within two years that will have a genetic
test associated with it. &quot;They were big drivers behind the SNP Consortium,&quot;
says Judson, referring to their efforts to create a publicly available SNP map
that were funded largely by pharmaceutical companies.
<p>On the diagnostic side, Judson also sees growing interest in SNPs.
&quot;Ultimately, if you have these tests done in the doctor's office, someone has
to be out there doing the test in a high-throughput way,&quot; he says. Quest
Diagnostics, one of the largest diagnostics firms, has set up a
pharmacogenomics arm to get tests running so that they could be available in
their approximately 10,000 sites around the country.
<p>&quot;The genotyping platforms have gotten much more robust, cost has come down,
and the number of people that do at least some genotyping has increased,&quot; says
Judson. &quot;There's a lot of interest all around. There's still a certain amount
of skepticism, but everybody feels like they have to play with it.&quot;

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
 consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
