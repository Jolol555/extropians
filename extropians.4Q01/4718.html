</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, all those things are needed but don't you think you better
<br>
make sure there is enough fresh water, food and shelter before
<br>
you start having them watch satellite TV?  Afghanistan in
<br>
particular was hugely dependent on basic food aid for some 1.2
<br>
million of its people to not starve even before the war.  Now
<br>
that number of people needing basic food aid to survive is
<br>
quadrupled.  So please, let us start with the true basics. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The current situation in Afghanistan follows directly from the cold war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russia wanting to expand its sphere of influence and the U.S. trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent that.  Whether the current Afghan situation is &quot;good&quot; depends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on how you balance it against the progress of democracy in Eastern Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Russia over the last decade.  Could we have done a better job?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most probably.  But as they say hindsight is 20-20.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it was at all that simple or benign or our part
<br>
but I will not go into it now.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The propping up of mad dictators &amp; inhumane juntas MUST stop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So should we bomb Uzbekistan and Tajikistan into rubble as well while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are at it?  Or would you prefer that we not have bases from which
</em><br>
<p>How on earth do you get that from the above?  Not propping up
<br>
mad dictators doesn't require you have to bomb anyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; military rescue operations can be conducted while the U.S. tries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleanup the mess in Afghanistan?  I'll note that it is *highly*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan Friendship Bridge would now be
</em><br>
<p>What &quot;military resuce operations&quot; do you have in mind?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; open (supplying food to people facing starvation) had the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken a &quot;hands off&quot; policy with regard to Afghanistan or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotten its hands &quot;dirty&quot; by dealing with Uzbekistan politicians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually there were quite cleanly operating trucking operations
<br>
into Afghanistan from Pakistan that brought in the majority of
<br>
the food before this war iirc.  We shut them down on or about
<br>
Sept. 16.  You can't insinuate that we made the ability to get
<br>
aid into the country better when in fact we have refused to let
<br>
much of the aid in for most of this war.  It was Gen. Tommy
<br>
Franks who kept the above bridge closed for so long. As far as I
<br>
know we still have some aid operations shut down for fear they
<br>
might also be of aid to Al Qaeda or make our search for bin
<br>
Laden harder.  If so we may be condemning quite a lot of people
<br>
to death by starvation and exposure this winter.  That has been
<br>
a continuing worry of mine.  Dealing with and &quot;propping up&quot; are
<br>
also not necessarily the same thing.
