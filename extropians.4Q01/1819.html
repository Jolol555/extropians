<em>&gt; Why is protection of publishing industries more important to American

</em><br>
<p>How does the 1st Amendment apply? Your right of free expression does not
<br>
mean you have the right to express other people's expressions without
<br>
their consent.
<br>
The 4th? Considering an artist who never makes any money because his art
<br>
is stolen by millions of ungrateful fans starves to death, I propose
<br>
that those convicted of intellectual property theft must live in a
<br>
homeless shelter with food stamps and government cheese. That is surely
<br>
not cruel and unusual. It is no worse than their victims got.
<br>
The 5th? dont' see it
<br>
The 10th? that is states rights.
<br>
An amendment does not eliminate something written into the body of the
<br>
Constitution unless it specifically says it does. One could say that
<br>
intellectual property rights, because they exist within the
<br>
constitution, are the 0th Amendment rights.
