<em>&gt; I believe the

</em><br>
<p>Not if you include the refugees, of which many will starve or freeze to 
<br>
death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There *really* is less freedom in countries outside of the U.S.
</em><br>
<p>There are such countries, right. Have you also been in Europe?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By arguing that the U.S. should not drop bombs, you *are*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing that it is proper and just that 28 million people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should have their freedom restricted by a handful of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious zealots.
</em><br>
<p>In the situation after 9-11, military actions may be the only effective 
<br>
thing to do. But since this also defines the endpoint of our options, we 
<br>
apparently have maneuvered ourself into a no-alternative situation. This is 
<br>
never a good position and clearly shows, that our leaders must have made 
<br>
serious mistakes.
<br>
<p>So, the 9-11 catastrophy and this war are the tragical but logical 
<br>
endpoints so far of wrong political ways in the years ago, as I've tried to 
<br>
show in other postings. We could have prevented it. Most of it, even the 
<br>
suicide attacks. Healthy democratic nations have no need to attack other 
<br>
countries, even if they have been militaristic rogue states before. You can 
<br>
come and visit me to see it here in Germany. The Marshall plan is one of 
<br>
the very few examples, where a country was healed and developed. (I'll 
<br>
leave out the reasons why the Marshall plan won over the Morgenthau plan, 
<br>
because the rationale is not very noble).
<br>
<p>The western world has mostly shown more interest to exploit other countries 
<br>
than to help them to become stable, democratic nations. We now get the 
<br>
receipt for our ignorance.
<br>
<p>What frustrates me most is the shortsightedness of political acting. You 
<br>
can easily get billions of dollars after a desaster to take revenge, but 
<br>
you have to beg for every cent to prevent cause for the desaster.
<br>
<p>So, to repeat my basic statement: I'm not saying that there is _now_ an 
<br>
alternative to violence. I'm saying that todays violence (and the dreadful 
<br>
no-alternative situation) is the result of former mistakes. IMO, we should 
<br>
see to prevent these situations, and if it is just to protect our own 
<br>
people.
