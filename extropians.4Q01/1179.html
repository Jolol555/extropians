<p>Randy replied:
<br>
<p>Oh, boy. More insults!
<br>
<p>### Huh?

Randy:
<br>
<p>I have stated many, many times, that I think that ANYONE and EVERYONE with a
<br>
<p>legitimate MD shoukd be able to come here to the USA. In fact, I have 
<br>
suggested PAYING them large sums of money to come here. I have suggested 
<br>
building medical schools in 3rd worlds so we can get MORE M.D.s here. The 
<br>
same thing goes for PhD's or even for *legitimate* students who want to 
<br>
study for a PhD here, and already have a *good* degree.
<br>
<p>### Good. Here we agree - persons with skills useful in the American economy
<br>
should not be prevented from joining the job market here, certainly not to
<br>
protect anybody's six-figure income from competition.

<p>You are wrong about immigrants in general being a plus for America, or for 
me. 
<p>### Let me quote myself:
<p>&gt;The question of regulating immigration can best be solved to the benefit of
&gt;the American nation by an impartial economic analysis aiming to optimize 
&gt;the
&gt;gains and reduce the losses due to immigration, both of which can be
&gt;measured.
<p>Never said unregulated or poorly regulated immigration is good for any
country.

Randy:
<p>But I see I cannot discuss this with you rationally because you cannot 
separate the issue from yuor emotions.
<p>#### Try it, maybe my emotions do not run as strong as you think.
