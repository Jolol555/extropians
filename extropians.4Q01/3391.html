&nbsp;Experts Rip Cloning 'Story'
<br>

<br>
Scientists say they've cloned the first human embryo, but critics are calling the announcement a shameless cry for
<br>
funding.Researchers at Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Massachusetts, announced on Sunday that they have cloned
<br>
the first human embryo -- an issue that has been hotly debated this year among bioethicists and in Congress.
<br>
Critics say the company is releasing the story not because they've performed groundbreaking science, but to spin a story
<br>
that might get them additional funding.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think they're mainly trying to bring attention to the company and break down certain barriers so (embryonic cloning)
<br>
can occur in the future with less public attention and outrage,&quot; said Stuart Newman, a member of the Council for
<br>
Responsible Genetics.
<br>
<p>The company did not return phone calls.
<br>
<p>The research was published in the Journal of Regenerative Medicine. Despite the positive pitch of the company's press
<br>
release, several researchers have called the work a failure.
<br>
<p>Professor Ian Wilmut, of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland, dismissed Advanced Cell's research as
<br>
&quot;irrelevant,&quot; in The Independent newspaper of London.
<br>
<p>&quot;Frankly, the fact that the company is announcing this now suggests it needs the publicity for refinancing,&quot; he was
<br>
quoted as saying.
<br>
<p>The researchers at Advanced Cell used two techniques similar to the &quot;nuclear transfer&quot; technology Wilmut used to clone
<br>
Dolly the sheep.
<br>
<p>Nuclear transfer involves taking the nucleus of an adult cell and placing it inside an egg from which the nucleus has
<br>
been removed.
<br>
<p>But Advanced Cell's embryo developed into only six cells. Wilmut said that even a nucleus removed from an unfertilized
<br>
egg would develop into the six-cell stage without adding the nucleus of an adult cell.
<br>
<p>&quot;The fact that it did not develop beyond six cells suggests it is fairly lightweight research,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Glenn McGee, who once sat on the company's ethics board called the announcement &quot;nothing but hype.&quot;
<br>
<p>He said the company's report lacks any significant details, including what cells company scientists actually grew from
<br>
the cloned embryo.
<br>
<p>&quot;They are doing science by press release,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>The researchers at Advanced Cell say they do not intend to create a new human being through cloning, but to perform
<br>
&quot;therapeutic cloning.&quot; Therapeutic cloning starts with controversial stem cells. Researchers believe they could one day
<br>
replace dead cells, such as neurons or spinal cord cells, to heal people who are injured or suffer from certain
<br>
diseases.
<br>
<p>The most flexible type of stem cells are taken from embryos, which are destroyed in the process, a fact that has ignited
<br>
heated ethical debate among legislators and scientists, some who believe an embryo is a human life.
<br>
<p>Researchers say embryonic cloning would eliminate the biological rejection that could occur by transplanting stem cells
<br>
into patients from a mismatched donor.
<br>
<p>Today the research is legal in the United States, but that could change.
<br>
<p>The House voted in August to make it a federal crime to clone human embryos for scientific research. The legislation is
<br>
expected to go to the Senate in March.
<br>
<p>The legislation, written by Rep. Dave Weldon (R-Florida), would set fines of $1 million or more and up to 10 years in
<br>
prison for violators.
<br>
<p>Several states have banned reproductive cloning.
<br>
<p>Great Britain began to rush emergency legislation to ban human cloning through the House of Lords on Monday.
<br>
<p>The laws were written to close a legal loophole in Britain after the high court ruled last week that cloning humans was
<br>
not illegal.
<br>
<p>Advanced Cell's research wouldn't have fallen under the law, but the legislation could hinder the efforts of rogue
<br>
researchers like Italian embryologist Severino Antinori, who has claimed he will clone humans for reproduction.
