</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I take the A&amp;G side here, partially - sentient entities, whether copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or naturally evolved ones, have rights insofar as they recognize and cherish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rights of other entities.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I do not quite take the position Robert suggests. 
<br>
<p>First, if a simulated being begs for or at least desires its continued
<br>
existence, my view is that it is expressing its right to life, and I am
<br>
not ethically allowed to erase it - even if that simulated being is
<br>
isomorphic to me. On the other hand, if that being accepts the
<br>
situation, then there is no ethical conflict at all. Now, since I
<br>
largely think (at least right now, when I am not in the simulation!)
<br>
that I would accept an isomorphic copy of me as equal in value and a
<br>
continuation of the Anders thread, it seems that both me outside the
<br>
simulation and me inside would be content with the simulate-and-erase
<br>
scheme, at least if the copy did not have the time for significant
<br>
divergence. But person X, who happens to have a different view of what
<br>
constitutes X-ness and how to define himself, would not come to the same
<br>
conclusions about the acceptability and would be morally obliged not to
<br>
terminate the simulation (or refrain from it). 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If a copy (and by extension the original),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes that the existence of a self aware entity may only be terminated if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entity agrees to it (without duress), or if the entity is willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disregard a life-wish (=the entity is immoral and therefore has no rights),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you may not terminate it. This is an innocent person. However, if your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy believes that destroying innocent entities is acceptable, then this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy is immoral, and may be terminated. In other words, if you think its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong to kill others, then it's to kill you. If you believe that it's OK to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill others, then it's OK for others to kill you. If I made a copy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself, I would be prohibited from killing it, because I (and my copies)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe you may not kill innocent others. If you make a copy of yourself, (a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy that believes that it is OK to kill copies), then you may kill it. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more thorny issue is whether it's OK to kill you, and personally I think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be wrong - since you kill only guilty entities, copies which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to kill, then you are not any more culpable than a hangman,  who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kills guilty persons. But then, if a copy escaped and managed to kill you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be also blameless.  This is based on the old Kantian reciprocity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a little twist to it.
</em><br>
<p>I still can't come to grips with your view that it is OK to destroy
<br>
entities that disregard the life-wish of others even when they are no
<br>
threats to you. It seems somewhat inconsistent: you respect the
<br>
life-wish of everyone - regardless of their mental states - except a
<br>
certain subset defined by their ethics. But that is a limited respect of
<br>
the life-wish (after all, even those ignoring it in others have it
<br>
themselves), if it was extended further you would yourself fall into the
<br>
category of people whose life-wish should not be respected. In fact, it
<br>
is not obvious that you are already in that category. Would you respect
<br>
the life-wish of someone who respected the life-wish of everybody,
<br>
except the life-wish of some small ethical subset like (say)
<br>
scientologists? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, if are in a simulation, your ability to enforce your morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be limited but this is a technical, not ethical problem.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. This is about what is *right* to do, not what we can do.
