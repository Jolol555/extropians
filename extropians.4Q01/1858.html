<br>
&lt;William Pierce, the hardcore NeoNazi, once wrote that the Jews are people
<br>
farmers.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stirling, in one of his superb Draka novels has one of the delicously evil
<br>
protagonists saying to their bodyslave
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sweetlin, yo' a serf, I'm a Draka. Serfs farm the land, and we farm yo'&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;The difference of course, is that Pierce's ZOG doesn't have all the guns,
<br>
and a firm hand on the whip.  Any American who spends time watching
<br>
the &quot;Jew-dominated outlets of mass media&quot;(tongue firmly in cheek)
<br>
deserves to end up like the lemming they are!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;However, he definitely has a point about people farming with respect to
<br>
how
<br>
our govt is run, and I supppose how govt's have always been run, except in
<br>
certain uncommon periods and places.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis all that can be said about our Elites is that they
<br>
are
<br>
arguably less violent with regards to their stock, and that they don't have
<br>
to be because they are much more skilled liars.  :::shrug:::
<br>
<p>&lt;We are being farmed, people. Many people, when confronted with these facts,
<br>
just say, &quot;well, some people are farmed, other are farmers. I plan on being
<br>
a farmer.&quot;
<br>
Well, that's nice, but the lottery has neever favored the player.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah but the lottery has only a few winners relative to the players.
<br>
The Game of Life has fewer winners than players, but the relative
<br>
spread is much less.  I would also point out at this juncture that
<br>
many of the &quot;ZOG Overlords&quot; (lol) probably made the same call
<br>
here. &quot;Oh Vey! Well somebody's got take their money... !&quot;.
<br>
Given the general mental involvement of the masses why blame
<br>
the Jews for chosing to be farmers, rather than the farmed?
<br>
<p><p>regards,
<br>
Brian
