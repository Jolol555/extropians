<p><p>As you are probably aware, VCSELs are the basis of inter-chassis
<br>
<p>connections in modern core internet routers. Today's VCSELs can be used 
<br>
at 2.5Ghz in current designs. This is for real products, not just
<br>
lab stuff. Faster lasers are vastly more expensive and are used
<br>
for long-haul fiber. the current &quot;standard&quot; device has 12 vcsels
<br>
and a fiber connector that connects to 12 fibers for a total of
<br>
30Gbps.
<br>
<p><p>Several companies are working on a neat new VCSEL device: four
<br>
VCSELs of slightly different wavelengths mounted in a package that
<br>
directs them into the same fiber. multiple wavelengths per fiber is
<br>
is called &quot;wavelength division multiplexing&quot; or WDM. This low-cost 
<br>
version is called coarse WDM, or CWDM. This puts 10Gbps into one fiber
<br>
fairly cheaply. This is the proposed standard for 10Gig-e, which
<br>
is the latest generation of ethernet. You can design products using
<br>
this technology now. It's not just in the lab. The 4-VCSEL/1 fiber
<br>
arrangement is market-driven by 10Gig-e, not by any particular
<br>
technical constraint. I anticipate that within a year we will see
<br>
denser versions with 16 or 32 VCSELS/fiber. Note that dense and
<br>
ultra-dense DWDM and UWDM systems are already used for long-haul,
<br>
but these are hand-built from expensive parts bulky parts, not
<br>
mass-produced VCSEL devices.
<br>
<p><p>For the last several years, the rate of improvement for data
<br>
transmission (dollars/bps) has substantially outpaced the rate
<br>
of improvement for computing, which itself is improving. This in
<br>
turn reduces the penalties associated with massively parallel
<br>
computing.
