</em><br>
<p>My thoughts exactly.  &quot;Hello, Greenpeace?  How'd you like to help put
<br>
one of the major industrial causes of pollution out of business
<br>
permanently?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We're also going to need a new term for 'worldwide' aren't we?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Say....systemwide, er...um...? Has anyone thought of the DNS system for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off-world web sites yet?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Interplanetary Internet&quot;.  Look it up on NASA's Web site.  .mars and
<br>
.moon have been suggested, with more than three letters to emphasize
<br>
that they are neither TLD nor country code (with the most practical
<br>
everyday aspect being to expect extra latency).
<br>
<p>Let's just say I concur re: getting huge chunks of metal down *now* as
<br>
opposed to waiting for nanotech to mature...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *why doesn't someone find a heap of gold out on those asteroids. Good ol'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greed'd get'em movin'*
</em><br>
<p>I believe some of the M (for Metal) type asteroids have, indeed, been
<br>
estimated to have huge amounts of gold.  By &quot;huge&quot;, I mean &quot;of similar
<br>
or greater mass than the sum total of said metal humans have dredged up
<br>
in the history of said species&quot;.  I definitely remember that
<br>
description applied to the amount of stainless steel in one M type
<br>
asteroid.  And these are M type asteroids that, at their closest, pass
<br>
closer to the Earth than the Moon itself.  It is at least theoretically
<br>
possible to decelerate these things into medium-to-low Earth orbit,
<br>
where they could be mined for raw wealth and scientific data.
<br>
<p>Can you say &quot;ka-CHING!&quot;?  ^_^
<br>
<p>There are, as always, problems.  The first and perhaps biggest is
<br>
launch costs.  $10K/pound to get stuff into orbit is not that far from
<br>
the cost of gold to begin with, no?  Yet that's about the current
<br>
costs, and only a fraction of that mass can be used to get stuff into
<br>
Earth orbit, or even to put it into a controlled drop onto Earth's
<br>
surface.  So, step 1 must be to reduce these costs drastically.
<br>
There's reasons why current launchers haven't, but other parties (like
<br>
XCOR) are developing launch tech so they can reduce the costs.
