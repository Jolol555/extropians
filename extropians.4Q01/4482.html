On Sun, 16 Dec 2001, Amara Graps reflected on &quot;reasonable&quot; ways
<br>
of converging meme-sets.  I'll comment on a few comments:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The notion of 'Converting a meme-set' is completely against my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics and as coersive as I can imagine. If you think of an idea as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a seed that germinates and grows, then either a person has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal 'soil' where that seed will germinate, or he/she doesn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip] If that person likes the idea then they'll return to you with questions.
</em><br>
<p>Amara, on a fair and level playing field I would agree with you.
<br>
However I think the question becomes *how* to get it to that state.
<br>
Certainly Western ideas have dominated for the last century or so.
<br>
But the battles in terms of unequal education for women or denying
<br>
access to &quot;open&quot; information sources (be they in the Muslim or
<br>
former Communist world) are not serving the purposes of allowing
<br>
seeds to find their ground and grow.
<br>
<p>Read this long article in the NY Times about the situation in Uzbekistan:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/16/magazine/16UZBEK.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/16/magazine/16UZBEK.html</a>
<br>
<p>A *very* scary article (in terms of the extreme measures being
<br>
taken by the government) -- at the same time *equally* as scarey
<br>
with regard to the &quot;brain-washing&quot; being done at Wahhabi supported
<br>
Mosques or Madrassas.
<br>
<p>Here is a &quot;concrete&quot; question -- can one have an &quot;informed&quot;
<br>
debate, or a field on which seeds can grow, *if* the agenda
<br>
of the opponent is to (a) prevent the education and promote
<br>
the subjugation of 50% of of the population?; and (b) prevent
<br>
the exposure to alternate information sources such as radio
<br>
or TV?
<br>
<p>*That* is how I read the article.  So you must claim that
<br>
the article is inaccurate; or seeds should be planted on
<br>
biased (infertile ground) [what a waste of time for a rational
<br>
indiviual]; or claim that &quot;just&quot; seeds *should* have to
<br>
triumph over inhospitable conditions.  (Otherwise it would
<br>
make sense to eliminate irrational or biased environents
<br>
from seed dispersal.)
<br>
<p>Mind you, I have no argument against the Sufi presentation of
<br>
ideas and concepts.  It seems not *too* different from that
<br>
which I have experienced in various courses and seminars
<br>
that I took in the early 1980's (quite unrelated to Sufi-ism).
<br>
Going back to the &quot;real&quot; definitions of things, it seems to
<br>
serve as a useful &quot;grounding&quot; perspective.
<br>
