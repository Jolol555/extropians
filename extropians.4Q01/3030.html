<p>I don't know, I've thought about Pearl Harbor, WTC and far more
<br>
horrific events a fair bit.
<br>
<p>The US carried out terrorist acts against American Indians for
<br>
well over a century.  I'm sure that a number of these, considered
<br>
individually, were remotely close to WTC, perhaps even worse.
<br>
<p>I suspect many other US actions in this past century would also
<br>
measure up to WTC, particularly actions in the Philippines, assorted
<br>
Central American and Caribbean countries, and Vietnam.
<br>
<p>Although not a single, direct action, US policy has caused more
<br>
damage in Columbia alone than the US has experienced from all
<br>
terrorist actions to date.
<br>
<p>Regarding the subject line:  if the US and friends were to attempt
<br>
to mold the Afghan polity, I suggest Switzerland's model has more
<br>
to offer than does a strong central government.
