<a href="http://www.sustainableenergy.org/resources/technologies/industry.htm">http://www.sustainableenergy.org/resources/technologies/industry.htm</a> is,

<p>Residential and vehicular use is remarkably dirty power -- this is the key

factor.  Emission. Photovoltaics and solar hydrogen are zero emission

within the operation cycle. Methanol is virtually zero emission (CO2 is

not a pollutant).

<p><em>&gt; production, and distribution of the products that each and every

<p>While hydrogen surplus can be stored and transported over wide areas, it

is industry's problem to meet their demands, and it is secondary in

<p>Um, here's one: <a href="http://www.ise.fhg.de/Projects/ES/ES_english.html">http://www.ise.fhg.de/Projects/ES/ES_english.html</a> I'm not
<br>
saying it's currently economically feasible, but this wasn't the gist of
<br>
the original argument. The original point is whether a human family can
<br>
sustainablyl exist on an energy flux existing over their property. This of
<br>
course doesn't include vehicular use and the energy trapped in the
<br>
materials passing throught the household (which can be partially
<br>
recaptured via thermal utilization of waste). These requirements are not
<br>
constant, but limited by our technology (brain in a vat, computronium as

habitat, etc).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; individual in debt for their lifetime paying the energy cost of

</em><br>
<p>Energy costs for the materials are usually not included into the

operational energy balance. It was not the point of the original argument.
<br>
This having said, it depends on the longevity of the construction, the
<br>
type of the materials, and the industrial processes used for its creation,
<br>
considering the release of emission and the input of energy (whether
<br>
fossil, or renewable). It is a different problem, and imo a lesser
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is also for this reason that further advances in consumption

</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone much farther than the homeowner in investing in efficiency.
</em><br>
<p>Then, we should start with the homeowners, and the vehicular sector. Here
<br>
there is still good potential for enhancements.
