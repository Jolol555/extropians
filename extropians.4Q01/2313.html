<p><em>&gt; Where have I heard the name Barry Bloom before?

<p>The article, quoting Bloom:
<br>
&quot;How do you keep new bioweapons from happening?&quot; Bloom said. &quot;You have
<br>
to ... create a very strong moral culture of scientists that worry
<br>
about the uses of science.&quot;
<br>
<p>Biologists have something to learn from psychologists, political
<br>
scientists and game theorists, it seems. The 'moral culture' argument
<br>
is a weak one. If we understood memetics well enough to reach a
<br>
sleeper agent sitting in on a mol bio class, we'd be living in a world
<br>
almost as different from ours as nanotopia or AItopia would
<br>
be. Compare:
<br>
<p>&quot;How do you keep airplanes from being plowed into buildings? You have
<br>
to create a very strong moral culture of pilots that worry about the
<br>
uses of airplanes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Or for that matter, many schools of martial arts are already
<br>
thoroughly infused with a moral culture-- a pacifist one in
<br>
fact. Which does nothing to prevent strictly hands-on dojos from
<br>
arising... and nothing to prevent students who don't care about the
<br>
moral and spiritual dimensions of martial arts (or already have their
<br>
own, non-pacifist moral schemae) from enrolling. Among these students
<br>
were Atta and his gang of murderers.
<br>
<p>Moral indoctrination only works on individuals who are willing or
<br>
susceptible to it. Any dangerous information that moral indoctrination
<br>
is joined to can be just as easily be separated from it. Information
<br>
is annoying like that.

<br>

<br>
