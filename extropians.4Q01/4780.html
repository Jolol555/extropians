</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist act that makes you support this type of action; is it just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horrific scale of the fatalities, or something else?
</em><br>
<p>The Geneva Conventions do not treat domestic insurgencies of a country
<br>
by its own citizens (although there is a bit of fuzziness if those
<br>
citizens are being funded and supported by a foreign power) as something
<br>
covered by the Conventions. They are there to govern conflicts between
<br>
nations, not within them. Civil conflict within a country was apparently
<br>
regarded as an 'internal matter' that does not fall under the perview of
<br>
international law.
<br>
<p>For this reason, the 9-11 attacks are covered under the Conventions, but
<br>
domestic terrorism like McVeigh's acts are not. As we know, the 9-11
<br>
acts were committed by non-citizens who had infiltrated our country from
<br>
abroad, given orders by state sponsored groups in other countries, and
<br>
given financial support and training by the same groups. For this
<br>
reason, the events of 9-11 are acts of war, while McVeigh's actions were
<br>
acts of civil rebellion. They are no less severe, but because of the
<br>
circumstances, they are treated differently in a legal setting.
<br>
<p>However, despite that, if you ask the FBI, the primary profile for a
<br>
domestic terrorist today is a lone white male, and if you follow the
<br>
agenda of the liberals here, the white male is certainly the enemy.
