<p>
<em>&gt; In a world where all material items (except fixed land resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on) can be had simply by asking the local nanobots to dig
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up the pattern and produce it, what exactly would property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights apply to and why would you care?
</em><br>
<p>Last time I checked, nanotech doesn't get around conservation of
<br>
mass-energy, so property rights are no less useful when everyone
<br>
on the planet is a billionaire than now.  The total amount of
<br>
resources remains the same--the amount of solar energy the planet
<br>
can harness.  It's only the efficiency with which we can use it
<br>
that will grow exponentially.  When we move out into the galaxy,
<br>
then the pool expands even more, but it's still a fixed pool,
<br>
and humans will disagree about how to use those resources--indeed
<br>
there will be even more disagreement than there is now, because
<br>
there will be more people with different desires, and more /kinds/
<br>
of people (AI, etc.) with desires we can't even imagine now.
<br>
<p>Just because it's harder for humans to visualize the difference
<br>
between 1 and 2 billion than to visualize the difference between
<br>
1 and 2 hundred doesn't mean the difference doesn't exist.  As I've
<br>
said before, when everyone on the planet is a billionaire, the guy
<br>
with 10 billion still gets the girl, the bigger spaceship, the
<br>
asteroid in the better neighborhood, and the nicer toys.  &quot;Scarcity&quot;
<br>
is a relative thing.
