<em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20When%20is%20an%20MP3%20like%20a%20lighthouse?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200110251748.KAA06607@well.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The law is powerless.  Artists are powerless.  The opinions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Napster generation are the only opinions that matter, because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determine how much the artist gets paid.
</em><br>
<p>Amusing, but not particularly accurate. Although I'll admit that
<br>
this wholesale theft thing will force them to rethink their revenue
<br>
streams.
<br>
<p>One option is that some artists may stop releasing recordings
<br>
period, and make their money from live performances only, or
<br>
primarily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I am speaking about total wealth in the system, not the wealth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any single party.
</em><br>
<p>If I am an artist about to release my new hit album &quot;extropian love
<br>
dance&quot; and almost immediately the album is stolen and distributed
<br>
via the net. I've lost revenue and since no one else paid for
<br>
squat, the total wealth generated is a fraction of what it could
<br>
have been.
<br>
<p>Total wealth decreased.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your argument translates to &quot;stealing increases wealth&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Copying increases wealth.  If someone steals my television set, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lost a television set and they gained a television set, so the net
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect is zero except for unfairness costs.  If someone copies my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;television set, I lose nothing, and the copier gains a television
</em><br>
<em>&gt;set.  If the copier doesn't tip the TV set designer a couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bucks, I lose because I'm less likely to be able to buy (copy)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(download) better TV sets in the future.  But the TV set designer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has not actually lost money; they simply have not received a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gain to which you would argue they are legally entitled.  Real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wealth has increased, but so has unfairness.
</em><br>
<p>The T.V set designer has most certainly lost money and the total
<br>
wealth created was less.
<br>
<p>If you copy a dollar bill you do not have two dollar bills.
<br>
<p>If I produce an idea/song/work of art for sale and the item is
<br>
ripped off and I do not get paid, the total wealth created is
<br>
dramatically less no matter how many copies there are.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;To put it another way, suppose that someone copies a TV set.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sure that you would argue that the law says that the copier has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just stolen $400 from the TV designer.  Leaving aside the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unenforceability of the law, wealth has *still* been created. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let's say you're the TV designer.  If I freeload a TV, it's as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a magic fairy were to give you $400 of new wealth, after which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;steal $400 from you.  At the end of the day you are no richer, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have my stolen goods at no benefit to you, but $400 of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wealth has still entered the system from *somewhere*.  You can, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you want, phrase the situation so that the real wealth was created
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at the artist's node and then stolen by the evil freeloader, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the point is that each additional download of a TV set *still*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creates an additional $400 of new wealth.
</em><br>
<p>You have stolen $400 in value from the designer/manufacturer of the
<br>
T.V. It was created, then immediately stolen. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And you are, of course, wrong *in practice* to call it &quot;theft&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because in practice, the only way for artists to be paid is for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;downloaders to decide to pay them.  You do not use the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;theft&quot; to a downloader; that word does not correspond to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intuitive perception of the situation.  You use the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;freeloader&quot;, so that they see the justice of your argument and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree to tip.
</em><br>
<p>No, the use of theft is appropriate and you prosecute them where
<br>
possible, and brand them as thieves where not.
<br>
<p>Their &quot;intuitive perception&quot; of the situation is nothing more than
<br>
a cheap attempt to justify the theft.
<br>
<p>You continue to call them thieves and let their conscience (the
<br>
ones who have one) gnaw at them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I agree, it doesn't.  Copying valuable material translates to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increase in wealth.  Arguably this is offset by unfairness costs. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Arguably it is not.
</em><br>
<p>Illegally copying valuable material amounts to immediate theft of
<br>
any value created.
