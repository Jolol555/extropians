</em><br>
<p>Well, I haven't seen anything lately that I feel is contemptible enough to 
<br>
deal with in an authoritarian manner.  Also, no one has contacted me 
<br>
directly regarding any extraneous offence that has been dished out.  I 
<br>
would rather not have to &quot;enforce&quot; anything, and as has been the case in 
<br>
the past (both recent and more distant), a spontaneous order of sorts has 
<br>
always sorted things out in the long run.  Threads about improving the list 
<br>
pop up a few times each year, but the general consensus has always been 
<br>
that the current method (hands off except for in extreme circumstances such 
<br>
as the gun discussion moratorium in '99) is the best.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;The responsibility for the destruction of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;reputation of ExI, and of the list and all its
</em><br>
<em> &gt;participants does not, however, rest with John Clark,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;but with the list owners and their failure to insist
</em><br>
<em> &gt;on and enforce a standard of respect for the discourse
</em><br>
<em> &gt;in this forum.
</em><br>
<p>In the list rules (which I will send separately after this message), there 
<br>
is a disclaimer that &quot;...Extropy Institute does not take responsibility for 
<br>
the use or misuse of posts addressed to the extropians list.&quot;  While I am 
<br>
occasionally discouraged by the level of discussion on this list, I beg to 
<br>
differ that the reputation of ExI is being destroyed by the discourse on 
<br>
this list.  I don't see that as being the case at all; please let me know 
<br>
how you feel this has been done.
<br>
<p>The bottom line is this: am I happy that there have been ad hominem attacks 
<br>
on this list over the past few days?  No, I'm not happy about it at 
<br>
all.  However, I've paid close attention to the threads as they have 
<br>
progressed and don't feel that they need any administrative force 
<br>
applied.  For the record, the administrative process would be this: I would 
<br>
find (via forwarded complaint, offensive post etc.) something I felt to be 
<br>
an issue of concern.  I would then forward that to Max More so that he (and 
<br>
the board of Directors as well as VP Greg Burch) could determine whether or 
<br>
not action should be taken.  Those measures would then be carried out.
<br>
<p>If anyone has an issue with the way I have done my job, please let Max and 
<br>
I know.
