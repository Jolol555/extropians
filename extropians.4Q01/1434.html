Artificial intelligence reaches the ear
<br>
<a href="http://www.idgnet.co.nz/pressroom.nsf/UNID/3D45237D5C38E241CC256AE90068729D!op">http://www.idgnet.co.nz/pressroom.nsf/UNID/3D45237D5C38E241CC256AE90068729D!op</a>

<br>
<p>Oticon New Zealand has launched the first &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; hearing
<br>
aid that works like a brain.
<br>
<p>Adapto(tm) is a hearing aid that understands people, containing a host of
<br>
cutting-edge software including voice-activation.
<br>
<p>&quot;For those familiar with voice-activated mobiles and speech recognition
<br>
computer software, Oticon's Adapto(tm) may sound quite simple,&quot; says
<br>
audiologist and Oticon NZ General Manager, Karen Pullar. &quot;Behind this apparent
<br>
simplicity lies months of high-tech international research to produce the
<br>
millennium's breakthrough in hearing care.&quot;
<br>
<p>Adapto(tm) software not only recognises, but prioritises human speech signals
<br>
over other sounds in the environment.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is exactly what the brain does in people with normal hearing, enabling
<br>
us to avoid listening fatigue by canceling out non-speech sounds,&quot; she said.
<br>
&quot;Adapto automatically adapts to its surroundings and, unlike traditional
<br>
digital hearing aids, is programmed to reflect the aspirations, lifestyle and
<br>
preferences of each individual.&quot;
<br>
<p>Several advanced audiological features mean that for the first time, hearing
<br>
aid users can experience completely natural sound without occlusion - that
<br>
&quot;speaking in a barrel&quot; effect.
<br>
<p>&quot;We find that many hearing aid users are uncomfortable with the unnatural
<br>
sound effect of their own voice, or when chewing. Adapto(tm) overcomes this
<br>
with a dynamic feedback cancellation system that does not compromise
<br>
audibility or speech understanding,&quot; said Ms Pullar.
<br>
<p>Further software advances mean a radical new fitting programme for hearing
<br>
care professionals. Genie is the programme that totally personalises every
<br>
fitting, allowing for an unheard-of range of variables to be incorporated,
<br>
such as prior hearing aid experience, age, lifestyle and audiogram.
<br>
<p>Ms Pullar says that many of New Zealand's 450,000 hearing impaired people will
<br>
benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution in hearing care.
<br>
<p>&quot;This will be of interest to people who wear their hearing aids behind or
<br>
inside their ears,&quot; she said.
<br>
<p>New Zealand trials are set to begin in November, followed by customised
<br>
training offered to all hearing care clinics.
<br>
<p>&quot;We aim to complete our trials and training before making Adapto(tm) widely
<br>
available from February 2002,&quot; said Ms Pullar.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
