<em>&gt; &gt; One final thing: There is absolutely no point in buying said NBC

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; travel: keep your pressure suit with you at all times, you never know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when a blowout will occur. Same rule applies with chemwarfare: carry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your gasmask with you in your handbag, backpack, or briefcase at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; times: in your car, at work, to the gym.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When exactly would you put it on?  With bio attacks there seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no hint of exposure until several days later.  And with chem attacks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the agents work by skin contact, so the mask wouldn't help, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if you do carry a gas mask in your backpack, when do you open it up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and put the mask on?
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you are really paranoid, do it every time a plane passes over.
<br>
;)
<br>
<p>Actually, if a crop duster flies overhead spewing out stuff in an area
<br>
where there are no crops worth dusting, that is pretty damn good
<br>
indication.
<br>
<p>Also: in my previous post (not the one you replied to), I noted that
<br>
there are a number of sensors you can obtain that will alert you to the
<br>
presence of such toxins or bioagents.
<br>
<p>The primary purpose of a gasmask in the event of bioattack is to allow
<br>
you to a) help those visibly exposed without getting infected, and b) if
<br>
you are infected, it helps limit your ability to pass on the agent to
<br>
others from breathing or expectorating until you can be treated under
<br>
isolated conditions.
<br>
<p>Now, if carrying one around is not your bag of tea, and you do have
<br>
spare cash lying around, you can't go far wrong to have one at home, one
<br>
in the car, and one in the office. That way you have pretty good access
<br>
to one without having to carry it. I'm sure in many areas you would be
<br>
treated as a wierdo or a potential attacker if you walked around with a
<br>
gasmask all the time....
