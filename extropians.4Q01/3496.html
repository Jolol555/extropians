<em>&gt;From: &quot;Pat Fallon&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:pfallon@ptd.net?Subject=Re:%20terrorism,%20what%20is%20and%20what%20should%20never%20be&In-Reply-To=&lt;200111281445.GAA13967@well.com&gt;">pfallon@ptd.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Some thoughts on the subject of terrorism, for what it's worth.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I think it is very important to understand why we were attacked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Understanding why someone attacked you may help you avoid a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;similar situation in the future, for one thing.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;the rest of a long post distilled down to one sentence&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;Give the terrorists what they want and they won't be terrorists
<br>
anymore.&quot;
<br>
<p>Not going to happen.
<br>
<p>We know what the terrorists want, and they are not going to get it.
<br>
<p>The first thing they want is for us/U.S to stop supporting Israel,
<br>
so they can try/fail again to destroy it, and that is not going to
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>The rest of your points have already been discussed here ad
<br>
nauseam.
<br>
<p>Samantha and Olga will agree with you, and the usual suspects will
<br>
disagree.
<br>
<p>What the terrorists are going to get is dead.
