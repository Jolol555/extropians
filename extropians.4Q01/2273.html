<em>&gt; &gt; While at bottom this seems to be just a semantic dispute about what an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;experience&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I think it's about whether one wants to believe in the supernatural, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be necessary in order to conclude that experience can exist without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensory phenomena of any kind whatsoever, no matter how small or weak. It can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be turned into a semantic dispute only if we define the terms in other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their dictionary meanings....
</em><br>
<p>Any argument that relies on a dictionary doesn't really merit much
<br>
respect, but I'll take the bait anyway.  I think we're tallking about
<br>
the third sense of the word &quot;experience&quot; you list here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3 a : the conscious events that make up an individual life b : the events that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make up the conscious past of a community or nation or mankind generally
</em><br>
<p>While I certainly agree that the vast majority of these events are
<br>
sensory, there is no more reason to believe they _all_ are without
<br>
exception than there is to believe that every memory location in a
<br>
computer has a value that came from some input port.  Yes, probably
<br>
the vast majority of them did.  But some of them were copied from
<br>
ROM (built-in concepts), some of them had totally random values from
<br>
startup (I assume neurons can have random values as well, since their
<br>
function is based on randomly-bouncing ions), and some have values
<br>
calculated by chaotic processes that can't possibly be predicted
<br>
from inputs or associated with particular inputs.  To claim that
<br>
this view is &quot;supernatural&quot; is nonsense.  Senses exist; mental
<br>
processes exist; to dogmatically assume that one is the only
<br>
source of the other, which is a fabulously complex process we are
<br>
only just beginning to understand, is totally unjustified,
<br>
