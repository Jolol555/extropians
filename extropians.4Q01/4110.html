<p>The philosophy of &quot;Sticks and stones can break my bones but names will never hurt me.&quot; was taught to me as a child and I have carried this phrase, neatly tucked in my pocket, throughout my adult life.  But being too proud can easily trip us.
<br>
<p>Certainly this sentiment is not novel, or even unique. 
<br>
<p>It is my responsibility to exclude people from my life who intentionally or subconsciously say things to me or about me that are rude.  It is also my responsibility to do something about it.  How one takes actions speak a hell of a lot louder than the feebleminded words of someone whose intention is to attempt to lash out and defame.  “Turn the other cheek” is another phrase told to me as a child.  I’d rather not have two bruised cheeks -&amp;#61514;
<br>
<p>I personally think that everyone can be hurt by harsh and meanspirited words.  I can think of ways to put this theory to practice, but why stoop to intentionally trying to hurt someone by finding out something that can get his or her goat. Take a moment with your self and find your sacred cow.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Bullies, like animals, sense fear, and you must stand your ground.&quot; &quot;Sticks and stone may break my bones, but words can never hurt me,&quot; was never bullied -- nor has a very short memory.

<p>To laugh often and much, to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends, to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
<br>
Ralph Waldo Emerson
<br>
<p>A free life cannot acquire many possessions, because this is not easy to do without servility to mobs or monarchs.
<br>
Epicurus (341-270 B.C.)

<br>

<br>

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
<br>
<p>The price paid for intellectual pacification is the sacrifice of the entire moral courage of the human mind.
<br>
John Stuart Mill
<br>
<p>Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as to make eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to break through that tyranny, that people should be eccentric. Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigor, moral courage. That so few now dare to be eccentric marks the chief danger of the time.
<br>
John Stuart Mill
<br>
<p>There is only one rule for being a good talker…learn to listen.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;No man is justified in doing evil on the grounds of expedience.
<br>
Theodore Roosevelt
<br>
<p>To endure is the first thing that a child ought to learn, and that which he will have the most need to know.
<br>

<br>
<p>Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric.
<br>
Bertrand Russell
<br>
<p>You know you’ve achieved perfection in design, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away.
<br>
Antoine de Saint-Exupery
<br>
<p>Everything has been figured out, except how to live.
<br>

<br>
<p>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
<br>
George Bernard Shaw
<br>
<p>Let him who would move the world first move himself.
<br>
Socrates
<br>
<p>It takes two to speak truth – One to speak, and another to hear.
<br>
Henry David Thoreau
<br>
<p>Our judgments judge us, and nothing reveals us, exposes our weaknesses, more ingeniously than the attitude of pronouncing upon our fellows.
<br>
Paul Valery

<br>
<p>New and stirring things are belittled because if they are not belittled, the humiliating question arises, ‘Why then are you not taking part in them?’
<br>
