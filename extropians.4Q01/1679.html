<em>&gt; I never said everything that was illegal was wrong, but I clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do feel that way about copyrights. 
</em><br>
<p>Obviously.  But you still haven't said _why_.  I'm genuinely
<br>
interested.  I like hearing opposing arguments that have some
<br>
substance, because they are so rare.  Robert Bradbury mentioned
<br>
the lack of ability for investors to get return on highly
<br>
speculative research.  That's an argument with substance, and
<br>
in fact one of the hardest to counter.  I happen to think that
<br>
removing patents will shift technology development more toward
<br>
small, incremental improvements and craftsmanship and away from
<br>
&quot;creative&quot; invention, and that that's not such a bad thing.
<br>
But at least I recognize that the opposing argument is a good
<br>
one, and that I am obliged to counter it with substantive
<br>
argument of my own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You don't believe that, and using that to justify your refusal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;look at your ethical position on copyright is dishonest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cowardly. Don't hide behind the law--tell us what you think is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;actually right and wrong; and back up your opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dishonest? Cowardly?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; End of discussion.
</em><br>
<p>How else do you describe two messages with absolutely no content
<br>
other than &quot;this is illegal&quot;, &quot;this is theft&quot;.  If that's not
<br>
hiding behind the law as an excuse for ehtical judgment, I don't
<br>
know what is.
