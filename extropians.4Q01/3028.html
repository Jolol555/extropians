<br>
WELCOME FROM EXTROPY INSTITUTE PRESIDENT MAX MORE
<br>
<p>Welcome to the Extropians List! This List has hosted innovative discussions 
<br>
on the Internet continuously since 1991. We welcome innovative discussions 
<br>
pertaining to scientific, technological, philosophical, artistic, economic, 
<br>
and social perspectives on the future.
<br>
If you are not familiar with extropian thinking, I suggest you read the 
<br>
posts for a while before you begin to post. You will gain an idea of how 
<br>
the list works, and see how the range of topics varies from week to week 
<br>
and month to month. If you read only one document to get an idea of the 
<br>
attitudes and values shared by extropians despite all their diversity, 
<br>
please read The Extropian Principles 3.0. You can find this at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm">http://www.extropy.org/extprn3.htm</a>
<br>
You will find many other essays, including the FAQ at Extropy Institute’s 
<br>
web site at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org">http://www.extropy.org</a>
<br>
Please be aware that the content of the extropians list does not 
<br>
automatically reflect the philosophy of Extropianism itself.  As with most 
<br>
mailing lists, it reflects opinions on various subjects and the posts 
<br>
therein should not be viewed as official endorsements of Extropy Institute 
<br>
or vice versa.
<br>
Please carefully read the List Rules below, followed by more information 
<br>
about the Extropians List.
<br>
Onward!
<br>
Max More
<br>
President, Extropy Institute

<br>
<p>L I S T R U L E S
<br>
We have a few rules about how you interact with the list. Your continued 
<br>
subscription indicates your acceptance of these rules. We do not like rules 
<br>
for their own sake. The List rules are just those we believe will keep the 
<br>
level of discussion high and polite.
<br>
<p>PERSONAL ATTACKS: We do not allow personal attacks or libelous statements. 
<br>
Those violating this rule may be removed from the List without notice.
<br>
<p>If someone attacks your character, insults you, or otherwise violates the 
<br>
above rule, do NOT retaliate in like manner. Instead, send us a complaint 
<br>
(to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20List%20Rules%20Part%202&In-Reply-To=&lt;5.1.0.14.0.20011122000843.029a36c0@pop.earthlink.net&gt;">e_shaun@extropy.org</a>) and take the matter off-list.
<br>
<p>COPYRIGHT: It is a violation of our Rules and United States law to copy 
<br>
material from copyrighted sources and post them to the List. Short excerpts 
<br>
and summaries are fine. Repeated violators of this rule may be unsubscribed 
<br>
without notice.
<br>
<p>ADVERTISING: It is against our rules to advertise or solicit business 
<br>
without our permission. Many people online do not want to see solicitations 
<br>
and sales messages when they are trying to read a high-density discussion 
<br>
list. Certain kinds of solicitation may be permitted, but our permission 
<br>
must first be obtained. Violation of this rule may result in termination of 
<br>
your subscription. [Personal professional announcements or discussion of 
<br>
personal professional activities are appropriate to the list, if they 
<br>
generally relate to the over-all subject matter discussed there.]
<br>
<p>This is a private forum. We reserve the right to unsubscribe anyone at any 
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation in making the Extropians List a stimulating 
<br>
and enjoyable forum.

<br>
<p>ABOUT THE EXTROPIANS LIST: UNSUBSCRIBING, ADMINISTRATION, POSTING PROTOCOL.
<br>
<p>If you post to the Extropians List, you must anticipate that your writing 
<br>
might be forwarded to another list or to particular individuals. Postings 
<br>
will appear in a publicly-accessible archive at the following URL: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians</a>.  Please be aware that Extropy 
<br>
Institute does not take responsibility for the use or misuse of posts 
<br>
addressed to the extropians list.
<br>
<p>1)      Formal complaints and administrative requests should be sent to:
<br>
&lt;<a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20List%20Rules%20Part%202&In-Reply-To=&lt;5.1.0.14.0.20011122000843.029a36c0@pop.earthlink.net&gt;">e_shaun@extropy.org</a>&gt; (except sub and unsub requests, which go to 
<br>
&lt;<a href="mailto:majordomo@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20List%20Rules%20Part%202&In-Reply-To=&lt;5.1.0.14.0.20011122000843.029a36c0@pop.earthlink.net&gt;">majordomo@extropy.org</a>&gt;)
<br>
2a) Mail to the list should be sent to:
<br>
&lt;<a href="mailto:extropians@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20List%20Rules%20Part%202&In-Reply-To=&lt;5.1.0.14.0.20011122000843.029a36c0@pop.earthlink.net&gt;">extropians@extropy.org</a>&gt;
<br>
2b) The software that processes traffic on the list alters the mail headers 
<br>
so that all correctly working mail readers will automatically address 
<br>
replies BACK to the LIST. [reply-to: <a href="mailto:extropians@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20List%20Rules%20Part%202&In-Reply-To=&lt;5.1.0.14.0.20011122000843.029a36c0@pop.earthlink.net&gt;">extropians@extropy.org</a>]
<br>
2c) If you want to reply to an individual poster you should manually 
<br>
address a reply. If the post does not have a signature line, viewing the 
<br>
message in a text editor should help you determine the sender’s address.
<br>
2d) It is strongly recommended but not required that all list members use a 
<br>
signature file containing their e-mail address.
<br>
3)      Due to the volume of list traffic please restrain yourself from 
<br>
over-quoting previous postsjust a couple of lines to re-cap for those who 
<br>
weren’t paying attention is usually sufficient.
<br>
4)      Traffic on this mailing list can run quite high. We like to keep 
<br>
the signal- to-noise ratio as high as we can, so please restrain the 
<br>
impulse to post “me-too” messages or ad hominem flames to the list at 
<br>
large. If you cannot resist engaging in such discourse, please do so in 
<br>
private e-mail.
<br>
<p>5)      Posts about the list, or its rules, should have the pre-fix “META:” 
<br>
We encourage the use of other prefixes indicating the content of a post. 
<br>
Examples include, PHIL:, MATH:, SCI:, CHAT:, etc.
<br>
<p>6)      History has proven that some topics which are occasionally 
<br>
introduced on the extropians list have been controversial enough to provoke 
<br>
long-lasting, heated exchanges.  The main topic of controversy in the 
<br>
recent past has been that of guns and gun rights, though there are other 
<br>
issues which have had a similar effect.  While it is Extropy Institute’s 
<br>
policy not to ban any topic, new members to this list should be forewarned 
<br>
as to the potential consequences of posting on this and other issues.  We 
<br>
once again encourage you to read the list for a while prior to posting.
<br>
<p>As long-time List member Hal Finney wrote:
<br>
“Extropianism is a philosophy of life. Max More, editor of Extropy, has 
<br>
identified five Extropian principles [referring to an earlier version of 
<br>
the Extropian Principles]:
<br>
·       Boundless Expansion
<br>
·       Self Transformation
<br>
·       Dynamic Optimism
<br>
·       Intelligent Technology
<br>
·       Spontaneous Order
<br>
<p>“You can see that the basic point is a belief that the future will allow 
<br>
virtually unlimited expansion in the possibilities for our own personal 
<br>
lives. Extropians reject limits imposed by outsiders on what we can do and 
<br>
what we can become. We embrace the future, with all of its awe-inspiring 
<br>
possibilities.
<br>
“[Referring to the reading list at the Extropy Institute website,] The role 
<br>
of [these] books is to show that these aren’t just idle musings and hopes, 
<br>
but are well-grounded expectations about what we are going to have to work 
<br>
with in the next century. Without having read those books, such 
<br>
common-place Extropian ideas as immortality or a world without governments 
<br>
might seem absurd.
<br>
“If you haven’t read these books but want to ask questions about these and 
<br>
other Extropian ideas, the problem is that the answer is usually going to 
<br>
be, first read the book. You can’t answer a question about the possibility 
<br>
for [physical] immortality in a page or two, not in any kind of convincing way.
<br>
“Now, after you’ve read some of these books, you still may not agree that 
<br>
all of these ideas are practical, but at least you can discuss them on 
<br>
common ground with other list members. That kind of discussion is 
<br>
practical, helpful, and informative. Extropians are not dogmatists. If 
<br>
there are practical problems standing in the way of the realization of 
<br>
their hopes and ideals, we should be discussing them now, so that solutions 
<br>
can be found.
<br>
“Of course, some people will be opposed to Extropian ideas not because they 
<br>
seem impractical, but because they seem immoral. Re-read the list of 
<br>
Extropian principles above. If you don’t agree with them, if you don’t 
<br>
agree that we should attempt to break through all the limits that constrain 
<br>
us today, then you probably won’t benefit from discussion with Extropians.
<br>
“To sum up, the Extropians lists welcome members who share an interest in 
<br>
the exciting, optimistic, future-oriented philosophy of Extropianism. If 
<br>
you’re new to these ideas, they can offer suggestions to help you find 
<br>
books, authors, and other resources to learn more about what we can and 
<br>
will become. If you’re more experienced, they offer discussion and feedback 
<br>
with a high level of quality and responsiveness. The future is coming, and 
<br>
the Extropian lists offer you a chance to get ready for the fantastic 
<br>
opportunities that await us all.”
