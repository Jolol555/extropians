If I were setting up the kind of high-latency distributed virtual machine
<br>
that SETI@HOME has implemented (mmm, makes it sound a lot more polished than
<br>
it probably is...), one factor I would consider important is the
<br>
authenticity of the results coming back from clients. Now there may be all
<br>
kinds of encryption and checking schemes out there, but how do you really
<br>
check if the results are good, unless you can compare them to something?
<br>
<p>It strikes me that a particularly useful way to do this would be to hand out
<br>
packets multiple times. The more cycle donors you have, the less likely that
<br>
anyone could collude to spoof the results. If results did not all match,
<br>
you'd likely discard the results (or take the majority answer?), and either
<br>
block those which send you false results from any more work, or scrutinise
<br>
future results from them more heavily, and degrade your trust rating for
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>The fact that you got the same package twice is not good; not sensible. But
<br>
you could put it down to SETI@Home using redundancy to increase the
<br>
trustworthiness of their results, and that they don't have a good tracking
<br>
system for who received what packets in the past. 
<br>
<p>Really, even given a random distribution of packets with redundant
<br>
processing and no memory of past packet recipients, you probably shouldn't
<br>
receive the same packet twice. But that assumes that you are a negligibly
<br>
small part of the total processing pool... in the case of Spike, I'm not
<br>
sure that's a safe assumption :-)
<br>
<p>Emlyn
<br>
<p>btw: Why do you consider SETI processing to be more important that protein
<br>
folding?
