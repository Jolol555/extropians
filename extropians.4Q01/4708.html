<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The answer is no. Look at communism, Robert. Communism didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; fragment until a number of other conditions were met (probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the Cold War didn't help much to support the &quot;information wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to be free&quot; meme, either)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It isn't clear to me precisely what caused communism to fragment.
</em><br>
It was some time ago but from what I remember, Gorbachev simply let it 
<br>
fall.  There appear to have been no efforts on his behalf behind the scenes 
<br>
to support any of the regimes.  I watched news from domestic, British, 
<br>
Continental and U.S. news broadcasts, and I can't remember him uttering a 
<br>
single word during this time.  Moscow stayed well out of sight.
<br>
<p>It looks as though this led the regimes to fold quickly (with the exception 
<br>
of Romania) rather than a face a protracted civil/military campaign without 
<br>
the backing of Moscow.  If they'd had confidence that Gorbachev was with 
<br>
them, they'd have had the tanks on the streets and ended the 
<br>
rallies.  Given that the Chinese had pretty much gotten away with Tiananmen 
<br>
Square earlier that year, they would have no real reason to fear 
<br>
international pressure.
<br>
<p>Perhaps he didn't know it would happen, but I'm confident Gorby knew what 
<br>
he was up to, and it probably pissed off enough Bigwigs in Moscow to 
<br>
further nudge them towards the '91 coup.
<br>
<p><p><p>James....
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
