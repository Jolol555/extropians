<p><p>Not being a lawyer, shouldn't the US have acted according to what it

felt was right? Your argument above makes sense, but I was told about
<br>
two wrongs not making a right a long time ago. It seems to me that this
<br>
is a lot of the problem, using these weapons lowered those who used them
<br>
in the eyes of the world, whereas restraint, or acting according to
<br>
principles the US espoused, would have been the better option. Unless of
<br>
course there were other reasons for using it other than the publicly
<br>
announced reasons.
<br>
<p>I have not read the Geneva convention but I'd have thought that one
<br>
country signing it binds them to act accordingly, not that both parties
<br>
have to be signatories for it to apply. Although, we are talking war
<br>
here, so it may well be full of loopholes.
<br>
<p>The &quot;the Russians would have risked a nuclear war in the future if it
<br>
wasn't demoed properly&quot; argument makes a LOT of sense to me, much more
<br>
so than the reason we are given (Japanese surrender).
