</em><br>
<p>You misunderstand the nature of the distinction.  (Notice that I didn't
<br>
have to call you a fool or label your politics in order to frame the
<br>
disagreement?  Try that sometime.)  The US government claims to act on
<br>
behalf of citizens.  Any legitimacy it has comes from the consent of the
<br>
governed.  The Japanese government doesn't care what I think (except
<br>
when they act in a way that gives us cause to go to war with them.)  I
<br>
want our government (little as I want a government) to act in ways that
<br>
are allowed by the laws, and consistently with freedom.  They didn't,
<br>
and if we don't protest, they'll feel like they can get away with it
<br>
again.
<br>
<p>They came for the Japanese and noone complained.  We learned.  When they
<br>
came for the Arabs, there was a big uproar.  Not that they couldn't
<br>
detain them, but they had to be careful.  There are a lot of people who
<br>
think they aren't being careful enough.  Not many would argue that the
<br>
police investigation and the questioning shouldn't be done, but they
<br>
want our government to learn from past bad examples and respect people's
<br>
rights.  We don't know which of them are innocent, so we should be real
<br>
careful to treat them all as if they probably are until there's good
<br>
evidence otherwise.
<br>
<p>For the actual terrorists who were on airplanes, it didn't take the
<br>
investigators long to come up with reasonable evidence that they were
<br>
connected to Al Quaeda.  Anyone that they couldn't come up with similar
<br>
evidence on in a similar period, they should be treating with kid
<br>
gloves, and that doesn't seem to be happening.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [...]  The Japanase government has never apologized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this treatment, generally denies that it took place in their history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books, and has never paid a dime to the survivors or their families,
</em><br>
<p>That's a different problem from the actions of our government in
<br>
depriving citizens of their rights, and I have no problem with those who
<br>
focus on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and our government prevents our citizens from suing the Japanese over
</em><br>
this.
<br>
<p>I agree that this is wrong.  I shouldn't have to complain about either
<br>
of these wrongs in order to complain when our government throws citizens
<br>
(or others who should be presumed innocent, my my reasoning) in
<br>
detention camps, and confiscates their belongings.
<br>
<p>The fact that the Japanese (were/may have been) worse isn't a defense of
<br>
the US government's actions.
