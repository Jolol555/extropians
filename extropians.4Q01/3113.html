<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION WEEKLY UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Long-lived mice survive even longer with calorie restriction
<br>
<p>Readers of Life Extension Weekly Update may recall the June 8 issue which
<br>
described Snell dwarf mice, genetically engineered to live longer than
<br>
average mice.  Another mutant mouse is the Ames dwarf, bred to live
<br>
approximately 50% longer due to the longevity gene Prop1, and who resemble
<br>
calorie restricted mice.   In a study reported in the November 22 2001 issue
<br>
of the journal Nature <a href="http://www.nature.com">http://www.nature.com</a> , a team of researchers
<br>
including Donald K Ingram of the National Institute on Aging sought to
<br>
determine if calorie restriction could further lengthen the lifespan of this
<br>
long-lived strain.
<br>
<p>Forty-five Ames dwarf mice two months of age were divided into groups who
<br>
received calorie restricted diets or unrestricted feeding.  Fifty-three
<br>
normal sibling mice were divided to receive the same regimens.  The calorie
<br>
restricted mice received diets gradually lowered in calories to a target
<br>
range of 70% of that of similar animals fed ad libitum.  The amount of food
<br>
provided to the restricted animals was kept constant after the animals
<br>
reached two years of age, in contrast to the unrestricted animals, whose
<br>
level of food consumption naturally declined.
<br>
<p>Both normal mice and Ames dwarf mice who received calorie restricted diets
<br>
lived longer than the controls in their groups.  The Ames dwarf mice
<br>
experienced a significant extension in lifespan, outliving all groups.
<br>
While the Ames dwarf mutation appeared to delay the age at which the
<br>
age-dependent increase in mortality risk first becomes noticeable, calorie
<br>
restriction appeared to reduce the rate of aging itself.  The researchers
<br>
conclude that the Ames dwarf strain is not an imitation of a calorie
<br>
restricted mouse, with separate pathways involved in lifespan extension.
<br>
However, both groups of mice were found to have smaller body size, and lower
<br>
levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor, glucose and thyroid hormone,
<br>
factors that may contribute to slowing aging and longer lifespan.  They
<br>
write, &quot;This supports the idea that hormonal regulation of metabolic
<br>
pathways in response to altered food availability may be a way of regulating
<br>
lifespan that is deeply rooted in evolutionary history.&quot;
<br>
<p>WHAT'S HOT
<br>
Hemochromatosis mutation associated with shorter lifespan
<br>
<p>In a study appearing in the November 12 2001 issue of the journal Archives
<br>
of Internal Medicine, researchers studying the genetics of 1,784 individuals
<br>
found that mutations of the HFE gene that are associated with hereditary
<br>
hemochromatosis are found less frequently as a population ages, confirming
<br>
an association with a shorter lifespan. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a
<br>
genetic disorder of iron metabolism, affecting only one out of every 200 to
<br>
300 people, yet one in eight to ten individuals are carriers. The disease
<br>
occurs most often in males, and is characterized by iron overload and the
<br>
deposition of iron-containing pigments in the tissues. It is considered 100%
<br>
fatal if not diagnosed and treated early.

<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Obesity
<br>
<p>We've learned in the last three decades that smoking reduces our life span.
<br>
Likewise excess body fat also reduces our life span.
<br>
<p>&quot;Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in women,&quot;
<br>
according to the Journal of Experimental Gerontology. Obesity contributes to
<br>
sudden death relative to heart disease, according to the American Heart
<br>
Journal.
<br>
<p>Those with existing disease, such as diabetics, already have a 2 to 3 times
<br>
normal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Add a little body fat and
<br>
those risks increase dramatically. If you are suffering with a chronic
<br>
disease, weight control is of utmost importance to your health and
<br>
longevity. To attain optimal health and longevity, a person must be at or
<br>
below their ideal body weight. Today's lifestyle and access to fast food
<br>
makes that a hard goal to reach.
<br>
<p>The risk of disease is not just confined to adults; recent studies have
<br>
identified that children and young adults also face increased health risks
<br>
if they are overweight or obese.
<br>
<p>While it may seem that the medical community has only recently become
<br>
concerned about the health consequences of body fat distribution, the
<br>
research goes back almost 100 years. Just after the turn of the century,
<br>
insurance companies pooled data on the risk of body fat. They found
<br>
increased weight and increased girth led to higher mortality.
<br>
<p>Research, as we mentioned earlier, connects body weight, particularly being
<br>
overweight, to many of the most deadly diseases. Researchers have found
<br>
that, for example, obese patients have high rates of sudden, unexpected
<br>
cardiac death.
<br>
<p>Most dieters need help in taking off pounds. They need dietary aids to
<br>
jump-start the weight-loss process to give them the encouragement they need
<br>
to stay on the program long enough to succeed. That's why we recommend
<br>
nutrients that fight diseases while taking off pounds. Nutrients make you
<br>
look and feel better while you're losing weight, and it's easy to continue
<br>
to take them year-after-year to stay healthy and fit.
<br>
<p>Those seeking significant fat-loss effects should commit to a 2- to 3-month
<br>
program that would involve the following schedule:
<br>
<p>First thing in the morning take:
<br>
<p>1. Three 1000 mg CLA capsules.
<br>
2.  One DHEA capsule (take with an antioxidant like Life Extension Mix).
<br>
3. One chromium-niacin capsule.
<br>
4. One heaping tablespoon of soy protein powder (soy can be taken at another
<br>
time of the day if desired).
<br>
<p>Five minutes before lunch take:
<br>
5.  Six 500 mg chitosan capsules with an 8-ounce glass of water (some people
<br>
need only three chitosan capsules).
<br>
6.  One 1000 mg ascorbic acid capsule.
<br>
7.  One 200 mcg chromium-niacin capsule.
<br>
8.  One DHEA 15-25 mg capsule.
<br>
<p>Five minutes before dinner take:
<br>
&nbsp;9.   Six 500 mg chitosan capsules with an 8-ounce glass of water (some
<br>
people need only three chitosan capsules).
<br>
10.  One 1000-mg ascorbic acid capsule.
<br>
11.  One chromium-niacin capsule.
<br>
12.One 500 mg magnesium capsule

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Chromium capsules
<br>
<p>Chromium picolinate is a patented version of the trace mineral chromium.
<br>
Studies show that chromium picolinate has lowered serum cholesterol and
<br>
glucose, burned fat, and built muscle. Picolinic acid is produced in the
<br>
human body, apparently for the purpose of improving the cellular uptake of
<br>
trace metal ions. Scientists have demonstrated that several minerals in
<br>
picolinate form are many times better assimilated than most other forms of
<br>
the same minerals.
<br>
<p>Chromium polynicotinate is an equally well assimilated form which may have
<br>
more benefits for certain conditions than does the picolinate form. A recent
<br>
study on antidepressant pharmacotherapy for dysthymic disorder (depression)
<br>
in 5 patients showed that chromium polynicotinate supplementation led to
<br>
remission of dysthymic symptoms and concluded that &quot;Preliminary observations
<br>
suggest that chromium may potentiate antidepressant pharmacotherapy for
<br>
dysthymic disorder&quot;. Another study on chromium polynicotinate in rats
<br>
prevented the sucrose-induced elevation of systolic blood pressure and
<br>
decreased measures of lipid peroxidation.
<br>
<p>Both forms of chromium reduce high serum glucose levels which can contribute
<br>
to aging via a destructive process known as glycosylation (also called
<br>
nonenzymatic glycation), in which glucose molecules bind to proteins and
<br>
interfere with their function. People with diabetes have a highly increased
<br>
rate of protein glycosylation and this plays a major part in their increased
<br>
risk of atherosclerosis and many other diseases. For many diabetics,
<br>
chromium enhances the ability of insulin to lower serum glucose levels.

<p>All in One Weight Loss capsules
<br>
<p>The All-In-One Weight Loss Formula contains a wide range of natural,
<br>
nonstimulating agents that have been shown to help induce fat loss.
<br>
<p>Here are the actions of some of the ingredients contained in All-In-One
<br>
Weight Loss Formula:
<br>
<p>Hydroxycitric Acid (HCA) works by inhibiting an enzyme called ATP
<br>
citrate-lyase that causes excess sugar in your blood to be converted into
<br>
fat.
<br>
<p>Chromium works by enhancing the efficiency of insulin so that excess glucose
<br>
is absorbed by energy-producing cells and not converted into body fat.
<br>
Chromium also lowers cholesterol levels by about 7%.
<br>
<p>Gymnema sylvestre extract works by reducing your craving for carbohydrates,
<br>
especially sugars. Many people cannot control their carbohydrate cravings
<br>
and remain overweight even though they follow an otherwise prudent diet.
<br>
<p>Fiber from chitosan, pectin, guar gum, and psyllium husk works by absorbing
<br>
some of the dietary fat that is normally absorbed into your blood stream.
<br>
<p>Since eating and digestion cause the production of free radicals (which is
<br>
why you should take antioxidant vitamins like Life Extension Mix with every
<br>
meal), we have also included a low-potency antioxidant blend to the
<br>
All-In-One Weight Loss Formula. Folate is also included to help prevent the
<br>
conversion of dietary proteins into the atherogenic agent, homocysteine.

REVERSING AGING
<br>
An interview with Stephen R Spindler, PhD
<br>
<p>L.E.:  Has anyone else ever suggested that calorie restriction could reverse
<br>
aging, not just slow it?  Or is your finding truly unique?
<br>
<p>S.S.:  As far as I know, there had been no suggestion in the literature
<br>
before our study that calorie restriction could reverse age-related changes
<br>
in gene expression.  I think the assumption has been that it prevents
<br>
deleterious age-related changes in gene expression.  It had been our
<br>
assumption as well, and we've published a number of papers on gene
<br>
expression where we just assumed that calorie restriction was preventing
<br>
deleterious changes.  What these studies showed for the first time was that
<br>
in fact that assumption was incorrect.  Calorie restriction can reverse the
<br>
majority of the deleterious age-related changes in gene expression that we
<br>
found.
