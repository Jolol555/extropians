<p>Better idea: since the security problem at airports is one of
<br>
saturation, eliminate all flights of less than 200 miles between major
<br>
cities, and of less than 500 miles along rail corridors, especially the
<br>
Boston/DC corridor. Route rail lines for new high speed trains like the
<br>
Acela to new stations located at major airports, so passengers can make
<br>
connections from train to plane and back.
<br>
<p>This will eliminate a large amount of the 'shuttle' air service that
<br>
bogs down so much of our traffic system and overloads airport security
<br>
systems, while at the same time boosting rail ridership enough to allow
<br>
private capitalization of more Acela trains.
