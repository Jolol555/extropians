<p><em>&gt;&gt; Down With Democracy by Hans-Hermann Hoppe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; One-man-one-vote combined with 'free entry' into government - democracy -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; implies that every person and his personal property comes within reach
</em><br>
of -
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and is up for grabs by - everyone else. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This assumes that democracy comes with no system of checks and balances.
</em><br>
<p>True, though every extant version of democracy -- if by that we means
<br>
societies where the government is elected into power -- there are systematic
<br>
instances where property rights are violated, such as taxes, eminent domain,
<br>
seizures, and the like.  Also, what is up for grabs usually changes and
<br>
generally expands.  E.g., in the US today, people are taxed at historically
<br>
higher rates.  While there might be a tax reduction in certain areas, the
<br>
overall trend is upwards.
<br>
<p>This upward pace accelerated with the transition from monarchies to
<br>
democracies between the 1700s and the 20th century.  (Monarchies are no
<br>
angels either, though historically they were more restrained in taxation and
<br>
the like.  Hoppe, in his _Democracy -- The God that Failed: The Economics
<br>
and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order_, argues that this is
<br>
because monarchs have an interest in increasing their future income, while
<br>
democratic rulers only have an incentive to consume during their term of
<br>
office.  I'm not sure if I buy that.  The historical data fits with his
<br>
view, but it also fits with the view that traditions have been broken in the
<br>
past 200 years which restrained lots of things, good and bad.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As it happens, all the participants in a democracy have a personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentive for preserving their own property rights -- their own.
</em><br>
<p>This depends on the system as a whole.  Naturally, each person has an
<br>
incentive for her or his own self-interest -- almost by definition.:)
<br>
However, if the social context is such that private property in some area is
<br>
not respected, then people will not attach as much value to it.  This
<br>
explains the classic tragedy of commons problem.
<br>
<p>In extant democracies, there are, to be sure, movements to defend property
<br>
rights.  E.g., in the US, there's a whole movement that sprung up in the
<br>
wake of environmental legislation that effectively revoked much private
<br>
property.  However, the general incentive in such systems is not to protect
<br>
what's yours so much as to get what isn't yours.  People, in general, don't
<br>
think about the long term consequences of policy but mostly of short run
<br>
gains.  This is why when biased laws are passed -- and I've been a firsthand
<br>
witness to many on the local level -- because most people don't have much of
<br>
an incentive to stand up against them.  If, e.g., all Americans are being
<br>
taxed one penny to pay for some pork project, then each of us has an
<br>
incentive of exactly one penny to fight that.  (Surely, some of us might
<br>
take a longer range view, seeing that one penny as part of a larger whole
<br>
and it's impact whne rolled together with all 290 million pennies, but most
<br>
people aren't going to look past the penny.)  However, imagine a small group
<br>
of, say, ten people is going to recieve that one penny from each American.
<br>
That small group will get, on average $2.9 million.  That's worth putting up
<br>
to -- you got it! -- $2.9 million in effort to get at.
<br>
<p>The same reasoning applies to other government projects.  Each project that
<br>
is offered up as helping the community always really helps certain specific
<br>
people -- or certain people more than others.  (Often even with poverty
<br>
relief, the poor don't get most of the benefit.)  For example, government
<br>
bailouts of the investors -- in the Mexican bailout of the early 1990s, the
<br>
IMF loans to the Far East during the late 1990s, the arranged bailout of
<br>
LTCM by Alan Greenspan -- were all proportedly meant to help the whole
<br>
economy -- of the US or even of the world.  In essence, what actually
<br>
happened was US taxpayers funded reckless investments by mostly US brokers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is maximized in societies where social mobility -- upwards, as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as downwards -- is maximized; the greater Joe Average's prospects for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximizing their personal wealth, the greater the incentive Joe Average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has for not over-taxing the very rich.
</em><br>
<p>Hoppe brings up a point about class consciousness in __Democracy -- The God
<br>
that Failed_ that speaks to this matter.  Under monarchy, he argues, that
<br>
since those who rule and those who are ruled are basically hermetically
<br>
separated, with rare exception, the ruled have an incentive to watch and
<br>
attempt to keep their freedoms and prerogatives.  Since there's no exchange
<br>
between the classes, there's no hope of losing some capability in general so
<br>
that one might have some privilige later on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He's also neatly side-stepped the issue of constitutional or basic laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that prevent a democracy from making fundamental changes without achieving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near-unanimous, as opposed to majority, support. Bring in such provisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and his whole argument falls through.
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  Constitutional limits on power have been sidestepped or ignored in
<br>
too many instances to seriously make this a good counterargument.  A
<br>
constitution or other limits on power are only good if people actually
<br>
respect them -- whether because those in power have internalized such limits
<br>
or because there are counterveiling forces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;                                   .... The rich are characteristically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; bright and industrious, and the poor typically dull, lazy, or both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He missed out &quot;sickly&quot; or &quot;unlucky&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a friend who has a medical degree. She's damn near bankruptcy. Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through high living, but because she didn't get on with the medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishment, and so went into practice as a homeopath -- then had a run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of really bad luck (buying a home in a neighbourhood where property values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were going downhill, moving out and leasing it to an asshole who defaulted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the rent and skipped out of the country, that sort of thing).
</em><br>
<p>Your point being?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hoppe is advancing an argument based on social determinism, not realism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his universe, everybody gets what they deserve. We, as extropians, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to believe in self-improvement. A corollary of this is that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible for *other* people to improve ... including those who we might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently see as social basket-cases. Whereas Hoppe is espousing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position &quot;once a peasant, always a peasant&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure he's advancing that point.  It seems to me he's saying that if
<br>
something befalls someone, others should not be forced to make good for the
<br>
befalling -- unless they are to blame, in the conventional sense of the
<br>
word.  E.g., I'm not to blame for your doctor friend's financial situation,
<br>
so I should not be taxed to help her out.  (Granted, you and I might help
<br>
her out, but we should not be forced to do so.)  The same logic applies to
<br>
the dull, lazy, etc.
<br>
<p>If this were the case, too, I think lots of people would help them out, but
<br>
it would be limited and there would be no positive feedback loop created
<br>
between antisocial behavior and the state.  And this comes down to the issue
<br>
of improving people in general.  If you really want to improve people, then
<br>
don't take away all relevant reasons to improve.
<br>
<p>Imagine, e.g., trying to teach someone calculus by giving her or him the
<br>
answers to the test and disregarding whether she or he studied or made any
<br>
effort.  If you did that to everyone, with the exception of a few math
<br>
geeks, most people would not learn.  The same thing happens when you set up
<br>
an institutional framework where learning -- how to create wealth, get a
<br>
job, do something useful -- is independent of results.  (Doesn't this
<br>
explain why a lot of well off kids wind up doing nothing and often they
<br>
spend spend spend their parents' wealth?)
<br>
<p>I don't want to go over everything in your criticisms.  I think this is
<br>
enough for now.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
