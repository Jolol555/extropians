</em><br>
<p><p>Your feeling is irrelevant.  The statistics indicate that in practice people
<br>
who legally carry firearms are among the least likely to commit violent
<br>
crimes, and by a substantial margin.  Since weapons have been widely
<br>
available in the US for centuries, natural selection has weeded out most of
<br>
the weapon toting people with control issues.  Consider, for example, the
<br>
regions of the US where lots of people carry pistols and nobody gives it a
<br>
second thought (e.g. some of the rural western States, where guns are
<br>
carried for utilitarian purposes).  Guns are everywhere, but there is no
<br>
blood in the streets.  In fact, the streets are quite safe.  People with
<br>
self-control issues were removed from the gene pool a century ago in those
<br>
parts.  They've ended up with a well-armed but safe and friendly environment
<br>
instead.
<br>
<p>It would seem to follow then, that you couldn't just reintroduce pistols to
<br>
cities and regions that haven't had them for a few generations without
<br>
expecting some initial bloodshed.  In all likelihood those areas have had a
<br>
buildup of sociopaths and people with questionable self-control, so the
<br>
initial conditions for reintroducing personal weaponry would not be at
<br>
equilibrium.
