</em><br>
<p>Sure - hindsight is a wonderful thing. But how do you spot 'obvious'
<br>
terrorists without the benefit of hindsight? Or are you suggesting that
<br>
anyone who has violated immigration laws and is under some sort of suspicion
<br>
should be 'interrogated' (or do you mean 'tortured'?) until they confess?
<br>
<p>The difficulty here is that you believe that it is possible for you (or
<br>
someone from law enforcement) to identify 'the enemy'. As most of Europe has
<br>
found out over the last few decades of terrorism throughout the continent,
<br>
judging who the 'enemy' is turns out to be very difficult. Your approach
<br>
might discover some terrorists; but I suspect at the very great cost of
<br>
throwing away everything about the Constitution and individual rights that
<br>
makes America such a great country.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The ACLU IS a terrorist organization responsible for thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murders. They do NOT defend civil liberties that their left-wing agenda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is opposed to. For instance, the ACLU has NEVER defended anyone's 2nd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amendment rights, and is on record with an official policy of supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun control and gun confiscation laws. Since it has been conclusively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shown that gun use by law abiding citizens saves far more lives than it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs (and those that do die from gun use by law abiding citizens are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely to be criminals than not) then the ACLU is responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the deaths of thousands of Americans who die from criminal assaults,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unable to defend themselves due to gun control laws.
</em><br>
<p>This argument depends entirely on your statement 'Since it has been
<br>
conclusively shown...'. If you are incorrect, then your argument fails. So
<br>
please could you post some evidence to support your argument. To start the
<br>
ball rolling, here's some evidence against your hypothesis:

<p><a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/329/15/1084">http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/329/15/1084</a>
<br>
<p>This study of 1860 homicides shows that &quot;use of illicit drugs and a history
<br>
of physical fights in the home are important risk factors for homicide in
<br>
the home. Rather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are
<br>
associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or
<br>
intimate acquaintance.&quot;
<br>
<p>Best,
