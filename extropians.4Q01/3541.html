<p>
Electrical signals from the parietal reach region (PRR), the part of the brain
<br>
responsible for planning arm movements, can be used to control the movement of
<br>
a cursor on a computer screen. Using signals from an electrode implanted in
<br>
the PRR of a monkey, the researchers were able to mimic the animal's arm
<br>
movements with the movements of a cursor called a prosthetic icon. Eventually,
<br>
the monkey was able to control the icon by thought alone.
<br>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the brain cells responsible for moving an arm
<br>
also can be used to control robotic arms, computer cursors or other devices.
<br>
But this study is the first to show that the cells responsible for planning
<br>
those movements can do the same.
<br>
<p>&quot;The key difference between our approach and the approach of several other
<br>
groups around the country is that we're looking at neural activity that is
<br>
present before, or even without, real arm movement,&quot; says Shenoy, an assistant
<br>
professor of electrical engineering at Stanford.
<br>
<p>The advantage of using planning cells is that they encode a simpler set of
<br>
parameters than motor cells do. Whereas motor cells generate complex signals
<br>
that control the three-dimensional path of an arm as it moves toward its
<br>
target, planning cells encode primarily two parameters: where and when to
<br>
move. Systems based on planning cells may be able to use fewer brain cells,
<br>
and thus simpler electronics, than those based on motor cells. Planning cells
<br>
also are less likely than motor cells to atrophy or change function over the
<br>
course of prolonged paralysis.

<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
