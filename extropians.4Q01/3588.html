<em>&gt; BTW, I think there are a couple of reasons genetic engineering ought to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given more prominence in Transhumanist thinking. First, it is something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we could start right after lunch--at least we have the technology, we just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need the resources and the political will. Imagine if genetic engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smarter persons were taken on with the same sort of political enthusiasm as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landing men on the moon. I realize that around here genetic engineering is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not as &quot;sexy&quot; as uploading but it would seem wise not to put all our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthuman eggs in one basket. (After all, the claim that humans can create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI is an empirical and falsifiable proposition). Second, my experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that when it comes to presenting the Transhumanist case it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better in the first instance to discuss concepts like 'posthuman' in meat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms. Talk about SIAI requires two conceptual leaps for most people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; namely, that we can create superintelligence and we can create AI.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From what he has said about this subject, I think Stephen Hawking would agree
</em><br>
with you. However, roboticists may be able to create human-competitive
<br>
intelligence in a few more decades, and that makes it difficult for
<br>
geneticists to keep up with the pace. As for uploading, that may be the
<br>
slowest approach of all, judging by the complete lack of progress in that
<br>
area. The strongest reason to think that robotics will take the lead is that
<br>
robots are a proven economic powerhouse. Anything that can replace humans as
<br>
workers has immense (verging on unimaginable) economic value, and as we know,
<br>
money makes the real world turn. AFAIC, posthuman is just another word for
<br>
human-competitive robot.

analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual

uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,

non-sensory experience, SETI

<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
