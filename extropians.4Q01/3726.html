<em>&gt; My problem with data as identity is that it doesn't contain any of the
</em><br>
<p>we still don't know what makes us aware.
<br>
we can talk about it in natural language, emphatize while tuning to
<br>
synthesized airwaves or electromagnetic waves, but all we discuss is mere
<br>
interfacing
<br>
between reality and _this_.
<br>
still any human can make irrational (not random) decisions, can imagine, can
<br>
go astray of reality, can go backward in evolution, can act against own
<br>
specimen,
<br>
every human _is_ so called 'god'.
<br>
ofcourse it's representation in reality (percieved as 'body') can be forced
<br>
to do whatever
<br>
you like (still it is only a representation), even psychology and
<br>
werbalisation (translation
<br>
of feelings) can be influenced, even sense of music, memories, or feelings
<br>
can be modified,
<br>
but we still talk only about _representation_ of 'spiritual being'.
<br>
<p>what it means to be 'me'?
<br>
it depends to who - some reduce their scope to own 'ego', some extrapolate
<br>
individual
<br>
representation to other representations, for example idea of being
<br>
'together', or being 'we',
<br>
cultrural identity.
<br>
<p>you can ofcourse go into world of idiots, detached gods, where every ego
<br>
tries to isolate
<br>
from other egos, but still - language of reality is common to all idiots
<br>
(they communicate with each other
<br>
thru  reality, they're still one mind, but isolated due to a 'reason' which
<br>
caused separation of ego from
<br>
other beings ego)
<br>
<p>opposite case occurs in state of egolesness (i.e. after LSD or in case of
<br>
schizophrenia)
<br>
when ego don't exists, 'me' means surroundings, body as representation
<br>
speaks not for
<br>
'itself' but describes only surrounding information metabolism. it is better
<br>
described in cases of
<br>
LSD ingestion rather than in cases of schizophrenia (mainly because you get
<br>
your ego back @ comedown,
<br>
maybe also because some folks called it 'recreational' so others simply
<br>
wanted to know how it feels like)
<br>
generally subject is what the place where subject is placed is mixed with
<br>
memories which subject absorbed
<br>
before loss of ego. so subject's ego _is_ information. 'me' is information,
<br>
and it feels like that then.
<br>
<p>AI simulating LSD ingestion would say :
<br>
'how it is like &quot;being on acid&quot;?'
<br>
'because your input is my only input available it is like question about LSD
<br>
ingestion and all of my stored responses'
