<p>Are we not dropping food packets and was not the population facing
<br>
a situation where hundreds of thousands of people were at risk of
<br>
starving this winter *before* Sept. 11th?
<br>
<p>What is the foreign aid budget of the United States?
<br>
Should we not be spending that money?   (I'm sure many of the
<br>
libertarians on the list would argue against it...).
<br>
<p>Should we just ignore the world entirely (as was the general
<br>
course before Sept. 11th)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd much rather support my practice of being a human living on

<p>The question is *how* does one go about doing that when you know
<br>
for sure that there are people who consider you to be an &quot;infidel&quot;
<br>
and are willing to commit terrorist acts against you?  Should we
<br>
all just go live in a bunker in the Mojave desert?
<br>
<p>As has been discussed in other threads -- the &quot;cultures&quot; of the
<br>
world (including our own) are *not* sustainable.  Sooner or later
<br>
once you have developed the technologies to cure diseases and
<br>
adopt the use of those technologies the world goes to hell
<br>
in a handbasket *unless* those cultures change.  Those cultures
<br>
that value &quot;boys&quot; over &quot;girls&quot; will result in &gt; 2 children families
<br>
which sooner or later will lead to overpopulation and a destruction
<br>
of the ecosystem.  Our own culture being dependent on oil is
<br>
not sustainable and the global warming it will eventually cause
<br>
will at some point cause significant problems.
<br>
<p>Amara complains about the U.S. being intolerant of other cultures.
<br>
We complain about others (e.g. greens) being intolerant of our
<br>
&quot;culture&quot;.  I think we need to truthfully acknowledge that all
<br>
of the cultures have problems and we should focus on finding
<br>
the common ground (e.g. sustainability and extropic freedom)
<br>
that will lead us out of the mess.
<br>
