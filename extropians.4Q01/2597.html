<em>&gt; Hello Extropian crew:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Below are some questions I originally submitted to T.O. Morrow.  If anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like to add their own replies to my questions, please do so under each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; T.O. Morrow entry.  A bio of each contributor would also be appreciated.  
</em><br>
<p>Here are my comments:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; QUESTIONS:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; JEREMY: As far as current paradigms go, it has been a pet-peeve of mine to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see critiques of Virtual Reality constantly tied to the limits posed by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ???immersion???.  For example, in the seminal work ???DataTrash??? by Arthur and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marilouise Kroker, virtualization is seen as a process where the physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties of the flesh are consumed or ???harvested??? into a partial and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomplete reality.  In a sense, one would become immersed in a space that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not equally co-existing with reality.  Therefore, some critics are saying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that virtualization initially seduces the body through its promise of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (immersive) escapism but eventually degrades the physical integrity of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meatspace by retreating into a false and secondary reality.  Even today, new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realities being built by developing and speculative technologies are being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confused with having exclusively immersive properties.  An Extropian example 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that comes to mind is the dream of uploading our minds into an immersed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective-super-conscious entity. As far as I understand, this is still a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirable Extropian vision.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TOMORROW: Though I cannot pretend to speak for every self-proclaimed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian, I for one do not aim at Borganization.  I certainly aim to change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and grow, understand; I do not aim to obliterate my individuality, however.
</em><br>
<p>There are two issues here: the creation of virtual environments having
<br>
more or less connection to &quot;base reality&quot;, and the creation of new ways
<br>
of being. The first effort may be motivated by escapism, art or the need
<br>
for worlds more amenable to change - be it a physical world augmented by
<br>
virtual overlays, a physical world controllable through nanotechnology
<br>
or an entirely virtual world designed to demonstrate a scientific
<br>
concept. Whether this leads to a retreat into a false reality depends on
<br>
far more than just the technology. I think the existential computing
<br>
ideas of Steve Mann show that a virtualization can instead lead to an
<br>
enhanced participation in the real world. 
<br>
<p>As for creating new forms of being, that may be motivated by a
<br>
cybergnostic denial of the flesh but also the desire of more fulfilling
<br>
forms of existence. Again, what is more important is not the immersion
<br>
but what values are driving it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; JEREMY: Has ???immersion??? become synonymous with ???evolution????  If not, do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see the possibility that our definition of the world ???virtual??? is at this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point narrow and that a future VR will include extroverted realities that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmonize with the???real??? rather than harvest it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TOMORROW:  I recognize the possibility that you describe--that virtual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realities will always retain links with external meatspace.  And, indeed, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regard purely virtual realities as more a theoretical possibility than a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely eventuality.  But at any rate, your question concerns conditions at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too far a remove to allow very confident claims.
</em><br>
<p>Currently work on augmented reality, where the virtual and real worlds
<br>
are superimposed, show great promise of making immersion part of the
<br>
real world rather than an escape from it. The main issue is of course
<br>
which aspects of the real world to attend to - living in a multilayered
<br>
reality requires new perception skills or augmentation to really produce
<br>
an enhanced reality rather than a more confused reality. This is where
<br>
the transhumanist interest in finding ways of human augmentation meshes
<br>
well with efforts to create more human realities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; JEREMY: As of today (November 08, 2001), I have heard the news that the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single-molecule transistor has been developed by Bell Labs (a division of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lucent Technologies).  From hearing this news, I am reminded of a prediction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Wired Magazine (I think in 1998) that if we progress according to plan, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have the first commercial nano-assembler on the market by 2004.  Given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current rate of technological benchmarks and breakthroughs, do you think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that such a prediction by Wired may still be accurate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TOMORROW:  No, I would not bet on that prediction.
</em><br>
<p>Neither do I. But reading Nature, Science and Proceedings of the
<br>
National Academy of Sciences these days does give the same thrill as
<br>
science fiction magazines once gave...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  JEREMY:  Given this, what do you think will be the first commercial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applications of the assembler?  Do you envision any immediate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artistic/cultural/aesthetic applications of the assembler once it is on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TOMORROW:  I predict the first assemblers will work mainly on materials 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing, since they offer a relatively easy first job.  For that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason, I do not foresee any immediate culture effects--unless you include 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recouping R&amp;D costs as part of culture!
</em><br>
<p>Nanoassemblers are merely tools in the same way microprocessors are -
<br>
they enable a host of abilities but are in themselves not that &quot;sexy&quot;.
<br>
But just as computers had significant cultural effects long before
<br>
reaching the microprocessor stage, emerging nanotechnology will likely
<br>
affect culture. A renewed interest in the possibilities of the very
<br>
small, the organic shapes created by biotechnology and supramolecular
<br>
chemistry, the possibilities of materials with ultraprecise texturing
<br>
and novel properties, all of these are possible cultural effects.
<br>
<p>On the commercial side, assemblers are likely best at making new
<br>
assemblers and molecular tools. Already before them limited systems will
<br>
act as artificial enzymes, at first changing chemical production, later
<br>
medicine, materials and computing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; JEREMY: Here is an elaboration/extension on Question #2.  Since September the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 11th, there has been a lot of government money thrown towards the  U.S. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; National Nanotechnology  Initiative and Nanotech startup companies such as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zyvex  Corp. in Dallas.  Given the logic of the ???trickle down effect???, when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you see this technology filtering down from the Defense and Medical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priorities down to the level of the personal prosumer?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TOMORROW:  I'm not really very well placed to make predictions on timetables, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I'll only venture a range from 2015-2050.
</em><br>
<p>I would agree. The problem is that predicting the rate of advance of any
<br>
future technology is highly uncertain, but this question adds the
<br>
economic, political and cultural dimensions to it. It might well be that
<br>
(as possibly in the case of genetic modifications) the greatest
<br>
applications of nanotechnology in manufacturing and personal life will
<br>
not occur in the first world but the third world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; JEREMY:  The Foresight Institute has given a lot of attention to cautious and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughtful discussions towards the practical and moral implications of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nanotechnology but little foresight has happened with regards to discussions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with the future of cultural discourse once this promised technology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has arrived..  At first glance, this may not seem too strange because the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate foresight necessarily needs to deal with issues that may mold or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroy our environment totally.  However, the apparent lack of initiating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any active cultural thinktank devoted to foresight may be lacking foresight 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself as K. Eric Drexler  in his book ???Engines of Creation??? (1986) seemed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to suggest that the end-goal of Nanotechnology is to create a generation of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberated  Performance Artists because Nanotechnology should in theory, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide for all our material wants and needs.  The only thing left to explore 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maintain would ultimately  be culture.  So, what importance do you place 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the value of developing a creative thinktank at his time?  Or, do you think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is best for the technology to arrive first before the context is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate for thinking about the specific direction that creative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals will take? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TOMORROW:  I think Foresight has taken the correct focus.  To try to predict 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture would at best waste time, and at worst fritter away resources better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent on more concrete and preliminary matters.  The very nature of culture 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; renders it immune to prediction; it arises out of the interactions of free 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals in a particular place and time.  We can only wait and see--with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great anticipation--what tomorrow's artists will create with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnological tools. I think Foresight has taken the correct focus.  To

</em><br>
<p>I agree with T.O. Morrow about the impossibility of predicting culture.
<br>
But culture is far more than art - it is about values, ethics, shared
<br>
symbols and themes. And these things matter deeply in how nanotechnology
<br>
will be shaped. Cultural foresight would not deal with predicting a
<br>
future culture but in actively creating it - by seeking out currently
<br>
isolated strands of discourse and bringing them together, opening
<br>
channels of dialogue between C.P. Snow's two cultures and by formulating
<br>
ideas for philosophy and culture that might help form a basis for a
<br>
culture adapted to a world with nanotechnology and other radical
<br>
technology. Technology and culture (co)evolve together. This might not
<br>
be the job of Foresight Institute, but it is still necessary work to do
<br>
if we want to avoid having a world with radical technology but totally
<br>
outmoded ideology.
