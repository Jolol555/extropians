<em>&gt; &gt;That is contrary to what Bush is claiming about this war.  We

<em>&gt; &gt;9/11 attacks but all terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are referring to the difference between the short term and long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term goals.
</em><br>
<p>I am actually referring to the difference between what you
<br>
believe we are about and what our officials say we are about. 
<br>
They do not mesh.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I personally think the long term goal will fail as it degenerates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the usual political bickering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think the long term goal will fail also but not because of
<br>
political bickering, although that will be what it looks like is
<br>
occurring.  It will fail because it is ill-defined, nebulous,
<br>
never-ending and hideously expensive in life, dollars and
<br>
well-being of &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; and counter to our best visions
<br>
for the world we wish to build. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If we are not looking for a solution then this is just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;vengeance.  It is not even about protecting ourselves from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;further terrorism or, to the extent possible, making terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;less likely in the world.  Why should we have an unlimited and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unbounded committment to only that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was wondering when you were going to raise the vengeance issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again. Yes, it's partly vengeance, which I know you have a problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with, But the families of the victims and millions of my fellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans do not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Will they be satisfied when/if 4.5 million Afghanis die of
<br>
starvation this winter?  Cycles of terror are maintained by
<br>
incident/vengeance/counter-vengeance.  At some point the causes
<br>
of the entire pattern must be addressed outside of vengeance if
<br>
it is to have an end.  Vengeance is understandable but not
<br>
always productive.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; By the way, if you destroy all the terrorists and their supporters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there would be no more terrorism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and if we had anti-gravity and teleportation we could
<br>
really accomplish the miraculous!  Seriously, there is no way to
<br>
by force destroy terrorism and what it grows from.  It is a very
<br>
dangerous fallacy to belief this can be done.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The reasons they hate us are many, largely it seems because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; are taught lies in Pakistani maddrasas, and are broadcast bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; lies via Al-Jazeera television.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is utterly simplistic.  To say that all who are angry with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;us are dupes and liars is surely obviously biased and unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to be accurate.  For one thing it denies real events that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;angered many in that part of the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't find it particularly simplistic at all, I've watched a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of material on this, and as usual, when questioned those who oppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us have very simplistic answers they can't particularly defend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you have been spoonfed material that supports this
<br>
notion or makes it easy to come too.  But it ignores that the
<br>
region has been massively manipulated by the US and other
<br>
countries in ways that have been detrimental to the people and
<br>
against our own principles in many cases.  It ignores that many
<br>
in the area have good reason to be angry at US.  In that way
<br>
respect it is certainly simplistic.  But when I or others
<br>
attempt to bring out those reasons we are considered
<br>
anti-patriotic or not behind the &quot;righteous&quot; &quot;war&quot; sufficiently,
<br>
leftist and so on.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I've already said I don't care if they hate us, I intend on making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it clear that if they attack us they will be destroyed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you care if we have acted and are acting like international
<br>
bullies and destroying homes/lifes/countries for reasons that
<br>
will greatly anger and disgust you?  Do you care whether we live
<br>
our ideals outside the US as well as inside?  Do you care
<br>
whether we become an armed camp in order to avoid terrorist
<br>
attacks?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The Al-Jazeera is one of the few relatively independent voices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in the area.  I thought we are supposed to be for a free press.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Or does that only apply in America and other rules apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;anywhere else if they say unpleasant things about us?  I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we believe in free speech.  Only here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Al Jazeera is an Islamic media tabloid. They feed the population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what they want to hear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I see.  And our media does not uh?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; They are part of the problem, I don't care if they exist or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Of course not.  You only care, judging from the above, about
<br>
vengeance and proving it will cost a lot to ever poke the US
<br>
again.  Doesn't that seem like a tad provincial attitude?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are out to end this sort of thing on a permanent basis. We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sending a clear message: &quot;being a terrorist will get you hunted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down and killed, find another way to express your frustrations.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is not the way to end terrorism.  It will not work and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;never has worked throughout history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No terrorist who has been destroyed has ever committed another act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of terrorism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How many have risen up in his place?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Find me one piece of evidence that indicates the Israelis are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; responsible for Sept 11, and I will retract my opinion about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ridiculous Islamic tabloid known as Al-Jazeera.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Your opinion based on one set of editorials is irrelevant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Whether there is evidence of Israeli involvement or not is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the issue.  You are advocating blaming a particular publication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and shutting it down although it is not remotely any of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;business to do any such thing and such attitudes and acting on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;them are part of what pisses many off toward the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They broadcast numerous lies concerning the Israelis and the World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trade Center. They are an Islamic tabloid, nothing else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You refuse to consider the fact that those who spread outright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsehoods or half-truths are part of the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't refuse to consider it.  I simply point out it is not all
<br>
of the problem or as much of the problem as you seem to want to
<br>
make it out to be and that attempting to forcefully end that
<br>
&quot;source of the problem&quot; will not work.   Do you belief we don't
<br>
spread our own falsehoods and half-truths btw?  The idea that
<br>
the lies they tell about us plus religious fanaticism is
<br>
sufficient to explain their hatred and terrorist actions IS such
<br>
a falsehood and half-truth.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't care if they exist or not, I just know better than to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider them anything other than a source of propaganda.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So.  Does your enlightenment extend to western media?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; You may not have seen anything that convinces you, but I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; convinced long ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Then present your evidence if you would.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've already explained I'm not interested in making a legal case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm interested in finishing these people off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I see.  Regardless of actual guilt in the one incident you say
<br>
you are about addressing, you have picked parties to destroy in
<br>
order to satisfy vengeance, provide a lasting image of our power
<br>
and believe you (plural) have actually addressed and finished
<br>
with the issue.  Got it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If your interested in pursuing a legal angle you might want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start with those who tried the first time destroying the World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trade Center. They we're scheduled to be sentenced the day after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the attack occurred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are known Bin Laden associates. Enough for me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Really?  Guilt by association is sufficient?  Associates
<br>
involved in one attack on X are suficient to believe all attacks
<br>
on X are the work of bin Laden?  Whatever.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; If I was to become a terrorist you would never find sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; evidence to convict me in any court.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But that is hardly an argument that you did or did not commit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;any act is it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course not, But I could stand there and say &quot;prove it&quot; and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never would be able to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So then you just decide I am guilty anyway and blow me and any
<br>
who would gainsay you away?  Much better than terrorism isn't
<br>
it?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Sound familiar?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To what end?  What are your objectives?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Destroy Bin Laden/Al-Quaeda, destroy their Taliban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; supporters/allies, re-establish a viable government (democratic)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; for the people of Afghanistan, get out and go home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;OK.  That is at least much more modest than what Bush and co.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are proposing.  Getting bin Laden and changing the Afghani
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;government are only the beginning for them.  On what basis will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you destroy the Taliban rather than simply deposing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;government?  I don't see any righteous basis for us fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;destroying them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Taliban allowed Bin Laden to have his terrorist bases there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are in complicity with Al-Quaeda, and will now share their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Interesting.  What of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, and so on who
<br>
at one time or another thought the Al-Quaeda network was a
<br>
reasonable think to partially support?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Surrendering is their only hope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Why is crushing Kandahar a big objective?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Taliban stronghold, see above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;OK. But I don't understand your above goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Taliban are in cahoots with Al-Quaeda, they are equally guilty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our eyes for the attack on New York.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Really?  I find this sort of reasoning quite empty even granting
<br>
the assumption fundamental assumption.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Destroying the Taliban utterly would cause a lot of innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;suffering also.  As the Al-Qaeda is supposed to span multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;countries destroying it would not end at Afghanistan either.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;where else would you see us march in for a military action?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You'll have to explain to me how destroying the Taliban would cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent suffering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>They are very well entrenched and have a fair amount of popular
<br>
support within Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries in the
<br>
area even now.  The civilian populations that are within and
<br>
their supporters will die in large numbers if you been by
<br>
&quot;destroying the Taliban&quot; destroying all who consider themselves
<br>
Taliban.  If you mean only removing them from power many will
<br>
still die but not as many.  So which do you mean?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We will pursue Al-Qaeda wherever they exist, countries that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist bases (Sudan) may face military action. But I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current plan is to use agents in other places.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I see.  So much for yuur early seeming claim we were only
<br>
involved in Afghanistan and then would go home.  Will you then
<br>
go after Hammas and other groups?  Do you think you can end or
<br>
eviscerate so much anger by militarily finding the most actively
<br>
angry and killing them and inflicting whatever &quot;collateral
<br>
damage&quot; it takes?  To me this is a very very dangerous and
<br>
twisted fallacy that can do nothing but much more seriously
<br>
inflame the world and endanger all of us (all of humanity not
<br>
just us) and what we hold most dear.
