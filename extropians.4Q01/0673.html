A question is a candle to a cavern

<p>#### I really love these words.
<br>
<p>Just to comment on Colin's thoughts about the fundamental uncertainty of our
<br>
knowledge about &quot;facts&quot;:
<br>
<p>We might ask what is the meaning of &quot;knowing&quot;. How do I know that the color
<br>
of my keyboard is pale gray? When looking down from the computer screen I
<br>
can actually see it. Now, assuming the truth of the scientific method, and
<br>
the truth of the results of neuroscience research on color vision (which in
<br>
turn is built on a whole pyramid of beliefs about the world which seem to be
<br>
indispensable for survival from minute to minute and day to day), I know
<br>
that there is a very complicated cascade of events from light striking my
<br>
eyes to a perception of color. And, of course, the ability of my brain to
<br>
think about keyboards and other objects is again non-trivial. There are many
<br>
ways in which even these perceptual processes could go wrong (as verified by
<br>
other observers, if they exist), even more so for the higher abstractions
<br>
(personal identity, math, morality) built from them. So, more sophisticated
<br>
thinking actually deprives me of the naive confidence of childhood, where
<br>
what I saw simply was. And this is even without invoking the old &quot;Are we
<br>
living in a simulation?&quot; or &quot;Only I exist&quot; mindgames. Is there something
<br>
that I could be absolutely, unequivocally sure about? 
<br>
<p>There is one thought which is appears &quot;true&quot; to me no matter what actual or
<br>
only theoretically possible objections I raise. It could be verbalized as
<br>
&quot;Something is&quot;. The exact nature of &quot;something&quot;, or the real meaning of &quot;is&quot;
<br>
cannot be fathomed, and probably cannot be known with certainty, because to
<br>
know what &quot;is&quot; is, you have to know the meaning of time, the meaning of
<br>
timelessness, the relationship between mathematics and the observable
<br>
reality - in fact, to explain the meaning of &quot;is&quot; you have to be either
<br>
omniscient, or an impeached president.
<br>
<p>So, yes, I agree with Colin that almost nothing is certain but, in a true
<br>
pancritical-realistic vein, it's fun to find out things, even if you never
<br>
know for sure what it is that you are finding out.
