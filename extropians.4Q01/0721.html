Beautiful people spark a brain reaction
<br>

Hazel Muir
<br>
<p>Catching the eye of someone beautiful triggers a flurry of activity deep in
<br>
the brain, new research has found. The discovery may shed light on why first
<br>
impressions last when we meet new people.
<br>
<p>Evidence is growing that in animals, a region of the brain called the ventral
<br>
striatum becomes active when the animal anticipates a reward of food. The same
<br>
region becomes active in drug addicts and compulsive gamblers when they are
<br>
about to indulge their habit.
<br>
<p>Knut Kampe of University College London and his colleagues wondered whether a
<br>
social &quot;reward&quot; - the sight of an attractive face - would have the same
<br>
effect. To find out, they scanned the brains of eight men and eight women as
<br>
they looked at 160 photos of 40 different people in quick succession. The
<br>
volunteers then rated how attractive they found the faces they had seen.
<br>
<p>Social 'gift'
<br>
Unattractive faces did not activate the volunteers' brains. But the ventral
<br>
striatum became more active when the photo was of an attractive person looking
<br>
straight out at the viewer, and less active if the person's gaze was averted.
<br>
<p>Kampe thinks this makes sense, because exchanging looks with an attractive
<br>
person represents a social &quot;gift&quot;, while it's disappointing to go unnoticed.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, these responses were not sexual - they happened regardless of
<br>
the gender of the person in the photo. We might link any attractive people
<br>
with &quot;reward&quot; because they have high social status. &quot;Meeting a potential good
<br>
friend or someone who might influence our career might be very rewarding,&quot;
<br>
says Kampe.
<br>
<p>He adds that the response seemed quick and automatic and might partly explain
<br>
evidence that we make snap judgments of people within three or four seconds of
<br>
meeting them.

<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
