&lt;&lt;Ha! Looks another another wonderous pseudo scientific justification
<br>
for yet another ripoff of the rights and properties held in common by
<br>
all American citizens.
<br>
<p>Reporters are morons...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am not sure I disagree with you, on the &quot;reporters&quot; contention. The article 
<br>
was interesting because it is a challenge to the notion that technology is an 
<br>
unalloyed good, rather then something that is neutral and requires foresight 
<br>
in the way its applied. I don't see anything bad about that. 
<br>
<p>I see technology as an absolute necessity (otherwise why I am so obsessed by 
<br>
it?) however, technology that is foolishly applied can get things screwed 
<br>
royale. If smart engineers, physicists, chemists, biologists, managers, 
<br>
economists, designers; are give encouragement to ask tough questions and get 
<br>
the job done Well, and not merely, on Thursday, then luddites will be 
<br>
disarmed.
