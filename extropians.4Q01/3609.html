Mike Lorrey responded to something Amara wrote (in response to something
<br>
of Samantha's that's not relevant here.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; [because of terrorism at the Munich Olympics]  the German government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; initiated a new law to &quot;register&quot; people [...]. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; law applies to all people, not only to foreigners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like me. So if a German citizen wants to move one floor down in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apartment building, for example, they would be breaking the law if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they didn't register their new address within a short period of time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the law in most all countries. It is the law here in the US. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most states, it is the law to report any change of address to the DMV
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within 10-45 days after moving. It has been this way for decades. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference is that most all police will only treat it as an advisory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing. I don't know of anyone they've actually prosecuted for not doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so.
</em><br>
<p>There's a distinction between the form of the law in the US and the form
<br>
that Amara is complaining about.  There's no law that all citizens in
<br>
the US have to have their residences registered with the police.  If you
<br>
don't have a driver's license, you don't have to tell the DMV when you
<br>
move.  If you have a PO box listed on your license, you don't have to
<br>
tell them when you move, unless you move to a different state.  (There
<br>
are people who neither drive, nor have a DMV-issued &quot;alternative ID&quot;.)  
<br>
<p>When there's a law on the books that isn't enforced uniformly, that's an
<br>
opportunity for police and prosecutors to enforce it selectively.  That
<br>
doesn't show that the law has no effect, it shows that everyone is at
<br>
risk of falling under the emnity of someone with power to enforce laws
<br>
you didn't realize you were violating.  &quot;Everybody does it&quot; isn't an
<br>
excuse in the eyes of the court, but it often explains why someone
<br>
didn't realize that a technical violation was, in fact a violation.
