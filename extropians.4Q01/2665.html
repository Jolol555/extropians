<em>&gt; Back to the thread, I think the idea that artists are &quot;in tune&quot; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering might be due to the correlation between bipolar disorder and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artistry. My guess is that the suffering per se isn't the important part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, but rather the mania. However, I seem to recall other results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysing famous artists and their work, and apparently reaching the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite conclusion. Bipolar disorder is likely (IMHO) some form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dysregulation of the neuromodulator systems, so strictly speaking it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not about the cortex (some personality typing systems try to connect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personality with neuromodulator levels - c.f. C.R. Cloningers work).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In any case, there are obviously plenty of great artists who aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depressive in any way. So depression doesn't seem to be necessary for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; art. Maybe it helps by providing wrenching dark hues to the composition. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Try, as a far-fetched thought experiment, to imagine you are not
<br>
immortal after all.
<br>
<p>You may sense a kind of dissatisfaction with your condition, that will
<br>
happen to connect you to all of humanity so far. I don't think this
<br>
dissatisfaction (whatever the part of the brain in which it is
<br>
embodied) is a disease, but rather the result of a lucidity that makes
<br>
us different from other animals. In fact it is one of the very origin
<br>
of transhumanism. And I do think that art has often be, so far, linked
<br>
to that dissatisfaction, among others. When everything that is &quot;not
<br>
right&quot; looks solvable in real life, art is not very much needed. You
<br>
just solve it and spend time in happiness. But everything is never
<br>
solvable in real life, so art will always be very much needed.
<br>
<p>To be even more precise, I don't think that what art *produces* really
<br>
keeps any link to suffering. And that's the beauty of it : you get
<br>
somewhere else than where you started. But I do think that it is
<br>
usually engendered as an answer to dissatisfaction. There may be forms
<br>
of arts remote from this mechanism, which I don't know of yet. But the
<br>
ones I know and have first-hand experience with, the ones that I have
<br>
the pleasure to see working every day, do bear such link, and it is
<br>
the potential born by the dissatisfaction that allows for something to
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>Of the writers I mentionned, only one, minor (Houellebecq) seems
<br>
clinically depressed. None of the others. As far as I understand it,
<br>
clinical depression makes it difficult to do anything, art included.
<br>
<p>Back to the thread, I had a look at the Enneagram stuff, and it seemed
<br>
totally hopeless to me. To almost any question, I thought to myself
<br>
that the two options of the choice described two coexistent aspects of
<br>
my personality. I am a peacemaker, a reformer, a helper, an achiever,
<br>
an individualist, an investigator, a loyalist, an enthusiast and a
<br>
challenger. Successively, and simultaneously. Very much so :-)
