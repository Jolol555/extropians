<p>&lt;&lt; You are dreaming. The Israelis have broken almost every
<br>
&nbsp;agreement they ever made with Palestinians.  The Israelis have
<br>
&nbsp;continually pushed for more and more Palestinian held land and
<br>
&nbsp;have continuously sent tanks and attack helicopters into
<br>
&nbsp;civilian areas.  If I was Palestinian I would hate Israeli
<br>
&nbsp;policies as much as many of them do. They go out of their way to
<br>
&nbsp;blow up Palenstenian officials and to assasinate their leaders
<br>
&nbsp;outright.  They blow up Palestinian police stations and then
<br>
&nbsp;wonder why the police don't catch terrorist.  Israle has acted
<br>
&nbsp;extremely slimey toward Palestinians and then claimed any
<br>
&nbsp;fighting back was only fanatical terrorism which just shows what
<br>
&nbsp;fantatical &quot;animals&quot; these Palestinians are.

Glad I am fading from this list, as the most of the Palistinians I have 
<br>
encountered seem to be ardent admirers of Hitler. Perhaps I run with the 
<br>
wrong crowd? From what I have observed the PA turned down the Clinton-Barak 
<br>
Plan of 2000, which 95% of the West Bank&amp; all of Gaza was offeredup, as well 
<br>
as all of east Jerusalem. Chairman Arafat turned this offer down as 
<br>
&quot;insufficient&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Previous, to this, Marwan Bhaghoutti of the PLO permitted Hamas training 
<br>
schools to anti-Jewish (yes the J-word) unabatted during the highs and lows 
<br>
of the Oslo years, the Wye accords, the Clinton-Barak plan of 2000. This was 
<br>
an open dismissal of all 3 agreements, all on the PLO's part. 
<br>
<p>As far as how the Palistinians behave, the &quot;police&quot; by day, are the Tanzim 
<br>
snipers by night, and they didn't even have to remove their uniforms. This is 
<br>
akin to the kluxer who happens to a town sherriff is the old South. The 
<br>
program of assasination conducted by Israel on PLO and Hamas guerilla's 
<br>
basically has stunted, but not eliminated much of the bombings conducted by 
<br>
each organization. This was a response, rather then an innitiation to suicide 
<br>
bombers, snipers and the rest. Curious that there has never been a redaction 
<br>
of any peace agreements appearing in any official Palistinian newspaper, 
<br>
using the Arabic word for peace, in all this time, since the Oslo accord was 
<br>
signed. Curious also, is the statement by Marwan Bhaghoutti, saying that 
<br>
&quot;..pay no attention to what Chairman Arafat delcares to the western presss..&quot;
<br>
<p><p>If it is slimey to survive, then so be it. When Al Qeida scores a few more 
<br>
American deaths, perhaps more Americans will also behave in a &quot;slimey&quot; 
<br>
fashion?  Finally, I will let you in on a tiny secret; most Jews know when 
<br>
thou art using Israel for a whipping-boy for Jew hatred (even though this is 
<br>
always profoundly denied). All anyone has to do is dig a bit deeper and the 
<br>
true intention is invariably uncovered.
<br>
<p>Best Wishes, Mitch
