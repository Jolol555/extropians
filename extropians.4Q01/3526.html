<p>Excerpted from link:
<br>
/I also discovered the intricate problem of designing a language:
<br>
/                 - An ideal language must have 1) simplicity (to make the 
<br>
language easy to
<br>
/                learn and use), 2) redundancy (to prevent errors from 
<br>
occurring), 3)
<br>
/                 compressibility (not taking too long to transmit common 
<br>
modes of thinking) and
<br>
/                 4) flexibility (to allow creative use of the language to 
<br>
deliver memes in the
<br>
/                 most accurate way possible).
<br>
/                 - You cannot achieve all these ideals simultaneously.
<br>
/                 - You cannot compromise with all of them without making a 
<br>
language cumbersome
<br>
/                 and inefficient.
<br>
/                 - You can focus on a few, but your language will lack the 
<br>
important others.
<br>
/                 - So what can we do? Sorry, I cannot give an answer yet 
<br>
as I had not completed
<br>
/                 my research.
<br>
<p>If we are dealing with a posthuman language we can posit exceptional 
<br>
language learning abilities.  This means that we can neglect the simplicity 
<br>
of the language entirely, and possibly flexibility too, since new languages 
<br>
could be learned and used for different situations.  I can see posthumans 
<br>
having a language for spatial relations/physics/math, another for social 
<br>
relationships, maybe another for statistical relationships, and a general, 
<br>
flexible one.
