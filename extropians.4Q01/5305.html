<em>&gt; &gt; As for po2, I think I can at least throw out a first iteration: trust is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about long-term relations. As Axelrod suggested, you can build trust in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; IPD-like situations since participants know they will be around each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other for a long time, and hence it is in their interests to cooperate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think it was Novak who later on did some game theory on how reputation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also helps: if your actions become known to others, then it pays to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yourself trustworthy since other members in your community will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your past actions into account even when they were aimed at somebody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; else. So trust can be promoted by making past interactions clearer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well known, and by the awareness of that there is a long future ahead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also consider that trust between strangers evolves from each individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics, which is one reason why 'discrimination' or 'prejudice'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a natural phenomenon of human relations. If your experience tells you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that men or women are more trustworthy than the other, you will trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals in the future based on that experience. If your experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that you can trust blacks more than whites, you will do so with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks you don't know as well (and vice versa if your experience is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverse).
</em><br>
<p>The problem is when prejudices do not become postjudices. 
<br>
<p>In order to function in the world we need to have prior expectations about
<br>
nearly everything, and we acquire them in all sorts of ways even if we have
<br>
never directly encountered the object of expecation - through culture,
<br>
through stories about the experiences of others, deductions and sometimes
<br>
random preferences. These expectations then influence how we act, producing
<br>
experiences we can learn from. A rational being adjusts their expectations
<br>
to fit experience, ideally taking metacognitive factors into account such as
<br>
the risk of confirmation bias etc. The prejudice (prior probability
<br>
estimate) has become a postjudice (a posterior probability estimate), and
<br>
the process can continue. 
<br>
<p>When we normally talk about prejudices, we do not refer to prior estimates
<br>
but rather to the tendency of not updating estimates - especially about
<br>
other people. This is an irrational strategy, and in itself a reason to
<br>
trust prejudiced people less (since their actions have a persistent
<br>
irrational component and are not based on correct estimates of the state of
<br>
the world).  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is why bin Laden's terrorism handbooks advise infiltrators of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US to groom and dress themselves as westerners, obtain western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identities and documentation, etc: not only does this tactic take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of this implicit trust, but it also amplifies the effect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequent terrorist attacks have by causing Americans to question this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implicit trust of people appearing in western guise.
</em><br>
<p>Which may actually be a good thing, since it is not a reliable predictor of
<br>
trust anyway (ask any conman). In fact, it might be worth examining what
<br>
trust predictors people commonly use that are *not* valid and see if they
<br>
could be made valid or be recognized as invalid. Better trust signals can
<br>
make our society more trusting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The problem we face here is that we now have a far larger and diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society with larger tensions - suddenly everything is global, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neighbour is a gay zoroastrian sociologist and the smallpox genome can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be found on the Internet. Solutions trying to fix things by making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world a smaller place (isolationism) are practiclly unworkable (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefits are enormous), as are attempts to put genies back in bottles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (relinquishment). Attempts to make people less diverse are not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethically questionable and impractical, they also tend to breed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resistance that produces just the kind of nasty backlashes we have come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to fear. Hence any solution has to deal with strengthening those webs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. Part of this is mechanisms to better filter out those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untrustworthies who have infiltrated the webs of trust. As a chain is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong as its weakest link, the solution is to check each and every link
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for integrity.
</em><br>
<p>A better solution is to have a web rather than a chain. A web is stronger
<br>
than its weakest link. 
<br>
<p>A problem of current attempts to find infiltrators is that they will attack
<br>
non-infiltrators too from time to time. While some such errors are
<br>
unavoidable and acceptable, there is a risk that pervasive infiltrator-hunts
<br>
undermine trust more than they protect them. Suspicion does not breed
<br>
confidence.
