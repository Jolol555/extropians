<p>Doug, it wasn't the rectennas I was concerned with it was the waste heat
<br>
from the use of the electricity.  Cities already generate their own
<br>
local weather patterns due to the fact their temperatures are higher
<br>
than surrounding land.
<br>
<p>And yes, I agree that at current power consumption levels, it would
<br>
probably not be a &quot;significant&quot; problem.  But as Robert Freitas points
<br>
out in Nanomedicine it only takes ~10kg of actively operating nanomachinery
<br>
per person to put us over the global hypsithermal limit.  Once we have
<br>
&quot;unlimited&quot; off-planet to planet power sources -- are you going to limit
<br>
the size of your augmentation agents down here on Earth?  One has to
<br>
realistically plan for the idea that more than X kW/person and you
<br>
have to migrate into space.  Better that we start being aware of
<br>
the problem sooner rather than later.  There is a side benefit that
<br>
I'm sure that some will like.  The lower you keep the planetary
<br>
power consumption the greater the sensitivity you have to people
<br>
releasing uncontrolled self-replicators.  So limiting the on-planet
<br>
energy consumption gives you much longer lead times with regard
<br>
to terrorists releasing self-replicating agents.
