If it lives up to the description in the Time magazine article, I think the
<br>
Segway has got a lot of potential.
<br>
<p>A couple of points buried in the article
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- It doesn't go fast enough for people to hurt themselves if they crash,
<br>
but it does go faster than walking.
<br>
&nbsp;- It uses very little power, extremely little; its range should be
<br>
excellent.
<br>
&nbsp;- It's not supposed to compete with cars, it's supposed to compete with
<br>
feet. More correctly, it's supposed to fill a niche that isn't currently
<br>
covered, and support cities that are basically giant pedestrian malls
<br>
surrounded by car parks. Reading between the lines, I think you are supposed
<br>
to bring the Segway to the edge of town in your car (or on the train or
<br>
bus), then zoom around the car-free zone.
<br>
&nbsp;- It's extremely safe, you can't hurt yourself in a crash (unless you are
<br>
being a complete f*ckwit)
<br>
&nbsp;- They've seem to be working on the US govts to allow it on sidewalks in a
<br>
big way, approaching from multiple angles. Apparently people in the US will
<br>
see postal workers zooming around on them real soon now.

<p><p>well Emlyn has 2 good points... how do you carry anything and what about
<br>
rain, but there are other implications also. 
<br>
<p>I think that until there is an infrastructure in place (special lanes on
<br>
sidewalks for example) that will support this device, it will be banned
<br>
from sidewalks just like skateboards and scooters are in many cities. I
<br>
can also imagine that safety while riding the thing is going to be a
<br>
huge issue. Self-balancing or not, I would still want to be strapped in
<br>
or something if I am zooming down a road at 30 miles per hour! Helmet
<br>
and pads would have to be required I would think... which might look
<br>
funny on a postal worker! 
<br>
The picture from Time doesn't show the top of the device either... I
<br>
want to see how it is steered, and if you even have to hold on at all. 
<br>
I would love to see the performance specs on the thing... stuff like
<br>
ground clearance (HMMM I wonder if you can put all-terrain knobby tires
<br>
on it???), turning radius, maximum incline allowed, top speed, etc.
<br>
Imagine what all the pro skateboarders/rollerbladers would do with this
<br>
thing too hahaa! 
<br>
<p>One last thing... is there a sidecar attachment??? :P
