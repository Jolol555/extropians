Ron (<a href="mailto:dehede011@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Dumping%20%20(was:%20Local%20Groups%20Wanted!)&In-Reply-To=&lt;14f.650e74f.295b26f5@aol.com&gt;">dehede011@aol.com</a>) offered:
<br>
<p><p><p>&lt;&lt;Spudboy, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the real question is why should we be content with their trade 
<br>
practices?  It is perfectly okay with me if they are content but that imposes 
<br>
no burden for us to agree with them. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you will find this find this acceptance of an uneven playing 
<br>
field between us and the Japanese goes back to the cold war and that was over 
<br>
ten years ago. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, personally I have no problem with the Japanese looking out for 
<br>
themselves but I do have a problem with our government not looking out for 
<br>
our side. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>That is the problem with the Chamber of Commerce mentality, anyway. There is 
<br>
little 'economic nationalism' on our part, but there is a huge reservoir in 
<br>
Asian economies. However, in light of 9-11, I suspect that US perspective, 
<br>
our collective hierarchy of needs has changed. At some point, however many 
<br>
years down the road, reciprocity will be desired by the American public, and 
<br>
that will likely compel the elected officials to start heeding public demand.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Example, a couple of years ago we negotiated a new deal with the 
<br>
Vietnamese.  As I understand the deal we got to invest all the money we 
<br>
wanted in their country and they got to sell all the manufactured goods they 
<br>
wanted in our country.  The question is did they open their markets to our 
<br>
manufactured goods? 
<br>
Ron h. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The simple answer is no, the Vietnamese did not open their markets. As many 
<br>
realize, the rest of the world doesn't have the Anglo obsession with free 
<br>
markets. If many of the other world's economies (people's) achieve a sense of 
<br>
satisfaction with manipulated markets, then who are we to object? That answer 
<br>
is; we object when our own ox is gored. Americans, in the aftermath of 
<br>
September, are not howling in the streets over Japanese dumping, or the 
<br>
importation of H-1B's to compete directly for programming jobs. We are 'ok' 
<br>
with it, by in large, and from a real-world point of view, that is all that 
<br>
matters. I am not concluding, that mass torchlight parades be held in the 
<br>
streets in opposition to this issue. Merely, that we are, for whatever 
<br>
reason, content with things so far. Perhaps Abe Maslow figures in the 
<br>
situation somewhere?
