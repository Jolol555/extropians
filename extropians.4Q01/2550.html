<em>&gt;From: Amara Graps &lt;<a href="mailto:amara@amara.com?Subject=Re:%20Pardon%20my%20rant&In-Reply-To=&lt;200111121515.HAA06556@well.com&gt;">amara@amara.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Let them tell you. The Afghans are a fiercely independent, proud
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people, with a rich history going back centuries, with deep inner
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lives, with the last one or two hundred years tied strongly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their land. The binding of that culture is their language and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;combination of the above. *They* know what is good for them, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outsiders. The proposal that I heard yesterday of going with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;troups to _their_ country and &quot;rebuilding&quot; (????) into a &quot;new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan&quot; made me turn white. I didn't sleep well last night
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the last nights with what I'm hearing here and what I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regarding the war outside my home.
</em><br>
<p><p>The people of Afghanistan are a whole series of tribes with a long
<br>
history of fighting with each other as tribes will do. The only
<br>
time they are known to unite is to fight outsiders.
<br>
<p>Their country is currently a mess, and as soon as we are done
<br>
destroying the terrorists there and their Taliban supporters who
<br>
are in fact outsiders, we would like to leave. But we can't simply
<br>
leave because the people there need our help, or someones help, and
<br>
not many seem eager to grab the toilet brush.
<br>
<p>So we are going to stick around and try to help.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It's not unusual to have splits or huge philsophical/religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences between a group of people who share the same language
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within the same country's borders. In Germany, there are so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;variations (dialects) of the language, that the Northern Germans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even have difficulty  understanding the Southern Germans and vice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;versa. East and West are still communicating poorly, and with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bitterness.  The differences exist and you work with it, finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the commonalities to communicate, and so that is what is done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here, sometimes successfully, sometimes not successfully between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all of the different ethnic groups, peoples, nations, religions.
</em><br>
<p>The Afghans infrastructure is in ruins, without outside assistance
<br>
many will perish. I'm all for doing &quot;the least we can do&quot;, and then
<br>
getting out.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The Europeans could learn alot from the Americans about how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;work together&quot;, and the Americans could learn alot from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Europeans about how to respect and care about enormous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences.
</em><br>
<p><p>There isn't any country in the world with more total differences
<br>
than America.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Right now the Afghans are really hungry and really angry. They've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had to fight two superpowers for 20 years who have devasted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manipulated, meddled to an unbelievable degree. Now the extremists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of that culture are in power and I am not surprised about that.
</em><br>
<p>The Taliban are not indigenous, they are invaders as well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;P.S. I'm a lot closer to Afghanistan than you are, and I'm an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American.
</em><br>
<p>Are you trying to say because you are geographically closer you
<br>
have some special insight?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&quot;Drosam pieder pasaule.&quot; (The world belongs to the brave.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                             --a Latvian proverb
</em><br>
<p><p>Damn straight.
