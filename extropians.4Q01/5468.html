</em><br>
<p>Well, as  a legally dead person, your rights are *greatly* diminished.
<br>
People have rights, but a dead person is not really a person. That is
<br>
why we need to do research and show that cryonics does present a
<br>
viable medical alternative.
<br>
But there are legal loopholes, and it is through these that cryonics
<br>
slips. See the FAQ at www. cryonet.org
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By this I mean, Does your estate get carved up in the usual manor, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or can you state that your estate is your property even in death ?. 
</em><br>
<p>Wills, etc, are still applicable. And do not overlook the payable on
<br>
death bank account....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;       Obviously a death certificate will be completed. So what happens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if/when you are revived ?. Will we need new birth certificates ?. Will you be 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;       The list is endless and the arguments are hyperthetical at the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, these questions will have to be answered by those in the
<br>
future, just as they will have to develop the technical solutions to
<br>
cryonics.  I wish there were more solidity to cryonics, but at present
<br>
I fear that we must simply make the best of things.
<br>
<p>We have no other choice, as far as I know....about the only thing that
<br>
I see as possible help during the next 30 years is genetic engineering
<br>
(GE).  There is SO MUCH potential for life extension there, although
<br>
at present the yuck/taboo factor prevents the general populace from
<br>
allowing it to proceed full scale.  However, there is money to be made
<br>
through GE, thanks to intellectual property laws, so therefore look
<br>
for ongoing propaganda to change the minds of the populace, however
<br>
gradually.  
<br>
<p>As far as nanotech goes, it appears to have serious life extension
<br>
benefits, however, the timeline may be over the next 100 years
<br>
(despite extropian doctrine...)
<br>
<p>You may want to post these questions on the cryonet mailing list.
