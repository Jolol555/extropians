<p>The papers don't go into much of the details unfortunately.  There
<br>
is probably a few billion going into vaccines and biomedical research.
<br>
There is another huge chunk going into emergency preparedness
<br>
(FEMA teams, hospitals, etc.).  Then there is a lot that needs to
<br>
go into securing water supplies, chemical plants, air intake ducts,
<br>
access to public buildings, federalizing airport security, etc.
<br>
Reliable security doesn't come cheap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Last week two House leaders proposed the $7.5 billion Cyber Security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Research and Development Act.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Early on in its life the Code Red Worm was estimated to have cost $1.2 billion.

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/08/01/code.red/">http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/08/01/code.red/</a>
<br>
<p>Makes sense -- maybe 100+ million machines, 1-3 hours to upgrade, $10-50/hr.
<br>
The costs of security holes mounts quite quickly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;will take to task departments that don't spend *more* on computer security&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Spend the money &amp; be secure or be insecure and potentially amplify
<br>
the problem.  Should &quot;Thyphoid Mary's&quot; be allowed to walk the streets
<br>
and spread the disease?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Washington and the Valley share a common interest in putting new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies to use as fast as possible.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yea, well, that's politics for you.
