Noisy honesty time from me: Everybody is an asshole sometimes (Strong form of the Dilbert Law).
<br>
<p>John Clark + Samantha Atkins + Mike Lorrey + Some people probably on my plonk list / wrote:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;a lot of heartfelt and deeply held beliefs lubricated with an occasional insult&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I'm not a cop, nor do I play one in VR. The best government is self-government, nicht wahr?
<br>
<p>I see people doing a lot of arguing past each other. I see people who are in tactical mode
<br>
arguing with people in strategic mode. I see bald assertions and NOT a lot of actual thinking
<br>
going on. I see people reacting. I see setpieces with verdidgris encrustations, to be frank.
<br>
<p>Urine and bile can really make a watering hole unpalatable. I've been stepping around the obvious
<br>
brackish pools, but maybe since I'm between jobs at the moment I ought to take up the mantle and
<br>
be sweetly reasonable until everyone is sick of me and unites against me. :| :)
<br>
<p>I understand that feelings run high when survival is at stake. For what it's worth, I think
<br>
the &quot;nice guy with an inoperable astrocytoma&quot; model should be reflected on while everyone
<br>
takes a time-out on insults. Not all the fingers point outwards.
<br>
<p>Something I've been thinking about is a required mail client that delays posting until 48 hours
<br>
has passed. But you can't force a person to be reflective (James Bond movies notwithstanding--
<br>
that was _superficial_, don't you know).
<br>
<p>Consider once more, I beseech you all: is this a private club? Is this an outreach site? 
<br>
Is righteous indignation the highest level of discourse to be achieved here? 
<br>
<p>Must an intellect be brittle to be sharp?
<br>
<p>Mike,
