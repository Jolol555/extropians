Plus, another question must be asked... How important is it to protect a
<br>
very small minority of artists' ability to earn $100M for recording one
<br>
album (probably around 1 month's work). If there is an ability for most
<br>
producers of quality work to support themselves, which I feel there probably
<br>
is in a freely downloadable content model, that must be better than the
<br>
current situation. 
<br>

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For example, the Dixie Chicks sold 9 million copies of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their Fly album in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the two years after it was released [1].  It probably sold 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for about $15.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If they had reduced the cost to 1/10 as much or $1.50, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sold 10 times as many copies?  90 million copies?  That's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as there are households in America (116 million [2]).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think the market is that big for the Dixie Chicks' music.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Even at $1.50 a copy, they would not sell an album to every 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; household
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the country.  They would make less money at 1/10 the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price per unit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Dixie Chicks do better to sell their album for a larger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sell to fewer people.  The exact point of optimality will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depend on how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quickly the market falls off as the price rises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look at it from the other direction: the market was willing to cough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up $100 million dollars to listen to a Dixie Chicks album, in a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where those people could download the songs themselves for near-zero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That means the mere convenience of getting it on a small disk that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can take to the car, the &quot;coolness&quot; of having an authorized copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with artwork and liner notes, etc., and perhaps the value of assuaging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their conscience that they are obeying present law, was worth $100M.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's completely on top of what they get for live concerts, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on television, endorsement deals, and other income not dependent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IP.  Anyone who argues that the age of downloading (which takes away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only the value of that conscience-stroking) will cause artists to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starve isn't doing the math.
