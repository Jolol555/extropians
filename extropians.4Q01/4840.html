Even if this tape is the  truth (which is questionable until examined by independent  experts), it still would not prove that anyone is the &quot;epitome  of evil&quot;.  That *is* a pointless construction.

<p>Samantha, please explain to me WHAT it takes to qualify as the epitome of evil in your mind??  I would really like to know!  I think a person need only commit one vicious murder or rape to enter epitome of evil status.

It sure seems like it has a point to me, please explain why my seeing the point is an error. I also wonder why calling American foreign policy evil presumably has a point as you say it or imply it in nearly ever line you write, this in spite of the fact that they haven't crashed a civilian airliner into a civilian skyscraper recently.

<p>Samantha, were you a lawyer, even the ACLU would find you too liberal!!  I think of you as a caring, but very naive person.  I respect that you want to go to the wall for civil rights, but see you as misguided.

<p>I must agree there.
