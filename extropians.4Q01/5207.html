<p>John,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds good but it isn't quite right.  The Boston Consulting 
<br>
Group in the late 70s or early 80s allegedly laid out a strategy for Japan 
<br>
that consisted of lowering prices to the point that they chased their 
<br>
competitors from the market place.  That was reported in the press during 
<br>
that time period and I assume the press got it right.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, once the American manufacturers have been chased from the market 
<br>
place they will have lost their physical plant and their expertise.  Today 
<br>
when I walk through manufacturing plants it is obvious they have lost a lot 
<br>
of their expertise even at this time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to see how this happens.  It is only necessary to read the 
<br>
newspapers to see the layoffs and to see the sharp diminishment in the number 
<br>
of want ads in the technical fields.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am retired but a couple of years ago a plant owner called me in and 
<br>
asked me to see what I could do to increase his production.  His problem was 
<br>
simple any decent Industrial Engineer could have solved it for him.  But, 
<br>
unfortunately American plants today all too often cannot afford that kind of 
<br>
staff.
<br>
