<p><p><p><p>Scottish Hawks and the Harvard Business School
<br>
<p>A Canadian explains how the Americans will win the war against
<br>
terrorism
<br>
<p>Grant McCracken

McGill University
<br>
<p><p>My Scottish brother-in-law and I used to run in the countryside
<br>
outside St. Andrews.  Every so often, we would come upon a cluster
<br>
of feathers, maybe 10 or 12 of them, lying in a confused circle on
<br>
the path ahead of us.  Finally, I asked him what they were.  He
<br>
didn't know exactly, but he had heard a local farmer say they were
<br>
the result of an attack by a hawk or an owl. They hit with such
<br>
force that feathers are knocked off the bird they're attacking. 
<br>
It's the shock of impact.
<br>
<p>Last night, my dinner companions were exploring the case for
<br>
pessimism. The Americans could not win the war against terrorism,
<br>
they concluded. However successful the Americans were in
<br>
Afghanistan against the Taliban, and even if they captured and
<br>
punished bin Laden and the al Qaeda organization, they would lose
<br>
the smaller engagements of the longer term.  Their previous and
<br>
present military intervention in the Middle East has set in train
<br>
a series of terrorist attacks.  Anthrax and other acts of
<br>
bioterrorism would continue.  Strikes against government buildings,
<br>
dams, and power stations would grow.  Porous, open, vulnerable, the
<br>
US must find itself increasingly battered and destabilized.
<br>
Finally, it must discover itself the captive of a vicious circle,
<br>
each act of retaliation setting off yet another debilitating attack
<br>
by the enemy.  Victory was impossible.
<br>
<p>I sat listening, pretending to nod sagely, and pretty soon I found
<br>
myself thinking about the Scottish hawks I helped train at the
<br>
Harvard Business School (HBS).  I thought particularly of one of
<br>
them, Jack, who used to sit, appropriately enough, on the upper
<br>
most row of the classroom, the &quot;sky deck&quot;, as it's called.  Jack
<br>
was amiable in Gary Cooper, Kevin Costner sort of way.  In a
<br>
roomful of 80 gifted students, he was not the most aggressive or
<br>
the most vocal.  Occasionally, in the heat of a debate, he would
<br>
signal me with the subtlety of someone making a bid at a high end
<br>
auction.  In the courtly, challenging convention of the school, I
<br>
would call on him. &quot;Mr. Dawkins, what do you say?&quot;  He would circle
<br>
the upper reaches of the classroom once, to show us the geography
<br>
of the problem.  And then he would strike the problem with such
<br>
power and ferocity that it disappeared.  Other, less gifted,
<br>
students would continue to fight over the remaining &quot;problem
<br>
parts,&quot; but, really, the class was over.  After a particularly
<br>
dazzling Dawkins strike, I heard one of his fellow students murmur,
<br>
with a touch of envy, &quot;Thanks for coming, everyone.  Drive safely.&quot;
<br>
<p>I particularly admired the elegance of these events.  There was no
<br>
exertion, no macho posturing, no thumping of the chest, no self
<br>
congratulation.  It was the American accomplishment, the event
<br>
that, in some ways, defines their essence: the application of a
<br>
very high order of intelligence with system, rigor and clarity to
<br>
a real world problem. Jack would remain his usual, amiable,
<br>
Cooper-Costner self.  No self advertisement.  No false modesty.  I
<br>
saw him at his HBS graduation and he said he was trying to think of
<br>
the best way to sell eye-glasses in the Third World. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Do you know,&quot; he said with an uncharacteristic glint of anger,
<br>
&quot;that some people are classified as blind in parts of the Third
<br>
World because they don't have glasses?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;How's the business plan going,&quot; I asked.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's the hardest problem I've ever had to solve,&quot; he 
<br>
said.  
<br>
<p>I whistled silently.
<br>
<p>Nothing I've seen or heard in the press seems to reckon with this
<br>
aspect of the American preparedness for war.  But, surely, this is
<br>
a key strategic consideration.  How smart are they?  How well and
<br>
with what intelligence will they undertake their war effort?  A
<br>
second question is germane: how have they been mobilized by this
<br>
particular conflict?  How will this effort compare to previous
<br>
ones?
<br>
<p>It's worth asking why we ignore this aspect of the American
<br>
capacity for war.  There are a couple of reasons, I think.  The
<br>
first is, simply, that most Americans are not going to say it about
<br>
themselves.  Modesty aside, they suffer the anthropological problem
<br>
of living their &quot;excellence&quot; so intimately and constantly that it
<br>
is hard for them to see.  
<br>
<p>Why others have not said it for them, this is harder to know.  It
<br>
is probably true that we have created a little &quot;culture of denial.&quot;
<br>
<p>First, some take a peevish pleasure in doubting the intelligence of
<br>
American corporate, military and government worlds.  Academics and
<br>
Leftists, in particular, like to suppose that everyone there is a
<br>
numb skull.  There was a time, after he took office, when people
<br>
seemed to go out of their way to say how dumb they thought
<br>
President Bush was.  (I would struggle to keep from saying, &quot;well,
<br>
he may not be Stephen Hawking, but there's a pretty good chance
<br>
he's smarter than you.&quot;)  Second, people have dusted off their
<br>
&quot;ugly American&quot; ideas.  Americans are unsubtle war mongers, the
<br>
Major T.J. &quot;King&quot; Kong played by Slim Pickens in the movie Dr.
<br>
Strangelove, so in love with war they ride bombs to target.  The
<br>
war machine is a large, clueless bureaucracy run by large,
<br>
unsophisticated people rendered stupid and dangerous by blood lust.
<br>
<p><p>When you suggest that this idea is simple prejudice, the &quot;no
<br>
victory&quot; camp will sometimes change tack suddenly and triumphantly.
<br>
<p>Fine! Americans are capable, efficient, intelligent, and
<br>
formidable. In fact, they are steely, soulless, technocrats who are
<br>
so concerned with efficiency that they care nothing for the horrors
<br>
inflicted by their war machine.  This was the argument brought
<br>
against people like Robert McNamara and the Rand Corporation during
<br>
the era of the Vietnam era and it became, I think it's fair to say,
<br>
a staple of the counter-culture. It lives on.  These days it
<br>
flourishes.
<br>
<p>As it turned out, these stereotypes were some of the first
<br>
casualties of war.  If an American President had cause to launch a
<br>
massive and immediate strike against the enemy, Bush was surely so
<br>
empowered by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Towers.  We
<br>
would not have been entirely surprised to hear that American planes
<br>
had launched by noon of September 11th and that parts of
<br>
Afghanistan now lay beneath a radioactive haze.  Was this not the
<br>
agenda established by the Major &quot;King&quot; Kong stereotype?  But, no,
<br>
Bush asked for patience and it was nearly 2 weeks before anything
<br>
much was forthcoming.
<br>
<p>In an odd turn of fate, the military action taking place in
<br>
Afghanistan at the moment has the look of the guerrilla action that
<br>
proved so hard for Americans to contain in Vietnam.  Small groups,
<br>
traveling light, striking particular targets and disappearing into
<br>
the darkness.  Now it is for Taliban forces to wait for the enemy
<br>
to present itself in a fixed engagement of standing armies.  It
<br>
turns out this &quot;big, clueless bureaucracy&quot; learns as it goes.  And
<br>
it's now teaching itself how to be less big and more mobile.
<br>
<p>The war cabinet has also proven false to form.  With the exception
<br>
of one or two moments of rhetorical bravado, Bush resists
<br>
vainglorious language.  Rumsfeld and Powell counsel patience, show
<br>
gravitas, always resisting the bellicose gesture for the
<br>
statesman-like one.  In the place of Rambo-like posturing, there is
<br>
almost a dry dedication to purpose, as everyone works through the
<br>
sheer scale, intricacy and dynamism of the problems before them. 
<br>
And what evidence of the heartless technocrat?  We hear instead of
<br>
the hours spent in cabinet thinking about how to prevent civilian
<br>
casualties in Afghanistan. 
<br>
<p>All of the arguments against US victory suffer a fatal problem. 
<br>
They refuse to grapple with the fact that Americans are good at
<br>
what they do, and that they are getting steadily better at it. 
<br>
This government as a decision making machine is better than the one
<br>
that served Bush's father.  This business world is capable and
<br>
efficient in ways that are impossible to think about 10 years ago. 
<br>
The diplomatic skills of the civil service are adroit and strategic
<br>
in ways were not available to Kissinger's organization.  Finally,
<br>
the present military makes the force that served in Europe, Korea
<br>
or even Vietnam look primitive by comparison.  Cultures of denial
<br>
are, of course, designed to perpetuate themselves in the face of
<br>
countervailing data.  But it takes very robust denial indeed to
<br>
survive the evidence that now accumulates.  
<br>
<p>Were it not for a chance to teach briefly at HBS, this might be
<br>
mysterious to me, too.  But having been there for a year, some
<br>
things are clear.  This institution is single minded in its
<br>
devotion to teaching.  One image comes to mind in particular.  It
<br>
is of an HBS professor, a South Asian, a man reputed to have made
<br>
fundamental contributions in math and logic, a difficult man, if
<br>
truth be told.  He is arguing with a colleague about what the
<br>
&quot;second board&quot; should be for the class they are going to teach that
<br>
afternoon.  They are arguing with such concentration that they do
<br>
not notice the elevator they are waiting for has come and gone 5
<br>
times.  There may be institutions in the EU and Canada that care
<br>
this much about teaching.  I have never heard of one. 
<br>
<p>This ruthless concern for quality shows on the student side.  One
<br>
can see class pictures in the HBS hallway of a time when the school
<br>
was the preserve of the not-always-very-bright male descendants of
<br>
New England families.  That time is gone.  My class was 30% female
<br>
and around 30% foreign.  The feeder schools are now more likely to
<br>
be Ohio State than Princeton.  The test scores are breath taking. 
<br>
The abilities formidable.  Jack was not the only Scottish hawk in
<br>
the classroom.  Most of them could take him on and hold their own. 
<br>
Almost all of them, in good moments, could parse problems and
<br>
summon solutions as if prescient and not merely smart.
<br>
<p>HBS would, I'm sure, like to think of itself as unique.  But there
<br>
are perhaps 60 great professional schools of business and law in
<br>
the American system.  Together, these institutions produce
<br>
thousands of graduates each year of an amazingly high standard. 
<br>
All those graduates become professionals, and each year they are
<br>
tested and made better by the challenges of early, middle and late
<br>
career.  As a result, this country has a very deep &quot;bench.&quot;  Even
<br>
if the US were to fill the key positions of government, industry
<br>
and the military with people from the second quartile, they would
<br>
still have extraordinary resources on which to draw.  To put this
<br>
a little more forcefully, the US would still be richer in its
<br>
problem-solving resources than Canada and the countries of the EU
<br>
combined.  When a country dedicates itself to high standards over
<br>
many generations, the results begin to tell.  As one small measure
<br>
of this, I remember coming back from one teaching meeting at HBS
<br>
and thinking to myself, &quot;This place could care half as much about
<br>
teaching, and it would still be twice as good at the nearest
<br>
competitor.&quot; The Americans have made the &quot;quality&quot; investment over
<br>
several generations.  The &quot;lead&quot; they now enjoy over other
<br>
countries is literally astonishing.
<br>
<p>The bin Laden attack has mobilized these abilities.  An attack of
<br>
this magnitude, on so public and important a target, has changed
<br>
the way Americans go to war.  It has eliminated the remaining
<br>
grounds for skepticism.  It has dismantled the argument that
<br>
American determination will vanish in the face of the real human,
<br>
financial and political costs of battle.  In an odd way, bin Laden
<br>
guaranteed his defeat when he choose his target and succeeded in
<br>
his attack upon it.  Among the things he destroyed were American
<br>
ambivalence, false scruple, and political hesitation in matters of
<br>
war. 
<br>
<p><p>We know Americans will win this war.  We know how they will do it. 
<br>
They will win it with a relentless, dispassionate application of
<br>
skill and intelligence in the short term and the long.  As a matter
<br>
of standing policy, they will strike whenever, wherever they must
<br>
to ensure a September 11th cannot happen again.  The victory will
<br>
come from courage, discipline, application, sacrifice but mostly it
<br>
will come from excellence.  The Americans will win this war because
<br>
of the way they teach.  They will win because they make better,
<br>
smarter, richer decisions that the rest of us.  They will win
<br>
because they have been dedicated for several generations to
<br>
building an economy, a military, and a culture that is deft and
<br>
powerful in its ability to respond to change.  To be sure, the
<br>
complexities of combat in the Middle East and the difficulties of
<br>
homeland defense are formidable problems.  But I have seen the
<br>
problem solvers, and, Mr. bin Laden, I have bad news, that 
<br>
hawk that's circling is circling for you.
