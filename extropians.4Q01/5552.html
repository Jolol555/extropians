<p><em>&gt;&gt;Since the Extropian movement is heavily invested in libertarian

<p>Faulty conjecture and bad memetic engineering. If some extropians are Libertarian and others Republicans, some Democrats, some are a-political, and still others non-party line thinkers, the above-statement is an untenable generalization.
<br>
<p>The Extropian movement is heavily invested in improving the human condition. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Seems as if Extropians would wish to trample
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the individual rights of most Americans by implementing open
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;borders--not to mention taking the food out of the mouths of working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;class Americans by lowering wages with immigration...or perhaps a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;weight reduction plan for the working classes is part of the Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;philosophy  :-)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The idea that advocating open 
</em><br>
borders in some way infringes the rights of those who don't
<br>
believe in them gets it exactly backward: it is the act of
<br>
excluding people that is a violation of rights; if individual
<br>
Americans don't want to allow immigration /on their own land/,
<br>
a libertarian government would enforce their property rights.
<br>
If others wanted to allow unlimited immigration on /their/
<br>
land, a libertarian government would not interfere.  In that
<br>
way, /everyone's/ rights are protected, even the isolationists.
<br>
If the isolationists don't want to allow immigration to /other
<br>
people's land/, then it is they who are overstepping their power
<br>
and imposing their will on others.  It is not the business of
<br>
a libertarian government to support people who would violate
<br>
the rights of others to do what they want with their own land.&lt;
<br>
<p>Well put Lee.  By the way, this viewpoint is shared by ideologies other than Libertarian.
<br>
<p>What about the effect of open boarders on non-tangible spaces or environments that are not restricted to terra.
