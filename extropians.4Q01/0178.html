</em><br>
<p>You are aware that most experts and FAQs on steganography discuss the fact
<br>
that being undetectable may not be possible?  This is not just an arbitrary
<br>
assumption on my part.  It really is a standard steganography topic, and
<br>
right now most of the experts seem to agree that it may not be possible.  If
<br>
anybody really invents undetectable steganography, they would probably get
<br>
rich.
<br>
<p>I don't want to discuss too many of the specific details before I get your
<br>
pictures.  However, I don't want this conversation to get stuck at the &quot;can
<br>
too&quot; &quot;can not&quot; level.  So without revealing too many details of what I plan
<br>
to do, let me describe some of my ideas for detect steganography.  There are
<br>
three main points that make my part of the challenge easier than might be
<br>
immediately apparent.
<br>
<p>1.  I don't really have to detect or predict complex random tampering.  All
<br>
I have to predict is standard JPEG output.  Given a known image and known
<br>
JPEG algorithms, it is pretty easy to predict what the output should be at
<br>
various compressions.  Anything that deviates from the predicted results
<br>
would be suspect.  99% of the pictures out on the Internet are optimized,
<br>
compressed, perfect JPEGS.  Only a small subset of them would be unusual
<br>
enough to merit further investigation.
<br>
<p>2.  I probably have your encoding algorithms.  There is currently only one
<br>
program that even claims to be able to produce undetectable steganography.
<br>
Unless you have developed your own secret algorithms, I am pretty sure that
<br>
you are planning to use outguess.  This means that I don't have to detect
<br>
any possible random tampering.  I only have to use outguess itself to see
<br>
what kind of stuff it produces.  I can compare known JPEG outputs and known
<br>
outguess outputs.  I can even look into the source code for outguess if I
<br>
need more specific details about what outguess will do or will not do.
<br>
Having the known algorithms and the known data output makes it a large but
<br>
easy problem to determine whether the algorithm would produce the data.
<br>
<p>3.  I developed a security reverse-engineering methodology for IBM for this
<br>
purpose.  They are considering pursuing a patent based on my work (aided by
<br>
my business partner and two of my IBM colleagues).  Although they sold this
<br>
to the U.S. government, I am not directly restricted from discussing this
<br>
invention of mine.  For once, one of my security inventions is not
<br>
classified top secret by the U.S. government as a matter of national
<br>
security.  This was my first big security invention since moving to the
<br>
private sector.  Although it eventually became the property of the U.S.
<br>
Government, and is probably still regarded by IBM as one of their trade
<br>
secrets, it is the first time I was able to directly profit from one of my
<br>
security methodologies.  It also is the first major achievement of mine that
<br>
I can discuss in public.  I still do not want to reveal too many details,
<br>
since IBM still is the only public-sector company with knowledge of this
<br>
technique, and I do not want to diminish its value for them.
<br>
<p>The problem I solved for IBM was meant to detect changes in program
<br>
binaries.  Unfortunately, we could not simply recompile the code to make a
<br>
trusted binary, and we did not have access to checksums or information about
<br>
what the original binary should have looked like.  My method analyzed the
<br>
compiler itself to determine what output binaries were possible.  I produced
<br>
a constraint map that could be applied to the binary.  Anything outside the
<br>
known constrains must have been added later and was not part of the original
<br>
compilation.  The added binary was not invalid, and was not analyzed
<br>
directly, but was detected as being outside the range of what would have
<br>
been normally produced.  Similarly, I think the same method will apply here.
<br>
I can predict what normal JPEGS would produce for the image.  Although
<br>
random fluxuations in low-order bits are valid and might appear as noise,
<br>
they never would really be output by the JPEG algorithm itself.  It actually
<br>
works to reduce noise, not add it.  Therefore, these extraneous bits would
<br>
appear alien even though they are defined in a valid manner.  Statistical
<br>
analysis on the image won't find these bits outside the norm from a visual
<br>
perspective.  However, analysis on the JPEG and outguess programs themselves
<br>
would show that these bits would not be produced in the absence of a hidden
<br>
message.
