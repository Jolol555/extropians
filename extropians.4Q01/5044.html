<p>I find it rather strange to dicuss plans for radical technological changes, 
<br>
including ideas to reshape the earth, the solar system and the conditions 
<br>
of living for all people on the one hand, but to give up every idea of 
<br>
mental changes on the other hand.
<br>
<p>IMO, if improved technology shall improve the quality of living for _all_ 
<br>
people (see Extropian Principles), we _have_ to improve our ethics and 
<br>
mental skills. Becoming more intelligent (solve equations and create 
<br>
technology) is not enough without becoming wiser: thinking in networks of 
<br>
dependencies, consequences and values of others, and find a common consent, 
<br>
instead of pushing interests.
<br>
<p>And we have enough examples of different ethical systems. Even societies we 
<br>
don't consider appropriate for us contain ideas which we should probably 
<br>
integrate into our repertoire. We only have to analyse them like we do a 
<br>
chemical analysis.
