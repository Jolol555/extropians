I saw &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; today and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Russell Crowe did a fine job playing the lead role of John Nash.  This true story showed how one of the greatest mathematicians of our time overcame tragic circumstances.  And despite the painful drama, there is also much humor in it.  
<br>
<p>In my opinion the film had a very well done and surprising plot, and an excellent supporting cast.  Jennifer Connelly surprised me by how well she did in the role of his wife.  And Ed Harris was good as usual.
<br>
<p>I am glad to say critics agree with me on this one! lol  I don't always see eye to eye with them.  It has gotten excellent reviews and deservedly so.
<br>
<p>There is a scene in a bar where Nash gets inspiration for his breakthrough scientific theory based on a sudden insight on how to pick up women when they are in groups!!  The way they do the scene is worth the price of admission alone. lol
<br>
<p>Let's clean our palette's of Vanilla Sky by all seeing this very touching film based on a true story.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
