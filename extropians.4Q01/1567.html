<p>This is funny: &quot;The Saudi Arabian government is so concerned it is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hiring U.S. lawyers to find Saudi citizens taken into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;custody and to represent them.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is the same government with a long record of taking Americans into
<br>
detention, torturing them, and refusing to let them see American
<br>
diplomats or legal counsel. Don't you see how they are using our own
<br>
system against us? For a terrorist, an open society is its own greatest
<br>
weakness.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the following quote exposes the bias: &quot;More than 800 people
<br>
have been arrested, and more than 360,000 tips have been pursued in the
<br>
largest U.S. criminal investigation in history. But authorities have yet
<br>
to develop evidence that anyone in custody knew of the September 11
<br>
attacks, according to The New York Times.&quot; 
<br>
<p>It is known that at least four of the detained suspects have had highly
<br>
incriminating evidence seized on their persons which implicate them in
<br>
the 9-11 attacks. One of whom was arrested after telling his flight
<br>
instructor that &quot;I don't need to know how to land or take off, I only
<br>
need to know how to fly the plane in the air.&quot; The remaining three had
<br>
had their flight on a fifth plane that day cancelled and were arrested
<br>
on a train to texas with box cutters and large amounts of cash in their
<br>
posession (Texas was not the destination of the flight that was
<br>
cancelled), indicating they were hoping to escape over the Mexican
<br>
border.
<br>
<p>The fact that the author lies about this indicates the bias of the
<br>
article, and thus it is worthless.
