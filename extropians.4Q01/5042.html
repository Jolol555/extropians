The Singularity meme is a psychological force that mediates against any form of prejudice by showing that all inequalities are temporary, even genuine inequalities; it doesn't matter who has an IQ of 130 and who has an IQ of 90 today, if both can cooperate to have an IQ of 180 in a few years.  And the *real* Singularity is a fundamentally egalitarian force because I expect the Singularity to completely ignore
<br>
the faction fights that humans spend so much time pursuing.  Nor does gray goo respect national boundaries.  We win together, or lose together.  We

are all in the same boat.

<p>Eliezer, amen to your vision of the future!!  I would love to have an intellect equal to you and other extremely bright and educated extropians.  Still, I would need years of study to catch up with you, though.  But, during that time you would all be continuing to learn, grow and implement enhancing cognitive technologies on a level I could not.  So, I would never catch up to you!!  I would be a lot further along then I am now...  A world where we are all equals in mental capacity just does not seem in any way realistic to me even with a singularity having taken place.
<br>
<p>So, despite this disagreement, I like your sentiment for having a world without the glaring deprivation, hatred and inequalities of the present world.  
<br>
<p>It would be wonderful to have a planet where humanity has put behind its tribalism.  But, if you are an educated person like Mike Lorrey who has suffered from the wonderful new global economy, don't expect an &quot;oh no problem, the future will be just great!&quot; attitude.  In Mike's suffering shoes it would not be so easy to be detached about such matters.
<br>
<p>Tomorrow many people will be celebrating the birth of a man who some say was divine and the prince of peace.  If so(I believe so), he may be showing up just as things get REALLY interesting down here.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
