<em>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, I understand it, and I do not fly into rage.

<em>&gt; But I note that, in the circa 200 messages you posted these last 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; months (which coincides with my presence here), you stated your point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of view on this topic a very large number of times almost unchanged,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I can't understand why.
</em><br>
<p>I keep trying because it is important to me.  I think that maybe
<br>
if I say it just a bit differently or with perhaps a bit more
<br>
patience or with a bit more care to not be understood then maybe
<br>
the ills of the situation can be lessened at least a little
<br>
bit.  Or maybe a few who do not see some of the downsides as I
<br>
do will see things just a bit differently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think all list members got it, whether they agree or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Apparently this is not so judging from the comments I still see
<br>
in response.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I understand the importance you attach to it, but as important as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, I don't think you will convince people who do not agree with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by massive repetition ; it will only raise their irritation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The above is why I try to say it again.  How can I be silent
<br>
when I see what looks to me like very hardened and dangerous
<br>
attitudes being expressed that greatly worry me.  Would I not be
<br>
remiss if I did not speak out?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It is not &quot;the last who talks wins the argument&quot;, and one should not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on such principle, repeat the same thing until the opponent gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silent... How is the resulting &quot;repetition flood&quot; respectful to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list members ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I said nothing I said out of disrespect.  Quite the contrary.
