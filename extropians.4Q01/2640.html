<p><p>Hello Amara,
<br>
<p>I reply to you privately because I'm no more subscribed to the extropian
<br>
list, but continue to browse the archives frequently. As you mentioned one
<br>
my intellectual heroes, I couldn't resist :)..
<br>
<p>Vernant is great. He wrote with Marcel Detienne a book which, IMHO, is
<br>
extremely interesting for people interested in transhumanism, about the
<br>
goddess Metis (Metis ou Les ruses de l'intelligence). as you probably know,
<br>
Greek viewed knowledge as a very abstract thing, and discarded strongly any
<br>
practical application; contrary to Romans, they despised technology. But
<br>
Metis is a kind of &quot;underground&quot; goddess, associated with &quot;tekne&quot; and all
<br>
kinds of practical tricks, and, because of Greek repulsion toward this
<br>
aspect of thought, appears as very ambiguous to them. Odysseus, for instance
<br>
is a &quot;metisian hero&quot;, but Odysseus, although being well-known, is much less
<br>
exemplary of the &quot;hero&quot; than Hercules or Achilles.
<br>
Of course, it would be interesting to see in Metis a &quot;Goddess&quot;,i.e. a
<br>
mythological role model, for philosophies involved in technology...
<br>
<p>As for Vernant teaching French politicians, I cannot tell you, but I seem to
<br>
remember he had been involved politically in his youth (leftist), so perhaps
<br>
he continues to have some contacts...
<br>
<p>Jacqueline de Romilly is one of the most famous historian of Greece in
<br>
France, but I don't know a lot about her (although I have probably one of
<br>
her books on my shelves, but who knows...;)
<br>
<p>Remi
