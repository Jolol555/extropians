Amara quoted me:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then I would kill everybody involved in the procurement of the nuke,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;including the electrophysiologist who made the EEG-detonator setup.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then I widely publicize my willingness and ability to continue such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actions as needed. In this way I would save even more innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lives.
</em><br>
<p>and wrote:
<br>
<p>oh Yea? I would eliminate the source of the Pu 239, going to every
<br>
nuclear power plant and taking the irradiated fuel rod cannisters
<br>
and killing all those people who work at the plants.
<br>
<p>### Excuse my bluntness, but this is a bizarre proposal - well-guarded
<br>
plutonium in power plants is an important source of energy, some of which is
<br>
contributing to your own survival. Why would you visit such a brutal fate on
<br>
the poor engineers working there (those who are not trying to skim some Pu
<br>
for sale to Al-Qauida)?
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Then I would
<br>
put those cannisters on the next Ariane rocket scheduled to launch,
<br>
and send them into space and eliminate those people at the launch site
<br>
too.
<br>
<p>### Curiouser and curiouser. 
<br>
<p>Plutonium-filled canisters on an Ariane rocket - this is really dangerous
<br>
stuff. And why do you want to kill the space engineers as well?
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
&nbsp;And just in case some Pu 239 was being transported on the
<br>
highways, I would kill every truck driver.
<br>
<p>### Huh? Truck drivers?
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Oh, and to make sure more
<br>
Pu 239 wasn't going to be transported on the roads, I would take
<br>
some explosives and  blow up all of the roads.
<br>
<p>### Then why not keep the Pu for blowing up roads!
<br>
<p><pre>
----
<p> Then to make sure the
trains didn't transport Pu 239, I would put garbage on the railroad
lines to crash the trains.
<p>### No, you don't need to crash trains - remember, you used all plutonuim
for blowing up roads. 
<p>-----
<p> Then after that, I would blow up all
off-road vehicles with their drivers.
<p>### Yes, yes, they are so noisy!
<p>----
<p> But just in case someone would
try to carry Pu 239 in their backpack on a hike, I would save more
innocent lives by blowing up all of the hikers.
<p>### Whatever.
<p>-----
<p><p> Then I would
eliminate anyone else's temptation to carry Pu 239, and blow up all
hiking paths.
<p>### Now, this is really not nice anymore.
<p>----
<p> Then just to be sure, I would starlift the outer
layers of the Sun burn the Earth to a cinder.
<p>### Magnificent!
<p>-------
<p>&gt;I could get pretty bloodthirsty with a guy waving a nuke in my face.
<p>yeah &lt;grunt grunt&gt;
<p>me too
<p>Amara
<p>### This condition is called &quot;nuke fever&quot;
