Chris Hibbert whispered from behind the arras...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On whether the rich get richer when new technologies become available:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to underscore Mike Lorrey's point.  Nearly all technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trickle down eventually, and as the pace of change has gotten faster, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has seemed to me that the trickle down has happened faster as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the points that Julian Simon constantly emphasized was that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual opponents constantly stressed how far the poor were behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rich in various measurements of access to wealth.  (longevity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to health care, susceptibility to various diseases, for example)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you instead focus on the changing statistics over time, what you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see in nearly any time series is how much the poor are catching up.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same is true over time in access to technology.
</em><br>
<p>A hard recent wrinkle due to the anti-development-as-usual camp is to try to factor in 
<br>
the &quot;lost wealth&quot; per capita in these un(der)developed lands due to exploitation. 
<br>
<p>See the appended article. I haven't actually read the paper, nor even tried to. 
<br>
But I think I can see a couple of problems with their seeming approach, one 
<br>
being their possibly not having offset the worth of the resource in putative market dollars 
<br>
by the amount of effort (overhead) which a company would have to invest in order to
<br>
bring the goods to market. Another point is that stuff just sitting there does not 
<br>
&quot;participate in the economy&quot;; one can't make a profit on it; rather like equity 
<br>
in a house. That can sound rather Ferengoid.
<br>
<p>Me, I'm concerned about what the mortgage is _for_, rather than _that there is_ a mortgage.

<p>World poverty is far worse than standard measures indicate
<br>
<p>The problem of world poverty is far worse than is indicated by standard measures of the quality of life, such as GNP per
<br>
capita and the
<br>
United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI). Indeed, measures of the true wealth of nations - their productive base of
<br>
physical,
<br>
human and natural capital - reveal that something like a third of the world's population have become even poorer over
<br>
the past three
<br>
decades. And in a cruel paradox, it may well be that contemporary economic development is unsustainable in poor
<br>
countries because
<br>
it is sustainable in rich countries.
<br>
<p>These were some of the conclusions of Professor Partha Dasgupta of the University of Cambridge, delivering ESRC's 12th
<br>
Annual
<br>
Lecture on Wednesday 17 October. Dasgupta argued that while GNP and HDI indicators suggest steady improvement over the
<br>
past
<br>
thirty years in much of the developing world, they fail to take account of what really matters for a society's
<br>
prospects: its productive
<br>
base of institutions and capital assets, including natural resources. And it seems clear that in the Indian
<br>
sub-continent, sub-Saharan
<br>
Africa and China - countries and regions that together encompass half the world's population - this has been declining
<br>
relative to their
<br>
populations.
<br>
<p>Dasgupta's rough and ready calculations of per capita wealth show how misleading the assessment of long-term economic
<br>
development can be by simply looking at GNP per capita or HDI. For example, Pakistan's GNP per capita grew at a healthy
<br>
2.7 percent
<br>
per year, implying a more than doubling of living standards in the period 1965-96. The per capita wealth measure shows
<br>
that living
<br>
standards actually almost halved for the average Pakistani over this period.
<br>
<p>For sub-Saharan Africa, the picture is even worse according to per capita wealth measures, with living standards halving
<br>
after only
<br>
twenty years. The ills of this continent are well known but they are rarely depicted in terms of such a massive decline
<br>
in wealth. It will
<br>
take years for the region to recover, if it is able to do so at all.
<br>
<p>At the heart of Dasgupta's lecture was the idea of sustainable development, signalled by an increase in a country's
<br>
wealth over time
<br>
and signifying an increase in economic well-being. Given that, properly measured to include environmental degradation, a
<br>
vast swathe
<br>
of the developing world is growing less wealthy in per capita terms while countries like the UK and the US are growing
<br>
wealthier, it
<br>
might be cruelly inferred that poor countries are consuming beyond their means while rich countries are not consuming
<br>
enough. But
<br>
the issue is far more complex than that.
<br>
<p>Key features of the depletion of these countries' productive base are the resources that make up natural capital:
<br>
commercial forests, oil
<br>
and minerals, water, fisheries, soil, biodiversity, the atmosphere as a sink for carbon dioxide, etc. And owing to
<br>
imperfect systems of
<br>
property rights, these are typically under priced or free to those who use them. This means that countries exporting
<br>
primary products
<br>
(and they are often among the poorest) may well be subsidising the consumption of the importing countries (typically the
<br>
richest).
<br>
This suggests that contemporary economic development may well be unsustainable in poor countries because it is
<br>
sustainable in rich
<br>
countries.
