All these alleged 'ethics experts' claim that there is some moral reason against reproductive cloning, but I've never actually seen anyone detail the philosophical principles for such a claim. Can anyone point to some arguments against reproductive cloning that are not just &quot;because it's so&quot; statements?

<br>
Back when Dolly was cloned I emailed Dr Caplan, the bioethicist at U.Penn who seemed to oppose cloning but he was unable to present any coherent arguments against it. The old &quot;human dignity&quot; trick seems to one of the concepts that sound very nice but when you get into details it totally falls apart.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Whether or not you believe their are valid arguments against it, the American public seems to be embracing these views.  Or at least to the point of feeling very unsettled over the entire matter.  
<br>
<p>On occasion I enjoy listening to the Art Bell show.  Guests like Bart Kosko and Ralph Merkle are quite something.  And even guests of a more esotoric nature can be simply fun.  
<br>
<p>Art has the first hour of the show be a chance for callers to give their views on current events.  Lately, cloning has been the hot topic.  The overwhelming majority of callers are either very nervous about cloning, or just plain outraged.  
<br>
<p>One of the arguments is theological/&quot;Night of the Living Dead.&quot;  A lot of callers wonder if these clones will have souls.  Even as a believer myself in God and an afterlife, I find this rediculous!!  The concern is that clones will be made to be &quot;soul-less&quot; soldiers or corporate enforcers.  I think some people meant literally without a soul, while others used it as a metaphor for being genetically engineered to be without emotion and sentiment.  
<br>
<p>Several people claiming to have terminal diseases said they would rather die than have cloning technology of any sort slow or cure their condition.  There is a lot of anger in these voices.
<br>
<p>I realize this is the Art Bell show, but I think these guests are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a large minority at the very least in the public population who are deadset against this research. 
<br>
<p>I think even if Pro-Act had a hundred million dollar endowment, they would have a serious uphill battle with this one.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
