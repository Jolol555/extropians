Practical Life Extension, Part 1.2, Urgencies
<br>
<p>The earlier advice about starting with health, psychology, 
<br>
and efficiency does not apply if you are faced with urgent 
<br>
problems more important than minor changes to your health, 
<br>
psychology, and efficiency.   Your health or psychology can 
<br>
themselves be an urgent problem.  Efficiency is unlikely to 
<br>
be an urgency but the more urgent things are, the more 
<br>
important it is that you be efficient.
<br>
<p>An important urgency is something which will significantly 
<br>
effect some important aspect of your (or someone's) life 
<br>
and which you may be able to do something positive about if 
<br>
you act soon (quickly, efficiently, etc.).  If you can not 
<br>
influence it don't sweat it.  If it is not as important as 
<br>
minor changes to your health, psychology, or efficiency, 
<br>
don't sweat it until you get those running smoothly.
<br>
<p>Even if you are a fairly generous person consider being a 
<br>
little selfish here.  You will never be able to help as 
<br>
many people or help them as much if you do not do a good 
<br>
job looking out for your own health, psychology, and 
<br>
efficiency.  Triage is not pleasant but it beats the 
<br>
alternatives.
<br>
<p>Some possible urgencies are, medical problems, suicidal 
<br>
impulses, moving towards major psychiatric disorders, 
<br>
things that will save or cost you a lot of time or energy, 
<br>
significant and easy changes to your income or financial 
<br>
well being, rare opportunities for something really 
<br>
important, physical hazards, likely accidents, likely 
<br>
violence, a war or unrest which affects you directly (or 
<br>
which you can do something significant about), sufficiently 
<br>
important political issues, rapidly evolving legal 
<br>
problems, fires, disasters, etc.
<br>
<p>Preparing for unlikely urgencies is not urgent compared to 
<br>
working on your health, psychology, and efficiency because 
<br>
there are so many possibilities that preparing for them all 
<br>
will take a long time and be easier if you are at your 
<br>
best.  The same principle applies to dealing with important 
<br>
long-term goals.  Get the ball rolling on your health, 
<br>
psychology, and efficiency and keep working on them anytime 
<br>
you can make significant improvements.  In the long run a 
<br>
little bit of time spent on these three things will help 
<br>
you reach all of your other goals.  I'll talk about how 
<br>
much time to spend on them later.  The answer is neither 
<br>
none nor all day.
<br>
<p>Some urgencies are obvious and some are not (obviously).  
<br>
There are urgencies in the world, which you do not know 
<br>
about.  Things that may effect you which you do not know 
<br>
about.  Do not try at this point to figure them all out.  
<br>
Most people would find that overwhelming.  And once again, 
<br>
there are many of them so focus on your long-term 
<br>
performance.  Many people will die today.  You may die 
<br>
today.  Live with it.  However there are some things worth 
<br>
keeping your eye on.  And if you see a significant positive 
<br>
difference you can make, do it.
<br>
<p>Look for a source of local news.  AM radio news stations or 
<br>
talk stations often have the most up to the minute news.  A 
<br>
few minutes at the right time of the hour a few times a day 
<br>
will keep you more informed than most people.  A local 
<br>
daily or weekly paper will also give you some news focused 
<br>
on your area.  For now look for urgencies.  Things that 
<br>
could significantly effect you soon, which you can do 
<br>
something about.  A local Internet news sight also may do a 
<br>
good job of keeping you informed.  I will say a lot more 
<br>
about news later.  For now just avoid being an ostrich.  If 
<br>
you flip on the radio, tune three or four local am news or 
<br>
talk stations and hear nothing urgent odds are there is no 
<br>
urgent important news.
<br>
<p>Another way to check on news is to say hi to your friends 
<br>
every now and then and ask them what is important to them 
<br>
lately.  They are your friends, so you want to help when 
<br>
you can easily do so.  While you are at it, share your 
<br>
current interests with them and see if they have anything 
<br>
to offer.  Friends can also pass on general news.  When you 
<br>
are out and about asking people what's new or what they 
<br>
think is important may net you some news or ideas.
<br>
<p>Try to stay aware of your surroundings.  Your surroundings 
<br>
are about five or ten light years but closer things tend to 
<br>
affect you more often.  Missiles, diseases, wars, etc. can 
<br>
travel the globe quickly so pay some attention to what is 
<br>
going on.  If you hear a commotion, alarms, etc. cautiously 
<br>
check it out until you figure out what is going on or 
<br>
decide on some prudent action.  Try to stay as aware as 
<br>
practical of the sensory (sounds, smells, tactile 
<br>
sensations, and sights, in your environment.  See if you 
<br>
can expand your range and awareness.  Don't be paranoid.  
<br>
Most of what you sense will be pleasant and relaxing or of 
<br>
no concern to you but sometimes you will benefit from 
<br>
knowing what is going on sooner rather than later.
<br>
<p>There are also many lesser urgencies, appointments, work, 
<br>
bills, favors, opportunities, romance, classes, moving.  
<br>
Rearranging your schedule to do these things may make 
<br>
sense, putting off minor heath or psychology issues for a 
<br>
few days may make sense sometimes.  There may be 
<br>
compromises to be made.  However, none of these things 
<br>
should interfere with paying attention to your basic 
<br>
health, psychology, or efficiency.  Be careful not to let 
<br>
your life become a series of pseudo emergencies.  Think 
<br>
about which things will be most important over the years 
<br>
and learn to let some things go.  Whether you are an inmate 
<br>
in a forced labor prison camp or the master of a chateau on 
<br>
the French Riviera in the absence of urgencies (plotting an 
<br>
escape or taking a rare stroll on the beach) health, 
<br>
psychology, and efficiency are a good place to start.
