<p>Following the Script by Joseph Sobran
<br>
<p>Assuming that Osama bin Laden directed the 9/11 attack, how does he feel
<br>
today?
<br>
<p>Is he sitting in a cave biting his nails and moaning: &quot;Oh dear! What have I
<br>
done? Now the Americans are really angry, and they are only too likely to
<br>
strike back! Why didn't I think of that possibility?&quot;
<br>
<p>Or is he saying: &quot;Just as we hoped. Bush is following the script we wrote.
<br>
Of course we knew the Americans would take the bait! That was our whole
<br>
design! Soon there will be open war between the infidels and Islam&quot;?
<br>
<p>If this is war, it makes World War II look as quaint as an
<br>
eighteenth-century pistol duel at 20 paces. Our enemy is not a state with a
<br>
central nervous system we can strike at, but a vexingly decentralized
<br>
organization. It's a perverse twist on the principles of the free market and
<br>
federalism, and President Bush, threatening to &quot;eradicate&quot; terrorism, is
<br>
rather like a socialist central planner threatening to eradicate a black
<br>
market.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States is taking frantic precautions, at enormous
<br>
cost, to prevent the recurrence of a unique event. Whatever the enemy has up
<br>
its sleeve, it won't do the same thing next time. Knowing we are now on
<br>
guard against quadruple hijackings, it will find another way to surprise us.
<br>
<p>We are dealing with men who are willing to die in order to hurt us. Tough
<br>
talk may console the American public, but it's entirely beside the point.
<br>
What is the use of threatening fanatics with violence? What is it about the
<br>
word &quot;suicide&quot; we don't understand?
<br>
<p>Moreover, the 9/11 attack may mark a dreadful threshold. The whole world has
<br>
now seen that the sole remaining superpower is by no means invulnerable.
<br>
This can only encourage other potential enemies to try their hand. It's
<br>
rather like the four-minute mile: as soon as one man broke it, everyone did.
<br>
It no longer seemed the outer limit of human achievement. From now on we
<br>
must watch our backs everywhere on earth.
<br>
<p>Since the real enemy is elusive, the natural response of a wounded state is
<br>
to seek a tangible target - another state - to strike at. So our government
<br>
is holding the Afghan government responsible for harboring bin Laden and is
<br>
threatening military reprisals unless he is captured and given up to the
<br>
United States.
<br>
<p>This assumes that the rulers of Afghanistan know exactly where bin Laden is
<br>
and can easily arrest him, if only they want to. Should we make war on such
<br>
a dubious assumption? If we do, we may find ourselves fighting the entire
<br>
Muslim world, roughly a billion people, with incalculable consequences, and
<br>
with Osama bin Laden and his cohorts fading into the background of a third
<br>
world war. Our primary mission will become subduing countless people who
<br>
have nothing to do with him, but who will be united in their hatred of us.
<br>
The original cause may be almost forgotten, as we pay a vastly greater price
<br>
for the war than we paid last week.
<br>
<p>World War II began with the invasion of Poland; fifty million deaths later,
<br>
it ended with Poland in the firm possession of one of the aggressors. The
<br>
irony was lost on the exhausted Western &quot;victors.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;That men set off a course of events they can neither calculate nor
<br>
control,&quot; wrote the great Shakespeare commentator A.C. Bradley, &quot;is a tragic
<br>
fact.&quot; Nearly every war turns out to be far more than we bargained for. The
<br>
Gulf War seemed like an easy victory, at the time; we won in a few weeks,
<br>
and for ten years we thought we were living happily ever after. Now it
<br>
appears to have made us implacable and cunning enemies.
<br>
<p>Of course the enemy doesn't know how events will play out either, but it is
<br>
too reckless to care. It represents the nemesis of the modern state, too
<br>
weak to conquer but satisfied with the stupendous disruption it can achieve.
<br>
And because that enemy is not a state, there is probably no coin in which it
<br>
can be repaid.
<br>
<p>The enemy has done the unexpected. Our own government has done only the
<br>
expected. There is no doubt who is winning, or who holds the upper hand.
