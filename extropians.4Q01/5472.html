<p>
After a busy two weeks in Beijing, I'm sitting at the desk in my office at
<br>
home, enjoying a cup of good American coffee (I know my European friends
<br>
will think that's a contradiction in terms), working my way through over
<br>
1,200 backed up emails and grateful for the easy availability of melatonin.
<br>
My return to China came almost exactly 23 years (TWENTY THREE YEARS!) after
<br>
my last sojourn there, and I'm pleased to report that China is
<br>
exemplifying -- in most respects -- an explosion of extropian values
<br>
throughout society.  Perhaps the primary impressions I'd pass on to the
<br>
group here are three.
<br>
<p>First, China is experiencing what must surely be the most accelerated and,
<br>
in sheer numbers, largest instance of urbanization in human history.  The
<br>
visual landscape of Beijing has been utterly transformed: For as far as the
<br>
eye can see in any direction from countless points around the now
<br>
much-larger city, I saw rank after rank of mid-rise and high-rise buildings,
<br>
almost all built within the last ten years.  This vision is certainly one
<br>
that wouldn't be out of place in many science fiction stories, given the
<br>
wildly syncretistic styles of architecture and the simple newness of all the
<br>
buildings.
<br>
<p>Second, while the central government and highest levels of political life in
<br>
China are certainly NOT democratic, there has also been a breathtaking
<br>
flowering of human freedom in China.  At every level of society, I saw many,
<br>
many instances, large and small, of an exuberant new enjoyment of liberty.
<br>
This is expressed in many ways: Free markets of small vendors have formed
<br>
spontaneously in many places and, after initial attempts by the government
<br>
to suppress them failed, they are now tolerated and, in many cases, even
<br>
encouraged; state-owned enterprises are being sold off as fast as the
<br>
government can organize the process; people now accept some insecurity and a
<br>
steady end to the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; of permanent, unconditional employment as
<br>
the price of innovation and liberty; there is a great hunger for learning
<br>
the ways of legality and mutuality instead of command and authority and, in
<br>
situations as diverse as road traffic, lines at theaters and cash registers
<br>
and business deals, there is a development of a new, voluntary civil
<br>
society.
<br>
<p>Third, the genie of cultural change is definitely out of the bottle.
<br>
Chinese television and other visual arts media have become a seething
<br>
hothouse of syncretistic creativity, swiftly adopting elements of a global
<br>
culture of symbols and syntax; new trends in literature and criticism are
<br>
developing faster than the established literati can keep track; throughout
<br>
the culture there is an exuberant xenophilia that finds expression in an
<br>
unselfconscious experimentation at levels from the largest public displays
<br>
of communication to street slang and business manners.  Throughout all of
<br>
this runs a reservoir of potent optimism and good humor that stands in sharp
<br>
contrast to the weary socialist seriousness I knew when I began studying
<br>
China and Chinese culture and contemporary history almost three decades ago.
<br>
<p>As an extropian, I found all this deeply satisfying and endlessly
<br>
fascinating.  One question I put to my Chinese friends and colleagues was
<br>
whether the pace of change they were experiencing was somehow frightening or
<br>
tiring.  Interestingly, there was very little negative reaction.  Put
<br>
simply, the direction of change and its rewards have been so positive for so
<br>
many people -- and so obviously and tangibly so -- that no one I spoke to
<br>
expressed real reservations or regret.  The speed with which real prosperity
<br>
has percolated throughout Chinese society has made the swift change easy to
<br>
take.  The flowering of opportunity has more than offset the loss of
<br>
security.  There are definitely concerns about whether China, as a whole and
<br>
as a society, can adopt new ways of managing its civil society.  But these
<br>
concerns are tempered by deep-seated and thoroughgoing optimism.
<br>
<p>On a personal note, this trip was extremely successful -- both for the
<br>
specific case I'm working on now, and more generally for my prospects of
<br>
working with the Chinese legal community that is now experiencing an
<br>
explosive growth of numbers, creativity and optimistic hard work.  As a
<br>
result, I'll be busier than ever in '02 in my professional work and
<br>
therefore may be even more quiet here than I have been over the last year.
<br>
So I'm very grateful to the new infusion of talent and energy we're
<br>
experiencing in the management of ExI, and look forward to working with the
<br>
folks who have recently come into the process of helping ExI to fulfill its
<br>
mission.  We've got more reason than ever to be rationally optimistic!
<br>
<p>Onward!
