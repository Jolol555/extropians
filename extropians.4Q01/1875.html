</em><br>
<p>Strawman.  Limited resources could not be wasted on every potential
<br>
contact, and stealth would also argue against overt action of that sort,
<br>
lest the object of surveillance notice that everyone he talks to gets
<br>
yanked into the shadows like a bad episode of &quot;Get Smart&quot;.  On the other
<br>
hand, I *would* like to see a clear devlaration of war, so that the
<br>
civil liberity infringements would be clearly identified and have a
<br>
reasonble prospect of coming to an end.  This damn vague executive
<br>
branch not-quite-war without a congressional declaration is a step down
<br>
a slippery slope.  War powers should not be granted so lightly.
<br>
<p>On the gripping hand, noncitizens do not have the full benefits of being
<br>
one of &quot;the people&quot; under constitutional protections.  It has long been
<br>
SOP to indefinately detain foreign nationals without habeas corpus; the
<br>
Mariel Boatlift cuban prison sweepings that Castro cleverly shuffled in
<br>
are a good example- many of them are *still* in detention.  Some,
<br>
perhaps many, of these people are innocent victims of a kafkaesque
<br>
miscarriage of justice (Tam Minh Tran is a prime example, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.refugees.org/world/articles/detention_rr99_1.htm">http://www.refugees.org/world/articles/detention_rr99_1.htm</a>).  Is that
<br>
an argument against using INS to detain terrorism suspects for a
<br>
moderate time?  No, the issues are separate; the problems with the
<br>
IIRIRA can be, and eventually will, be corrected.
<br>
<p>I guess the point I'm rambling toward is that, yes, injustices *will*
<br>
occur in trying to defend against this concerted attack on freedom- but
<br>
these will not destroy it.
