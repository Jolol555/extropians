<em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Afghanistan%20after%20the%20war&In-Reply-To=&lt;200111101423.GAA29971@well.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;George W. Bush says he isn't interested in &quot;nation-building&quot;.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;read this to mean that after the war, Afghanistan will be left to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become a rotting hellhole that will shortly fall prey to yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another religious warlord.
</em><br>
<p>Dr Condoleeza Rice was on the telly this morning and said that the
<br>
aftermath in Afghanistan cannot be a U.S. only solution, that the
<br>
U.N. will have to be involved heavily.
<br>
<p>Damn good sense.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Nation-building is the only strategy that ever worked for America. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is only natural to suppose that America will never use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again.  The only hope for the Afghans is that the war drags on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until 2005 and we get a better President.
</em><br>
<p><p>Nation building could incite the rest of the Muslim world,
<br>
especially if the Afghans's are doing better than they are. A
<br>
&quot;mouse-that-roared&quot; situation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If it were up to me, I'd say go in with the troops and rebuild
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan.  Lay down roads.  Cart in modular housing and erect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it as fast as possible.  Build factories.  Build farms full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easy-to-operate modernized farming equipment.  I don't think we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could transform it into a First World country overnight, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;takes an educated populace, but - if only we were interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nation-building - we could just build a new nation where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan used to be, and the Afghan military forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly couldn't stop us.  It would at least be worth trying.
</em><br>
<p><p>As a long time Bucky Fuller fan this sounds like a great idea, but
<br>
I think future aid ought to be directly tied to what they're going
<br>
to build. No democracy? Less money. No universal suffrage? Less
<br>
money, etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Sigh.  Don't you wish McCain was in office right now?
</em><br>
<p>Heck no! Have you been reading what's been coming out of that guy?
<br>
He ought to switch parties. He's been off my A-list for awhile...
