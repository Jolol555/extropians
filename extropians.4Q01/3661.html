<br>
<p><p>The Palestinians ought to count themselves damm lucky to get
<br>
anything at all.
<br>
<p>They declared war and attacked their neighbors trying to wipe them
<br>
off the planet, and instead they get their ass kicked and lost
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p><p>### Which war do you mean? Isn't it the Zionist movement in the late 1940's,
<br>
which was responsible for the expropriation of Palestinians from their land?
<br>
Their subsequent actions - feeble, disorganized attempts at war, as well as
<br>
stupid and self-defeating terrorism - are an answer to the initial Zionist
<br>
action, supported to some extent by Russia. Palestinians lost their land and
<br>
they might as well admit it, but there is no reason to support the other
<br>
side, either - by now both are up to their elbows in each other's blood. In
<br>
this case, neither one is in any way morally superior (and let me just
<br>
remark I am not a moral relativist, there are many cases of good vs. evil,
<br>
but not here), and I doubt that there are US national interest issues
<br>
involved there. 
<br>
<pre>
----
<p>The problem about who's land it is, is the fact that it was Jewish
land in ancient times before it was Palestinian, it's that old
argument.
<p>### I do not believe that ancient claims to land should be acknowledged in
any way - the only claim to land is one gained by growing up there or by
being accepted by the land's current owners. If you leave your land (under
duress or on your own accord), your children who are born somewhere else
have no claim to that land anymore.
