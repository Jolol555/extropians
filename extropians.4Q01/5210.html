<em>&gt; Ah, I see. This would mean, that US americans are about four times more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violent and potential criminals than citizens of other western countries.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, sure... that's what it means. ...and don't forget George Bush is from
<br>
Texas, so watch out... &quot;Don't mess with Texas&quot; as the road signs say.
<br>
Holy sheep dip! It's wonderful living here in the US with all these violent
<br>
potential criminals. Perhaps that's why the likes of Stalin and Mao Zedong
<br>
could never get a foothold here. Of course Mao and Stalin were not violent
<br>
criminals, were they? No, they believed in gun control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hm. The USA a 3rd world country?
</em><br>
<p>Nope, we're a fourth world country. There's the old world, the new world, the
<br>
cyber world, and then there's the extropian world... with headquarters right
<br>
here in the real world of USA.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hm. This brings Mikes argument about not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trusting non-residents and immigrants back into mind. Europe, Asia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia should, following this argument, not trust US citizens to behave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to our civil, low crime society here and restrict visas and such.
</em><br>
<p>Europe, Asia, and Australia have been quite restrictive about immigration.
<br>
IIRC Australia only recently lifted restrictions on immigration. Do you know
<br>
what year it was that Australia finally lifted immigration restrictions?

<br>
&lt;&lt;according to current regulations the majority of siblings have to be
<br>
resident in Australia to qualify as sponsors of their parent(s). Some parents
<br>
have little chance of entering Australia at all because they come from
<br>
countries whose residents are considered by Australian immigration authorities
<br>
to be at risk of overstaying if they are admitted to Australia. Therefore,
<br>
nationals from those countries are not even granted visitors' visas. If
<br>
parents do come to Australia, once again, migrants are confronted with a
<br>
myriad of difficulties and expenses. &gt;&gt;

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
