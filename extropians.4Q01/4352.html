Smigrodzki, Rafal wrote (14.12.2001/16:33) :
<br>
<em>&gt; The second is distinction between distinct objects, possibly similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and in fact possibly, at least in theory, identical), which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere in the very basic layers of common sense --- and routinely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used in science, too, of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### This distinction is irrelevant to our discussion - I do know that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy is a distinct physical object, not identical to myself, but for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes of my survival this copy is as good (a subjective value statement)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as myself, just like a quarter is as good any other quarter for the purpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of buying a can of Coke.
</em><br>
<p><p>Suppose a scientist analyzes your body, and makes two identical
<br>
copies, Rafal #2 and Rafal #3, while you are re-named Rafal #1.
<br>
Suppose he is very evil (« science sans conscience », you know), has a
<br>
gun and tells you « I will now kill, either you Rafal #1, or the two
<br>
others #2 and #3 ; you choose. » What will you choose ?
<br>
<p>The position you just stated seems to imply you must choose to be
<br>
killed ; while I rather think you will choose to survive and have the
<br>
two copies killed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Proper names like &quot;Lee Daniel Crocker&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designate a singular entity, not a class, not a design. It is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common name, it is not an abstraction. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I do hope that when copying technology is perfected I will multiply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds or thousands of copies. Each one of me will be able to offer my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional services as &quot;Rafal M. Smigrodzki, copy# XXXX&quot;. My proper name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will stop being a name used to describe the 154 lb of flesh where I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; housed now - it will be a brand name for all of me. Employers will hire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, maybe saying, &quot;Let's get a few Rafals and a couple Lee Daniel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crockers, they seem to work well together&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think most people now would not think like that and would not try to
<br>
make numerous copies of themselves, in fact.
<br>
<p>But on the other hand, it seems obvious that a few will -- like the
<br>
one who wrote the message I am answering now :-) If they happen to be
<br>
able to do so (because the technology exists, and because it will be
<br>
allowed, or its forbiddance will not be enforced), then they will be
<br>
like the first self-copier molecules (replicators) that started life.
<br>
They will quickly overnumber the other ones, as all copies will
<br>
themselves (as they are identical and so have identical desires)
<br>
strive for such self-copy. If you are the only person to do so, very
<br>
soon we will have more Rafals than anything else in this universe. You
<br>
make thousands copies of yourself, each one makes thousands copies of
<br>
himself, and so son. With nanotech generations could take one day,
<br>
until there is not matter left (or until Rafals prefer to respect some
<br>
patterns of matters over using them to make self-copies).
<br>
<p>Should we imagine that ? Should we keep the parallelism and imagine
<br>
mutations arising in the copies, so that the desire to be copied
<br>
becomes more and more natural, and people in the end become MAINLY
<br>
concerned with self-copy as we have long been with procreation ? How
<br>
do you see a future with this technology available ? (this is by the
<br>
way, not as an objection to your position of course)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  If you introduce the &quot;you/me&quot; pronoun, and the fictional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unity that this imply, then you must say that YOU ARE THAT LUMP OF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MATTER.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### No, I am not - I am an information processing pattern housed currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that lump of flesh. I am software. You might construe your own identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as hardware - it's a personal value judgement.
</em><br>
<p><p>This I find very weird indeed, Rafal.
<br>
<p>The brain emerged and evolved to coordinate the body. For you to
<br>
identify now with your information processing ability seems
<br>
problematic to me, and I suspect you are victim of an illusion there :
<br>
you identify on a conceptual level to this, but this may be because
<br>
you neglect other aspects of yourself that you would quickly miss. (to
<br>
say the least)
<br>
<p>How come does one get to the stage of an animal with a centralized
<br>
nervous system to help him to adapt to a stage where the animal IS the
<br>
centralized nervous system. Does &quot;centralized nervous system&quot; even
<br>
mean anything outside of a body ? Is it any use at all ? What will you
<br>
DO ? Will you program into yourself goals not linked with your body ?
<br>
Based on what ?
<br>
<p>You're not a &quot;dualist&quot;, thinking that you really are a soul
<br>
trapped in a body ? « Soma sèma » [the body is a grave] ? Back to
<br>
Descartes, or in fact Plato ?
<br>
<p>The very phrase &quot;an embodiement of me&quot; that you use in your message
<br>
seems wrong to me, it is the kind of fallacy made by people believing
<br>
in reincarnation. You are a body (with information processing
<br>
abilities among others), not something embodied. You are given to
<br>
yourself, in introspection, as a mind. But that is not what you
<br>
actually are. This mind is just a useful illusion to help the body
<br>
take care of itself. You cannot separate it from the body it is part
<br>
of.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I still hope that if I use the mantra &quot;personal value judgement&quot;, or &quot;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter of taste&quot;, I will be finally able to convince people not to try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force me to accept their &quot;objective&quot; ideas of what is me, R.M. Smigrodzki.
</em><br>
<p><p>I definitely do not want to force you to accept anything. What I want
<br>
is to see if you keep believing what you say after you develop it
<br>
more; and to see if I keep believing what I believe in the same time.
<br>
<p><p>Some more thoughts :
<br>
<p>I don't believe in continuity of consciousness being a condition for
<br>
individual survival, because I don't believe in continuity of
<br>
consciousness at all. Wheter you have taken 250 micrograms of Propofol
<br>
per minute or not seems irrelevant to me. Continuity is a fable for
<br>
everyday people, too. At each moment we have the ability of recalling
<br>
who we are, and this is what produces this notion of continuity, but
<br>
it is an illusion. It is a bit the same illusion you have with the
<br>
visual field : you think you see much more than you actually do,
<br>
simply because when you want to check that you see something in your
<br>
peripheral visual field, then you look at it and you see it, and so
<br>
you never get conscious of any hole in the visual field (in the same
<br>
way as you are able to recall what's your name, where you live, what
<br>
you do for a living, etc.) You need an experimental setup to
<br>
indirectly realize that there really are holes in you visual field.
<br>
You can never SEE the holes. (an absence of perception doesn't produce
<br>
the perception of an absence)
<br>
<p>I have no difficulty either in understanding that someone would be happy
<br>
to have copies of himself made. As I said, it is after all something
<br>
like that that happens with procreation, which tends to the survival
<br>
of copies (of genes and corresponding features).
<br>
<p>I don't have children, but I may have some. If the technology is
<br>
available, I may also make a few copies of myself to make sure that
<br>
the Jacques-adventure goes on, and that the destruction of one of us
<br>
doesn't prevent it to go on. So in this I think I understand your
<br>
desire and actually share it (though maybe not to the point of wanting
<br>
to make thousands of copies of myself, with many of them working in
<br>
the same company, with or without Lee Daniel Crocker as a colleague :-)).
<br>
<p>But I still think you are saying more than you can afford to believe
<br>
by giving the same value to yourself and your copies.
<br>
