<em>&gt; &gt; A tolerant society allows all ideas to be expressed; it even allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actions many people find objectionable so long as they are done with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consent of all parties affected, but even the most liberal society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot tolerate coercive and violent actions except in self-defense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and even to most peaceful society must occasionally itself respond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to such actions with defensive force.  It is not acceptable to allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; murderers to run free, for example; they must be forcibly detained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and prevented from killing others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if a particular meme is acted upon with high frequency, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action is a violent one? What if a promoter of this meme moves in next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to you, should you seek to stop them or wait until the meme spread and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is acted upon and then defend against or avenge each individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action?
</em><br>
<p>If every time the action is taken, someone goes to jail, that will
<br>
eventually have an effect on the meme.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Eli's point is quite valid: a tolerant society in which ideas are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expressed freely will result in better technologies, including those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technologies that are useful for defense.  And such a society will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recognize that using them is necessary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A tolerant society will by its nature also relinquish certain very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective weapons it invents, such as mind control and germ warfare.
</em><br>
<p>Not if it's tolerant enough that I can say something about it.  I
<br>
absolutely reject the idea that any technology should be relinquished,
<br>
_especially_ those useful for self-defense.  If mind control, germ
<br>
warfare, nuclear weapons, nanotech, interrogation drugs, or any other
<br>
technology becomes necessary for self-defense, I would not oppose it.
<br>
Of course many of these things pose a risk to ourselves and our
<br>
freedoms as well, so using them wisely can be difficult.  But even
<br>
if we do have to forgo some of them (mind control is the most obvious
<br>
dangerous example), there will be others.  None of this will happen
<br>
overnight; we're talking about effects that happen over generations
<br>
(though that timeline will speed up in the future as well).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not talking about evil here. I'm merely saying that if any amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of secrecy or fiat rule is necessary to the survival of a society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it will be leveraged by those in on the secret for personal gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to the detriment of the society that entrusted them with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secret. Since you disagree with my premise that secrecy is necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a society's survival (and I don't blame you, I'm not sure I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's actually necessary-- I just see that it's omnipresent) we can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really debate point 1a at this point.
</em><br>
<p>OK, expressed that way you have more of a point.  You're right, I
<br>
think &quot;secrecy&quot; is one of those dangerous weapons that might be useful
<br>
in defense but that can endanger the freedoms we're trying to defend.
<br>
Whether or not using it (or the others) is necessary is a good
<br>
question, but again it's only a question of time before other new
<br>
technologies come along.  In the meantime, I can agree that there is
<br>
a concern about these technologies being misused.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's keep in mind that any one of these setbacks could usher in a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dark Ages that will delay the singularity by a couple of generations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halt life extension research, and/or destroy your cryo-provider's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to maintain the temperature of your DeWar.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  The short term is a bitch.  And we live in the short term.
<br>
Kinda sucks for us visionaries. :-)
