<em>&gt; &gt; We are not able today to make biological changes, but we can support

<em>&gt; &gt; exist under the law.  Corporations, partnerships, marriages and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; groupings should be allowed to be treated as individuals when they choose,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In one word, NO. Corporations do not create anything through their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagination. The individuals do so to greater and lesser degrees. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; janitor doesn't create a building or machine design, doesn't design a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logo or ad campaign. The secretary doesn't create a business plan or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program an application. It is individual human beings who create.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a family, the preexisting children, the in-laws, etc do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute one whit to the actual creation of a baby. That is the job of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the husband and wife. They are the ones who are the artists, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creators, and therefore they are the ones with the rights in respect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their creation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any creation of art should be credited to those individuals who created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, in proportion to the degree of their original creative contribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the final result, and any financial gain from the sale of said art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be in proportion to their respective degree of contribution.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so... but if you've ever been fortunate to work with a really good
<br>
creative team, the lines and proportions blur so much that accurate
<br>
attribution is impossible.  This doesn't prevent distribution and shared
<br>
ownership though, just that some of that ownership is sold to outsiders
<br>
to raise the money to bring the concepts to fruition.  Without the
<br>
corporation, the imaginations of its participants could not have been
<br>
put to use.
<br>
<p>I don't have a problem with this...
