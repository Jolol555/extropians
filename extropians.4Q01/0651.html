<p>
I've been wondering about the problem of finding bin Laden
<br>
and bringing him to justice.  Obviously the 5+ million dollar
<br>
price on his head hasn't worked so far.  It is reasonable to
<br>
assume this is in part due to fear of reprisals for whomever
<br>
provides the evidence that allows his capture.  But in part
<br>
it seems to me due to the fact that anyone who might weigh
<br>
in on the side of providing information to capture him (say
<br>
someone facing starvation) lacks the means to communicate
<br>
the crucial information regarding his whereabouts to the
<br>
people who can do something with it.
<br>
<p>Now, it would seem to me that a combination of satellite
<br>
phones, witness protection programs and perhaps telephone
<br>
access to &quot;known&quot; authoritative Islamic authorities might fix
<br>
this.  Air-drop satellite phones with clear instructions
<br>
on how to use them.  Allow people in Afganistan to talk
<br>
to educated Islamic moderates who can effectively counter
<br>
the bin Laden propaganda.  Then those individuals would
<br>
be morally comfortable in providing the information needed
<br>
to capture bin Laden.  If they are guaranteed &quot;removal&quot; from
<br>
the situation, future protection, and the reward -- I think
<br>
one would find a large number information sources.
<br>
<p>It may also be time to up the reward -- a look at the hit
<br>
on the impact to the U.S. and world economy, the costs
<br>
being spent on capturing him seems to suggest that $5M
<br>
is chump change.
<br>
<p>(And for Anders -- as to why this message is extropic -- the net
<br>
negative impact on world resources as we attempt to secure ourselves
<br>
is huge.  Resources dedicated to securing ourselves from untrustable
<br>
individuals are resources that cannot be dedicated to extropic
<br>
efforts.  How much of the funds that will go into the military
<br>
campaigns, increased security precautions, shifts of resources
<br>
from the Natl. Institutes of Health to the Dept. of Defense, etc.
<br>
is difficult to say.  I would argue that the longer bin Laden
<br>
remains an unconstrained entity -- the slower the growth of
<br>
extropic developments will be.)
<br>
<p>The post is also extropic from the perspective that by pointing
<br>
out how we might achieve more open communications and greater
<br>
information access we may defeat forces that oppose such ideas.
<br>
(Though I will agree it is going to be *really* hard to reverse
<br>
the brain-washing that radical Islamic schools are promoting.)
<br>
(Here one starts to wonder if a drug could be developed whose
<br>
effect would be to &quot;forget everything you have learned&quot; or
<br>
&quot;suppress&quot; all &quot;strong&quot; feelings).  I'm not even sure that I
<br>
want to open this can of worms.
<br>
<p>I'm unsure whether the capture of bin Laden and close associates
<br>
will &quot;solve&quot; the problem (I probably doubt that will be the case).
<br>
If so, then my gut feeling is that real nanotechnology and/or the
<br>
singularity have been postponed by perhaps 5-10 years.
<br>
