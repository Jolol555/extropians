<br>
<p><em>&gt;What is &quot;supposed to be about terrorism&quot;?  
</em><br>
<p>The war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we are attempting to find solutions to terrorism then it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important to understand where it comes from and why.  If part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the why is the grievances various countries and entities have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against US policies then the question comes up as to whether any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of those grievances have merit and whether we are in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sometimes acting in oppressive manner in other countries and what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we might do to change that if so.  
</em><br>
<p>We are not looking for the solution to terrorism at the present
<br>
time, we are looking for the terrorists who committed a specific
<br>
act and their supporters. We are out to destroy them.
<br>
<p>The reasons they hate us are many, largely it seems because they
<br>
are taught lies in Pakistani maddrasas, and are broadcast bigger
<br>
lies via Al-Jazeera television.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If it makes sense to agree to an open-ended &quot;war&quot; to root out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all actual terrorists from anywhere and everywhere then surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it also makes sense to understand the roots and to work to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lessen the seeds of future terrorism where/if we can.  
</em><br>
<p>Good idea, close the maddrassas, shut down Al-Jazeera....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't see how the &quot;that alone&quot; makes any sense at all. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Especially when our government is certainly not after &quot;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alone&quot; but after finding and neutralizing all terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everywhere.  
</em><br>
<p>We are out to end this sort of thing on a permanent basis. We are
<br>
sending a clear message: &quot;being a terrorist will get you hunted
<br>
down and killed, find another way to express your frustrations.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Al-Jareeza happens to be the most independent and competent news
</em><br>
<em>&gt;source in the Mid East.  That some of its writers may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;espoused an alternate theory does not mean they are incompetent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nincompoops.  Especially when the biases in other reports from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more &quot;mainstream&quot; sources have also been quite evident.  
</em><br>
<p>Find me one piece of evidence that indicates the Israelis are
<br>
responsible for Sept 11, and I will retract my opinion about the
<br>
ridiculous Islamic tabloid known as Al-Jazeera.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In point of fact, we do not know who was behind the attack yet. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We have strong suspicion of it being bin Laden.  But I haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen anything really strong enough to convict in an open court
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yet.  
</em><br>
<p>You may not have seen anything that convinces you, but I was
<br>
convinced long ago.
<br>
<p>If I was to become a terrorist you would never find sufficient
<br>
evidence to convict me in any court.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To what end?  What are your objectives?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Destroy Bin Laden/Al-Quaeda, destroy their Taliban
<br>
supporters/allies, re-establish a viable government (democratic)
<br>
for the people of Afghanistan, get out and go home.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why is crushing Kandahar a big objective?  
</em><br>
<p>Taliban stronghold, see above.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I agree on bringing in UN peacekeepers and bringing in aid before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;winter comes on 100%.
</em><br>
<p>I'm glad we agree on this. I think the war should proceed with all
<br>
fury to shorten it to the minimal possible time to achieve the
<br>
objectives. Every day we delay, innocent people suffer.
<br>
<p>This is the reason I think we should have taken major centers like
<br>
Kabul and Mazer-el-Sharif by now, to establish within the country,
<br>
and out of Taliban control, safe zones for the people of
<br>
Afghanistan. By releasing these centers immediatly to U.N. control
<br>
we demonstrate we have no intention of staying.
<br>
<p>I think the aftermath will be disappointing. I wouldn't support a
<br>
government for Afghanistan that didn't include things like
<br>
universal suffrage, try selling that in an Islamic country.
