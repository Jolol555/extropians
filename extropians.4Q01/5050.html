<em>&gt; This compilation of definitions first appeared almost ten years ago, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had it's last real update back in 1994. It's about time we updated it!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The updated version will be linked from ExI's new FAQ, as well as providing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a useful reference linked from elsewhere on the site.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've done a quick edit, removing a few terms that never caught on and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't seem particularly useful. I *know* that there are a whole bunch of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other terms and their definitions that should be included. I haven't even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried to add the obvious ones (such as &quot;extropic art&quot;, &quot;singularitarian&quot;, etc.)
</em><br>
<p><p>I think some terms could be dropped without great loss as their use
<br>
outside the original post they were found in is unlikely. But maybe it
<br>
was found that they were funny or such, so I don't know.
<br>
<p>I suggest to drop the following for other reasons :
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; EXTRANET: The emerging communications and computation network including the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Internet as well as mobile wireless devices, telematic devices, private 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networks, and billions of embedded chips with wireless connections. [Max 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More, November 2001]
</em><br>
<p><p>This has become a common word, meaning something else (a private
<br>
network run over the Internet).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; HYPERTEXT: Massively interconnected database providing the ability to track 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information in all directions, notify you of updated information, etc. [Ted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nelson]
</em><br>
<p><p>This has become a common word, too, simply referring to text with hyperlinks.
<br>
<p><p>Jacques
