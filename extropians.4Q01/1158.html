</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ahemmm!  I think I will speak to this question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe that I am a 12th generation American citizen (those on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the list who can trump that (native Americans excepted) please
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feel free to do so).  Rafal, would I believe, be considered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;0th generation American.  Yet I find myself siding more with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rafal than with Randy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This issue has NOTHING to do with genealogy! It has to do with long term 
<br>
future of this country, and the short term future of our wallets.
<br>
<p>As for myself, I have American ancestors going back to ~ 12000 BP.
<br>
And, as someone else pointed out, West European genes have been found in 
<br>
very very old Americans, and they probably were here in America around 20000 
<br>
BP.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The &quot;Extropian Game&quot; is *NOT* &quot;horde the wealth&quot;.  The Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Game is to spin the wheel and promote complexification.
</em><br>
<p>The Extropy game is *supposed* to be about keeping our precious brain matter 
<br>
from the ravages of Entropy....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Randy's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;points are ill-suited for the Extropian list unless he makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear and falsifiable arugment that the admission of &quot;educated&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immigrants over &quot;uneducated&quot; immigrants will clearly promote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a greater rate of complexification.
</em><br>
<p><p>When you cross the street and see a bus bearing down on you, do you postpone 
<br>
running until an &quot;clear and falsifiable argument&quot; is presented that the bus 
<br>
will run you down unless you hustle your butt to the sidewalk?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sure, there are arguments that admitting half-a-billion people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with less than a high-school education is likely to reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;USA to chaos and bankrupt us.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah. And just a wee tad of common sense points you in that direction, too. 
<br>
However, there are a number of excellent studies done on the matter of 
<br>
immigration, including by the GAO.  They are on the Net, but unsurprisingly, 
<br>
they are politically incorrect, and little talked about.
<br>
<p><p>And there are arguments that
<br>
<em>&gt;excluding people like Rafal (no offence Rafal) could be beneficial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because that would presumably make physicians scarcer, driving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up their salaries that would be invested in mutual funds that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would promote capital formation in the economy.  Lord knows,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those waves of uneducated, illiterate masses would be incapable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of such sophisticated actions that promote capitalism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complexification.  Thus we end up in Randy's position that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;allowing the immigration of people like Rafal but denying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the immigration of people with very low skill levels is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desirable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NOT!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps those uneducated illiterate masses free up enough time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the educated that they are able to devote more time to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimization of their investment portfolios and that serves to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increase complexification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Maybe they defecate potpourri and piss rosewater, too. That sure could 
<br>
freshen up a room! Why don't you investigate? :-)
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;(No slights intended -- from each according to his or her means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each according to his or hero skills and desires).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do we measure ourselves by how much we have or by how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we have contributed?!?  This is a fine line in the Extropian Game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;First there is nobody citing peer-reviewed economic studies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that in any way justify their positions.
</em><br>
<p>Borjas, the Harvard economist--there ya go.
<br>
<p><p><p>You are contributing
<br>
<em>&gt;to the *NOISE* and not to the *DATA*!  I'm in the Anders camp
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here -- YOUR OPINIONS COUNT FOR LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you can link them back to scientific data -- *THAT* is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropianism is all about.  (I'm willing to listen to speculative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypothesis but the Subject line (ARE YOU LISTENING PEOPLE?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should read:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    SPECULATIVE HYPOTHESIS: US should only allow educated immigation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DATA (good) EVIDENCE (good) OPINION (bad)!  (unless you can back it up)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Randy -- I *challenge* you -- how do you KNOW *they* are witches?
</em><br>
<p><p>Sometimes the problem is so complex that obtaining complete information is 
<br>
impractical. IN that case, no action is the best path. No action == no 
<br>
immigration. But however, there is evidence---against immigration.  Just 
<br>
search the Net, the studies are out there....So then you may say that there 
<br>
are studies FOR immigration. I am sure there are. And I know that there is 
<br>
plenty of money to finance such studies.  So you have some for and some 
<br>
against. And...the American are generally against current levels of 
<br>
immigration. Hey, that might be a tiny factor, too...
