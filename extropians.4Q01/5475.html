</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure why.  IMO, ExI exists to encourage rational discussion,
<br>
not to adopt positions.  Rational discussion seems to suggest one
<br>
takes a position so long as it is useful from some perspective.
<br>
Adopting &quot;labels&quot; that represent positions makes it more difficult
<br>
to change those positions when they are no longer useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Re: degree of interconnectedness and &quot;personal responsibility&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non sequitir...
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I wasn't clear -- If I value my &quot;family&quot; members more than
<br>
I value the average citizen of the 3rd world (i.e. I'm strongly
<br>
interconnected and view my responsibility to them as very high),
<br>
then I'm likely to be against immigration (if immigration threatens
<br>
my income or their income) -- I may even be against globalization
<br>
and believe in protectionist trade policies.  If on the other hand
<br>
I view myself as a &quot;citizen of the world&quot; and view my &quot;personal
<br>
responsibility&quot; to be largely to humanity and not any specific
<br>
individuals, then I'm likely to feel that anyone should be allowed
<br>
to immigrate anywhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; computronium...how is this relevant?
</em><br>
<p>In the future there will be hard limits on how much computronium
<br>
one can have.  Now there are limits on how much capital, air, water,
<br>
oil, etc. one can have.  It was perhaps a poor metaphor if one
<br>
is unfamiliar with previous discussions on the topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Re: &quot;Which is better -- natural selection or fairness?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have once again wandered in a fantasyland of extropian jargona and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctrine....massive non sequitir....
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm... I personally find &quot;Perpetual Progress&quot; and &quot;Self-Transformation&quot;
<br>
two of the more important aspects of &quot;Extropian Principles&quot;.  IMO,
<br>
one cannot have perpetual progress without natural selection.
<br>
At the same time without some &quot;fairness&quot; a lot of people will
<br>
never have the opportunity to self-transform.  To me there
<br>
seems to be an inherent tension between those two principles.
<br>
<p>(I assume that the FAQ should be attempting to answer questions
<br>
that may in part arise from the Principles).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;In spite of the fact that most Americans are descended from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;people who took advantage of relatively open borders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is this relevant?  At what point does this twisted logic end? When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are 6 billion people here? 
</em><br>
<p>Or perhaps even more.  My father's ancestors had the opportunity
<br>
to be some of the first people to colonize the U.S.  My mother's
<br>
ancestors got to flee Ireland during the potato famines.  It
<br>
seems unethical (to me) to deny to others the opportunities
<br>
that my ancestors had.
<br>
<p>A quick glance at the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot;
<br>
(<a href="http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html">http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html</a>) suggests that a
<br>
restrictive immigration policy violates numerous articles.
<br>
<p>e.g. Article 15.
<br>
<em>&gt; (1) Everyone has the right to a nationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     denied the right to change his nationality.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;In part this is natural human xenophobia and in part this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's good...I always respond to labels like &quot;xenophobe&quot; and &quot;commie,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commie&quot;....
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that I suggested those were &quot;labels&quot;.  Humans
<br>
(and any &quot;sophisticated&quot; species) *naturally* fears the unknown.
<br>
Those that don't do not survive for long, thus &quot;xenophobia&quot; is
<br>
a natural trait.
<br>
<p>I was using the &quot;communist&quot; system as one which tried to create
<br>
inherent &quot;equality&quot; for all of its citizens (as perhaps does the
<br>
Universal Declaration of Human Rights tries to do for all humans).
<br>
Unfortunately the communist approach by most accounts was
<br>
not successful.  (Presumably economies are most productive
<br>
by allowing the smartest to excel and reap the benefits
<br>
and not utilize resources to support otherwise unproductive
<br>
members of society -- i.e. the most productive economies
<br>
are those that allow the greatest amount of natural selection).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The immigration system ALWAYS benefited those who own and hurt those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who work...
</em><br>
<p>Facts not in evidence.  My ancestors were farmers and fishermen.
<br>
They had to clear the land, plow the fields, build the boats, etc.
<br>
To the degree they worked they were the ones who benefited.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People who tresspass into the USA in the name of stealing benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizenship are criminals and should be prosecuted as such.
</em><br>
<p>Non-citizens coming to the USA don't have the benefits of citizenship
<br>
other than to the extent citizens and their elected representatives
<br>
have chosen to grant them some of those rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That should deter illegal immigration.  The will of the American public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (60% want less immigration) should be enforced.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't solve the problem.  The American public still wants
<br>
cheap sneakers and computers -- that is why the sneaker and computer
<br>
chip factories are now being built in China.  The only reason I
<br>
can see Americans being opposed to more immigration is to protect
<br>
their jobs or salaries.  The jobs and salaries are leaving anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe1.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe1.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Interesting.  I find some flaws.  I don't think the U.S. can
<br>
be considered the &quot;welfare-state&quot; it once was.  I do think the
<br>
current immigration policies more closely mimic the policies
<br>
of a monarchy rather than a democracy.  Those who have wealth
<br>
or certain educations or desirable skills have a much easier
<br>
time getting into the U.S. than those who don't.
