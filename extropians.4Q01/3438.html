<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry, Mike, but when trials are closed, it's too easy to accuse

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, public trials for all offenses, provided the accused agrees to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surrender for trial with no caveats. If someone refuses to be captured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and remains a threat, how far should others risk their lives just so

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That was not the issue here.  The issue was whether military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribunals are appropriate.
</em><br>
<p>So? You are assuming that they will not be made public, to start with.
<br>
Furthermore, public trials are actually NOT the right of every person.
<br>
You have a right to a trial by a jury of your peers. There is nothing in
<br>
the constitution that says that the trial has to be public as it occurs.
<br>
Indeed, it is often the prerogative of judges to seal a trial to
<br>
whatever extent they feel necessary. Trials must be a matter of public
<br>
record, i.e. their proceedings must be made public at some time after
<br>
they occur, but, for instance, jury deliberations are not a matter of
<br>
public record, nor are many settlements and plea bargains.
<br>
<p>Given the circumstances, sealing trials of terrorists until the conflict
<br>
is concluded, or for simply some time after trial to greatly reduce the
<br>
intelligence value of those public records, is a rational measure to
<br>
take. It is a bit extreme, but we are not dealing with citizens here,
<br>
nor are we dealing with anyone who would in any rational way accept OUR
<br>
posession of similar civil rights.
<br>
<p>Human/civil rights only exist de facto when all participating parties
<br>
agree they do, regardless of their de theorem basis. If a murderer
<br>
doesn't think you have a right to live, then he similarly loses his
<br>
right to live. This is the basis of self defense. Similarly, the Taliban
<br>
and al Qaeda organizations have denied that human beings posess any
<br>
human rights outside the Sharia Law. Hold them to their own standard.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; There are certainly some aspects of the American judicial system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that can be changed: jury selection, rules of evidence, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; procedural details.  But openness isn't one of them: if anything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; American trials should be _more_ open: ALL of them, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; those for suspected foreign terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, so you think that jury members identities should be public knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for terrorism trials? How naive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not in the least.  The identities are just as public or not at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the court's discrestion as in trials of say, Mafia bosses.
</em><br>
<p>That is so obviously the problem. Yet the problem with Lee's argument
<br>
now is that he is insisting  that our trial system be inviolate, in that
<br>
the principle of public trials be held sacrosanct, but he is perfectly
<br>
willing to violate his own premise in changing jury selection rules,
<br>
rules of evidence, and procedural details just so his concept will work.
<br>
One more example of &quot;stealing the assumption&quot;.
