<p><p>Essentially all line troops now receive substantial urban warfare training,

Corps and all the various types of Infantry divisions in the Army (Light,

Mechanized, Airborne).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a soldiering standpoint, urban warfare training (MOUT training, in

military parlance) rates high on the fun factor scale (mostly because it is
<br>
hardcore and mission-oriented infantry stuff -- &quot;boys and their toys&quot;), and
<br>
the enthusiasm breeds competence.  If it was universally despised training
<br>
(like NBC training), the skills of the average soldier would be more
<br>
questionable.  Having done substantial MOUT training myself (in structurally
<br>
realistic miniature cities), I can say that it is some of the most enjoyable
<br>
training the line soldiers have to do.  It also builds good instincts for
<br>
the dynamics of urban street warfare; many of the core heuristics for urban
<br>
warfare run counter to most people's assumptions, and realistic training
<br>
serves to shatter these illusions and reinforce (and develop) methods that
<br>
work.
