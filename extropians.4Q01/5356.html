<p>There's another type of entity we ought to consider in the context
<br>
of a singularity: the limited liability company.
<br>
<p>A company is a legal entity that can own property and obey
<br>
instructions. It can also issue instructions to other companies that it
<br>
has shares in, in accordance with a set of pre-wired programming (its
<br>
charter). I know of companies that are wholly owned by other companies in
<br>
a cyclic graph structure; a friend of mine runs an off-the-shelf company
<br>
factory and his robot companies act as secretary and treasurer for the
<br>
new nestlings until it's time to sell them to their new owners.
<br>
<p>Currently this is all paper-and-pen work, but is there any legal
<br>
reason why you couldn't, for example, embed a formal grammar in a
<br>
company constitution along with an injunction to execute instructions
<br>
received from authorised directors in the form of source code? If/when
<br>
the company administration mechanisms move to network-mediated exchanges
<br>
(probably using EDIFACT documents embedded in XML to exchange paperwork)
<br>
this all becomes somewhat plausible ...
<br>
<p>Adds a whole new meaning to the term &quot;shell company&quot;, doesn't it?
<br>
<p>I think we're actually seeing a rather odd expansion in the scope of,
<br>
and use of, limited companies. I mean, until 1947 here in the UK it
<br>
took an Act of Parliament to establish a company. Today, it costs about
<br>
twenty pounds and requires filling out a couple of forms. A startling
<br>
proportion of the people I know own companies. The &quot;let's buy a shell
<br>
company, just in case it comes in handy&quot; meme seems to have been spreading
<br>
on the back of the &quot;let's register a domain&quot; meme, and lots of people who'd
<br>
never have looked at the concept before are jumping on board.
<br>
<p>(Wouldn't it make sense -- from a rights point of view, at least until the
<br>
law catches up with reality -- to implement any conscious AI as software
<br>
running on and owned by a limited-liability company, just to protect it
<br>
from the risk of some irresponsible Joy-like person switching the power
<br>
off and saying &quot;it was just a program, what's all the fuss about&quot;?)
<br>
<p>And if the first human-equivalent AIs show up already equipped with the 
<br>
same legal rights as a company, what does this imply?
<br>
<p>(Personally, I'm not sure I want to be sharing the planet with Redmond
<br>
when Microsoft, Inc.  wakes up and starts taking a hard look around.)
