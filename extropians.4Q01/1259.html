<em>&gt; WHat role could XML play in this?
</em><br>
<p>Probably an extensive role. &lt;g&gt;
<br>
<p>On 29 October, Tatsuya Hagino gives a talk on the Current Situation and
<br>
Perspective of Semantic Web and XML at the INTAP Semantic Web Conference in
<br>
Tokyo, Japan. (News archive)

<p>Semantic Web on XML
<br>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/Talks/1206-xml2k-tbl/slide1-0.html">http://www.w3.org/2000/Talks/1206-xml2k-tbl/slide1-0.html</a>

You probably have a lot of people using XML by now. You should have someone
<br>
looking at the next level - RDF. Tell them not to worry about the syntax, but
<br>
check out the model. This is a question of looking the data your company is
<br>
storing and transferring, and making sure that it can be represented in that
<br>
simple circles-and-arrows RDF way. This is very simple. An important trick is
<br>
that you use URIs to identify the arrows as well as the circles. Doing this
<br>
homework will ensure that you have a well-defined data model, which will allow
<br>
you data to be combined, merged with any other RDF-model data. It will mean
<br>
you will be able to multiply the power of separate application areas by
<br>
running RDF queries and new RDF-based applications across both areas. It will
<br>
mean that you will be there with talent which understands the basic model as
<br>
the Semantic Web becomes all-important.
<br>
Other things to watch: SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics - at last, graphics
<br>
which can be rendered optimally on all sizes of device. The user interface
<br>
world is rapdly becoming comptent at voice input and output an W3C has
<br>
standards in that area coming along. XML Signature will let you to digitally
<br>
sign XML documents - find out how. But in general, always check out the W3C
<br>
home page for what's new.
<br>
<p>XML and Semantics
<br>
<a href="http://www.semanticweb.org/knowmarkup.html#semantics">http://www.semanticweb.org/knowmarkup.html#semantics</a>
<br>
The eXtended Markup Language is accepted as THE emerging standard for data
<br>
interchange on the Web. XML allows authors to create their own markup (e.g.
<br>
&lt;AUTHOR&gt;), which seems to carry some semantics. However, from a computational
<br>
perspective tags like &lt;AUTHOR&gt; carries as much semantics as a tag like &lt;H1&gt;. A
<br>
computer simply does not know, what an author is and how the concept author is
<br>
related to e.g. a concept person. XML may help humans predict what information
<br>
might lie &quot;between the tags&quot; in the case of &lt;trunk&gt;&lt;/trunk&gt;, but XML can only
<br>
help. For an XML processor, &lt;trunk&gt; and &lt;i&gt; and &lt;bookTitle&gt; are all equally
<br>
(and totally) meaningless. Yes, meaningless.
<br>
This has direct consequences for economy on the web.

<p>The XML Cover Pages
<br>
XML and 'The Semantic Web'
<br>
By: Robin Cover
<br>
<a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/xmlAndSemanticWeb.html">http://xml.coverpages.org/xmlAndSemanticWeb.html</a>
<br>
Two important technologies for developing the Semantic Web are already in
<br>
place: eXtensible Markup Language (XML) and the Resource Description Framework
<br>
(RDF). XML lets everyone create their own tags -- hidden labels such as or
<br>
that annotate Web pages or sections of text on a page. Scripts, or programs,
<br>
can make use of these tags in sophisticated ways, but the script writer has to
<br>
know what the page writer uses each tag for. In short, XML allows users to add
<br>
arbitrary structure to their documents but says nothing about what the
<br>
structures mean . Meaning is expressed by RDF, which encodes it in sets of
<br>
triples, each triple being rather like the subject, verb and object of an
<br>
elementary sentence. These triples can be written using XML tags. In RDF, a
<br>
document makes assertions that particular things (people, Web pages or
<br>
whatever) have properties (such as 'is a sister of,' 'is the author of') with
<br>
certain values (another person, another Web page). This structure turns out to
<br>
be a natural way to describe the vast majority of the data processed by
<br>
machines. Subject and object are each identified by a Universal Resource
<br>
Identifier (URI), just as used in a link on a Web page. (URLs, Uniform
<br>
Resource Locators, are the most common type of URI.) The verbs are also
<br>
identified by URIs, which enables anyone to define a new concept, a new verb,
<br>
just by defining a URI for it somewhere on the Web... this is not the end of
<br>
the story, because two databases may use different identifiers for what is in
<br>
fact the same concept, such as zip code. A program that wants to compare or
<br>
combine information across the two databases has to know that these two terms
<br>
are being used to mean the same thing. Ideally, the program must have a way to
<br>
discover such common meanings for whatever databases it encounters. A solution
<br>
to this problem is provided by the third basic component of the Semantic Web,
<br>
collections of information called ontologies.
<br>
<p>XML and the Second-Generation Web
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciam.com/1999/0599issue/0599bosak.html">http://www.sciam.com/1999/0599issue/0599bosak.html</a>
<br>
As XML spreads, the Web should become noticeably more responsive. At present,
<br>
computing devices connected to the Web, whether they are powerful desktop
<br>
computers or tiny pocket planners, cannot do much more than get a form, fill
<br>
it out and then swap it back and forth with a Web server until a job is
<br>
completed. But the structural and semantic information that can be added with
<br>
XML allows these devices to do a great deal of processing on the spot. That
<br>
not only will take a big load off Web servers but also should reduce network
<br>
traffic dramatically.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
