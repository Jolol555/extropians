<p>Michael - Do you believe that computer programs can be conscious?
<br>
This is not clear from your message.
<br>
<p>If you do, then imagine that you find yourself one day to be a computer
<br>
program.  Ignore the question of whether you are the same person as some
<br>
human precursor, just consider the future.  If the computer is stopped
<br>
and re-started, are you the same person?  If your program is copied to
<br>
another section of memory, are you the same person?  If two copies of
<br>
your program are made, are they both you?
<br>
<p>I think considering the questions in this way is helpful as it lets us
<br>
get past some of our intuitions and prejudices from our evolutionary past
<br>
where one body == one mind.  We can think more clearly and analytically
<br>
about the problems by considering disembodied consciousness.  That lets
<br>
us focus on the role of information and its transfer.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------------
<br>
<p>Thats a good question, short Answer I would think, yes, they could be and
<br>
will be someday considered conciouss beings.  
<br>
<p>If the computer was stopped and restarted completely?  I would think it
<br>
would still be the same 'person' primarily because only its transient state
<br>
had changed, not its form or the material that makes up the pattern.  If the
<br>
program was copied from once segment of memory to another, since this would
<br>
be analogous to a destructive copying of a human neural pattern, I would say
<br>
that it was now a copy with the original destroyed.  I would say this
<br>
because you could 'copy it' without 'deleting' the original, and they would
<br>
then both be conciouss entities that do not share subjective experiences,
<br>
similiar to the thought experiement of copying a human mind without
<br>
destroying the original that I outlined in my post.  If two copies are made
<br>
and the original destroyed (deleted) you simpy have two new beings, but the
<br>
original had no subjective continuity of experience.
<br>
<p>With computer intelligence the copying/destruction could happen so rapidly
<br>
that it is hard to consider as relevant, but just because it happens quick
<br>
or often doesnt make the question any less important or valid.
<br>
