<em>&gt; &gt; What good is having shared goals if your beliefs and actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually prevent us from getting there?  There is certainly room
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for those who choose to believe irrational things personally but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who generally stay out of the way of those who are building the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future; but irrational people do have a tendency to spread their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irrationality or use it to interfere.  That they are well-meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is no excuse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What good are put-downs of those with active spirituality if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they tend to turn away highly talented people dedicated to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating the future you desire?  What you call irrational I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might call (in some cases) supra-rational.  I believe that many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supra-rational viewpoints and concerns are actually critical to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building a future that is viable personally.   Meaning well is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no excuse for anyone.
</em><br>
<p>We don't actually disagree here much; I do see a place for some
<br>
of what I would call spirituality, especially with regard to
<br>
ethics and esthetics.  Even a mathematician can benefit from
<br>
following lines of reason that seem &quot;elegant&quot;.  I studied Zen
<br>
and still practice zazen regularly.  But your initial question
<br>
suggests that you see contemporary mainstream
<br>
non-fundamentalist religions as this kind of benign, even
<br>
beneficial, spiritualism; while I see most of them as over the
<br>
edge.  Even something as seemingly benign as Christianity is
<br>
not merely extra-rational or supra-rational, it is decidedly
<br>
anti-rational, and that's not acceptable.  Spirituality has a
<br>
place _beside_ rational thought; but those who actively oppose
<br>
the latter, even when they don't realize it, are a danger to
<br>
the future.
