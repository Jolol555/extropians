<p><em>&gt;I find it interesting that he views the immune system as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inherently xenophobic. I know he bases this on how the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immune system works (anything not belonging to the self must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destroyed or expelled), but to me the immune system conjures up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the concept of something distributed, pervasive and adaptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than xenophobic. One can protect a society without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;xenophobic, and the ideal way of dealing with small groups of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enemies is to be good at detecting them on the individual level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than look at overbroad classes. 
</em><br>
<p>Indeed this is a mischaracterization of the immune system.
<br>
<p>Our bodies are swarming with non-us entities, from individual cells
<br>
to the mites that inhabit every hair/skin pore on our bodies.
<br>
<p>What the immiune system does is try to recognize things dangerous
<br>
to the body, it tolerates a wide variety of non-dangerous others.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Transparency is a first order such system: there are sensors for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mischief everywhere. In order to retain an open society these have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be aimed not just as potential terrorists but at everybody,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially the powers that be. It is no coincidence that David
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brin talked about the immune system of democracy when he discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the people keeping checks on the powerful (for good and bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasons); what could be needed is to extend this system into an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overall system of mischief detection, both external, internal and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;autoimmune. 
</em><br>
<p>While valuable, transparency isn't essential. What is essential is
<br>
the the immune systems elements can detect characteristics of the
<br>
intruder. Sometimes the systems fails at this and attacks non-
<br>
threatening elements in which case the immune system itself
<br>
performs the damage. As anyone who has suffered an auto-immune
<br>
disease can tell you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course, that won't stop people from communicating by strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crypto. But it is not the evil thoughts that matter, it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evil deeds. If everything done in cyberspace remains secret but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything done in the real world can be monitored, we still have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a pretty good defense. 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, but of course everything in cyberspace is not secret, in
<br>
fact most is transparent.
<br>
<p>People in this country have a history of trading freedom for
<br>
convenience/security for example. I could easily see the emergence
<br>
from this for say an &quot;Air Travel I.D. card&quot;
<br>
<p>For being willing to submit to say a background check and
<br>
fingerprinting one could obtain this I.D. which would allow one to
<br>
bypass long security procedures at airports. A simple Instacheck at
<br>
the airport would confirm your &quot;currently ok&quot; status.
<br>
<p>For those who find this outrageous, this is exactly what every gun
<br>
owner goes through everyday (although currently minus the
<br>
fingerprinting).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I found it ironic that the US has asked Quatar to rein in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arabic satelite channel based there, on the grounds that it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supply information to Afghanistan. I sincerely hope they do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bend to that pressure. That satelite channel has caused the ire of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most governmentsin the area, since it actually sends its own news
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that doesn't follow any party line (except not criticizing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government of Quatar - that was part of the deal they made;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything else is fair game) and does some serious journalism on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its own (it has correspondents in Afghanistan right now and has in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the past uncovered quite a few embarrasing truths elsewhere in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arab world). So far Quatar has not done anything, and I hope they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be even less persuaded by the US than Saudi Arabia. 
</em><br>
<p>The military is not a democratic entity, so it is a normal function
<br>
of the military to try and supress information channels that are
<br>
against it's best interests.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The point is, all the other mass media in the region are state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;controlled. You can figure out what that means. Open societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need free media, and the US seems to be making a grave mistake if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they try to limit the only existing free media in the region. 
</em><br>
<p>As I said the U.S. is in &quot;military mode&quot; at the moment.
<br>
<p>Does freedom of information mean freedom of instantaneous
<br>
information?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Lanier is a critic of transhumanism, but in many ways a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;critic. He points out weak points in our program or in how it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presented (which is just as important), and it is up to us to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him that he is wrong or adjust our actions to make him wrong. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is on the enlightenment side like us, unlike Leon Kass and Jeremy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rifkin, and he appreciates the benefits of technology and freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;far more than Bill Joy. 
</em><br>
<p>Any references to comments by Lanier on Transhumanism or
<br>
Extropianism?
