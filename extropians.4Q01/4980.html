<p><em>&gt;I have to confess, some of the discussion on Extropians these days is

<em>&gt;making me feel sick to my stomach. It is enough to make me seriously

<em>&gt;consider leaving, possibly for good, or until someone else informs me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the list has made a recovery. If Extropy and ExI takes a serious hit from
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;forums.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;[snip]
</em><br>
<p>I am snipping most of Eliezer's post for the sake of brevity, but I have a 
<br>
few comments I would like to make.  First of all, Eliezer is correct that 
<br>
this list is a privately-run public forum.  Anyone who looks at the 
<br>
archives can make any determination of the content he or she 
<br>
wants.  However, that is true of *all* written content currently on the 
<br>
internet (and elsewhere).  There are ways to prevent the public from 
<br>
perceiving transhumanism in a negative way, but anyone who has a will to 
<br>
slander the philosophy of Extropy can freely do it.  It has been done, and 
<br>
will continue to be done, regardless of what is said on this mailing 
<br>
list.  The same can be said for Singularitarianism and any other movement 
<br>
or sub-movement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There are no &quot;Indians&quot;. There are no &quot;Afghani&quot;. There are only humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transhumanism, and Singularitarianism, are basically egalitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophies, because they permit the analysis of cosmic perspectives, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when you look through a cosmic perspective the modern-day divisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between humans become absurd.
</em><br>
<p>While there is truth to that, I would also like to say that the world 
<br>
*right now* doesn't have the same lack of racial distinction that is 
<br>
proffered above.  While it is rather idyllic to look upon humanity as being 
<br>
one race, that is a view that is shared by few.  To ignore this fact as we 
<br>
march ahead into the future is, in my view, self defeating.  We have to be 
<br>
aware to the landscape we are in right now to have any kind of success with 
<br>
our views.  This means that not only should we ignore it and uphold the 
<br>
ideal ourselves, we should bring *more* light to the issue...rationally
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, that's what it's really about. I think it'd be nice if everyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agrees with this reasoning posts a &quot;Me too!&quot;, and everyone who disagrees
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the argument but agrees with the conclusion posts a note saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as well. The people who are new to the list need to see something to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outweigh some of the poisonous remarks that seem to be getting so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;airtime.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I am wrong, but I haven't seen any remarks as poisonous as Eliezer 
<br>
claims.  I *am* aware that there have been remarks verging on ad hominem, 
<br>
and I have taken steps to prevent that, but if someone posts a constructive 
<br>
argument for or against something, then I'm all for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Of course I fear that most of the good guys in this battle may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have already gotten sick of the list and unsubscribed, so it may be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;late. But for the record, I want to say that there was a time when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would never have needed to post this message, and *that* is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism is *really* about, no matter what happens to this mailing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list.
</em><br>
<p>For the record, from my side of things I don't see that the issue is as 
<br>
detrimental as Eliezer's post paints it to be.
