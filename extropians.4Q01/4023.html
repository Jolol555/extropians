</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are these edge cases?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not a scientist, and have no way of proving this through
<br>
empirical evidence or anything else, but just looking at the
<br>
second law of thermodynamics makes me wonder if it's possible
<br>
for work to be done without a measurable change from potential
<br>
to kinetic energy.
<br>
<p>By definition, it's impossible -- potential energy becomes
<br>
kinetic energy when work is done.  It's how we measure these
<br>
things.  However, at a fundamental level, since energy cannot
<br>
be created or destroyed (according to the first law), could
<br>
what we'd classify as &quot;potential energy&quot; act on another entity
<br>
without that potential energy becoming kinetic energy?
<br>
<p>At a macroscopic level, I'm thinking of gravitational force.
<br>
Even if an object isn't moving (it exerts a normal force
<br>
against another object) it still experiences gravitational
<br>
force.  There's no movement because forces cancel out, but
<br>
even with all the energy in the system existing as &quot;potential
<br>
energy&quot; ... that gravitational force is still being exerted.
<br>
<p>There are similar forces at the microscopic level, but then
<br>
you'd observe that objects really are &quot;moving&quot; even if it
<br>
means they're just vibrating in place rapidly.  So, there's
<br>
always work being done, even if we can't measure it.  In a
<br>
way, at that level, there IS no such thing as actual potential
<br>
energy.  Even in a system of low entropy, there's still an
<br>
immeasurably large amount of disorder even if we can't measure
<br>
or observe it (yes, this is handwaving and a big guess, but
<br>
it seems logical to me).
<br>
<p>So, my question is:  why wouldn't it be conceivable to
<br>
exploit this?  Build a system that at the macroscopic level
<br>
appears to be doing work but potential and kinetic energy
<br>
is fixed, while at the microscopic level is where all the
<br>
real work and activity take place.
<br>
<p>Yes, this starts to sound a lot like the &quot;perpetual motion&quot;
<br>
pipe-dream, I know.  Perpetual motion _may_ be a pipe-dream,
<br>
but I don't think the concept is.
<br>
<p>Maybe, someday, I'll learn enough about this stuff to be
<br>
given the opportunity be a scientist, and experiment, and
<br>
mabybe I'll have real proof to back up my handwaving and
<br>
wild assertions.
<br>
<p>Sorry to disappoint you,
<br>
