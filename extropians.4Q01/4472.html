<p>i think more computers are attacked because there is more lousy 
<br>
software, and less educated hackers is employed. 
<br>
<p>this is natural consequence of migration of amphetamine-driven 
<br>
intelectuals to countries where drugs are legal.
<br>
<p>we have same problem in poland, with simple script my younger 
<br>
brother breaked into goverement Social Insurance company 
<br>
(called ZUS), which provided very big hole... also in users 
<br>
(forcing to use insecure m$oftware). if he would delete 
<br>
anything, there would be mess for MONTHS for them not 
<br>
mentioning that they'll have to confess that their software is 
<br>
lousy, so he didn't it just because he is polite (and providing 
<br>
'backdoor' to himself and other people - maybe someone will 
<br>
think out how to not make mess, but earn money?)
<br>
<p>in times when drugs were semi-legal (this means not-illegal, 
<br>
but not traded on open market, just shared)
<br>
there were much more hackers, crackers, coders, etc. than now 
<br>
(now they sometime give access to their severs or send acid 
<br>
from amsterdam with 'greetings from free land')
<br>
in times of mighty alcohol and chaotic caffeine no serious 
<br>
coding can be done (not to mention de-legalisation means social 
<br>
isolation, which is very important for brainstorms)
