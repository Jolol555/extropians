<p><em>&gt; Medicine *now* extends the human life span. In those places which do

</em><br>
<p>Correct, life span in developed countries almost doubled in the
<br>
last century.  Though I think there may be some question as
<br>
to the sources of that.  In particular, I think Robin Hanson
<br>
has done some analysis that suggested you couldn't tie the
<br>
extension directly to improved health care.  I'm not sure if
<br>
it is written up however.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2) When do you expect the techniques for near-immortality to arrive?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; From what I have read, it seems like this will come from nanotechnology's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mature stages.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, nanomedicine is the best bet for significant life extension and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-aging treatments.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  I think we can get many of the benefits nanotechnology
<br>
promises with advanced biotechnology.
<br>
<p>Some things I'm expecting this decade:
<br>
a) Tying most major diseases to their genetic polymorphisms (or gene
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;combinations) that cause them.
<br>
b) Relatively inexpensive gene chip tests to allow you to be aware of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your polymorphism risk profile and take preventive measures.
<br>
c) Rationally designed drugs, radioimmunotherapy, angiogenesis and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;telomerase inhibitors to take a big stick to cancer.
<br>
d) Some of the first real anti-aging drugs -- Alteon's Alt-411
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being the first example, and Simon Melov's antioxidant enzyme
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mimics (also being worked on by Oxis, MetaPhore Pharmaceutical,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Centaur Pharmaceuticals, etc.)
<br>
e) A reasonable chance for growing replacment organs from your own
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stem cells. 
<br>
f) The development of more robust gene therapy methods that allow you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to patch genomes with at first a few and eventually hundreds of genes.
<br>
<p>Those should buy you a pretty big increase -- perhaps 10-50 years.
<br>
If we ultimately figure out what &quot;aging&quot; is (f) might allow us to
<br>
significantly slow it down.
<br>
<p>So I don't think we are going to require robust molecular nanotechnology
<br>
(of the type required to construct nanorobots) to make significant
<br>
progress on aging.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A book by that title has recently been published, [snip]
</em><br>
<p>See: <a href="http://www.nanomedicine.com/">http://www.nanomedicine.com/</a>
<br>
and: <a href="http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/">http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/</a>
<br>
<p>The real advantage of nanorobot based nanomedicine is that it
<br>
will allow you to develop much better diagnostic methods
<br>
(detecting cancers very early), allow you to work around
<br>
mis-programming of our geneitc program (e.g. the septic shock
<br>
resulting from an  overreaction of the immune system during 
<br>
bacteremia [bacteria in the blood]), and develop systems that
<br>
would augment the body sufficiently that you can survive
<br>
what otherwise would be unsurvivable events (e.g. respirocytes
<br>
that would allow you to survive heart failures of 15-30 minutes).
