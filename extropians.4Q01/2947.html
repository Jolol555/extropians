<em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Ad%20hominem?%20I%20think%20not.&In-Reply-To=&lt;200111211555.HAA11665@well.com&gt;">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;1)  The US intervention in Afghanistan is doing more harm than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From the Taliban perspective undoubtably.
</em><br>
<p>The happy faces in the streets of Afghan cities suggest otherwise.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;2)  A superior strategy for the US would have been to turn the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other cheek, thus gaining moral superiority and showing the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we don't always bomb people we don't like.
</em><br>
<p>Unsupportable. In fact historical evidence suggests that these same
<br>
people would interpret such action as weakness.
<br>
<p>We are not doing anything that was not done to us first, and we
<br>
will take any actions necessary to prevent another atrocity from
<br>
being committed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;3)  The number of dead Afghan civilians has vastly exceeded the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number of dead American civilians, and this puts the US in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong.
</em><br>
<p>War doesn't work this way. We have done everything possible to
<br>
avoid civilian casualties, no nation in the history of the world
<br>
has done more.
<br>
<p>I believe a realistic determination of civilian casualties will be
<br>
quite small.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;4)  What happened to the US was directly caused by the US carrying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out an inconsistent and immoral strategy in foreign relations over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the past fifty years.
</em><br>
<p>What happened to the U.S. was pre-meditated murder committed by
<br>
religious fanatics.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;5)  The US is currently in the grip of a fever of destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hatred and this hatred is both morally wrong and strategically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;counterproductive, regardless of all other moral issues involved.
</em><br>
<p><p>Our actions as a result of the atrocity have been the most
<br>
reasonable in all of history.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;6)  Bin Laden may not have had just cause to blow up the World
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Trade Center, but a lot of Middle East citizens have reason to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty annoyed at the US - perhaps more reason to be annoyed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US than the US has reason to be annoyed at Bin Laden.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>The premeditated murder of thousands of American civilians has no
<br>
equal to anything the U.S. has engaged in.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;7)  It would be wrong to impose US culture on Afghanistan as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;retaliation for the World Trade Center Attack.  (I do *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe this; see below.)
</em><br>
<p><p>We are not out to impose U.S. culture on Afghanistan. We may be
<br>
part of enforcing world standards.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;8)  Technology, science, and the Internet are mere artifacts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Western culture which don't belong to the ancient Afghan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;traditions - rather than being the products of intelligence itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and therefore the universal heritage of every human on the planet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regardless of what the Taliban believes about the &quot;Westernness&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology, as the result of temporary differentials in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technological advancement that happen to be correlated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with different cultures.  (I believe the latter.)
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this and the rest of your points.
