<p>Oops, gonna be a long one.
<br>
<p>Executive summary: corporations and governments (I'll charitably call
<br>
them collective intelligences, or CIs) are a model system for how
<br>
humans can coexist with AI. Want to make AI friendly? Come up with
<br>
a way to make CIs friendly, and you'll have something resembling a
<br>
game plan.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have no basis for belief that such efforts can affect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;morality&quot; of the SI, because the SI is not analyzable by humans.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-singularity self-destruction on any given day. Thus, we should try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to minimize the number of pre-singularity days.
</em><br>
<p>In fact, we already have evidence that superhuman entitites will not
<br>
be friendly. Governments, mega-corporations, and [other] terrorist
<br>
groups demonstrate that collective intelligences (CIs from now on) are
<br>
capable of being....
<br>
<p>1) More powerful than the sum of their parts.
<br>
2) Amoral and utterly indifferent to the welfare of individuals and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;groups unless market forces and/or legislation rub their noses in it.
<br>
3) Short sighted, even to their own detriment (CIA propping up fascist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regimes thus getting us in the mess we're in today; IMF/World Bank
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing the job on aforementioned places from the economic angle).
<br>
4) At the emotional maturity level of toddlers (witness US's reaction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the Chinese shot down our spy plane; the pettiness of both
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sides in the ad nauseum Israel/Palestine escapades; Napster
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corporation filing a trademark infringement suit against The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offspring even while Napster was up to its nosehairs in litigation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the RIAA over copyright infringement)
<br>
<p>It ain't looking good, folks. Of course, Eliezer would argue that it's
<br>
because CIs were designed by humans and inherited our evolutionary,
<br>
atavistic, aggressive tendencies. To which I'll reply that...
<br>
<p>1) The social graces that allow us to refrain from beating up people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who cut in front of us in line or step on our feet have emerged from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolutionary forces, specifically iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
<br>
2) It appears that social graces are too complex a behavior to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completely instinctual, and we need childhood and adolescence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to fully develop these faculties. Babysitting an adolescent AI that's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smarter than you are will be... challenging.
<br>
3) I've met Eliezer and he seems human and shaped by evolutionary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pressures, at least insofar as anybody on this list is. I wish
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him the best in not transferring his human failings onto his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brainchild. He's a brilliant guy, so he and his collaborators
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just might do it, but I'll remain optimally paranoid for now.

</em><br>
<p>Cool. Power to you. I'm working on getting all of y'all to age slower
<br>
