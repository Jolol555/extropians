</em><br>
<p>IOW, democracy is OK insofar as it isn't entirely a democracy, but also a 
<br>
consensus-ocracy.  I don't think this is at odds with the authors claim that
<br>
democracy often does bad things and something else has to restrain it.
<br>
Anyway, consensus is not at all the restraint in the US; it's the judiciary.
<br>
Although the constitution gets little change, the judiciary will put in wild
<br>
interpretations to get what they want through.  My fave recent examples
<br>
are 1) calling the Washington state grandparent visitation laws 
<br>
unconstitutional
<br>
2) saying states aren't subject to IP laws and 3) that charming intervention
<br>
in the Florida presidential election.  Consensus isn't needed at all for major
<br>
changes in governmental policy.
