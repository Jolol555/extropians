<p>Don't worry, I'm not sitting  here tallying your extropian score,
<br>
planning to list who is extropiac and unextropic on the list :-) 
<br>
<p>Actually, I think your point is quite extropian, because you take a
<br>
different look at the situation from the traditional political one and
<br>
look for unorthodox solutions that help humanity advance better. I
<br>
especially like the idea of a mullah hotline, where the satphones can
<br>
connect the people to authoritative experts on islam - it manages to
<br>
leverage the influence of authority in islam into something useful,
<br>
while at the same time applying high tech for efficient subversion. 
<br>
<p>It is interesting to note how often we return to the theme of airdropped
<br>
satphones/miniterminals here. Maybe we are just lacking imagination, but
<br>
I think it shows that this - properly implemented - could be an
<br>
extremely powerful tool of good. Having people communicate better with
<br>
each other is nearly always good, and helps undermine elites. However,
<br>
so far to my knowledge no such airdrops have ever been udnertaken: are
<br>
there any organisations working on realizing this, or should we direct
<br>
our energy to convincing relief organisations that it is a good idea? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm unsure whether the capture of bin Laden and close associates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will &quot;solve&quot; the problem (I probably doubt that will be the case).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, then my gut feeling is that real nanotechnology and/or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity have been postponed by perhaps 5-10 years.
</em><br>
<p>My guess is that it has not changed the rate of progress with more than
<br>
a week; I think people worked far less that fateful September week than
<br>
normally, but I don't see that great redirection of action from
<br>
worthwhile pursuits now. Even a few billion less in research budgets is
<br>
not really a showstopper - people might do less expensive experiments,
<br>
spend time doing simulations rather than chemistry and so on; to really
<br>
delay things the money drain would have to be so large that research
<br>
groups in academia and industry are disbanded, and even then the
<br>
research can likely occur in other groups. I would say science is fairly
<br>
elastic in this respect.
