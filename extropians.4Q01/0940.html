<em>&gt;From: Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Anthrax%20addendum&In-Reply-To=&lt;200110151937.MAA01002@well.com&gt;">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;Then tell me exactly why we are talking about an indeterminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;war against an unknown number of targets in an unknown number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries.  Such a war should be shouted down immediately.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it isn't.  Why?  As bad as 911 was such a response is overboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and overly broad.
</em><br>
<p>Al Queda is a worldwide network of terrorist organizations,
<br>
operating out of over 60 countries at last count. We will need to
<br>
dismantle the entire network.
<br>
<p>I think we are on completely the right track at the moment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Laugh if you want to but it is a much more complicated world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than blase assumptions that we are the good guys and those are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the &quot;evil ones&quot; would lead you to believe. 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
I agree completely that the world is much more complicated than any
<br>
blase assumption. For example the terrorist organization known as
<br>
Al Queda is much more sophisticated than you give them credit for.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;We do not know there is any terrorism plot behind the anthrax
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scare according to experts.  Nor do we have evidence saying it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is done by any particular group that is more than extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flimsy.  That the Taliban are nasty folks does not say they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsible for all ills nor that an endless campaign that goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substantially beyond Afghanistan is in the least justified.  Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to mention the eviscerating of our own civil liberties.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that we do not know enough about the anthrax episode to
<br>
draw any conclusions yet, at least publicly.
<br>
<p>I have already explained the need for worldwide anti-terrorist
<br>
operations.
<br>
<p>I'm gratified to see that some of the new emergency laws being
<br>
passed have sunset provisions.
