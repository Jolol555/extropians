<p>
I strongly suspected the site was a hoax from the get-go:
<br>
<p>a) I would have heard about it as a scientist
<br>
b) I would have heard about it from those news sources
<br>
<p>two things immediately confirmed that: the links didn't properly indicate 
<br>
they went to CNN/MSNBC/etc., and the TIME cover had no date.
<br>
<p>So I don't see the site as making a serious attempt to confuse; like a 
<br>
photorealistic painting, I don't really think there's a car there but I am 
<br>
impressed by the skill in the depiction.  And the subject would certainly 
<br>
make you think, especially someone who's not already involved in discussions 
<br>
like ours.  I think it would be a value for people to realize that male 
<br>
pregnancy isn't incredibly far-out, just not currently practical.  I also 
<br>
like the implied point that, like the things you're &quot;liable to read in the 
<br>
bible&quot;, stuff on web pages &quot;ain't necessarily so.&quot;  All in all, good art.
