<em>&gt;Guidelines are good.  &quot;Zero-tolerance&quot; is bad.  Always.  It is something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we, as Extropians, should fight--and we can't fight it and practice it.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;It sounds like you are saying we should adopt a zero-tolerance policy
<br>
towards zero-tolerance policies.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Zero-tolerance policies are often good because the costs of judging
<br>
each individual case are much higher than the benefits of granting
<br>
exceptions, and much higher than the costs of enforcing a zero-tolerance
<br>
rule.
<br>
&nbsp;For example, if voters try to persuade government officials to use
<br>
their own judgement about each individual software patent application,
<br>
it's safe to assume that most voters won't be able to take the time to
<br>
evaluate the reasoning behind each decision. So voters who don't adopt
<br>
a zero-tolerance policy will end up not having much effect on the
<br>
decisions, leaving the result to special interests.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If impoliteness on the list and the danger that ExI might misuse its
<br>
authority to silence its critics were the biggest threats to the list,
<br>
then I would support a zero-tolerance policy towards ad hominem attacks.
<br>
&nbsp;If the rule were clearly restricted to dealing with arguments of the
<br>
type &quot;X is stupid, therefore the policy he is advocating is wrong&quot;, then
<br>
it would be pretty harmless.
<br>
&nbsp;But I suspect the rule is also intended to prohibit rude posts of
<br>
the form &quot;don't feed the trolls&quot; (i.e. &quot;please help maintain the list
<br>
quality by ignoring that idiot&quot;). I would rather see ExI engage in
<br>
some ad hominem posts of this nature than spend time worrying about
<br>
how to surpress the symptoms of a list that tolerates idiots.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Absolutely, but that's still 100 times better than leaving human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;judgment out of the loop entirely.  That's what makes people do silly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things like expelling a boy scout with a hatchet in the trunk of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;car for &quot;carrying a weapon&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I would say that unrealistic opinions about the costs and/or benefits
<br>
of possessing weapons are what causes results like this. Encouraging
<br>
officials to use more judgement in enforcing those rules would mainly
<br>
serve to hide the problems created by the rules.
