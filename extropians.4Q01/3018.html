<p>I just listened to the first hour, although the remainder should be
<br>
available at the artbell.com web site.  This was an interesting exchange
<br>
but I wasn't too happy with the way Ralph sidestepped the question.
<br>
Art wanted to know whether nanotech wouldn't be a terrible tool for those
<br>
who want to destroy human life.  This is a reasonable question especially
<br>
in light of recent events, and I think it needs to be answered squarely
<br>
and honestly, but it didn't seem to me that Ralph did that.  He never
<br>
really came out and said yes or no, he would try to change the subject
<br>
or just refuse to answer.  I thought he sounded evasive and unwilling
<br>
to admit that nanotech has a dark side.
