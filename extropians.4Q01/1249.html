THE BRAIN'S HALVES COOPERATE TO HELP US REMEMBER EVENTS, GIVING &quot;LEFTY FAMILY&quot;
<br>
MEMBERS BETTER EPISODIC MEMORY
<br>
<a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/neu.html">http://www.apa.org/journals/neu.html</a>
<br>
Findings also help explain why children don't remember events until about age
<br>
4, when the fibers connecting the halves fully develop
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON - Does coming from a family full of &quot;lefties&quot; tend to make a person
<br>
better at remembering events? The data from two recent experiments answer in
<br>
the affirmative. What's more, psychologists may finally be able to explain why
<br>
kids don't remember events until they are about four years old. This recent
<br>
research is reported in the October issue of Neuropsychology, published by the
<br>
American Psychological Association (APA).
<br>
<p>Stephen D. Christman, Ph.D., and Ruth E. Propper, Ph.D., of the University of
<br>
Toledo in Ohio, studied memory as a function of family handedness.
<br>
Interestingly, people don't have to be personally left-handed to share a
<br>
unique
<br>
trait: There is evidence that the two brain hemispheres of even right-handers
<br>
with left-handed relatives share functions more equally, interact more and are
<br>
connected by a larger corpus callosum (the bundle of mediating fibers) than
<br>
the
<br>
hemispheres of people with right-handed relatives. Although it is not well
<br>
understood, there is a hereditary component to handedness.
<br>
<p>Christman and Propper studied two types of memory -- episodic (the recall and
<br>
recognition of events) and non-episodic (factual memory and implicit memory,
<br>
the latter of which concerns things people &quot;just know&quot;). Strength or weakness
<br>
in either, says Christman, &quot;may not have much effect in educational settings,
<br>
as we can recall things we have learned by 'remembering' them (episodic
<br>
memory)
<br>
or by 'knowing' them (implicit memory). The main difference is that people who
<br>
'remember' can also recall details about the time and place at which they
<br>
first
<br>
learned this fact.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the first experiment, which studied 180 right-handed Air Force recruits at
<br>
Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Christman and Propper found that for
<br>
different types of word-memory tasks, participants with left-handed relatives
<br>
had superior episodic memory and inferior implicit memory, at a rate greater
<br>
than chance. The researchers therefore speculate that a higher level of
<br>
inter-hemispheric interaction facilitates episodic memory.
<br>
<p>In the second experiment, the authors studied episodic and semantic (factual)
<br>
memory in 84 right-handed undergraduates, studying what happened when they
<br>
presented words and letter strings to either one part of the brain or to both.
<br>
When Christman and Propper presented stimuli to one part of the brain,
<br>
participants remembered facts better. When the researchers presented stimuli
<br>
to
<br>
both halves of the brain, participants remembered events better -- again
<br>
supporting the role of inter-hemispheric processing in episodic memory.
<br>
<p>Christman and Propper conclude that because our brains' two halves work
<br>
together to help us remember events, people whose brains' halves work together
<br>
more actively (people with left-handedness in their families) remember events
<br>
better than they remember facts. As a result, the authors say that memory
<br>
studies should factor in the familial and probably personal handedness of
<br>
participants (having a weak versus strong hand preference may also matter).
<br>
Further research may help explain why episodic memory benefits from the two
<br>
halves working together, whereas factual/implicit memory is better processed
<br>
in
<br>
one half alone.
<br>
<p>The researchers stress that memory performance has nothing to do with
<br>
so-called
<br>
&quot;brain dominance.&quot; &quot;While the notion of people being right-brained or
<br>
left-brained is common in the popular press,&quot; says Christman, &quot;it has received
<br>
very little support in the scientific literature. Both hemispheres of all
<br>
people are going to be involved in virtually all tasks.&quot;
<br>
<p>Finally, the findings shed light on why children have no episodic memories
<br>
until about age 4. The onset of episodic memory roughly coincides with the
<br>
corpus callosum's maturation and myelinization, the growth of fatty protective
<br>
sheaths around nerve fibers. In light of the findings, it would mean that a
<br>
functional corpus callosum is critical in the formation of event memories and
<br>
therefore explain why its maturation in early childhood is at least partly
<br>
responsible for the emergence of episodic memory.
