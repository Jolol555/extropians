<br>
<p>Why do you feel I include you in this mindset?  Do you identify yourself

<p><em>&gt; I can counter by saying

</em><br>
<p>You are kidding are you not?
<br>
I've been lurking off and on since 94 or so, and this is not at all my
<br>
view. It seems massively dominated by (to me, a foreigner) insignificant
<br>
US political discussions which rapidly spiral out of hand and out of
<br>
control. It seems to me that far too much vitriol is spilt over mundane
<br>
issues when this list has a focus somewhat larger than that.  I reckon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The impression I have gotten is that a hell of a lot of other people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; feel the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way, leaving the list overpopulated with maniacs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but apparently not the maniacs you are thinking of.
</em><br>
<p>Well, one man's maniac is another man's freedom fighter, (or something
<br>
as clever).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The problem is, does *anyone* beleve america acts altruistically? Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if it does, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; considered dubious by most people. The Gulf War is a classic example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What surprises me is that the moral relativists have such difficultly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grasping the idea that just because America doesn't act according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; YOUR principles that it doesn't act according to its own as IT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understands them (NOT YOU). 
</em><br>
<p><p>Sorry, but I listen to the rhetoric as spouted by the US and then look
<br>
at it in action, and there's a vast shift.
<br>
I don't attempt to understand other people on my terms, I try to
<br>
understand them on their terms, and the US, while loudly proclaiming
<br>
itself the light of the modern world, isn't really. Not by a long shot.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'd think that people with such allegedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broad minds would be able to grasp, embrace, and even apologize for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things before breakfast.
</em><br>
<p>Well, perhaps we don't think the way you do? And why do you feel that if
<br>
people disagree with the US they are moral relativists? I'm just
<br>
pointing out a known hypocrite when I see one.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You have just described 90% of the Western world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but we don't all watch the same TV channels, do we? Some of us live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where most of the available media is not funded or produced by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government to fit its own agenda.
</em><br>
<p>Most of the Western world has access to far more US programming than
<br>
from any other country, so I'd say that a lot of us *do* share a
<br>
somewhat common TV culture. CNN for news, for example, which we get
<br>
here. Movies. Music. Rah rah rah.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course not. Popular world opinion is that either a) US military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces are a bunch of murderous raping criminals, or else b) that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are effete pampered pansies who can't put their combat boots on right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to the military in their own particular country.
</em><br>
<p>Well, dunno about elsewhere, but there is that attitude here, to an
<br>
extent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, it's obviously embarrassing to be seen asking for such infantry to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; join your particular cause.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the impression was that anywhere the US military goes into, US
<br>
spooks follow and the meddling starts, and I suspect that Australia was
<br>
jealous of anyone else meddling in her back yard.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, the various anti-american americans on the list miss the point-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is reacting to the &quot;intervention&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; by Osama bin Ladens forces on its soil, so the retaliation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Afghanistan is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; clearly different to other interventions in the past.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, allegedly retaliating, we have yet to see any evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After the NA forces complaining that we were not bombing enough to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; western press (I found it so hilarious that the US tv media was trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to embarrass the Bush administration by reporting the NA recommendations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we carpet bomb MORE villages).
</em><br>
<p>Oh no, I meant it is currently armed aggression against a sovereign
<br>
power, if we see the evidence it'll be retaliation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is significant that the various and bloody Soviet interventions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; never demonised in teh same way as american actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ??? You are joking, aren't you? There was a huge global outcry, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Moscow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Olympics were torpedoed, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We, the US, torpedoed the Moscow olympics by staying home, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recall many other countries staying home. Perhaps you can provide more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; info.
</em><br>
<p>uh-oh.
<br>
I'm offline right now, but I suspect we're going to know the answer.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many more of us feel we've lost control of our government to NGO special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests funded by millionaire/billionaire aristocrats like Ted Turner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Andrew MacKelvey.
</em><br>
<p>Really? You honestly feel that NGO special interests have more influence
<br>
over the US government than corporations? Really? I understand your
<br>
penchant for wild rhetoric, but, really?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think you'd find that if NZ was a world-striding collossus like the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then the NZ govt would be highly imperialistic, the same as the govt of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all major world Powers are, sort of goes with the turf. NZ can afford to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be idealistic as the biggest threat to NZ is an invasion from Samoa.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If NZ were stuck in the middle of Africa or Asia then I suspect things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be a wee tad different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A very good point. NZ can afford a principled isolationist stance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically for the same reasons the US could afford the same prior to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WWII: you can't git theyuh frum heyah.... that easily.
</em><br>
<p>Yup. And I'm sure if NZ was in the situation the US is in now with
<br>
respect to world dominance there'd be lots of critics of NZ foreign
<br>
policy.
