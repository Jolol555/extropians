One of the many problems with the old conventional ideas of missile defense is that it
<br>
assumes the best way for a terrorist to get a nuclear bomb into the USA is in the nosecone
<br>
of a ICBM. That's crazy. Not counting trucks and railroads about 16,000 cargo containers
<br>
enter the USA every day by sea, these are sealed boxes about 8 feet by 8 feet
<br>
and 40 feet long, they can weigh up to 40 tons. It can take hours to hand search
<br>
one of these things so only about 1% are ever even cracked open, the vast
<br>
majority are never inspected at all. There are high power X ray machines that can
<br>
photograph the contents in about a minute, they also set off a automatic alarm if
<br>
they detect the density signature of Uranium, Plutonium or chemical explosives.
<br>
These machines are already in use in Israel and the Netherlands but not here.
<br>
They cost about $10,000,000 but theoretically if they were in operation 24 hours
<br>
a day the country would only need about 15. Of course in the real world you'd need
<br>
more, especially if you wanted to keep open all 300 ports of entry we have now but
<br>
even so it would be far cheaper than a star wars laser battleship and would give us
<br>
much more security.
<br>
<p>Now all we have to worry about every day is 348,000 private cars, 2,600 airplanes
<br>
and 38,000 trucks and railcars.
