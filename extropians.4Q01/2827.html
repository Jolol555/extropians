<em>&gt; &gt; These feelings have some good reasons (some of the interventions

<em>&gt; &gt; mentionned here these days, etc.), and some bad reasons (false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; representations, jealousy, blaming your misfortunes on someone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and escaping your responsability, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think the resentment is bad, not (only) because it is so sad for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US to be misunderstood, but because it allows leaders in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; countries to bring their countries in destructive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; auto-destructive directions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for sure europe is against :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)restrictions in freedom - especially internet freedom, freedom of speech, and cognitive freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; america is totalitarian country, so it is not strange that EU contries help afghanistan  - US have their enemy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and gives time for EU - they can arm, they can watch us spies in EU more carefully.
</em><br>
<p>Courious, I find this a rather curious statement. It is, after all,
<br>
France and Germany who sued eBay to prevent independent individuals from
<br>
selling Nazi memorabilia on the internet. It is also european nations
<br>
who are leading the way against private use of encryption and internet
<br>
privacy. France decries the Echelon project while concurrently spending
<br>
more money spying on the US than any other intelligence service in the
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>We also trust our citizens with more power than any european nation
<br>
does, with the possible exception of Switzerland.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i live in poland, where american WOD just began.. i is interesting that ppl not want any WOD.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they try to minimise costs of such war, they boicotted the elections this year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarchy is on rise now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and - yes - many blame USA for this - especiallty Wolrd Trade Center organisation.
</em><br>
<p>Let me get this straight: you say that anarchist groups, which are
<br>
funded primarily by communist parties and an eastern european mafia
<br>
known as 'the 5th' which is manned by former KGB and other communist
<br>
intel/ops people and gets its funds from the opium/heroin trade from
<br>
Afghanistan to europe and the US, are entirely the fault of the WTO and
<br>
the US's War on Drugs?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so i think whole world is against USA, after discovering neurochemistry which makes WOD just a economical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; task. USA imprisoned so many INTELLIGENT NONVIOLENT ppl while doing WOD that the WW3 will end when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goverement of USA will be directed to PSYCHIATRIC WARD - diagnosis? paranoid schizophrenia.
</em><br>
<p>While the US has imprisoned a lot of nonviolent drug users, there are
<br>
plenty of rather violent drug dealers and drug users sitting in prison
<br>
as well. At least 3/4 of the crime rate in the US is due to the poverty
<br>
created by drug use.
