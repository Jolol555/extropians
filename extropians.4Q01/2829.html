<em>&gt;From: Charlie Stross &lt;<a href="mailto:charlie@antipope.org?Subject=Re:%20If%20we%20do%20get%20Afghanistan,%20what%20shall%20we%20do%20with%20it?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200111191659.IAA17125@well.com&gt;">charlie@antipope.org</a>&gt;

<br>
<em>&gt;The question presupposes that cultural engineering is *possible*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With all due respect, I don't believe it is -- at least, not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this context. The west has _not_ conquered and occupied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan. All that's happend is that the Taliban's morale has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;broken and their old rivals have scored some victories in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civil war that's been raging for about fifteen years. The cities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are honey-traps; they don't actually have a significant industrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;base, and actually nailing the Taliban will require occupying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the country and cutting off their recruiting base.
</em><br>
<p><p>Excellent points. The Talibans main recruiting base is the
<br>
Pakistani Madrassas.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This doesn't mean the Taliban can win, any more than the Khmer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rouge could in 1978 (after Vietnam responded to their cross-border
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorist activities by invading). But it doesn't make them a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-factor, either. Look at how thoroughly the Khmer Rouge screwed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cambodia over the next couple of decades for an example of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_could_ happen if we break out the champagne prematurely.
</em><br>
<p>More good points. But defeating Bin Laden would be cause for
<br>
celebration. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan isn't a country with a distinct national and cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identity; the nearest analogy I can come up with is Yugoslavia. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has traditionally been a crossroads between Empires, and has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;population of tribal groups who in many cases don't even speak the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same language and who hate each other virulently.
</em><br>
<p><p>Which is why U.N. peacekeepers will be required.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Into this mix, add religious beliefs of a remarkably fanatical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;variety, shored up by the religious schools in Pakistan who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bankrolled by rich Arabian Wahabbites. Then add an illiteracy rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of 70% among  men, rising to 90% among women. 
</em><br>
<p><p>They will need to be taught something new. I am in favor of
<br>
eliminating the current madrassas curriculum.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You can't educate people who can't read and don't speak your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;language.
</em><br>
<p><p>It will be necessary to begin with basic skills.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I therefore conclude that if our governments decided to opt for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social engineering, and reform, it'll take two whole generations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to re-program enough of the population to ensure stability and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liberalism. Two generations, moreover, without a running guerilla
</em><br>
<em>&gt;war or the jackboot of foreign infidel oppression for the mullahs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to rail against.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think it can be accomplished in less time but will require
<br>
considerable effort.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Given that the political horizon in the west is about two years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away, I don't hold out much hope of this happening. It's far too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much of a long-term committment for a democracy to undertake. Now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Soviet government could conceive of such projects, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weren't hampered by the short-termism of western politicians.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is clearly U.N. territory.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Stop brow-beating yourself and start worrying about the effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dealing with barbarians is going to have on _our_ core values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Speaking as a hard- core liberal, I'm more worried about detention
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without judicial review and military tribunals getting a toe-hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the west than I am about western values teaching the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tribesmen how to read and write.
</em><br>
<p>While no one is proposing these things for citizens, I agree that
<br>
this will require watching.
