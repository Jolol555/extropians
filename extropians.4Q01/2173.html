</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there any &quot;real&quot; evidence that the Fed is completely to blame here?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the Fed is completely to blame, though it is mostly to blame.
<br>
This does not come from hindsight either.  Many free banking theorists
<br>
(e.g., Kevin Dowd), Austrian economists (e.g., most of the people at the
<br>
Ludwig von Mises Institute), and even some writers at _The Economists_ were
<br>
predicting an eventual bust in the late 1990s.
<br>
<p>Other factors that have played a role -- albeit a minor one -- are the
<br>
pattern and mode of government intervention in the market.  By this, I mean
<br>
things like previous bailouts and current ones.  This not only interferes in
<br>
the market, but sets up a pattern of expectations.  (Heck, if you knew ahead
<br>
of time that the government would bail out your business, wouldn't you be
<br>
much more likely to take more risks and not have as big a cash reserve,
<br>
etc. -- all other things being equal?)
<br>
<p>Anderson and others (I've even sent a number of articles to this list over
<br>
the past year or so making pretty much the same claims as him) have provided
<br>
data on this.  Some of this can be found at <a href="http://www.mises.org/">http://www.mises.org/</a> Of course,
<br>
the full picture is not in, but the main features have been established.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could there not also be some blame to be shared by the economists who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were pointing out the tremendous gains in productivity that were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being attributed to the application of information technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (finally),
</em><br>
<p>Well, different economists made different predictions -- based on different
<br>
beliefs and models.  There were actually gains in productivity, BUT these
<br>
were despite Fed policy NOT because of it.  Also, not all economists are in
<br>
a position to have an impact -- either because they don't have the
<br>
government's ear or because they are not that popular.  Even the court
<br>
economists -- people like Lester Thurow (as some say, he's &quot;less thorough
<br>
than the others.&quot;:) and Paul Krugman (an unreconstructed Keynesian who
<br>
graces the pages of the NYT) -- only add intellectual support.  They don't
<br>
actual make policy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or to the accumulation of wealth that migrated into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hands of VCs who spent it all too often on yet-another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dot-com business plan,
</em><br>
<p>The problem with blaming them is that it's like blaming the victim.  A VC or
<br>
an investment bank, for the most part, operates inside the scope of the
<br>
Fed's policies.  (Granted, some are influential with the Fed and with the
<br>
government, but the solution to this is clear: remove or minimize their
<br>
influence.  This can be done by reducing the powers of the Fed or, as I
<br>
prefer, abolishing it completely.)  So, if the Fed sets interests rates too
<br>
low, the VC doesn't see that as something he or she can change.  It's like
<br>
if the government sets the price of milk too low.  Is the consumer of milk
<br>
to blame for buying more milk at the lower price?  Or is the bad policy --
<br>
and those who put it into place and enforce it -- to blame?  (See below.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or on the newly minted stock owning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public who felt they had to play the market at never-before-seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P/E ratios or risk losing the lottery?
</em><br>
<p>Again, if the Fed hadn't created an environment where people would take such
<br>
undue risks, this would be a marginal issue.  A few might still gamble their
<br>
life savings and remortgage the home for the latest IPO, but most would not.
<br>
However, most of the blame falls squarely on the bad policy again.  If the
<br>
bad policy did not exist, then the incentives would not be there -- and the
<br>
market signals would not be confused.  (See below.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To argue that the Fed caused the recession by fueling a boom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with low interest rates and then to argue that they cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create another boom with similar methods seems to argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the principles are only in effect when the economists want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to be.
</em><br>
<p>At first glance, your arguments seems to make sense.  However, the problem
<br>
is a little more complex than this.  Some use the analogy of getting drunk
<br>
to feel good.  Once you get a hangover, is the solution just to continue
<br>
drinking until the pain goes away?  You can see where that would lead:
<br>
ultimately, death by alcohol poisoning.
<br>
<p>But even this is only an analogy.  What actually happens under inflation is
<br>
a lot more complicated.  Let me use another analogy.  The government could
<br>
set the price of some good, let's say oranges, below the market rate.  This
<br>
would lead to shortages of oranges as it became less profitable or even
<br>
unprofitable to grow and sell oranges.  Initially, however, before the
<br>
shortage really set in -- while there were still stocks of oranges to be
<br>
sold and which would go bad if unsold (so the owners of these stocks would
<br>
rather sell and get something than not sell and get nothing) -- the orange
<br>
market might boom.  People might start eating more oranges.  Restaurants
<br>
might sell orange juice and orange dishes at lower prices and so on.  When
<br>
the shortage actually hit, businesses that relied on the orange trade would
<br>
go bust, slowly or suddenly, depending on their reserves, how closely they
<br>
were tied to oranges, and whether they were flexible enough to move into
<br>
another line of work.  (This might include an effect on the creditors of
<br>
orange growers, farm hands at orange plantations, and the like -- to
<br>
illustrate how the effect would ripple outward.)
<br>
<p>This analogy fits a little better than the alcohol one.
<br>
<p>Now, let's take a look at how [government control of] interest rates impacts
<br>
an economy.  Unlike oranges, money is traded in every market in a modern
<br>
economy.  This is another way of saying that a) there's no specialized
<br>
market for money itself and b) money is a part of almost every exchange
<br>
(e.g., you trade your money for a cup of coffee, you client or employer
<br>
trades her or his money for your product/service/labor, the orange grower
<br>
trades oranges for money, etc.).  This makes changes in money much more
<br>
important than changes in any other good.  (Money is simply the most traded
<br>
good in any economy.)  So, anything that impacts money will impact all else,
<br>
often very quickly, but not always at the same rate or to the same degree.
<br>
<p>Now, interest rates are, if set by the market, a reflection of how people
<br>
(which make up the market: the market is just people's interactions) value
<br>
the future.  If I'm willing, e.g., to pay you $110 in one year for $100 now,
<br>
then I prefer the present at a rate of 10% per anum over the future --
<br>
assuming I won't accept a higher rate of interest.  (Why does this phenomena
<br>
arise?  It's known as &quot;time preference&quot; and results from the fact that the
<br>
future is always uncertain.  Thus, wealth had right now is always much more
<br>
valuable because certain over wealth to be had in the future because this is
<br>
always uncertain.  You could lose your job, the market could crash, the
<br>
business not work out, you could have an unexpected new cost imposed, etc.
<br>
Of course, people vary in how much they value the present over the future.
<br>
Some people spend like mad, while others scrimp and save.  Even the same
<br>
individual at different times can value the differences more or less.  The
<br>
young, e.g., tend to be more present-centered than the middle aged.
<br>
Incentives can also impact this.  During wartime people tend to be even more
<br>
uncertain about the future.  And so on.)
<br>
<p>What can go wrong with interest rates?  They could be too high or too low.
<br>
Too high an interest rates results in deflation -- i.e., there will be less
<br>
loanable funds then the market [effectively] demands.  The effect of
<br>
deflation is usually immediately noticeable -- business inventories rise,
<br>
some prices drop but sales also drop -- so it's typically not a big problem
<br>
at any time.  This doesn't mean it's good, but because of its immediate
<br>
effects, the correction is usual swift.  (It's the monetary equivalent of
<br>
having too high a price for oranges.  If the government fixes the price of
<br>
oranges too high, a lot more oranges will be made than bought.)
<br>
<p>Too low an interest rates results in inflation -- i.e., there will be more
<br>
loanable funds then the market [effectively] demands.  The effects of
<br>
inflation, however, are not immediately noticeable and do not seem to be all
<br>
that bad.  Investments will increase in certain areas and the economy will
<br>
appear to boom.  Prices will rise, as the loanable funds make their way
<br>
through the economy.  Eventually, however, the increased investing will not
<br>
be profitable and that's where the bust comes in.
<br>
<p>Even under a totally free market in banking -- and we're very far from that
<br>
indeed (no place in the US hasn't been close to such a state since circa
<br>
1860) -- banks might guess the rate wrong, but the effect under such a
<br>
system is much more muted because of two things.  Free market banks have an
<br>
incentive to get it right.  Deflation causes an immediate loss in market
<br>
share and profits as other banks will compete for loan customers.  (This is
<br>
akin to one orange grower charging really high prices for the same quality
<br>
of orange.  All things being equal, the other orange growers will get more
<br>
business, make more sales.)  Inflation causes a loss in specie (or whatever
<br>
the outside money is) from the inflating bank and, if this goes on long
<br>
enough, that bank may even go bankrupt as other banks cash in on it's newly
<br>
created loans and money.
<br>
<p>Free market banks also have the information to get it right, since they can
<br>
watch their reserves inflows and outflows and their profitability.
<br>
<p>The Fed does not have either of these: its has neither the incentive nor the
<br>
information to get it right.  In fact, to some extent, it has the incentive
<br>
to err on the side of inflation.  Why?  For one, inflation is harder to
<br>
recognize.  It also increases, in the short run, profits, investment, and
<br>
employment.  The last makes it especially palatable for politicians.
<br>
Thirdly, it lowers the government's debt (lower interest rates means loans
<br>
for the government as less costly to the government).  This makes it more
<br>
likely that inflationary policies will be more popular with politicians,
<br>
workers, and the government.  (It also, in the long run, since most people
<br>
don't make the connection, increases the Fed's power.  The more economic
<br>
problems there are, the more the Fed has to interfere and the more power it
<br>
has historically been given, from the Great Depression to today.)
<br>
<p>Now, add to this, the exact path of inflation (or deflation) is, beforehand,
<br>
unknown.  That most of the 1990s boom would be absorbed into high stock
<br>
prices was not a factor someone would have been able to predict accurately
<br>
in 1993.  This is because, ex ante, the path inflation takes through the
<br>
economy is unknown in all cases.  Market information is always imperfect and
<br>
markets are always in disequilibrium, more or less.
<br>
<p>This does not mean inflation can do anything.  When the Fed lowers interest
<br>
rates (below market rates), it is distorting the economy.  The exact outcome
<br>
of this distortion can only be known in general outlines.  Inflation will
<br>
travel unevenly too.  The first to be impact will, naturally be those who
<br>
immediately take advantage of the lower interest rates -- such as the big
<br>
investors and big debtors.  They will then, because they have more money on
<br>
hand (or look more profitable or can leverage even more credit) bid up the
<br>
prices of the goods and services they use or plan to use.  The supplies of
<br>
those goods and services when then also become more profitable (though less
<br>
so than the initial beneficiaries).  And so on.
<br>
<p>Eventually, as you might note, this will change the relative prices of goods
<br>
and services.  In the late 1990s boom, e.g., the price of technology stocks
<br>
and of technology workers shot up dramatically.  (I know my salary shot up
<br>
during this period.)  As you might guess, this draws resources (money,
<br>
people, etc.) away from other areas of use.  This is why people like Murray
<br>
Rothbard (e.g., in _America's Great Depression_) say it's not overinvestment
<br>
per se that inflation creates, but malinvestment.  All things being equal,
<br>
absent the below market rates, the technology sector might still have grown,
<br>
but not at the crazy unsustainable rate we saw.  As we know with hindsight,
<br>
a lot of these things were bad investments.
<br>
<p>They weren't bad because they were all fly-by-night operations.  (Some were.
<br>
Easy money attracts people with loose morals.)  A lot of them were well
<br>
planned and planned to stick around for years to come.  However, the market
<br>
for their products wasn't there or didn't grow at the rate they predicted.
<br>
(I was part of such a concern until a few weeks ago.)  Much of this -- not
<br>
all, because it's natural for businesses to fail too -- was the result of
<br>
inflation messing up market signals.  By lowering interest rates, business,
<br>
investors, etc. planned for a different kind of world than could be built.
<br>
<p>Relowering the rates is not the solution either.  This will only lead to
<br>
more malinvestments -- if there's really anything left to invest in -- and
<br>
create ever more distortions.  The best thing to do now is get interest
<br>
rates back to a market level -- but the best way to do this is to have a
<br>
free market in banking.  Even with that, there will still be unrecoverable
<br>
costs associated with inflation.  Inflation (and deflation) do real damage.
<br>
Horwitz goes over some of these costs in his &quot;The Costs of Inflation
<br>
Revisited&quot; (forthcoming in _The Review of Austrian Economics_), a draft of
<br>
which is online at <a href="http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Papers/wpmain.htm">http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Papers/wpmain.htm</a>.  (I covered
<br>
some of this in the early months of this year.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't disagree in general with the points being made, I just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object to the idea of an argument of the form &quot;A is true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the Fed can cause a boom) except when an economist doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want it to be true (it won't work this time)&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>See above.  I think this explains why you might think that, but that's only
<br>
at a prima facie look at Anderson's claims.  He's talking about an
<br>
unsustainable boom -- not a boom in general.
<br>
<p>See also the link below and the Horwitz book reviewed there.  I also
<br>
recommend Kevin Dowd's _Laissez-Faire Banking_ and _Money and Markets:
<br>
Essays on Free Banking_ and George A. Selgin's _The Theory of Free Banking:
<br>
Money Supply under Competitive Note Issue_.  There are also many at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mises.org/">http://www.mises.org/</a> articles on inflation and the current recession.
