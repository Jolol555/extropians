<p>Frank Tipler has a good article on mature interstellar travel at
<br>
<a href="http://math.tulane.edu/~tipler/wired.html">http://math.tulane.edu/~tipler/wired.html</a> (apparently a shorter version
<br>
was published in Wired).

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year is 2100. AI's and human downloads have begun to explore and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colonize interstellar space. The spaceships carrying the AI's and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human downloads are tiny, massing no more than a kilogram. Quantum
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computers, which can code more bytes of information in 400 atoms than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there are atoms in the entire visible universe, do not require much
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mass. An entire simulated city with thousands of humans and AI's can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be coded in a few grams. And a tiny spaceship has a huge advantage
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the ponderous rockets of today. Powered by matter- antimatter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;annihilation, such tiny spaceships can reach 90% of lightspeed with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only a few kilograms of fuel. At such a speed, the nearest star,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some four and one-half light years away, will be reached in only five
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years. Acceleration to 90% of lightspeed will be very fast, because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the downloads and AI's will be impervious to acceleration. Humans not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;living in computers can take only a few gravities of acceleration,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and can take that small acceleration only for a short time. Simulated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humans will experience only the usual one gravity acceleration in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their simulated environment. Human downloads have such a natural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advantage over present-day humans in the environment of space, that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is exceedingly unlikely non-downloaded humans will ever engage
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in interstellar travel. The stars are to be the inheritance of our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;downloaded descendants, of the children of our minds rather than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our bodies.
