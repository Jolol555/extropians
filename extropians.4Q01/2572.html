<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Do the US already effectively communicate their views to the people, in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; According to the latest Economist, it started just this last week. Before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this last week, the US administration's broadcast presented in English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lame messages (&quot;Attention Taliban. You are condemned. Did you know that?&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now diplomats are responding directly on the local al-Jazeera network,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; giving interviews in Arabic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the info. That's certainly good (I couldn't find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translated transcripts of the interviews with Google though). I still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that something that lasts could be useful. Words said on TV are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readily wiped out by persuasion from people present in your physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And answering (hostile) questions is not the same as freely choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to introduce yourself in some way. Something that all could refer to,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and discuss ; and that Americans would somehow endorse, too (compare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with talks of diplomats we don't even know about). Something a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeper, broader...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I heard some Afghanis were actually convinced by the Talibans that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food dropped by US airplanes was poisonned, and starved to death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of eating it...
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I very much doubt this last as many of the Afghanis
<br>
are now at the point of ruining their stomachs eating grass they
<br>
are so hungry.  The truth is that not nearly enough food is now
<br>
available to prevent the deaths of millions.  And no, it is not,
<br>
or not just, the fault of the Taliban.  The country has been
<br>
ravaged by war and various repressive regimes for 3 decades. 
<br>
Its agricultural and economic understructure is a total shambles
<br>
and was even before the bombing.  The vast majority of food aid
<br>
used to come by truck convoy from Pakistan.  We stopped those
<br>
convoys on or around September 16.  The food packets we have
<br>
dropped have been only a drop in the bucket of what is needed if
<br>
millions are to avoid death by starvation, malnutrion and
<br>
opportunistic disorders as a result of that and/or exposure.
