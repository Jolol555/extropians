<p><em>&gt;Perhaps you should consider the claim that it was roughly 80

</em><br>
<p>We should try to remember that Islam is as fractionalized as
<br>
Christianity. There is a big difference between the many general
<br>
forms of Islam and the fierce absolutism of Deobandi Islam taught
<br>
in the Pakistani madrassas. Think along the lines of an even more
<br>
right wing Jerry Falwell. Think fundamentalists.
<br>
<p>We should not however buy into the nonsense that this somehow all
<br>
our fault. It is typical to blame a scapegoat, especially one that
<br>
is well off, for all your problems. The poor in this country
<br>
generally try to scapegoat the rich for example. Don't let them
<br>
guilt you.
<br>
<p>We should continue to go after those responsible for the atrocity,
<br>
and their sponsors, while at the same time doing everything humanly
<br>
possible to protect the neutral, and the innocent.
<br>
<p>And it's wouldn't hurt to start thinking about the endgame. As soon
<br>
as we're willing to admit publicly that toppling the Taliban is
<br>
part of the game plan, we should alert the U.N. so that peace
<br>
keeping troops and humanitarian assistance can be prepared to help
<br>
rebuild a very troubled land.
<br>
<p>We can count in aid dollars who is just talk.
