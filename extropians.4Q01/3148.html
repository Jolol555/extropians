<p><em>&gt; A show of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devastating, overwhelming, terrifying force against an enemy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was clearly the agressor, leaving him no choice but total 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconditional surrender, accomplished exactly the right goal: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war over, lives saved, no questions.
</em><br>
<p>As documented below -- the question whether lives were saved remains
<br>
quite undecided.
<br>
<p>However, one point that has not yet been mentioned might be the
<br>
importance of demonstrating that we had the weapons to Stalin.
<br>
You have to remember that Stalin had *no* reservations about
<br>
having millions of his own citizens killed.  How much the Western
<br>
allies knew about and feared Stalin at the end of WWII would make an
<br>
interesting research project.  As I recall the allies pushed quite
<br>
hard to take as much of Germany as possible to prevent Russia
<br>
from grabbing the entire country.  Now if Russia *had* grabbed
<br>
Germany, it remains a pretty interesting question whether they
<br>
would have stopped there -- one has to remember how much Napoleon
<br>
had cost them (old greivances die hard).  If Stalin had taken
<br>
Germany and then France he certainly would have taken all of
<br>
mainland Europe -- that would have been a very different world.
<br>
<p>So dropping the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagisaki may have
<br>
been essential to stopping the Russian war machine.
<br>
<p>While the &quot;demonstration&quot; in a non-populated area might have been
<br>
a nice idea -- it could have been seen as nothing more than saber
<br>
rattling.  And since I'm fairly sure that we only had 2 bombs
<br>
at that time saber rattling would have been a poor use of ones
<br>
resources.

<p><em>&gt; I think that if the United States had realized, that far back in time, how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much the threat of nuclear war - and later, nanotechnological war and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological war - would hang over the heads of future generations, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct decision would have been to spend the lives necessary to subdue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Japan the hard way. [snip] ... that who wins or loses some war  between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations isn't worth dragging existential risks (planetary risks) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the equation.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but the &quot;threat of nuclear war&quot; has been exaggerated. See:
<br>
<a href="http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm">http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Now, of course many people would be killed and development might
<br>
be set back for a generation or more but it doesn't look like
<br>
it wipes out humanity.  Actually the developments of the cold
<br>
war, such as submarines powered by nuclear reactors, seem to
<br>
me to have actually *increased* our chances of surviving both
<br>
nuclear wars and near-extinction level cometary/asteroid impacts.
<br>
<p>As I've discussed previously, biological weapons are pretty poor
<br>
for the purposes of &quot;war&quot;, but are sometimes useful for terrorism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not a good precedent if some country other than the US is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first to acquire military nanotechnology. This does not help the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US's argument for nuclear nonproliferation.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think it will be unlikely to be a problem if any
<br>
secular democratic society acquires military nanotechnology.
<br>
We've generally avoided the use of offensive technologies
<br>
unless we are attacked first.  Now whether they would be used
<br>
for covert operations remains an open question.  If the small
<br>
arial drown reconnaissance technology is an example, military
<br>
nanotechnology might actually save lives since the *really* bad
<br>
apples who promote terrorism can be surgically removed.
<br>
<p>Now, of course the risks become whether or not one turns those
<br>
technologies against ones own citizens or whether they become
<br>
tools that political parties use against one another.  Those are
<br>
cases where &quot;first use&quot; really threatens to open a can of worms.

<p>I found this comment rather interesting:
<br>
&quot;The Japs expected an American invasion of Kyushu, sometime in late 1945 or
<br>
early 1946 and if such invasion were to occur the Japs had plans in place
<br>
to murder their 400,000 Allied prisoners immediately. US Army Intelligence
<br>
estimated that US forces would take 1 million casualties with a Kyushu
<br>
invasion.&quot;
