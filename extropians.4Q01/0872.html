<em>&gt; &gt; This comes back to the old debate about what conditions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; necessary before we agree we must watch every person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everywhere always.

<p>Why?  We would still get cold.  Did you mean we would have zero
<br>
privacy?  Im already over that.
<br>
<p>Im looking at the big picture.  On a spaceship, anyone there could
<br>
conceivably kill everyone by punching a hole in the skin of the
<br>
craft.  Our planet is coming to be more like a space station in
<br>
that the individual gains ever more ability to slay ever more people.
<br>
At some time future we reach the point where anyone can slay
<br>
everyone.  At that time, I do not expect anyone would be banging
<br>
the right to privacy drum.  As that day approaches, how do we
<br>
decide how much privacy should be ensured?  spike
