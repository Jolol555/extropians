<em>&gt; The Palestinians lost their land when they joined the rest of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They have continued to miss every opportunity to regain it ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since. They have waged a war of terror which continues to this day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is the single major stumbling block from reaching a settlement.
</em><br>
<p>Is it really?  While I've heard the claim that the Palestinians are 
<br>
being offered sweetheart deals from Israel I've also heard conflicting 
<br>
claims that Israel isn't really giving up very much.  The most recent 
<br>
number I heard is that Israel currently controls over 70% of the 
<br>
original Palestine/Israel territory, when they're supposed to only 
<br>
control 50%.  Areas like the Golan Heights are supposed to be part of 
<br>
Palestine, but are so overly occupied by imported Ukranians that Israel 
<br>
refuses to give them up.
<br>
<p>I don't claim to know everything about the situation, but what I do know 
<br>
smacks of unfairness.  With the Russians out of the picture, why are we 
<br>
supporting that unfairness with our financial and military might?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Both Jordan and Syria occupy former Palestinian land and isn't it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funny that you never hear boo about it?
</em><br>
<p>Where Jordanian and Syrian governments are in control of the territory, 
<br>
Muslims aren't treated as second-class citizens.  From what I know, Jews 
<br>
in Israel actually have extra constitutional rights and protections.  
<br>
Palestinians can freely enter and leave Jordan and Syria, but in Israel 
<br>
they have to obtain special papers and permits.  To me, it's no surprise 
<br>
that Palestinians consider Israel to be the greatest threat in all this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Don't get me wrong, I'd like to see this set right, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Palestinians are every bit as much at fault, if not more so, than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Israelis.
</em><br>
<p>See, that's where I'm not so sure.  With our media and government so 
<br>
much under the influence of Jewish media moguls, have we as Americans 
<br>
been getting a reasonably objective view of the events in Israel and the 
<br>
Middle East?  From my conversations with friends outside of the US 
<br>
media-sphere, I get the feeling that the Palestinians are much less at 
<br>
fault than we've been lead to believe.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Also, this is more than just about Israel.  This is also about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; continued US support for puppet regimes like in Saudi Arabia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Kuwait.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Sure, the US talks a good game about democracy and freedom, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Middle Easterners who would wish to have freedom and democracy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their own countries have to not only battle their own governments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but also the dollars and military of the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what right to we have to go around kicking in governments?
</em><br>
<p>Straw man.  Who said anything about &quot;kicking in governments&quot;?  I'd just 
<br>
like us to get out of the whole area.  Leave Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  
<br>
Let those governments stabilize and defend themselves.  If they want 
<br>
help in creating secular democracies, then it's probably worth it for us 
<br>
to give them a hand.  Currently, though, I don't understand why we're 
<br>
supporting the countries that we are.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Liberals always want to have things both ways.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, man.  I certainly hope that you're not calling me a liberal.  Them's 
<br>
fightin' words.  I'd characterize myself as a libertarian, or at worst 
<br>
an atheistic conservative.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The Cold War is over.  This support of the &quot;lesser of evils&quot; no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; longer makes the sense that it did a couple of decades ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which is better, a corrupt government or a fundamentalist one?
</em><br>
<p>Who knows?  In this case, the corrupt one was more predisposed to us 
<br>
because of our past intervention on their behalf, and because they know 
<br>
that our continued support is required for them to stay in power.  Then 
<br>
again, our occupation of Saudi Arabia is one of the prime reasons why we 
<br>
just lost over 6,000 people and billions of dollars.  Maybe supporting 
<br>
the fundamentalist one would have been cheaper.
<br>
<p>We should just get the hell out of the support business for governments 
<br>
that are fundamentalist, corrupt, or both.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; I'd rather see us withdraw from the Middle East completely than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; continue to be embarrassed about our policies there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are places in the middle east where we are welcome, Kuwait
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example.
</em><br>
<p>Of course we are.  They've gotten filthy rich selling us oil at 
<br>
collusion-obtained prices (OPEC), yet when they have trouble with their 
<br>
neighbors, we take care of it for them.  A lot of good it did for our 
<br>
oil prices this past summer when they went along with all of the other 
<br>
OPEC nations in reducing production.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
