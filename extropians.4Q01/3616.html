From: &quot;Brian Atkins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:brian@posthuman.com?Subject=Re:%20Gene-engineer%20superhumans?&In-Reply-To=&lt;012801c17a0e$47ec8be0$c8c8f418@southmount.com&gt;">brian@posthuman.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; How many millions/billions $ are going into biotech and related fields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right now? Lots. And how many are going into developing Real AI ? Zero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think we are in any danger yet of spending too much on AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development. .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --
</em><br>
I agree that the funding situation is not to our liking. In fact, I have
<br>
argued in the past that the present science-funding situation is
<br>
fundamentally irrational, if the goal is to attempt to obtain the complete
<br>
truth of everything consider as a whole (as Plato says). (Of course if the
<br>
goal of science is to make busy work for humans then this is a different
<br>
matter).. It makes more sense for science for science to pour money into
<br>
making Superintelligences rather than supercollidors. The weak link in the
<br>
science process is probably not our experimental apparatus but the
<br>
congenital limitations of our theorizers. Nevertheless, I was not suggesting
<br>
diverting monetary resources from AI to G.E. I am suggesting that our
<br>
intellectual resources might be allocated in part by thinking a bit more
<br>
about the G.E. back-up plan. If it helps, I am working on a transhumanist
<br>
cheer: &quot;Three cheers for SIAI, two cheers for G.E., go team go.&quot; Not exactly
<br>
catchy but the sentiment is right.
