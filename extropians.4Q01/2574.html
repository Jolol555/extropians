<em>&gt; &gt; Dear Curious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Don't you think that with your penname, you might want to visit there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and see for yourself?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're both right. America is borderline totalitarian b/c corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are attempting to control the speech of individuals on the pretext of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protecting trademarks and copyrights. Europe is full of borderline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialists anxious to protect the public against 'hate speech'. Each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is trying to export its brand of censorship to the other. Both appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be succeeding. Soon all will stand together in gagged and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blindfolded unity.
</em><br>
<p><p>i think usa will need polish hackers pretty soon. 
<br>
indeed - try to find them @ home ;-) smoking joint's somewhere... broken pipe.
<br>
<p><p>they're all alike.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; * I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
</em><br>
&lt;DI&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; * honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * and its Jihad.&quot; 
</em><br>
&lt;HALT&gt;
