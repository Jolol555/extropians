<p>Oncolytics Biotech Inc. Announces REOLYSIN(R) Phase I
<br>
&nbsp;Clinical Trial Interim Results
<br>
<p>&nbsp;07:31 EST Thursday, December 13, 2001
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CALGARY, AB, Dec. 13 /PRNewswire/ - Oncolytics Biotech Inc.
<br>
(TSE: ONC, NASDAQ: ONCY) (Oncolytics) announced interim results
<br>
of its Phase I clinical trial of REOLYSIN(R), a potential cancer
<br>
therapeutic for RAS activated tumours and cancers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phase I trial was designed as a dose escalation study to
<br>
determine the safety and tolerance of REOLYSIN(R) in late-stage
<br>
cancer patients who have failed all other treatment options. None
<br>
of the patients to date have experienced any serious adverse
<br>
events related to the virus nor were there any dose limiting
<br>
toxicities detected in any patient. As secondary endpoints,
<br>
Oncolytics measured tumour response at both the treated lesion as
<br>
well as remote metastatic sites. Evidence of viral activity in
<br>
tumours was observed, which ranged from changes in tumour
<br>
structure to partial and complete tumour regression in the
<br>
injected tumours. 50% of injected tumours in the first four of
<br>
six groups (twelve of the eighteen patients) demonstrated
<br>
evidence of viral activity. Preliminary evidence of remote tumour
<br>
responses were also noted inthe first four groups.
<br>
&quot;This positive data rewards the tremendous effort of everyone
<br>
involved,&quot; said Dr. Brad Thompson, President and CEO of
<br>
Oncolytics. &quot;Oncolytics is now in a position to initiate multiple
<br>
follow up trials of REOLYSIN(R) to better determine its efficacy
<br>
and safety profile. The first of these studies, a T2 prostate
<br>
cancer trial, is expected to initiate enrollment in January of
<br>
2002.
<br>
&nbsp;Other clinical trial protocols are being prepared. We are
<br>
pleased that there appeared to be no safety issues with the
<br>
administration of REOLYSIN(R) intratumourally, and with the
<br>
treated lesion activity that has been observed to date.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phase I study enrolled a total of 18 patients in six
<br>
groups of three patients each and examined intratumoural (into
<br>
the tumour) administration of REOLYSIN(R). The patients had a
<br>
variety of primary cancers including breast, head and neck,
<br>
melanoma, non-AIDS Kaposi's sarcoma, and others. REOLYSIN(R)was
<br>
administered directly into a subcutaneous (underneath the skin)
<br>
tumour.
<br>
&nbsp;None of the patients were screened for RAS activation of their
<br>
tumours before entry into the trial.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each group received increasing dosages of the virus. Dosages
<br>
examined included single injections of 10(7), 10(8), 10(9), and
<br>
10(10) PFU (plaque forming units, a measure of live virus
<br>
particles), and multiple injections of 10(8) and 10(9) PFU. The
<br>
maximum dose tested in the trial was a single injection of 10(10)
<br>
PFU (virus particles). Both 10(8) PFU groups and the multiple
<br>
10(9) PFU group were added to the original study design when
<br>
tumour activity was noted in the 10(7) PFU group, which was
<br>
unexpected during the design of the study. Oncolytics had
<br>
originally anticipated conducting groups at greater dosages using
<br>
multiple injections of 10(10) PFU but Oncolytics determined that
<br>
it would not provide any more useful information for the future
<br>
development of REOLYSIN(R).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detailed final results of this study are expected to be
<br>
presented next year at an international cancer conference, and
<br>
will include final safety, efficacy, and immune data on all the
<br>
patients.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Oncolytics Biotech Inc.... (Standard disclaimer about
<br>
forward looking statemennts etc omitted.)
<br>
<p>The Phase I Clinical Trial structure has been designed to test 18
<br>
patients (from injection through follow-up) in accordance with
<br>
the established protocol (an &quot;evaluable patient&quot;).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The Trial is designed to follow 6 cohorts with 3 evaluable
<br>
patients in each cohort.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Cohort #1 receives one injection at the lowest established
<br>
dosage.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Cohorts #2 and #3 both receive single injections with cohort #2
<br>
receiving a higher dosage than cohort #1 but less than cohort #3.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Cohorts #4 through #6 receive multiple injections at the maximum
<br>
dosage, with cohort #6 receiving the maximum number of injections
<br>
at the maximum dosage.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The Trial has also been designed to provide the maximum
<br>
protection to the patients involved.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Patient #1 in cohort #1 receives 1 injection and the safety
<br>
results from this patient are assessed after being monitored for
<br>
2 to 3 weeks. Patient #2 of cohort #1 receives their injection
<br>
once the patient #1 assessment indicates progression to the next
<br>
patient is appropriate. This procedure is expected to continue
<br>
through the first two cohorts. Once these cohorts are completed
<br>
and show no significant safety concerns, the subsequent cohorts
<br>
are expected to receive their injections concurrently.
