</em><br>
<p>No. PV, even in multi layer/ multi spectrum cells, peaks out at about
<br>
35% efficiency. Thermal systems can be 80-90% efficient. This is
<br>
efficiency in terms of energy conversion. 
<br>
<p>After that, you need to consider energy density efficiency: If your PV
<br>
system weighs 100kg and your thermal system weighs 300 kg, where both
<br>
receive the same amount of flux but have different conversion
<br>
efficiencies, the PV system is more efficient to launch with, since you
<br>
can produce 15-25% more power for the same amount of weight. If,
<br>
instead, you have a 200 kg thermal system to receive the same power, it
<br>
is the more efficient choice.
<br>
<p>So, there, you are dealing with launch cost efficiency. Then you also
<br>
have to consider maintenance and reliability. Generally, the rule is
<br>
that the fewer moving parts, the more reliable and therefore the least
<br>
cost in terms of maintenance. Since PV has no moving parts, it would
<br>
seem to be the most reliable, while thermal systems generally require at
<br>
least a turbine generator and a pump or two to function. This is fine if
<br>
the actual MTBF is longer than the amount of time you expect between
<br>
opportunities for maintenance inspections. This is not so great for a
<br>
device which is not expected to return to human hands any time in
<br>
decades.
<br>
<p>As you can see, there are a lot of factors to consider.
