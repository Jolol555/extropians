<em>&gt; &gt; Your comments were taken seriously, perhaps people shouldn't have

<p><p>As far as I'm concerned, I understand it, and I do not fly into rage.
<br>
But I note that, in the circa 200 messages you posted these last 2
<br>
months (which coincides with my presence here), you stated your point
<br>
of view on this topic a very large number of times almost unchanged,
<br>
and I can't understand why.
<br>
<p>I think all list members got it, whether they agree or not.
<br>
<p>I understand the importance you attach to it, but as important as it
<br>
is, I don't think you will convince people who do not agree with you
<br>
by massive repetition ; it will only raise their irritation.
<br>
<p>It is not &quot;the last who talks wins the argument&quot;, and one should not,
<br>
based on such principle, repeat the same thing until the opponent gets
<br>
silent... How is the resulting &quot;repetition flood&quot; respectful to the
<br>
list members ?
<br>
<p>Of course this apply to John equally, whatever I think of your two
<br>
points of view. (In fact I broadly agree with John, and very partially
<br>
with you. But that's incidental. I gave up contradicting you 2 months
<br>
ago, leaving you the last word, on the very same topic !
