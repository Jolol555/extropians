<p>
Lee,
<br>
<p>I have to work tonight, but thanks for your reply.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The mind [x] is housed in the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course; I'm arguing against empiricism, not materialism.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The evolution of the brain is directly connected to sensory input
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and output.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hmm.  That one's not as obvious.  There's also the Baldwin effect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think about.
</em><br>
<p>It seems that discovering flexible systems than inflexible ones pushes
<br>
evolution forward, but inflexible systems cause us to stop and ponder.
<br>
Popper thought learning was best achieved from making mistakes.  If an
<br>
animal makes a mistake and tries again and again,  it would become more
<br>
flexible. 
<br>
<p>Why I mentioned the brain: The brain evolved because it needed to survive.
<br>
In order to survive it developed more and different sense capabilities for
<br>
communication.  The brain grew from Reptilian model to mammalian model to
<br>
the frontal lobe attachment (cliff notes version.)  The evolution needed,
<br>
required, and developed more and advanced senses.  We are still advancing
<br>
our senses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Let's not disregard Popper.  I'm not sure if there aren't a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; strata on which to view this subject.  Give some discussion examples of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; newly formed concepts in the mind that have no realtionship to any aspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; whatsoever of sensory stimuli.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Haven't you ever had the experience of not being able to find the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words to describe an idea?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but often it is due to a faulty memory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The existence of that experience makes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear that strict Whorfianism is untenable: ideas don't come from words
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(which come from sounds and visual images).  Ideas preceed words, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are created to expres them.  That doesn't rule out the new ideas being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;visual or auditory, etc.; so we have to dig a little deeper.  But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does show that concepts like &quot;invisible&quot;, &quot;silent&quot;, and &quot;non-existent&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are not necessarily formed from the experience of hearing or seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words.  Can't a blind physicist argue rationally about sight?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, she can gathering information about sight using braille or by
<br>
listening to others opinions of the experience of sight, and/or by being
<br>
told what an object looks like and using metaphor, perhaps, to gain a
<br>
similar or parallel experience through sound or taste or touch.  (Angry
<br>
voice is like a loud noise,rough surface, or bitter taste.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you suppose a mathematician does when he generalizes a formula?  Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he necessarily visualize the formula in some way first, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substitute the image of a variable for a constant?  Of does he first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think the concepts (not the words) &quot;generalize that 3&quot;, and then perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;later conjure up an image and a variable name to help him remember?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the built-in concepts an infant has, like &quot;animated&quot;, before he can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ever experience them?  Can we not conjecture about extraterrestrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life without visualizing any particular form or place?
</em><br>
<p>Here is my thought:  It seems that there is a &quot;current non-sensory&quot; (Max
<br>
More phrase which he and I agreed upon works for us when aruging this topic
<br>
today) experience that helps to explain the state a person experiences when
<br>
he or she does not rely on past sense input vs a current (immediate)
<br>
conjecture/experience .  A mathematician can conjure up a formula in her
<br>
head in a present/current experience.  However, her ability to
<br>
experience/conjure it is based upon her *past* experience of knowing what
<br>
the formula looks like.  We can conjecture ideas, but usually they are
<br>
based on past information.  We can conjure ideas in the current without
<br>
sensory input, although it seems that the conjectures stem from past
<br>
sensory experience.
<br>
<p>If a person is born without vision, audition, the sense of touch or feel,
<br>
an inability to smell, or to experience balance, that person resides in a
<br>
void with only the innate mental programming and the functioning of brain
<br>
waves.  He cannot hear the outside world, see it, taste it, touch it, feel
<br>
it or perceive it through balance.  What type of experiences does this
<br>
person have?
