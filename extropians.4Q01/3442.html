dont' you seem to understand?

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, they do find them disturbing. The only scenario where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorists win is if those who find them disturbing join the terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in fighting against the government over this issue. It is a proven fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that standard revolutionary insurgency doctrine does not work if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sufficient majority of the population trusts the government enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allow it to engage in temporary, targeted, forms of repression that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifically focused on the sources of insurgency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, just sit back and read what you are saying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;temporary, targeted, forms of repression that are specifically focused&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is all well and good in a perfect society.
</em><br>
<p>It is obviously the responsibility of the citizenry to see that it is
<br>
so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But no such thing exists. So, are you going to trust *your* government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to carry out such acts? In secret? I certainly wouldn't.
</em><br>
<p>Are you claiming that our government is at all good at keeping secrets?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We see this occuring in the wake of 911 where you get 80%+ support from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the african-american community for the profiling of arab/muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals by law enforcement. So long as this sort of repression is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not broad based: i.e. profiling african americans as well, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; population will support the government actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is that Quote from Pastor Niemoller (I am writing this offline so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't do a search) about &quot;first they came for the communists, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't worried, I'm not a communist, then they came for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialists...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a really slippery slope which I don't think any government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should even consider entering into. The only time such actions would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified would be during an actual war, or an actual insurgency, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States certainly does not have at the moment. As it is, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of repression would almost certainly breed the sort of resentment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which *creates* insurgencies.
</em><br>
<p>The advantage that our system has over others is that we, the citizens,
<br>
are so well armed. When they come for me, I will be taking a good number
<br>
of them with me, as will many other law abiding citizens. Assuming I
<br>
don't get them first.
<br>
<p>Focusing the repression, as light as it is, squarely on the muslim
<br>
community where it belongs, and how very limited the repression is (I
<br>
don't for instance, see any camps, no pogroms, nothing of the sort)
<br>
should make them consider where exactly the muslim community is wrong.
<br>
Specifically it is in the widespread acceptance of the excuses and lies
<br>
of writers like Edward Said that allows for the propaganda of people
<br>
like bin Laden to propagate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In insurgency doctrine, the point of triggering massive government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; repression with atrocities is to get the government to oppress enough of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the population to feed a large growth in participation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anti-government activities, which leads to more atrocities by terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and more repression by government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But at this point in time there is, as far as I am aware *no* active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurgency underway in the US, and so this totally over-the-top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation you are describing is irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, lets see: US owned airliners taking off from US airports hijacked
<br>
over US airspace and flown into US buildings by hijackers who have lived
<br>
here for years and received their training here, one of whome was
<br>
actually a naturalized US citizen. If that doesn't fit the definition of
<br>
&quot;active insurgency underway in the US&quot;, I don't know what does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The problem in this calculus of force is in predicting the balance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between the public perceptions about the atrocities committed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorists and the proportionality or weightedness of the response by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government. If the government's repression following the atrocity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen as less severe than the atrocity itself, public support remains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the government. A revolutionary needs the government to overreact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and for media sources to widely sensationalize any overreaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure. But if the government is going around oppressing an entire class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people, eventually you will alienate those people, as a group, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then your insurgency will begin. It just breeds itself.
</em><br>
<p>Possibly, but every muslim american, and resident alien muslim here
<br>
already is given the choice: are you a muslim radical first, or an
<br>
American?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For this reason, I look at the anthrax attacks with a suspicious view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, not to mention the possibility of it being other people than those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who did the September 11 attack.
</em><br>
<p>Which is what I was saying. However, if, say, the Iraqis are involved,
<br>
they are essentially the same people, since Ramzi Youssef is an Iraqi
<br>
intelligence operative who was instrumental in bin Ladens original
<br>
attack on the WTC in 1993.
<br>
<p>My implication here is that some individual, possibly who had operated
<br>
as a weapons inspector in Iraq in the early 90's or who was in the
<br>
military in the Gulf War, got ahold of some Iraqi anthrax and brought it
<br>
into the country years ago. This person may or may not be a US
<br>
government operative, and may or may not be acting under orders.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; By targeting members of the media, especially those who have records of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sensationalism and/or sentiment toward left wing anti-government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opinions, the media has specifically been turned into a tool of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sensationalism against government into one of its biggest supporters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and thus they tend to downplay any repression the government does engage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in, since in their own biased editorial view, it is at least partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; justified, if not fully justified.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I guess it is hard to be objective when your life is at stake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did they target members of the media who have such a background? Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being an American, I know very little about US media, other than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that CNN seems to be awash in Australian presenters, unless they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employ regional presenters. I've been highly amused by various US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conspiracy nuts sounding off at all of the &quot;British&quot; accents on CNN,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smelling a plot. (We're after your ski fields. Ours suck).
</em><br>
<p>Tom Brokaw has been a thorn in the side of hawks in the government since
<br>
the Vietnam War, where he was a reporter. The New York Times is the
<br>
bastion of antiwar left wingism/peacenikery. The tabloid company in
<br>
Florida can be trusted to hype, sensationalize, and basically beat to
<br>
death any story its editors want to focus on, and they are not
<br>
restrained by lack of facts.
<br>
<p>As for CNN, its a fact that Ted Turner is a big proponent of One World
<br>
Government, as many interviews dating back to the 1970's can attest.
<br>
He's the guy who gave $1 billion to the UN in an attempt to save his
<br>
marriage to Jane Fonda. CNN has been caught issuing a memo to its staff
<br>
that no positive coverage of the pro-gun-rights point of view, or
<br>
positive coverage of the use of guns in self defense is to be made.
<br>
<p>Outside of that, I think its just a matter of CNN wanting to be seen as
<br>
'international', both by non-Americans as well as the latte lefties who
<br>
live off of being 'sophisticated'. Rupert Murdoch, owner of Fox News,
<br>
being a foreigner, obviously wants to be seen as more American than CNN,
<br>
so he hires all American anchors.
