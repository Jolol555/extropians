<p><em>&gt; I thought the following claim by Schwartz was astonishing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : The same influences are brought to bear throughout the 10-million-strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : Muslim community in America, as well as those in Europe. In the US, 80
</em><br>
per
<br>
<em>&gt; : cent of mosques are estimated by the Sufi Hisham al-Kabbani, born in
</em><br>
Lebanon
<br>
<em>&gt; : and now living in the US, to be under the control of Wahhabi imams, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; : preach extremism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If 80% of United States mosques are Wahhabi, this is not a movement which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is remote and foreign.  We can learn more about it just by visiting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local mosque or Moslem cultural center.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There have been a number of ecumenical gatherings meant to bring together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people from different cultures, Arab Americans and local Muslims along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with mainstream Jews and Christians.  I would love to attend one of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ask the question about the influence of Wahhab.  Is it true that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this movement is synonymous with violent anti-Americanism, as Schwartz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes it out to be?  Why would Muslims living in the United States,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of whom are middle class or above and who aren't grubbing a living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the mean streets of Cairo, find such a religious movement attractive?
</em><br>
<p>They don't neccessarily. It is true that the great majority of the mosques
<br>
are Wahabi (or a closely related movement such as Deobandi). That doesn't
<br>
mean the majority of the people who go to the mosques espouse such views. As
<br>
to why Wahabism has become so influential, there's a simple answer - money.
<br>
Saudi money to be precise. The Saudis subsidise sympathetic mosques and
<br>
maulvis massively which gives them a big advantage. Steve D.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me, this doesn't add up.  I don't know how credible Schwartz is on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this issue (again, a problem with reposting material from elsewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without analysis or comment).  Either Wahhabism is not as closely tied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to violence as is claimed, or it is not so widespread in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The alternative is that 80% of U.S. mosques are fifth columns where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists hide waiting for their chance to strike, which is absurd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal
</em><br>
<p>The correct relation between Wahabism and violence is this: Most Wahabis are
<br>
not violent -but-virtually all violent Muslims are Wahabis. i don't know how
<br>
close to correct 80% is but I'm confident the figure is over 50%. That does
<br>
not mean 80% or what ever of U.S. muslims are fifth columnists but that
<br>
there is a minorty who are. Typically young, male, unmarried and fairly well
<br>
educated, probably in the sciences. SD
