From: &quot;Mike Lorrey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;019001c18a49$075f0d00$345d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">mlorrey@datamann.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; Given that over most of the past decade, white males
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HAVE been 'the enemy' as far as those in power were concerned, then it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an inaccurate point.
</em><br>
<p>Precisely so! ...and it's been more than the past decade... More like the past
<br>
half century.
<br>
For example, read Valerie Solanis' _SCUM Manifesto_ which is still available
<br>
in print and in electronic format. The vilification of white males (aka,
<br>
misandry) makes the detention of Arab/Muslim terrorist suspects look quite
<br>
benign in comparison. For every white female in US prisons, there are twenty
<br>
white men in US prisons. Of course, this is due to genetic sex differences
<br>
which account for behavioral differences, but notice that feminazis deny sex
<br>
differences when it comes to putting females in postitions of leadership. I
<br>
think the war against white males has been motivated largely by jealousy and
<br>
envy... the same thing that motivated the 9-11 terrorists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The crime about the Japanese detention during WWII was not so much that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were detained, but that their private property was seized, stolen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and auctioned off by the state without compensation. There was the issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of detaining natural born citizens who were children of Japanese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immigrants. Under the Geneva Conventions, detention of foreign nationals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is entirely legal, provided they are treated humanely and their property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is respected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What bugs me is that those who harp on things like our detention of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Japanese have absolutely nothing to day about how the Japanese treated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OUR citizens (and those of Britain, Australia, etc) who were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-combatants within Japanese control. They property was confiscated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stolen, or destroyed, and they more often than not died in detention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from torture or maltreatment, yet you never see any of these whining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberals ever protesting outside the Japanese Embassy anywhere demanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reparations for families and survivors of their mistreatment of western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilians during the war. The Japanase government has never apologized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this treatment, generally denies that it took place in their history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books, and has never paid a dime to the survivors or their families, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our government prevents our citizens from suing the Japanese over this.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for pointing out these facts.
