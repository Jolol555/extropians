</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Is it really?  While I've heard the claim that the Palestinians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are being offered sweetheart deals from Israel I've also heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conflicting claims that Israel isn't really giving up very much. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The most recent number I heard is that Israel currently controls
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over 70% of the original Palestine/Israel territory, when they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supposed to only control 50%.  Areas like the Golan Heights are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supposed to be part of Palestine, but are so overly occupied by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imported Ukranians that Israel refuses to give them up.
</em><br>
<p>The Palestinians ought to count themselves damm lucky to get
<br>
anything at all.
<br>
<p>They declared war and attacked their neighbors trying to wipe them
<br>
off the planet, and instead they get their ass kicked and lost
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p>They ought to consider themselves lucky to get anything back.
<br>
<p>The Golan heights has always been a problem because of it's
<br>
strategic value, it's high ground overlooking the rest of Israel
<br>
and any military planner can tell you how valuble that is. Every
<br>
attack on Israel has come from there.
<br>
<p>The problem about who's land it is, is the fact that it was Jewish
<br>
land in ancient times before it was Palestinian, it's that old
<br>
argument.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;I don't claim to know everything about the situation, but what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do know smacks of unfairness.  With the Russians out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;picture, why are we supporting that unfairness with our financial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and military might?
</em><br>
<p><p>Israel is a friend and ally, and if the Palestinians ever get
<br>
serious, which means putting a halt to terrorism, them I'm sure
<br>
they will come to terms.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Both Jordan and Syria occupy former Palestinian land and isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it funny that you never hear boo about it?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Where Jordanian and Syrian governments are in control of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;territory, Muslims aren't treated as second-class citizens.  From
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what I know, Jews in Israel actually have extra constitutional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights and protections. Palestinians can freely enter and leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jordan and Syria, but in Israel they have to obtain special papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and permits.  To me, it's no surprise that Palestinians consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Israel to be the greatest threat in all this.
</em><br>
<p><p>Israel is Israel and Palestinians are foreigners. They couldn't
<br>
walk around America or anywhere else without passports. Plus they
<br>
are still in a state of war because of terrorism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Don't get me wrong, I'd like to see this set right, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Palestinians are every bit as much at fault, if not more so, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than the Israelis.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;See, that's where I'm not so sure.  With our media and government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so much under the influence of Jewish media moguls, have we as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Americans been getting a reasonably objective view of the events
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Israel and the Middle East?  From my conversations with friends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outside of the US media-sphere, I get the feeling that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Palestinians are much less at fault than we've been lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe.
</em><br>
<p>I get my facts from a wide variety of sources. But lets put it to
<br>
a simple test. 
<br>
<p>You are the leader of a country, your next door neighbor colludes
<br>
with other neighbors and attacks you. Thousands of your citizens
<br>
are killed. You successfully drive off the invaders and at the end
<br>
you are sitting on what was formerly your neighbors land. Do you
<br>
simply forget the whole thing and give it back?
<br>
<p>The second time?
<br>
<p>The third time?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; So what right to we have to go around kicking in governments?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Straw man.  Who said anything about &quot;kicking in governments&quot;?  I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just like us to get out of the whole area.  Leave Saudi Arabia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Kuwait. Let those governments stabilize and defend themselves.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they want help in creating secular democracies, then it's probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worth it for us to give them a hand.  Currently, though, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand why we're supporting the countries that we are.
</em><br>
<p><p>Okay I see what you're saying. Mostly we're supporting these
<br>
countries because the alternative is worse.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Liberals always want to have things both ways.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Oh, man.  I certainly hope that you're not calling me a liberal. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Them's fightin' words.  I'd characterize myself as a libertarian,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or at worst an atheistic conservative.
</em><br>
<p><p>Nah, name calling is against list rules. ;)
<br>
<p>It was an offhanded remark about liberals in general.
<br>
<p>Everytime I take some political test I get labeled a liberal, but
<br>
what I am and what people who call themselves liberals are is
<br>
usually completely different.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The Cold War is over.  This support of the &quot;lesser of evils&quot; no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; longer makes the sense that it did a couple of decades ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Which is better, a corrupt government or a fundamentalist one?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Who knows?  In this case, the corrupt one was more predisposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us because of our past intervention on their behalf, and because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they know that our continued support is required for them to stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in power.  Then again, our occupation of Saudi Arabia is one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the prime reasons why we just lost over 6,000 people and billions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of dollars.  Maybe supporting the fundamentalist one would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been cheaper.
</em><br>
<p>Occupying Saudi Arabia? 
<br>
<p>We have troops there at the request of the Royal family on some
<br>
bases nothing more. Hardly qualifys as an occupation. The Saudi's
<br>
could ask us to leave tomorrow.
<br>
<p>We lost 6000 people because a religious fanatic has been fighting
<br>
a declared war against us for years and our government stupidly
<br>
ignored it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;We should just get the hell out of the support business for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;governments that are fundamentalist, corrupt, or both.
</em><br>
<p>I still support the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; argument.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Of course we are.  They've gotten filthy rich selling us oil at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collusion-obtained prices (OPEC), yet when they have trouble with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their neighbors, we take care of it for them.  A lot of good it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did for our oil prices this past summer when they went along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all of the other OPEC nations in reducing production.
</em><br>
<p>OPEC isn't the only player in town, and supply and demand set the
<br>
price. We can always lessen our dependence. I can see why Kuwait
<br>
would have political reasons to remain on good terms with it's OPEC
<br>
partners.
<br>
<p>Good discussion.
