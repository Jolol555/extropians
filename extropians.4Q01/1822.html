defacto censorship because I cannot afford the legal fees of

constantly defending myself against legal harrassment). When Dmitri

<p><em>&gt; The 4th? Considering an artist who never makes any money because his art

</em><br>
<p>Please, Mike, don't undermine your credibility with melodrama. Nobody
<br>
in America smart/interesting enough to have millions of fans, grateful
<br>
or not, will ever in a homeless shelter with foodstamps and government
<br>
cheese, much less starve. This kind of statement might goad Samantha
<br>
into insulting you, but I will not stoop to that level. Let's continue
<br>
this dialogue as adults interested in freedom and progress, shall we?
<br>
<p>4th:
<br>
&quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
<br>
papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall
<br>
not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
<br>
supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the
<br>
place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now how are you going to bust somebody for intellectual property
<br>
violations without either a) sniffing their packets or b) siezing and
<br>
searching their computer?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 5th? dont' see it
</em><br>
<p>It's right after the 4th. Due process, self incrimination, etc. I
<br>
admit, I'd need to do more research before I could cite specific ways
<br>
current copyright legislation infringes on this one, so I withdraw it
<br>
for now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 10th? that is states rights.
</em><br>
<p>More than states rights. Peoples rights too.
<br>
&quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
<br>
nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states
<br>
respectively, or to the people.&quot;
<br>
<p>This essentially sanctifies the principle that everything not expressly
<br>
prohibited by law is permitted, and any authority that is not expressly
<br>
given a power is denied that power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An amendment does not eliminate something written into the body of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Constitution unless it specifically says it does. One could say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual property rights, because they exist within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitution, are the 0th Amendment rights.
</em><br>
<p>Section 8, clause 8.
<br>
[The Congress shall have the power] &quot;To promote the progress of
<br>
science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and
<br>
inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and
<br>
discoveries; &quot;
<br>
<p>I'm arguing that because of shoddy lawmaking, ignorance, and
<br>
technological changes, most of modern copyright law no longer promotes
<br>
the progress of science and useful arts, and instead hinders it. To
<br>
hear some economic luddites today, &quot;Beat It&quot; is Michael Jackson's
<br>
property that he is entitled to defend to the death just as if it was
<br>
his car or his home. Constitution 8:8 is actually must less vehement
<br>
in this regard, than said economic luddites... and it was written by
<br>
people who were anything but soft where it came to real property
<br>
rights! It can be interpreted that intellectual property is not a
<br>
natural right the way the right to rival, excludable goods and the
<br>
right to protection from unreasonable search and seizure are. Rather,
<br>
the Constitution gives the legislature power to mandate limited
<br>
recognition of intellectual works. Furthermore, note that it says
<br>
nothing about PROMOTERS of writings and discoveries. Only the authors
<br>
and inventors themselves. So the publishers and estates that control
<br>
the rights to so many intellectual works today, and are the source of
<br>
the most legal harrassment, have no Constitutional basis for their
<br>
claims.
<br>
<p>At any right, supposing that according to the Constitution, I can be
<br>
prosecuted for pirating Michael Jackson's songs. But according to the
<br>
Constitution, I may not be submitted to search and siezure without
<br>
probable cause and due process, and my speach may not be censored. If
<br>
the only way to catch me pirating is by search and siezure without
<br>
probable cause (since I blend right into the non-pirate population)
<br>
and, if what I choose to say are instructions on how to be a l337
<br>
p1r4t3 d00d and/or the lyrics to &quot;Beat It&quot;, then it appears that we've
<br>
got ourselves a Constitutional contradiction. Darn, and here I was
<br>
thinking only religious documents contradict themselves.
<br>
<p>So, what happens when an ammendment turns out to contradict something
<br>
written into the body of the Constitution, just not specifically?
<br>
Greg?
<br>
<p>My gut reaction is to apply a legal Occam's Razor to this-- how many
<br>
layers of legislation come between each of the following claims and
<br>
the Constitution:
<br>
<p>&quot;I have a right to inspect your computer, sniff your network
<br>
connection, and have you arrested if you provide information that will
<br>
help other people pirate the intellectual work that I own the
<br>
distribution rights to.&quot;
<br>
<p>vs.
<br>
<p>&quot;I have a right to not have my computer or network connection tampered
<br>
with unless there is a solid reason to believe I am a criminal, and I
<br>
likewise have a right to say anything I want as long as I don't follow
<br>
up my words with physical actions or yell 'movie' in a crowded
<br>
firetheater&quot;
<br>
<p>- -- 
<br>
* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
<br>
* honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
<br>
* and its Jihad.&quot;                                                   *
