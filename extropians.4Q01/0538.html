I do not believe there has been any &quot;proof&quot; that a quantum computer
<br>
can function as a Turing machine and can therefore function as
<br>
any computer.
<br>
<p>There are certain computations, such as factoring, that have been
<br>
mapped into quantum algorithms which can therefore be solved using
<br>
a quantum computer.  So a quantum computer, to the extent that I
<br>
understand them, can only be used to solve a limited subset of
<br>
the phase space of what is computable.
<br>
<p>So I do not believe a comparison between the brain as a neural
<br>
network and a quantum computer is a useful comparison.  As I've
<br>
discussed in my Matrioshka Brain papers, you are going to get
<br>
a factor of 10^5 increase by going to reversible rod-logic, which
<br>
combined with a volume reduction of 10^3 gets you at least 10^8
<br>
improvement in throughput (probably more if you allow for the fact that
<br>
you can move from ion-current signal propagation delays to speed-of-sound
<br>
in diamond for nearby processors to speed-of-light for distant
<br>
processors).  Going to helical-logic gets you a factor of &gt;10^11
<br>
and if you can get ballistic heat removal (which is starting to
<br>
look possible given recent buckytube simulations), another factor
<br>
of 10^9 or so.
<br>
<p>So in terms of throughput, I'd guess the limits are &gt; 10^20 increase
<br>
without having to move us to qubits or sub-atomic engineering.
<br>
Of course discussions regarding throughput per unit of real time
<br>
get rather valueless once one has uploaded since you are then
<br>
living until the heat death of the universe.
<br>
<p>Now of course, a nano-brain with a qubit add-on subprocessor
<br>
would of course be useful, particularly if your job is gathering
<br>
intelligence information.  :-;
<br>
<p>One thing that remains to be determined is the degree to which
<br>
the brain is &quot;packing bits&quot;.  It looks like the neurons may
<br>
be moderately sensitive to the timing of the firing of neuronal
<br>
pulses -- if so, there is more going on than you can account
<br>
for by simply counting neurons.  Also important is the fact
<br>
that the brain is *not* primarily a computation engine --
<br>
its much more of a communication engine.  Each of the 40
<br>
billion neurons can have inputs &amp; outputs ranging from 10^3-10^5.
<br>
And there are rumblings in the neuroscience community that the
<br>
glial cells are doing more than providing &quot;nutritional&quot; support.
<br>
<p>Unraveling the whole system is going to be a nightmare and I'm
<br>
very glad that people like Anders and Eliezer are the ones
<br>
wrestling with it and not me.
<br>
