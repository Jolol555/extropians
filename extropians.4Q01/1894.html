</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself... and others... she's made a deliberate study of rationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look to your own mental integrity, not to hers.
</em><br>
<p>If she has, she surely has not displayed it. In her latest 'asshole'
<br>
post (I was not aware that frequent use of that word was a sign of a
<br>
rational person), she directly ignored my point, as she has in most of
<br>
my other posts, primarly, it seems, because she has absolutely no
<br>
rational basis to oppose my arguments in those instances but was too
<br>
arrogant to admit it. 
<br>
<p>She may be a great programmer and may be technically astute. However,
<br>
when it comes to politics, she seems to have a far harder time
<br>
abandoning her anti-American political agenda than I have had resisting
<br>
the old 'young republican' memes with my newer libertarian ones.
<br>
<p>I admit I pull no punches in my arguments. I frequently have no desire
<br>
to 'feel someone elses pain'.
<br>
<p>Samantha and others claim that the US needs to start listening to the
<br>
rest of the world, and shaping its policy more in line with the way the
<br>
rest of the world thinks it should be. Since Samantha opened the
<br>
argument to profanity, I shall continue it with a hearty &quot;fuck that&quot;.
<br>
<p>The US did not get where it is today as the preeminent economic,
<br>
military, and cultural power in the world, while concurrently having the
<br>
most free society on earth, by doing things the way others thought we
<br>
should do them. We did it OUR way, the way we knew in our hearts to be
<br>
best, not just for us, but for the world, and as a result, the world has
<br>
gotten through the age of nuclear brinksmanship in far better shape than
<br>
I'll bet would have occured if any other power had been in our place.
<br>
Ideas like individual liberty and democratic/republican values are the
<br>
pre-eminent ideas in politics around the world today specifically
<br>
because of us. This didn't happen by us letting others tell us how
<br>
things should be.
<br>
<p>Those around the world who want to start telling us how things should be
<br>
done do so specifically because their own power is threatened by our
<br>
principles and influence. They are supporting terrorism specifically
<br>
because it is the best technique designed to date for getting large
<br>
masses of civilians to question their principles, at a cost that is
<br>
smaller than most any other.
<br>
<p>At the very least, those who want to tell us what to do do so because
<br>
they are reacting against the growing influence of American culture
<br>
around the world. Whether it is fast food, movies, books, or the
<br>
influence of science and technology, the rest of the world is being
<br>
bootstrapped at a far faster rate than we have experienced here in the
<br>
US, and larger percents of the populations in those countries are
<br>
reacting against such bootstrapping.
<br>
<p>If you think the luddite movement is bad here in the US and Britain, it
<br>
is far worse elsewhere, especially in those societies with a far greater
<br>
history of authoritarian societies, governments, and culture,
<br>
specifically because technology and American culture in general is a
<br>
force for the liberation of the individual from not just government
<br>
controls, but social, religious, cultural and memetic controls.
<br>
<p>It is only to be expected that the memetic constructs of foreign
<br>
cultures are acting to actively resist the memes American culture is
<br>
putting out, and they are targeting technology and other networking
<br>
mechanisms that penetrate barriers to entry easily.
