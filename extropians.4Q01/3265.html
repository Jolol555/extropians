<p>Firm says it created human embryo through cloning
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON (CNN) --In a move certain to raise new questions of science
<br>
and ethics, doctors have created human embryos through cloning, scientists
<br>
announced Sunday.
<br>
<p>The cloning was performed by Advanced Cell Technology Inc. of Worcester,
<br>
Massachusetts. The company said the experiment was aimed not at creating
<br>
a human being but at mining the embryo for stem cells used to treat disease,
<br>
Reuters reported. Stem cells are a kind of master cell that can grow
<br>
into any kind of cell in
<br>
the body.
<br>
<p>&quot;We've taken the first hulking steps toward what we think is going to
<br>
be a new area of medicine,&quot; said Dr. Michael West, the company's president
<br>
and CEO. &quot;It's been called regenerative medicine.&quot;
<br>
<p>Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, West disputed the suggestion that the
<br>
work amounted to the creation of human life.
<br>
<p>&quot;Biologically, scientifically, the entities we're creating are not an
<br>
individual,&quot; West said. &quot;They're only cellular life. They're not a human
<br>
life.&quot;
<br>
<p>West said the breakthrough could lead to advances in fighting a variety
<br>
of ailments, including Parkinson's disease and diabetes.
<br>
<p>Exciting? Or troubling?
<br>
<p>The news drew immediate criticism from some lawmakers.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think that people are concerned about the ethical problems here,&quot;
<br>
said Sen. Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama. He said he expected
<br>
lawmakers would soon take up the issue.
<br>
<p>&quot;I believe it will be a big debate, but at end of day I don't believe
<br>
we'll let cloning of human embryos,&quot; Shelby said.
<br>
<p>&quot;I find it very, very troubling, and I think most of Congress would,&quot;
<br>
said Sen. Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.
<br>
<p>In the study, which was published in the Journal of Regenerative Medicine,
<br>
scientists removed the DNA from human egg cells and replaced it with
<br>
DNA from a human body cell. The egg cells began to develop &quot;to an embryonic
<br>
state,&quot; according to a press release from the company.
<br>
<p>Of the eight eggs, two divided to form early embryos of four cells and
<br>
one progressed to a six-cell stage before it stopped dividing. This breakthrough
<br>
occurred October 13, 2001.
<br>
<p>&quot;These are exciting preliminary developments,&quot; said Robert P. Lanza,
<br>
vice president of medical and scientific development at ACT and an author
<br>
on the paper.
<br>
<p>&quot;This work sets the stage for human therapeutic cloning as a potentially
<br>
limitless source of immune-compatible cells for tissue engineering and
<br>
transplantation medicine. Our intention is not to create cloned human
<br>
beings, but rather to make lifesaving therapies for a wide range of human
<br>
disease conditions including diabetes, strokes, cancer, AIDS and neurodegenerative
<br>
disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.&quot;
<br>
<p>The White House had no immediate reaction to the news, but President
<br>
Bush has previously voiced his opposition to human cloning. This summer,
<br>
the House of Representatives voted to ban human cloning and set penalties
<br>
of up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine for those convicted
<br>
of attempting to clone humans.
<br>
<p>The measure was never taken up by the Senate, so it never became law.
