Michael M. Butler (what does the M. stand for?) posted a note about:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ANCIENT SECRET SYSTEM MOVE MONEY GLOBALLY&quot; by Dogulas Frantz
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/03/international/03LAUN.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/03/international/03LAUN.html</a>
<br>
from the NY Times.
<br>
<p><p>Now *that* article is really useful.  It points out both the need for
<br>
trust between people in societies to effectively function as a collective
<br>
as well as the means by which such trust systems may operate
<br>
outside of the realm of normal legal and observational realms.
<br>
<p>This calls into question &quot;principle 5&quot; of the Extropian principles:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5. Open Society -- Supporting social orders that foster freedom of speech,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom of action, and experimentation. Opposing authoritarian social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control and favoring the rule of law and decentralization of power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Preferring bargaining over battling, and exchange over compulsion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Openness to improvement rather than a static utopia.
</em><br>
<p>The freedom to experiment with speech (as in covert, encrypted, secure
<br>
speech) and action (as in the liberty to setup trust networks independent
<br>
of external observation or monitoring) would seem to be an assault to
<br>
the rights of individuals to guarantee their own personal security
<br>
and autonomy.  [I.e. if *you* or your designated security force
<br>
(presumably a government) *cannot* monitor *and* guarantee the
<br>
trustability of external agents (potentially requiring authoritarian
<br>
measures) then is the &quot;rule of law&quot; worth the paper it is printed
<br>
on and is the &quot;decentralization of power&quot; not fundamentally unextropic?
