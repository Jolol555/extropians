<br>
<p>Welcome to the next generation of remote control, interactive toys - a
<br>
revolution in evolution! Wow Wee's revolutionary B.I.O. (Bio-mechanical
<br>
Integrated Organisms) Bugs are a new breed of artificial intelligence. Nervous
<br>
network technology, developed by Mark Tilden and the US government to create
<br>
living robotic creatures, now allows the B.I.O. Bugs to act without human
<br>
instruction and mimic real insect behavior.
<br>
<p>Programmed to adapt and evolve for survival, you can train your B.I.O. Bug for
<br>
battle with other B.I.O. Bugs. Watch its amazing agility as it roams over any
<br>
terrain - you can control your Bugs or leave them to roam independently and
<br>
discover their new environment! You'll be amazed at how your B.I.O. Bug can
<br>
identify other B.I.O. Bugs and how its touch sensitive antenna guides it
<br>
through and around virtually any environment.
<br>
<p>B.I.O. Bugs react independently to outside stimuli: objects, people, animals,
<br>
and other B.I.O. Bugs. You can also control the Bugs with a wrist transmitter
<br>
that functions as a homing beacon and feeding station. A special command will
<br>
even have your Bug following you around the house! To keep up their strength,
<br>
the Bugs will feed occasionally at their transmitter, and they can snack off
<br>
of any item that emits infrared light.
<br>
<p>The B.I.O. Bugs come in four different configurations, each with its own
<br>
personality. The Blue &quot;Stomper&quot; is the most flexible Bug. He clambers and hops
<br>
over obstacles. The Red &quot;Predator&quot; is the most aggressive of all the Bugs. It
<br>
may even attack its own species! The Green &quot;Destroyer&quot; is a big Bug with a
<br>
supremely defensive exterior. The Yellow &quot;Acceleraider&quot; is the fastest Bug.
<br>
This speedy Bug quickly scampers across surfaces. The longer a B.I.O. Bug
<br>
stays alive, the more it learns from exploration and interaction. Collect all
<br>
four! B.I.O. Bugs measure about 12 inches long.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
