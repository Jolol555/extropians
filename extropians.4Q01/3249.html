</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Britain, 1770-1870 or thereabouts. It's near as dammit the minarchist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state they keep banging on about. No income tax, night-watchman goverment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a navy (the main military force) than ran at a profit (by enforcing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was a roaring success for business -- but it wasn't a very nice place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for ordinary people to live and it sowed the seeds of its own collapse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clue: the pollution was so bad that massive public works had to be created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deal with it (read up on The Great Stink of 1853 if you don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me). Second clue: social conditions were sufficiently bad that *England*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was where Marx expected the communist revolution to break out. Third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clue: the libertarian &quot;utopia&quot; of imperial Britain was dismantled from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inside out by its own people.
</em><br>
<p>I would say that this is what would occur when debt was treated as a
<br>
criminal offense (as was normal during this period) and industry was NOT
<br>
required to pay for it's negative externalities, as would be normal in a
<br>
libertopic economy. Fix those two things and Britain could have made a
<br>
go of it. Furthermore, labor movements are also not anti-libertarian per
<br>
se, so long as they do not use force to monopolize their labor markets.
