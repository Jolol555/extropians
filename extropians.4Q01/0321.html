One final thing: There is absolutely no point in buying said NBC
<br>
equipment if it is going to sit at home in a box. I'm sure plenty of
<br>
list members have read enough SF to understand the first rule of space
<br>
travel: keep your pressure suit with you at all times, you never know
<br>
when a blowout will occur. Same rule applies with chemwarfare: carry
<br>
your gasmask with you in your handbag, backpack, or briefcase at all
<br>
times: in your car, at work, to the gym.
<br>
<p>If you think that is too much of a bother, then don't bother buying a
<br>
mask: keep the demand and prices low by not wasting your time, money,
<br>
and everybody else's resources on something you refuse to be prepared to
<br>
use. 
<br>
<p>Currently in the US, there is little point, still, in buying such
<br>
equipment. Until an enemy demonstrates an ability to sustain repeated
<br>
attacks on civilian US targets, there is little point in investing in
<br>
such equipment for most people. Unless you live in an area that is of
<br>
prime worth for such an attack (immediately near sports arenas, large
<br>
urban centers, or government facilities), the chances of you getting
<br>
attacked specifically are pretty low. If you live outside the DC-Boston
<br>
corridor, your chances are even lower.
