<p><em>    &gt; It's range is 17 miles, at a speed of 8 mph. That is twice the speed of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; a fast walk,
</em><br>
<p>That's a 100% improvement with no effort, pretty good I'd say.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;and not very useful as a commuter vehicle: the average commute today
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;is over 25 miles
</em><br>
<p>It's not a replacement for a car it's a replacement for your feet.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The only concern I have  is that you can already go that fast on some
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;rollerblades in the same  environments
</em><br>
<p>Rollerblading takes skill and time to master, IT is supposed to be effortless,
<br>
and I can't picture my grandmother on rollerblades but I can see her on IT.
<br>
My concern is not the speed or the range, I think that's fine, I'm not even
<br>
too worried about the cost, my concern is the weight, I wish it weighed
<br>
less than 65 pounds.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;and get some exercise as well
</em><br>
<p>You almost make that sound like a good thing. For some reason people
<br>
just won't walk if they can ride, I've seen people drive up and down a
<br>
parking lot for 10 minutes so they can find a place for their car that was
<br>
50 feet closer to the entrance of a gym.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;there are already a number of electric scooters and bikes on the market
</em><br>
<p>But they're not pedestrian friendly, you're not supposed to ride them on
<br>
sidewalks and when people go to church on Sunday they don't ride them
<br>
inside the building. The dream is that all these things will be done with IT.
<br>
We'll see.
