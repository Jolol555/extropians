<em>&gt; &gt; IIRC, when similar religious laws were tried in parts of Europe at
</em><br>
various
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; points in time, I believe the business community created fee structures
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the various services associated with the interest free loan so that
</em><br>
profit
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could be made...

<em>&gt; My knowledge of history is dubious at best, but I think there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a time in Europe where the Christians were forbidden under usury
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws from profitting from loaning capital.  Fortunately they had Jews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living among them who were under no such restrictions.  The Jews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had many restrictions in other areas, such that the structure of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws practically forced them into banking, which turned out to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enormously profitable.  Perhaps someone can fill in the details.  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is broadly right. The Church develops an explicit ban on usury during
<br>
the &quot;medieval reformation&quot; of the 11th/12th centuries (along with a lot of
<br>
other things such as clerical celibacy). Jews were increasingly banned from
<br>
other occupations but could lend money at interest. Two consequences in
<br>
addition to the one Spike gives (a) Jews become even more unpopular and
<br>
favorite scapegoats for Kings facing a spot of bother over high taxes etc
<br>
(b) everyone else wanted to get in on the act, particularly the Italians and
<br>
the Dutch. So ingenious theologians produced arguments that it wasn't
<br>
interest that was banned, only &quot;excessive&quot; interest, and came up with
<br>
elaborate ways of charging for loans without explicitly charging interest
<br>
(what Muslims do today). Although rulers repeatedly pass anti-usury laws
<br>
these are not effectively enforced by the 15th century. BTW Calvin was very
<br>
hostile to interest, as were most of his followers. Steve Davies
