<em>&gt; PS While I agree with jon clark on almost everything factual discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it's abundantly clear that Samantha is *not* an idiot.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there are two distinct ways to use this word &quot;idiot.&quot;
<br>
<p>1 : a person affected with idiocy; especially : a feebleminded person having a
<br>
mental age not exceeding three years and requiring complete custodial care
<br>
2 : a foolish or stupid person
<br>
<p>I think John Clark had used the word in the second sense, in the colloquial
<br>
sense, to mean that although the offender in question may not actually be a
<br>
medically diagnosed and certifiable idiot, nevertheless there was a
<br>
frustrating and recurrent refusal to actually *read* what John Clark had
<br>
written, so that for all intents and purposes, one might conclude that only an
<br>
idiot could fail to learn from the posted messages. Plus, there was a level of
<br>
denial of reality in some of these messages that did connote an obstinacy
<br>
reminiscent of what one might expect from a certifiable idiot. What makes this
<br>
particular debating tactic (i.e., feigned ignorance) so infuriating, is that
<br>
it allows recalcitrant debaters to pretend innocence, after wasting a
<br>
significant amount of everyone's time. So, it's not so much the mental acuity
<br>
of the flame-baiter that justified the ad hominem, but rather the arrogant
<br>
negation of cited facts and figures. Anyway, I think a metaphorical
<br>
interpretation of the term &quot;blithering idiot&quot; quite apropos as it does rather
<br>
well in describing some of the things I read from the offending party. I vote
<br>
for making &quot;blithering idiot&quot; a simile for anyone who obstinately refuses to
<br>
face facts, for whatever reasons, including allegiance to some failed ideology
<br>
(such as socialism).
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
