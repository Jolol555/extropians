<em>&gt; Obviously there will be opposition to such a change by consumers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it will somewhat limit the market for CDs which can be sold in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this format, but the advantages in making them harder to pirate may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be motivation enough for the manufacturers.  If this happens, all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music on Napster and its replacements will be old stuff, and current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hits won't be available.
</em><br>
<p>Only one person needs to successfully rip the CD for it to go everywhere. 
<br>
DVDs are already encrypted.  It has not made a perceptible difference. 
<br>
Setting that aside...
<br>
<p>Free information tends to drive out nonfree information; I no longer need
<br>
to decide whether to register shareware, because there are almost always
<br>
free alternatives.  I don't even see shareware.  I just tell CNET to
<br>
screen out all licenses except &quot;Free&quot;.  Which is the point at which one
<br>
starts wondering about the continued survival of the industry.  If all new
<br>
music can somehow be kept safe, then people will download old music
<br>
instead.  Actually, this might be a stable solution.  There's enough
<br>
existing unprotected music to preserve an economy of abundance for music
<br>
users; those who want the luxury of listening to something published after
<br>
2002 can pay for it.  It's not a perfectly fair solution, and in fact
<br>
contains some pretty blatant unfairnesses, but it might work.  You can't
<br>
tell people to not download, but you might be able to tell them to
<br>
download old information instead of new information.
