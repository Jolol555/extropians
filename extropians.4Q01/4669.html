<p>It depends on which scientists you talk to whether anything out
<br>
of the ordinary has or has not been produced in the lab.  But to
<br>
be honest, I don't remember anything above some effects that
<br>
seemed significantly higher than chance.  And I do consider this
<br>
one of the stronger arguments that there isn't anything to this
<br>
stuff.  After all, no one has stepped forth to claim the Randi
<br>
prize.  And I see no could reason that some highly psychic or
<br>
advanced yogi somewhere would not at least consider it a service
<br>
to humanity to prove to everyone that there was more than just
<br>
what materialism/science has a handle on.  But it hasn't
<br>
happened.  Odd.  Does everyone with such abilities get persuaded
<br>
that it wouldn't be a good idea?  A gang of black magicians
<br>
keeps them from performing?  It does get real suspicious after a
<br>
while to be sure.  Of course, I could simply hold that this Mind
<br>
doesn't allow such mucking about with the local laws of
<br>
physics.  Except of course that would contradict a lot of the
<br>
literature about all of this line of stuff.   So, I will
<br>
certainly grant that the case for doubt is quite strong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Working as a neurologist teaches you to be a skeptic. Even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your Bayesian priors are skewed towards serious belief in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supernaturalism, the daily repetition of experiments giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results compatible with the opposite attitude should lead you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, those are the to-be-expected within this sim after all. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the absence of a verifiable and unequivocal physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manifestation of a God/ancestor spirit/time-travelling Mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. I feel entirely justified in interpreting reports of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supernaturality as evidence of electrical malfunctions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what such a manifestation would look like but
<br>
someone beating the Randi challenge would at least establish
<br>
more firmly that there is something &quot;out there&quot; we don't have
<br>
covered.  
<br>
<p>I can thoroughly understand your position, even if I don't share
<br>
it.
