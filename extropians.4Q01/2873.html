<em>&gt; &gt; building a future that is viable personally.   Meaning well is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no excuse for anyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What can you do with your supra-rationality that I can't do with my plain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old rationality?  I mean, calling some system &quot;supra-rationality&quot; is a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; always easy to prove even if they're true, so I'm not asking for proof.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I'm asking for is suggestive evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Since you have a highly refined rationality that includes many
<br>
things many assume are excluded or questionable, I probably
<br>
can't do a lot mroe with supra-rationality than you can do with
<br>
your &quot;plain old rationality&quot;.  However, I doubt that you could
<br>
totally explain and support all of your normative structures
<br>
using rationality alone.  I frankly can't get much a grip on
<br>
saying more about what I mean by &quot;supra-rational&quot; at the
<br>
moment.  So I will pass on this one for now.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Incidentally, spirituality can also turn off highly talented people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dedicated to creating the future.  Even things that aren't spiritual but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that bear some imagined resemblance to spirituality can turn off highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talented people.  The sometimes irrational reactions of people who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly talented are quite irrelevant to where the truth or falsity lies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least if you're considering the problem as a problem and not as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public relations exercise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if you want to ask &quot;What good are put-downs of active spirituality?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then one is perfectly justified in coming back and saying &quot;What good is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tread on spiritual grounds at all?&quot;  After all, the largest religion in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world is Islam, which still has only 25% of the world population, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything you say is going to tick off at least 75% of the audience.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's worth going there for the sake of the truth, then all that matters in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering a put-down of active spirituality is whether the put-down is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true, not who the put-down offends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The point I was attempting, although inadequately, to make is
<br>
that spirituality is often given a pretty bad rap in these
<br>
parts.  It is not uncommon here for people to make really strong
<br>
assertions that rationality/science/reason is completely and
<br>
totally sufficient for any and all needs of human and higher
<br>
beings now and forever.  Some even claim that spirituality and
<br>
all religion must be seen as diseases and must be purged from
<br>
human society for our own good.  As I myself recognize that many
<br>
of my deepest values and aspirations are not totally defendable,
<br>
derivable or supported by rationality alone, I find such views
<br>
inadequate and doubtful at best and dangerous attempts to close
<br>
off consideration of what I believe are important aspects of the
<br>
problem space prematurely.
