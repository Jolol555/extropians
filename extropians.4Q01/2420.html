<p>### I would perceive his guilt as stemming from his desire to kill. While
<br>
the bombers proved their desire to kill by killing, he proved his desire by
<br>
helping them. This is a sufficient proof for me that he is immoral (=willing

to thwart innocent life-wishes), and therefore may be killed.

 They had a partial choice and
did not make the ethical choice. He largely caused the situation, but
the actual execution was left to ethical subjects.
<p>### But I don't think he really &quot;caused&quot; the situation - he just helped, and
what matters is his provable intention.
<p>----
<p> If that doesn't
appeal to the standard human reaction, that does not have to be a
problem with the ethical perspective. I also wonder if the practice of
putting the blame on the evil planner rather than the people doing
things isn't risky because it seems to absolve the doers too much; maybe
it would be better to show that you do get punished from following
bad orders?
<p>### If orders are immoral, both those who issue them and those who carry out
the orders are to be blamed. The whole chain of command can under certain
circumstances be judged guilty.This approach was taken in the war criminal
trials in Nuremberg.
