<em>&gt;By my standards they are evil, deranged, monomaniacs.  Also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;criminals, but that's objective, not having to do with standards.
</em><br>
<p>Without standards, nothing is a &quot;crime&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;OTOH, they went into an action knowing that it would kill them. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is brave.  Being brave doesn't make it admirable.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remains evil.
</em><br>
<p>Suicide isn't an act of bravery as any psychiatrist can tell you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Bravery isn't an excuse for anything.  But as I have always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heard the term used, it had an objective definition: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Intentionally putting oneself in harm's way as a part of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effort that one engages in to achieve a goal that one deems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worhty.
</em><br>
<p>As anyone who has taken philosophy 101 knows there is no such thing
<br>
as objective, man is the measure.
<br>
<p>These chickenshit cowards thought they were earning eternal rewards
<br>
in an afterlife and the title of heroes in this one. They were
<br>
narcissistic greedy little bastards, along with being cowards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So I've got to consider them brave. And they are still evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deranged madmen.  But that is by subjective criteria.  (I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have any objective criteria for those characteristics.)
</em><br>
<p>Consider them what ever you like.
<br>
<p>The brave and courageous were the men aboard flight 93 and I would
<br>
not have their memory tarnished by refering to their killers as
<br>
anything other than the scum of the earth they were.
