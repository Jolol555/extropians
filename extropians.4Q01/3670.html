<p>Depends on the time of day. Late afternoon -- brick, no question. Late 
<br>
evening -- symphony, or maybe melodic trance.
<br>
<p>Rather than getting into this debate again, I'll just make a meta comment.
<br>
<p>The range of views among transhumanists on the issue of personal identity 
<br>
is wide, yet we cluster more tightly than the general population. I think 
<br>
you could roughly (and with some twisting) array the positions along a 
<br>
spectrum, with probably all of us towards the more permissive end and most 
<br>
people on the more restrictive end.
<br>
<p>IDENTITY THEORISTS
<br>
<p>QUALITY DUALISTS ---- SUSTANCE DUALISTS --- REINCARNATIONISTS
<br>
<p>CONTINUITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS THEORISTS
<br>
<p>FUNCTIONALISTS (A) IDENTICAL COPY IS NOT ME
<br>
<p>FUNCTIONALIST (B) IDENTICAL COPY IS ME  ---  PARFITIANS
<br>
<p>MORAVECIANS
<br>
<p>Identity theorists (reductive materialists) have a miserable time, because 
<br>
they believe they *are* their current physical instantiation. No uploading 
<br>
for them, and (on most interpretations) no superlongevity through gradual 
<br>
replacement of biology by non-biological components.
<br>
<p>Dualists allow that you can survive the death of your body, but you have 
<br>
one and only one soul. Presumably if souls were thought to be mortal, they 
<br>
would be unhappy as they would have no recourse. Reincarnations hold what I 
<br>
find to be an incoherent view. They identify with a soul that is totally 
<br>
separate from any personality. (If their view were correct, I would have to 
<br>
say that I didn't care if I died, so long as my personality survived.)
<br>
<p>The continuity of consciousness view seems to be held by at least some 
<br>
transhumanists. How this view can be held when many people have clearly 
<br>
lived through a period of complete cessation of neural activity I don't know.
<br>
<p>Functionalism covers a wide range of views in itself. (I set out four of 
<br>
the possible views here: <a href="http://www.maxmore.com/chapter1.htm">http://www.maxmore.com/chapter1.htm</a> ) Most 
<br>
transhumanists would fall into the functionalist camp, whether they are 
<br>
familiar with the category or not. John Clark is clearly some kind of 
<br>
functionalist. But other perfectly good functionalists cannot accept John's 
<br>
view that an identical copy of a person is that person.
<br>
<p>Parfitians (myself included) tend to agree with some functionalists and 
<br>
disagree with John, saying that an identical copy of me is not me. However, 
<br>
we are actually closer to John in that we don't think that identity is what 
<br>
matters. What matters is psychological connectedness and continuity. So, in 
<br>
practice, we are pretty close to John's view. I would not be happy about 
<br>
being destroyed while my life was taken over by a copy made weeks before I 
<br>
was destroyed, but I would far prefer than to destruction and no copying. 
<br>
The more you cut down the overlap, the less disturbed I would be. If you 
<br>
don't activate the copy until after I'm gone, I find it hard to see what's 
<br>
missing.
<br>
<p>Moravecians, however, go much too far in the direction of abstracting from 
<br>
matter. As I've said to Hans, this view is suicidal in practice. While Hans 
<br>
used to look forward to being uploaded -- having the crucial aspects of his 
<br>
identity transferred to another, more powerful medium, he no longer cares. 
<br>
He's eaten the lotus of Platonism. Now he believes that every potential 
<br>
pattern already exists given some sufficiently clever interpretation of any 
<br>
object. It's a kind of bizarre, Platonist panpsychism of all (possible) selves.
<br>
<p>This spectrum of views doesn't cover the whole range, even among 
<br>
transhumanists. For instance, orthogonal to these distinctions, you get the 
<br>
views of someone like Mike Perry (author of Forever For All). Mike's view 
<br>
is that you survive only so long as your current memories survive). While I 
<br>
agree with Mike's views in other respects, my own Parfitian perspective 
<br>
says that I am a process, not a static state. I would prefer to maintain my 
<br>
memories (even the most painful ones), but I will survive into the future 
<br>
even if I forget everything about Max-2001... just so long as Max-2001 
<br>
leads to Max-2002 and so on, in the appropriate way. Max-2001 is a 
<br>
person-stage rather than a person.
<br>
<p>Well that's enough. Time to go to bed.
<br>
<p>I'll wake up a new man.
<br>
