<p>Not necessarily. Hussein and his ilk are rather savvy to the different
<br>
individuals, committees, groups, agencies, etc in our government and
<br>
media and do have a beef with both individuals in the US government and
<br>
in the media who he sees have portrayed him unfairly. He could have a
<br>
reason to be targeting democrats like Daschle and Leahy, since he would
<br>
have expected them to help undermine the hawks in continuing the
<br>
anti-Iraq sanctions policies of the last decade. And we know for certain
<br>
that Hussein has anthrax AND that his agents have successfully
<br>
penetrated this country before (Ramzi Youssef, for starters).
<br>
<p>However, beyond this, the latest news shows that those with right wing
<br>
axes to grind here in the US are generally unable to really engage in
<br>
this sophisticated an attack. This anti-abortion fellow who is charged
<br>
with sending 250 hoax anthrax letters to abortion clinics did not have
<br>
the capability, it seems, to send the real thing. Not that I don't think
<br>
that some radical anti-abortion people wouldn't do so if given the
<br>
opportunity, which leads to another possibility: radical right wing
<br>
extremists here could conceivably be in collusion with an Iraqi supplier
<br>
of real anthrax. If this scenario were to hold, I'd look to people this
<br>
Baarnard fellow knows well in the movement. They may have encouraged him
<br>
to do his mass mailing to help muddy the waters.
