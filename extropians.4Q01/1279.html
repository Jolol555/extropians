The Germans during WWII had an interesting approach to this. Rather than a
<br>
single charge the Hochdruckpumpe section gun had firing chambers paired side
<br>
all along the barrel. Each of these had charges that fired in sequence. The
<br>
ejection rate was reported to be 4500 ft/second. I think the explosive was
<br>
coal dust! Talk about a cheap shot!
<br>
<p>One 150 yards (meters?) long built in Calais was reported to be able to fire
<br>
150mm shells to London!
<br>
<p>Ah, such usless information I remember. Now if I can just rememver the
<br>
shoping list.
