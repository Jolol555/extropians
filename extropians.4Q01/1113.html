<em>&gt;&gt;Anyone who thinks an MD has more of a right to live and work wherever

<em>&gt;&gt;hard-working individual is a burden to society, makes me ashamed to

<em>&gt;You make me laugh!  How about if someone wants to work for your company, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and you tell them, &quot;I'm sorry, but you need a *graduate degree* to work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Wow, Randy, you are the master of the ill-fitting analogy.
<br>
<p>I shouldn't need to point out that people work in jobs that they want and 
<br>
are suited to. USA has many openings for cleaners, fruit pickers, MDs, 
<br>
artists, computer programmers, etc., unlike the imaginary company you 
<br>
mention above.
<br>
<p>As for your housing analogy, rental accommodation is roughly equivalent to 
<br>
how immigration currently does work.
<br>
<p>Saying that others are brainwashed because they don't subscribe to your 
<br>
xenophobic beliefs and crying the underdog because your anti-human ideals 
<br>
inspire disgust doesn't make you right.
<br>
<p>I shouldn't have called you a jerk because in a twisted kind of way you see 
<br>
that as validating your prejudices. But no matter whether I was wrong in 
<br>
allowing my disgust to be voiced, your views are a big mistake. All 
<br>
countries that rose to greatness did so as a result of cultural 
<br>
cross-pollination... and yes, that includes such &quot;worthless&quot; people as 
<br>
fruit pickers, cleaners, waiters, delivery people, clerks, etc.

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.

To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
