<p>Yes, but you can't put the genie back in the bottle. What, instead, can
<br>
we do to neutralize the efficacy of bioweapons? Vaccinations are an
<br>
obvious answer. I think that it's just abominable that we've stopped
<br>
vaccinating for smallpox since 1980. Anthrax and other likely bioweapon
<br>
diseases should also have vaccines widely available in community civil
<br>
defense kits.
<br>
<p>DNA sensor chip technologies are also another way to go: inexpensive
<br>
devices that are constantly sniffing for various pathogens, built into
<br>
your wristwatch. It doesn't matter if each device takes as much as an
<br>
hour to evaluate one sample. If everybody's watch is equipped, and each
<br>
is scanning randomly for any pathogen, when one watch in an area detects
<br>
a pathogen, it can signal other people's watches to test for that
<br>
pathogen as well to determine the area of exposure rather quickly. This
<br>
could also be done for chemical weapons as well as for radiological
<br>
weapons.
