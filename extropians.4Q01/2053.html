<p><em>&gt;Certainly don't ignore them.  But it would be good to also not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accept the first proposed action that comes along without due
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considerations of its consequences, costs (in all measures),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether it is is just response and whether it is likely to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the desired effects.
</em><br>
<p>I think we've given the matter considerable thought, and I think
<br>
our current action is correct. Deatroy those who perpetrated this
<br>
atrocity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;These people were dependent on foreign aid for food before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;9/11.  What food they were getting has largely been disrupted. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We orderd the ending of the truck caravans from Pakistan that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brought in most of the food by 9/16.  Most of rest is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible to deliver while the bombardment continues.  In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;week or two at most (and perhaps already for some areas) it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be too late for many.  Is this actually a goal that any of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;support or desire?  Do we believe that continuing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bombardment is worth this consequence.  I don't.  We can't speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the good of the people as justification for our actions at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this time if our actions are directly threatening the deaths of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;millions of innocent civilians.  
</em><br>
<p>I know where they get their food, and in fact the vast majority of
<br>
it comes from the U.S.
<br>
<p>I've already said I thought we should have done things differently.
<br>
we should have seized a major airbase like the one at Mazer-l-
<br>
Sharif and begun re-establishing food distribution.
<br>
<p>No, we should not stop, not for Ramadan, not for anything at this
<br>
point.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;That will be utterly insufficient to eliminate terrorism.
</em><br>
<p>Your right, a great deal more will need to be done, but placating
<br>
terrorists will not be part of it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Then you are not familiar with history.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
On the contrary history is one of my favorite subjects, especially
<br>
the history of conflict.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I did not say it justifies it.  I said that speaking as if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was only lies and fundamentalism that give rise to the anger is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speaking falsely and simplistically.  There is a big difference.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Their anger is a combination of things including their incorrect
<br>
perception of us, and the way the world works. I have no intention
<br>
of changing to please them. 
<br>
<p>I do not care if they don't like us, but they will care if they
<br>
attack us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I don't parse that sentence.  We say we stand for certain things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the world and I propose that we actually act as if we do and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we correct ourselves where we act as if we do not.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are counting people then their are  over 6 billion reather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;250 million.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>No the U.S, is some 265 million, the rest of the world was not
<br>
attacked, we were. We do stand for many things, one of them is you
<br>
can count on retaliation if you attack us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;That will be insufficient.  Especially as we have already passed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant measures greatly dangerous to our domestic freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and well-being.
</em><br>
<p>We passed a bunch of such measures over the last 8 years and I
<br>
barely heard a peep, except from the NRA.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Then why concentrate your contempt only on their media?
</em><br>
<p>I was making a point about the falsehoods they spread affecting the
<br>
beliefs of the people of the region.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;You do not think that others will also gain money and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sanctuary and support?  There is a lot of wealth in the MidEast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and a lot of anger.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Anybody who wants to be next to die is welcome to try.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Are you ignorning the point that you may be missing something? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or that we are being told ourselves in part lies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;half-truths?  How will you find out?  Do you care to or are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comfortable with the current assumption that the current means,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;horrendous as they may be in consequences of famine in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan, are sufficient and the &quot;right thing&quot;?
</em><br>
<p><p>I am completely confident in our ability to both punish the
<br>
attackers and help the people of Afghanistan.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;No.  We don't know precisely who did the attack.  We do know who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bin Laden is and that he is a sworn enemy but that is not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same thing as knowing he is guilty of this.   
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we do know who did the attack and we do know who they work
<br>
for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you know where the CIAs money had come from, btw, for many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its black ops over the years?  Largely from drugs.  Follow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;source and flow of drugs and you will find the hands and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lifeblood of some of our own cladestine activities.  
</em><br>
<p>I'd be happy to see the people in the CIA who engaged in any such
<br>
activity serve time for such acts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Actually, no they don't when it comes to international law.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps you would say that isn't civilized.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Actually yes they do, even the U.N. recognizes our right to attack
<br>
those who attacked us as valid.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I see.  So much for yuur early seeming claim we were only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;involved in Afghanistan and then would go home.  Will you then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;go after Hammas and other groups?  Do you think you can end or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;eviscerate so much anger by militarily finding the most actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;angry and killing them and inflicting whatever &quot;collateral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;damage&quot; it takes?  To me this is a very very dangerous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;twisted fallacy that can do nothing but much more seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;inflame the world and endanger all of us (all of humanity not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;just us) and what we hold most dear.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Do you think you can placate these groups and they will all go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; away? And at what price?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I think if we do not address the causes of what righteous anger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toward us may be in the region that all the bombs and guns in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world will not be enough to keep us safe.  We should bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;international criminals to justice certainly.  But I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what we are doing now is a step toward justice.  I think it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;step toward further hatred and terror and millions of deaths.  
</em><br>
<p>I don't think their anger is &quot;righteous&quot; at all.
<br>
<p>These people are more than international criminals, they are
<br>
terrorists, and they have comitted an act of war against a
<br>
sovereign nation.
<br>
<p>It's time to pay the price.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think we should have presented our evidence before world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;courts and the Taliban and then demanded bin Laden be turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over.  I think we must stop the bombing now while there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ghost of a chance to save millions of Afghani lives this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;winter.  I think continuing the bombing through the holy month
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Ramadan would be a seen as extremely callous and will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political and cultural disaster.   And most of all I think we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be fools to extend this campaign into other countries in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the region.  
</em><br>
<p>The world court doesn't have the authority and if I have anything
<br>
to say about it, it never will.
<br>
<p>Maybe you missed my last post, as I pointed out we already tried
<br>
the weak liberal &quot;take them to court&quot; bit. We have 5000 people dead
<br>
because of it. We won't be making that mistake again.
<br>
<p>Muslim countries have always fought through Ramadan and so should
<br>
we.
<br>
<p>As to our next step. How do you think there can ever be peace in
<br>
the middle east as long as groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, who's
<br>
sole reason of existence is to destroy Israel, are permitted to
<br>
exist?
