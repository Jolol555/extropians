<em>&gt;     &gt;Anthrax and other likely bioweapon  diseases should also have vaccines widely

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More agreement. Such measures are not flashy but would increase national security

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>As I understand it, there are some considerable problems with
<br>
this approach.  First of all there are over 70 biological agents
<br>
that are considered reasonably effective for bio-weapons. 
<br>
Vaccinations against the full spectrum would be quite a task and
<br>
not exactly health promoting.  Most vaccines take a while to
<br>
build up an immunity and many produce some symptoms along the
<br>
way.  The old smallpox vaccination would not be effective
<br>
against weapons-grade smallpox from what I have heard. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;inexpensive devices that are constantly sniffing for various pathogens, built into
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Might work.
</em><br>
<p>If we had MNT it would be a possibility.  Of course then we
<br>
could destroy any pathogens as soon as they were found.  I am
<br>
not sure how good current technology is at finding these
<br>
pathogens nor how cheaply it can be made.  I assume we are some
<br>
ways away from this capability as the Post Office and such
<br>
claims early detection of Anthrax is quite difficult.
