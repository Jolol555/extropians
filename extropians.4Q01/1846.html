Oh great.  Lets kick the big corporations and big government again.
<br>
<p>How many corporations do you think there are that could afford to
<br>
spend $100 Million on the development of an entirely new computer
<br>
architecture such as Blue Gene.  How many governments are farsighted
<br>
enough to spend $75 Million constructing a Terascale/TeraGrid
<br>
supercomputer and make it available to academics?  How many
<br>
*individuals* are sufficently educated in the United States that
<br>
they would be able to effectively or optimally allocate their tax
<br>
dollars between the NIH and the DoD???  You are an Extropian (presumably)
<br>
and that means you want to optimize the production of complexity.
<br>
Extending lives does that -- but you have to do that by balancing
<br>
the allocation of resources against resisting those unthinking
<br>
microbes trying to rob you for reproductive materials with the thinking
<br>
efforts of people who are trying to destroy you because you disagree
<br>
with their fundamental philosophies.
<br>
<p>*HOW* do you expect the average American to be able to make informed
<br>
decisions with regard to that?  Can you make the case that an
<br>
&quot;uninformed&quot; decision is optimially extropic?
<br>
<p>Now, I've voted for term limits in the past and have been frustrated
<br>
that they have been reversed by the courts.  At the same time, I am
<br>
beginning to realize the value of having politicians with many years
<br>
of experience in Congress so that they can rise to chairpersonships
<br>
of committees and provide an educated perspective on decisions.
<br>
(I note the anti-terrorist laws did have limits on how long they
<br>
remain in effect -- extreme responses by less experienced individuals
<br>
might not have included such provisions -- balanced responses argue
<br>
that we should go back and reexamine whether the costs of freedom
<br>
limiting choices to preserve our security outweigh the benefits of
<br>
our possible losses of freedom).
<br>
<p>I'm going to cite one of the Islamic cleric's, I think from the U.K.,
<br>
who in the light the recent attacks realized that his positions were
<br>
unjustifiable.  Blanket criticisms of the U.S. were potentially
<br>
inflamatory and therefore likely to be counterproductive.  The
<br>
same could be said for criticisms of multi-national corporations
<br>
or &quot;big&quot; government.
<br>
<p>State *precisely* what you think is wrong.
<br>
State *precisely* what you think might be a solution.
<br>
<p>I suspect there are many more construction workers than molecular
<br>
biologists or military officers in the U.S.A. [This is not intended
<br>
as any comment towards construction workers on the list].  Will
<br>
someone here who is in the anti-corporate, anti-government camp
<br>
*please* explain to me how having the construction workers vote on
<br>
how much of their tax dollars get collected or where those tax dollars
<br>
get spent (if they get collected and spent at all) is going to result
<br>
in a greater extropic vector in health care *or* defense than the
<br>
current system?
<br>
<p>This, to me, is the fundamental problem with libertarianism is that
<br>
there is an *implicit* assumption that a free market economy is
<br>
optimal.  But a free market economy is one that is primarily in ones
<br>
own self-interest -- and *most* peoples' own &quot;self-interest&quot; (predisposed
<br>
by genes, warped by social experiences) *DOES NOT* remotely resemble
<br>
an extropic idea platform.  Lets be realistic -- humans are programmed
<br>
for survival, sex and fun -- not complexification.
<br>
<p>Note -- I am not arguing the current system is &quot;optimal&quot;.  I *am*
<br>
arguing that the current system is better than a 1 person = 1 vote
<br>
system where the average person gets to vote on things they are
<br>
ill-qualified to evaluate.
<br>
<p>In preparation for the criticisms -- yes, scientists could spend
<br>
more time educating people so they want to support their efforts.
<br>
But there is only so much time in a day and the time one spends
<br>
educating individuals uneducated in ones area of expertise is time
<br>
that cannot be spent exercising that expertise productively.
<br>
<p>I believe I've stated it before, perhaps in alternate forms, and
<br>
I'll state it again.  If you want to vote on it you have to be able
<br>
to demonstrate sufficient knowledge to cast such votes in a considered
<br>
and rational manner.  *THAT* is what extropianism is about.
<br>
<p>Just because your atoms happen to be organized in the form of a
<br>
&quot;human being&quot; doesn't inherently give you extropic voting rights
<br>
in my book (and Anders can come down on me all he wants for this
<br>
statement).  One has to demonstrate that one isn't inherently
<br>
un-extropic (e.g. bin Laden) and then further demonstrate an
<br>
extropic behavior history before one gets to cast votes in an
<br>
extropic allocation of resources (at least IMO).
<br>
<p>(I will add that there are many people on this list that I would
<br>
willingly defer to with regard to an extropic allocation of some of
<br>
the resources I might contribute to the pool.  As I've suggested
<br>
in other threads it all goes back to trust relationships -- who
<br>
do you trust to allocate your resources responsibly?  Speaking
<br>
honestly -- I do not have the knowledge of, or interest in, many
<br>
areas to know how to optimally allocate resources for those areas.
<br>
I would much rather delegate this responsibility to someone with
<br>
the expertise who can be trusted to handle the job responsibly.)
