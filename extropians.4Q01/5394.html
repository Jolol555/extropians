<em>&gt; A few years ago, I saw a retrospective on the 1960s.  In it, some guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whined about how automation was taking jobs away.  I got the idea the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guy didn't do a study of the problem, but was just mouthing slogans in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the air at the time.  Why would I think this?  Well, partly from his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demeanor I admit and the fact that the person interviewing him didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bother to challenge him on this, but also partly because there are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobs now in total in the US, then there were in the 1960s.
</em><br>
<p>The interesting question though is whether there is a
<br>
significant migration of jobs available toward requiring a level
<br>
of skill and intelligence that only a small minority of the
<br>
population has.  If this is increasingly the case then there is
<br>
a real problem of how the rest of the population will have a
<br>
reasonable standard of living and dignity.  As we near the
<br>
Singularity I am certain we will eventually need to deal with
<br>
this question.  I am pretty sure we already do need to deal with
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Query: As we reach hyper-abundance and most manufacturing is
<br>
near totally automated, exactly why would you require every
<br>
adult to have a normal job in order to have a stake in and
<br>
access to that plenty?  It is quite easy to see there would be
<br>
no meaningful work for them that anyone would care to hire them
<br>
for not far down the road at all.  What then?  In a world of
<br>
plenty why is scarcity based thinking concerning &quot;earning&quot; a
<br>
living appropriate?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the thing holding the Third World back is not the lack of First
</em><br>
<em>&gt; World foreign aid, but the lack of respect for property rights (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hernando De Soto's -- the Peruvian economist NOT the Spanish
</em><br>
<p>In a world where all material items (except fixed land resources
<br>
and so on) can be had simply by asking the local nanobots to dig
<br>
up the pattern and produce it, what exactly would property
<br>
rights apply to and why would you care?
