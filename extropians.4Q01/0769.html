Hijackers may have sent coded messages on Internet

Carl T. Hall, Chronicle Science Writer    Friday, October 12, 2001
<br>
<p>As White House officials warned that Osama bin Laden may be sending secret
<br>
coded messages to his followers through videotaped statements, federal
<br>
investigators are checking into the possibility that the Sept. 11 hijackers
<br>
did the same thing on the Internet.
<br>
<p>Law enforcement specialists say that terrorists have been using hidden
<br>
messages in computer files for years. In past investigations, encrypted
<br>
messages have been ferreted out from files deep within password-protected
<br>
computers.
<br>
<p>&quot;You have to go through multiple layers,&quot; said former FBI agent Clint Van
<br>
Zandt, now head of a Virginia consulting firm that advises corporate clients.
<br>
<p>&quot;First, you have to get the computer, then get into the hard drive, then you
<br>
have to look at each document and see what's behind the veil. It could be in
<br>
the header, the footer, in pictures -- just about anything can have messages
<br>
concealed in it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Security experts said the latest software, which can be readily downloaded
<br>
from the Internet, makes it a simple matter to pass around messages in digital
<br>
images and other files that can be attached to e-mail or loaded onto a Web
<br>
site.
<br>
<p>K.J. Kuchta, a specialist in computer forensics in Phoenix, Ariz., and
<br>
chairman of an information-technology security council of the American Society
<br>
for Industrial Security, counted at least 28 message-hiding software packages
<br>
available as freeware or shareware.
<br>
<p>&quot;There are legitimate uses for it,&quot; he said, notably in the area of preventing
<br>
copyright infringement by planting a hidden brand in a data file. &quot;But it's
<br>
something law enforcement is really going to have to focus on.&quot;
<br>
<p>Scanned photographs can even be spiked with code, printed out and mailed or
<br>
hand-carried to a recipient, who then rescans the image to pull out the
<br>
message. Messages can also be inserted into video or audio files.
<br>
<p>Secret writing has been used to thwart enemies since at least the fifth
<br>
century B.C., the most famous example being that of the Greek Histaiaeus, who
<br>
is said to have written a message -- urging revolt against the Persian king --
<br>
on the shaved head of an aide, who was sent on his way only after the hair had
<br>
regrown.
<br>
<p>The modern form of this ancient hidden-writing technology is known as digital
<br>
watermarking or &quot;steganography.&quot; Although it was developed for legitimate
<br>
commercial purposes, it has become a growing concern for those trying to
<br>
thwart the communications systems of global terrorism networks.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you want to tell someone to go blow something up, this is an easy way to
<br>
accomplish that,&quot; said Scott Craver, an electrical engineer at Princeton
<br>
University writing his Ph.D. dissertation on the forensic analysis of hidden
<br>
electronic data.
<br>
<p>The latest steganography software requires virtually no special skill for
<br>
anyone with access to a computer linked to public networks. &quot;Even the most
<br>
elaborate techniques can be embedded in a computer program and executed just
<br>
by pressing an 'OK' button,&quot; Craver said.
<br>
<p>Perpetrators of the Sept. 11 atrocity are said to have used computers in
<br>
public libraries to stay in touch, although an FBI spokeswoman yesterday would
<br>
not comment on any details of the investigation so far.
<br>
<p>Just about any data file can be used, said Edward Delp, a steganography expert
<br>
and professor of electrical and computer engineering at Purdue University in
<br>
West Lafayette, Ind.
<br>
<p>&quot;You type in your e-mail, attach an image, and to the average person it looks
<br>
like I just sent you a picture,&quot; he said. &quot;You don't necessarily have to be a
<br>
rocket scientist to do this.&quot;
<br>
<p>However, there are standard ways to screen files in order to determine if they
<br>
are clean, the same way computer users rely on software to check for worms and
<br>
viruses in e-mail attachments. So-called &quot;steganalysis&quot; software can be used
<br>
to hunt quickly for telltale statistical clues -- &quot;digital fingerprints&quot; -- of
<br>
hidden data.
<br>
<p>These may be more or less obvious depending on the size of the message, the
<br>
size of the file in which it is carried -- and the sophistication of the
<br>
sender.
<br>
<p>&quot;A lot of people are trying to break these steganographic systems,&quot; Delp said.
<br>
&quot;Some are quite easy to break, some are not. It can be done but the techniques
<br>
are not perfect.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, message-hiding can be readily combined with encryption so that even
<br>
if a message is unearthed, it may be difficult to read accurately. And even if
<br>
a message is unscrambled its true meaning may be clear only to those who know
<br>
a prearranged code word or image.
<br>
<p>Technology can also be used to blur the message, adding some electronic noise
<br>
to a data file that allows a sender to &quot;kind of spread the message out over
<br>
the image, which makes it a lot harder to detect,&quot; Delp said.
<br>
<p>What may appear to an outsider as nothing but static might actually be a
<br>
hidden note, which can be read only by someone running the data file through
<br>
the right filter.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
