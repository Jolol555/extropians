</em><br>
<p>I disagree. Resources don't come from cities. They go there. If it all
<br>
goes down, that's the first place they'll stop going.
<br>
<p>Also, note that I'm not advocating on living in Exclaves full time. The
<br>
whole point is that we go on with our lives wherver we are and have the
<br>
Exclaves for when we feel there is nothing further we can do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * The &quot;dark ages&quot; trigger can not usefully be tested in advance.  99+%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   probability it will either go off while the situation is salvageable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   or fail to go off even after the situation has collapsed.  Either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   way, evacuating upon this trigger is not useful.
</em><br>
<p>I know that you're probably using 99% as a figure of speech, but if
<br>
not, knowing how you calculate these odds can itself be useful
<br>
information. Even if you are using it as a figure of speech, it would
<br>
still be useful to know what assumptions you're making about the sorts
<br>
of triggers that would be used.
<br>
<p>The argument you're making applies to investment. You will either buy
<br>
too high or sell too low, so there is no hope of making money on the
<br>
stock market! Nevertheless I invest (or will when I get out of debt)
<br>
because I believe that if I'm even a tiny bit smarter than 'the herd'
<br>
it will make a big difference in the outcome. I believe that we as
<br>
individuals have the imagination and as a group the knowledge to see
<br>
which way the wind is blowing just a little bit sooner than everybody
<br>
else does. We even have a web-based tool for aggregating our
<br>
collective prescience-- www.ideafutures.com. Now, to come up with some
<br>
good claims (FXers: should this part of the question be moved to a
<br>
particular FX forum, or should I keep it here until specific claims
<br>
can be formulated?)
<br>
<p>One very clear trigger is smallpox outbreak *anywhere* on Earth. The
<br>
conventional wisdom will be &quot;It's a serious problem, and I'll probably
<br>
head for the hills if it spreads to my town.&quot;
<br>
<p>The truth will be &quot;It WILL spread to my town, and a goodly % of the
<br>
population will die. When that happens or even before, there will be
<br>
civil unrest. The current location of the outbreak matters only
<br>
insofar as it gives me an estimate of how much time I have before my
<br>
town is hit.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's one trigger. To use another investment metaphor, I'd like to
<br>
put together a diversified portfolio of such triggers, weighted
<br>
according to their likely severity.
<br>
<p><p>PS: Obviously, if you already live in &quot;the hills&quot; like Mike does, your
<br>
response to epidemic would be different. You might, for example, try
<br>
to convince the town leaders to cordon off the town and put cops in
<br>
protective suits at roadblocks to detain arrivals until they test
<br>
negative. That failing, you could cordon off your property and wait
<br>
for the epidemic to run its course.
<br>

* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
<br>

<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
<br>
