<p>Actually, I don't believe it says that (in Section 6.6).  It does say
<br>
that he expects diamondoid to be more tolerant of radiation than proteins
<br>
because single radiation hits can break the protein backbone.  Eric's
<br>
entire discussion is rather simplified because of extrapolations from
<br>
comparisons with proteins and the fact that he has to speak in
<br>
generalizations because he isn't discussing a specific nanopart design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming that one radiation strike, anywhere, knocks out a nanobot,
</em><br>
<p>I didn't assume that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (_Some Limits to Global Ecophagy_ contains some particularly blatant

</em><br>
<p>I'll leave this aside for the moment as it will require my digging
<br>
into the technical details.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Molecules can be error-tolerant.  Advanced biology is error-tolerant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because advanced biology is created by a long history of evolution, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each individual evolutionary mutation (as opposed to recombination) is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;error&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Actually many molecules &quot;aren't&quot; very error tolerant.  If you transmute
<br>
an atom from one element into another with most of the molecules from
<br>
which nanotech would generally be constructed (CNOHSPSi) you will change
<br>
its bonding properties.  In many uses that significantly alters the
<br>
molecular structure.
<br>
<p>The &quot;error-tolerance&quot; in biology is primarily due to the part
<br>
redundancy and the energy invested in recycling damaged parts.
<br>
In some cases repair is done, e.g. in yeast ~100 out of ~4000 proteins
<br>
are dedicated to DNA repair.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there were ever organisms that didn't use error-tolerant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrates, we don't see them today; they didn't evolve fast enough.
</em><br>
<p>Which may be one reason that there is a &quot;minimim size&quot; for organisms.
<br>
If you are much smaller you don't have sufficient redundancy to
<br>
tolerate conditions which irreparably damage your recycling systems.
<br>
It may also be why there is redunancy in the genetic code.  A
<br>
non-redundant code may not be able to evolve the repair machinery
<br>
necessary to maintain the code (at least with the Earth's background
<br>
radiation flux).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there is no reason why a similar design principle could not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied to diamondoid; model the results of radiation strikes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then design radiation-tolerant molecules.  Similarly, larger assemblies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be designed which lack single points of failure.
</em><br>
<p>No argument, in fact Eric says that redundancy is *required*.
<br>
But there is a significant difference between the amount of
<br>
redundancy required for the normal background radiation flux
<br>
(which has a low neutron flux component) and the redundancy
<br>
required to protect from moderately high doses of neutron beams.
<br>
If you have to add lots of redundancy (or use lots of energy for
<br>
recycling damaged parts) then it is going to have size or energy
<br>
signatures much larger than a &quot;typical&quot; nanorobot.
<br>
<p>One tailors the radiation dose to provide sufficient certainty
<br>
that you have *really* killed whatever nanomachinery might be
<br>
contained in a sample.  We do it now with food irradiation,
<br>
its just that you need a moderately large radiation source
<br>
to utilize it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We may need to move on to bug-resistant software before we can create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology.  I'm not sure I buy the idea that a gigaatom structure can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be completely debugged by a human-level intelligence.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Depends on its complexity.  If its a monolithic structure I'd agree.
<br>
If its composed of a number of much smaller parts I think humans
<br>
may be able to deal with it.  Eric &amp; Ralph's parts to date have
<br>
been in the multi-thousand atom range.  So we are clearly up to
<br>
the task at that level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes.  Because mature nanotechnology is, or can easily be made,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radiation-resistant.
</em><br>
<p>Mature nanotechnology can only be made radiation-resistant up
<br>
to some &quot;specified&quot; level of radiation, just as it can only remain
<br>
heat resistant up to some maximum temperature.  If you want a more
<br>
&quot;secure&quot; environment, you would presumably use higher neutron beam fluxes.
<br>
If you want a *really* secure environment you incinerate all incoming
<br>
materials in a plasma torch.  Of course that requires somewhat more
<br>
energy and you have to reassemble the molecules afterwards -- but
<br>
one *is* &quot;safe&quot;.
<br>
<p>High dose radiation *will* make more radioisotopes in the irradiated
<br>
material.  Mature nanotechnology solves this by being able to weigh
<br>
atoms to 1-Dalton accuracy (Nanomedicine, Section 4.4.3) and because one
<br>
will have the energy and assembly abilities to rapidly disassemble
<br>
and reassemble nanoscales that have been damaged by weighing the
<br>
most highly radioactive atoms (or molecules).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evolution admittedly has a large head start.  I suppose I could buy the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea that the initial stages of nanotechnology will be more fragile than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology,
</em><br>
<p>Yep, unless you build in both disassemblers and reassemblers,
<br>
early nanorobots will only be useful for specific lifetimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; as long as we acknowledge that this is a temporary condition. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But open-air nanotech is not exactly an early stage.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
