<p>This article talks about meglev trains for pseudo point to point transit, a little like what I wrote in a previous posting about
<br>
advanced transportation systems.

Transit system would raise commuting to new heights

TECHNOLOGY REVIEW
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dec. 18 —  Driving from Vienna, Virginia to Washington, D.C., you notice a Metro train broken down in the median. Poor slobs,
<br>
packed in like sardines with nowhere to go, you think to yourself as you sip your travel mug and turn up NPR. Just then a blue pod
<br>
races past you on an elevated guideway at 190 kilometers per hour—inside it, there’s a car just like yours. You look over just in
<br>
time to glimpse a woman in the driver’s seat, a newspaper spread out against the dashboard. You’re not certain, but she may have
<br>
even been catching a nap.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF KRISHNAN RAMU, director of the Center for Rapid Transit Systems at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, has his way, commuters
<br>
in northern Virginia will have it that easy. They won’t have to choose between trains or highways—Ramu wants to provide both, but
<br>
without the crowds and congestion. For about 30 cents a kilometer, they’ll enjoy a rapid, personal transit system that will glide
<br>
them along inside of their own cars using an electromagnetic levitation system—all without even having to even look at the road.
<br>
When they get to their destination, they’ll be able to drive off and head straight to the office garage, having enjoyed the speed of
<br>
mass transit without sacrificing personal space.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The current mass transit systems are not an American solution,” says Ramu. While high-speed trains have carved out a niche
<br>
in countries like Germany and Japan, he says, in the States “people want to go door to door.” In other words, Americans love their
<br>
wheels too much to leave them at home.
