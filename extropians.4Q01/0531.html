Maybe some of you can help with flabbergastering thoughts...
<br>
<p>I don't understand how a quantum computer can work, but I read a little 
<br>
time back that it can do multiple calculations simulataneously. That is, if 
<br>
you have 2 qubits they can perform 4 calculations at once by simultaneously 
<br>
experiencing (in some way I can't begin to understand) all possible state 
<br>
combinations at once. Similarly that 3 qubits &quot;feel out&quot; 8 states, 4 qubits 
<br>
16 states, and so on.
<br>
<p>This would be a pretty impressive computer if I have that right. Would that 
<br>
make it possible to handle all the computations of all the neurons (10^12) 
<br>
and synapses (perhaps 10^3 per neuron) of the brain even taking into 
<br>
account about 1,000 levels of exciteability for each synapse... with just 
<br>
60 qubits!!?
<br>
<p>That can't be right... can it?
<br>
<p>It must require at least one qubit to store an item of information, even if 
<br>
calculations can be made in different ways simultaneously on that one bit 
<br>
of info, it is still just one bit.
<br>
<p>Even if each bit can be a single atom (one day in the future) that still 
<br>
makes a tiny human mind -- using 10^18 atoms for storage. The entire mind 
<br>
would not be that small of course because you still need some way to 
<br>
shuttle the info around inside it, but even if the the means of moving data 
<br>
around required 100,000 atoms for each storage atom the entire thing is 
<br>
still just a sixth of a mole of material! If the &quot;brain&quot; used 
<br>
nanostructures of pure carbon for instance then that would be a device 
<br>
weighing just 2 grams (Avogadro's constant puts 6*10^23 atoms of carbon at 
<br>
12 grams).
<br>
<p>Anybody know if either of these back-of-the-envelope scenarios approaches 
<br>
good sense?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
