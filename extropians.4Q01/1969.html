<em>&gt; It comes down to a question of whether the &quot;free entertainment&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uses of &quot;informarion&quot; are productive from an economic or societal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective.  Yes, we could construct a society where everyone is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;productive&quot; in what we currently perceive as reality?
</em><br>
<p>I question if anybody is clairvoyant enough to distinguish between
<br>
creativity and entertainment... or if such a distinction even exists.
<br>
It sounds to me like the attempts to distinguish basic science from
<br>
applied science-- one makes good money today, the other may start
<br>
making obscenely large amounts of money at any moment without warning.
<br>
<p>I still remember the creative writing class I once took that taught me
<br>
that everybody has a haunting, lyrical, beautiful story inside
<br>
them. Even the jocks and sorostitutes raised on a steady diet of TV
<br>
and trashy pop-music. Even the people who is no good with all them
<br>
words. They're all acorns. All of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As Lee says, &quot;we could instead encourage gradual, incremental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development and universal access&quot;.  Well the patent laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and older copyright laws) seemed to support that.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is necessary is to turn back copyright trends that provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusive long-term rights (beyond a reasonable period)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that information after a limited period of protection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really does become &quot;free&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, for one thing the whole debate can be resolved by gradually
<br>
shortening the lifetime of patents and copyrights down to like five
<br>
years, after which they become public domain. The argument being that
<br>
we're now living on 'internet time' and if you don't make a million
<br>
bucks in the first five years after launch-date, you ain't gonna.
<br>
<p>Also, any software product that gets discontinued should get its
<br>
source code released to the public if that was not already done by
<br>
then. If MS-DOS isn't going to do its publisher any more good ever
<br>
again, it's only rational (from a big-picture standpoint) to throw it
<br>
into the mix and see if anybody else comes up with a novel use for it.
