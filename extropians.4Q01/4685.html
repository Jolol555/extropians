<p><em>&gt; I rented the movie Memento over the weekend...
</em><br>
<p>I identified strongly with the lead character in Memento.  Due to my mental
<br>
illness, drug abuse, and past history of trial-and-error with prescription
<br>
drugs, my memory has gone through the wringer.
<br>
<p>I make a deliberate effort these days to imagine a return to the context
<br>
(environments) where my memories were formed in order to refresh the
<br>
memories.  For example, I often have a pretty noisy mind that's filled with
<br>
circuitous thoughts and senseless chatter.  From the outside, it looks like
<br>
I'm preoccupied with something.  People have mistaken me for an abstracted
<br>
genius.  Little do they know how little signal there is in the noise.
<br>
<p>Anyway, in the past the workplace was a terrifying place for me, because I
<br>
would have to re-introduce myself to my coworkers every day.  One day I'd be
<br>
introduced to someone, have an authentic and sincerely enjoyable
<br>
conversation, then go home.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't think about them
<br>
again until the next time I ran into them at work.  That moment would be
<br>
subjectively experience with horror and anxiety, because I'd only have a
<br>
faint recognition of having met them before, but I wouldn't know their name
<br>
or remember what we had talked about.
<br>
<p>I guess people who have better noise filtering systems might reflect upon
<br>
their day's social encounters several times later in the day, refreshing and
<br>
solidifying long-term memories.
<br>
<p>Now I compensate by writing down names and personal facts after my initial
<br>
encounter is finished but it's still fresh in my mind.  Then I go through a
<br>
little rehersal in the morning before entering the social environment,
<br>
having visualized crossing paths and greeting the various names and faces.
<br>
<p>WHY DON'T CRYONICISTS MAKE DETAILED RECORDINGS?
<br>
<p>About once a year I get back to my home town (Lompoc, CA) to visit my
<br>
father, who lives in the house I grew up in from birth to 6, then 13 to 18.
<br>
<p>Last time, I took my camcorder and walked from the mailbox on the street
<br>
slowly up to the house, inside and around every nook and cranny, then out in
<br>
the backyard and around.  I recorded as much as I could, from the little
<br>
button on the doorbell, to the doorbell itself, to the telephone pole in the
<br>
backyard where we used to shoot crows with the pellet gun.
<br>
<p>Now, at home in Seattle, when I'm out of touch with my inner children, I
<br>
take a little nonlinear cruise on my hard drive to little fragments of
<br>
memories.  The electrical outlet I stuck a paper-clip into when I was 3, the
<br>
swallow's nest in the crest of the roof in the backyard, the kitchen sink.
<br>
It's like a kind of &quot;refresher&quot; of entire networks of memories.
<br>
<p>In terms of &quot;identity&quot;, wouldn't my initial memories of the objects of this
<br>
environment (the angles of the ceiling, walls, door knobs, water faucets,
<br>
sound of the shower door opening, bathtub filling) be some of the
<br>
foundations of my &quot;society of mind&quot;?
<br>
<p>I wonder why each and every cryonics enrollee doesn't have cdroms filled
<br>
with hundreds of thousands of images, millions of images, that can be used
<br>
in the future reconstruction of memories?  I think it's a good idea.  It
<br>
helps me, and I'm not even undead yet.  :)
