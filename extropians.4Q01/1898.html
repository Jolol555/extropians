For all of you who were buying gas masks last month...
<br>
<p>Just saw a CNN report about www.executivechute.com.  They have made
<br>
sport parachutes for years and have now come out with a new, smaller
<br>
fast-opening chute designed for emergency escape from skyscrapers of 20
<br>
or more floors.
<br>
<p>Here is how they tell the story on their web site:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's imagine that you are on the 60th floor at work. There is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a commotion in the hallway that gains your attention. You go to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investigate. Opening your office door you see smoke is starting to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fill the office area. At that moment the fire alarms start blaring.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your first thought...&quot;Get Out!&quot; Then you hear people yelling and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rushing around. You are now on the move for the stairs. As you round
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the corner you find there is small crowd around the doorway leading
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out. Someone pushes the door open, you feel the heat and choking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smoke blasts through the group.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what do you do?! How do you get out now?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, you should wait for rescue by emergency crews. BUT, in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event they can not get to you in time, you now have one last chance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to make it out alive.
<br>
<p>We talked about this idea after the attacks and the consensus was that
<br>
it was not very practical.  Nevertheless this company feels they have a
<br>
market and have just come out with the $800 product this week.  It is
<br>
compact, about 6 inches wide and 2 feet long when packed.  The chute
<br>
cannot be steered and would be quite hazardous but would certainly be
<br>
preferable to jumping out the window without one.
<br>
