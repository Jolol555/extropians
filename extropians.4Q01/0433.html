Christian thing to do, and earned you brownie points with god.

I would have to re-read my history about Dresden, but I know both
Tokyo and Berlin had military objectives. Hiding your militay
elements amongst the civilian population eliminates the protection
civilians supposedly enjoy. Besides there was no such thing as
presicion bombing during WWII.
<p>####  The reason for carpet-bombing entire cities was largely to soften
morale of the enemy, and to extract revenge for Coventry and London. The
civilians had no say about the placement of military facilities - they were
truly innocent. My mother, my girlfriend's mother - they could have been
killed, if the bombs had fallen a hundred feet closer. 
<p>----
There is a difference between killing enemy soldiers where you
yourself are also at some risk, and deliberately murdering unarmed
civilians.
<p>### This is a huge difference, exactly the difference between honourable
soldiers, and despiccable, callous, dishonorable berserker terrorists, true
scum of the earth. But what is it supposed to have to do with courage? 
<p>----
As I indicated, deliberately murdering unarmed civilians is a
definition of cowardice (and a criminal act) in my book.
<p>#### It's a apparent that our definitions of this simple word are widely
divergent. As I indicated previously, my (and the dictionary's ) definition
makes no reference to civilians, whether armed or not.
<p>Since trying to continue a discussion about definitions of commonly used and
usually unequivocal words tends to be fruitless, I suggest we disengage at
at this point, and let each other use his words as he sees fit.
<p>If anything, let me just mention that I asked a random sample of my
English-speaking acquaintances about calling the 911 bombing &quot;cowardly&quot;, and
I they replied that this usage would be just an empty figure of speech,
distinct from the primary meaning.
