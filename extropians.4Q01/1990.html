<p>Countries meddle with each other, always have always will. Deal with it.

</em><br>
<p>Wow, those leaders were popular, kindly, intelligent, honest and
<br>
believed in all types of freedom even free trade. Politicians like that
<br>
are very rare in any country much less the hell holes we're talking about.
<br>
Can you name a few of these paragons of virtue that the CIA so cruelly
<br>
murdered?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; The Saudi government is massively corrupt.
</em><br>
<p>True but I don't see your point. Are you seriously suggesting this is the
<br>
one government where the CIA really should destabilize?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Actually the Shah started getting too independent for our liking
</em><br>
<p>True again.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; so we helped support the fundamentalist and other uprisings and
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; protests against him.
</em><br>
<p>BALONEY! There came a time when it was obvious that the Shah was dead meat
<br>
so there was no point in continuing to support him, but nobody at the CIA is stupid
<br>
enough to help fundamentalists come into power.
<br>
<p><em>      &gt;Talk about a cowardly act.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting how people use that word. When people were raining down insults
<br>
on the hijackers I agreed with them all except one, they were not cowards.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Al-Jareeza happens to be the most independent and competent news
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;source in the Mid East.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but that's not much of a compliment, it's like saying he's the Poet Laureate
<br>
of greeting cards.
