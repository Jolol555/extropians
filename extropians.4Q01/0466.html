<p>
I did an informal experiment yesterday: I refrained from posting on the
<br>
extropians list (in order not to distort the experiment), and simply
<br>
categorized every post for how relevant to extropianism or transhumanism
<br>
it was. 
<br>
<p>My sample was 117 posts. 
<br>
<p>Of these *9* were unequivocally extropian. They expressed concepts and
<br>
values consistent with the principles.
<br>
<p>22 were somewhat related, dealing with cool technology, advances in
<br>
science, economics in a rapidly changing world, social interactions
<br>
between transhumanists and ways of treating motion sickness.
<br>
<p>That leaves 83 posts, 70.1%. These dealt with mainly with politics,
<br>
terrorism, religion, semantics, technical details and a sizeable
<br>
fraction of banter. While I think there has to be a connection between
<br>
extropianism and politics, the views expressed in these posts were in
<br>
practically all cases just traditional views, exactly similar to what
<br>
you would hear on any other mailing list. No applying of extropian ideas
<br>
to current situations, no deeper analysis of how the situation affects
<br>
the extropian project beyond traditional narratives.
<br>
<p>My categorization might have been biased, and not posting myself might
<br>
have distorted the results since I am a prolific poster. The current
<br>
world situation might have been a somewhat biasing factor. But it is an
<br>
easily replicable experiment which I urge people to try out for
<br>
themselves - or perform in the list archives.
<br>
<p>My conclusions:
<br>
<p>The extropians list has no problem with list quality, because that only
<br>
becomes an issue when you try to discuss a particular field. If the
<br>
discussion doesn't have any focus it becomes pointless to ask for list
<br>
quality since there is no way of measuring it - the quality is a measure
<br>
of how well the focus is achieved. The discussions here does not appear
<br>
to focus on extropianism very much. If I had just looked at the emails I
<br>
would have thought this was a social list for the employees at some big
<br>
tech company like IBM. No higher goal than the pleasure of interacting
<br>
with other people through discussion. 
<br>
<p>Is there a problem here? I think so. The social interaction part is
<br>
important, without it extropians would just be an ordinary SIG. But when
<br>
the actual extropian content becomes so small (the core posts were just
<br>
7.7%) the list becomes just an ordinary forum in any case. That means
<br>
that developing new extropian ideas and concepts is not best done here.
<br>
Sure, there is a fairly positive audience here, but the total brainpower
<br>
is directed at everyday issues rather than extropian issues, and the
<br>
real extropian discussion never gets off the ground. It is a bit like
<br>
the critical mass problem with mailing lists: a too small list,
<br>
regardless of how good it is, will not sustain itself. Here we have a
<br>
small extropians list embedded in a big noisy forum.
<br>
<p>I personally hate the eternal list quality discussion - it has recurred
<br>
since the Golden Days and will likely continue until the omega point.
<br>
But I think this is more serious than just people flaming each other or
<br>
saying stupid things: it is about a lack of focus that is undermining
<br>
the development of transhumanist ideas at a cruicial point in time. 
<br>
<p>I find it worrying that many of the most extropian posts were re-posts
<br>
from elsewhere. Jaron Lanier's post today would definitely have made it
<br>
into my &quot;really extropian&quot; category, and he is one of our main critics!
<br>
If we don't produce any good ideas ourselves, others will do it instead.
