Professor Amara  stated:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Besides, I'm rather partial to the Earth, the Solar System, and the Milky 
<br>
Way, and I generally abhor boundaries (one of the reasons I moved to live 
<br>
outside of the
<br>
U.S.). I would rather those flags and stickers show pictures of the Solar 
<br>
System (&quot;Sol we Shine&quot;) or the Milky Way (&quot;Universe Bless the Milky Way&quot;).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Dr. Graps, when there is strong, evidence that there contain other 
<br>
civilizations swinging about other stars, in the milky way, the local group, 
<br>
the virgo cluster, etc., then, perhaps a reason will be found to make common 
<br>
cause with said beings. Until that glorius event, being a citizen of the 
<br>
cosmos is merely poetry. There is always room for the poetic tho'. :-)
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The events since September 11, and my U.S. observations the last weeks,
<br>
have polarized me (unexpectedly) much more as a pacifist, and I know
<br>
now that the U.S. is not a good fit as an environment for me to live
<br>
(or to raise a kid). &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>You have indeed, set down psychological roots elsewhere, in a different 
<br>
society, but that is not necessarilly a bad, thing, if it is a better fit.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Before I moved out of the U.S. ~4 years ago, I was, in a small way, a
<br>
pacifist, believing that one doesn't answer violence with yet again
<br>
more violence. I also believe that any group's rampant unhappiness
<br>
or disrest has an element of truth embedded, and it must be
<br>
addressed in a civil way, or the violent cycle will continue.&gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>Please let me provide an example. I cannot help but remembering a documentary 
<br>
I viewed, last saturday night. It was about the Japanese attack on Nanking, 
<br>
China in 1937. I believe in that particular case the victims of the Japanese 
<br>
army and navy were innocent, and were so poor, and disorganized, that they, 
<br>
personally, could in no way have assuaged the Japanese sense of inferiority, 
<br>
or actually, their deeply held race nationalism.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In human history's most wretched times,  people were labeled and then 
<br>
burned,
<br>
quartered, persecuted, and I see this kind of fear-based labelling on people 
<br>
appearing again. I couldn't escape the feeling that the place where I was 
<br>
born and lived for most of my life (the U.S.) has gone a little bit insane.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Dr. G, one could frame this in another fashion. Neoconservative, Norman 
<br>
Podhoretz once quipped, &quot;a neoconservative is a liberal who has be mugged by 
<br>
reality.&quot; I believe the USA has been mugged by Islamic Fundamentalism, 
<br>
insired and led by the Saudi Wahabbi clan. I believe that the war being 
<br>
fought is not for freedom, so much as against, Islamic fundamentalism. People 
<br>
have a right to say and believe as they wish, until it takes American lives. 
<br>
We may never beat terrorism in the permanent sense, but we can destroy that 
<br>
which has been fostered by the Islamic fundamentalists.
<br>
<p>Finally, I remember responding to one of Damien Broderick's pleas for 
<br>
American restraint (I am paraphrasing). My response was &quot;wait until it 
<br>
happens in Sidney, then you'll see..&quot; I don't know if DB ever read that or 
<br>
deleted my response, but I feel it applies to human perceptions and choices. 
<br>
As to your personal choice of where you fit in, Dr. Graps; Europe isn't so 
<br>
bad, maybe it's what works best for you? Be happy!
