<p>&lt;&lt;        I believe at that time the best estimates were that the American 
<br>
&nbsp;casualties in an invasion of the Japanese homeland would run about one 
<br>
&nbsp;million.  The Japanese casualites at that time were supposed to be running 
<br>
&nbsp;about ten to our one &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Weighing in:
<br>
<p>As a regular viewer of The History Channel, I know consider myself to be the 
<br>
foremost expert on WW2 (breaking into uncontrollable laughter) on this list!
<br>
<p>That aside, here are some factoids I have loined, or learned:
<br>
<p>1) The Japanese had still a couple of million soldiers and imperial marines 
<br>
distributed across Asia. These people, though distributed would still have 
<br>
been a troubling fighting force, if they had a chance to re-gatrher into a 
<br>
full fighting unit.
<br>
<p>2) The Japanese Manhattan project was their version of Dachau, in Camp 777 in 
<br>
Manchuria. The Japanese army tested bubonic plague, anthrax, botulism, 
<br>
smallpox, tularemia, etc., on the Manchurian populace and murdered perhaps 
<br>
80-100k Chinese civilians. The Japanese were planning to use such weapons on 
<br>
Los Angeles and San Francisco, in order to prevent an invasion of the home 
<br>
islands and perhaps win the war.
<br>
<p>The Japanese had stored 5000 zeros in caves around Japan, and would have used 
<br>
them not only for kamikaze strikes against American troops landing, but were 
<br>
also equipped to loosen phosgene gas upon the American invaders.
<br>
Note: This was something Churchill also planned if Operation Zee Lion was 
<br>
enacted (invasion of the UK).
<br>
<p>The Japanese had already been working on their own nuclear bomb projects, but 
<br>
were not close to developing a successful bomb-so they consider the 
<br>
alternative: The radiological weapon.  The rad weapon was to be used on Los 
<br>
Angeles, and to kill with detonated radioactive U-235 enriched uranium.  The 
<br>
German U-boat U-234 surrendered in the Atlantic on May 10, 1945, to the US 
<br>
Navy--a choice by the sub captain.  The sub carried the uranium as well as a 
<br>
disassembled ME-262, and plans and parts for the V2, and modified V1's (used 
<br>
against invading yanks).
<br>
<p>The Japanese had already improved on the design for the nazi Jets and their 
<br>
rocket-plane; which the later was considered to be an excellent kamikaze 
<br>
weapon. The delivery system for the attack on the West coast of the US, was a 
<br>
submarine that carried a single fighter/bomber to deliver Germans or 
<br>
rad-dust. These were actually built and tested, much in the same fashion that 
<br>
the nazi's 6-engine intercontinental bomber was tested (flying within 12 
<br>
miles of Long Island New York in Nov 1944).
<br>
<p>Summing up: They had germs, radiation, poison gas (no nerve gas yet) and the 
<br>
will to employ such goodies, in a fight that they provoked. They were such 
<br>
bastards to people all over Asia, that I wonder how we were so nice 
<br>
afterwards.
<br>
<p>Maybe because they were so vicious to others is the reason they feared 
<br>
surrender? At any rate, some real historians say that the CCCP under Stalin 
<br>
terrified the Japanese (whom they had sign a nonaggression pact with in 
<br>
1942). The Russians apparently made quite an impression on their (Japanese) 
<br>
army leaders, who saw them as implacable and invincible.  I think it may have 
<br>
been because the Japanese leadership suspected that once the commies dug in, 
<br>
they would never let go? Whereas those imbecile Yankees with their Mickey 
<br>
mouse ways.
