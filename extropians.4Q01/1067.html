<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whatever humans do, they merely rerrange atoms. Natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes caused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enrichment. There is no physical law preventing you from counteracting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local entropy increase by a larger entropy increase elsewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the Sun).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Specifically, nanotechnology allows you to establish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facilities for atomic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and molecular separation with very high processivity and/or on a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large scale. At this point, everything material becomes a resource,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting an end to scarcity (at least, for a while).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Quite so.....but change and conversion takes time and I'd be happy to see
<br>
the (blunt instrument) megatechnology moved off world while the nanos get
<br>
born, grow up and start to breed. We're past the 'gleam in the futurists
<br>
eye' stage for the nano - maybe we're at the 'lying back having a cigarette
<br>
after the conception' stage at the moment. Lots of potential and lots of
<br>
work to be done and risks to take.
<br>
<p>Right now I'm concerned with handing custodianship of the planet my kids and
<br>
grandkids. What do the Scouts say? &quot;Leave the campsite the same/better than
<br>
you found it&quot;. Seems I can't do that simple thing in some fairly serious
<br>
areas.
<br>
<p>This thread started with Mr Hawking trying to get peoples eyes looking
<br>
skywards. It's sad, but I can see him trying to make that little difference
<br>
before he shuffles off. I hope it gets further than us converted. He
<br>
deserves that. Even the Titanic had a few life boats. At the moment we have
<br>
a set of metaphorical leaky water wings for the whole planet.

*why doesn't someone find a heap of gold out on those asteroids. Good ol'
<br>
greed'd get'em movin'*
