<em>&gt; Uh, no. Ever heard of feedback effects? Compound interest? The claims
</em><br>
<p>why doubt?
<br>
i live in area very sensitive to climate changes (near mountains)
<br>
my grandma often says that when she lived, winters were _really_ frosty
<br>
here.
<br>
while we have now some of -10 -20 celsius notes in past years, when she
<br>
lived
<br>
-30 happened, and _whole_ winter was cold.
<br>
ofcourse when scientists started to worry about it it was too late... now we
<br>
achieve
<br>
warmer and warmer winter each year... sometimes we have no snow at all, like
<br>
now.
<br>
in past times _whole_ winter was frosty. whole.
<br>
ofcourse it is better for enviroment now, because we don't use so much
<br>
fossil fuels to
<br>
warm our apartaments. indeed our ghetto switched to ecological 6MW heat
<br>
supply
<br>
(we can't transfer energy over power lines because of taxation, so we use
<br>
steam and converters)
<br>
while previous engine was ran on black coal.
<br>
also wegetative cycle increased.
<br>
on the other hand summer is very hot.
<br>
<p>i am curious - will global warming induce 'latch' effect... i mean,
<br>
when it will cross certain point it can dramatically change microclimates,
<br>
afterall more energy is cumulated... even small temperature rise may abolish
<br>
homeostase of
<br>
ecosystem.
<br>
we have problems with insects when winter fails to come. usually many
<br>
insects die during strong colds.
<br>
this caused real plague of a kind of (chrabaszcz - dunno how it shold be in
<br>
english)
<br>
near my house few years ago.
<br>
more insects - more birds.
<br>
this was beautiful phenomenon... but...
<br>
more birds - more cats.
<br>
we have 'sentinel' on each streetcorner now.
<br>
i did not any research on what can be next (probably humans will start to
<br>
eat cats
<br>
when hunger will increase)
<br>
when commet arrived i watched it from road near my house, wondering how to
<br>
catch it and bring to earth,
<br>
will such behaviour be safe (will not cause change in homeostase of our
<br>
gravitational system)
<br>
and wondered to who comet _belong_ - the man who predicted it will come? or
<br>
to one who'll be able to catch it?
<br>
surely can contain valuable information...
<br>
and then a cat came on my left (sat and started observing the sky) -
<br>
obviously i realised that cats can see more
<br>
stars than any human can do.
<br>
after a while i saw a ferret(or similar) - on my right, also starring at the
<br>
comet.
<br>
i smoked a joint to stay there for a while, but comet was only a comet for
<br>
me, so i went back to my house.
