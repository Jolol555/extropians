<p>Wow!  I am amazed by your powers of extrapolation.  Why, I
<br>
didn't even have any idea myself that what I really had in mind
<br>
included these things!  Will wonders never cease?  
<br>
<p>&quot;A citizen&quot;, I did write, but I wrote nothing in the above about
<br>
&quot;the Government&quot; nor did I address who decides who is sane
<br>
enough to own guns or anything else at all.  And &quot;the
<br>
Government&quot; doesn't automatically mean some over-bearing
<br>
near-totalitarian state except to the most rabid of anarchist of
<br>
which I am not one.  I believe there are sane ways to hold
<br>
people responsible for their actions and to extract sane
<br>
reasonable estimates (from past actions and so on) of how much
<br>
to entrust a person with.  But very generous levels of trust
<br>
would be the default for all persons until they prove these
<br>
estimates are too generous in certain respects in my world
<br>
model.   In my world view government is subservient to the
<br>
citizens, not the other way around, generally speaking.
