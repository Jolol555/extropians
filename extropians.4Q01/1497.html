CIA Gets New Powers To Eliminate Bin Laden As UAVs Get Armed
<br>
<a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/uav-01k.html">http://www.spacedaily.com/news/uav-01k.html</a>
<br>
The Predator UAV is now being armed with Hellfire anti tank missiles in case
<br>
of any unexpected opportunities for termination
<br>
<p>US President George W. Bush has explicitly ordered the CIA to eliminate Osama
<br>
bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network, and has granted the agency sweeping powers
<br>
to do so, the Washington Post reported Sunday, quoting senior US government
<br>
officials.
<br>
The president also added more than one billion dollars to the agency's war on
<br>
terrorism, most of it for the new covert action, the report said.
<br>
<p>The operation will include what officials said is &quot;unprecedented&quot; coordination
<br>
between the Central Intelligence Agency and commando and other military units,
<br>
according to the Post.
<br>
<p>Bush has instructed the CIA to attack bin Laden's communications, security
<br>
apparatus and infrastructure, the paper quoted senior government officials as
<br>
saying.
<br>
<p>According to the report, US intelligence agencies have identified new and
<br>
important specific weaknesses in bin Laden' al-Qaeda network, and these
<br>
vulnerabilities will be the focus of the lethal covert action.
<br>
<p>&quot;The gloves are off,&quot; a senior official told the Post. &quot;Lethal operations that
<br>
were unthinkable pre-September 11 are now underway.&quot;
<br>
<p>Last spring, US intelligence officials obtained high-quality video of bin
<br>
Laden but were unable to act on it, the report said.
<br>
<p>The video showed the al-Qaeda chief and his entourage at one of his known
<br>
locations in Afghanistan. But neither the CIA nor the US military had the
<br>
means to shoot a missile or another weapon at him while he was being
<br>
photographed.
<br>
<p>Since then, the CIA-operated unmanned drone Predator, which normally carries
<br>
only high-resolution cameras, has been equipped with Hellfire antitank
<br>
missiles that can be fired at targets of opportunity, according to The Post.
<br>
<p>The technology was not operational at the time bin Laden was caught on video,
<br>
the report said.

<p>Global Hawk Operating Base Selected
<br>
&nbsp;Langley AFB (AFPN) July 27, 2001
<br>
The US Air Force has selected Beale Air Force Base, Calif., as the first
<br>
Global Hawk main operating base. Air Force officials recently completed an
<br>
environmental assessment and found basing 18 of the unmanned aerial vehicles
<br>
at Beale would result in no significant environmental impacts.

<p>Global Hawk Clocks Up 1,000 Hours
<br>
&nbsp;Edinburgh AFB - May 23, 2001
<br>
