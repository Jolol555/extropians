<em>&gt; Incorrect. Jordan booted them (Palestinians) out decades ago in response
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Which is why what I said is actually correct, and more importantly 
<br>
relevant to the original contention regarding the less-publicized 
<br>
occupation of Palestinian land by Syria and Jordan.  My friend I 
<br>
referenced of Palestinian decent, had parents that lived peacefully for 
<br>
a time in Jordan.  Getting back into Jordan for him is a breeze, and 
<br>
he's treated well.  Getting back to his own parents' land in occupied 
<br>
Palestine is a bitch.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Straw man.  Who said anything about &quot;kicking in governments&quot;?  I'd just

<em>&gt;&gt; Let those governments stabilize and defend themselves.  If they want

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to give them a hand.  Currently, though, I don't understand why we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; supporting the countries that we are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You still have not answered my demand to show where in the US budget we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are providing any financial aid of any sort to the governments of Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabia or Kuwait (Kuwait, BTW IS a democratic government).
</em><br>
<p>Umm, the Gulf War springs to mind as direct support for Kuwait.  Our 
<br>
military presence in Saudi Arabia speaks volumes to the Arab world.  My 
<br>
Palestinian friend feels that it's obvious that no overthrow of the 
<br>
Saudi government could ever occur while the ruling family continues to 
<br>
work with the US.  Without the threat of overthrow, the Saudi government 
<br>
is unlikely to work with its dissenters.  I've seen his opinion echoed 
<br>
by other Arabs I've seen interviewed on television, so I don't see why 
<br>
showing actual US budget figures has to factor into a matter that's more 
<br>
one of perception than anything else.
<br>
<p>Btw, Kuwait is hardly a democratic government: 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.emulateme.com/content/kuwait.htm">http://www.emulateme.com/content/kuwait.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
- It's referred to as a 'nominal constitutional monarchy'
<br>
- Only 10% of its population are allowed to vote
<br>
- The executive branch is completely unelected
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Liberals always want to have things both ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Oh, man.  I certainly hope that you're not calling me a liberal.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Them's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fightin' words.  I'd characterize myself as a libertarian, or at worst
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; an atheistic conservative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With a tendency to apologize for anyone who hates jews.
</em><br>
<p>Wow, what a truly f***ing hurtful thing to say.  I guess it hurts most 
<br>
because I've had some measure of respect for your positions in past 
<br>
threads.
<br>
<p>I certainly have better things to do than take this.  Conversation over.
<br>
