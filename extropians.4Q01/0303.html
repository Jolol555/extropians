<em>&gt; &gt; Years ago, I read an article about a NASA researcher who came up with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technique for inoculating you against all manner of motion sickness.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trouble was that it required about a dozen hours of non-stop nausea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've wondered whether if it were commercially available, I would go through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it, in order to gain a lifetime of being able to read on long car rides,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc.  And just who volunteers for studies like this....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, as a kid I used to purposely go on the worst carnival rides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeatedly in order to build up my resistance to motion sickness. I used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get quite nauseous while reading in a moving car, but no longer. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Turkish Twist' was one of my favorites.
</em><br>
<p>I've been through what amounts to the same thing--Meniere's Disease.  I no
<br>
longer have attacks, but I can still experience motion sickness (I could
<br>
always read in a car, though).  The vestibular system is a complex thing,
<br>
and it's hard to predict how it will respond to overstimulation or
<br>
infection.  It is also hard to predict how people's brains respond to
<br>
changes in sensory input.  In severe cases, patients have their vestibular
<br>
systems destroyed to stop the attacks; some recover well after a bit of
<br>
therapy, readjusting to using vision and proprioception to perform the
<br>
common tasks of life, like walking and standing, that they used to use
<br>
their balance organs for.  Some don't recover well at all, and are barely
<br>
able to stand even with their eyes open.
<br>
<p>In short, tinkering with sense organs can be pretty risky.  There are
<br>
cetainly great things possible to gain from it, like laser eye surgery or
<br>
cochlear implants, but I wouldn't try something like that until it had
<br>
been well tested and provided clear benefits.
