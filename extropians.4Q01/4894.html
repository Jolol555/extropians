<em>&gt; The problem here is that this might lead to a confusion of words with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree. That's why I think it's dishonest to use the word &quot;mind&quot; to
<br>
indicate something akin to &quot;soul.&quot; The ghost in the machine, or the homunculus
<br>
in the brain, or the phlogiston in the flame, are all useless hypotheses, and
<br>
un-extropian wastes of time.

<em>&gt; Do they actually deny the differences exist, or  like me, do they think said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences are not a factor in leadership abilities?
</em><br>
<p>If they're not a factor in leadership abilities, then they should not be a
<br>
factor in criminal tendencies. But they are... in both cases, IMO.

<em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want our government (little as I want a government) to act in ways that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are allowed by the laws, and consistently with freedom.
</em><br>
<p>That will require getting rid of the socialists in the US government.
<br>
(Socialists are the ones who think government can fix everything.)

<p>From: &quot;Kai Becker&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:kmb@kai-m-becker.de?Subject=Re:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;005b01c18b54$226d80c0$3f5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">kmb@kai-m-becker.de</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Oh, I'm sorry. It's so easy then. Just raid the offices of Al'Qaeda in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US and get their member lists...
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you're sorry, you're just misinformed. It's not easy at all to
<br>
find terrorist groups in the US, because of the civil liberties that US
<br>
residents enjoy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I repeat: Who _exactly_ are &quot;they&quot;? What are the criteria? Which of the 276
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mio. persons in the US are &quot;members of their group&quot;? What about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;presumption of innocence&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Who they are is a really good question (and a very obvious one) to which FBI,
<br>
CIA, etc., would definitely like to know the answer. The criteria will have to
<br>
be left up to those whose job it is to find the terrorists. The same applies
<br>
to deciding who are members of terrorist groups. Yes, what about &quot;presumption
<br>
of innocence&quot;? Mothers Against Drunk Drivers disposed of that presumption
<br>
years ago. Just the fact that someone has a tiny amount of alcohol in their
<br>
blood is sufficient grounds for conviction and incarceration, even when no
<br>
person or property has been harmed in any way, and no crime has been
<br>
committed. Have you ever complained about that insidious destruction of civil
<br>
rights? People who complain about erosion of civil liberties because of the
<br>
treatment of one tenth of one percent of Arabs/Muslims in the US are much too
<br>
late and often motivated by personal ulterior agendas, IMO.
<br>
<p>AFAIC, religious fanatics are far, far more dangerous than any number of drunk
<br>
drivers.
<br>
If you would like to start a campaign against religious fanatics, I'll help.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
