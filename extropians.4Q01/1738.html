</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Prisoners of War do not have 5th Amendment rights, since their actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are not considered 'crimes' per se. Moreover, nobody has a 5th amendment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; right in respect to knowledge of events yet to occur.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Citizens and foreign nationals pulled in in an open sweep on no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; grounds or very weak grounds or their nationality or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethnicity or their religion or age and gender or some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; combination ... are &quot;prisoners of war&quot;?  Excuse me?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once again, you are talking out your ear. Almost all were swept up on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immigration violations. The rest were swept up because they had personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction with the known hijackers or with other al Qaeda operatives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Guess again.  Some were swept up on immrigation irregularities
<br>
for sure but that does not in the least make them terrorists,
<br>
likely terrorists or likely to know anything about terrorists. 
<br>
Whatever infractions were useful were used in the sweeps.  But
<br>
do you believe the million or two estimated to have expired
<br>
visas and such in this country should all be subject to
<br>
narcoanalysis as was proposed by you?  If so, why?  How do you
<br>
justify this?  That you assume the rest had interactions with
<br>
know hijackers is quite interesting since you have no way of
<br>
acquiring such knowledge as most of the details and even the
<br>
identities of the 800-1000 picked up are not public.  So is this
<br>
an assumption?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In a war of insurgency, as this one is, there are no front lines to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'capture' prisoners on. This ain't no Stalag 13, no &quot;Hogan's Heros&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lady. Wake up and smell the patchouli. The enemy has infiltrated our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homeland, they walk among us, dress like us, and try to act like good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little westernized muslims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is more assumption on your part.  There are no major
<br>
insurgents in this country.  There are some terrorist
<br>
activities.  But they aren't exactly the same thing.  Wake up
<br>
yourself before you or yours are dragged in on some pretect. 
<br>
Perhaps you are not in Hogan's Heroes but you are definitely in
<br>
some different paraonoid movie than I am.  Are you now holding
<br>
all muslims suspect until/unless they undergo narcoanalysis?  
<br>
If so you are a very scary individual in my book.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of the four particular prisoners I spoke of, who are known to have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in the 9-11 events, I have absolutely no compunctions about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using any means to interrogate them. For the rest, I'd give them the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; option of staying here and talking or being shipped home to their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government police agencies along with a list of questions to ask. 
</em><br>
<p>I see.  For any and all infractions you would ship them home
<br>
preferably to be tortured without getting any blood on your
<br>
hands.  Is that accurate?  Aren't you also ignoring that
<br>
nationalized citizens and people born and raised here were also
<br>
picked up in the sweeps?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that talk, and have no probable cause, get released and/or deported (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are breaking immigration law already). As far as I know, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only about 150 of the 800+ still in detention, so our government isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being as extreme as you are trying to make out here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Dunno.  I haven't heard that revised count myself.  If true it
<br>
is good news except for the worry about the implied ability to
<br>
do the same and worse next time.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People do not have the right to say &quot;I don't know&quot; without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; having their minds tampered with by force to see if maybe they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do know or say they do under such influences and coercion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Since when?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since this is NOT a civilian criminal case. This is a war. They ain't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same thing. Intelligence collection, especially in preventing more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war crimes, is of paramount importance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is a civilian case until you show, not assume, that a suspect
<br>
is involved in violent activities or planning and aiding such
<br>
activities against the US.  War has rules.  Even prisoners of
<br>
war have some rights.  But these do not qualify as POWs. 
<br>
Intelligence gathering is more important than rights? 
<br>
Assumptions and paraonoia trump rights?  Rights are suspended
<br>
always in the name of security even if there is no proof of any
<br>
greater security acheived?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The majority of these people are not even accused of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge but are brought in just in case they do or in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the government to look like it is doing something, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is wrong, morally questionable and very dangerous to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and civil rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you know that?
</em><br>
<p>Because there was no legal accusation against most of the people
<br>
detained.  Legal accusations become matters of record.  Because
<br>
very precious little was acheived except to make some of more
<br>
wary of the power exercisable in the name of &quot;protecting&quot; us by
<br>
our &quot;civil servants&quot;.  But I am not totally sure what you are
<br>
asking me.  Are you asking how I know that it is dangerous for
<br>
government officials to have the right to drag me from my home
<br>
and hold me incommunicado on suspicion and perhaps use (if some
<br>
had their way) even administer various drugs to get me to say
<br>
what they want to hear?  Are you asking me how I know that it is
<br>
dangerous and wrong to hold people without charges and
<br>
incommunicado and, if some of the stories are true, without
<br>
adequate food and facilities expected by international
<br>
conventions?
