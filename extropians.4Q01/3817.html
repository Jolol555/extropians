<em>&gt; JARON LANIER: THE CENTRAL METAPHOR OF EVERYTHING?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [12.4.01] One of the striking things about being a computer scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this age is that all sorts of other people are happy to tell us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that what we do is the central metaphor of everything, which is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ego gratifying. [...]
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps this is because computers are a general-purpose tool that
<br>
is used by humans and therefore computing models resemble human
<br>
processes in order to assist humans effectively?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then I became concerned for a different reason which was pragmatic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate: I became convinced that the overuse of the computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaphor was actually harming the quality of the present-day design of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer systems.
</em><br>
<p>While I believe I agree with Jaron here, it's for reasons different
<br>
to his.
<br>
<p>He talks about how the notion of &quot;files&quot; as an organizational model
<br>
for information has become ingrained within the framework of the
<br>
modern computing model precludes us from introducing new and
<br>
potentially better organizational models.  I find someone of his
<br>
reputation and accomplishments to ever make a statement that sounds
<br>
so opposed to the notion of &quot;innovation against the odds.&quot;  Perhaps
<br>
what really needs to be asked is, &quot;How did we end up using the
<br>
'files' metaphor over all others?&quot;
<br>
<p>If someone did suggest a better metaphor for information storage
<br>
and management, would our collective complacency with our existing
<br>
technological status prevent us from even exploring it?  I think
<br>
Jaron's suggesting that the answer is yes.  Scary thing is, I
<br>
think he might be right.
<br>
<p>In the current day, when massive amounts of information can be
<br>
stored and processed in reasonable time given today's availble
<br>
computing power, it's time we moved away from looking at computers
<br>
from the &quot;how&quot; to the &quot;what&quot; or &quot;why&quot; ... we have been building
<br>
computers to be better and better at understanding how we do
<br>
things -- in other words, executing pre-described processes --
<br>
and not about what we do or why we do them.  Yes, there's work
<br>
being done on semantic webs and artificial intelligence is
<br>
a well established field, but they're still both exercises in
<br>
telling computers how things are done.  We haven't even begun
<br>
the process of trying to explain to computers what is going on
<br>
or why things are happening.
<br>
<p>What we've been working on and building all these years are
<br>
just 'computers' -- literally -- that follow processes and
<br>
manipulate data in a thoughtless fashion.  In this direction,
<br>
Moore's Law (well, prediction) may hold true.  It will not
<br>
be until we move away from building better 'computers' (things
<br>
that just compute) and start building a true learning machine
<br>
that we'll really see the next breakthrough.
<br>
<p>I don't know where the start is, or where it could possibly
<br>
end, but I'd like to be there to see how it unfolds.
<br>
<p>Perhaps a good first step is to stop treating information
<br>
as second-class &quot;files&quot; and instead as first-class &quot;objects&quot;
<br>
in a large-scale object hierarchy.  Very frightening, but
<br>
that's where I'd take my money if I had to.

The adult entertainment industry needs another technological boost
<br>
beyond plain multimedia streaming, and &quot;smell-o-vision&quot; just isn't
<br>
good enough.
