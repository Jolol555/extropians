<em>&gt; I read Eliezer's eloquent post after I wrote mine about dumping, now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm afraid some may think I advocate Social Darwinism, I certainly don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I should have said I like to take advantage of the stupid and powerful but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the stupid and weak. Evolution is a horrible process, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society along those line would make it as cruel as nature itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or God if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is one. It's a nightmare, a downright evil philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>Well now hold hard here. As a possible social darwinist myself (depending on
<br>
which definition you want to use), I have to try and argue the other point
<br>
of view. Isn't it more cruel and evil to put structures in place or leave
<br>
existing structures in place that guide people towards living suboptimally
<br>
by protecting their suboptimal lifestyles, or otherwise making it easier for
<br>
them to live suboptimally than to strive and become better? The candlemaker
<br>
fallacy writ large and all that. It seems that there's a thousand different
<br>
types of candlemaker these days.
<br>
<p>Most classically socialist ideas on redistribution of wealth are cruel in
<br>
this way. As are the welter of laws and cultural bias towards a lack of
<br>
personal responsibility and honesty in modern society. It's a terrible thing
<br>
to have a system of laws in place that present the opportunity of enormous
<br>
financial rewards to those who can convincing push responsibility for their
<br>
own actions onto third parties.
<br>
<p>We're going to end up with an ugly, ugly society before too long if we're
<br>
not careful.
<br>
<p>I was rereading Gravity Dreams [Moddesitt] (basically an extended essay on
<br>
the necessity for honesty in a technological society] the other day, and
<br>
looking around I see that modern Western society seems to be sliding down a
<br>
slope built on dishonesty of all sorts. Our laws are built on lies, and
<br>
justified with more lies. There is the way you should act and behave in
<br>
order to receive the reward of societal approval, and then there is what
<br>
everyone really thinks.
<br>
<p>I'm becoming somewhat disillusioned with the American Dream of late. I came
<br>
to the states because I viewed it as the land of opportunity, where --
<br>
unlike the UK at the time -- opportunities abounded for turning talent into
<br>
money. Of course, you can't escape yourself and you can't escape humanity.
<br>
There's really little difference between the sides of the Altantic these
<br>
days. A lot of opportunity in the UK now. But the same stupid laws, the same
<br>
stupid lies, the same stupid politicians. The same monsterous hypocrisy that
<br>
smothers every human interaction. Conform, conform, lack of freedom. Idiot
<br>
regulators in Brussels on one side, idiot regulators in Washington on the
<br>
other. All the same.
<br>
<p>You know, freedom of speech and privacy rights are a big deal. Were a big
<br>
deal. Yet another thing, these days, that's really no different in practice
<br>
in the UK and the USA. That really shouldn't bother me, but it does.
<br>
<p>I guess that those of us who came to the US were starry-eyed. Then we got
<br>
hit over the head, slowly over the course of a couple of years. I'm just
<br>
disappointed. I'm disappointed that America turned out to me just as mired
<br>
in dishonesty and self-delusion as the UK; I'm disappointed that living in
<br>
the US and watching the evolution of laws and culture turns out to be just
<br>
like living in the UK and watching the stultifying hand of Brussels slowly
<br>
choking the desire for innovation, change, new things and freedom in a sea
<br>
of red tape.
<br>
<p>Sadly, I'll bitch, but that's all I'll do. It's a problem, but so is aging.
<br>
That one comes first, and an ugly, dishonest society is no impediment
<br>
developing the necessary technologies.
