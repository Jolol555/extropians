<p>I think this is a very attractive approach, but there's an issue of whose
<br>
behavior are we interested in?  If we look at software copies then we'll
<br>
probably find that most of them think identity is preserved by uploading
<br>
and copying. If we look at physical copies then we may find that most of
<br>
them think identity is not preserved by uploading and software copying but
<br>
is preserved by physical copying. If we look at originals then we may find
<br>
that most of them think identity is not preserved even by physical
<br>
copying.
<br>
<p>Another way to think about this is what does fitness means in a posthuman
<br>
world? For example someone who is very promiscuous about allowing his mind
<br>
to be copied might end up having many copies of himself, but most of them
<br>
may become permanently enslaved by others. Do these slaves count toward
<br>
his reproductive fitness? Or consider a superintelligence that manages to
<br>
maintain mind coherence as it expands in space and stays a single entity
<br>
(think the Blight). Does it have low fitness because it doesn't reproduce
<br>
in the traditional sense? Or consider a physical copy versus a software
<br>
copy, or a running copy versus a static stored copy. How do each of these
<br>
count towards reproductive fitness?
