<p><em>&gt;I suspect there are many more construction workers than molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biologists or military officers in the U.S.A. [This is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intended as any comment towards construction workers on the list]. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Will someone here who is in the anti-corporate, anti-government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;camp *please* explain to me how having the construction workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vote on how much of their tax dollars get collected or where those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tax dollars get spent (if they get collected and spent at all) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to result in a greater extropic vector in health care *or*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defense than the current system?
</em><br>
<p>I'm a construction worker, but I'm also pro-corporation and pro-
<br>
reasonably sized government.
<br>
<p>I have no problem seeing the advantage to investing in scientific
<br>
research, and I doubt many of my associates do either.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This, to me, is the fundamental problem with libertarianism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there is an *implicit* assumption that a free market economy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is optimal.  But a free market economy is one that is primarily in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ones own self-interest -- and *most* peoples' own &quot;self-interest&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(predisposed by genes, warped by social experiences) *DOES NOT*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remotely resemble an extropic idea platform.  Lets be realistic --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans are programmed for survival, sex and fun -- not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complexification.
</em><br>
<p>I tend to agree for now, government of a certain size functions as
<br>
an effective check on free markets, and will continue to do so till
<br>
something better comes along.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Note -- I am not arguing the current system is &quot;optimal&quot;.  I *am*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arguing that the current system is better than a 1 person = 1 vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system where the average person gets to vote on things they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ill-qualified to evaluate.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree, the more information in the system the better. I
<br>
think history has shown the fallacy of &quot;those who think they know
<br>
best.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In preparation for the criticisms -- yes, scientists could spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more time educating people so they want to support their efforts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But there is only so much time in a day and the time one spends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;educating individuals uneducated in ones area of expertise is time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that cannot be spent exercising that expertise productively.
</em><br>
<p>I think all members of a society have the right to self
<br>
determination, I'm against elitism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I believe I've stated it before, perhaps in alternate forms, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'll state it again.  If you want to vote on it you have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge to cast such votes in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considered and rational manner.  *THAT* is what extropianism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about.
</em><br>
<p>Demonstrate it according to whose criteria?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just because your atoms happen to be organized in the form of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;human being&quot; doesn't inherently give you extropic voting rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in my book (and Anders can come down on me all he wants for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statement).  One has to demonstrate that one isn't inherently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;un-extropic (e.g. bin Laden) and then further demonstrate an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropic behavior history before one gets to cast votes in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropic allocation of resources (at least IMO).
</em><br>
<p>Not the way it works in this society. Like I've already said I
<br>
think history has dispelled the &quot;we know best&quot; fallacy.
