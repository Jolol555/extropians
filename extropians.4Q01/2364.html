<p>
Words do not have meanings- individual humans have their own personal meanings for words. The observer creates its local model of
<br>
reality through a process of imperfect observation.
<br>
<p>Market: A physical system composed of two or more humans engaging in one or more transactions with each other. This definition is
<br>
restrictive (to &quot;humans&quot;) as most useful definitions are- which is what the word &quot;definition&quot; means to the writer. The definition is
<br>
at the same time expansive- &quot;market&quot; is a generic description of a physical process of matter and/or information exchange. The
<br>
definition is also 'fuzzy'- e.g. what is &quot;human&quot;? Some more common examples of markets- the government bond market, the tulip-bulb
<br>
market, the stock market, currency market, arms market, CDOs, OTC derivatives, corporate paper- are further restrictions of this
<br>
definition. Less common examples that are compatible with the definition above are such things as a war, a meat market, an email
<br>
list and other such economic problems.
<br>
<p>Transaction: An exchange of &quot;matter-information&quot; A transaction requires a 'transmitter', a 'receiver' and an information carrier. It
<br>
does not presume self-awareness. Some examples- an email, a kiss, a speeding bullet, a gift, a photon exchange.
<br>
<p>The enumeration of definitions can be carried out ad infinitum; the word &quot;matter&quot; for example is not satisfactorily defined even by
<br>
physicists. The utility of definition is reductionist- to create artificial categories that can be treated as independent abstract
<br>
objects: &quot;elaborate hallucinations&quot;or &quot;spooks&quot;. This is like a double-edged sword-
<br>
&quot;Language creates spooks that get into our heads and hypnotize us.&quot; - Robert Anton Wilson
<br>
<p>A more inclusive definition of &quot;market&quot; could consider any transaction(s) between &quot;living&quot; organisms-
<br>
<p>The Flying-Bird Market
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A flock of birds exhibits un-birdlike behaviors; 'emergent' properties such as 'V' formations, roiling and folding over upon
<br>
&quot;itself&quot;. Yet we do not usually speak of the &quot;will of the flock&quot; as being an intelligent, guided process with its own volition
<br>
independent of the birds themselves. The intelligence, or information processing, is carried out entierly within the bodies of the
<br>
individual birds that are considered to be members of the flock. Each bird is acting within the guidance strictures of its own,
<br>
unique nervous system.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each individual bird-in-flight is sending and receiving signals to the other birds-in flight nearby, that is, each bird is
<br>
engaging in a series of transactions with the other birds 'invested' in the &quot;flying-bird market&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;flying-bird market&quot; is ephemeral- it is a physical process arising from individual behavior. It can be thought of as being
<br>
created sometime after the first bird takes flight, and annihilated (the market is destroyed) sometime before the last bird lands.
