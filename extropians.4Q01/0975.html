</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is correct, but I don't think it is quite right to say that
<br>
the answer depends on the frame of reference.  The right answer,
<br>
consistent with your example, is that the path between two points in
<br>
spacetime which maximizes the perceived elapsed time is that which
<br>
experiences no acceleration; that is, a geodesic curve, the equivalent
<br>
of a straight line in spacetime.  This optimal path can be considered
<br>
to be observer-independent.
<br>
<p>Now, in general relativity there may be multiple geodesics which go
<br>
from one point to another; for example, throwing a ball into orbit and
<br>
letting it come back, versus throwing a ball straight up and letting it
<br>
fall back.  You can arrange for these to take exactly the same amount of
<br>
time and both are geodesics.  But in principle the elapsed time along
<br>
the two paths may be different.
<br>
<p>Each of the geodesics is a local extremum in distance and in elapsed
<br>
proper time along the path.  If there are multiple geodesics, one of
<br>
them will be the maximum.  In the case of the ball example, I would
<br>
guess that the orbiting observer will experience less proper time,
<br>
because it is lower in the gravitational field.
