It has been stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;The frequently included quibbles, rephrasings, and &quot;I
<br>
disagree with the part where you say...&quot; have amply shown up the remarks
<br>
about &quot;lemmings&quot; and &quot;political correctness&quot; as flamebait.
<br>

<p>Gratefully yours,

Eliezer Yudkowsky.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, affirmations of one's opinion are essential, not to mention pleasant. I 
<br>
am not embracing the Taleban or Al Qeida or any Wahabbi apparatch-nik as my 
<br>
little buddy(Mustapha's Isle?). 
<br>
<p>Also, so far, I still support the President's apparent attempt to collapse 
<br>
fundamentalist, Islamic guerilla movements, that are violently anti-American. 
<br>
&nbsp;I am also currently, content, to support the nation-state as a viable 
<br>
element of modern life. Surely, with the advent of drexlerian nanotech mass 
<br>
production, or uploading minds, this will change. Yet nothing in material 
<br>
reality has occurred yet. 
<br>
<p>Assuredly, if and when a singularity happens (I am not sure it will be soon) 
<br>
can we base the 'friendliness' of a purported Sysop, on behavior of certain, 
<br>
crucial, people on this list? Would an uploaded or cerebrally-enhanced, 
<br>
spudboy100, really be any wiser, kinder, or more effective then a 
<br>
non-transformed one?  I am not so sure.
<br>
<p>If I or somebody else cannot be more adroit in dealing with others 
<br>
un-transformed, how shall I be when my character flaws are thus enhanced? 
<br>
Till that time, we must deal with the world based upon how it actually is, 
<br>
and back-burner new constitutions for a new age, which has yet to arrive.
