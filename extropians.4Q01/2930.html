<em>&gt; &gt; A gang of thugs cuts a bunch of throats and takes power and Samantha Atkins

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against the laws of nature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Especially since she is completely ignoring that part of the libertarian

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Please pay attention.  We have unilaterally applied force
<br>
illegally in many parts of the world to change many governments
<br>
to our liking. Afghanistan is not the first nor is the current
<br>
action the first time we have intervened in that country. 
<br>
Please give a slight benefit of the doubt if you don't mind.  I
<br>
am saying generally that no country has the right to interfere
<br>
with another sovereign country accept under conditions of war. 
<br>
It is a matter of some contention whether that is quite what we
<br>
have here and now or not.  But it is not a matter of contention,
<br>
afaik, that this is generally conceded to be a principle that
<br>
leads to relative peace between nations.  
<br>
<p>Afghanistan did not attack us.  Terrorists did.  No matter how
<br>
you twist it, there is a bit of a difference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     &gt;More nations have been disrupted and had their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     &gt; governments forcefully destroyed and/or changed by the US using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     &gt; illegal means (our definition of terror) than any other nation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; More than Germany, Japan, China or the USSR?  You really are a jackass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She is only spouting the relativist leftie part line.
</em><br>
<p>I will not be speaking to either one of you.  It is not worth
<br>
it.
