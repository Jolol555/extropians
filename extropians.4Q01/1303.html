<p>Well, I know that Bull had experimented with both liquid, solid, and
<br>
explosive based maneuvering systems in his work at his ranges in Canada
<br>
and Dominica. He also pioneered work on hardened electronics, which
<br>
really isn't that tough: you immerse it in an epoxy much as many
<br>
electronic ballasts are for fluorescent lights, hold it under high
<br>
pressure as it cures. The chamber the electronics sit in are lined with
<br>
a deformation layer that deals with thermal and shock created
<br>
deformation, so this doesn't shatter the 'block'.
<br>
<p>G hardened electronics are not a matter of possibility, merely practice.
<br>
<p>BTW: the big Babylon gun design did not use a single charge, it had
<br>
staggered charges along its length that would go off as the projectile
<br>
passed, thus reducing peak G forces.
