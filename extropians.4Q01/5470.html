<p>&quot;Dated&quot;? You mean unfashionable? You mean inconvenient? You mean

inexpedient?  You think scarcity models are dated? That's a good

<br>
Yes, in some respects, in some areas, scarcity models are not

applicable, but in some areas, like labor, they rule...

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you look at it from a classical economics perspective, which
<br>
is the perspective of the wealthy property owner.  Instead, look at it
<br>
from the perspective of the janitor named Joe  who rents a crummy
<br>
apartment across town from your condo.  Joe's grandparents helped
<br>
build this country. Their votes helped build a stable country that
<br>
attracts capital and investment.  Joe's parents' taxes built the
<br>
infrastructure that attracted capital and investment   One of Joe's
<br>
grandfather's died in WWII, fighting to stop imperialism and enforce
<br>
Pax Americana, which established America as the world's premiere
<br>
superpower and the world's most stable country. America benfitted from
<br>
this--everyone wants to invest their money in the best....
<br>
<p>The company that he works for would rather pay Joe $7/hr with no
<br>
benefits as opposed to the inflation adjusted $11/hr he got in 1978
<br>
(with benefits).  I hope that is no surprise to you...the money not
<br>
paid to Joe and the benefits unpaid mean more money for the executives
<br>
and the stockholders. For them, that added money is a Good Thing.
<br>
The darn problem was that the company got no takers with the low
<br>
wages/no benefit job. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But they still wanted to keep that extra money instead of paying it
<br>
to Joe....now how could they get it? Well, how about this-- they form
<br>
organizations with other businesses where member  pays a little money
<br>
monthly over the years to lobbyists who use the money to do all sorts
<br>
of neat things, such as write press releases, lobby congressmen, and
<br>
spread memes through such avenues as prime time TV and movies.  What
<br>
kinds of memes are spread? Why, memes that will allow them to increase
<br>
the supply of labor, so that Joe will have no choice but to accept the
<br>
$7/hr no benefits jobs. You know why? Because his competition for the
<br>
job are people who come from Mexico where $7 is a whole day's pay.  If
<br>
they can even find a job there. 
<br>
<p>Why is $7/hr unheard of for janitorial work in Mexico? Lots of supply
<br>
of labor, for one.  It's that darn supply-demand equation thing again.
<br>
That silly, outdated thing just won't go away! There are not that many
<br>
jobs in Mexico because investors would rather invest in stable and
<br>
powerful countries like the USA.  They would rather invest in
<br>
countries where the dominant culture reflects accountability and
<br>
honesty (remember I said I was a &quot;culturisy&quot; and not a &quot;racist&quot;?).  So
<br>
therefore there was a demand for labor in the USA, as compared to
<br>
Mexico.  And guess who reaps the rewards of that demand? Our friend,
<br>
Joe the Janitor! Lucky him! His grandparents would be glad to know
<br>
that the country they built has given him a good living.
<br>
<p>But what about those memes being spread by those organized groups of
<br>
businesses and investors? What kind of memes could lower Joe's wages
<br>
by increasing the supply of labor? What kind of memes could persuade a
<br>
reasonable populace to give away the livelihood of all those Joe's out
<br>
there? Well, ya see, ya gotta tap into guilt and shame.  Ya gotta
<br>
*socialize* them, and get to them young, using attractive role models
<br>
to spread those memes.  You pay scriptwriters of sitcoms, and the
<br>
memes are mouthed by toothsome young guys and gals.  Use labels
<br>
like...ummm...&quot;xenophobe&quot;.  (&quot;Xenophobe&quot; is the &quot;commie&quot; of today,
<br>
dontchaknow...).   And ya know, if you keep pounding home those memes,
<br>
you even get little religions sprouting up around them....like
<br>
umm...Comucopianism, and umm...related religions.
<br>
<p>So now those business/investor organizations have got what they
<br>
want--lower wages for all those Joe's (if they can even find a job as
<br>
a janitor.  Which is highly doubtful--over the years I have had many
<br>
many janitors traipse into my office to vacuum and take out the
<br>
trash...every single one has been from Mexico and Central America.  Ya
<br>
see, why hire Joe when you can hire an illegal over whom you have
<br>
leverage?).  Everyone is happy, right? Americans get to help out all
<br>
those poor third worlders with enough money to buy a more varied diet,
<br>
etc.  But what about Joe? Well, he was a little overweight, anyway.
<br>
Too much rich food.  The investors and executives are better able to
<br>
deal with that extra money anyway--what about their Mercedes'
<br>
payments?!   Also, the increased labor supply benefits others besides
<br>
the investors ,etc. Young urban professional get cheaper nannies and
<br>
cheaper prices at the restaurants (some Joe's work as busboys, and
<br>
some Jane's work as nannies...but they were overweight, too...)
<br>
<p>So everyone is happy.  Well...there are a few nasty old contrarians
<br>
that point out that the social contract has been busted--Joe is your
<br>
fellow citizen, and you must value your contract with him and look out
<br>
for him (just as he would look for you) before you go helping people
<br>
in other countries, even though they had nothing to do with building
<br>
the country that provided the environment that provided the jobs in
<br>
the first place, even though Joe's ancestors left this country, the
<br>
country they built, to him, and not to foreigners. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Why, hell, contracts is meant to broke...that's just &quot;bidness,&quot; as
<br>
they say here in Houston....onwards and upwards...
<br>
<p>But is our story finished? Not yet....let's get back to Joe. Well, he
<br>
adapted, he did finally find a job as a janitor...for 7/hr... no
<br>
medical, though. And he lived on rice and beans, and he was happy.
<br>
Until his 53rd year, when he found a lump under his arm.  Well, with
<br>
no benefits, and with no savings (at $7/hr?), Joe succumbed to the
<br>
cancer....and now instead of playing with his grandkids, he has
<br>
returned from whence he came...the dust, and that, my fellow
<br>
worshippers, is a Bad Thing.  He was your fellow citizen, and you
<br>
broke a contract with him.  There will be consequences...eventually.
<br>
There are laws of thermodynamics that apply to societies, as well as
<br>
coffee cups.
<br>
<p>Has my sarcasm penetrated your skull? I doubt it. Better I should take
<br>
the route of the businesses and investors and indoctrinate you over
<br>
the years using bought and paid for mass media....unfortunately, I
<br>
have not those kinds of resources. And really, in almost all
<br>
circumstances, those memes are being spread for PROFIT. That is why
<br>
the money is there in the first place. No free lunch, etc.
<br>
<p>There is no black and white here. Immigration can have benefits.  But
<br>
let's face one thing--the Extropian Institute is actually positioning
<br>
itself as a player in the field of...spreading those darn memes I
<br>
mentioned above....of JUSTIFYING theft of Joe's inherent (penumbral)
<br>
rights of citizenship--namely, and most explicitly, the right to FIRST
<br>
DIBS on whatever work is available to him in the country his
<br>
ancestors.  His right takes precedence over ALL foreigners. Period.
<br>
<p>Maybe I should shut up....maybe the Extropian Institute and the
<br>
principals involved  would use the money garnered therefrom in order
<br>
to spead life extension memes, thereby benefitting me (and, IMO, all
<br>
human beings) in manifold ways.  Or maybe they will use the money to
<br>
buy a Mercedes, who knows....
<br>
<p>But, I am just one of those nasty old contrarians who just LOVE to
<br>
lance the pustulent boils of hypocrisy that infect the buttocks of all
<br>
societies....wow, look at that pus flow....
<br>
<p>[Posted to Extropians mailing list, numerous Usenet newsgroup and my
<br>
state and federal congressman and senators (hey, this is a 2 hour
<br>
rant...I can't just let it rot in the Extropians mailing list...not
<br>
that it will likely do much good anywhere :-)]
<br>
<p>Hey, Joe, this one is for you...my fellow citizen....
