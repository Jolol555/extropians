<em>&gt;From: Amara Graps &lt;<a href="mailto:amara@amara.com?Subject=Re:%20TERRORISM:%20The%20grim%20prospects&In-Reply-To=&lt;200110291527.HAA23209@well.com&gt;">amara@amara.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I've seen some number of articles pointed to on this list about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremist Muslims (not always stated that they are &quot;extremist&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;however). I'm bothered by the imbalance.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Millions of people in the world are Muslims. Even if one allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that some of those people entered that religion under societal or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;family pressures, I think that one can assume that a majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those Muslims entered Islam voluntarily and are gaining some value
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from their religion. Therefore, if so many people are finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;value and support and meaning from their religious world, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like to see a balance of articles about the positive aspects that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their worldview brings to them. I've not seen those in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;articles sent to this list, but only articles about extremist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forms of Islam. Did the newspaper not print them? If not, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that's an interesting tidbit. Why did it not consider it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;sell-worthy news&quot; to print something about the daily (boring but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positive?) life of a Muslim? Did you not see them?
</em><br>
<p>There have been a number of pro-Muslim articles and TV programs
<br>
here on Muslim culture.
<br>
<p>That's the rub, this wasn't supposed to be about Islam, it was
<br>
supposed to be about terrorism, but it most certainly has become
<br>
about Islam, largely because we insist on trying to placate them.
<br>
<p>This has turned into a chance for everyone who doesn't like the
<br>
U.S. to get out their list of grievances, real or imagined.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think that the U.S. needs to respond strongly to the Sept 11
</em><br>
<em>&gt;events, and I feel a lot of sorrow for the victims of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violence and resulting anxieties and fear. However, I hope that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans will evolve above that 'monster' and learn some important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things. Personally, I'm interested in learning the truth about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about bin Laden's motivations, about the different government's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;foreign policies these last few decades, and about the Muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;culture. And I know well that the truth is not something that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can find out by direct means- it will require a large effort to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aware of and understand the different perspectives.
</em><br>
<p>I too think we need to respond strongly, and I'm still waiting for
<br>
it to happen.
<br>
<p>I think we're on the wrong track. I think we're screwing around and
<br>
we need to get serious.
<br>
<p>I know all I need to know about Bin Ladens motives, when he is
<br>
destroyed he will be out of motives.
