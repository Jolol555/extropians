Samantha Atkins a écrit (3.10.2001/10:26) :
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, here is a first point : how can you predict them without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understanding them ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can predict that many hate the US for some of its past and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future actions (not especially for our goodness as some would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to believe).  I can predict more of them will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly desperate and horrific action as we press this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;war&quot; more deeply on their homelands.  
</em><br>
<p><p>But can you predict how they will react if US leave Saoudi Arabia, for
<br>
example ? Think of the talk here about not depending on oil anymore.
<br>
How much of a solution will that be ? What about Israel ? Will US have
<br>
to abandon Israel, too, to satisfy their sense of justice ? And if US
<br>
leave Saoudi, and Israel becomes New Israel somewhere in Utah (as
<br>
someone suggested <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/kinsella5.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/kinsella5.html</a> ),
<br>
will they be happy, then ? Or will they go on to a further
<br>
establishment of justice, by attacking us ?
<br>
<p>I don't see how you can predict these things without understanding
<br>
what their claims are, what they feel deep inside, and what they want.
<br>
<p>There are 2 things to consider for the prediction : what they want,
<br>
and what they can actually achieve. Now, and in the future. And
<br>
obviously, how many of them, how well organized, how well supported,
<br>
they will be, and this amounts to understanding the links between them
<br>
and between more general cultural-social-religious perceptions in
<br>
these countries.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That misses my points.  But I do not believe Islam is itself as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; central as oppression, injustice and victims lashing out against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who they see as the oppressor any way that they can.  Islam, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather the more militant edge of it, is relevant but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe it is the most central for understanding the story.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is easier for many to do amateur &quot;analysis&quot; of Islam and blame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam than come to grips
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with guilt and culpability on our as well as &quot;their&quot; side.
</em><br>
<p><p>Samantha, I see the following problem : you are so willing to be fair
<br>
and moral, and to face your own (collective) responsability, that you
<br>
think that everything depends on it.
<br>
<p>It's like tomorrow is Judgement Day, and nothing else matters.
<br>
<p>But if you see what's in their head, then you will probably see that
<br>
not everything they require match what you are willing to give. That
<br>
things that you are ashamed that the US did, they mock as tame and
<br>
coward. That things that you would like to see establish for justice,
<br>
they reject totally.
<br>
<p>But talking about &quot;justice&quot;... what is it ?
<br>
<p>Isn't justice the respect of the rights of an individual belonging to
<br>
a community, the rights being given by the rule of the community ?
<br>
<p>So what's the community we are part of with bin Laden ? Did we agree
<br>
on anything together ?
<br>
<p>We can talk about justice when we agree on something. Trying to agree
<br>
will bring out what both parties want, and we will see if it's
<br>
compatible. If so, we will commit to something, and respect it with
<br>
justice.
<br>
<p>In the mean time, focusing on the fact that &quot;we must respect justice&quot;
<br>
in order to solve the problem doesn't strike me as a terrifically
<br>
sound approach.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Ben Laden is not mad, not evil, not coward (I don't know him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personnally, but at least it doesn't appear to be). But he is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ENNEMY (read his &quot;Declaration of war against the Americans&quot; in case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you have any doubt). Do you need to morally diminish your ennemy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acknowledge him as such ? Of course not !
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will we make him and others like him less an enemy by bombing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hell out of large sections of the Mid East that we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already been screwing with in often horrendous ways for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades?  Very doubtful.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, if you kill your ennemy, he does stop to be your ennemy in some
<br>
important sense.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Will it help our reaching Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to engage in such hypocritical posturings as &quot;Infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Justice&quot;.  Hell no.
</em><br>
<p><p>I agree on this.
<br>
<p>It seems that the names have a &quot;tactic&quot; meaning, and are not directed
<br>
to the public but to the ennemy himself. But as it is publicized, it
<br>
leaves much to be desired.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; You may object that this way of thinking tends to polarize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; situation, by accepting that &quot;good&quot; guys can be our ennemies, and be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fullfilling prophecy avoiding that we build a harmonious world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; together, with all the good guys, by explaining them that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wrong to act as they do, and that by just adapting a little their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behaviour, we can consider them as really good guy and not &quot;very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evil-mad&quot; good guy. But that which you may overlook, is that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't give a damn of your &quot;harmony&quot; and your &quot;sense of justice&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is just degenerated christian-atheist nonsense. For them, justice is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't disagree at all and see some point in being clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly. But I still think whether we judge the terrorist as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cowards or courageous is a side-show to the main questions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues.  We are hypocrites to hate these terrorist when our CIA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has done much worse in many countries, toppled and created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire regimes, engaged in torture, terrorizing civilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; populations and so on.  Any &quot;solution&quot; that does not admit our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own dirty deeds and work toward stopping our own real terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a very dangerous cover-up and scapegoating.  Was what was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done to the WTC and Pentagon wrong?  Of course.  But was it also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a seriously aggreivated wrong from our own past actions?   I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the answer again has to be affirmative.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think this way of thinking shows you want to be fair, and to have a
<br>
morally good conduct. This is of course something good. However, as I
<br>
said above, there is a danger in thinking that everything depends on
<br>
what you do, and on its position on your moral scale. There happen to
<br>
be other people, with specific world views and agenda, very remote
<br>
from yours.
