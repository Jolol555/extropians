<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The answer is no. Look at communism, Robert. Communism didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fragment until a number of other conditions were met (probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the Cold War didn't help much to support the &quot;information wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to be free&quot; meme, either)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It isn't clear to me precisely what caused communism to fragment.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure either. When I started traveling to the Baltics in
<br>
1989 (two years before the coup), the 'independence movement' was
<br>
already in a fairly advanced stage. The largest change that I could
<br>
see was the freedom of speech. The folks there could speak in their
<br>
homes, in their cars, on the central plazas carrying long
<br>
monologues. Wow. No bugging. Dissidents were speaking as they had
<br>
before, but this time, they weren't getting arrested. Large
<br>
demonstrations had already been successfully carried out (which were
<br>
peaceful, no arrests).
<br>
<p>I don't think that Gorbachev was paying too close attention to
<br>
Baltic corner, or to the other little countries which were flexing
<br>
their independence muscles. He had his hands full with the fighting
<br>
between the Azerbajanis and the Armenians. By the summer of 1991,
<br>
the different ethnic groups were visibly defying the Kremlin by
<br>
flying their own ethnic flags on the flagpoles instead of the hammer
<br>
and sickle flag.
<br>
<p>A huge amount of international press focused on Riga and Vilnius in
<br>
the early part of 1991, eight months before the coup (and the USSR
<br>
Fall) during several bloody confrontations with the OMON (Black
<br>
Berets). In that confrontation, some people, who were protecting the
<br>
local government buildings (where newly elected noncommunists were
<br>
running the regions) with only sticks, were killed by the OMON,
<br>
which further helped the Balts because they presented a sympathetic
<br>
image to the outside world. And who where these new local
<br>
politicians? The most vocal was a musical composer named Landsbergis
<br>
who was the first from the USSR to declare Lithuania to be an
<br>
independent country.
<br>
<p>I know that Gorbachev wanted to open up the Soviet Union a bit.
<br>
However, I don't think that he wanted to lose the whole country, and
<br>
I don't think that he expected the independence movements to gain
<br>
hold as thoroughly as it did, and as quickly as it did, and he lost
<br>
control.
<br>
<p>This is about what I saw from the 'inside' from personal experience,
<br>
but I'm curious to know more about the communism fragmenting process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; What are your goals here? To push U.S. ideology in conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like that?  If you want to use force to push U.S. ideology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; through their baren soil, then I won't help you.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't believe in pushing any idealogy other than the one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people should be free and some form of a democratic government is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better than an oppressive government not chosen by a majority of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people.  I might want to push the concept of fundamental human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights, along the lines of U.N. treaties (I haven't read them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;detail to be sure I fully agree with them).
</em><br>
<p>I would personally like to see people at least as free as me.
<br>
However, I have a big problem with 'pushing'. If I had some evidence
<br>
that people in an open and accessible region were eager to expand
<br>
their freedoms, then I would be happy to be there with a portable
<br>
xerox machine, copying pages from _Road to Serfdom_, _The Machinery
<br>
of Freedom_, and _Capitalism and Freedom_, for example. But I
<br>
wouldn't send troops to break into a country to distribute these
<br>
ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I believe that only 2 countries in the world had relations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.  I think that says
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a *lot* about the number of people who generally thought we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were better off without that group.
</em><br>
<p>Would you send in the military for that reason? The U.S. was one of
<br>
the countries since 1945 to *not* recognize the USSR as the legal
<br>
government overriding Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Would you have
<br>
sent in the U.S. military because it (rightly) recognized that a
<br>
very nasty government was in control there? What do you think is the
<br>
right reason to send in troops and start bombing another country?
<br>
<p>One must know the difference between helping (for example, give a
<br>
people some potentially useful information), and between acting as
<br>
if everyone should 'be like me' and 'want what I have'.
<br>
<p>Back to meme-set conflicts: I suspect that you and I have different
<br>
tolerance levels for 'pushing' memes. I simply don't because I
<br>
consider even 'little' as coersive. My solution instead is the
<br>
metaphorical 'plant seeds' or I choose to be an example.
<br>
<p>Finally, regarding 'pacifism': I choose my actions that benefit me.
<br>
In the unsafe situations which I have been in the last years,
<br>
this particular practice has benefitted me (far more than hurt me)
<br>
so there's no need for me to pay attention to what philosphers say.
<br>
(BTW, pacifism does not equal passive).
