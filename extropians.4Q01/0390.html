Brain fingerprinting: What you thought, what I meant
<br>
David Coursey
<br>
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/stories/story/0,10738,2816429,00.html">http://www.zdnet.com/anchordesk/stories/story/0,10738,2816429,00.html</a>
<br>
The name: &quot;Brain Fingerprinting&quot; is a particularly unfortunate name that
<br>
suggests an ability to somehow gather the contents of someone's brain for
<br>
identification. It is also painfully close to &quot;brain washing.&quot; For this
<br>
discussion, I will propose a more accurate, descriptive term: &quot;Threat
<br>
Recognition Testing,&quot; or when used in criminal investigations, &quot;Evidence
<br>
Recognition Testing.&quot;
<br>
<p>What the test looks for: Threat Recognition Testing seeks to determine whether
<br>
the subject being tested recognizes certain items--which may be images of
<br>
physical items, pictures, or terminology. If the subject being tested
<br>
recognizes enough specific items, he or she can be assumed to have certain
<br>
training or experience. In actual testing, the technique was used to find 100
<br>
percent of the FBI agents in a test group without falsely selecting civilians
<br>
as FBI agents.
<br>
<p>How was this done: The subjects were shown words and images that only an FBI
<br>
agent would recognize. The non-FBI agents did not recognize these images and
<br>
words.
<br>
<p>How the test works: Subjects are hooked up to a device that measures brain
<br>
activity (the cerebral equivalent of a heart monitor) and shown a series of
<br>
images. An image or word the person recognizes presents a distinct brainwave
<br>
pattern when compared with an unrecognized image or word. The person cannot
<br>
consciously control this response.
<br>
<p>The test does not care who you are, where you are from, your gender, religious
<br>
beliefs--anything other than whether you recognize a specific word or image.
<br>
All of the words and images can be given to the subject in advance without
<br>
affecting the test result.
<br>
<p>When good people recognize bad things: It is obvious that a bank robber and an
<br>
FBI agent who investigates bank robberies would recognize many of the same
<br>
things. For that reason, additional images can be presented to subjects in
<br>
order to more precisely understand the context in which an object is
<br>
recognized. In an interactive testing system, this could be done
<br>
automatically, with the test adapting itself to probe more deeply into areas
<br>
of concern.
<br>
<p>Does the test &quot;read&quot; someone's mind? The test does not determine what someone
<br>
is thinking, or even whether they are lying or not. It does, however,
<br>
determine if a person recognizes specific things. The test does not plant any
<br>
ideas or images into the subject's mind.
<br>
<p>Here's an example of how the test might be used: Take one murder suspect, add
<br>
images only the murderer would know--faces of victims, locations, weapons,
<br>
etc.--and you should be able to separate the innocent from the potentially
<br>
guilty pretty quickly.
<br>
<p>In a terrorist-screening scenario, you'd look for recognition of items related
<br>
to terrorist training and organizations. Score enough positives and you'd
<br>
become very interesting to the authorities.
<br>
<p>This is not a technique for discovering things like whether you cheat on your
<br>
taxes or spouse (or both). It also won't tell whether you are a Republican,
<br>
Democrat, or something else, though it could determine whether you attended
<br>
one of the parties' national conventions (by testing you on what you would
<br>
have seen there).
<br>
<p>The strengths: The test is excellent at clearing the innocent and, properly
<br>
given, can determine, if not always guilt, then at least what knowledge a
<br>
subject possesses, allowing for further investigation. The testing is
<br>
computerized, could require no human intervention, and is not racially,
<br>
ethnically, or culturally biased. Testing could take as little as 10 minutes,
<br>
but could be expanded to cover more items, thus adding the detail necessary to
<br>
separate security risks from non-risks.
<br>
<p>The limitations: This technology has been tested and accepted by courts,
<br>
though additional testing certainly makes sense. There are also some technical
<br>
hurdles which today make the technique more suited for longer testing of
<br>
specific individuals (suspects) than quick testing of the general public
<br>
(screening).
<br>
<p>This specifically relates to the devices used to record brain activity. With
<br>
digital signal processing, it should be possible to improve the
<br>
signal-to-noise ratio (which shortens the time needed for testing). Actually
<br>
creating the tests is a non-trivial matter, especially when screening for
<br>
potential problems rather than investigating an actual crime or incident.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
