<em>&gt; No such claims or goals exist with government-sponsored research.

</em><br>
<p>I think this is only rhetorically so.  I.e., the rhetoric is for advancement
<br>
of the truth, etc.  The reality is something different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although I do think that in practice there is a bias, at least in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politically-oriented research, I think that Machan somewhat misstates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nature of the bias in government funding by comparing it to business.
</em><br>
<p>What about the squelching of research into racial and ethnic differences?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This analogy would suggest that political researchers would be influenced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to support current government policies.  Today they would be expected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to promote Republican economic policies and support the war effort.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily.  It would depend on a few factors and there is a lag in any
<br>
organization.  As soon as Bush was elected, e.g., not all professors from
<br>
UCB to NYU who didn't toe the GOP line were fired.  Also, even though Bush
<br>
is in office, his economic policies -- which are basically welfare statist
<br>
period (he's not talking about abolishing the New Deal or the FRS only
<br>
quibbling over some minor details) -- have had little impact on the colleges
<br>
as of yet.  I don't see him or anyone in his administration cutting the
<br>
monies to them or to fundamentally shifting policies.
<br>
<p>Nor are the Republicans in charge of everything.  Even when the so called
<br>
radicals in that party did have some power -- after the 1994 Congressional
<br>
elections -- this was short-lived AND the moderates (liberal, big government
<br>
Republicans) were still the majority of the party from House to shining
<br>
House.  (As they used to say back then, Bob Dole (Senate Majority Leader
<br>
between 1994 and 1998) never met a take he didn't hike.:)  Now, the
<br>
situation is much less this way.  There are hardly any radicals, most of
<br>
that party is moderate (even more so in the cases of ex-NYC Mayor Rudy
<br>
Guiliani and now EPA boss Whitman), and the Democrats control the Senate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But in fact this is not the sort of bias we see.  Academics generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are liberals, much more so than Republicans, and in most cases even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more so than mainstream Democratic governments.  The academy is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most left-leaning of major American institutions, retaining considerable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers of socialists and quasi-communists even as these ideologies have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed in the real world.
</em><br>
<p>Some would argue this is so mostly because the Left has controlled academia
<br>
for so long.  Kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy too.  If the Left now
<br>
controls higher learning -- and has for about a a century -- who do you
<br>
think they are going to give tenure, hire, and so on?  A friend of mine,
<br>
Chris, who majored in political science at Rutgers University during the
<br>
early 1990s told me, e.g., that every paper he wrote for a certain professor
<br>
had to have a Marxist tinge in order to get a decent grade.  Chris was
<br>
basically a libertarian at the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Academics generally do not work to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government policies.  The people who fund research have no expectation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the work will advance the causes of whatever government is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in power.  The situation is quite different from much industrial research.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this is completely true.  Academics often originate policy AND
<br>
they impact their students who then go on to become journalists,
<br>
politicians, and the like.  The influence might not be immediate, but it's
<br>
there.  Again, there might be a lag but a loose connection is not
<br>
disconnection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What we do see, as Machan's examples show, is a more familiar form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of bias: self-interest.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, and companies that support research do this for the same reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Academics generally support policies which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will benefit the academy.  They are leftist supporters of even bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments, a policy which would funnel even more funds into academic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research.
</em><br>
<p>I think Rightists have shown the same tendency.  Most Republicans might talk
<br>
about smaller government, but when it comes to their favorite programs --
<br>
defense, police, global intervention, support of Israel, and, now, faith
<br>
based charities -- why there's plenty of room in their worldview for big
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>But your point seems generally true.  However, you overlook one thing.  A
<br>
lot of public research is done at the behest of private companies.  Thus, at
<br>
Rutgers University, e.g., we see the major pharmaceuticals given some
<br>
funding for projects, but getting the public to fund the rest.  This is
<br>
nothing more than corporate welfare -- albeit done in such a fashion that
<br>
few criticize it.  What do you think the impact of this system of wealth
<br>
transfer would have on academics?  Would they be for the free market or
<br>
government-business partnerships?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They object to Machan's libertarianism, not because it is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposition to the policies of the funders, for their own research is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well; but because, if put into effect, it would cut off their own funding.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the two as separate.  That the self-interest of tenured
<br>
academics alligns with certain ideologies and not others seems to show that
<br>
such groups self-select their members.  In other words, they supoort
<br>
policies which help them out AND those who are already inclined to their
<br>
policies become their members.  I don't think the average someone falls into
<br>
higher education if they don't already believe these things are good.  (In
<br>
the same way, most politicians want what?  Power!  But the pool of people
<br>
who want to go into politics already believe government is the solution, so
<br>
most of them are not for a reduction in governmental or their own power.
<br>
It's not like hardcore libertarians make it to office, then discover, &quot;Hey,
<br>
if I abolish this or that agency, I'll have less power&quot; and transform into
<br>
welfare-state careerists.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, self-interest is the primal human emotion and there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no funding mechanism which will eliminate this effect.  If we did have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private funding of research, eventually researchers would take on an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideological bias in favor of that method which would be just as bad as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the present system.  If we went to some of the more radical proposals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as Robin's Idea Futures, bias would be present as well.
</em><br>
<p>Then you have to ask yourself, which system produces the least bias against
<br>
the truth AND which system is more likely to provide a dynamic environment
<br>
to pursue the truth.  You already know what I think about this -- or you've
<br>
been sleeping.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
