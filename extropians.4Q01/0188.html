<p>It isn't in decay Daniel, the metalization of the galaxy is actually
<br>
a very good thing for advanced technological civilizations.  You can't
<br>
build a heck of a lot out of H/He/Li.  He dislocations in frozen H
<br>
as data storage cubes or perhaps monoatomic H in frozen He as a
<br>
rocket propellant are about the best things I can think of.
<br>
<p>One of the reasons we may still see stars is because the could
<br>
perhaps be the best breeder reactors available at this time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, it is a bacteria. Bacteria overall are much hardier than most more

<p><em>&gt;From what I understand of the Deinococcus radiodurans DNA repair

strategy it isn't that hard to copy it.  They are much more tolerant
<br>
of double strand breaks (allowing hundreds per cell vs. humans 2-3),
<br>
then they are polyploidal and use homologous recombination to manage
<br>
the repair of the DSB (in contrast human cells undergo apoptosis in
<br>
an anti-cancer strategy).  I suspect DNA repair strategies are tuned
<br>
by each species to balance the need to survive and reproduce with
<br>
the need to allow some evolution to occur.  There could be a wide
<br>
variety of molecular foundations for life that are much more radiation
<br>
tolerant than our DNA based strategy is.

<p>Rafal, I've done some calculations on this for my Matrioshka Brain
<br>
work (<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/</a>).
<br>
<p>Using 1% of the material available in our solar system (without
<br>
star-lifting) you can build 100 billion lunar diameter telescopes.
<br>
It would fill an area out to the orbit of Jupiter (which is why
<br>
occultation astronomy is a reasonable way to search for signs of
<br>
ATC -- such a large array would cause fairly frequent occultations
<br>
of the stars behind it).  You can certainly see back to the beginning
<br>
of the universe and view planets around stars in your corner of the
<br>
galaxy and perhaps even nearby galaxies.  More importantly you can
<br>
probably do almost real time monitoring of all the stars in your
<br>
galaxy.  Feeding their orbital information into one very large chunk
<br>
of computronium allows you to do a many-many-body calculation for
<br>
the least expensive path (in terms of mass/energy expenditure required
<br>
to alter course) through the galaxy to avoid anticipated future
<br>
hazards.
<br>
<p>The point about avoiding radiation due to impacts on the magnetosphere
<br>
and possible loss of hydrogen does seem moderately important though.
<br>
However, it looks like there may be a lot of &quot;water worlds&quot; out there
<br>
and so one could argue that occasional magnetosphere disruptions could
<br>
actually be a good thing since the H loss would likely eventually bring
<br>
some of the ocean floor above sea level.
