<p>
Far, far away, on the other side of the Milky Way Galaxy,
<br>
there's a beautiful planet called Dumbtopia.
<br>
<p>Dumbtopia's inhabitants are called Idiots.
<br>
<p>They believe in a Supernatural creature they call
<br>
Skybless.
<br>
<p>Dumbtopia is divided into Dumbcountries -- at least,
<br>
that's what the Idiots believe. They sporadically fight
<br>
and slaughter each other over some skyblessforsaken
<br>
patch of land -- &quot;For Skybless and Dumbcountry.&quot;
<br>
<p>Apparently, each Dumbcountry is ruled by a Plusidiot.
<br>
Plusidiots are wiser than Idiots because they have
<br>
blue blood -- or so they say. Common Idiots have red
<br>
blood and believe that Plusidiots are their Superiors.
<br>
<p>Apparantly. each Plusidiot has a Dumbcouncil to help
<br>
rule the common Idiots. Plusidiots have a secret magic
<br>
drink called Etherwise. They give it to selected Idiots
<br>
to drink. It makes their heads spin. After they've been
<br>
drinking Etherwise for about a month, they experience
<br>
Dumbliss, become Halfwits, and qualify to serve on
<br>
Dumbcouncils.
<br>
<p>Plusidiots and Halfwits pretend to have the ability to
<br>
speak and write magic words called Pluswords --
<br>
Pluws for short. Common Idiots believe that Pluws
<br>
are special holy words that must be obeyed. To
<br>
make sure this dumb belief sticks, Plusidiots
<br>
employ Dumbcops to punish and kill Idiots who
<br>
&quot;disobey The Pluw.&quot;
<br>
<p>Many common Idiots campaign to &quot;Improve the
<br>
holy Pluws.&quot;
<br>
<p>Every hundred years or so, as a result of an unusual
<br>
evolutionary mutation, some common Idiot wakes
<br>
up and realizes that all the political systems on
<br>
Dumbtopia are hoaxes and frauds. The woken-up
<br>
Idiot then suggests that Plusidiots really have red
<br>
blood, just like all common Idiots, and that there's
<br>
nothing special about so-called &quot;Plusidiots&quot; and
<br>
&quot;Halfwits&quot; -- they're really common Idiots like
<br>
everybody else.
<br>
<p>As soon as the Dumbcops discover a woken-up
<br>
Idiot, they kill him or her. &quot;Skybless help us if the
<br>
Idiots ever discover that so-called &quot;Plusidiots&quot; and
<br>
&quot;Halfwits&quot; are really impostors and liars -- common
<br>
Idiots like all the rest -- and that their pretended
<br>
&quot;Pluws&quot; are hoaxes... strings of dumb lies written
<br>
by Idiots!&quot;
