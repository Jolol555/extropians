<p>There's that word again.  I wish people would stop using &quot;we&quot; here.  None of
<br>
you were part of making these decisions back then.  This rampant
<br>
collectivism is part of the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; had agreed, one of the many conditions the Japanese insisted on was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no occupation of the mainland so the military would still run things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A perfect set up for another US Japanese war about 1950.
</em><br>
<p>If you're going to do counterfactual history here, at least focus more on
<br>
Japan's internal politics.  By 1945, the Japanese military was damaged
<br>
beyond repair.  At home, I'm sure this would have meant non-military and
<br>
non-militaristic factions reasserting control.  (Notably, this happened in
<br>
Argentina after the Falkland Islands War and in Germany late in WW1
<br>
(militarists lost power in the government there).)
<br>
<p>In fact, part of the reason the militarists got power in the first place was
<br>
because of FDR's heavy handed diplomacy with Japan.  (This is only part, but
<br>
it was probably decisive for starting a war between the US and Japan.)
<br>
<p>BTW, most nations, societies, and even chess clubs are like this.  They
<br>
don't all march lockstep.  Treating them like they do can lead to things
<br>
like total war.  (Total war is costly, in terms of lives and extropy.  To
<br>
destroy a society obviously creates more entropy, but in order to accomplish
<br>
that the destructor society often has to create massive amounts of entropy
<br>
internally, such as the economic disorder created in the US by the wartime
<br>
economy.)
<br>
<p>So, I don't think Japan would have been ready to go to war again in five
<br>
years.  Add to this, it took until the early 1950s for Japan's economy to
<br>
really start cranking again -- after the price controls and such of the
<br>
occupation were lifted.  I doubt a war ravaged Japan would have been able to
<br>
rise from the ashes to threaten America.  Also, Japan's traditional enemies,
<br>
China and Korea, would be more likely targets of any reawaekened imperial
<br>
ambitions.  By 1950, I doubt Japan would have been able to attack a united
<br>
and militarized PRC.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose we hadn't agreed but didn't use the bomb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Soviets declared war of Japan soon after these feelers so if the war
</em><br>
didn't end
<br>
<em>&gt; mighty damn quick you'd now have a poor communist totalitarian North Japan
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; a rich capitalistic South Japan just as you have in Korea. Neither is a
</em><br>
happy prospect.
<br>
<p>The Soviets were too busy grabbing Manchuria to start an invasion of Japan
<br>
itself.  (They only attacked where Japan was weak.)  Even though they manage
<br>
to grab a few Northern Islands, don't you think this contradicts your thesis
<br>
about saving American lives?  Would the Japanese be able to fend off an
<br>
American invasion but not a Soviet one?  This seems even less likely given
<br>
that the Soviet Union was not as good at amphibious warfare during most of
<br>
its existence, especially during World War Two.  (The Soviet ally North
<br>
Korea was hit by a massive amphibious assault by American forces in 1950
<br>
which lead to its almost total defeat until the Chinese got into the Korean
<br>
War.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I said before however I do with they'd waited a few days before they
</em><br>
bombed Nagasaki
<br>
<p>Granted, though I've read Tojo actually didn't care about the atomic bomb
<br>
drops.  He wanted to dig in and fight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You are narrowing the options down to bomb or invade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If the US had sought _conditional surrender_, an invasion and subsequent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; might not have been necessary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The US got a conditional surrender, not in name but in deed, it allowed
</em><br>
Japan to
<br>
<em>&gt; keep the Emperor.
</em><br>
<p>True, though this was a minor, last minute concession.  The point is the war
<br>
was prosecuted up until that point with the stated goal of unconditional
<br>
surrender.  Until the actual surrender took place, this is what both sides
<br>
understood.  (Notably, too, Emperor Hirohito's reassertion of control -- in
<br>
other words, taking command from the Tojo faction -- that led to the
<br>
surrender.  Again, Japan was not a monolith, then or even now.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The US had peace feelers of its own, they responded with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a word in Japanese that can be interpreted as &quot;decline to answer at this
</em><br>
time&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; or as &quot;too contemptible to answer&quot; or as simply &quot;silence&quot;. To this day
</em><br>
even the
<br>
<em>&gt; Japanese argue about what they meant. It seems to me that with thousands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dying every day it was their responsibility to eliminate baffle gab.
</em><br>
<p>Without an invasion, how would more US soldiers have died?  Surely, the
<br>
Japanese still had troops in China and elsewhere.  Is that what you mean?
<br>
Explain...
<br>
<p>Cheers!
