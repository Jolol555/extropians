<p>2 a : the element or complex of elements in an individual that feels,

perceives, thinks, wills, and especially reasons

[should be replaced by &lt;brain&gt;]
<br>
<p>### Somehow, &quot;brain&quot;, as a physical object is in some contexts not the thing
<br>
we refer to when we talk about the mind. The brain is the carrier for the
<br>
mind, which is the totality of subjective experience.
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
b : the mental events and capabilities in an organism
<br>
[the term &lt;cognitive behavior&gt; covers this]
<br>
<p>### Again, &quot;cognitive behavior&quot; refers merely to the objectively observable
<br>
correlates of subjective events, as any conscious human will tell you. I
<br>
hope you are not a Skinnerian.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Where is the empirical evidence for this mystical entity
<br>
that you call &quot;mind&quot;? 
<br>
<p>### Please define your meaning of &quot;empirical&quot; here.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>It sounds more like a religious meme or a belief system,
<br>
and is reminiscent of the ghost in the machine. It is equivalent to
<br>
phlogiston
<br>
and vitalism as a useless hypothesis.
<br>
<p>### Phlogiston as a hypothesis was useless mainly because it failed to give
<br>
falsifiable predictions, AFAIK. Vitalism was abandoned once its predictions
<br>
were experimentally disproved (Wohler's synthesis of urea).
<br>
<p>The mind is, broadly speaking, a name for the subjective experience of
<br>
thinking (at least this is how I use the word) and it is assumed as a given
<br>
in any discussion between sentient entities. If you were able to present
<br>
empirical evidence that you have no subjective states, merely behaviors, I
<br>
might be willing to reconsider my position - since you deny one of the
<br>
axioms, the burden of proof of its uselessnes is on you.

<p> Thanks but no thanks. I have no use for
such outdated and un-extropic conjecture.
<p>### Un-extropic?
