<em>&gt; Please explain this inconsistency, or explain where I err. If cops are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _better_ than people, then we have an example of someone who has that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magic I asked about in my Q5. Don't we?
</em><br>
<p>I don't feel really safe with armed cops either, but better than with 
<br>
civilians carrying guns. Why? Because here, the cops get a year long 
<br>
training, psychological supervision and are much less motivated to draw 
<br>
their gun (because they don't need to, cf. our statistics). If a cop here 
<br>
kills an innocent person, he will get into deep trouble.
<br>
<p>I do not feel safe with untrained, underpayed, fearful uniform wearing 
<br>
security personnel...
<br>
<p>My vision is to live in a society where everyone finds it absurd to carry a 
<br>
gun - too heavy, too uncomfortable, too dangerous and simply unnecessary. 
<br>
And don't tell me that's impossible. We are discussing infinite 
<br>
life-extension, mind uploading and nanotechnology here, so what about a 
<br>
little extropian sociology, hm?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; See, I don't accept that a free and liberal society has to be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dangerous that their citizens only feel safe when they carry a deadly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weapon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are in utter agreement on this point, as written. There are a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grand generalizations in it, though, so I can tell you that it's my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling that I have never lived in such a society as you describe, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think I never shall.
</em><br>
<p>I see. Do you carry a gun? Why? How would you feel without it? Why?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hear reports that there are _some_ highschools where _some_ students
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are criminals who carry firearms, and there are _other_ (scared) students
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who carry their own in response. This in no way pleases me, and I wish I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could change it. That is at present beyond my powers. It sucks.
</em><br>
<p>You mean, rather than solving the problem, you try to cure the symptoms by 
<br>
spreading the desease? May be I am to european to find this a very logical 
<br>
way...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And yes, there are some bad places in the US, and yes, it sucks that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are.
</em><br>
<p>Fine, that's the analysis. And what are you or anyone over there going to 
<br>
do against it? More weapons? An escalation of arms development? Leading to 
<br>
what? A singularity of weapons? Hm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I have heard this argument before: &quot;The minorities&quot; are far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; violent and criminal than the rest. [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Minorities being more unhappy, or violent, or criminal, is a really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex topic. I don't feel qualified to discuss it, and so I don't bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it up.
</em><br>
<p>Pardon, but we will not come very far with &quot;Dünnbrettbohren&quot; (avoiding 
<br>
complex topics).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Someone also suggested that the reason for the different crime rates is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the inhomogeneity(?) of the US society compared to a more homogeneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Europe. Hm. But the &quot;majority&quot; also consists of former minorities, here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as well as in the US, correct? Unless you propose that the &quot;new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minorities&quot; are intrinsically more violent than the &quot;old&quot;, what magic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; turned a mixture of minorities into a homogeneous, peaceful, law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abiding majority?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't answer that, since I am not confident of the premise and never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claimed the premise as mine.
</em><br>
<p>Too bad. I thought this could be a promising way of discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A loaded gun is just a couple of ounces of low explosive wrapped in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metal. I know you could go to a hardware store and make one for $10, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is nothing I can do about it, so I live my life confident that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are probably part of the 99.99%, absent obvious clues to the contrary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For you, though, it seems as if there's a problem once anyone thinks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about having a gun.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. Because here where I live, the majority of citizens feel at least 
<br>
so safe that a gun is a symbol of violence, rather than necessary 
<br>
self-defense. Maybe difficult to explain. We are not used to guns because 
<br>
we don't have to *shrug*
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A fair question. I have no final answer. I agree the question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important, and am happy to see that we agree. 
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt; A very good question. I wish you luck and courage in finding an answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that satisfies you.
</em><br>
<p>Do you really try to sneak away so soon? Now, what about the glorious 
<br>
future of &lt;you-name-it&gt; technology, when you can't use it because someone 
<br>
could misuse it to kill you?
