But the news has been leaked to the British public:

<p>excerpt:
<br>
The much-hyped first American ground attack on Afghanistan ran into 
<br>
unexpectedly fierce resistance and almost ended in disaster, senior defence 
<br>
sources have disclosed.
<br>
<p>The public admissions by Donald Rumsfeld, the US Secretary of State for 
<br>
Defence, and US Navy Rear Admiral John Stufflebeem that they were surprised 
<br>
by the toughness of the Taliban gives a glimpse of how badly things could 
<br>
have gone wrong.
<br>
<p>The attack was meant to be a purely cosmetic exercise for the benefit of the 
<br>
media and the public against a relatively safe and poorly defended target.
<br>
<p>But there had been a failure of intelligence, and the troops from the elite 
<br>
75th Rangers Regiment ran into such heavy fire on the ground near Kandahar 
<br>
that they had to beat a hasty retreat. A Chinook helicopter airlifting them 
<br>
out lost its undercarriage and had to make a forced landing.
