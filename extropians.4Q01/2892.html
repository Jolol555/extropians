</em><br>
<p>Actually, most air bases have salvage operations that regularly auction
<br>
and retail surplus equipment of all kinds to not just other government
<br>
agencies and non-profits, but to private citizens as well. There is
<br>
typically a one or two day a month scheduled public auction at the
<br>
Material Reuse office.
<br>
<p>For instance, any air crash wreckage will eventually wind up at the
<br>
Material Reuse office, to be auctioned off as scrap.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; decade or so.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that the Material Reuse offices at many locations will sign
<br>
contracts with surplus jobbers to deal with it for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt;I believe that de Seversky worked for the Sikorsky corp. You've gotta
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;use balsa, mylar, and very fine wire. I was planning on a wireless power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;transmission device to free it from the umbilical cord eventually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mine were balsa and thin copper wire. Of course, i was only 11 at the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I should try this again...
</em><br>
<p>Copper is a no-no. I used very fine steel wire. It can withstand any
<br>
static discharges better than the copper and doesn't sag with use. Since
<br>
the thrust is generated by the electrostatic field developed, you need
<br>
to work with the spacing of the wire to minimize weight and optimize
<br>
field spread.
<br>
<p>I built it with four triangular cells in a square layout, each cell
<br>
having a bit of dihedral and powered independently through a joystick
<br>
governor device that varied the voltage to each cell based on the
<br>
joystick input so that it could be maneuvered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you could use the HERF gun to power the ionocraft through an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on-board rectenna - but HV diodes in the voltages needed are NOT tiny - or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly light...
</em><br>
<p>No, they aren't, which is why you'd want to build a larger model, say
<br>
about 3' square or more. It scales to be more effective with size since
<br>
it's actually a field device with low current, you want to build up the
<br>
field with the lightest supply device possible, and you get higher
<br>
thrust with higher voltage. The smallest power supply you can make with
<br>
off the shelf parts can actually supply a rather large model. Building
<br>
up the field is like filling a balloon with hot air. Once you reach a
<br>
certain point, you only need to maintain its buoyancy.
