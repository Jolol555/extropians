<p>A very sly and enjoyable remark, but then Sappho didn't know about the
<br>
forthcoming chosen death of our beloved and divine savior Jesus, or the
<br>
death of other prophets (peace be upon them), which show how altogether
<br>
acceptable this practice is to the One True God, even unto His Own death
<br>
and resurrection (but with a guaranteed proviso like that I wouldn't mind
<br>
either).
<br>
<p>I was wondering, as a thought experiment (ie I don't expect it to be
<br>
literally the case) how people generally would react if it were discovered
<br>
that senescence and death are the indirect result of a nearly universal
<br>
prion infection. 
<br>
<p>In the absence of this malign form of a common structural protein, our
<br>
maintenance systems would remain highly effective indefinitely, but in most
<br>
higher organisms the prion builds up from childhood and after 20 years or
<br>
so (like other `slow viruses') has progressively done enough damage to
<br>
prevent us from fixing our damaged cells. Evolution worked around this
<br>
contingent fact by selecting for other pleitropic characters promoting
<br>
heightened early fitness/health even at the cost of later damage, since the
<br>
damage will be done anyway by the damnable prion.
<br>
<p>If something like this were shown to be true, death literally would be seen
<br>
as a disease, akin to kuru. Medical means might be found to block the prion
<br>
form and promote benign conformations. What then for the pious? Must we
<br>
assume that God has allowed this vile disorder for our own good, or even
<br>
cast it upon humankind as a punishment? But if that's so, it must apply as
<br>
well to other illnesses, yet even the pious, unless they are very odd, seek
<br>
cures for infections and heart conditions, etc. Why not for death?
