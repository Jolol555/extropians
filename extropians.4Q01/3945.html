<p>
&lt;&lt;Erlich's follow-up sequel to _Population Bomb_, which he titled _Population
<br>
Explosion_ sold even better than the first book, because there were twice as
<br>
many people to buy it. That's not to say that he successfully inspired
<br>
hysteria... obviously most people have ignored his message (if they ever 
<br>
heard
<br>
of it). A sensible response to irrational overpopulation? The solution is 
<br>
left
<br>
as an exercise for the student.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ehrlich's work was considered required reading at my high school, by the 
<br>
science teachers, no less. Because the effects of overpopulation, that 
<br>
Ehrlich scenario-ed, (read predicted) never came about, support for his 
<br>
bombast collapsed. As for overpopulation, I suggest the availability of birth 
<br>
control, coupled (pun?) with an expanding standard of living. The later 
<br>
requires an investment in technical studies, as well as some business acumen. 
<br>
The former requires following instructions.
