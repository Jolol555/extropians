<em>&gt; I think this is a very attractive approach, but there's an issue of whose

</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably find that most of them think identity is preserved by uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and copying. If we look at physical copies then we may find that most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them think identity is not preserved by uploading and software copying but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is preserved by physical copying. If we look at originals then we may find
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; copying.
</em><br>
<p>That's a good point.  By analogy, fish might think the whole &quot;life
<br>
conquers the land&quot; thing was a big waste of time.  On the other hand it
<br>
seems likely that the number of replicators would be greater in the more
<br>
flexible environments like software, and so the remnant of originals
<br>
would not be very significant numerically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another way to think about this is what does fitness means in a posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world? For example someone who is very promiscuous about allowing his mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be copied might end up having many copies of himself, but most of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may become permanently enslaved by others. Do these slaves count toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his reproductive fitness? Or consider a superintelligence that manages to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain mind coherence as it expands in space and stays a single entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (think the Blight). Does it have low fitness because it doesn't reproduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the traditional sense? Or consider a physical copy versus a software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy, or a running copy versus a static stored copy. How do each of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; count towards reproductive fitness? 
</em><br>
<p>You could take a count of the proportion of physical resources devoted to
<br>
each mind's descendants/continuations as a measure of its reproductive
<br>
and survival success.  Ultimately such measures are somewhat arbitrary
<br>
of course but then evolutionary success in biology suffers from the
<br>
same problem in principle.  Those replicators which reproduce more
<br>
efficiently come to be more numerous.  It's kind of tautological.
<br>
Depending on how you measure the outcome, you automatically get a
<br>
definition of reproduction which corresponds to maximizing the numbers
<br>
under that measurement.
