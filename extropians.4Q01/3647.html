<p>I realize you're speculating, but this excites me...  It appears
<br>
to me that we haven't really made any progress on the intelligence
<br>
increase front.  Smart drugs generated lots of interest ~10 years
<br>
ago, but none have really been demonstrated to have a significant
<br>
impact on intelligence AFAIK.  Hard mental exercise is still the
<br>
only real option available.
<br>
<p>So, if you or anyone would care to speculate a bit more, I'm
<br>
interested in 1) how and where new cells would be administered into
<br>
the bean and 2) what kind of an impact such might have on intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is likely to raise some thorny

</em><br>
<p>I don't know that it would initially increase the rich/poor divide.
<br>
Intelligence is no guarantee of financial success.  Side effects
<br>
could further hamper the earning power of early recipients.  If
<br>
the procedure(s) are expensive enough and paid for by recipients,
<br>
initially the divide might narrow.
<br>
<p>But really, concern over intelligence-generated gap between rich
<br>
and poor has got to be combatted.  In a relatively free market, if
<br>
someone gets rich through applying their intellect, they only get
<br>
rich to the extent they provide superior goods that people are
<br>
willing to pay for, increasing the wealth of the entire society in
<br>
the process.
<br>
<p>Would those who profess concern that intelligence increase might
<br>
increase the gap between rich and poor (which I think usually simply
<br>
masks envy and fear of change) advocate reducing the intelligence
<br>
of those above average (surgery? shock therapy? neurotoxins?) in
<br>
order to decrease the gap between rich and poor?  If equality of
<br>
wealth is more important than overall wealth, where does one draw
<br>
the line?
<br>
<p>Sometimes I'm jealous of people much smarter than I (including most
<br>
members of this list...).  Far more than jealously though I feel
<br>
gratitude.  I imagine that if everyone smarter than I were dumbed
<br>
down to my level scientific and technological progress would slow
<br>
down tremendously, even grind to a halt or regress in many areas.
<br>
If everyone above average were to be dumbed down to average, I
<br>
imagine that many processes would break down, there would be mass
<br>
hardship and starvation (in the &quot;first&quot; world too), and even a soft
<br>
singularlity would be many centuries distant, if not downright
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p>Similarly, if I could magically grant everyone already more
<br>
intelligent than I even more intelligence, increasing the gap
<br>
between us, or even just grant everyone more intelligence with the
<br>
exception of myself, I'd do in in a second.  Whatever feelings of
<br>
envy or inadequacy I may feel as I result would be far outweighed
<br>
by the many free lunches I'd get resulting from a society of more
<br>
intelligent individuals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The other aspect that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be interesting is that this will be at the edge of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulatory agencies will be willing to approve and what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most humans would be willing to do to themselves due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to potentially unknown risks.
</em><br>
<p>We can count on regulators to drag their feet every step of the
<br>
way, particularly where technologies are targeted at improvement
<br>
rather than healing.  The interesting thing might not be what
<br>
agencies are willing to explicitly approve, but rather what can be
<br>
gotten away with at the margins of regulatory oversight (due to
<br>
ill-defined regulations and/or availability of jurisdictions that
<br>
don't care as much).  But improvement vs. healing may not be such
<br>
a huge hurdle.  Because there will be risks involved, I suspect
<br>
that most early adopters will be people who do have some kind of
<br>
damage or disease they wish to compensate for/recover from.  The
<br>
technology can be proven legally with risk-takers who ostensibly
<br>
aren't in it for improvement.  Once proven, others can obtain the
<br>
procedures in jurisdictions that don't care about the &quot;ethics&quot; of
<br>
improvement vs. healing so long as you have the cash.
