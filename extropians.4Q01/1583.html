<p>Is government intervention bad because it causes inefficiency by
<br>
distorting the proper market value of real estate, education, wages,
<br>
etc? Or is this inefficiency worth it because it creates areas with
<br>
high concentrations of technological infrastructure and educated
<br>
workers so that technology progresses faster than it would if
<br>
wealth/people/tech were distributed purely according to the dynamics
<br>
of a perfectly competitive market?
<br>
<p>### We exchanged some posts about my belief that the government is actually
<br>
needed to protect the free market from destroying itself, in July of this
<br>
year, I think. I had to stop posting for some time because of a busy
<br>
rotation but I still retain the same conviction (although I could see the
<br>
validity of much of what you and Daniel Ust were saying).
<br>
<p>Not surprisingly, I give the affirmative answer the second question you
<br>
posed. High concentrations of technological infrastructure (be it irrigation
<br>
channels, hand-operated looms or chip fabs) produce a lot of wealth. This
<br>
wealth must be protected from being looted and destroyed by internal end
<br>
external aggressors. The usual organization that springs up to provide such
<br>
protection has the territorial form of a government. Since a good government
<br>
will let the golden goose lay more eggs than a bad government, differences
<br>
between territories grow, further attracting some types of market
<br>
investments to the prosperous areas, in a positive feedback loop. A
<br>
government is a burden but it allows the market to flourish, just like
<br>
sturdy doors and walls keep the fox out of the chicken coop.
