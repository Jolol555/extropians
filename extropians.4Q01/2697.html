<br>
<p>Amir Mosallaie's robot stays where it's told.
<br>
The 9-year-old programmed the brick-sized robot to remain within the confines
<br>
of a black oval ring printed on a large sheet of paper. When its light sensor
<br>
detects black, the contraption, built of Lego brick and a microcomputer, backs
<br>
up, turns around on its four rubber wheels and plays &quot;Fur Elise.&quot;
<br>
<p>Amir's fourth-grade class at Highland Oaks Elementary School in Arcadia is
<br>
testing a novel program using robotics in basic science classes. His teacher,
<br>
Coyla Grumm, said the program teaches more than just scientific concepts; it
<br>
also addresses problem solving and teamwork. &quot;It's that thinking process,&quot; she
<br>
said. &quot;They're choosing what they want to do. They're challenging themselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>Robotics for older children isn't new. But in most school districts, it is an
<br>
elective or a specialized program offered only to middle or high school
<br>
students.
<br>
<p>Arcadia Unified School District's approach is different. The district wants
<br>
students to build and program robots as part of the basic science curriculum
<br>
for elementary and middle school--studying scientific principles by putting
<br>
them to work.
<br>
<p>The robots aren't cheap. Equipping the school for the pilot cost more than
<br>
$29,000. And district officials warn that educators should be wary of useless
<br>
products billed as educational that amount to little more than toys.
<br>
<p>&quot;They're battlebots for kids,&quot; said Robert Leri, the Arcadia district's
<br>
director of technology and information services, referring to the Comedy
<br>
Central show in which people build robots to duke it out in a ring.
<br>
<p>Two years ago the district tested--and rejected--another robotics program
<br>
because officials thought it didn't enhance higher-order thinking skills.
<br>
<p>To avoid such problems, Grumm and Genna Helmberger, a science teacher at Dana
<br>
Middle School in Arcadia, spent a year researching available products. They
<br>
focused on using robotics to apply concepts in the standard science
<br>
curriculum, such as mechanics.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm not teaching robotics; I'm teaching science,&quot; Helmberger said.
<br>
<p>In the classroom, teams of two or three students work with the Mindstorms kit,
<br>
which consists of a block that contains a small computer, two motors, sensors,
<br>
gears, wheels and lots of little pegs and Lego bricks. The district also
<br>
bought a laptop computer for each team to use the software.
<br>
<p>To complete their tasks, the kids build robots following specific
<br>
instructions. They then write programs on laptop computers and download them
<br>
into the robots.
<br>
<p>They can use the sensors, which can detect light or touch, and program the
<br>
robots to react to their environment--playing a note or moving a gear, for
<br>
example.
<br>
<p>One touch of the button and the robots are off--or maybe not.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you make a tiny little mistake, you have to take it apart and do it all
<br>
over,&quot; said Monica Palos, 9, of Monrovia. The process forces the students to
<br>
backtrack and work through the problem themselves.
<br>
<p>As a final project, the children programmed robots to perform a series of
<br>
tasks of their own choice as a Big Showoff. Three girls had improved the
<br>
original design for their robot, using two light sensors to allow the machine
<br>
to follow a black piece of tape on the floor.
<br>
<p>&quot;We added different stuff. We wanted to make a mix-up,&quot; said Palavi Bugga, 9.
<br>
<p>Students found the new approach engaging.
<br>
&quot;Usually I hate science,&quot; Amir said. &quot;We just talk about oceans and stuff.&quot;
<br>
<p>The curriculum also challenges teachers. As soon as the announcement is made
<br>
that robotics time has begun, the 8- and 9-year-olds stream around the
<br>
classroom, grabbing their laptops, robots and boxes full of gears and Lego
<br>
bricks.
<br>
<p>They move tables and desks, revealing mazes they had laid out on the floor
<br>
with black tape. Others build mazes out of bricks for robots with pressure
<br>
sensors to navigate.
<br>
<p>&quot;One thing I have learned from the beginning is that you can't control&quot; the
<br>
children, Grumm said.
<br>
<p>The teachers do need to keep track of the kits' more than 700 pieces, many of
<br>
which measure less than a square inch. Grumm reinforces that fact by having
<br>
students start their lessons by sorting pieces into the many compartments of
<br>
their toolboxes.
<br>
<p>Robotics' &quot;academic aura&quot; and fun applications make it the most popular way to
<br>
get applied science into schools, said Ken Berry, director of the
<br>
International Robot Education Group and professor of educational technology at
<br>
Cal State Northridge.
<br>
<p>Berry works through the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's office of education and
<br>
public outreach. He maintains an e-mail list of about 400 educators in
<br>
Southern California who are interested in robotics.
<br>
<p>Arcadia Schools Supt. Mimi Hennessey was sold on robotics three years ago.
<br>
&quot;These are some of the most important things we can be teaching students, and
<br>
habits of rigorous thinking that need to be learned and practiced throughout
<br>
schooling,&quot; she said.
<br>
<p>But some moments in the unit show that old incentives die hard.
<br>
<p>For their Big Showoff, teammates Palavi, Samantha Miller and Christina Kim,
<br>
all 9, programmed a roverbot to follow a black line on the floor and deliver a
<br>
note and piece of candy to their teacher at her desk.
<br>
<p>Grumm read the note with gusto: &quot;Happy Robot Day! Now do we get an A?&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
