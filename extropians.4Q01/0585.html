<p>Background:
<br>
<p>At the beginning of the 21st century human achievement is a cause for
<br>
celebration - not least in the fields of scientific enquiry and
<br>
technological application. We live longer, healthier lives than ever
<br>
before and have unlocked many of the great mysteries of the natural
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>But have we gone too far? Global warming, species extinction, genetic
<br>
experimentation and the unexpected side effects of agricultural
<br>
technology, to name but a few, are recurrent themes in newspaper
<br>
headlines - and in our nightmares.
<br>
<p>Are scares about modern food and medicines a rational response to a
<br>
world apparently dominated by corporate greed and government corruption,
<br>
or do they express an ill-founded pessimism about human achievement? Do
<br>
the complexities of the natural world demand a more precautionary
<br>
approach, or are we exaggerating uncertainties for fear of the future?
<br>
<p>Have we abandoned the concepts of universal knowledge and objectivity
<br>
for good ? Is there something important about these ideas that needs to
<br>
be rescued? Does the ever-increasing ethical scrutiny of scientists'
<br>
work reflect a more responsible attitude to competing interests or an
<br>
unhelpful politicization of science?
