Another possibility is simply that the Taliban had very little support, even 
<br>
among their own army.  The French journalist held by the Taliban a little bit 
<br>
back said his jailers were mostly opposed to the Taliban but didn't dare to 
<br>
oppose them as they figured it would result in a long walk off a short cliff. 
<br>
&nbsp;Also, once defeat is seen as inevitable, armies typically disintegrate and 
<br>
the population revolts, even if the actual result is far off (e.g. Germany in 
<br>
1918).
<br>
Soldiers don't want to die and civilians don't want to starve when it's not 
<br>
going to make a difference anymore.
<br>
Collapse after the first defeat is very unusual but the Taliban are facing a 
<br>
phenomenally powerful coalition so 
<br>
perhaps the evaluation of &quot;defeat is inevitable&quot; was quite rational.  
<br>
Mazar-e-sharif has a good airport and transportation links to Uzbekistan, so 
<br>
the fall of that city did mean the US could put in whatever it wanted.
