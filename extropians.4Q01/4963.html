<em>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Spike Jones&quot;  I ask permission to commit

<p>OK, Ive made it up now, and Im pre-forgiven.  Today's lesson
<br>
is in comparative religion.
<br>
<p>Let us look at Islam vs Christianity.  The Islamic government of
<br>
Afghanistan was faced with the problem of what to do about the
<br>
great stone Buddha idols, carved into the mountainsides of their
<br>
sacred land.  Hating the idolatrous religion of Buddhism, the
<br>
Taliban decided to destroy the carvings, which led to a cry of
<br>
protest from, well, pretty much the whole world, for these
<br>
historical artifacts were unique.  As you may recall, the Afghan
<br>
government took great offense at this, protesting that the Buddha-
<br>
Preservervation Society cared more about these blasphemous
<br>
idols than about the starving children of Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>How would a more capitalist oriented government have handled
<br>
the situation?  Likely it would have built a fence around the
<br>
idols at a 10 km radius, and allowed investors to build an airstrip
<br>
and concessions, in exchange for a 50% cut of the gate.  They
<br>
could have erected signs on the fence:  &quot;INFIDELS ONLY!&quot;
<br>
or perhaps &quot;ALL CAMEL JOCKEYS KEEP OUT&quot;, etc.
<br>
<p>Consider, the per capita income in Afghanistan before the war
<br>
was, what, about 200 bucks?  25 megapersons, thats about...
<br>
5 billion dollars a year.  5 billion?  HAH!  For Disneyland, that's
<br>
pocket change.  They take in that much money every day
<br>
before lunch.  They could have set up BuddhaLand, charged
<br>
50 bucks a head.  The Chinese tourist trade *alone* coulda
<br>
tripled their per capita.  Honestly, Afghanistan could have
<br>
fed its own starving masses, simply by charging admission to
<br>
the Buddhist statues.  Anarcho-capitalism to the rescue!
<br>
<p>If they really wanted to destroy Buddhism, they could do that
<br>
Disney style too, by marketing it to death, the way Americans
<br>
do.  Disneyland has its Mickey Mouse, the Afghans could have...
<br>
Buddha Bunny.  Then they could run it further into the ground:
<br>
Zen Zebra and the 12 dwarves, (the Dharma Dozen).
<br>
<p>Think of the income, in plastic figurines alone!
<br>
<p>Speaking of comparative religions and figurines, they need
<br>
to do something about the Buddha image.  Just look at
<br>
him, big old flabby beer gut.  Sloppyyyy.  Compare with
<br>
Christianity, check it out next time you see a crucifix.
<br>
Jesus was buff!  Chiseled!  That sucker had abs!
<br>
<p>Oh, the Afghans coulda made a *ton* of money off of
<br>
BhuddaLand, and still kept their PRECIOUS belief system
<br>
intact, but noooooo.
<br>
<p>*Sigh*  spike
