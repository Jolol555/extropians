<p><em>&gt; The USA is dropping bombs on these people for god's sake!
</em><br>
<p>The USA is dropping bombs on a country that has provided a regime
<br>
that has been tolerant to a large terrorist organization for almost
<br>
a decade.
<br>
<p>There are 20+ million people in Afghanistan.  There were a few
<br>
tens of thousands in the Taliban and the military.  If you
<br>
believe that a population cannot control the destiny of a
<br>
country then *PLEASE* explain the situation in Argentina
<br>
over the last several weeks.  The Taliban arose in Afghanistan
<br>
because the population accepted it.
<br>
<p>The USA has made significant efforts to only target members
<br>
of Al Qa'ida and Taliban and I believe in most cases has
<br>
been successful in that effort.  I believe that most people
<br>
would agree that although there have been some errors the
<br>
civilian casualties have been minimal.
<br>
<p>Civilian populations are ultimately responsible for the
<br>
actions of their governments.  In the U.S. that lead
<br>
to civilians in the WTC being targets for terrorists.
<br>
In Afghanistan that results in civilians being brought
<br>
into the &quot;line of fire&quot; in eliminating the Taliban and
<br>
Al Qa'ida.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The USA is at least partly responsible for the rise of the Taliban to power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The USA helped create, train &amp; directly funded, elements in Afghanistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are at least partly responsible for the terrible years of war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &amp; bloodshed that the country has endured.
</em><br>
<p>I do not see an assertion here that the U.S. is responsible for the
<br>
decade of war the Afghani's were subjected to by the Soviet Union.
<br>
The Taliban rose to power in the vacuum that arose only after the
<br>
S.U. was defeated.  Yes, the U.S. helped empower many of the
<br>
people responsible for dragging Afghanistan into an anarchy
<br>
but that was in response to acts of conquest by others.
<br>
I see no claims that life as a Soviet colonial state shoulda/
<br>
woulda/coulda been better than that under Taliban rule.
<br>
<p>(I will not disagree in hindsight that the S.U. may have been
<br>
more extropic than the Taliban -- but one has to argue that
<br>
that the consequences of various actions could have been known
<br>
in advance.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How many Afghanis have died as a direct result of American policies?
</em><br>
<p>How many Afghanis died as a direct result of Soviet policies?
<br>
How many Afghanis died as the result of economic havoc created
<br>
by the Soviets or the Taliban?  How many Afghanis died because
<br>
citizens were simply too weak to stand up against the Soviets
<br>
or the Taliban?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; they helped psychotic religious nuts become our government by giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them guns &amp; missiles,
</em><br>
<p>Facts not in evidence.  While the Intelligence Service of Pakistan
<br>
may have helped promote the Taliban I doubt a case can be made that
<br>
the U.S. gave them &quot;guns &amp; missiles&quot;.
<br>
<p>*What* possible agenda could the U.S. have where it would promote
<br>
the success of fundamentalist Islamic memes ?!?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you really expect twenty odd years of utter bastardry to be just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forgotten, just because NOW you've decided to act with SOME decency? 
</em><br>
<p>No.  But some people may remember that the U.S. *did* help liberate
<br>
Afghanistan from the Soviets.  Others may remember that the U.S. *did*
<br>
help liberate them from the Taliban (as people celbrating in the streets
<br>
seems to demonstrate).
<br>
<p>But people have short memories and they will ultimately be determined
<br>
by who puts food on their table tomorrow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you truly want the US to be safe then the US must act responsibly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It must stop its political &amp; military support of terrorists (sorry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're &quot;freedom fighters&quot; - at least they are until they start bombing YOU)
</em><br>
<p>I believe the estimates of the number of people who may have been
<br>
murdered by Stalin ranges from 7-30 million people.  Unless you can
<br>
make a case that &quot;responsible action&quot; would have been ignoring the
<br>
threat of communist dictatorships then I would say your suggestion
<br>
that the U.S. did not act responsibly is &quot;salt spray&quot; being cast
<br>
by the wind up from an ocean (an interesting odor but little
<br>
substance).
<br>
<p>I'm going to state it quite clearly to Neil, Amara, Samantha
<br>
and others who may be placing a high value on &quot;current&quot; human
<br>
lives (vs. past or future human lives) -- Hitler and Stalin
<br>
*MURDERED* millions of people.  Unless you can make *clear*
<br>
and *reasoned* cases for when one should or should not oppose
<br>
political power structures that give rise to Hitlers &amp; Stalins
<br>
I think your positions are on swampy ground.  How many times
<br>
should one watch Hitlers &amp; Stalins repeat themselves before
<br>
one acts?
<br>
<p>Here is my challenge to you -- define precisely how many people
<br>
should be killed and what evidence of their deaths should be required
<br>
before one should set into motion political (&amp; military) opposition
<br>
against the likes of Hitler, Stalin or bin Laden?
<br>
<p>(For example, I believe Amnesty International has well documented
<br>
hundreds or thousands of cases where people are being killed annually
<br>
by various governments, yet I hear not a *word* of equivalent
<br>
rhetoric against the governments of Russia, China, Burma, Rwanda,
<br>
Indonesia, etc.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; America must become responsible &amp; decent. The empty rhetoric of &quot;liberty &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice for all&quot;, the lie of &quot;the protector of freedom&quot; &amp; the &quot;champion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice&quot; must become true.
</em><br>
<p>The only way to impose &quot;freedom&quot; &amp; &quot;justice&quot; on most nations that
<br>
currently exist in the world would be to conquer them and then redefine
<br>
their political system as the U.S. did with Japan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; America can lead the world, and not just militarily or commercially but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethically as well, if only the government &amp; the people of America have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the strength and courage. 
</em><br>
<p>I would suggest that you have not been reading the discussions of the last
<br>
several months on the extropians list, nor the popular news such as the
<br>
NY Times.  The &quot;ethics&quot; of people with &quot;fundamentalist&quot; perspectives are
<br>
drastically different from those of the America.  Grossly simplified they
<br>
are &quot;If you believe what we believe, then we will tolerate you -- otherwise
<br>
we want to destroy you&quot; in contrast to something along the lines of &quot;We will
<br>
try to understand you and accept you, even if your beliefs are quite different
<br>
from our own&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There can be no justification for the events of 9/11 just as there can be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justification for the many atrocities &amp; crimes of convenience that have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed in America's name.
</em><br>
<p>Claims without facts.  I believe the body count of &quot;innocent&quot; people
<br>
in Afghanistan is still significantly below that of &quot;innocent&quot; people
<br>
in the 911 attacks.  When that ceases to be true I will begin to
<br>
consider whether the U.S. is committing &quot;atrocities &amp; crimes&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The cycle of hatred has to stop somewhere or we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will see the events of 9/11 happening again. And again. And again. 
</em><br>
<p>It isn't a cycle of &quot;hatred&quot; -- it might be a cycle of &quot;fear&quot;.
<br>
America may have a fear of individuals with &quot;absolute&quot; power
<br>
in any nation because the can command forces that represent
<br>
threats to both U.S. government officials as well as significant
<br>
numbers of U.S. citizens.  If one accepts that the primary purpose
<br>
of a U.S. government is to protect its citizens -- not to impose
<br>
its own &quot;framework&quot; on the world -- then its actions have been
<br>
quite &quot;restricted&quot; over the years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; America can be more than just America the great, it could truly become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America the good, America the just, America the free, if only the nation &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's people have the courage &amp; the humility to change for the better, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give as well as receive, to heal instead of harm, to become a true leader of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity. 
</em><br>
<p>Noble.  And I agree in principle.  But this is the &quot;carrot&quot; argument
<br>
and I question whether it works with some individuals (or countries)
<br>
without the &quot;stick&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; can America the same selfless courage as a nation?
</em><br>
<p>It has demonstrated such in the past and I do not doubt that
<br>
the resolve is present to do so again.  A significant question
<br>
is whether or not we have leaders capable of doing so.
<br>
