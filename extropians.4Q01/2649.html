<br>
<p>Hmm. Northern Alliance is having a rather productive week
<br>
today. Averaging *more* than one bastion of Taliban resistance per
<br>
day? After being beaten back to like 5% of the country? Some
<br>
interpretations:
<br>
<p>1. (most likely) NA didn't control just 5% of the country to begin
<br>
with. The maps and numbers quote by the media reflected the confirmed
<br>
NA locations, not the scattered enclaves throughout the
<br>
countryside. The reason their advance seems so lightning quick is that
<br>
once a few crucial battles are won and a few critical defections take
<br>
place, there is a cascading effect of all the little pockets of
<br>
resistance condensing into one big area of NA control. Furthermore, it
<br>
isn't clear from the maps how much of that land is habitable or even
<br>
traversible. Perhaps a more accurate picture of how much of the
<br>
country is controlled by whom would emerge if such land was excluded
<br>
from the calculations.
<br>
<p>2. (also likely) Hey, those daisy-cutters and tomahawks really do work
<br>
if you take the time to do it right. This has interesting implications
<br>
for the future of warfare-- that perhaps ground troops are now just
<br>
playing an auxiliary role (mop-up, spotting, psychological presence)
<br>
to that of the airforce rather than the other way around.
<br>
<p>3. (maybe less likely, but disturbing enough to merit some thought)
<br>
It's too easy. The Taliban is not really retreating, just blending
<br>
into the countryside, perhaps along with Mullah Omar and Pig
<br>
Rottin. Perhaps with collusion from NA, and perhaps not. The thing
<br>
that appears to be the war front keeps advancing until it swallows up
<br>
the whole country, but the individuals we're seeking are nowhere to be
<br>
found. Meanwhile the Taliban starts doing the sort of hit-and-run
<br>
attacks they specialize in all over the supposedly conquered territory
<br>
(possibly targetting US military and humanitarian installations).
<br>
<p>4. (unlikely but really disturbing) There is collusion going on, but
<br>
of a more sinister nature. We're letting the Taliban play breir
<br>
rabbit, because we know it will be bloody, expensive, and ultimately
<br>
useless to defeat them for real. We will set up a coalition
<br>
government, rescue our national prestige, and increase Bush's chances
<br>
of reelection. Then a few years later, the coalition government is
<br>
overthrown or subverted by former Taliban members or some equally
<br>
unsavory group, but by then, we will have forgotten all about them and
<br>
will have no mandate to get involved. Pig Rottin and his cronies
<br>
continue blowing shit up, provoking fear and outrage that will
<br>
continue giving Big Brother carte blanche to
<br>
regulate/sieze/search/ban/censor anything he wants, at home or
<br>
abroad. The revolution ushered in by cryptography and the internet is
<br>
narrowly averted.
