Forwarded from a friend. I think he's on to something, sort of, but
<br>
the margins are too narrow this morning for me to comment. Maybe later.

<p>Letter to the Editor
<br>
&quot;Is that IT?&quot;
<br>
Dec 6th 2001
<br>
<p>Dear Sirs &amp; Madams,
<br>
<p>Regarding your story &quot;Is that IT?&quot; while I share the Economist's view 
<br>
that the Segway Human Transporter might merely be a glorified motor 
<br>
scooter, and Kamen is a bit immodest in its potential, I believe that 
<br>
there are aspects to the machine that were overlooked in the article.
<br>
<p>The Segway is exciting not because it is a locomotion device for a 
<br>
human. It is exciting because it comes to the high technology 
<br>
industry at a time when innovation has achieved something of a flat 
<br>
line, if not a decline in some circles. The Segway is important 
<br>
because it is a portent to the future of the man-to-machine 
<br>
interface, based on movement and bodily influences.
<br>
<p>The real innovation of the Segway is that, even if illusory, the 
<br>
device adopts the rider's sense of balance, and transparently 
<br>
translates it to mechanized locomotion. The Segway has an operating 
<br>
system that is dedicated to the task of physically extending a 
<br>
person's ability to stand and walk. It is an operating system that is 
<br>
married not only to the rider's subtle movements and sense of 
<br>
balance, but responsive to an array of gyroscopes, interpreting and 
<br>
responding to motion and balance data in real time.
<br>
<p>The idea of creating a new operating system with the powerful and 
<br>
ever cheaper processors of our day devoted to extending the human 
<br>
physical experience is very exciting. Computing innovation should not 
<br>
merely be relegated to the desktop, or these days, the palm-top. The 
<br>
heart of computing innovation lies in its promise to extend the human 
<br>
experience of the world by presenting opportunity in the most 
<br>
transparent, unobtrusive way possible, the true mark of effective 
<br>
human interfacing technology.
<br>
<p>Trying to imagine how Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop or a 
<br>
palm-held organizer with a cell phone will further develop in the 
<br>
next 5 to 10 years does not elicit imagining the great arc of 
<br>
innovation to come. Yes, these tools will incrementally improve and 
<br>
move forward; however, the ground breaking changes ahead in the area 
<br>
of computing will most certainly lie in technologies far beyond the 
<br>
desktop and palm-top, extending the human experience to the outside 
<br>
world. Segway is a shining example of how the innovations to come 
<br>
will come from unexpected quarters.
<br>
<p>Although it is just a scooter, the technological arc of innovation 
<br>
that is driving the Segway has a long incline ahead. People who use 
<br>
the Segway love it. Yes, just a scooter, but one that somehow &quot;knows&quot; 
<br>
you. Computing magic to be sure. The Macintosh generated similar user 
<br>
enthusiasm, and debuted at a similar price point. Today, you can 
<br>
stuff a box with 10 high speed processors and a handful of 
<br>
gyroscopes, working in consort with a custom O.S. to deliver a 
<br>
real-time response to a user's unspoken, un-typed, un-moused physical 
<br>
gestures---creating mechanical locomotion that &quot;feels&quot; natural. How 
<br>
this technology with play out and spread into other applications 
<br>
seems at least as boundless as the Mac in 1984.

Dec 6th 2001
<br>
<p>An invention that will &quot;revolutionise&quot; transport has been unveiled
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=895428">http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=895428</a>
<br>
<p><p>IN SOME quarters, it was hailed as a revolutionary advance in 
<br>
personal transport, with the potential even to replace the car. The 
<br>
electrically driven, single-rider device from a noted inventor would 
<br>
cut pollution and herald the dawn of a new era of transport. The date 
<br>
was 1985: the product, an electric &quot;tricycle&quot;, the Sinclair C5.
<br>
<p>This week an electric, two-wheeled &quot;scooter&quot; called the Segway Human 
<br>
Transporter was unveiled with similar fanfare. It weighs 36kg, 
<br>
travels at a maximum speed of 20km an hour, and has a range of 27km 
<br>
on a single charge of its battery.
<br>
<p>For all the fuss made so far about this device-also known as Ginger 
<br>
or &quot;IT&quot;-its main innovation is a prosaic one: its ability to stay 
<br>
upright. It does this by using a set of five sensors that measure its 
<br>
motion in all three dimensions, and also its angle of tilt to the 
<br>
horizontal. These sensors report their results to a computer that 
<br>
controls the wheels 100 times a second, and the wheels then move so 
<br>
as to keep the platform level.
<br>
<p>Thus, when Segway tilts forward, the wheels turn faster to stop it 
<br>
toppling over. If the forward movement is too rapid, they slow down, 
<br>
or even go into reverse. This means that Segway can move over rough 
<br>
terrain, travel up low kerbs and even follow its rider up a staircase 
<br>
like a faithful hound. Riders will, though, fall off if they hit a 
<br>
high enough kerb. And Segway has no brakes.
<br>
<p>Dean Kamen, Segway's inventor, is not exactly modest about his 
<br>
device. He claims it is &quot;the first real improvement on walking since 
<br>
the invention of the sandal&quot;. Where the wheel, the bicycle, the car 
<br>
and the roller-skate fit into Dr Kamen's world view is unclear.
<br>
<p>Segway may prove popular for getting around airports, warehouses and 
<br>
museums, or for stealing bags and snatching wallets. But whether it 
<br>
will become the mass-market device that its inventor hopes remains to 
<br>
be seen. It is open to the elements, the rider has to stand and 
<br>
(horror) there is nowhere to put the stereo and sub-woofer systems. 
<br>
The retail version should be available late next year and is likely 
<br>
to cost $3,000. Or you could buy a second-hand C5.
