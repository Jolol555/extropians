Seems reasonable, depending on one's perspective. It's like choosing a means 
<br>
to earn a living, one tends to pursue that which is most bearable, rather 
<br>
then least tolerable. I knew a Swedish women who lived in the US and so 
<br>
leftist, she couldn't abide Reagan's America, so she went home to Sweden with 
<br>
her Anerican born husband and children. I liked her as a person, but thought 
<br>
(and still think) that her worldview was whacked.
<br>
<p>I still don't disagree with your decision, simply because Europe seems to be 
<br>
a great place for academics and research-right up your alley.  I remember 
<br>
reading about a brilliant, British mathematician, in one of the early issues 
<br>
of Discover magazine, who was doing valuable work in massively, multiple, 
<br>
mathematical dimensions. The fellow had spent several years at MIT, and was 
<br>
so ruffled by the &quot;American militarist mind-set&quot; that he relocated to New 
<br>
Zealand, &quot;a nuclear-free zone.&quot; I bet it was the right move for him anyway. 
<br>
He could also 'roll' his tongue into a clover-leaf pattern, which is 
<br>
apparently, quite rare. Europe is good.
