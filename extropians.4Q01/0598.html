<em>&gt; Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've got a technical question, so I hope there are some technically minded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people out there (erm...). Warning to non-IT types... you will likely find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this entire post entirely pointless, so switch off now!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm doing YADA work at the moment (Yet Another Database App), and I've run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into an old problem for which there never seems to be a really good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution. This particular app is targetted at RDBMS Brand X (actually it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sybase), and now there is a need to retarget it to another RDBMS. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive that more databases will creep into the story over time, so this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the old database-independent-app problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I hear you!
<br>
<p>This is actually close to my speciality.  I've been doing
<br>
persistence middleware and object persistence especially for a
<br>
lot of the last 15 years.  My speciality is object persistence
<br>
and especially through middleware I created.  I just finished
<br>
the grand opus of this work (unfortunately proprietary to my
<br>
employer for now) in Java.  The performance is quite good.  The
<br>
system includes in memory caching, multiple threading, its own
<br>
lock manager and an adapter framework for plugging in different
<br>
database products.  It doesn't matter if they are even of the
<br>
same type (all relational for instance).  At the top the
<br>
applications only see the middleware API.  Also included is
<br>
builtin support for binary relations, persistent collections and
<br>
persistent queues.  There is room in the architecture to scale
<br>
and distribute the lock manager and cache and to support
<br>
language adapters for different software language object and
<br>
structure persistence.   The system supports dynamically
<br>
difining new object/structs whose instances can then be
<br>
persisted, queried, related to other instances and so on.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; The big drama with retargetting the app is the mighty mountain of SQL which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is database specific. RDBMSs are supposed to follow standards with their SQL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - yeah, right. While they do look superficially similar, SQL dialects differ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fundamental join syntax, in built in functions, in the kinds of primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data types they provide operators for, etc. This can be a really big hassle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and from an ongoing maintenance point of view it is big enough to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project killer, especially if it forces a codebase to be forked into one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy for each database to be targetted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What is needed to make a middleware approach work is to
<br>
concentrate on the type of persistence services that are needed
<br>
for your domain of applications instead of diving down
<br>
immediately into SQL blues.  Build a good layer for giving that
<br>
which sits on top of adapters which abstract out the vagaries
<br>
that are driving you nuts.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In the past I've worked on systems using various approaches to solving this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, from parallel code bases for each database (yes, really!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; urrgghh....), through database tables full of alternate forms of queries for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each desired database (still nasty to maintain), even apps which try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stick to a common simple subset of SQL which works across all dbs (a noble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but doomed approach). The nicest approach I've used so far was a system I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built for translating the SQL from one database's dialect to another at run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, so that I could stick to one brand of SQL with impunity (within some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictions).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Embedding SQL of any flavor within the application code already
<br>
produces cognitive dissonance, known in the industry as
<br>
&quot;impedance mismatch&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm really truly sick of this stupid problem popping up all the time, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it's time to nail it. I've got some ideas for the Grand Solution to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proprietary database evilness, and I'm ready to go and build these solutions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself. However, before I go off half cocked, I was hoping others could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share their experiences with this common problem, solutions they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used/know of. I don't want to reinvent the wheel, but the best that google
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been able to tell me is that yes, this really is a problem without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decent solution, and for which one may buy all manner of half baked partial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixes. If people can help me get a decent feel for what is available to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address this problem, I can move forward in some sensible manner.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps the above could give you some ideas.  If your world is
<br>
guaranteed to be always relational then it can make sense to
<br>
base middleware first on an ODBC adapter.   This gives you the
<br>
most coverage the most cheaply.
