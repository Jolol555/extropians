<em>&gt; This is the central element that keeps most of us intrigued with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.  Why can the other side not see such obvious and basic concepts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why can't each side explain what they mean in simple terms that are accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the opposing side?  Why are there so many intelligent people on both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sides of the issue, when the issue seems so obvious to everybody?
</em><br>
<p>I think many people engange in the mental masturbation exercise of
<br>
asking what &quot;I&quot; means to avoid the difficult, but meaningful, questions:
<br>
<p>What is it that you want?  What is it that you fear?
<br>
<p>All of the thought experiments suggested in these arguments are
<br>
interesting setups, but again they just ask the wrong question at
<br>
the end.  The question is not, given some bizzare scenario, which
<br>
of the physical things or processes involved is &quot;me&quot;.  That's
<br>
just a matter of which definition you pick.  The question to ask
<br>
is &quot;out of all the likely, measurable, visible results of the
<br>
situation, which do we consider desirable, and which do we consider
<br>
undesirable?  And how can we achieve more of the former and less of
<br>
the latter?
<br>
<p>I don't think there's anyone here who will rationally argue
<br>
with the contention that if I underwent a non-destructive
<br>
atom-by-atom copy process, two 100-kg lumps of matter would wake
<br>
up with the memeories I presently call &quot;mine&quot;, as well as the
<br>
sensations, perceptions, values, desires, and intentions I call
<br>
mine.  It doesn't matter to me which one I call &quot;me&quot;, what
<br>
matters is what actual consequences will this action have on
<br>
the world, are they likely to happen in the future, and which
<br>
of them are good and bad?
<br>
<p>What it is that we want?  What is it that we fear?
<br>
