My comments to an offlist msg.
<br>
<p>Stunningly obvious, but I guess the word hasn't gotten out. Or they
<br>
had some column inches to fill...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; FBI, CIA Warn Congress of More Attacks;
</em><br>

<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8418-2001Oct4.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8418-2001Oct4.html</a>
<br>
)
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The investigative case has to take a back seat to preventing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next terrorist act,&quot; a senior law enforcement official said. &quot;That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes right from the top, from the president of the United States on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;[P]reventing the _next_...&quot; I rollick with mirth at their merry jape.
<br>
By definition, this is of course impossible. Oh tempura, oh morays--
<br>
which can be loosely translated as &quot;dangle enough food, you'll get bad bites&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In preparation, the FBI has a plan in place to go &quot;full tilt&quot; for 72
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours whenever the president decides to make a move against bin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laden, al Qaeda or Afghanistan's ruling Taliban government, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; official said. At the investigation's command center in FBI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; headquarters, a team of analysts and agents has been working around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the clock sifting through reports of potential threats since Sept. 11.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. officials acknowledge it is difficult to understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation behind some of the threats they have learned about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In response to threats from bin Laden's network that were detected in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; June and July, for example, officials made decisions to abandon some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. embassies and to move Navy ships in foreign ports out to sea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, officials have concluded, the threats may have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disinformation designed to occupy officials' attention, or to allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bin Laden operatives to observe American counterterror lockdown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methods, a knowledgeable source said.
</em><br>
<p>Welcome to war. Idjits. *Sigh*. We need a buttload of small units with
<br>
their own tactics. In a word, no huge Federal spasm of response, rather
<br>
our old buddy the unorganized militia. This will take years to ramp up,
<br>
but &quot;how old will you be in 4 years if you _don't_...?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Shelby said law enforcement agencies believe terrorists will do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something unexpected, and thus the agencies are trying to think &quot;out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the box&quot; in anticipating what might be ahead. However, he noted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bin Laden has been known to return to the same targets repeatedly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the World Trade Center, which terrorists with possible ties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to bin Laden's group bombed in 1993.
</em><br>
<p>No shit, Sherlock.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A senior government official said yesterday that if al Qaeda follows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its normal pattern, &quot;other attacks are in various stages of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planning.&quot; The U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombed in 1998, were first surveilled as targets in 1994, according
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to court testimony earlier this year.
</em><br>
<p>No *fscking* shit, Sherlock.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said bin Laden's terrorist organization &quot;likes to mix tactics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targets.&quot; Under that theory, more airplane hijackings seem less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely, because security has been increased. Ground-based operations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he said, seem more probable.
</em><br>
<p>Pish and tush. Squeeze a balloon, a bulge appears above and below.
<br>
Water is wet, the USA is the most target-rich environment for partisans
<br>
in the world. This is news?
