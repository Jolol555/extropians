</em><br>
<p>Quite a bit of brainpower is being channeled into just that. A short
<br>
answer to the questions you're raising is &quot;Make each individual
<br>
payment so cheap and so easy, it will actually take less effort to
<br>
compensate you than to circumvent you&quot;. The devil is in the details,
<br>
of course. Perhaps there are individuals more closely involved in
<br>
working out those details on this list who would be better qualified
<br>
to fill you in on them.
<br>
<p>As a practical matter, I'd advise caution for writers. The system is
<br>
crumbling, but the book market will take longer than software and
<br>
music (for booklovers it seems that the medium really is part of the
<br>
message). Not that you shouldn't try it, just take it slow and
<br>
easy. When you find a business model that works, you'll cash in on
<br>
being one of the few left standing as well as on all the hype
<br>
surrounding open-this and free-that these days. But, study the
<br>
experiences of other writers and artists to find out what has and
<br>
hasn't worked. Look into what is actually available in the way of
<br>
micropayments. Read what Eric Raymond has to say, and heck, write to
<br>
him and ask (<a href="mailto:esr@thyrsus.com?Subject=Re:%20Creating%20Wealth%20--%20a%20modest%20correction&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.GSO.4.32.0110262237160.2925-100000@jane.itd.umich.edu&gt;">esr@thyrsus.com</a>). We've been so busy blasting away at the
<br>
desperate powergrab issuing from the recording and sofware industries,
<br>
we haven't been devoting enough time to the constructive side of the
<br>
question: &quot;So, what business models WILL work in a world of nonrival,
<br>
nonexcludable information?&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. Crocker, other fellow info-libertarians, ideas?
<br>

<br>
* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
<br>
* honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
<br>
* and its Jihad.&quot;                                                   *
