<em>&gt; &gt; Olga, where is the racist jibe? I don't see one. ... He didn't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*complain*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about the situation. He simply gave his view of why he lost his job,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plausibly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I took the very fact that Mike posted what he did into consideration.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the past he has referred to various cultures in South America and Mexico as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kleptocracies, and if I remember correctly - was one of the people who saw
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing racist in that lovely article that someone posted by Fred Reed.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(please oh please oh please) we don't need to rehash the Reed screed.
</em><br>
<p>I read &quot;kleptocracies&quot; to refer to the governments, rather than the people. 
<br>
Maybe I misunderstood.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It may in fact be Mike's opinion that he is being displaced by &quot;Indian job
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shops.&quot;  I'm not exactly sure what that is, and I am assuming he didn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Indians&quot; from a  particular Indus Valley civilization, but our own native
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind, yes?
</em><br>
<p>For whatever it's worth, there is a booming software development business 
<br>
in India. I have had a number of Indian (yes, Asian) firms solicit business 
<br>
from me in the past two years. They are in direct competition with small 
<br>
operators like myself and Mike.
<br>
<p>Most of the work I do requires &quot;hands on&quot; the hardware, so it is harder to 
<br>
outsource than Windows or Linux applications, which only require a PC to 
<br>
develop.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I would welcome seeing &quot;Native American&quot; based firms in this 
<br>
market. So far, the only visible &quot;Indian&quot; businesses here have been casinos 
<br>
and oil / coal businesses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In my own locality of King County, Washington, voters defeated an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Affirmative Action bill not too long ago.  Do I think that was racist?  Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While some people think Affirmative Action itself is &quot;racist&quot; (even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the group of people who've benefited the most from Affirmative Action in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;past, I believe, have been &quot;white&quot; women) I think it balances things out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better (and much faster) than if humans were left to root out for the milk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of human kindness on their own.
</em><br>
<p>Affirmative action as practiced is code for putting less qualified persons 
<br>
into slots just because of their sex / age / religion / national origin / etc.
<br>
<p>Anytime government gets into the act of &quot;balancing&quot; or &quot;correcting&quot; social 
<br>
ills, it causes much more harm than good. As far as educating people that 
<br>
racism is bad, I think in many case it has the direct opposite effect - 
<br>
those who are already racist now simply need to point out a qualified white 
<br>
who did not get hired while a less qualified minority did, to convert 
<br>
others to their point of view.
<br>
<p>Around Chicago, it is common for white controlled companies to spin off a 
<br>
&quot;woman&quot; or &quot;minority owned&quot; firm so they can bid for city work and have a 
<br>
better chance at getting the job.  Because of the law, they get two bids in 
<br>
instead of one, and now the city can accept the &quot;minority&quot; bid at a higher 
<br>
price than the &quot;old boy&quot; bid, and so enrich the &quot;old boy&quot; while appearing PC.
<br>
<p>Anecdotal evidence: I went to an all-male high school in Chicago - one had 
<br>
to pass a test to get in. There were about 10% black students - and ALL of 
<br>
them passed the tests - this was about the percentage of blacks in the area 
<br>
served by Lane Tech, so they were &quot;equally&quot; represented. They were among 
<br>
the highest scoring members of the student body, too. There was very little 
<br>
white - black tension or racism.
<br>
<p>There was a dearth of Latino, particularly Puerto Rican students - so the 
<br>
Board of Education let a &quot;balance&quot; number of unqualified students in. They 
<br>
tended to be disruptive, and some of them were the ONLY students in the 
<br>
school who had to repeat years. There was a fair amount of racist remarks 
<br>
made by both black and white students against these kids. Affirmative 
<br>
action reinforced the present anti-Puerto Rican sentiments, and instilled 
<br>
them in some places they had never existed.
<br>
<p>Later, PC concerns led the Board to allow female students  - actually, it 
<br>
was two years after I graduated - but their approach was not to just allow 
<br>
qualified students in - they had to remove some shop classes to make way 
<br>
for &quot;home economics&quot; and &quot;sewing&quot; labs (no joke!) in a technical / college 
<br>
preparatory high school. The air conditioning and aviation shops were shut 
<br>
down to make way for these &quot;girl&quot; subjects. The anti-female sentiments were 
<br>
increased by the apparent destruction of the whole reason for the school's 
<br>
existence by the changes.
<br>
<p>Recently, I read in the alumni newsletter that many of the original girls 
<br>
who went to Lane Tech did so specifically to get those shop and technical 
<br>
classes. In this case, affirmative action / PC hurt the population it was 
<br>
supposed to be helping.
<br>
<p>My oldest daughter was actively discouraged from taking &quot;shop&quot; classes in 
<br>
our high school - as they were for &quot;jocks&quot;. When she finally took a small 
<br>
engines course, she discovered she already knew more than the course would 
<br>
teach simply from hanging around with me, working on our cars.
<br>
<p>If affirmative action results in persons or firms getting jobs they are 
<br>
unqualified to do, then all of society suffers.
