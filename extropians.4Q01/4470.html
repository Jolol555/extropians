<p>Simply open your eyes to what we have done in the Middle East
<br>
and what we continue to do to this day.  It doesn't require
<br>
&quot;legitimate governments&quot;.  It requires the willingness to look
<br>
and consider.   It isn't about the Taliban, or any other
<br>
government.  It is about us.  Are we afraid to look and know?
