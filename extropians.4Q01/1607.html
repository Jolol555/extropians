<p>Actually, a surprising amount of that work is already not directly

paid for by the end user. Rafal, when you publish your papers in
<br>
certain journals, *you* pay a small fee for the priviledge of doing
<br>
so, don't you? If you could choose to make your paper available for
<br>
free online to anybody who wants it, wouldn't you choose to do so on
<br>
the premise that it would increase the number of times you are cited
<br>
by colleagues?
<br>
<p>When you need help with a wierd program error, what is the first
<br>
thing you do-- buy a manual or perform a google search for a unique
<br>
phrase extracted from the error message?
<br>
<p>Technical materials often don't sell enough copies to make a big
<br>
profit, yet they are obviously valuable. Sure enough, the market has

found and is continuing to refine models to encourage their
<br>
development and distribution. Put a little trust into unbridled

capitalism, people.
