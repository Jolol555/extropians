I thought I'd fire up the symbiotic intelligence with a discussion
<br>
about what to do with the situation in Afghanistan after the war.
<br>
<p>Lets assume for sake of argument that Ossama is no more, and the
<br>
Taliban have been routed (not completely destroyed).
<br>
<p>I'll start with my own scenario:
<br>
<p>I'd like to see the major cities secured by U.N. peacekeeping
<br>
troops at the earliest possible moment. This not only frees up
<br>
combat troops, but gives all those opposed to us being there in the
<br>
first place something useful to do. Start bringing in relief
<br>
supplies.
<br>
<p>Then they will of course need a government. Given that they face
<br>
many of the problems we did, I would like to suggest a form of
<br>
democracy, with an effective separation of church and state.
<br>
Adoption of the U.N. protocol on human rights would be a good
<br>
thing, especially universal suffrage. Two houses with 2
<br>
representatives in the senate from each tribe to balance things
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>We should then contribute a fair (generous) share to helping out.
<br>
I think anything other than basic humanitarian aid should be
<br>
directly tied to seeing the above items adopted. You don't want a
<br>
democracy? Fine, but lots fewer dollars in aid. Woman don't get to
<br>
vote? Fine, but even less dollars.
<br>
<p>I'd like us to immediately rebuild our embassy and something else
<br>
I always thought we should do. I'd like to see us build a large
<br>
well equipped clinic/50 bed hospital. This would be an off shoot of
<br>
the embassy, In fact build the embassy on top of the hospital.
<br>
<p>This is something I think we should do in numerous parts of the
<br>
world where needed. U.S. aid could be in direct form as supplies
<br>
and personnel for these clinics. Treatment would be free to those
<br>
in need, and could focus on things like immunization. They could be
<br>
privatized later.
<br>
<p>Ok, there's a start.
