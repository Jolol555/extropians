</em><br>
<p><p>Cars manufactured in Asia are very cheap.  The US has a relatively stiff
<br>
tariff structure for cars that are manufactured in Asia.  Some &quot;Asian&quot; cars
<br>
are actually designed, engineered, and manufactured in the US.  Of course, a
<br>
fair number of &quot;European&quot; cars are built exactly the same way and shipped
<br>
into Europe.  There are two different things going on here.  For the Asian
<br>
market, the US uses tariffs to keep them from dumping extremely cheap cars
<br>
in the US, and to get around this they build some of their cars here rather
<br>
than importing them.  In the case of the number of European cars
<br>
manufactured here, it is because the build quality of American production
<br>
lines is higher and cheaper than European production lines so for some cars
<br>
it makes economic sense to manufacture them here.  If Europe does not impose
<br>
heavy tariffs on Japanese cars, then they may offer a good value in Europe.
<br>
<p>The &quot;quality&quot; of various countries varies quite a bit depending on the class
<br>
of vehicle.  For the full-size trucks that are extremely popular in many of
<br>
the more rural areas, nothing can touch the durability and reliability of
<br>
American manufacturers (the US also makes excellent large motors).  For
<br>
economical city driving, the Japanese have a pretty good grasp of the
<br>
market.  For mid- to upper-range sedans, it boils down to personal taste
<br>
because nobody is really producing crap in that market.  While you wouldn't
<br>
know it from driving in urban California, at its peak the Japanese
<br>
penetration in the US car market was around 14% back in the 1980s.  In many
<br>
areas that offer a nastier environment than the fair weather environs of
<br>
California, Japanese cars have a reputation for having poor durability and
<br>
don't sell well (while I've owned many Japanese vehicles, this has generally
<br>
been true in my experience as well).  European cars tend to be relatively
<br>
expensive in the US compared to either Japanese or American cars, but the
<br>
quality tends to be good.  I would say that dollar for dollar, European cars
<br>
have about the same build quality as their current American counterparts.
<br>
However, this isn't too surprising when you consider that a number of the
<br>
popular European lines sold in the US come off of American manufacturing
<br>
lines.
<br>
<p>It is interesting to note that a substantial portion of Asian cars are
<br>
actually designed and engineered by American design teams, whereas the
<br>
Europeans do their own engineering.  This applies to many other industries
<br>
as well; it seems that one of the biggest exports the US has to countries
<br>
like Japan is engineers.
