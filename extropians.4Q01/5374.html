<em>&gt; Instead use state-of-the-art ethical and political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminology in the constitution, and be aware that it might need future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; updating (and that this updating may be troublesome).
</em><br>
<p>Well, that does mean that we should continue to use the an old system. I did not mean that we should search for a perfect system,
<br>
but a better one.
<br>
<p>Even though I do not promise anything, I think I have discovered some hints on how a better system would work and I intend to
<br>
discover and elaborate more of it. It would, however, seem rather futile to try to explain how this unconsolidated tangle would have
<br>
superiority over the old system currently.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; Are you saying all these approaches are futile, or are you doubtful about certain commonly used rights concepts? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I find the idea of using &quot;inherent&quot; and &quot;God-given&quot; rights to base our decisions on what *any* society must provide for its people
<br>
the most questionable. How can we speak for God or even for our unspoken &quot;nature&quot; when we claim certain such rights? How can we
<br>
decide that all humans wish to seek happiness, or that all humans would work most efficiently if they merely concentrate on
<br>
self-serving behaviour?
<br>
<p><p>I also find the concepts of rights itself problematic in practical use:
<br>
<p>1) rights often conflict with each other in common usage. When a smoker claims he or she has the right to smoke, the other can claim
<br>
that he or she has the right to breathe fresh air. You could claim that the legal system can solve the problem, but it seems like
<br>
legal systems in democratic societies suffer from red tape and lobbying influence.
<br>
<p>This system can lead to significent complexity in a system that could cause globally inefficient behaviour. If you have a read a few
<br>
encylopedias' worth of text to know you never commit any crime and when the law says that it will not excuse any ignorance of
<br>
itself, then you know some problems do exist.
<br>
<p>2) rights imply that there exists a governming body distinct from the &quot;common people&quot;, from whom the rights can originate. This
<br>
would have little relevance in a society without such a &quot;seperated&quot; government.
<br>
<p>3) rights demand that others respect them. How do you police such compliance? Why don't we design a system that would prevent the
<br>
problem from occuring in the first place?
<br>
<p>4) rights had remained with us for quite some time already. The current implementations cannot solve our problems, as different
<br>
fractions continue to claim conflicting rights against each other. We should definitely find alternatives that can work, or work
<br>
better.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; With a rights system you can add a generalization layer to the rules: people have the right to leave, with a rule telling certain
<br>
conditions on this like having to settle debts but also with a clause telling that this rule only applies for reasonable
<br>
situations - i.e. the &quot;administrative fee&quot; could be judged against the right. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This has little difference other than explictly expressing a part of the system. Would it have any difference if we say something
<br>
like: &quot;You can leave if you have performed the following operations: 1) ensure no outstanding debts, 2) ... 3) ...&quot;
<br>
<p>If you would like to have some more details, you can provide hyperlinks to a page with detailed explainations of the problem and
<br>
possible known solutions so that people will know the rationale for the rules. The rules can exist independently while others can
<br>
keep challenging the reasons (which we explictly express rather than implictly imply) and finding better ways to implement them (as
<br>
in Intellicracy, the &quot;open-source&quot; political system for societies). They can change the rules abritarily whenever they discover a
<br>
better implementation.
<br>
<p>Rights do not tell us the actual rationale behind the rules but just provide a more &quot;general&quot; layer. It does not allow easy
<br>
challenging due to its ambiguity. To see an example, try telling me what &quot;the right to liberty&quot; means, then ask a few other people
<br>
what they think it means. Even a rigorously elaborated example still remains constrained by Godel's Theorem so loopholes or
<br>
inconsistencies can exist.
<br>
<p><p>Concerning the problems of debt problems, I agree that a lot of problems do lie with the details. The current approach I know would
<br>
require complete trust with the society's members (but on an as needed basis) to avoid allowing such freedom. This could cause
<br>
problems with other societies who do not operate on such an &quot;open&quot; system, discouraging them from joing the Federation.
<br>
<p>I hope that someone will eventually find a far better solution to solve this problem. Since we don't have to build such a Federation
<br>
today, we still have quite some time. The solution would definitely require us to transcending the current limitations of know legal
<br>
systems (i.e. using a different, more &quot;global&quot; approach).
<br>
<p>I could not express this easily but instead would offer provide an analogy of &quot;thinking out of the box&quot;. For instance, the problems
<br>
of Quantum Physics can dissolve quite well when we use the perspective of Digital Physics to illuminate them instead.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So? The fact that a lot of people doesn't get it doesn't mean it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a practical idea. The Internet developed wonderfully long before it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known to many people, and in fact it was likely this long try-out period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that made it so resilient and robust once a lot of people began to flock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to it.
</em><br>
<p>Please do recall that the Internet started with the blessing and support of the US military (which seems to have limitless
<br>
resources) and the US Government. Then, it had also received the support of the scientific community before the public started using
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>I wish to point out that it does not have an &quot;enemy&quot; determined to prevent or sabotage its formation. In the case of the Federation
<br>
things may not seem so straight forward.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; If 99% of humanity views the federation(s) with apathy or scorn, so what? That gives plenty of time to iron out the bugs and see
<br>
if the system really is worth anything. It also gives time to people to come up with new ways of seeing things and ways of
<br>
presenting the new ideas to others. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>If this happens, then the Federation would not have sufficient influence to help solve the problems of our world. I suppose most of
<br>
us here had heard of the powers of network, in that the whole has more value than the sum of its parts. With each additional member,
<br>
the Federation gains more than just a linear increase in power (and thus seeming much more attractive to others).
<br>
<p>Of course, I didnt originally intend this to solve current world problems, so it might have less relevance in this respect.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But frankly, the federation idea is hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolutionary and would be a trivial blip on the world political scene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to current and near future issues like terrorism, the rise of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; China and India, the federative changes in Europe, globalization and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else.
</em><br>
<p>While the Federation idea seems non-revolutionary to us, it may seem revolutionary to some who have the power to stop us. In game
<br>
theory, we had learnt that any change in the power structure of a society will only either preserve a leading party's current
<br>
hierarchy or worsen it. When things cannot get better, then it can only get worse.
<br>
<p>It would seem (locally) reasonable if some of these rather powerful entities try to stop this idea because they do not wish to take
<br>
the (perceived or real) risks. Meanwhile, only time will tell what will actually happen. For now, I will take the pessimistic
<br>
assumption and &quot;buy insurance&quot; by embarking on the Ascension Colony Project.
<br>
<p><p>If we thought pessimistically we can also feel motivated to prevent or at least to escape from the incoming problems that we
<br>
perceive. When we believe that we would strike (a rather unlikely) cosmic lottery of an asteroid strike we would start searching the
<br>
skies and devising ways to stop such nasties from happening.
<br>
<p>If we believe that, surely, all will eventually go well, we can always sit back and enjoy the show. We do not need to build asteroid
<br>
defences since &quot;statistically, the money would only go to waste&quot;. For the case of our societies, we might think: &quot;Surely, our world
<br>
would make it. Let us just go into cryo-freeze and skip the waiting&quot;.
<br>
<p><p>In fact, the signs around the world seem to show our societies have started experiencing severe stress due to the great changes
<br>
happening around us. A backlash had occurred as some people started feeling disillusioned with technology. It appears that such
<br>
people have significent power because quite a number of countries around the world had banned human cloning or research into it
<br>
(irrationally). This will certainly put a damper on Singularity and transhuman society formation.
<br>
<p>When one thinks that the story will always have a happy ending where the humans, transhumans and AIs lived happily ever after, then
<br>
we can just focus on solving the technological problems and ignore the sociological ones (since it will eventually sort itself out
<br>
anyway). If we think that we will face some great dangers and risks, we will have to go ahead and uncover these while finding ways
<br>
to mitigate or resolve them.
<br>
<p><p>In this case, I think that the biggest difference between my thinking and some of the other vocal extropians on the Net, consists of
<br>
my &quot;gut feel&quot; that the largest problems we face in the creation of a transhuman society would consist of sociological, not
<br>
technological ones. It would remain as &quot;gut feel&quot; because I cannot prove it with my current knowledge and/or abilities.
<br>
<p>Since I assumed such, I would find it wise to *focus* on sociological problems to uncover the risks and solutions to resolve them. I
<br>
would like to mitigate the risks by setting up a colony where I can always optionally escape to if things get too bad on Earth. This
<br>
comes as a bonus if things turn out good, and a neccessity if things go bad.
<br>
<p>[However, I think the majority of known proposals concerning building isolated colonies would require more serious and comprehensive
<br>
thinking before implementation.]
<br>
<p><p>I would like to say, that pessimistic people do not necessary act in an apathetic manner. If they do, they will only most likely
<br>
create self-fulfilling prophecies, which will not help much. Perhaps I has also overly generalised those of optimistic people.
<br>
<p>I think, if we have sufficient intelligence, we should forge ahead in a cautious manner, thinking in a more pessimistic manner as to
<br>
what can occur and thinking in an optimistic manner as to what will occur. We should then *act on* such thinking to ensure that our
<br>
optimistic thinking comes true rather than just believing it will *definitely* come true.
