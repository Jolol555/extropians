<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am curious as to people's opinions of Haskell as a programming language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Any comments on notable strengths or weaknesses/limitations (beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really obvious ones) would be appreciated.  Of particular interest to me are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systemic limitations that are difficult to program around, or which don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scale well conceptually.
</em><br>
<p>I think Haskell's main strength is its completely denotational approach
<br>
to types. By this I mean the way in which you define types by a mechanism
<br>
quite similar in spirit to mathematical definition by algebraic expressions,
<br>
inductive schemas, case analysis, implicit composition-decomposition,
<br>
and higher-order capabilities. This gives you a level of abstraction that is
<br>
very neat, and lends itself to concise and clear capture of the conceptual
<br>
solution your program is providing. It also allows you to do an impressive
<br>
amount of logic reasoning on the program as an object, which would allow you
<br>
to provide mathematical proof justifications of critical behaviour.
<br>
<p>I also think Haskell's main weakness is its completely denotational approach
<br>
to types. I know I'm sounding like a bad joke, but it's true in my eyes.
<br>
As much as people like me would like to crown denotational languages as
<br>
the pinnacle of programming, there are lots of real-world situations in
<br>
which this becomes a pain. Heavily operational behaviours can be coded in
<br>
a quite decent way but it requires you to deal with a lot of abstraction
<br>
for your result. This feels like a clumsy burden at times, though it is
<br>
my understanding that several years of practice with the &quot;monadic style&quot;
<br>
have produced many reasonably good pragmatic ways of going through it.
<br>
Another limitation is the module system, which is decidedly primitive
<br>
as far as module systems go.
<br>
<p>Here our research groups have created wonderful work using Haskell. The kind
<br>
of work done seems to confirm my impression: it's amazingly good for problems
<br>
that can be expressed denotationally (as an example, the proof-editor
<br>
assistant Alfa that I use for my own research), and somewhat clumsy for
<br>
problems that are more of an operational nature. An interesting research
<br>
direction that has shown relief for this clumsiness comes from dependent
<br>
type systems (with which I work for my research too, but on a more math
<br>
oriented aim). We have some working prototypes (Cayenne) but they lack
<br>
development probably. A different approach has been introducing a layer
<br>
of reactive objects, so embedding operational behaviour in a clearer
<br>
way than monadic style. The current prototype (O'Haskell) looks good.
<br>
<p>On a separate issue, I think Haskell is probably the best language to
<br>
introduce freshmen to programming. I've followed closely some teaching
<br>
experiences done by colleagues, and the difference in the quality of
<br>
learning and the scope of the mental toolkit students get seems quite
<br>
impressive compared with introducing them to programming with a
<br>
traditional operational language.
<br>
<p>In short, I think Haskell hasn't been totally able to bridge the traditional
<br>
divide &quot;denotational vs. operational&quot;, the decades-old complaint about
<br>
languages of its family based on the lambda calculus. Its systematic and
<br>
scalability limitations can be traced back to that divide, so you may find
<br>
it awesome for huge complex systems or you may find it mediocre, and it
<br>
seems to depend more on the denotational-or-operational nature of the problem
<br>
than on size or complexity.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if this was of any help, feel free to curse me for wasting
<br>
your time if I'm just babbling about stuff that you already knew. ;-)
