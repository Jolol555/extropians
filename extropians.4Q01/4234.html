<br>
<p>Hi Emlyn, thanks for your response.  You said...
<br>
<p>&quot;What I want is to continue. What I fear is the cessation of continuity.
<br>
What I can't define is exactly what it is that I am concerned with having
<br>
continue, or what continuing would exactly constitute.&quot;
<br>
<p>I outlined something in one of my original letters which I think would
<br>
satisfy both the 'continuity of consciousness' people and the 'copy is me'
<br>
people.  I think most people, like you or I, would value guaranteed
<br>
subjective immortality over tentative subjective immortality, and value
<br>
tentative subjective immortality at *no chance* of any kind of immortality.
<br>
So, in order or priorities, people may rank them this way...
<br>
<p>1) guaranteed subjective immortality
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we can not magically guarantee anything, then the safest bet
<br>
right now would be to dearly protect your body and brain for as long as
<br>
possible, maybe one having science achieve a victory of aging and disease.  
<br>
<p>2) a copy of me
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that never happens, or you should come to a tragic end, then you
<br>
may feel a copy is better than nothing, even though it is not *me* (as you
<br>
or I and Harv would suggest) then it is better for your loved ones to have
<br>
something of you still around.
<br>
<p>3) no copy, no guarantee
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously both of these options are preferable over dying.
<br>
<p>So, in my original post, I outlined this method which runs a conservative
<br>
and cautious line, and which I think would appease both the 'continuity of
<br>
consciousness' crowd and the 'copy is me' crowd...
<br>
<p>Here it is again, in case you are interested.  (perhaps I should write it up
<br>
and call it 'our best/safest bet for subjective immortality')
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------
<br>
<p>The macroscopic analogy of this would be replacing all neurons at the same
<br>
time with a copy of that neural pattern OR replacing  one neuron at a time
<br>
over a great length of time.  These two effects would, I feel, be quite
<br>
different.  Is it still me if one  neuron is replaced with a synthetic
<br>
hardware neuron?  I think so, but what if I replace 10, 100, or 10^4 or 10^5
<br>
neurons?  At  what point do we have to start considering the possibility
<br>
that it is not me but a copy of me.  Surely if only one neuron were  *not*
<br>
replaced and the rest were with a copy, then that should be considered a
<br>
copy of me, as 1 neuron is not enough to house my consciousness.  
<br>
<p>Should my neural net be slowly replaced one neuron at a time, I would not
<br>
consider this any loss to the continuity of consciousness, and, at least
<br>
with my knowledge of the subject, I would consider this to indeed be *me*  
<br>
<p>Once my neural net is replaced by hardware though, an entirely different
<br>
scenario comes into play.  I think, in the short time I  have spent thinking
<br>
about this, that a sort of 'distributed processing' would be utilized, once
<br>
your neurons have been replaced  by a hardware version on neuron at a time,
<br>
a copy could be made of your neural net, also one neuron at a time, and your
<br>
neural  net could slowly start to communicate, one neuron at a time, with
<br>
this copy.  Thus distributing your consciousness over two  hardware copies,
<br>
without (in my opinion) having to worry about the loss of continuity of
<br>
consciousness.  This could be expanded  to multiple copies with your
<br>
consciousness randomly distributed across multiple copies of your original
<br>
neural net.  If this is  the case, and no one copy of your neural net houses
<br>
more than say... 5% of your total conscious processes then damage to any one
<br>
particular net will not result in your death while still maintaining
<br>
continuity of consciousness.
<br>
<p>In conclusion, I do not find any solace in a copy of me living on, even if
<br>
it is objectively identical to me, subjectively it is  not.  So, I think,
<br>
until the above scenario is achieved, I would opt for dearly protecting the
<br>
physiological mechanism currently  housing my consciousness.
<br>
