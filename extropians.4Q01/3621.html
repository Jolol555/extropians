Ok, since I haven't been on the list long enough to see the last of these,
<br>
how about I wade in with a quick question here. [Disclaimer: I'm firmly on
<br>
the continuity side of the track for reasons of existential safety.]
<br>
<p>Thought Experiment:
<br>
<p>Case 1:
<br>
<p>1) All info on you that is necessary to make an absolutely perfect copy is
<br>
stored; same internal state in your finite state machine self. This process
<br>
happens at point A.
<br>
2) Said info is shipped to point B.
<br>
3) A duplicate of you at that point in time is created at point B.
<br>
4) Steps 1-3 happen in a smaller amount of time than it takes your internal
<br>
state to change.
<br>
5) There are now two of you. What does the identity theory say about this?
<br>
<p>Case 2:
<br>
<p>1) All info on you that is necessary to make an absolutely perfect copy is
<br>
stored; same internal state in your finite state machine self. This process
<br>
happens at point A.
<br>
2) Said info is shipped to point B.
<br>
3) A duplicate of you at that point in time is created at point B.
<br>
4) Steps 1-3 happen in a smaller amount of time than it takes your internal
<br>
state to change.
<br>
5) The original you is now destroyed.
<br>
5) There is now one of you after a short interval of there having been two
<br>
of you. Is it still you?
<br>
<p>Case 3:
<br>
<p>1) All info on you that is necessary to make an absolutely perfect copy is
<br>
stored; same internal state in your finite state machine self. This process
<br>
happens at point A.
<br>
2) You are destroyed.
<br>
3) Said info is shipped to point B.
<br>
4) Arbitary time delay occurs.
<br>
5) A duplicate of you at that earlier point in time is created at point B.
<br>
6) There is now one of you after some interval of there having been none of
<br>
you. Is it still you?
<br>
<p>Comments, thoughts, cogent analysis?
