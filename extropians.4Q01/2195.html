<p><em>&gt;&gt; The misdeeds of communists and suggestions of certain environmentalists
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; (AIDS as a good thing, etc.) support my opinion that the problem is the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; religious *style* of epistemology and ethics, not the specific beliefs.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Good point, though the separation between &quot;style&quot; and &quot;specific beliefs&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not mean one doesn't influence the other.  E.g., if one believes in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supernatural realm, then one might more readily accept irrational methods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since reason tends to not point to such a realm.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly; but I think in all these cases style overides substance.  In 
<br>
principle
<br>
a supernaturally-oriented religion would be more able to hide in the nooks and
<br>
crannnies of our ignorance.  However, most of them, particularly the
<br>
faiths of the Book (Islam-Judaism-Christianity), are tied to texts riddled
<br>
with contradictions, false claims, etc.  The Bible is more patently false than
<br>
the Communist Manifesto.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, for ideologies, such as fascism and communism, based on violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suppression, anti-rationality becomes either a method or an excuse.  An
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example of the latter is what David Ramsey Steele calls &quot;practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anti-rationalism&quot; (in his &quot;The Mystery of Fascism&quot; in _Liberty_ November
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2001).  By this, he means the view that &quot;if you want to understand and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influence behavior, you had better acknowledge that people are not primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-interested, rational calculators; they are gripped and moved by myths.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The goal being to manipulate behavior -- not to educate people out of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irrational beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>I would have to agree with that view, though not the goal.  I wouldn't call 
<br>
it 
<br>
anti-rationality.  I would reserve the term anti-rational for actors that 
<br>
attempted to reduce rational calculation and increase the importance of myth.
