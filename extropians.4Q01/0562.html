<p><p>Sure.  But spreading the beastie efficiently and not having it

again.

<p>#### While as a (moderately) experienced molecular biologist I doubt that
<br>
with 10 000$ (or even  1000 000) worth of equipment you could do much damage
<br>
today, I do believe that there will be a time (perhaps in as little as 20
<br>
years), when a well-equipped lab ( about 3 - 4x10e6 $) will be able to use
<br>
the abundant data about bacterial genomes, and the flood of data from the
<br>
genome, proteome and protein interaction projects to design new, extremely
<br>
deadly, highly infectious bugs.
<br>
<p>At that time universal surveillance of everybody by everybody might become a
<br>
conditio sine qua non of further survival of our species, unless the
<br>
friendly SI gods awaken in time to save us all.
<br>
<p>Actually, I don't think that terrorists of the current crop would be a
<br>
likely source of such a threat - after all, if a clandestine lab in a Third
<br>
World country develops such a biowepon, and deploys it by sending a &quot;suicide
<br>
sneezer&quot; to infect everybody he comes in contact with, the first jet flying
<br>
back from the target country will bring the disease back with a vengeance.
<br>
Since poor countries have few resources to counter a threat (even bio
<br>
breathing masks cost money), it would be the poor that would be
<br>
disproportionately affected. 
<br>
<p>The bioweapon attack could come when a disgruntled lab worker with a death
<br>
wish for the whole world decides to end his and everybody else's misery once
<br>
and for all.
