Ooo, ooo, a question I can answer...
<br>
<p>The odds on favorite source for the moon at this point is something
<br>
like a Mars size body crashing into the Earth very early in its history.
<br>
That knocked off a huge amount of surface material -- mostly crust and
<br>
upper mantle materials, perhaps some of the core.  I think there is still
<br>
some debate as to whether the moon has a core (if it does its fairly
<br>
small).  After all the dust settled the moon would have lost most of
<br>
any water it collected from comets (no ozone, means high UV flux
<br>
causes dissociation of H2O, loss of H, then O due to low gravity;
<br>
once it became tidally locked the temps on the sunny side is going
<br>
accelerate any gas molecules to high speed).  Lack of H2O means no
<br>
normal erosion processes.  No oceans in which to dissolve various elements.
<br>
Rapid cooling of the core means no plate tectonics, no volcanos or deep sea
<br>
vents.  So the normal &quot;concentrating&quot; processes you get on the Earth can't
<br>
happen there.  I think there are only two types of major geological
<br>
features the highlands and the mares.  I'm not positive but I believe
<br>
regions get classified as to whether they are silicate rich or titanium
<br>
rich.  Perhaps some regions where large impact craters have dug large
<br>
holes they may have exposed heaver inner materials.  The dust comes
<br>
from all the impacts sending up debris that slowly floats back down.
<br>
<p>Many of the major mineralogical concentrations found on the Earth
<br>
may have had biological inputs as well (certain enzymes need metals
<br>
so biological organisms effectively concentrate these).  That wouldn't
<br>
have occurred on the moon either.
