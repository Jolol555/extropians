I said...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If one had no &quot;bumps&quot; in the road, one would reach attometer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (10^-18 m) technology scales around ~Y2235.  If we conquer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aging in the next 30 years, this time is well within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential life expectancy of anyone currently under ~40-50 y.o.
</em><br>
<p>Picking up the most recent &quot;predictions&quot; from AMD &amp; Intel
<br>
we hit attoscale circa 2155.  The same predictions yield the
<br>
date of the nano(atomic)scale speed bump are between 2030-2035.
<br>
<p>If we are typical (a big if), then the transition time of
<br>
a civilization from &quot;primitive&quot; to &quot;singularity&quot; is between
<br>
2000-6000 years (depending upon when you want to say we
<br>
transitioned from &quot;primitive&quot; to &quot;civilized&quot;.  The &quot;L&quot;
<br>
parameter of the Drake equation (the Length of time a
<br>
civilization remains detectable by non-singularity
<br>
civilizations) would thus seem to be ~100-130 years
<br>
(assuming our radio waves started to become detectable ~1940).
<br>
You can detect civilizations post-singularity but its only
<br>
by the heat signature they would leave.  And as I believe
<br>
Nagata has pointed out there may be ways around that if
<br>
you are willing to sacrifice thought capacity for stealth
<br>
capacity (by using a star's heat signature to mask the
<br>
civilization's heat signature).
<br>
<p>The interesting question remains -- whether we hit the
<br>
nanoscale speed bump in 2030 or 2060 -- if &quot;attoscale&quot;
<br>
technology turns out to be impossible -- *what* are the
<br>
implications of that?  We don't run out of things to
<br>
do (exploring the nanoscale construction phase space
<br>
would take forever) but it does mean that some exploration
<br>
vectors will be of little use (i.e. attotech == cold fusion).
<br>
<p>Are there some good examples (science?, music?, literature?)
<br>
where the previous vectors exhausted themselves and an
<br>
entirely new direction of exploration was produced as
<br>
a result?
<br>
