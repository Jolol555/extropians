<p>A &quot;commons&quot; is an exhaustable resource.  How could the
<br>
tragedy of the commons problem occur with a resource that is
<br>
infintely duplicable?  If my cow grazes the commons, there's
<br>
less grass for your cow.  If I download your book, you still
<br>
have it and can do anything with it you could before; and
<br>
everyone else can still downloaded it and do what they want
<br>
with it.  The commons is growing, not depleting.  The age
<br>
of downloading ust makes it impossible to use copyright law
<br>
to convert some corner of the commons into private property.
<br>
<p>In fact, one might argue that patents deplete the commons
<br>
of public domain ideas, by preventing independent inventors
<br>
from placing patented ideas in the public domain (this applies
<br>
less to copyrights which only protect particular expressions
<br>
of ideas, not ideas in general like patents).  This of
<br>
course is ameliorated by the fact that patents require public
<br>
disclosure and eventual expiry--that was the original
<br>
bargain.  Whether that's a good bargain or not is certainly
<br>
arguable.
