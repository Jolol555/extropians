Hello Extropian crew:
<br>
Below are some questions I originally submitted to T.O. Morrow.  If anyone 
<br>
would like to add their own replies to my questions, please do so under each 
<br>
T.O. Morrow entry.  A bio of each contributor would also be appreciated.  
<br>
Samples are provided below.  If this mega-interview is successful, there is a 
<br>
very good chance that C-Theory (&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.ctheory.net/">http://www.ctheory.net/</a>&quot;&gt;www.ctheory.net&lt;/A&gt;) will publish this online as 
<br>
they are about to publish 2 of my other interviews.
<br>
Best regards,
<br>
Jeremy Turner (scroll down for the interview)…
<br>

<br>
QUESTIONS:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
JEREMY: As far as current paradigms go, it has been a pet-peeve of mine to 
<br>
see critiques of Virtual Reality constantly tied to the limits posed by 
<br>
“immersion”.  For example, in the seminal work “DataTrash” by Arthur and 
<br>
Marilouise Kroker, virtualization is seen as a process where the physical 
<br>
properties of the flesh are consumed or “harvested” into a partial and 
<br>
incomplete reality.  In a sense, one would become immersed in a space that is 
<br>
not equally co-existing with reality.  Therefore, some critics are saying 
<br>
that virtualization initially seduces the body through its promise of 
<br>
(immersive) escapism but eventually degrades the physical integrity of 
<br>
meatspace by retreating into a false and secondary reality.  Even today, new 
<br>
realities being built by developing and speculative technologies are being 
<br>
confused with having exclusively immersive properties.  An Extropian example 
<br>
that comes to mind is the dream of uploading our minds into an immersed 
<br>
collective-super-conscious entity. As far as I understand, this is still a 
<br>
desirable Extropian vision.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
TOMORROW: Though I cannot pretend to speak for every self-proclaimed 
<br>
Extropian, I for one do not aim at Borganization.  I certainly aim to change 
<br>
and grow, understand; I do not aim to obliterate my individuality, however.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
JEREMY: Has “immersion” become synonymous with “evolution”?  If not, do you 
<br>
see the possibility that our definition of the world “virtual” is at this 
<br>
point narrow and that a future VR will include extroverted realities that 
<br>
harmonize with the“real” rather than harvest it?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
TOMORROW:  I recognize the possibility that you describe--that virtual 
<br>
realities will always retain links with external meatspace.  And, indeed, I 
<br>
regard purely virtual realities as more a theoretical possibility than a 
<br>
likely eventuality.  But at any rate, your question concerns conditions at 
<br>
too far a remove to allow very confident claims.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
JEREMY: As of today (November 08, 2001), I have heard the news that the first 
<br>
single-molecule transistor has been developed by Bell Labs (a division of 
<br>
Lucent Technologies).  From hearing this news, I am reminded of a prediction 
<br>
by Wired Magazine (I think in 1998) that if we progress according to plan, we 
<br>
will have the first commercial nano-assembler on the market by 2004.  Given 
<br>
the current rate of technological benchmarks and breakthroughs, do you think 
<br>
that such a prediction by Wired may still be accurate?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
TOMORROW:  No, I would not bet on that prediction.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;JEREMY:  Given this, what do you think will be the first commercial 
<br>
applications of the assembler?  Do you envision any immediate 
<br>
artistic/cultural/aesthetic applications of the assembler once it is on the 
<br>
market?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
TOMORROW:  I predict the first assemblers will work mainly on materials 
<br>
manufacturing, since they offer a relatively easy first job.  For that 
<br>
reason, I do not foresee any immediate culture effects--unless you include 
<br>
recouping R&amp;D costs as part of culture!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
JEREMY: Here is an elaboration/extension on Question #2.  Since September the 
<br>
11th, there has been a lot of government money thrown towards the  U.S. 
<br>
National Nanotechnology  Initiative and Nanotech startup companies such as 
<br>
Zyvex  Corp. in Dallas.  Given the logic of the “trickle down effect”, when 
<br>
do you see this technology filtering down from the Defense and Medical 
<br>
priorities down to the level of the personal prosumer?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
TOMORROW:  I'm not really very well placed to make predictions on timetables, 
<br>
so I'll only venture a range from 2015-2050.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
JEREMY:  The Foresight Institute has given a lot of attention to cautious and 
<br>
thoughtful discussions towards the practical and moral implications of 
<br>
Nanotechnology but little foresight has happened with regards to discussions 
<br>
dealing with the future of cultural discourse once this promised technology 
<br>
has arrived..  At first glance, this may not seem too strange because the 
<br>
immediate foresight necessarily needs to deal with issues that may mold or 
<br>
destroy our environment totally.  However, the apparent lack of initiating 
<br>
any active cultural thinktank devoted to foresight may be lacking foresight 
<br>
itself as K. Eric Drexler  in his book “Engines of Creation” (1986) seemed 
<br>
to suggest that the end-goal of Nanotechnology is to create a generation of 
<br>
liberated  Performance Artists because Nanotechnology should in theory, 
<br>
provide for all our material wants and needs.  The only thing left to explore 
<br>
and maintain would ultimately  be culture.  So, what importance do you place 
<br>
the value of developing a creative thinktank at his time?  Or, do you think 
<br>
it is best for the technology to arrive first before the context is 
<br>
appropriate for thinking about the specific direction that creative 
<br>
individuals will take? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
TOMORROW:  I think Foresight has taken the correct focus.  To try to predict 
<br>
culture would at best waste time, and at worst fritter away resources better 
<br>
spent on more concrete and preliminary matters.  The very nature of culture 
<br>
renders it immune to prediction; it arises out of the interactions of free 
<br>
individuals in a particular place and time.  We can only wait and see--with 
<br>
great anticipation--what tomorrow's artists will create with 
<br>
nanotechnological tools. I think Foresight has taken the correct focus.  To
