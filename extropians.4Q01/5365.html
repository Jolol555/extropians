I was figuring a sure thing on five, with possibly about three more. One or two section labels seem to imply some test
<br>
context (possibly &quot;puzzle jargon&quot;) not available to me; so including those parts in the ratio doesn't seem cricket. 
<br>
<p>Hint: I am pretty sure the Cinque they mention wasn't in the Symbionese Liberation Army. Being able to find alternate
<br>
legitimate answers always pleased me (&quot;being smarter than the testmakers&quot;).
<br>
<p>The knee of my test contentment curve happened as I hit three. Guess i'm still an underachiever.
<br>

<br>
<p>PS: I'm trying to use no smileys for at least a week. It's part of an experiment. 
<br>
This might dry my commentary out to brushfire-inducing levels. You've been duly warned.
