From: &quot;Kai Becker&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:kmb@kai-m-becker.de?Subject=Re:%20TECHNOLOGY%20AND%20TRUST%20(LONG),%20was%20Re:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;012c01c19170$cde535c0$4e5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">kmb@kai-m-becker.de</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; My vision is to live in a society where everyone finds it absurd to carry a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun - too heavy, too uncomfortable, too dangerous and simply unnecessary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And don't tell me that's impossible. We are discussing infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life-extension, mind uploading and nanotechnology here, so what about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little extropian sociology, hm?
</em><br>
<p>What a great idea -- &quot;extropian sociology&quot;
<br>
...and how 'bout extropian sociobiology, and extropian behavioral genetics?
<br>
Of course it would be nice to live in a world without guns, and I imagine such
<br>
a world would also be without religious fanatics, wouldn't it? After all,
<br>
religious fanatics can make weapons out of anything... even airplanes. So,
<br>
before you envision a society where everyone finds it absurd to carry a gun,
<br>
better envision one where everyone finds it absurd to carry religious memes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, what about the glorious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future of &lt;you-name-it&gt; technology, when you can't use it because someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could misuse it to kill you?
</em><br>
<p>I think you've discovered the necessity of developing extropian brains before
<br>
developing other kinds of extropian technology. Just as existence precedes
<br>
essence, so glorious extropian brains precede glorious future &lt;you-name-it&gt;
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
