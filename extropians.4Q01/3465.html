<p>
Since pancritical rationalism is a warm topic on this list, some of you
<br>
might be interested in this.  Too bad Bartley isn't still around.  (Or
<br>
Popper for that matter.)  I'd like to go for the Michael Redhead lecture
<br>
alone...
<br>
<p>Too bad also there's no listing for esthetics or art.  Popper wasn't exactly
<br>
churning out tomes on the subject, but he did talk about it in his
<br>
autobiography and at least one art historian has been influenced by him,
<br>
Ernst Gombrich.
<br>
<p>Cheers!

<p>Karl Popper 2002 Centenary Congress
<br>
<p>3 July 2002 - 7 July 2002
<br>
<p>Vienna, Austria
<br>
<p>www.univie.ac.at/karlpopper2002
<br>
<p><p>Third Announcement and Call for Papers
<br>
<p>On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his birth, the city of Vienna
<br>
will host a Congress to celebrate the life and work of one of the most
<br>
influential theorists and philosophers of the 20th century: Karl Popper,
<br>
born in Vienna in 1902.  In a programme of invited lectures, symposia, and
<br>
contributed papers, the Congress plans to examine and evaluate the great
<br>
variety of Popper's thought, including his contributions to scientific
<br>
method, logic, probability theory, quantum mechanics, critical rationalism,
<br>
social philosophy, liberalism, platonism, marxism, moral philosophy, the
<br>
theory of objective knowledge, darwinism, evolutionary epistemology, the
<br>
philosophy of history, the pre-socratics, the body-mind problem, and the
<br>
psychology of learning.
<br>
<p>Some sessions of the Congress will be devoted to biographical topics,
<br>
including Popper's youthful enthusiasms in music, education, and political
<br>
action.  The City Hall will stage an exhibition devoted to his life and
<br>
times.
<br>
<p>The Congress will be held in the City Hall, and in the main building of the
<br>
University of Vienna.  The Opening Ceremony will take place under the
<br>
patronage of the President of Austria, Mr Thomas Klestil, in the afternoon
<br>
of Wednesday, 3 July 2002.  Sir Hermann Bondi, Lord Quinton, the former
<br>
Chancellor of West Germany, Mr Helmut Schmidt, and the former President of
<br>
Portugal, Mr Mario Soares, have agreed to be present as guests of honour.
<br>
<p>The scientific work of the Congress will be arranged in seven sections:
<br>
<p>1 Philosophy of the physical sciences
<br>
2 Philosophy of the biological sciences
<br>
3 Philosophy of the social sciences
<br>
4 Moral &amp; political philosophy
<br>
5 Logic &amp; scientific method
<br>
6 Epistemology &amp; metaphysics
<br>
7 Life &amp; times of Karl Popper
<br>
<p>The following have accepted invitations to give lectures and to participate
<br>
in symposia.
<br>
<p>Joseph Agassi (Tel Aviv); Daniela Bailer-Jones (Bonn); Isabella Burger
<br>
(Johannesburg); Bruce Caldwell (Greensboro); Hans-Joachim Dahms (Göttingen);
<br>
Michael Esfeld (Köln); Victor Finn (Moscow); Steve Fuller (Coventry); Evelyn
<br>

<br>
<p>Call for Papers
<br>
<p>Deadline for submissions: 15 January 2002
<br>
Notification of acceptance: 1 April 2002
<br>
<p>Contributed papers concerned with Popper's work are invited in all sections.
<br>
The Congress languages are English and German.
<br>
<p>It is recognised that many topics (for example, evolutionary epistemology,
<br>
the propensity interpretation of probability, Popper's attitude towards
<br>
social democracy) could be placed in more than one section, and that some
<br>
(for example, axiomatic geometry, music, philosophy of education) fit neatly
<br>
into no section.  Contributed papers on such topics are welcome, but authors
<br>
are asked to choose that section that seems most appropriate.  It is
<br>
expected that papers in the history of philosophy, if not better placed
<br>
elsewhere, will be submitted in section 6.  In the interest of arranging
<br>
sessions on closely related themes, the Programme Committee may move some
<br>
accepted papers between sections, but it is hoped that such interventions
<br>
will be rare.  Potential contributors are asked to bear in mind that a
<br>
period of 30 minutes will be allotted to each contributed paper, including
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>Blackboards/whiteboards, overhead projectors, and slide projectors will be
<br>
available in all lecture rooms.  If other equipment is required, please
<br>
contact the KP2002-Congress-Secretariat (address below).
<br>
<p>Guidelines for the preparation of the abstracts
<br>
<p>Abstracts should be composed in Word for Windows (as .doc or .rtf files), as
<br>
ADOBE Acrobat (.pdf) files, or as Postscript or .dvi files, and should be
<br>
confined to a single page of A4.  The preferred font is 11pt Times New
<br>
Roman.
<br>
<p>The printed part of the page should not exceed 15 cm in width and 20cm in
<br>
height, with a centred heading and wide margins.
<br>
<p>Example:
<br>
Section 6:  Epistemology &amp; Metaphysics
<br>
<p>IS CRITICAL RATIONALISM CRITICAL ENOUGH?
