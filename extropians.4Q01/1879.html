KING'S RANSOM:  How vulnerable are the Saudi royals?
<br>

<p>Issue of 2001-10-22
<br>
Posted 2001-10-16
<br>
<p>Since 1994 or earlier, the National Security Agency has been collecting
<br>
electronic intercepts of conversations between members of the Saudi Arabian
<br>
royal family, which is headed by King Fahd. The intercepts depict a regime
<br>
increasingly corrupt, alienated from the country's religious rank and file,
<br>
and so weakened and frightened that it has brokered its future by
<br>
channelling hundreds of millions of dollars in what amounts to protection
<br>
money to fundamentalist groups that wish to overthrow it.
<br>
<p>The intercepts have demonstrated to analysts that by 1996 Saudi money was
<br>
supporting Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda and other extremist groups in
<br>
Afghanistan, Lebanon, Yemen, and Central Asia, and throughout the Persian
<br>
Gulf region. &quot;Ninety-six is the key year,&quot; one American intelligence
<br>
official told me. &quot;Bin Laden hooked up to all the bad guys-it's like the
<br>
Grand Alliance- and had a capability for conducting large-scale operations.&quot;
<br>
The Saudi regime, he said, had &quot;gone to the dark side.&quot;
<br>
<p>In interviews last week, current and former intelligence and military
<br>
officials portrayed the growing instability of the Saudi regime-and the
<br>
vulnerability of its oil reserves to terrorist attack-as the most immediate
<br>
threat to American economic and political interests in the Middle East. The
<br>
officials also said that the Bush Administration, like the Clinton
<br>
Administration, is refusing to confront this reality, even in the aftermath
<br>
of the September 11th terrorist attacks.
<br>
<p>The Saudis and the Americans arranged a meeting between Defense Secretary
<br>
Donald Rumsfeld and King Fahd during a visit by Rumsfeld to Saudi Arabia
<br>
shortly before the beginning of the air war in Afghanistan, and pictures of
<br>
the meeting were transmitted around the world. The United States, however,
<br>
has known that King Fahd has been incapacitated since suffering a severe
<br>
stroke, in late 1995. A Saudi adviser told me last week that the King, with
<br>
round-the-clock medical treatment, is able to sit in a chair and open his
<br>
eyes, but is usually unable to recognize even his oldest friends. Fahd is
<br>
being kept on the throne, the N.S.A. intercepts indicate, because of a
<br>
bitter family power struggle. Fahd's nominal successor is Crown Prince
<br>
Abdullah, his half brother, who is to some extent the de-facto ruler-he and
<br>
Prince Sultan, the defense minister, were the people Rumsfeld really came to
<br>
see. But there is infighting about money: Abdullah has been urging his
<br>
fellow-princes to address the problem of corruption in the
<br>
kingdom-unsuccessfully, according to the intercepts. &quot;The only reason Fahd's
<br>
being kept alive is so Abdullah can't become king,&quot; a former White House
<br>
adviser told me.
<br>
<p>The American intelligence officials have been particularly angered by the
<br>
refusal of the Saudis to help the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. run &quot;traces&quot;-that
<br>
is, name checks and other background information-on the nineteen men, more
<br>
than half of them believed to be from Saudi Arabia, who took part in the
<br>
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. &quot;They knew that once we
<br>
started asking for a few traces the list would grow,&quot; one former official
<br>
said. &quot;It's better to shut it down right away.&quot; He pointed out that
<br>
thousands of disaffected Saudis have joined fundamentalist groups throughout
<br>
the Middle East. Other officials said that there is a growing worry inside
<br>
the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. that the actual identities of many of those
<br>
involved in the attacks may not be known definitively for months, if ever.
<br>
Last week, a senior intelligence official confirmed the lack of Saudi
<br>
coöperation and told me, angrily, that the Saudis &quot;have only one
<br>
constant-and it's keeping themselves in power.&quot;
<br>
<p>The N.S.A. intercepts reveal the hypocrisy of many in the Saudi royal
<br>
family, and why the family has become increasingly estranged from the vast
<br>
majority of its subjects. Over the years, unnerved by the growing strength
<br>
of the fundamentalist movement, it has failed to deal with the underlying
<br>
issues of severe unemployment and inadequate education, in a country in
<br>
which half the population is under the age of eighteen. Saudi Arabia's
<br>
strict interpretation of Islam, known as Wahhabism, and its use of
<br>
mutawwa'in-religious police-to enforce prayer, is rivalled only by the
<br>
Taliban's. And yet for years the Saudi princes-there are thousands of
<br>
them-have kept tabloid newspapers filled with accounts of their drinking
<br>
binges and partying with prostitutes, while taking billions of dollars from
<br>
the state budget. The N.S.A. intercepts are more specific. In one call,
<br>
Prince Nayef, who has served for more than two decades as interior minister,
<br>
urges a subordinate to withhold from the police evidence of the hiring of
<br>
prostitutes, presumably by members of the royal family. According to the
<br>
summary, Nayef said that he didn't want the &quot;client list&quot; released under any
<br>
circumstances.
<br>
<p>The intercepts produced a stream of sometimes humdrum but often riveting
<br>
intelligence from the telephone calls of several senior members of the royal
<br>
family, including Abdullah; Nayef; Sultan, whose son Prince Bandar has been
<br>
the Saudi ambassador to the United States since 1983; and Prince Salman, the
<br>
governor of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital. There was constant telephoning
<br>
about King Fahd's health after his stroke, and scrambling to take advantage
<br>
of the situation. On January 8, 1997, Prince Sultan told Bandar about a
<br>
flight that he and Salman had shared with the King. Sultan complained that
<br>
the King &quot;barely spoke to anyone,&quot; according to the summary of the
<br>
intercept, because he was &quot;too medicated.&quot; The King, Sultan added, was &quot;a
<br>
prisoner on the plane.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sultan's comments became much more significant a few days later, when the
<br>
N.S.A. intercepted a conversation in which Sultan told Bandar that the King
<br>
had agreed to a complicated exchange of fighter aircraft with the United
<br>
States that would bring five F-16s into the Royal Saudi Air Force. Fahd was
<br>
evidently incapable of making such an agreement, or of preventing anyone
<br>
from dropping his name in a money-making deal.
<br>
<p>In the intercepts, princes talk openly about bilking the state, and even
<br>
argue about what is an acceptable percentage to take. Other calls indicate
<br>
that Prince Bandar, while serving as ambassador, was involved in arms deals
<br>
in London, Yemen, and the Soviet Union that generated millions of dollars in
<br>
&quot;commissions.&quot; In a PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; interview broadcast on October 9th,
<br>
Bandar, asked about the reports of corruption in the royal family, was
<br>
almost upbeat in his response. The family had spent nearly four hundred
<br>
billion dollars to develop Saudi Arabia, he said. &quot;If you tell me that
<br>
building this whole country . . . we misused or got corrupted with fifty
<br>
billion, I'll tell you, 'Yes.'. . . So what? We did not invent corruption,
<br>
nor did those dissidents, who are so genius, discover it.&quot;
<br>
<p>The intercepts make clear, however, that Crown Prince Abdullah was insistent
<br>
on stemming the corruption. In November of 1996, for example, he complained
<br>
about the billions of dollars that were being diverted by royal family
<br>
members from a huge state-financed project to renovate the mosque in Mecca.
<br>
He urged the princes to get their off-budget expenses under control; such
<br>
expenses are known as the hiding place for payoff money. (Despite its oil
<br>
revenues, Saudi Arabia has been running a budget deficit for more than a
<br>
decade, and now has a large national debt.) A few months later, according to
<br>
the intercepts, Abdullah blocked a series of real-estate deals by one of the
<br>
princes, enraging members of the royal family. Abdullah further alarmed the
<br>
princes by issuing a decree declaring that his sons would not be permitted
<br>
to go into partnerships with foreign companies working in the kingdom.
<br>
<p>Abdullah is viewed by Sultan and other opponents as a leader who could
<br>
jeopardize the kingdom's most special foreign relationship-someone who is
<br>
willing to penalize the United States, and its oil and gas companies,
<br>
because of Washington's support for Israel. In an intercept dated July 13,
<br>
1997, Prince Sultan called Bandar in Washington, and informed him that he
<br>
had told Abdullah &quot;not to be so confrontational with the United States.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Fahd regime was a major financial backer of the Reagan Administration's
<br>
anti-Communist campaign in Latin America and of its successful proxy war in
<br>
Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. Oil money bought the Saudis enormous
<br>
political access and leverage in Washington. Working through Prince Bandar,
<br>
they have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to charities and
<br>
educational programs here. American construction and oil companies do
<br>
billions of dollars' worth of business every year with Saudi Arabia, which
<br>
is the world's largest oil producer. At the end of last year, Halliburton,
<br>
the Texas-based oil-supply business formerly headed by Vice-President Dick
<br>
Cheney, was operating a number of subsidiaries in Saudi Arabia.
<br>
<p>In the Clinton era, the White House did business as usual with the Saudis,
<br>
urging them to buy American goods, like Boeing aircraft. The kingdom was
<br>
seen as an American advocate among the oil-producing nations of the Middle
<br>
East. The C.I.A. was discouraged from conducting any risky intelligence
<br>
operations inside the country and, according to one former official, did
<br>
little recruiting among the Saudi population, which limited the United
<br>
States government's knowledge of the growth of the opposition to the royal
<br>
family.
<br>
<p>In 1994, Mohammed al-Khilewi, the first secretary at the Saudi Mission to
<br>
the United Nations, defected and sought political asylum in the United
<br>
States. He brought with him, according to his New York lawyer, Michael J.
<br>
Wildes, some fourteen thousand internal government documents depicting the
<br>
Saudi royal family's corruption, human-rights abuses, and financial support
<br>
for terrorists. He claimed to have evidence that the Saudis had given
<br>
financial and technical support to Hamas, the extremist Islamic group whose
<br>
target is Israel. There was a meeting at the lawyer's office with two F.B.I.
<br>
agents and an Assistant United States Attorney. &quot;We gave them a sampling of
<br>
the documents and put them on the table,&quot; Wildes told me last week. &quot;But the
<br>
agents refused to accept them.&quot; He and his client heard nothing further from
<br>
federal authorities. Al-Khilewi, who was granted asylum, is now living under
<br>
cover.
<br>
<p>The Saudis were also shielded from Washington's foreign-policy bureaucracy.
<br>
A government expert on Saudi affairs told me that Prince Bandar dealt
<br>
exclusively with the men at the top, and never met with desk officers and
<br>
the like. &quot;Only a tiny handful of people inside the government are familiar
<br>
with U.S.-Saudi relations,&quot; he explained. &quot;And that is purposeful.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, the
<br>
royal family has repeatedly insisted that Saudi Arabia has made no
<br>
contributions to radical Islamic groups. When the Saudis were confronted by
<br>
press reports that some of the substantial funds that the monarchy routinely
<br>
gives to Islamic charities may actually have gone to Al Qaeda and other
<br>
terrorist networks, they denied any knowledge of such transfers. The
<br>
intercepts, however, have led many in the intelligence community to conclude
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p>The Bush Administration has chosen not to confront the Saudi leadership over
<br>
its financial support of terror organizations and its refusal to help in the
<br>
investigation. &quot;As far as the Saudi Arabians go, they've been nothing but
<br>
coöperative,&quot; President Bush said at a news conference on September 24th.
<br>
The following day, the Saudis agreed to formally cut off diplomatic
<br>
relations with the Taliban leadership in Afghanistan. Eight days later, at a
<br>
news conference in Saudi Arabia with Prince Sultan, the defense minister,
<br>
Donald Rumsfeld was asked if he had given the Saudis a list of the September
<br>
11th terrorist suspects for processing by their intelligence agencies.
<br>
Rumsfeld, who is admired by many in the press for his bluntness, answered
<br>
evasively: &quot;I am, as I said, not involved with the Federal Bureau of
<br>
Investigation that is conducting the investigation. . . . I have every
<br>
reason to believe that that relationship between our two countries is as
<br>
close, that any information I am sure has been made available to the Kingdom
<br>
of Saudi Arabia.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Saudis gave Rumsfeld something in return-permission for U.S. forces to
<br>
use a command-and-control center, built before the Gulf War, in the pending
<br>
air war against the Taliban. Over the past few years, the Saudis have also
<br>
allowed the United States to use forward bases on Saudi soil for special
<br>
operations, as long as there was no public mention of the arrangements.
<br>
<p>While the intelligence-community members I spoke with praised the Air Force
<br>
and the Navy for their performance in Afghanistan last week, which did much
<br>
to boost morale in the military and among the American citizenry, they were
<br>
crestfallen about an incident that occurred on the first night of the war-an
<br>
incident that was emblematic, they believe, of the constraints placed by the
<br>
government on the military's ability to wage war during the last decade.
<br>
<p>That night, an unmanned Predator reconnaissance aircraft, under the control
<br>
of the C.I.A., was surveilling the roads leading out of Kabul. The Predator,
<br>
which costs forty million dollars and cruises at speeds as slow as eighty
<br>
miles an hour, is equipped with imaging radar and an array of infrared and
<br>
television cameras that are capable of beaming high-resolution images to
<br>
ground stations around the world. The plane was equipped with two powerful
<br>
Hellfire missiles, designed as antitank weapons. The Predator identified a
<br>
group of cars and trucks fleeing the capital as a convoy carrying Mullah
<br>
Omar, the Taliban leader. Under a previously worked-out agreement, one
<br>
knowledgeable official said, the C.I.A. did not have the authority to &quot;push
<br>
the button.&quot; Nor did the nearby command-and-control suite of the Fifth
<br>
Fleet, in Bahrain, where many of the war plans had been drawn up. Rather,
<br>
the decision had to be made by the officers on duty at the headquarters of
<br>
the United States Central Command, or CENTCOM, at MacDill Air Force Base, in
<br>
Florida.
<br>
<p>The Predator tracked the convoy to a building where Omar, accompanied by a
<br>
hundred or so guards and soldiers, took cover. The precise sequence of
<br>
events could not be fully learned, but intelligence officials told me that
<br>
there was an immediate request for a full-scale assault by fighter bombers.
<br>
At that point, however, word came from General Tommy R. Franks, the CENTCOM
<br>
commander, saying, as the officials put it, &quot;My JAG&quot;-Judge Advocate General,
<br>
a legal officer-&quot;doesn't like this, so we're not going to fire.&quot; Instead,
<br>
the Predator was authorized to fire a missile in front of the
<br>
building-&quot;bounce it off the front door,&quot; one officer said, &quot;and see who
<br>
comes out, and take a picture.&quot; CENTCOM suggested that the Predator then
<br>
continue to follow Omar. The Hellfire, however, could not target the area in
<br>
front of the building-in military parlance, it could not &quot;get a signature&quot;
<br>
on the dirt there-and it was then agreed that the missile would attack a
<br>
group of cars parked in front, presumably those which had carried Omar and
<br>
his retinue. The missile was fired, and it &quot;obliterated the cars,&quot; an
<br>
official said. &quot;But no one came out.&quot;
<br>
<p>It was learned later from an operative on the ground that Omar and his
<br>
guards had indeed been in the convoy and had assumed at the time that the
<br>
firing came from rocket-propelled grenades launched by nearby troops from
<br>
the Northern Alliance. A group of soldiers left the building and looked for
<br>
the enemy. They found nothing, and Omar and his convoy departed. A short
<br>
time later, the building was targeted and destroyed by F-18s. Mullah Omar
<br>
survived.
<br>
<p>Days afterward, top Administration officials were still seething about the
<br>
incident. &quot;If it was a fuckup, I could live with it,&quot; one senior official
<br>
said. &quot;But it's not a fuckup-it's an outrage.This isn't like you're six
<br>
years old and your mother calls you to come in for lunch and you say, 'Time
<br>
out.' If anyone thinks otherwise, go look at the World Trade Center or the
<br>
Pentagon.&quot; A senior military officer viewed the failure to strike
<br>
immediately as a symptom of &quot;a cultural issue&quot;-&quot;a slow degradation of the
<br>
system due to political correctness: 'We want you to kill the guy, but not
<br>
the guy next to him.' No collateral damage.&quot; Others saw the cultural problem
<br>
as one of bureaucratic, rather than political, correctness. Either way, the
<br>
failure to attack has left Defense Secretary Rumsfeld &quot;kicking a lot of
<br>
glass and breaking doors,&quot; the officer said. &quot;But in the end I don't know if
<br>
it'll mean any changes.&quot;
<br>
<p>A Pentagon planner also noted that some of the camps the bombers were
<br>
hitting were empty. In fact, he added, it became evident even before the
<br>
bombing that troops of the Northern Alliance had moved into many of the
<br>
unused Taliban camps. The Alliance soldiers came up with a novel way of
<br>
alerting American planners to their new location, the officer said: &quot;They
<br>
walked around holding up white sheets so when the satellites came by they're
<br>
saying, 'Hey, we're the good guys.' &quot;
<br>
<p>The American military response has triggered alarm in the international oil
<br>
community and among intelligence officials who have been briefed on a still
<br>
secret C.I.A. study, put together in the mid-eighties, of the vulnerability
<br>
of the Saudi fields to terrorist attack. The report was &quot;so sensitive,&quot; a
<br>
former C.I.A. officer told me, &quot;that it was put on typed paper,&quot; and not
<br>
into the agency's computer system, meaning that distribution was limited to
<br>
a select few. According to someone who saw the report, it concluded that
<br>
with only a small amount of explosives terrorists could take the oil fields
<br>
off line for two years.
<br>
<p>The concerns, both in America and in Saudi Arabia, about the security of the
<br>
fields have become more urgent than ever since September 11th. A former
<br>
high-level intelligence official depicted the Saudi rulers as nervously
<br>
&quot;sitting on a keg of dynamite&quot;-that is, the oil reserves. &quot;They're petrified
<br>
that somebody's going to light the fuse.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The United States is hostage to the stability of the Saudi system,&quot; a
<br>
prominent Middle Eastern oil man, who did not wish to be cited by name, told
<br>
me in a recent interview. &quot;It's time to start facing the truth. The war was
<br>
declared by bin Laden, but there are thousands of bin Ladens. They are
<br>
setting the game-the agenda. It's a new form of war. This fabulous military
<br>
machine you have is completely useless.&quot; The oil man, who has worked closely
<br>
with the Saudi leadership for three decades, added, &quot;People like me have
<br>
been deceiving you. We talk about how you don't understand Islam, but it's a
<br>
vanilla analysis. We try to please you, but we've been aggrieved for years.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Saudi regime &quot;will explode in time,&quot; he said. &quot;It has been playing a
<br>
delicate game.&quot; As for the terrorists responsible for the September 11th
<br>
attacks, he said, &quot;Now they decide the timing. If they do a similar
<br>
operation in Saudi Arabia, the price of oil will go up to one hundred
<br>
dollars a barrel&quot;-more than four times what it is today.
<br>
<p>In the nineteen-eighties, in an effort to relieve political pressure on the
<br>
regime, the Saudi leadership relinquished some of its authority to the
<br>
mutawwa'in and permitted them to have a greater role in day-to-day life. One
<br>
U.S. government Saudi expert complained last week that religious leaders had
<br>
been allowed to take control of the press and the educational system.
<br>
&quot;Today, two-thirds of the Saudi Ph.D.s are in Islamic studies,&quot; a former
<br>
Presidential aide told me. There was little attempt over the years by
<br>
American diplomats or the White House to moderate the increasingly harsh
<br>
rhetoric about the U.S. &quot;The United States was caught up in private
<br>
agreements&quot;-with the Saudi princes-&quot;while this shit was spewing in the Saudi
<br>
press,&quot; the former aide said. &quot;That was a huge mistake.&quot;
<br>
<p>A senior American diplomat who served many years in Saudi Arabia recalled
<br>
his foreboding upon attending a training exercise at the kingdom's most
<br>
prestigious military academy, in Riyadh: &quot;It was hot, and I watched the
<br>
cadets doing drills. The officers were lounging inside a suradiq&quot;-a large
<br>
pavilion-&quot;with cold drinks, calling out orders on loudspeakers. I thought to
<br>
myself, How many of these young men would follow and die for these
<br>
officers?&quot; The diplomat said he came away from his most recent tour in Saudi
<br>
Arabia convinced that &quot;it wouldn't take too much for a group of twenty or
<br>
thirty fundamentalist enlisted men to take charge. How would the kingdom
<br>
deal with the shock of something ruthless, small, highly motivated, and of
<br>
great velocity?&quot;
<br>
<p>There is little that the United States can do now, the diplomat said. &quot;The
<br>
Saudis have been indulged for so many decades.They are so spoiled. They've
<br>
always had it their way. There's hardly anything we could say that would
<br>
impede the 'majestic instancy' of their progress. We're their janissaries.&quot;
<br>
He was referring to the captives who became élite troops of the Ottoman
<br>
Empire.
<br>
<p>&quot;The policy dilemma is this,&quot; a senior general told me. &quot;How do we help the
<br>
Saudis make a transition without throwing them over the side?&quot; Referring to
<br>
young fundamentalists who have been demonstrating in the Saudi streets, he
<br>
said, &quot;The kids are bigger than the Daddy.&quot;
