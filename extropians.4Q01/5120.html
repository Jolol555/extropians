<em>&gt; As for &quot;absolute colorblindedness&quot; - hmmm, I'm not really sure what that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means, and I'm doubly unsure what the consequences of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;colorblind&quot; policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't interpret Eliezer's post as meaning that one would literally not be
<br>
aware of color. One would be aware of it, as one might be aware that a
<br>
person has a dimple in her chin. But color would not generally be a field
<br>
used for sorting people into groups.
<br>
<p>Also, I didn't get the impression Eliezer was talking about the world as it
<br>
is now. Sure, there's racism. You know it exists and factor that into your
<br>
decision making process. But that doesn't mean *you* have to sort by color,
<br>
and it surely doesn't mean you don't want to work toward a world where no
<br>
one would sort by color, any more than they'd sort by dimpled chins or the
<br>
ability to roll one's tongue.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Colorblind?  I don't know.  I keep seeing this cartoon in my head of two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people at a party, talking and laughing and maybe even flirting, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of them says to the other, &quot;Oh, you mean you're &quot;white&quot;? (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vice versa,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;black&quot;?)  Ha, ha, ha, whyyyyyyyyyy ... I didn't even *NOTICE*
</em><br>
<p>Why is that such an outrageous idea? I'd be willing to bet it happens from
<br>
time to time with Internet friendships. It's interesting to note that one
<br>
can usually tell after a while whether an Internet acquaintance is male or
<br>
female. But I've never been able to determine the color of someone's skin
<br>
without meeting them in person or seeing a photo. Maybe this means that sex
<br>
is a valid field to sort on but skin color isn't?
