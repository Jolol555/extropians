<p>The krap that I was the target of when I expressed unpopular
<br>
views on this list (for one)  was most certainly intended to be
<br>
offensive.  I am really running out of patience for this
<br>
over-intellectualizing ignoring of the obvious and the refusal
<br>
to say what sort of communication is and is not acceptable and
<br>
live by it.  What I received and what I have seen others receive
<br>
is not acceptable to me.  Some of what I myself have said when I
<br>
have lost my patience with certain individuals is also not
<br>
acceptable to me.  I will not be party to it by doing it myself
<br>
nor will I excuse, ignore or condone it when others do it.
