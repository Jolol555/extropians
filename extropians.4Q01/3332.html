<em>&gt; &gt; Quite. However, a proper examination of the Dresden incident,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifically, will show that the US only bombed the rail yards. It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the British who had firebombed the whole city the night before with HE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then incindiaries, and they did so because they wanted to &quot;beat us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it&quot;. While the US has some blame, the overwhelming blame belongs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifically to european sources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have always personally considered area bombing a war crime, but then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, if they hadn't used it, would the nazis have won?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Were *any* allied soldiers charged with war crimes after WW2?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, generally enlisted men for such things as rape, murder of
<br>
civilians, etc. General 'Bomber' Harris was not charged as such for the
<br>
Dresden fire bombing. The US has a much better record than other nations
<br>
in prosecuting its own soldiers for war crimes. The US Uniform Code of
<br>
Military Justice is the most comprehensive justice code for military
<br>
organizations and has been extensively borrowed from by other nations
<br>
military services.
<br>
<p>As for area bombing, thats a matter of debate. Some targets are
<br>
legitimate for area bombing, others are not, today. Back when there was
<br>
no *other* sort of bombing, such a standard could not be applied. Under
<br>
the Geneva Conventions, military assets are supposed to be located
<br>
distinctly apart from civilians and civilian property. Germany and Japan
<br>
pointedly ignored this rule. They also ignored the rule against using
<br>
POWs as human shields.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, I don't regard Hiroshima or Nagasaki to be primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorist acts. By late in the war, both the German and Japanese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; governments had so thoroughly mobilized and armed their societies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; preparation for invasion of their home territories that the only people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there that could be considered 'non-combatants' under the Geneva
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Conventions were those in POW camps and patients in hospitals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You know, I spent 2 minutes searching on google for &quot;hiroshima end war&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and found a lot of evidence to suggest that this is entirely wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Refer to my quote yesterday from the head of the Joint Chiefs, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever he was.
</em><br>
<p>Accounts of the event at Hiroshima by people who were schoolchildren at
<br>
the time include references to school physical education programs that
<br>
were exclusively geared toward martial arts training with weapons like
<br>
spears, how to set up booby traps, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Under the Geneva Conventions, when a combatant hides behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-combatants or in non-combatant facilities, those then become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; combatant targets as well, legally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, well, what about the &quot;highway of death&quot; out of Kuwait? Soldiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fleeing a battle are non-combatants, yet a hell of a lot of people were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massacred on that road.
</em><br>
<p>Soldiers fleeing a battle are not non-combatants, especially if they are
<br>
trying to take their weapons and loot with them. Nine out of ten
<br>
soldiers who die in battle are shot in the back during retreats.
<br>
<p>The only conditions under which a soldier is a non-combatant is if they
<br>
are wounded and drop their weapons, if they surrender and drop their
<br>
weapons, or if they are parachuting from a damaged aircraft.
