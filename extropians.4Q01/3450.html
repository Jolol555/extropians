<p>Outside of episodes rigged by Okinawa land barons, what may you be

<br>
<p>Just because we insist on trying our own soldiers in our own courts
<br>
(i.e. refusing to subject them to kangaroo courts elsewhere) doesn't

give us a bad record on a factual basis. Is there any US military trial
<br>
you can actually show was factually flawed?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As for area bombing, thats a matter of debate. Some targets are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legitimate for area bombing, others are not, today. Back when there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no *other* sort of bombing, such a standard could not be applied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hang on, I am specifically referring to the practice of considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilian factory workers as war material, and therefore legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targets. I am not referring to the British use of mass night-time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrations of bombers over military targets, with the accompanying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor aim and &quot;collateral damage&quot; I mean the actual doctrine of killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; german citizens to reduce the german capacity to wage war.
</em><br>
<p>What actual doctrine was that? Where, exactly does it say &quot;you will bomb
<br>
specifically to kill german civilians&quot;? If you are a german factory
<br>
worker, and the air raid siren goes off, but you are prevented from
<br>
leaving the production line by an SS guard with a rifle, are you
<br>
therefore killed by the bomber dropping the bomb, or the guard who
<br>
prevented you from reaching shelter?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Geneva Conventions, military assets are supposed to be located
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distinctly apart from civilians and civilian property. Germany and Japan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pointedly ignored this rule. They also ignored the rule against using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; POWs as human shields.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See above, though.
</em><br>
<p>Bombing of german factories began only after the Germans started
<br>
targeting British factories around Coventry during the Battle of
<br>
Britain. As I've said, under the Geneva conventions, when one country is
<br>
documented to have violated a particular rule, the other parties are no
<br>
longer bound by that rule under their own prerogative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Furthermore, I don't regard Hiroshima or Nagasaki to be primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrorist acts. By late in the war, both the German and Japanese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; governments had so thoroughly mobilized and armed their societies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; preparation for invasion of their home territories that the only people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there that could be considered 'non-combatants' under the Geneva
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Conventions were those in POW camps and patients in hospitals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You know, I spent 2 minutes searching on google for &quot;hiroshima end war&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and found a lot of evidence to suggest that this is entirely wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Refer to my quote yesterday from the head of the Joint Chiefs, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever he was.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Accounts of the event at Hiroshima by people who were schoolchildren at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the time include references to school physical education programs that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were exclusively geared toward martial arts training with weapons like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spears, how to set up booby traps, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure. Britain had a Home Guard, I'm sure the US had the same thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not certain that Japan would have hung on until the bitter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-invasion end.
</em><br>
<p>Given the degree to which Japanese were demonstrated to be willing to
<br>
kamakase during the Iwo Jima and Okinawa campaigns, it is highly certain
<br>
that even if just one in one hundred Japanese were willing to kamakase,
<br>
the US casualties would have been in the millions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Under the Geneva Conventions, when a combatant hides behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; non-combatants or in non-combatant facilities, those then become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combatant targets as well, legally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ah, well, what about the &quot;highway of death&quot; out of Kuwait? Soldiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fleeing a battle are non-combatants, yet a hell of a lot of people were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; massacred on that road.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Soldiers fleeing a battle are not non-combatants,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, I read that they *are* non-combatants, under the Geneva Convention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm going to have to dig this thing up and read it at some stage, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relying on journalists, which is a scary concept.
</em><br>
<p>As I actually said, which you snipped:
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; especially if they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trying to take their weapons and loot with them. Nine out of ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; soldiers who die in battle are shot in the back during retreats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I read that a total of **  4  **  shots were proven to have come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that column, which was full of kuwaiti civilians. Where did you get your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;nine out of ten&quot; figure from? This 4-shot figure came from an article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Drugs Czar McCaffery (?) recently.  I'll see if I can dig it up.
</em><br>
<p>The column was not 'full of Kuwaiti civilians'. There were some Kuwaiti
<br>
women who were being abducted as sex slaves, and there were some
<br>
Palestinian guest workers to Kuwait who had collaborated with the Iraqis
<br>
who justly feared retribution.
<br>
<p>How can you 'prove' that a shot came from that column, BTW? Do you mean
<br>
that only four shots actually struck allied aircraft? I'd buy that, but
<br>
given the poor aim of Iraqi gunners throughout the war, this implies
<br>
that there were at least 40,000 shots fired by Iraqis at allied aircraft
<br>
that missed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The only conditions under which a soldier is a non-combatant is if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are wounded and drop their weapons, if they surrender and drop their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weapons, or if they are parachuting from a damaged aircraft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if there are civilians dragged along in said flight, tough? They die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too?
</em><br>
<p>As I've repeatedly said, the Geneva Conventions say that non-combatant
<br>
human shields used by combatants are legitimate targets. Its a tough
<br>
deal, but that is what the law is.
