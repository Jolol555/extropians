[Leibniz] 
<br>
&quot;[A]lthough the whole of this life were said to be nothing but a dream 
<br>
and the physical world nothing but a phantasm, I should call this 
<br>
dream or phantasm real enough if, using reason well, we were never 
<br>
deceived by it.&quot;.
<br>
<p>[Mitch]
<br>
It from Bit perhaps? Yet, looking for analogies to help me understand, 
<br>
what is the basis of mathematics rely on, for I contend it must have 
<br>
a physical form, yes? Is the 'physical world' based not on matter and energy, 
<br>
but on information, then perhaps information is merely coherent patterns 
<br>
that pass through matter and energy? Or is information more fundamental?
<br>
<p>____________
<br>
<p>Shelly Goldstein says that &quot;information is one of the most abused terms 
<br>
in contemporary physics&quot;. 
<br>
<p>But I think that information is &quot;more fundamental&quot;. And information
<br>
has also a couple of unique peculiarity. 
<br>
<p>It's very _cheap_ to copy, to spead, to propagate, at least in non-equilibrium 
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>There is a deep _morphism_ between &quot;action&quot; and &quot;entropy&quot; (also R. Thom 
<br>
wrote about this, but his old paper in still unpublished) and between &quot;action&quot; 
<br>
and &quot;information&quot;.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I would say, with Tom Stonier [Information and the Internal Structure 
<br>
of the Universe, Springer-Verlag, London, 1990], that:
<br>
- information is a basic property of the universe, like matter and energy;
<br>
- the information contained by a system is a function of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;linkages binding simpler, into more complex units;
<br>
- the universe is organized into a hierarchy of information levels;
<br>
- the universe may end up in a state in which all matter and energy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have been converted into pure information.
<br>
<p>-s.
<br>
<p>&lt;But does Zeilinger truly believe that `&quot;quantum mechanics is about 
<br>
information''? Information is always information about something. 
<br>
Therefore, shouldn't quantum mechanics then be regarded as being 
<br>
about that something? Quantum mechanics tells us about atoms 
<br>
and chemical bonding and high-temperature superconductivity. 
<br>
Of course, it also provides us with information about these things. 
<br>
But it does so precisely because it is about the things themselves. 
<br>
And does Zeilinger really wish to deny that the change of the state vector 
<br>
that occurs during the measurement process is &quot;a real physical process'' 
<br>
even when it leads to the destruction of the possibility of interference? 
<br>
Can quantum interference be genuinely understood by invoking a 
<br>
wavefunction that is nothing more than `&quot;a representation of our knowledge''? 
<br>
Moreover, it would not be at all sensible for a theory to acknowledge that 
<br>
&quot;any statement about the world has to make reference to observation,'' 
<br>
since Zeilinger's assertion is plainly false. Statements about history are not 
<br>
statements about history books, and statements about dinosaurs are not 
<br>
statements about fossilized dinosaur bones.&gt;
