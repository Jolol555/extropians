<p><em>&gt; Well, you have definitely given it a Extropian spin, but what you are saying

</em><br>
<em>&gt; broken, It works better than the 3rd world, but it needs to be overhauled.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A new constitution needs to be written, but I daresay that with the present

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, *technology*, not nanotech is needed. We need a more transparent govt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, we need less laws, and we could get by on only a few laws passed every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year. So why not just upgrade our voting system with technology, and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the citizenry vote on all laws?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe have sunset clauses (expiration dates, like on milk) be the norm, and
<br>
any law the legislature presumes to elevate to timeless relevance would have
<br>
to have some kind of supermajority in order to pass.
<br>
<p>As a practical matter, where technology is threatening to blow the
<br>
doors off the outhouse and hose is clean is in the area of privacy and
<br>
free expression. That's why they're fighting it tooth and nail.
<br>
<p>I've said this before and will probably say it many more times: the
<br>
number one low entry cost way to defeat bloated statism/corporatism is
<br>
to use and promote the use of crypto, anonymous cash, and anonymous
<br>
communications wherever possible-- preferrably with large number of
<br>
individuals rather than with organizations (you get better bargains
<br>
that way too).
<br>
<p>As I was reading Bob Black's essays (quite a character-- he's kind of
<br>
a leftilist, but he's right on target where authoritarinism is
<br>
concerned) I came upon another way to fight dumb laws: a jury's power
<br>
to NULLIFY laws, and effectively to acquit a defendant in a criminal
<br>
case for ANY reason they collectively feel like. The best kept secret
<br>
in the legal profession. Want out of jury duty? Breathe a word of this
<br>
during jury selection, and you'll be driving back to your regularly
<br>
scheduled job within twenty minutes. So method number two is making
<br>
sure as many US citizens know about the power of nullification as
<br>
possible. For more info, see:
