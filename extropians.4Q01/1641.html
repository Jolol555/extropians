<p><em>&gt;As Larry Niven once said, &quot;Ethics change with technology.&quot;  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree that there is an ethical rule stating &quot;pay for what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;copy&quot;, but this is a very different rule than &quot;pay for what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take&quot;, and those who equate freeloading with theft will continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to find that the Napster generation are deaf to an argument that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rests on a flawed analogy.  You can tell the Napster generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that nice people tip; you can't tell them that what they do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theft, because it's not.  And besides, didn't I just finish asking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people to untangle their wishes and their predictions?
</em><br>
<p>What they do is legally defined as theft, whether &quot;they&quot; choose to
<br>
recognize it or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Uhh... this is blatantly untrue.  Freeloading may increase total
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unfairness, but it still increases wealth.  Downloading always
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increases wealth.  If the artists paid *me* to download their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;works, each download would still increase wealth.  Suppose that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have $1000, the artist has $1000, I have 0GB, and the artist has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1GB.  The following payoff matrix shows that each download
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increases real wealth:
</em><br>
<p>It most certainly does not increase wealth. If I am an artist and
<br>
the material I write to be payed for is stolen, I have gained no
<br>
wealth.
<br>
<p>Your argument translates to &quot;stealing increases wealth&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now of course you can argue that unfairness is a real economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost that decreases efficiency.  With this I agree, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether it's enough to overcome the vast wealth created by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;downloading is a separate issue.  You can argue that money paid to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the artist generates future wealth and I agree with this as well. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But in the short term, each incremental download always generates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wealth.
</em><br>
<p>Stealing valuable material still does not translate to an increase
<br>
in wealth.
