<p>What I want is to continue. What I fear is the cessation of continuity. What
<br>
I can't define is exactly what it is that I am concerned with having
<br>
continue, or what continuing would exactly constitute. The only thing I know
<br>
is that the status quo seems to fit what I want. How long the status quo
<br>
will do that, I can't say, except for some rough upper bounds, after which I
<br>
get cessation of continuity, which is not what I want.
<br>
<p>No wonder I feel edgy a lot of the time!
