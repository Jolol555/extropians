<p>Actually the cost of enforcement will undoubtably be passed on to
<br>
the consumer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How would you go after them?
</em><br>
<p>Drag them into court and sue for copyright infringement amongst
<br>
other things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You mean, CD-burners, ethernet cards, general purpose computers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Pretty much everything except the constitutionally protected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presses of the dead tree variety?
</em><br>
<p>Since these things have legitimate uses this would be a wasted
<br>
effort.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Filter WHAT? Specific ports? Specific types of protocols?  Snoop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the content ala carnivore? How would you prove beyond the faintest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibility of any doubt to me, the voter and consumer you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to convince, that my &quot;I Hate Disney&quot; website, my manuscript

<p>What makes you think this doesn't happen now? You don't think the

NSA watches backbone traffic?
<br>
<p>Difficult probably, but pass the right law and it's doable.

<p><em>&gt;You may be among the few individuals who do things motivated by

</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the compliment, life is more than economics. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; They are trying to protect their material and it's associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; revenue stream.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Of course they are. Just as I as an independent content creator
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and consumer am attempting to break their chokehold on the market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Their revenue stream is of no interest to me, just as I'm sure
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There is nothing to prevent you from creating material and
<br>
distributing it free of charge, but I don't think individuals have
<br>
the right to make that decision for other artists.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Nor does calling downloading of copyrighted material &quot;theft&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Actually being in possession of illegally copied material is
<br>
defined in the criminal code as theft.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, I haven't, but it's my own fault for not being clear enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I meant the answer to the question &quot;When is an MP3 anything but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nonexcludable, nonrival good?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The only time an MP3 is a nonexcludable nonrival good is when it is
<br>
explicitly created of independently created material and as such
<br>
the creator forgoes all claim.
<br>
<p>In other words like I said you can create your own independent work
<br>
and release it for free.
