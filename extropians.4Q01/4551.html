</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assume you mean Sydney. In fact, Australia *was* bombed during WW2 in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; At least one mini-submarine nosed around Sydney Harbour and Newcastle.

<em>&gt; I imagine that when Japanese civilians were nuked, most Aussies were

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The difference is that the victims' families knew that the Japanese

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's very troubling.
</em><br>
<p>What is troubling is the idea that a victim would shrug things off if
<br>
the aggressor nation were sufficiently sly in its attack that nobody
<br>
could directly prove that that nation funded, sheltered, trained, and
<br>
supported the group responsible for such an attack, and that nation's
<br>
government was so directly involved that the group responsible was the
<br>
actual powerhouse behind the regieme.
<br>
<p>Reminds me, though, of a time in the 30's, when a formerly democratic
<br>
state had been subverted by an agressive, violent, power mad group, and
<br>
used that state's resources to bomb a sleepy little hamlet known as
<br>
Guernica... the difference being that that state and regeime
<br>
acknowledged its involvement.
<br>
<p>How does the attacker refusing to admit its guilt make it somehow less
<br>
deserving of being brought to justice? I'd say that makes it more
<br>
deserving of a fitting justice.
