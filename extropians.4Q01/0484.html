Practical Life Extension
<br>
<p>Mostly people die from aging, diseases (endogenous and 
<br>
exogenous), accidents, violence, oppression, disasters, and 
<br>
poverty.  The general solutions include intelligence, 
<br>
learning, skills, collaboration, relationships, tools, 
<br>
resources, and attitude.
<br>
<p>The most important and demanding areas of learning are 
<br>
biomedical sciences, human interactions (group and 
<br>
individual), and learning how to learn.
<br>
<p>Biomedical sciences include aging and diseases.  For the 
<br>
elderly, aging and endogenous (internally caused) diseases 
<br>
are usually the biggest threat.  For the poor poverty is 
<br>
usually the biggest threat but they mostly die from 
<br>
contagious diseases (brought about by poor sanitation, 
<br>
overcrowding, and bad diet).  For the young and well off 
<br>
the biggest threat may be organized group violence (wars) 
<br>
or significant oppression, otherwise their biggest problem 
<br>
is also aging and endogenous diseases.
<br>
<p>If you want to help solve these problems start with your 
<br>
own psychology, health, and efficiency.  The _Authoritative 
<br>
Guide to Self Help Books_ is a good place to start.  Health 
<br>
books produced by major universities or hospitals will tell 
<br>
you plenty about general health.  I think Dean Edell 
<br>
usually gives good health advice and has a nice 
<br>
perspective.  _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_ 
<br>
and _A New Guide to Rational Living_ are good general books 
<br>
on psychology and efficiency.  A basic psychology text 
<br>
(Zimbardo for example) is also a nice place to start and 
<br>
will give you a bit of an introduction to science.  Reading 
<br>
a book on study skills first will get you through these 
<br>
books more quickly (_How to Study_ by Ron Fry is a good 
<br>
brief introduction).
<br>
<p>More later.
