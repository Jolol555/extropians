<br>
<p>Thinking about this further, escrow services came to mind. Namely,
<br>
when two countries sign a treaty, they agree on a neutral third party
<br>
as an arbitrator, and both present the arbitrator with a check for an
<br>
agreed-upon amount. The arbitrator has the resources to monitor
<br>
compliance with this treaty (and is compensated for their troubles by
<br>
the principals). If the arbitrator finds that the treaty has been
<br>
violated, it cashes the check from the side that violated it and gives
<br>
the money to the other side.
<br>
<p>Then, the sincerity level of a government entering into a treaty could
<br>
be assigned a numerical value taking into account how much money
<br>
they're putting on the line as a percentage of their tax income and
<br>
their previous history of defaults on treaties (just like S&amp;P publish
<br>
ratings for how likely governments are to default on their business
<br>
commitments).
<br>
<p>This way, an open market for international law (competing arbitration
<br>
agencies) can exist without the arbitration agencies having to be
<br>
sufficiently well armed to enforce treaties broken by, say, the US or
<br>
China. Palestinians and Israelis can continue making &quot;agreements&quot; with
<br>
each other in bad faith, but nobody will take these agreements
<br>
seriously until both sides put their money where their big mouths are.
<br>
<p>Whadja'll think?
