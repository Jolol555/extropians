</em><br>
<p><p>Just out of curiosity, why couldn't full spectral re-synthesis be used to
<br>
interpolate the data rather than using statistical models?  Not trivial, but
<br>
I'm pretty sure it would work (without thinking about it too much).
<br>
Arguably the accuracy of the high-resolution spectral re-synthesis is going
<br>
to be extremely good and properly general if you are willing to throw a
<br>
little silicon at it.  I tend to shy away from statistical models because
<br>
many, though not all, statistical models seem to be sensitive to anomalies
<br>
in the data i.e. even many of the adaptive ones are based on the &quot;expected
<br>
case&quot; and can do ugly things when they come across something unusual.  (Also
<br>
most statistical models are specific cases of a general model waiting to be
<br>
discovered in my experience.)
<br>
<p>Unrelated to this discussion, it kind of shocks me to see some of the
<br>
archaic methods of analyzing and working with time series data used in many
<br>
parts of industry and even science and engineering.  The engineering
<br>
discipline of signal processing has very mature and extremely generalized
<br>
mathematics for handling just about any aspect of generic time series data
<br>
you could want in many cases, but many of the algorithms are rarely applied
<br>
outside of that discipline.  I've applied these things in an &quot;unorthodox&quot;
<br>
manner for some projects in the past where I wow-ed people who I really
<br>
thought should have known better.  I guess being a polymath has its
<br>
advantages.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The problem with kriging, or any classical interpolation method, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the method does not preserve the observed variability of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data. In addition, those methods cannot usually be calibrated to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyzed observations. With this (which is what I think a much smarter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach), the temporal auto-correlation is honored and the observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variability of the data is conserved. A time series missing 20% of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values can be reconstructed without gaps preserving its temporal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior in a statistical sense.
</em><br>
<p><p>It should be possible to accurately re-synthesize the expected variability
<br>
in a way that preserves most of the hidden context if there is any and add
<br>
statistically correct noise if there isn't.  Obviously the reconstructed
<br>
data isn't real, but you could theoretically generate essentially correct
<br>
data behaviors by convolving the &quot;noise&quot; fingerprint back into the
<br>
reconstructed data, particularly since such information could be extracted
<br>
cheaply during the primary re-synthesis stage of the data reconstruction.
<br>
This assumes you are doing a genuine re-synthesis rather than a much
<br>
computationally cheaper form of interpolation, but it is a minor problem
<br>
even if you aren't.  There are a few existing niche applications that do
<br>
something like this already, so the idea isn't completely novel.
<br>
<p>Now, this would be computationally very expensive if your time series is
<br>
large; doing this kind of correction in real-time with simple audio data
<br>
today requires a dozen or two high-end DSPs working in parallel.  I can only
<br>
imagine how long it would take to do millions of data points on a standard
<br>
computer.  However, the reason people spend the money to be able to do this
<br>
is that the reconstruction is absolutely superb and the algorithm is very
<br>
general; it doesn't generate any noticeable anomalies in the reconstructed
<br>
data even with relatively high loss.  Ironically, most people don't use
<br>
these algorithms to add noise to data (quite the opposite), but they
<br>
certainly could, and apparently there is an application. :^)
<br>
<p>I wrote a program that did a very limited, low-resolution version of
<br>
something similar to this about five years ago for a specific analytical
<br>
purpose.  I doubt I still have the code, but it might be an interesting
<br>
mini-project to program a generalized, highly accurate, time-series
<br>
re-synthesis engine with a bunch of configurable controls.  I'm not sure
<br>
such a general tool exists, but it might be nice to have.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
