<p><p>I think you are confusing &quot;real&quot; DnB with people that have co-opted the name
<br>
(kind of like how &quot;ska&quot; was co-opted by the music industry for music that
<br>
wasn't even close).  I'm talking about some of the early pioneers, like
<br>
Talvin Singh, who was blatantly influenced by Indian music.  That said, a
<br>
lot of good DnB seems to be heavily influenced by jazz.  Jungle is related
<br>
to DnB, but the distinction as a genre isn't clear; the primary difference
<br>
is that it is about 10-15 BPM faster than DnB and Jungle sounds a little
<br>
more &quot;urban&quot; typically.  DnB and Jungle could probably be folded together
<br>
into a single genre.
<br>
<p>Proper DnB has a couple features that make it easily identifiable.  First,
<br>
it almost never has kick drum and it doesn't have a &quot;four on the floor&quot; beat
<br>
(if it does, it isn't DnB).  Second, most DnB is produced using a
<br>
combination of 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, or 7/4 drum patterns that have been mapped
<br>
into 4/4 or 3/4 time (yes, a few commercial DnB tracks are 3/4).  In fact,
<br>
that is the primary secret to the distinctive DnB drum sound:  you layer a
<br>
few sparse percussion tracks, all programmed in different unusual time
<br>
signatures.  You may have to do a little cutting and pasting to make things
<br>
fit into 4/4 time, but the abrupt breaks just add to the charm.
<br>
