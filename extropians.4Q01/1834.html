<em>&gt;Subject: Where we lost America
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Sat, 27 Oct 2001 16:31:24 -0400 (EDT)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Where it comes to civil liberties, perhaps our Acchiles Heel is this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Constitution was written in a time that more closely approximated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bricks-n-mortar classical capitalism. There was no such thing as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multinational corporation. The only rapacious supra-human entities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they had to worry about were religons and governments. And they came
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up with some solid, elegant, well thought out ways to protect humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When businesses started getting big, they managed to get themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treated as quasi-people rather than quasi-governments (the legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precedent of corporate personhood). Oops. It wouldn't have been so bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if the Constitution has prescribed guidelines on how individuals may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behave toward each other, which would therefore apply to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corporation-people. But it doesn't-- the Constitution only applies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what the Federal government can and can't do. Perhaps this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deliberately to limit the power of the Constitution itself. Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ironically, perhaps a subtle, lingering statist bias made the Framers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;focus their attention on the government and completely ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual conduct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But for whatever reason, there is no actual Constitutional reason an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual can't go out and enslave, rob, or maim another individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In a bricks-n-mortar world, this was less of a problem, because there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was a practical limit to the coercive force one individual could bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to bear on another... and the 'home court advantage' that underlies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our sense of rights and property was usually enough to deter all but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the most determined assaults. The latter could be resolved by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;judicial and executive branches of government as they arose. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system wasn't foolproof, as slavery and disenfranchisement of women
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrated-- if a type of aggression is sufficiently widespread and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entrenched, the defender's advantage against the aggressor evaporates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Such cases have become the norm rather than the exception, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explaining the litigious turn our culture has taken. There are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thousands of corporate pseudo-persons running loose that have SO much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more power than individuals that they can exercise de facto tyrannical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control over them through the mere threat of firing, lawsuit, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outright coercion. Since the rules governing how they can treat you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are legislative rather than Constitutional, they are easier to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change. You have one vote. Time-Warner/AOL has many millions. Which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;type of entity will most likely influence the legislation in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;favor?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps basement nanofactories will solve this. But only if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collusion of government and oligopolists doesn't get to pre-emptively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dictate the terms under which they are manufactured and used.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, you have definitely given it a Extropian spin, but what you are saying 
<br>
is true.  And I am thankful that other people are starting to notice what is 
<br>
happening. But its more than just corporations. Our system is somewhat 
<br>
broken, It works better than the 3rd world, but it needs to be overhauled.  
<br>
A new constitution needs to be written, but I daresay that with the present 
<br>
power money has over our govt, it could wind up worse.
<br>
Yes, *technology*, not nanotech is needed. We need a more transparent govt. 
<br>
Yes, we need less laws, and we could get by on only a few laws passed every 
<br>
year. So why not just upgrade our voting system with technology, and have 
<br>
the citizenry vote on all laws?
