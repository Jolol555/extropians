<p>Spike, you know not the horror of what you say.  As humans, our lexical
<br>
databases are not well optimized for the production of really horrible
<br>
puns, since it takes an extra effort to think of a similar sound for any
<br>
given word.  A natural-language AI with an auditory database could
<br>
routinely search for all possible puns, selecting only the *really awful*
<br>
ones for production in a conversation.  Furthermore, the rate of
<br>
production of really awful puns would probably be at least one per
<br>
paragraph.  Imagine taking the time to go over every paragraph of an
<br>
otherwise ordinary conversation and spending a few minutes per sentence
<br>
trying to think of a really awful pun.  Given an integrated punseeker
<br>
subsystem, this could be a trivial *and routine* effort for an AI.  Thus
<br>
an AI could produce *horrible* puns, all the time, during every
<br>
conversation, with no letup.  Furthermore, Moore's Law would cause the
<br>
puns to become continually worse, preventing the users from escaping even
<br>
into merciful numbness - given Moore's Law, this holds true even if an
<br>
exponentially greater amount of processing power is required for a linear
<br>
increase in pun horror.
<br>
<p>An obvious corollary is that Michael Callahan is an AI.
<br>
<p>Leaving that aside, it's clear that pun wars in the future will be much
<br>
grimmer than the relatively innocent affairs of today.  Indeed, it may be
<br>
that humanity's only chance for survival will lie in avoiding pun war
<br>
entirely, as the puns of the future will be too horrible to be used.
