</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;markets a limitation of that right?  After all, free markets are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;just people interacting as they want to interact without third
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;party interference -- buying and selling, creating, saving,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;consuming, investing, etc.  Any government intervention in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;process abrogates someone's -- often a whole class of people's --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;right to determine their selves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, most markets are not free.
</em><br>
<p>In what sense do you mean?  If you mean most existing markets have extensive
<br>
government interventions in them, I agree.  In that case, however, the
<br>
solution is obvious: remove the interventions.  In other cases where the
<br>
government has done past interventions or past nonmarket interactions took
<br>
place -- such as someone stole some money or land, then decided to be a nice
<br>
person from then on -- the case it a little tougher, though I don't think
<br>
the solution is [further] permanent government intervention...
<br>
<p>If you mean, however, that few or no real world markets hold to an abstract
<br>
standard of equilibrium, then I'd say this doesn't matter.  If individuals
<br>
are to determine themselves, then they must do so with the resources at
<br>
hand -- not wait for some perfect situation to arise before doing so.
<br>
<p>Also, I should have pointed this out earlier.  If you are for
<br>
self-determination, then any government intervention is generally
<br>
other-determination -- someone else determining you -- or vice versa.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, groups of members can act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together to influence the market to suit their own position and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore the market is also not free.
</em><br>
<p>The typical way people do this -- if they want to trump market forces that
<br>
break down inefficient collusions and the like -- is to use the government
<br>
to protect their position.  For example, American car companies lobby for
<br>
tariffs and import quotas to lessen entry into the US car market which
<br>
prevents American car buyers from determining their car choices.  There is a
<br>
literature on regulation and regulatory capture -- whereby special interests
<br>
influence or even takeover the regulating agency.  By allowing the camel's
<br>
nose of regulation into the market tent, I think you're striking an
<br>
intellectual blow here against self-determination.
<br>
<p>And just what do you think people who want to control or determine other
<br>
people will do?  They won't use the tools like this?  They already do!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Limited government can act as a check/balance on both of these.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so because what limits the government?  Markets are
<br>
self-regulating because absent coercion, people can opt out.  Someone can
<br>
decide to take her or his business elsewhere or even create another business
<br>
to enter the market.  (After all, if a company is acting inefficiently, this
<br>
is an invitation to make profits by doing what it does more efficiently --
<br>
taking its customers away from it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If you think then there should be some limit on this &quot;right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;self[-]determination,&quot; where is it?  How do we know what it is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;any particular case?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A more difficult issue and without a current easy answer. Limiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ability of individuals to alter the market is a good start.
</em><br>
<p>But how do you mean?  Markets are basically how people interact
<br>
noncoercively.  Surely, there are other ways they do so -- romantic
<br>
relationships, friendships, and social groups -- but in any such
<br>
interaction, there is going to be dialectical forces.  I decide to buy,
<br>
e.g., from a certain product from a certain store.  That influences things.
<br>
My influence might be small, but it might not be.  In any case, I'm altering
<br>
the market.  The money I spent on that product is not in my savings account,
<br>
401k, or spent on something else.
<br>
<p>I suppose you mean alter it in a way which benefits me, but why would I not?
<br>
If let's say a few of my friends and I get together and make a contract to
<br>
buy $200 a week from a certain grocer and that grocer, as part of the deal,
<br>
gives us a deep discount and gives us other favors -- maybe gives us the
<br>
first picks on stuff that comes in, first word on sales, abnormal shopping
<br>
hours, free delivery -- why is this so bad?  This is all of us determining
<br>
ourselves through mutual agreement?  Did you have some other example in
<br>
mind?
<br>
<p>People who can't or won't enter into this deal might not like the fact that
<br>
my friends and I have this position vis-a-vis the grocer, but that's just
<br>
envy, pure and simple.  It does not cut into their self-determination --
<br>
unless you believe a) people don't have a right to interact as they please
<br>
or b) only certain people have the right to self-determination (the grocer,
<br>
my friends, and I don't, the envious people do).  Of course, with the
<br>
latter, you've already said everyone has this right...
<br>
<p>It seems to me that you want a certain type of relationship and only that
<br>
type to prevail, which by itself is not bad, but it will probably have
<br>
implications that weigh against both a free market and self-determination.
<br>
In fact, if you limit people, especially people who are peacefully
<br>
interacting -- not mugging, raping, killing, defrauding -- then it would
<br>
seem you are limiting self-determination.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
