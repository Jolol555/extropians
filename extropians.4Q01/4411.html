<p>Evolution does not act on individuals, you are probably talking about
<br>
learning/adaptation. Which actually seems to be impaired in some
<br>
respects in autism - placing autists in social situations does not
<br>
usually make them better, but rather makes them feel worse.
<br>
<p>But the real issue is: is mild autism disorders like Asperger something
<br>
we should try to fix in others? 
<br>
<p>I take the position that we should strive to grow as humans, and help
<br>
others with this striving too. While a person with Asperger may not
<br>
handle certain aspects of the human world well, it is not clear that he
<br>
or she would necessarily be better off when including these aspects. it
<br>
might be preferrable to develop in one's own preferred set of
<br>
directions, even when these directions leave out many things other
<br>
people find enjoyable.
<br>
<p>If I don't find (say) eating fine food to be rewarding, do I have a
<br>
condition that should be fixed? I can live a fantastically
<br>
self-realizing life without including gourmet food in it, so there is no
<br>
point in trying to &quot;fix&quot; this condition. I might of course enjoy food
<br>
and exclaim &quot;Wow! I have missed something! How lucky I am that I took
<br>
the change, now I don't want to change back!&quot; after such a fix has been
<br>
applied, but that does not mean others have a moral obligation to apply
<br>
it on us without our consent, and that we always should seek out such
<br>
fixes. After all, creating one's life is not just about what we select
<br>
to include in ourselves, but also the choices we decide *not* to take.
