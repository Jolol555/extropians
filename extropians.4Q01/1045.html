<em>&gt; So where to set up shop, Mars or the Asteroid Belt, L-5 Colonies, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moon? How will be fund this? Can we get better technology, quickly enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a difference in the human condition?
</em><br>
<p>1. Reduce costs to get stuff into LEO, to no more than $100/pound (down
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from current ~$10000/pound).  People are doing this now.  Until this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is done, serious work towards the rest is so insanely expensive,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's like sending out colony ships to other stars a few years before
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;practical FTL warp drive is developed.  (Exception: designing what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is needed for the rest, purely an intellectual activity, can and is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being done.)
<br>
<p>2. Start up regular LEO and suborbital trips.  This can be done as part
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the tail end of 1, though it seems no organization with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology to do this has both the motivation and political ability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be able to do this.  (Boeing, Lockheed, and other commercial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;companies: have no political restrictions, but minimal motivation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, stuff like Sea Launch gets deployed to slight fanfare
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drags on implementation.  NASA and other government agencies, US
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and otherwise: motivation - cuts their costs a lot - but politically
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hamstrung.)  Therefore, a seemingly necessary prerequisite is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redevelopment of this technology by groups that can and honestly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to deliver on this.
<br>
<p>3. Industrialization.  NASA's research on commercialization of space is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;limited to that which pays off so well, it can even justify the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current cost of space access.  Once these costs are reduced enough,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however, there are certain activities that have already been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identified as potentially profitable.  Solar energy harvesting, for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instance, or helium-3 mining (currently only useful for academic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fusion research, but if that research can be completed - which can
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be helped significantly if supplies of helium-3 become available -
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the commercial fusion market opens up, likely able to absorb
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the helium-3 that can be cheaply mined and then some).
<br>
<p>4. Colonization, somewhere in Earth orbit.  Initial colony development
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- limited facilities, potential for breakdowns which might force an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evacuation - forbid permanent settlement from the get-go, but do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow for a vacation spot, like a hotel.  This can then be expanded
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to something suitable for unlimited habitation, once the technical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issues are identified and proceeds from the hotel pay to work them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out.
<br>
<p>This is only one possibility.  Asteroid mining might become feasable
<br>
around step 3...and if it does, watch for the bottoms to drop out of
<br>
metal commodity markets worldwide, yet the asteroid miners *still* make
<br>
a killing.  And, of course, there's the potential for any number of
<br>
unforseeable scientific breakthroughs once space becomes real for most
<br>
people, including most scientists.  The only things for certain are
<br>
steps 1 and 2.
