<p>
<em>&gt; So it's a little too soon to assume that the music industry as we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a corpse.
</em><br>
<p>While this author's explanations aren't very rigorous (which is to be
<br>
expected for public-consumption prose), the basic facts are hard to avoid.
<br>
Any industry that currently _relies_ on the excludability of content is
<br>
on its deathbed.  Encryption may provide a few last gasps, but it cannot
<br>
solve the basic problem (for those who see it as a problem :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This blithely assumes that the only negative consequences will be on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people everyone loves to hate, the marketers and publishers.  Somehow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative impact on the artists is overlooked here.  It would not suit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the political purpose of this essay to dwell on reduced revenues to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the creative people who make music and other content.
</em><br>
<p>The negative impact on artists will be primarily to those artists who
<br>
presently can earn a living _only_ because of excludability, because
<br>
their work isn't good enough for the other revenue models.  There may
<br>
also be some reduction in he amount of revenue earnable by great artists,
<br>
though they will certainly continue to be in demand.  He also leaves
<br>
out the _positive_ impact on artists who will be freer to make derivatives
<br>
and have a larger public domain from which to draw.  Let's not pretend
<br>
that artists &quot;create&quot; ex nihilo.  They are users of content too.
<br>
<p>In the market as a whole, demand won't change much--people still want
<br>
things as much as they wanted them before.  The market will figure out
<br>
ways to extract money from people willing to pay for it, and they'll
<br>
only be able to do that if they can deliver the goods of talented
<br>
artists.  So yes, the artists do have less to fear from free content
<br>
than do traditional &quot;publishers&quot;, but creative marketers will still
<br>
have their uses as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Other textbook public goods are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; national defense, mosquito control, and public radio.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why the adjective &quot;public&quot; in public radio?  Is there something about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public radio which makes it a public good while private radio is not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not that I can see.  Both are non-excludable and non-rival, within a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain area.  Why then would the author have mentioned public radio
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while failing to describe ordinary radio and television as public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods?  Again I think it is because it wants to lure us into accepting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a certain model of how to think of this problem.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Commercials will be a much bigger part of all content, andI
<br>
think the author doesn't want to make that obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The difference between public radio and other radio is that public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radio is government funded.  Taxes are taken from people who have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest whatsoever in public radio and used to pay for these broadcasts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With private radio and TV on the other hand, funding is provided via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercials.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, government funding of pulic radio is miniscule.  It is primarily
<br>
user and private-grant supported (the CPB throws in a few bucks to
<br>
produce programs).  I'm not sure the author is arguing for government
<br>
support here--I'm certainly not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course another entire category of public goods which has been around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for centuries is intellectual property: patents, trademarks, copyright.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again it is a curious lapse that the author does not mention these,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I believe it is because it doesn't fit into the message he is trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to send.
</em><br>
<p>Since when are copyrights and patents &quot;goods&quot; at all?  Content is the
<br>
good.  Copyrights and patents are government-created instruments
<br>
that change the _nature_ of those goods by making them excludable.  No
<br>
one actually desires copyrights or patents as an end in themselves--
<br>
people desire content and technology; copyrights and patents are a means
<br>
to that end.  Whether or not they are an effective means is a bigger
<br>
issue, but there is no argument that they are just means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If content is becoming a pure public good, it will necessitate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; radical rethinking of the recording industry's claim that copying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; content is stealing. We as a society react very differently toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unpaid use of rival versus nonrival goods. Think of the punishment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inflicted, for example, on those who steal cars versus those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; listen to public radio without contributing to the fund drives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here we see how smart he was not to mention existing forms of IP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Someone who listens to public radio without contributing is at worst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a leech.  Compare it to someone who steals patented technology, or who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraudulently uses someone else's trademark, or republishes a copyrighted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novel without a license.  Most people will think of these activities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much less favorably than the guy who doesn't pay PBS.
</em><br>
<p>But the author's point is still valid here: these opinions we have are
<br>
shaped by culture and tradition, but our gut-reactions are different.
<br>
I honestly don't think most children will react the same way to being
<br>
told that a man built a copy of another man's machine as he will to
<br>
being told that one man took the machine from the other man's house
<br>
until that child is introduced to the concept of &quot;patent&quot; and its
<br>
justifications.  Likewise, even people who _know_ that ripping a CD
<br>
is &quot;wrong&quot; under present law make jokes about it, when they would not
<br>
think of making those same jokes about people stealing actual CDs.
<br>
The things are different, and the author correctly points that out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The lawyers representing the recording and movie industry are well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aware of the threat to their business models of digital content, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they believe they have already developed the answer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; encryption. Encryption represents the music industry's last, best hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of maintaining their product as excludable. Why they are wrong, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; content protection is doomed to failure, will have to wait for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; next essay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will look forward to seeing that.  But so far I am not impressed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evenhandedness of his discussion.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that was the author's goal here.  For one thing, there's
<br>
the &quot;equal time&quot; argument: an argument against long-stand tradition and
<br>
law is itself equal time to those long-indoctrinated traditions.  Why
<br>
should he present the side of the status quo, when that side already
<br>
has the power?  I think what he's trying to do here is show how the
<br>
status quo departs from the basic realities, and I think he does that
<br>
reasonably well, even if he does wander into speculation a bit.
