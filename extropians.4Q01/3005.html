<em>&gt;Subject: Re: Breathtaking Leonids
</em><br>
<p>I'm getting pretty envious of everyone here who've been enjoying this 
<br>
wonderful display of nature in such beautiful places among treasured 
<br>
friends and family.
<br>
<p>As is typical for Leonid showers here, the sky's been cloudy for the last 
<br>
week, with winds almost strong enough to take me off my two wheels.
<br>
<p>My wife and I did head to the Phoenix Park last year where Astronomy 
<br>
Ireland usually hold a small event, and many of their members bring their 
<br>
equipment.  It was a bit chilly, and cloud made it basically a 
<br>
no-show.  Fun part was negotiating the unlit roads, being careful not to 
<br>
collide with any deer herds roaming around.
<br>
<p>Anyways, a happy and safe Thanksgiving to you all.
<br>
<p><p>James....
<br>
&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
