&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;First, I would like to point out that I did not say you really have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anton's syndrome. US just *looks* like it has it. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Oh, I understood the stated view.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Hmm, how much European history do you know? Many governments in the 30's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were extremely authoritarian and corporativist (including the US; study
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Deal), and the dominant ideologies at that time were fascism and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;socialism - if you were an intellectual and asked what the ideology of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the future were, you would most likely answer one of those. Liberals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like Popper and Hayek were fringe.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>FDR, for all his many, many, flaws was primarilly focused on employing 
<br>
Americans, so that he could get re-elected. So what America settled for in 
<br>
the 1930's was a continuous, low standard of living, based on government 
<br>
support (CCC WPA etc) versus, simply inflating the economy with investment 
<br>
capital, as what actually occured, post Dec 7the 1941. Popper and Hayek, 
<br>
though they are intellectual lights of the 20th century, had small influence 
<br>
till after 1945.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Antiamericanism has a *long* tradition in Europe by now, and is firmly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entrenched in media, politics and culture. In a way it is also a remnant
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the cold war, since (obviously) it was supported by the pro-Soviet
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left, but there is enough cultural friction even without it to keep it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going indefinitely.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am well-aware of this tendency in the Euro presses, and, like I had 
<br>
mentioned in my previous post, also cynical and paranoid myself. I cast 
<br>
stones, realizing my own lackings. Yet, I also think the United States need 
<br>
not be a victim of someone else's propaganda. We have our own dead to bury, 
<br>
and our own interests to pursue.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;As for Europe supporting the middle east, I think you should remember
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how that system was set up and how spheres of influence were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distributed; to a large extent the postwar Europe simply agreed to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support the US hegemony. The same complaints that are levelled at the 
<br>
US
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for causing the current situation can of course be aimed at Europe. As
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Saddam, again you should remember that the US supplied him with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapons during the war against Iran - it is Bin Laden all over again.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>Well, I don't suspect that if the Europeans had united, on their own, during 
<br>
the 60's and 70's, and taken a Euro- De-Galleist approach and made their own 
<br>
millitary and Force Disuasion, up to being able to retaliate against an 
<br>
invading Soviet Union, the USA would have objected. That, of course, would 
<br>
have implied the movement of money into European armies defending their own 
<br>
soil from the Warsaw Pact. I doubt if Europe would have had the political 
<br>
will to accomplish this. Europeans may have felt like puppets but they 
<br>
aren't. This is similar to American idiocies with Saudi Oil reliance.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;But there is a long intellectual history
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of lambasting the US for everything bad. The right did it too (and of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course attacked the Soviet Union even more), the left toned down the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soviet criticism and wholeheartedly criticized the US for everything it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did. This has deeply influenced media (you would be surprised how much
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newspaper articles in Sweden mainly dwell on the bad sides of US
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;society), and of course percolated into society. If you ask most Swedes,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they assume that self interest, disregarding the rest of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world, is a primary motivator for all US foreign policy.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This is merely vilianization, without facts, is it not, or being able to put 
<br>
matters in perspective, at the least? A Swedish women I remember, who married 
<br>
a physician in the USA,  both later emigrated to Sweden in the 1980's, surely 
<br>
exhibited this political attitudes you have written of. So what I am saying 
<br>
is that I am familiar with this indoctrination.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;And remember - we are your *allies*. Now think about the rest of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Not to be a total dick, but during WW2 Sweden was a neutral. ;-) Also during 
<br>
the cold war.  :o(    Heeeeeeey!!!!
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;It is also interesting to think about the current situation reflected in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a world where China has emerged as an economic superpower sometime in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 2010-2020 region (you know, the time where so much dangerous nano is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expected to be developed). Will anti-americanism still be a strong
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motivator by then? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>1. We'll see if China really emerges as an economic super-power.
<br>
2. We'll see if nanotech emerges as powerfully as hoped for.
