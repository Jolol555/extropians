&nbsp;Robot Dog 'Bugs' Inventor
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/gizmos/0,1452,47879,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/gizmos/0,1452,47879,00.html</a>
<br>
A mechanical bug toy is fighting a robotic dog for more than just space under
<br>
the Christmas tree this year. The two toys represent rival schools of thought
<br>
vying for supremacy in the quest for artificial intelligence.
<br>
Sony's Aibo dog represents the traditional approach to building &quot;intelligent&quot;
<br>
robots: give them a powerful computer for a &quot;brain.&quot; The Aibo relies on four
<br>
processors and complex programming to function in the world. It's like a
<br>
walking laptop. Add-on software, called AIBO Life, can make the fake hound
<br>
mimic emotions, instincts, growth and the ability to &quot;learn.&quot;
<br>
<p>This approach works, but it is expensive. An original model Aibo costs about
<br>
$1,500, although new models like &quot;Latte&quot; are selling for just under $1,000.
<br>
<p>Enter the upstart B.I.O. Mechanical Bugs from Hasbro, which hit toy stores in
<br>
September and sell for $40. Fans and experts say these can herd, feed, flee,
<br>
fight and even learn on their own, and seem every bit as lifelike as Sony's
<br>
far pricier mechanical hound.
<br>
<p>Christopher Byrne, a toy expert, is impressed with the technological
<br>
sophistication of the toys, which he found to be &quot;more fun&quot; than the Aibo.
<br>
<p>&quot;They're wired to learn,&quot; Byrne said. &quot;You can put it in a box, and it can be
<br>
stymied, then learn to climb out, and it will remember the next time.&quot;
<br>
<p>He expects the bugs to be especially popular with young boys, combining their
<br>
penchant for bugs, robots and battle. &quot;It's really cool to get (the bugs) to
<br>
battle each other,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Unlike Aibo, the B.I.O. bugs don't rely on a big computer brain to function.
<br>
Although the bug-bots do use some simple computer chips, their design is
<br>
actually based on robots that use only basic electronic circuitry to create
<br>
&quot;nervous networks&quot; that can behave in very lifelike ways. In short, their
<br>
genius lies in the body, and not the brain.
<br>
<p>Mark Tilden designed the toys based on his 10 years of work as a roboticist
<br>
and physicist with the federal lab in Los Alamos, New Mexico. One of his
<br>
projects was building robots that could explore the surface of Mars for NASA.
<br>
<p>The key to Tilden's approach is shedding the notion that a good robot needs a
<br>
powerful central processor -- a &quot;brain&quot; -- like humans have.
<br>
<p>&quot;Ninety-nine percent of creatures on this planet do very well without a brain
<br>
at all,&quot; Tilden said. &quot;I've tapped in to how they do that.&quot;
<br>
<p>Tilden is not the only one eschewing digital technology as the key to making
<br>
artificially intelligent robots. Over the past 15 years, other roboticists
<br>
have built very effective robots that don't require a motherboard or a hard
<br>
drive.
<br>
<p>Rodney Brooks, of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT, is well known
<br>
as the pioneer of this simpler approach, which he calls &quot;behavior-based&quot;
<br>
robotics.
<br>
<p>When he constructed his first behavior-based robot 15 years ago, Brooks'
<br>
colleagues thought it was, literally, too stupid to be worth much. &quot;I didn't
<br>
have heaps of mathematical logic,&quot; he said. &quot;They thought it couldn't be
<br>
respectable.&quot;
<br>
<p>The robot, named Gingus, was a six-legged walker. Each leg was operated by a
<br>
simple, independent circuit connected to a sensor on the foot. When the sensor
<br>
was on the ground, the circuit would instruct the leg to push down and back;
<br>
when in the air, to kick forward, and so on.
<br>
<p>With each leg working independently, Gingus was able to climb over things, and
<br>
navigate through a crowd, and do it quickly. It took Gingus only seconds to do
<br>
what its computer-based, big-brained rivals took 15 minutes of &quot;thinking&quot; to
<br>
achieve, Brooks said.
<br>
<p>&quot;The traditional AI system tries to extract info from the world, model it,
<br>
then cope in it,&quot; Brooks said, &quot;whereas behavioral systems react to the world
<br>
itself.&quot;
<br>
<p>Tilden said this direct link to the world is what gives his bug toys their
<br>
lifelike reaction to each other, people and the world, and makes them so much
<br>
fun.
<br>
<p>&quot;The cool thing about my devices is that they do what they do by themselves,&quot;
<br>
Tilden said. &quot;They have more interactive responsibility than an Aibo. If you
<br>
ignore it, it gives a death scream. If you attack the bug, it will respond to
<br>
you, based on how you play with it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unlike an Aibo, the B.I.O. bugs aren't programmed to perform complex responses
<br>
(the newest Aibo can actually respond to verbal commands). Instead, their
<br>
reactions are the result of an unpredictable stew of signals from the bug's
<br>
independent circuits and sensors.
<br>
<p>The complexity of the bugs' behavior that results from the interaction of
<br>
these relatively simple circuits is something that would &quot;take you ages to
<br>
program,&quot; Tilden said.
<br>
<p>Pat Powers is not a scientist, but as sales director at the Mondo-tronics
<br>
online robot store, he knows his robot toys. His store had a booth set up for
<br>
kids to play with the new B.I.O. bugs a few weeks ago and at the Exploratorium
<br>
in San Francisco.
<br>
<p>&quot;The kids were pretty mesmerized,&quot; Powers said. &quot;The technology is pretty
<br>
deep. Their ability to learn is pretty neat, especially for the price.&quot;
<br>
<p>There are four different &quot;species&quot; of B.I.O. bug, with differing
<br>
characteristics -- one is more aggressive, another more sturdy, another quick.
<br>
They are designed to &quot;herd&quot; with their kind and battle with other species by,
<br>
as Tilden himself put it, &quot;stomping on the other one's head.&quot;
<br>
<p>Infrared sensors allow the bugs to detect obstacles and find each other. They
<br>
work autonomously or by remote control.
<br>
<p>In the laboratory, behavior-based robots have already proven themselves more
<br>
mobile and agile in rough terrain than their more complicated -- and far more
<br>
expensive -- computer-centric rivals.
<br>
<p>University of California at Berkeley's Bob Full helped build a behavior-based
<br>
robot that is the first to be able to walk through surf at the beach. He is
<br>
also working on a robotic cockroach. The ultimate goal is to create robots for
<br>
search and rescue and space exploration.
<br>
<p>Like Tilden, Full's work has been focused on building robots with &quot;smart
<br>
bodies&quot; rather than big brains. &quot;What controls these robots is built into the
<br>
smartness of their structure, not the brain,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;In building these toys,&quot; Full said, &quot;Tilden has showed that with very simple
<br>
nervous systems, you could get robots to move in a complex environment. We've
<br>
taken this (concept) to a point where the performance is better than previous
<br>
robots. I don't think anyone believed we could have gotten this much
<br>
performance.&quot;
<br>
<p>Despite the rivalry between traditional and behavior-based robots, experts
<br>
agree that, ultimately, the robots of the future will be a combination of the
<br>
concepts underlying the B.I.O. bugs and the Aibo. They will have smart bodies
<br>
and powerful processors for a brain.
<br>
<p>&quot;The analog stuff (Tilden's design) is good as an emulation of simple living
<br>
creatures,&quot; Brooks said, &quot;but digital is going to be the way to build higher
<br>
level.&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
