<p>
I'm annoyed over the recent hashing and rehashing of the
<br>
&quot;name calling&quot; on the list.
<br>
<p>I cannot find any documentation on what is and what is
<br>
not &quot;proper behavior&quot; on the list (if someone knows where
<br>
this is, please let me know).
<br>
<p>I can however go back to the Extropian Principles --
<br>
<em>&gt; 2. Self-Transformation - Affirming continual moral, intellectual,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and physical self-improvement, through critical and creative thinking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal responsibility, and experimentation. 
</em><br>
<p>I want to bring up the &quot;personal responsibility&quot; perspective
<br>
here.  There are proper ways and improper ways to pee in the
<br>
water hole.
<br>
<p>Here is a *proper* way:
<br>
<p>&quot;I feel that you are the weakest link&quot;.
<br>
<p>Here is an *improper* way:
<br>
<p>&quot;You *are* the weakest link&quot;.
<br>
<p>The first takes personal responsibility for your &quot;feelings&quot;.
<br>
It is fine with me for people to &quot;feel&quot; almost anything.
<br>
Getting ones feelings off ones chest from time to time
<br>
may contribute to moral and physical self-improvement
<br>
(through relieving stress).  So saying something the
<br>
first way may be considered extropic.
<br>
<p>The second statement makes an assertive claim and does not
<br>
propose a any critical thought path or experiment that might be
<br>
conducted to ascertain whether it is a valid or invalid
<br>
statement.  Given the highly subjective nature of the
<br>
opinions we have of other individuals its highly questionable
<br>
whether the validity of the statement could ever be determined.
<br>
So such statements tend to be less than useful and quite
<br>
unextropic (particularly if they generate dozens of additional
<br>
unextropic messages).
<br>
<p>Now, it is of course feasible, for example using current /.
<br>
software, to create a site and subject such assertions to
<br>
a vote.  That doesn't make them true or false because as often
<br>
happens on the TV show the results of a &quot;vote&quot; do *not* always
<br>
reflect reality.
<br>
<p>If I notice people making the second type of declarative
<br>
assertions in the future, without providing an efficient
<br>
method for determining its validity, I will &lt;plonk&gt; them
<br>
for demonstrating a lack of &quot;personal responsibility&quot;.
<br>
We need to encourage the people on the list take
<br>
more *personal responsibility* for *how* they speak.
<br>
If people notice me misspeaking declaratively, please
<br>
feel free to &lt;plonk&gt; me as well.
<br>
<p>If we do not become more effective at promoting &quot;wisdom&quot;
<br>
and &quot;intelligence&quot;, I for one am not going to want an
<br>
&quot;indefinite lifespan&quot;.
<br>
<p>Robert
