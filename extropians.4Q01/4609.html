<p>Curt Adams responded:
<br>
These people really do have an experience; there is 
<br>
something going on.  By analogy with the very similar 
<br>
out-of-body experience, they aren't really traveling 
<br>
through tunnels to the light, but something does 
<br>
happen in their brains.  I should think someone 
<br>
driven by the desire to &quot;debunk&quot; religion would be 
<br>
particularly interested in a phenomenom which leaves 
<br>
people profoundly convinced of something that didn't 
<br>
happen.  NDEs often have major effects on those who 
<br>
experience them.

<p>If I had the wealth and influence sufficient for the task, I would hire a team of doctors willing to induce near-death experiences in various skeptical extropians.  And I don't mean with a powerful magnetic field either! lol  The film Flatliners is my inspiration for this.
<br>
<p>After J.R. Molloy, Curt Adams, Robert Bradbury, James Swayze, Lee Corbin, Greg Burch and myself had all recovered from the procedure, we could than have a great discussion about it!  And if after such an exploration all of you thought it merely a hallucination I would be impressed!!
<br>
<p>I suspect after such an experience that deep down some of you would tend to not be so certain anymore of oblivion at death, or the nonexistance of God.  It's too bad I can't make this challenge to you all...
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
