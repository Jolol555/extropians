Brave New Brain: Conquering Mental Illness in the Era of the Genome
<br>
Nancy C Andreasen
<br>
<a href="http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7322/1192/a">http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7322/1192/a</a>
<br>
Oxford University Press, £19.99, pp 368
<br>
<p>ISBN 0 19 514509 7
<br>
<p>In 1984 Professor Andreasen published a book called The Broken Brain: The
<br>
Biological Revolution in Psychiatry. This influenced many latter day
<br>
psychiatrists (myself included). Now Andreasen has produced a work in which
<br>
she attempts to assay the field of contemporary psychiatric research, as
<br>
psychiatry enters the 21st century, sandwiched between two major technological
<br>
developments: the sequencing of the human genome and the use of neuroimaging
<br>
to examine the structure and function of the living brain.
<br>
<p>Is there a need for such a work? Are we not already deluged by brain books?
<br>
Certainly, if there were a need then Andreasen would be a suitable guide. She
<br>
is editor of the American Journal of Psychiatry, has contributed to the
<br>
composition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, has
<br>
made significant contributions to the field of schizophrenia research, has
<br>
studied the relationship between creativity and mental illness scientifically,
<br>
and has also published early work on post-traumatic stress disorder (before it
<br>
acquired that name). So, on all levels she is amply qualified. But do we need
<br>
another book?
<br>
<p>This book differs from others in that it is written by someone who has
<br>
conducted original research, while continuing to treat patients. Andreasen can
<br>
write scientifically, while also addressing the concerns of lay people. Many
<br>
of the chapters begin with case vignettes (some of them very moving) and
<br>
throughout Andreasen see-saws between cogent descriptions of scientific
<br>
concepts and reference points that all will understanda film that deals with
<br>
schizophrenia, a novel whose character was depressed, and so on. This is a
<br>
detailed text, not a coffee table book. It explains the principles of the new
<br>
genetics, the anatomy of neurotransmitter systems, and the methodology of
<br>
brain scanning. In four chapters devoted to diseases, Andreasen explains
<br>
schizophrenia, mood disorders, dementia, and anxiety. She does not shirk
<br>
ethical dilemmas and possesses a humane voice.
<br>
<p>Where are the weaknesses? As with any book that attempts to cover a broad
<br>
field, some infelicities occur. These are probably slips of the pen: the
<br>
putamen lies lateral and not medial to the globus pallidus (p 73); reduced not
<br>
elevated serotonergic tone is associated with impulsivity and suicide (p 311);
<br>
and in the index, the name of one British psychiatrist is left floating, with
<br>
no page attribution (obsessives will find Johnstone, Eve, on p 143).
<br>
Elsewhere, the balance of Andreasen's expertise is clearly present in the
<br>
schizophrenia chapter, while that on dementia lacks the same degree of detail.
<br>
However, these are minor points. I think a lay reader, a medical student, or a
<br>
generalist who wishes to update on current psychiatry will find much that is
<br>
useful and inspiring in Brave New Brain.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
