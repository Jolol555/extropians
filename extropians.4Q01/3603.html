</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of *course*, since their own experience would feel as if it apodictically

</em><br>
<p>I was thinking more in terms of survival, replication and evolution
<br>
rather than how it would feel to the agents.  We should be able to make
<br>
predictions about their actions based on what behaviors lead to maximal
<br>
reproductive fitness.
<br>
<p>This is presumably where our own sense of identity and desire for survival
<br>
came from.  There is no a priori reason that brains have to try to stay
<br>
alive or to view their future selves as worth preserving.  Animals which
<br>
held these views were more successful.  This led to our instincts about
<br>
preservation of identity, appropriate for a world where mental replication
<br>
is not possible.  We should be able to predict what new instincts about
<br>
identity will arise in a world where such replication can happen.
<br>
<p>If backups and restores are possible, then in fact I think the
<br>
most favored behavior would be to make as many copies as possible.
<br>
Agents which adopted this behavior would tend to increase in numbers.
<br>
Of course it would depend on the costs involved but generally this would
<br>
be an attractive form of replication.
<br>
<p>Furthermore once this was established we might expect agents to be
<br>
willing to sacrifice themselves if two or more copies were to benefit
<br>
sufficiently, like ants.  We might interepret this as saying that
<br>
agents thought of their identity as encompassing the full set of their
<br>
duplicates.
<br>
<p>If however we impose the limitation that this technology cannot be used
<br>
for replication but only for duplication (as in destructive teleportation)
<br>
then I imagine that agents would evolve to act as if their successors
<br>
were as valuable as their future selves.  Adopting such behaviors would
<br>
increase the options available to an agent and improve its survival
<br>
prospects.  Hence in such a world identity would come to include the
<br>
successors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This *doesn't* mean their fallible sense of conviction is *valid*, any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a surviving soldier's faith in God supports the existence of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imaginary contrivance
</em><br>
<p>There is no valid or invalid, it is all semantics and behavior.  In asking
<br>
whether a duplicate is me, or has the same identity as me, we really
<br>
mean whether we should act as if the duplicate is me.  And the test for
<br>
such questions is, ultimately, survival.  We have our own beliefs and
<br>
mental structures based on what allowed our ancestors to survive.  In a
<br>
new world with new survival properties, new truths will become necessary.
<br>
<p>One could adopt a position today that he has a new identity every
<br>
instant, with no continuity from moment to moment.  Such a view would
<br>
lead to actions which were random, and no doubt to death in short order.
<br>
In that way we can say that this view is wrong.  There is a meaningful
<br>
sense in which we have an identity which persists over our lifetimes.
<br>
<p>This is the empirical content of the question of identity.  It is not
<br>
an empty philosophical question.  Survival gives empirical meaning to
<br>
these issues.
