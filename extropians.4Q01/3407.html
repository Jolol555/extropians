Anders is being very incisive for this phenomena. Would we say that pre-WW1 
<br>
Germany was a democracy or a republic, or was it really a 
<br>
royalist-industrialist,
<br>
oligarchy? The UK and France seemed to be more the genuine, republic; however 
<br>
in France, what the academics call &quot;ill-liberalism&quot; flourished, during the 
<br>
same period.
<br>
<p>Certainly the United States was a &quot;republic&quot; in the years prior to 1861, but 
<br>
it surely was not a democracy; with large segments of it's population being 
<br>
enslaved, and the American Indian being evicted from lands and denied rights, 
<br>
etc., (no plaudits to the Bubba Clinton speech in Georgetown).
<br>
<p>My own term for this political condition is called &quot;rump democracies&quot; or 
<br>
better yet; &quot;rump republics&quot;. I have no way yet of answering Anders request 
<br>
for some kind of indices' on how to measure democracy. Politics is certainly 
<br>
more of an art, then a science. There are questions to be answered, as 
<br>
always, on definitions.
<br>
<p>If the trend is, despite Orwell's warnings on technology and dictatorships, 
<br>
toward using technology to liberate people economically and financially, at 
<br>
least, then are we are really headed towards a democratic plutocracy? Or is 
<br>
that a democracy with all members having an investment stake? This last 
<br>
sentence puts me in mind of Moravec's Robot, is which his suggestions that a 
<br>
world in which robots manufacture all goods and most services, produce &quot;lazy&quot; 
<br>
democracies. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I think several of these examples twist the term democracy; see my other
<br>
post about the need for a stricter term. That Germany and Japan had
<br>
parliamentary systems doesn't mean they were democratic. And the forms of
<br>
democracy of Athens and Sparta were highly different from what we
<br>
currently call democracy, and I have a *very* hard time viewing the
<br>
spartan system as a democracy - it has been described as a democratic
<br>
timocratic monarchical oligarchy, and the democratic part seems to have
<br>
been fairly thin. &gt;&gt;
