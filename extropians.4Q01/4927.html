<em>&gt; Sometimes I feel as if there is a bit of undercurrent here at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times that might be expressed (if given voice) as &quot;The world and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all its problems can go hang as long as I survive and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology moves along fast enough and is accessible enough that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can continue to survive and progress personally.&quot;   This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undercurrent, to the extent it is accurate, can lead to rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glib responses to some types of problems imho.  And I agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such do us no good.  I will go further and say that I think many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them and of this &quot;me-centric&quot; attitude are great dangers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our fondest hopes.
</em><br>
<p>Now, now. I consider the hang the world provided methodology an excellent
<br>
one to follow. It stops potentially long-lived people from focusing on and
<br>
spending energy on things that really don't matter in the long term. That
<br>
the tech goes fast enough and is accessible enough specifies a society that
<br>
I wouldn't mind living in. To get to immortality is an all or nothing
<br>
proposition for the species -- either everyone goes, or no-one goes. It
<br>
requires a stable, energetic, open, progressive society to most efficiently
<br>
a) produce the necessary sort of research and b) distribute the results.
<br>
<p>For me it all comes back to the problems being, in order of importance:
<br>
<p>1) solve the aging problem
<br>
2) solve everything else
<br>
<p>Doing it any other way, or getting sidetracked at all, is just silly and a
<br>
waste of resources. Solve 1) and you're set. You have all the time in the
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>I'd consider that a large proportion of the damage being done by governments
<br>
today is done because career politicians (who constant have to find
<br>
something, anything to do to show that they are useful) focus energies on
<br>
things that just don't really matter.
<br>
<p>Governments should be small entities populated by conscripted people,
<br>
compensated at a modest rate, who must personally spend the time to gather
<br>
the resources required to enact any measure, and are permitted to carry on
<br>
with a day job. That should keep things nicely balanced. Everything that
<br>
they can't do or won't do is in the field of the private citizens
<br>
organizations, where it should be. But of course, it would take a revolution
<br>
to get that sensible state of affairs going anywhere on this planet anytime
<br>
soon.
