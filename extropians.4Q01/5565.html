<p><em>&gt; What I hear you saying is that the civilians (children, women, and men)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed &quot;collateral damage&quot; have no one to blame but themselves and should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just die in silence
</em><br>
<p>To the degree that one is &quot;aware&quot; of a hazard one is &quot;personally responsible&quot;
<br>
for tolerating its existence.
<br>
<p>*I* am aware of the hazard that comets and asteroids represent to humanity
<br>
(even though they can scarcely be labeled &quot;moral actors&quot;).  To the degree
<br>
I do not demonstrate &amp; lobby my government or send money to private
<br>
organizations (every day) to investigate and develop solutions for this
<br>
problem -- I am &quot;personally responsible&quot; for any deaths, including my
<br>
own, that may result from my inaction.
<br>
<p>I am not suggesting that anyone should &quot;die in silence&quot;.  I am suggesting
<br>
that placing the blame for their deaths on the U.S. *alone* is failing to
<br>
look at the larger picture.
<br>
<p>The people who were substantially afraid of the danger that U.S. bombing
<br>
represented *migrated* to Pakistan (or other countries)!  The people who
<br>
felt they could not survive the possible famine facing Afghanistan moved
<br>
to refuge camps.  The people who chose not to rise up and eliminate the
<br>
Soviets from Afghanistan 15 years ago set into play a complex political
<br>
chess game that created the Al Qa'eda, the Taliban, empowered bin Laden
<br>
and eventually caused the actions we see today.  If you let people use
<br>
you as a pawn -- then you are responsible for being used as a pawn.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned before -- I think the current situation in Argentina
<br>
demonstrates quite clearly what things should look like when people
<br>
are being &quot;responsible&quot; for a situation they find unacceptable.
<br>
(That doesn't mean I think they know how to fix it -- it just
<br>
means they are actively contributing to whatever solution is developed.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; _AND_ that as a citizen of the U.S. their deaths are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also my fault since I ostensibly have the power to prevent them since I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposedly control the actions of my government's current (and past) foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state modification projects.
</em><br>
<p>To the degree that you are not marching in Washington for peace -- yes --
<br>
you are responsible for them.  (Remember I'm a child of the '60s -- I *know*
<br>
the power of a generation to change government policies).  To the degree
<br>
that &quot;we&quot; (collectively) as U.S. citizens (our our parents) thought of
<br>
Russia as the &quot;Great Satan&quot; and accepted the policies of our government
<br>
to combat that &quot;evil&quot;, we share the responsibility for the current situation in
<br>
Afghanistan (and any deaths that may occur in resolving it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not buying your argument and the 40 civilians killed on Saturday and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 103 killed on Sunday aren't either.
</em><br>
<p>Those who are &quot;ignorant&quot; of the environment around them, e.g. children,
<br>
I would label &quot;innocent&quot; victims.  Anyone who has knowledge of the situation
<br>
(ranging from the Russian invasion of Afghanistan to CIA covert activities)
<br>
is responsible to the extent they simply &quot;accepted&quot; the situation.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; For some reason I was under the impression that Extropianism was a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism that had a very positive philosophy on the dignity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals as apposed to a state Social Darwinism agenda.
</em><br>
<p>It is a very positive philosophy, clearly trying to maximize human potential.
<br>
The killing of &quot;innocent&quot; civilians can hardly be viewed as extropic.  I'm
<br>
on record for stating that what we should be doing is cryonically preserving
<br>
all &quot;terrorists&quot; until the technology becomes available to determine whether
<br>
&quot;rational&quot; discussion can correct entrenched memes that are based on what should
<br>
most probably be viewed as a history of being brain washed.
<br>
<p>To the extent that that cannot be accomplished at this time, I am willing to
<br>
tolerate certain civilians being caught in the line of fire in an effort
<br>
that I hope will result in a marginal increase in my personal security.
<br>
It is pragmatic self-interest that motivates me.  I've written a paper
<br>
on the how bad bioterrorism might get -- it *is* very frightening --
<br>
and its only a fraction of the risks we face (from &quot;natural&quot; Ebola to
<br>
nuclear war to nanotech).
<br>
<p>One can adopt a principle that no &quot;innocent&quot; casualties are acceptable.
<br>
That would be one arguable &quot;extropic&quot; position.  I personally do not
<br>
feel it would be the most extropic because it would prevent taking
<br>
actions that would provide a higher level of security and would therefore
<br>
be more likely to preserve a greater number of human lives (whether they
<br>
are U.S. or Afghanistan citizens).
<br>
<p>I'm open to suggestions for better solutions.  I don't see any at this
<br>
time though.
<br>
<p>Robert
