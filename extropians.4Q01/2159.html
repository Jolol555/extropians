ANTHROPOLOGISTS, WTC, AND WAR IN AFGHANISTAN

No one really knows what value the physical and digital etchings of these 
<br>
trying days will ultimately have to scholars, but by the time preservationists 
<br>
figure it out, it'll probably be too late. So the thinking goes: Act now; 
<br>
analyze later.

The data before September 11 are more like archaeology. The markets, on 
<br>
the other hand, value the future. And in this case they are clearly predicting 
<br>
a shallow recession of short duration. The question for investors is whether 
<br>
the markets are right, or whether they are merely providing the latest 
<br>
evidence of the triumph of hope over experience.

Anthropologist Wade Davis sees one powerful culture expecting its own values 
<br>
and ways to be acknowledged as superior by less powerful cultures. Many 
<br>
North Americans implicitly assume their own society is at the front of 
<br>
the trajectory of human progress, he says.

<br>
At the American Graduate School of International Management, global management 
<br>
students (like me) were required to take a core course called &quot;International 
<br>
Political Economy&quot; (IPE). We learned many things in the course, including 
<br>
that there are major modes of thinking about the world: Nationalism, Marxism, 
<br>
Liberalism, etc. The IPE class (in which we squirmed) suggested that major 
<br>
modes of belief and action can persist despite highly visible macro events 
<br>
(e.g., war; collapse). The macro events change the situation on the ground, 
<br>
but belief systems persist within people. Because it is a global school 
<br>
with students from around the world, the MBA students at Thunderbird are 
<br>
taught to appreciate the various belief systems and their continuance. 
<br>
These managers use their appreciation and management skill to approach 
<br>
governments, corporations, and individuals, all the while assessing the 
<br>
risks and benefits of international opportunity. When I visited Khobar 
<br>
Saudi Arabia, recently,  my friend Mohammed and I had another wide-ranging 
<br>
conversation while we smoked sheesha with the guys. At one point, I sauggested 
<br>
that Americans tend to think of themselves as &quot;good guys.&quot; Mohammed responded 
<br>
that Americans were &quot;bullies.&quot; I replied that, while that sentiment probably 
<br>
is &quot;true,&quot; Americans indeed &quot;think&quot; and &quot;believe&quot; that they are good guys. 
<br>
In other words, they hold a belief system about their society and its' 
<br>
actions. Leaders or businessmen dealing with Americans, observing their 
<br>
belief system in operation, can assess risk and benefit and plan a positive 
<br>
response, a challenge, or some relationship or business offer. This is 
<br>
what is occurring in Afghanistan now. The leaders of the conflict have 
<br>
global world views (in some cases far beyond those of their constituents). 
<br>
Risk and benefit of conflict have been assessed, and there has been a direct 
<br>
challenge to a number of the relationships that exist between countries 
<br>
of the Middle East and America and Europe. With war underway, we now hear 
<br>
(from political pundits, journalists and individuals) about &quot;historical 
<br>
injustices&quot; from one side, and about &quot;justice&quot; from the other side. Although 
<br>
these sentiments are deep &quot;truth&quot; for believers, their restatement does 
<br>
little to bring peace or promote mutual economic and social benefit... 
<br>
at least for now. The deeply held beliefs and behaviors of all parties 
<br>
to the conflict will persist for a long time. Airplanes crash into WTC, 
<br>
and some say &quot;Maybe, now Americans will understand.&quot; In turn, Afghanistan 
<br>
becomes a killing field, and some say &quot;Maybe now justice will be taught.&quot; 
<br>
The deeply held belief systems and behaviors will not disappear suddenly 
<br>
because of this war, or through reportage. However, fresh nuance may be 
<br>
added to the story as a result of the quality of cessation of war. We can 
<br>
only hope that shared experience (at the conclusion of the war) will lessen 
<br>
hostility, and bring peace and promote mutual economic and social benefit 
<br>
for these societies. Three recent news articles provide some context to 
<br>
examine the macro issue of recognizing belief systems and modes of thinking. 
<br>
Learning to recognize and understand belief systems and subsequent modes 
<br>
of behavior can help us make better decisions about how to create shared 
<br>
experience:

<br>
There are many ways to view the conflict: as a contest between Western 
<br>
liberalism and Eastern fanaticism; as a struggle between the defenders 
<br>
and the enemies of authentic Islam; and as a predictable backlash against 
<br>
American villainy abroad. While useful in assessing some dimensions of 
<br>
the conflict, these cultural and political analyses obscure reality: this 
<br>
war, like most wars, is firmly rooted in geopolitical competition.

America's 17th century English Puritans were fundamentalist bigots too. 
<br>
They preached a deeply undemocratic doctrine of the elect and the damned, 
<br>
the elect being primarily those who wielded theocratic power. They massacred 
<br>
&quot;heathen&quot; Indians, and like many Muslims today they were keen on sexual 
<br>
prohibition, worried sick about the length of men's hair and over-exposed 
<br>
women. But there any parallel with the Muslim world stops. The road from 
<br>
religious fundamentalism to prosperity and the beginnings of modern American 
<br>
democracy was remarkably short.

<br>
Practitioners of the new field of world history have begun to sidestep 
<br>
or ignore questions such as hegemony and resentment in favor of what Kenneth 
<br>
Pomeranz calls &quot;reciprocal comparisons.&quot; This approach is on the verge 
<br>
of entering the mainstream of the American historical profession.
