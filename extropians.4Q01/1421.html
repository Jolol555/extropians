<p><em>&gt;The emerging global super-organism will neither lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to a totalitarian political system, nor to a &quot;Borg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-like&quot; collective that suppresses individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom and diversity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/TOTALFRE.html">http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/TOTALFRE.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Interesting web site.  The references to the Gaia cult I am not impressed by and I suppose I should not be surprised that the people
<br>
who put up this site show that their understanding of economics has not even incorporated some of the important theoretical
<br>
breakthroughs of thirty years ago.  (The Monetarist ideas of Milton Friedman for example.)  This is to say nothing of cutting edge
<br>
work in economics.
<br>
<p>They even refer to &quot;Robber Barons&quot; as if this referred to something real instead of being a creation of political propaganda.  The
<br>
men called &quot;Robber Barons&quot; were neither robbers nor barons nor any combination of the two.  When the writer compares them to Stalin,
<br>
I wonder what the thought process was and what fantastic delusions must be involved.
<br>
<p>The web site says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The complementary mechanism of integration could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen as a source of new constraints or limitations, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these are likely to restrict the freedom of powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals--such as a Stalin-like dictator or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;robber baron--and organizations to abuse the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their own ends, rather than the freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ordinary people to realize their individual ambitions.
</em><br>
<p>However, that being said, they do have a better understanding of economics than a lot of other people.  These guys seem to assume
<br>
that the market will still exist in the world they long for.  That puts them far ahead of some other thinkers in this field
<br>
especially since the market and the factors which cause it to exist, are the central factor in the phenomena they are so keenly
<br>
interested in such as, what they call &quot;integration,&quot; the &quot;superorganism&quot; and the &quot;global brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>They write:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How does the GB relate to the new economy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The market is the collective system of transactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that helps supply to match demand, and thus to fulfill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the need for products and services of the collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;customer. The traditional market is rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inefficient, requiring a huge infrastructure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;middlemen, specialized organizations such as stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exchanges and auctions, and communication channels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Internet allows all such transactions to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;place much more quickly and transparently, with less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cost and effort. This strongly reduces &quot;friction&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making the economy more efficient so that demand can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be satisfied more rapidly, more accurately, and at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lower cost. The GB will not only facilitate direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communication between buyers and sellers, but help
</em><br>
<em>&gt;buyers to find the best value (e.g. through shopping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agents to compare prices), and help sellers to get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best price (e.g. through automatic auctioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems). The net effect is that growth increases,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while inflation and economic instability decrease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moreover, there will be less waste because of unsold
</em><br>
<em>&gt;items or goods shipped far away when there is demand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around the corner.
</em><br>
<p>They are clearly grasping to try to understand a very important phenomenon which is actually occurring.  They are not just making
<br>
this up.  Some of what I have been saying about the Maitland School as an information processing system is directly related to what
<br>
they are calling by the misleading term &quot;global brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>Referring to such developments with the analogy of an organism or an insect colony is misleading.  The phenomenon is not a good
<br>
parallel to either one.  It is so different that they really should quit using the organism analogy.
<br>
<p>Of course people see any such notion as having collectivist and totalitarian implications. So do I and I was highly skeptical when
<br>
they said their &quot;super organism&quot; was not a threat to individual liberty.  The idea of human society as a single large organism does
<br>
in fact imply a centrally controlled, totalitarian society.  If a society has no central conscious control of the &quot;body&quot; of society
<br>
(the individual people), then it isn't a good analogy to an organism.  In an intelligent organism, such conscious control does
<br>
exist.  The ethics implied by the organism analogy are pure evil.  We think nothing of the death of a few skin cells and might even
<br>
scrape a few off the inside of our mouths to look at under a microscope just to see what they look like.  The cells will soon die as
<br>
a result, but so what?
<br>
<p>In the superorganism analogy, those individual cells are individual human beings and the superorganism is society.  The implication
<br>
is that society may kill off a few individuals at a whim and think nothing of it.  This is evil.  This is tyranny.  This is why
<br>
people reject this idea quickly and for good reason.
<br>
<p>As it says on the website:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The most common objection to the super-organism view
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of societyis that people tend to interpret it as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinly disguised way of promoting a totalitarian,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collectivist system. Especially the use of words such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as &quot;control&quot; and &quot;collective&quot; evokes immediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associations with stalinism, and the brutal oppression
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of individual liberties.
</em><br>
<p>And well it should evoke such associations.
<br>
<p>I am glad to discover that it really is just a bad analogy.  What is being described on that website, what they are stumbling
<br>
towards, but don't fully grasp yet, is something very different from a &quot;super organism&quot; or &quot;global brain&quot; even though those are the
<br>
words they use to describe it.  The closest analogy to it is actually human society as it presently exists.  There is really nothing
<br>
closer to it than that.  Yet the changes they are talking about are real and are transforming human society.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most important passage on the whole (rather large) website is this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Individual humans may seem similar to the cells of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social superorganism, but they are still much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent than ants or cells (Heylighen &amp; Campbell,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1995). This is especially clear if we look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remaining competition, conflicts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misunderstandings between individuals and groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus human society is still an ambivalent system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balancing between individual selfishness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective responsibility. In that sense it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more similar to organisms like slime molds or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sponges, whose cells can live individually as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collectively, than to true multicellular organisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, there seems to be a continuing trend towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global integration. As technological and social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems develop into a more closely knit tissue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions, transcending the old boundaries between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries and cultures...
</em><br>
<p>Is it really true that human interactions are becoming &quot;more closely knit&quot;?  The use of the term &quot;tissue&quot; here is just another
<br>
gratuitous effort to make the super organism idea fit.  But is there really a &quot;continuing trend towards global integration&quot; as they
<br>
call it?  There is.
<br>
<p>I have not found where they ask what is causing it.  Maybe they never asked.  Or maybe they don't know the answer.
<br>
<p>Here they ignore that question and go on to say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the social superorganism seems to turn from a metaphor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into a reality.
</em><br>
<p>Not really.  Maybe they think it will in the future.  But the reality may well be very different from what they expect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although many people tend to see the super-organism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy as a totalitarian or collectivist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology, the opposite is true: further integration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will basically increase individual freedom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity.
</em><br>
<p>There is a fundamental contradiction here and the authors don't even seem to realize it.  They keep telling us there will be more
<br>
freedom when we are all just cogs in the machine, just cells in the super organism.  They say above that further &quot;integration&quot; will
<br>
increase individual freedom.  Yet elsewhere on the same web site they say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We are living at a time when we can see the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contradiction of the constructive evolution of mankind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very clearly: it is the contradiction between human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;integration and human freedom. Integration is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolutionary necessity.
</em><br>
<p>It is the most basic logic that if there is a contradiction between what they call human &quot;integration&quot; and human freedom then it
<br>
cannot be true that more integration will lead to more freedom.  Yet they make exactly that self-contradictory statement.
<br>
<p>Obviously there have made a mistake somewhere and not all of this is true.  The idea of society as an organism has been often used
<br>
by totalitarians and totalitarians often protest that their plan will increase freedom (even though it will really destroy freedom).
<br>
So the most obvious hypothesis is that this whole thing is a new breed of collectivist totalitarianism whether the authors realize
<br>
it or not.
<br>
<p>That's what I thought at first.  But as I read it, I concluded that this was not what was wrong.  They have made two contradictory
<br>
statements.  One of them must be false.  They say &quot;integration&quot; and freedom are contradictory and they say that &quot;integration&quot; leads
<br>
to more freedom.  We may be inclined to suspect they are wrong about &quot;integration&quot; leading to more freedom.  In fact, it is the
<br>
other statement that is wrong.  The sort of voluntary, spontaneous cooperation and increasing interdependence of individual humans
<br>
which they label &quot;integration&quot; is not contradictory to freedom.
<br>
<p>What I don't think the authors realize is that the same phenomenon which makes this kind of &quot;integration&quot; compatible with freedom is
<br>
in fact the driving force behind this &quot;continuing trend towards global integration&quot; which they have identified and also the driving
<br>
force behind the &quot;technological development&quot; which they suspected as a cause of global integration.  They are wrong on that.
<br>
Technological development is not a cause of global integration.  One does not cause the other.  Rather, both are effects of some
<br>
other cause.
<br>
<p>The famous economist Ludwig Von Mises explained this phenomenon which is the cause of both of these effects in his great book,
<br>
&quot;Human Action&quot; which I happen to be in the middle of reading now.  In economic terms it is called &amp;#8220;the division of
<br>
labor.&amp;#8221;  That is to say it is the fact that it is mutually beneficial for any two people or any two billion people to divide
<br>
up their productive activities so that each individual may specialize in productive activities that he would prefer to engage in
<br>
rather than trying to fend for himself without cooperation or trade with others.
<br>
The reasons why people want to specialize in this way go beyond the field of economics and their implications are profound.  Hints
<br>
at this may be discerned in the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; by Adam Smith, but they are only the barest hints.  It was only Von Mises who
<br>
pointed out that the area of study which economists have made their own is only a small part of a much larger field of study which
<br>
previously was not formally studied by anyone and had no name.  Von Mises studied it and gave it a name.  It is the study of human
<br>
action and he called it praxeology.
<br>
Von Mises tells us that the amount of human interdependence is increasing, that it has increased throughout human history, and that
<br>
it exists when people have the freedom to choose what they will do, to own what they create and to trade the products of their
<br>
labors to others in order to gain something to benefit themselves.
<br>
Ludwig von Mises addresses this issue directly in Human Action, Chapter VIII, at the end of Section 1 regarding Human Cooperation:
<br>
&amp;#8220;The principle of the division of labor is one of the great basic principles of cosmic becoming and evolutionary change.  The
<br>
biologists were right in borrowing the concept of the division of labor from social philosophy and adapting it to their field of
<br>
investigation.  There is a division of labor between the various parts of any living organism.  There are, furthermore, organic
<br>
entities composed of collaborating animal individuals; it is customary to call metaphorically such aggregations of the ants and bees
<br>
&amp;#8220;animal societies.&amp;#8221;  But one must never forget that the characteristic feature of human society is purposeful
<br>
cooperation; society is an outcome of human action, i.e., of a conscious aiming at the attainment of ends.  No such element is
<br>
present, as far as we can ascertain, in the processes which have resulted in the emergence of the structure-function systems of
<br>
plant and animal bodies and in the operation of the societies of ants, bees and hornets.  Human society is an intellectual a
<br>
nd spiritual phenomenon.  It is the outcome of the purposeful utilization of a universal law determining cosmic becoming, viz., the
<br>
higher productivity of the division of labor.  As with every instance of action, the recognition of the laws of nature is put into
<br>
the service of man&amp;#8217;s efforts to improve his conditions.&amp;#8221;
<br>
Earlier in the same section he writes about the question of whether the interests of society or the individual are more important
<br>
and whether there is really any conflict between the two:
<br>
<p>&amp;#8220;The questions whether society or the individual is to be considered as the ultimate end, and whether the interests of society
<br>
should be subordinated to those of the individuals or the interests of the individuals to those of society are fruitless.  Action is
<br>
always action of individual men.  The social or societal element is a certain orientation of the actions of individual men.  The
<br>
category &amp;#8220;end&amp;#8221; makes sense only when applied to action.&amp;#8221;
<br>
His, point is that there are no interests of society which are different from the interests of individuals.  There is no society at
<br>
all without individuals.  I have often pointed out that society is only a collection of individuals.  Von Mises goes farther and
<br>
points out that society exists only in the particular actions of individuals.  He is right, too.  There is nothing other than the
<br>
actions of individuals cooperating which shows us that such a thing as society exists or who is a member of it.
<br>
The people who wrote the articles on the &amp;#8220;Global Brain&amp;#8221; website (not to be confused with the Global Consciousness
<br>
Project) seem to think that technology is creating a &amp;#8220;global brain&amp;#8221; that will create a more interdependent and more
<br>
closely connected society.  As I said, it is in fact the division of labor which is causing both the increasing levels of
<br>
cooperation and also the advances in technology.  Von Mises directly addresses this issue in Chapter VIII, Section 5 on the effects
<br>
of the division of labor:
<br>
&amp;#8220;The division of labor splits the various processes of production into minute tasks, many of which can be performed by
<br>
mechanical devices.  It is this fact that made the use of machinery possible and brought about the amazing improvements in technical
<br>
methods of production.  Mechanization is the fruit of the division of labor, its most beneficial achievement, not its motive and
<br>
foundation spring.&amp;#8221;You might wonder why he refers to &amp;#8220;Mechanization&amp;#8221; rather than &amp;#8220;Computerization&amp;#8221; or
<br>
&amp;#8220;machinery&amp;#8221; rather than specifically the &amp;#8220;internet&amp;#8221;.  The reason is that he wrote this before there was any
<br>
such thing.  The book I&amp;#8217;m quoting was published in 1949, but it&amp;#8217;s amazing that he is quite accurate in telling us the
<br>
reasons for the development of computer technology and the internet.  He is telling us that these technologies, indeed, nearly all
<br>
technologies, are caused by the division of labor.  The increasing interdependence of individuals in society, this new phenomenon
<br>
now called &amp;#8220;Globalization&amp;#8221; is also an effect of division of labor.  He knew that back in 1949, but the guys writing
<br>
about the &amp;#8220;Global Brain&amp;#8221; are still guessing (incorrectly) that Globalization is caused by technology.  Not at all.
<br>
Technology is a tool which makes it possible for society to operate on such a large scale, but the reason why anyone would want to,
<br>
the m
<br>
otivation is the division of labor in furtherance of the self interest of all the individuals in the world.
<br>
The idea which has gotten the &amp;#8220;Global Brain&amp;#8221; crowd so excited is that there might be some grander, collective
<br>
consciousness evolving, a mass-mind, a super brain for all humanity which will make our decisions for us more intelligently than we
<br>
ever could individually.  They look for signs of this and they find signs of exactly that.  Somehow, over the internet, people are
<br>
communicating and together they are processing far more data than any one person could.  They are doing it in such a way that even
<br>
though the individuals may not understand all the reasons for their actions, they act in ways which benefit society.  What is this
<br>
thing they have discovered?  How does it really work?  What is this &amp;#8220;super-organism&amp;#8221; which increasingly causes people to
<br>
behave in the best way for society?  Adam Smith called it the &amp;#8220;invisible hand.&amp;#8221;  It is the same phenomenon.Yes, they are
<br>
talking about cutting edge technology like making web links which work like neurons.  The electronic connections of the internet
<br>
seem like a great analogy to the human brain.  But after a real brain finishes thinking about something, it sends signals to the
<br>
muscles of the body to act.  By what means does this network the Global Brain fans adore send neural signals to anyone to actually
<br>
act?  Yes, the internet connections may relay the data, but what makes the people who receive the data want to act on it?  And they
<br>
must want to act on it because the internet compels no one and human beings have a little more independence than muscle cells.  The
<br>
price system is the only means yet devised for collating and analyzing all the relevant data for a large scale economy,
<br>
communicating that data to the people who need to act on it and motivating them to do so.  Price data is one of the main things
<br>
which is being communicated on the internet.  Yes, some people who have authority to give orders (such as mi
<br>
litary personnel) may send these instructions over the same net.  But this is the collectivist model.  This is not a &amp;#8220;Global
<br>
Brain&amp;#8221;, it is one person&amp;#8217;s brain trying to control all those under his command.  What the &amp;#8220;Global Brain&amp;#8221;
<br>
guys are talking about is an information processing system which operates spontaneously and without compromising the independence
<br>
and volition of the individuals involved in it.  As I have said for several years now, this is (without the clumsy and misleading
<br>
Global Brain analogy) the thing which many futurists have predicted using terms like &amp;#8220;decentralized network&amp;#8221;.  It is
<br>
real, it is happening and the driving force behind it is the economic forces such as division of labor and all that flows from that
<br>
such as markets, prices and trade.
<br>
There is no Global Brain.  There is, however, a global market, a global information network and a rapid move towards greater
<br>
cooperation on a global scale, greater technology and greater prosperity.  Economic forces are what is driving this.  To understand
<br>
it we should not look to unworkable analogies like the &amp;#8220;super organism&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;global brain&amp;#8221;.  Biology
<br>
cannot explain what is happening.  Economics and Praxeology already have.
