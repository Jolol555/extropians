&quot;hyper-fecund&quot; donor doctor fathered 100 children
<br>
<a href="http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/10/14/stinwenws02004.html">http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/10/14/stinwenws02004.html</a>
<br>
A story published in this week's Sunday Times alleges that a London doctor
<br>
fathered more than 100 children following artificial insemination (AI). It is
<br>
said that the late Derek Richter, a neuropsychologist, donated sperm on many
<br>
occasions between 1945 and 1951, for use by Mary Barton, a doctor who
<br>
'pioneered' the use of artificial insemination in the 1930s.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barton revealed what she was doing via an article in the British Medical
<br>
Journal in 1945 but was met with many unfavourable responses, both from the
<br>
medical establishment and the public.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information has now come to light because Richter's daughter wrote an
<br>
article for a newsletter published by the Donor Conception Network (DCN). She
<br>
said that 'after three years he was one of their champion donors. He had
<br>
fathered his first hundred... his samples were hyper-fecund'. The DCN believe
<br>
that this might not be an isolated case, and that other academics may have
<br>
secretly donated sperm in the early days of AI.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Rollin, a friend of Richter, remembered him sending off samples. He
<br>
said 'he knew he was a superior person intellectually speaking, and I am
<br>
pretty certain that proliferating his genes was his basic reason for donating
<br>
sperm'.
<br>

<p>Richter's daughter, 63, a writer who lives in the Midlands, is one of three
legitimate children that he sired. She admits that she is curious to know
about her extraordinary number of unidentified half-brothers and sisters and
believes her family may have already encountered two of them.
<p>&quot;One of them was a young researcher working in a laboratory with my husband,
who is a geneticist, and the other was a student with my sister at Oxford,&quot;
she said. &quot;You cannot possibly ask because most people would not know they had
been conceived in this way.&quot;
<p>Henry Rollin, a retired psychiatrist from Surrey who was a colleague of
Richter, recalled his friend regularly rushing to the post to dispatch his
latest sperm sample.
<p>Barton, who has since also died, pioneered donor sperm use from 1939 onwards,
having studied the use of artificial insemination in farm animals. Richter
knew her socially and donated sperm between 1945 and 1951, which means that
his unwitting offspring are now all aged 50 to 56.
<p>Barton first revealed details of the treatment to a horrified medical
establishment via an article in the British Medical Journal in 1945. The
journal subsequently published a series of outraged letters accusing her of
treating people like cattle. &quot;What type of individual can the donor be who
hawks his seminal fluid round the countryside?&quot; one of them asked.
<p>About 2,000 children a year are now born from artificial insemination with
sperm from anonymous donors. Those born before 1990 currently have no legal
right to examine the medical records detailing their conception.
<p>The DCN is demanding that doctors offering donor insemination be required to
give greater consideration to the emotions of the children who result from the
procedure.
<p>&quot;We want to move to a more open system whereby offspring can contact their
donor parents if they want to,&quot; said Olivia Montuschi, a spokesman for the
DCN.
<p>&quot;Like adoption, not knowing about origins causes a great deal of pain for some
people.&quot;
<p>Since 1990, when the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act came into force
regulating infertility treatment, the number of offspring has been limited to
10 per donor.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
 consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
