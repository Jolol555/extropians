<p><em>&gt; I do see the overall statement you are trying very hard to make.  But,

</em><br>
<p>Lets look at R&amp;D funding...
<br>
The NIH is at ~$15 Billion/yr, another $15 Billion in Big-Pharma funding,
<br>
<em>&gt; $25 Billion/yr in the semiconductor industry, $2 Billion for DARPA,
</em><br>
perhaps $5-10 Billion/yr in VC funding for technology development that
<br>
might be considered quite extropic (compared to $50-70 Billion/yr total).
<br>
<p>I bet worldwide, the total spending on developments related to an
<br>
extropian's core interests is between $100-$150 Billion/yr.
<br>
<p>What the &quot;ideological opponents&quot; don't recognize is they have to
<br>
stop this juggernaut completely.  Technology development is like
<br>
climbing a mountain.  There many be any number of paths you can take
<br>
to get to the top.  While the transhumanist &quot;publicity machine&quot; is not
<br>
as well developed as theirs -- our core agenda is in much better shape.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned to Greg yesterday, a ban on cloning actually *helps*
<br>
my current business strategy (a ban on the use of &quot;natural&quot; stem-cells
<br>
cloned from an individual would promote the use of &quot;synthetic&quot; stem-cells).
