</em><br>
<p>The recent &quot;cloning scare&quot; that genetic engineering and cloning
<br>
techniques will allow us to produce &quot;designer humans&quot; is why
<br>
we might measure reproductive success solely on the basis of whether
<br>
offspring live long enough to produce offspring -- basically,
<br>
pass on their genetic material into the next generation so that
<br>
there's representation in the population of their genes.
<br>
<p>How are the two ideas relevant?
<br>
<p>Currently, you ensure your genes will survive by reproducing.
<br>
If you want your genes to become the majority in the gene pool,
<br>
you do this in two ways:  out-reproducing everyone else, and/or
<br>
eliminating others from the gene pool.  Cloning/GE introduces
<br>
a third option.
<br>
<p>The fear is that through cloning/GE, there will be an artificial
<br>
imbalance in the way genetic populations evolve and self-regulate.
<br>
Population will be over-run by &quot;designer humans&quot;, potentially
<br>
those who have genetics that are not naturally possible via
<br>
reproduction.
<br>
<p>One of the things keeping this aspect in check is indeed
<br>
social influence: people's resistance to allowing this to
<br>
happen.  Yes, social influence does contribute to reproductive
<br>
success at many levels.
<br>
<p>However, in the end, the only thing that matters (or counts)
<br>
is whose genes make it into the next generation.  The presumption
<br>
is that societies where social influence exerts positive forces
<br>
on reproductive success will strive and outnumber those that
<br>
do not have this property.  Then, what of the hypothetical
<br>
society that influences its members to &quot;rape&quot; its members in
<br>
order to make reproduction a one-sided affair?  Why would it
<br>
be hard to imagine this society thriving?  Or a society that
<br>
influences its members to be promiscuous and reproduce ad-hoc
<br>
with anyone capable and mature?  For the moment, ignore resource
<br>
limitation problems (food, space, etc.) -- perhaps someday those
<br>
will be &quot;solved&quot; sufficiently for them to no longer even be
<br>
a problem, anyhow.
<br>
<p><p>Another (somewhat unrelated) scary thought experiment:
<br>
<p>People fear cloning/GE used to produce &quot;designer humans&quot; that
<br>
are better than organic/natural humans.  Has anyone discussed
<br>
the fear of using cloning/GE as a weapon?
<br>
<p>(I'm sure there's lots of ethics discussions around weaponizing
<br>
of cloning/GE, that I haven't read yet.)
<br>
<p>Basically, imagine a wealthy hate organization that wants to
<br>
rid the world of black people.  They genetically engineer black
<br>
males with latent genes that causes infertility and homosexuality
<br>
(thanks for mentioning them, Ben).  The first generation of
<br>
engineered (and possibly more) don't exhibit these traits.
<br>
After a number of generations, all of the decendants of this
<br>
weaponized population are either infertile, or have no instinctive
<br>
desire to reproduce, or both.  Effectively, you could wipe out
<br>
a large slice of the black (and yes, of course, the other colors
<br>
that mated with the weaponized genes) population, and by the
<br>
time it was known about, it would be too late (well, without
<br>
more cloning/GE to undo the damage, of course).
<br>
<p>Similar to the conspiracy theory behind HIV/AIDS, but I think
<br>
this one is a lot scarier.  Unless, genetic testing becomes
<br>
as accessible as HIV testing ...
