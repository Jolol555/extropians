<p><em>&gt;### Just for the sake of philosophical hair-splitting - murdering
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The problem isn't your philosophical system, it's mine, and in mine
<br>
these men were/are cowards and will be treated/refered to as such.
<br>
<p>These acts took place within the borders of the continental U.S.,
<br>
and by our standards and laws they are both cowardly and criminal.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Cowardly is the one who doesn't have the strength to stand for his
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>They most certainly did slink away rather than face the
<br>
consequences, so by your own standards they are indeed cowards.
<br>
<p>Their associates will not be able to slink away.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The 9/11 fanatics and some of their still living buddies are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unfortunately, not cowards.
</em><br>
<p>A matter of your own opinion, and in violation of your own
<br>
standards as I've already pointed out.
<br>
<p>By our standards they are cowards, and I'm sure my mates will
<br>
remind them of such as they are removing them from the face of the
<br>
earth.
