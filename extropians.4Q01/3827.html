Extropes,
<br>
<p>At
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-12/ns-wme120501.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2001-12/ns-wme120501.php</a>
<br>
<p>You will find
<br>
<p>What makes Europa pink?
<br>
Does Europa's rosy glow betray a flourishing colony of
<br>
bugs?
<br>
<p>THE red tinge of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, could
<br>
be caused by frozen bits of bacteria. Their presence
<br>
would also help explain Europa's mysterious infrared
<br>
signal. Europa is mostly frozen water, but it absorbs
<br>
infrared radiation differently to how normal ice does.
<br>
Researchers think this is because something is binding
<br>
the water molecules together. Salts of magnesium
<br>
sulphate frozen within the ice, for example, would
<br>
make the molecules vibrate at different frequencies.
<br>
But no one has managed to come up with the perfect mix
<br>
of salts to explain all of Europa's spectrum. 
<br>
<p>Astrogeophysicist Brad Dalton wondered if something
<br>
else was bound up with the water molecules. &quot;Just on a
<br>
lark, I asked a colleague of mine at Yellowstone if he
<br>
had any IR spectra of extremophile bacteria,&quot; he says,
<br>
and he was shocked by how well they matched Europa's
<br>
mysterious spectrum. Then he analysed three kinds of
<br>
bacteria under the same sort of conditions as Europa:
<br>
its temperature is about -170 ¡C and at 0.01 millibars
<br>
it has virtually no atmosphere. 
<br>
<p>Preliminary results show that all three species, the
<br>
ordinary gut bacteria Escherichia coli, and
<br>
extremophiles Deinococcus radiodurans and Sulfolobus
<br>
shibatae, are just as good at explaining Europa's IR
<br>
spectrum as the salts. However Dalton says the two
<br>
species that thrive under extreme conditions are
<br>
obviously more likely candidates for life on the icy
<br>
moon. They also happen to be pink and brown, which
<br>
would help explain the red patches on the moon's face.
<br>
<p><p>Bacteria couldn't survive on Europa's surface, but
<br>
there might be liquid water inside Europa's icy crust
<br>
capable of supporting life. &quot;They could be blasted out
<br>
to the surface in some kind of eruption and flash
<br>
frozen,&quot; says Dalton. He plans to present his results
<br>
at the Lunar and Planetary Science conference next
<br>
spring. 
<br>
<p>Glenn Teeter from the Pacific Northwest National
<br>
Laboratory in Washington state says bacteria aren't
<br>
the simplest explanation for Europa's spectrum. &quot;It
<br>
does strike me as a bit far fetched,&quot; he says. But it
<br>
can't be ruled out until we go there to see. 
<br>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
