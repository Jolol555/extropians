Looks like the Euro parliament is a little bit more &quot;reasonable&quot; than the 
<br>
current conservative trend in the U.S. at the moment, but only just.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;<a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011129/hl/eu_2.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011129/hl/eu_2.html</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters Health) - After a morning of passionate debate, with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cries of ``cannibalism'' and ``sub-humans,'' the European Parliament on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thursday overwhelmingly rejected a 300-page draft report on the ethical, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;legal, economic and social implications of human genetics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Robert Goebbels, the socialist Euro-MP who chaired the special committee 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;throughout its year-long discussions, told Reuters Health after the vote 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it left Parliament looking ''ridiculous and undignified.''
</em><br>
<p>Loved this bit;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In a confused series of votes, the Parliament initially introduced several 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amendments that were mutually contradictory--seeking in some cases to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tighten controls on genetic research, and in other cases to ease them
</em><br>
<p>It looks as though most people just can't put the pieces of this debate 
<br>
together.  Maybe when they realize how &quot;contradictory&quot; their current views 
<br>
can be, they'll wise up a bit.  Or at least think some more.
<br>
<p>I think we're heading for something big here in Europe the first time a 
<br>
clone pregnancy/child is presented to the media.  People are going to wake 
<br>
up big time when it comes to figuring out that their choices will be to 
<br>
have a state ordered abortion (NOT going to go down well, not going to 
<br>
happen either), or in the case of a child, jailing the mother and all 
<br>
involved (NOT going to go down well).  Wonder how the foster parents (Coz 
<br>
Daddy, if there is one, will likely be sent down too) will answer when the 
<br>
child asks;
<br>
<p>&quot;Why is my Mommy in prison?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Because she did a bad thing.  She had you&quot;.
<br>
<p>Any volunteers?
<br>
<p><p><p>James....
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
