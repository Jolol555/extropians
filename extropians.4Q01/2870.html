We were in Arizona (just outside Phoenix) and caught the last hours 
<br>
before sunrise.  Max and I were bundled up in blankets, and our 
<br>
friends and children were snuggled up and horizontal on the trampoline. 
<br>
On a tree near by, an owl close by who was &quot;Ooohh&quot;'ing and &quot;Whooo&quot;ing along with us -:)

<p>Now, that sounds really nice!  I was watching videos with friends when the meteor shower came by.  But, only my cigarette addicted friend actually saw the meteors!  He would go upstairs/outside for a smoke break and see them.  He would yell for the rest of us to come out and take a look.  But, we could never get ouside in time!  So, I guess his smoking habit did have some advantage for him, because he saw the meteors while his nonsmoking friends did not.  
<br>
<p>I'm not saying this gives any sort of reproductive advantage, though.  He could also on a smoke break witness a mafia rubout(no witnesses allowed), or get trampled by a moose.  But, he got lucky this time.  
<br>
<p>best wishes,
