<p>The construction cost for a single self-replicating nanorobot

based on in-place manufacturing methods is essentially $0.
<br>
The design cost may or may not be significant.  It depends
<br>
on how similar the designs for space based nanorobots are
<br>
to say medical nanorobots (or how effectively the CAD tools
<br>
for nanorobot designs for medical applications lower the cost
<br>
of designing those for other applications).
<br>
<p>Space development *can* piggyback very easily on developments
<br>
for other applications.  Note that &quot;nanorobots&quot; are not strictly
<br>
necessary, MEMSbots would likely be as effective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Designers of said space paid for how?
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't matter.  You could simply have them construct a spherical
<br>
room.  If you use most of the material available is utilized to
<br>
manufacture self-replicating construction bots (e.g. utility fog)
<br>
then they can form whatever structure you want relatively rapidly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which will be years, probably at least a century or two, later for most

</em><br>
<p>You have to be assuming that nanotech development fails completely
<br>
to believe that we will not be in space in a robust way within the
<br>
next 50 years.  I myself would place bets on the expansion occuring
<br>
in the 2020-2030 time frame.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Right now? $0, or close enough to make no difference. I'm not

<em>&gt; kidding: NASA might well, say, boost its discarded shuttle fuel tanks
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That simply isn't true.  It looks to me like habitat space is worth
<br>
something in the vicinity of $10-20 million per week (once the
<br>
development costs are &quot;sunk&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Asteroid mining, *if one delivers the minerals to Earth to sell them*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is one such activity. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  To get them to Earth reliably, without vaporizing most
<br>
of your payload, you have to have controlled deceleration -- or sufficient
<br>
manufacturing capability in space that the heat shield that you vaporize
<br>
is made out of relatively worthless material.  So you have to lift into
<br>
orbit (a) fuel for deceleration; or (b) heat shield manufacturing capacity.
<br>
I've never seen anything (and I've read a fair amount of literature on
<br>
the topic) that suggests that the calculations for this have been done
<br>
and can in fact produce a net profit.
<br>
<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again.  The proper course of space
<br>
development is autonomous *small* partially self-replicating evolving
<br>
into fully self-replicating probes that are designed to land on NEOs,
<br>
and arrange for transport back into HEO (high Earth orbit) &quot;safe&quot;
<br>
packages (those that would burn up should orbital calculations or
<br>
something else go wrong) containing useful metals (e.g. Al, Si)
<br>
or fuel (H2O).  Once the raw materials are available for essentially
<br>
&quot;free&quot; one has an incentive to produce designs and develop in-space
<br>
manufacturing capacity to produce habitats for tourists, interplanetary
<br>
transport ships, etc.
