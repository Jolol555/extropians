</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks, Anders. If anyone has any ideas, please post them up. I think we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should put this all together as a sort of FAQ or 'talking points' memo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for clone proponents to study at length, especially before giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interviews or taking part in debates.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks, and a good idea! I think there are several pages out there with
<br>
arguments for cloning that could be incorporated into such a FAQ. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 1) Threats against human dignity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;         - By interfering in the reproductive process humans become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manufactured rather than just born, and this makes the child subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its parents or whoever is doing the cloning rather than a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; independent human being. This weakens human dignity, as virtues and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flaws become merely features and misfeatures of the &quot;manufacturing&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might carry over in other spheres of human culture as a genetization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet the manufacturing of human embryos already occurs in in vitro
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fertility clinics around the world. What difference is there if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embryo has one or two genetic parents? Do you propose that all in vitro
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medicine be outlawed?
</em><br>
<p>I think many anti-cloning proponents actually fall into the camp that
<br>
dislikes IVF, but since it is widely accepted they concentrate on the
<br>
area where they are most likely to make &quot;good&quot; by causing a cloning ban.
<br>
IVF comes later, just look at Leon Kass. 
<br>
<p>Others likely point out that there is a profound difference between
<br>
having one and two parents, suggesting that this causes the resulting
<br>
human to be different from all other humans. This invokes both worries
<br>
about the natural order and how the clone will fare. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;         - The Kantian ethical idea that humans must be ends in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves, and not tools for other ends is sometimes invoked by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggesting that clones are created for other reasons than simply being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Show me any parent who claims that the don't have their children either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) accidentally or b) for entirely selfish purposes of self fulfillment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No parent has kids specifically to produce independent beings. Each has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopes and intentions of producing the sort of kids THEY think should be,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and many highly resent letting go of their dominion over their kids.
</em><br>
<p>On the other hand they also (with some exceptions) accept that kids will
<br>
become independent beings. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2) Threats against the natural order.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;         - There is something inherently sacred or otherwise valuable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natural reproduction, and this is damaged by cloning. The damage may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be directed at the people involved, but could affect others who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffer from living in a world where aspects of the natural order have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been disrupted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If 'sacred' is referring to religion, every religion has myths about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virgin births, and celebrates them as wonderful occurences. Any 'virgin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; birth' that would occur would most certainly be a clone of the mother,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore, cloning is to be celebrated as a wonderful sacrement.
</em><br>
<p>With the exception of Rael, cloning done by humans is simply infringing
<br>
on God's domain, i.e. something BAD. Most religions doesn't have the
<br>
idea that humans can be the cause of the sacred - humans can be channels
<br>
for the sacred to enter the world, but humans cannot create the sacred.
<br>
Hence they would not agree with your idea of cloning as a sacrament. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4) Practical threats to the child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;         - Cloning is likely to produce miscarriages and deformities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and in humans certain changes might not become apparent until puberty or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; later, when the clone is already an individual and will suffer from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conventional conception already produces miscarriages and deformities to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an alarmingly high degree. A significant percent of the population is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unable to conceive children due to incompatibilities, or refrains from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing so due to fears of passing on known genetic defects from one or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other parent. If reproduction is truly a right of all people, as so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many claim, then technology should be used to allow those who cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally conceive to have children. To instead claim that some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should not reproduce due to natural limitations is a very Arcadian sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of romantic genetic elitism, and a denial of the primary characteristic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mankind: the ability to overcome natural hurdles with their minds. On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this basis, any ban on cloning for reproductive purposes is inhumane.
</em><br>
<p>Good points (including those I have snipped). We should remember that we
<br>
are doing &quot;unnatural&quot; things for humane reasons, and that being
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; often means being both elitist and cruel. I prefer to live in
<br>
a world ruled by rationality and humanism, with all their flaws, than a
<br>
world ruled by &quot;natural law&quot;. The later doesn't care about humans. 
<br>
<p>That said, there is a common view that people will do cloning &quot;because
<br>
it can be done&quot; rather than for some good reason (like helping childless
<br>
people), and it is less clear cloning should be done for such a reason.
<br>
But much of this is a misunderstanding of what research is actually
<br>
being done and what motivates it. Unfortunately information is not
<br>
enough, we have to show really what motivates biomedical researchers and
<br>
the place of science and humanity in the big picture before people can
<br>
really trust these developments. Hard but necessary work.
