For some time I've been interested in what I call the &quot;Unreality Imperative,&quot;
<br>
which I describe as the strong urge to distort or deny aspects of reality --
<br>
creating and/or accepting &quot;unreal beliefs&quot; -- because confronting them
<br>
and seeing certain aspects of reality for what they are is considered
<br>
too &quot;uncomfortable,&quot; &quot;threatening,&quot; or &quot;painful.&quot;

and 'The Corruption of Reality'

by John Shumaker are two important and relevant books.
<br>
<p>Schumaker uses the term &quot;paranormal belief imperative&quot; to include religious/
<br>
paranormal belief. I use the wider ranging &quot;unreality imperative&quot; and argue
<br>
that some areas not covered by Schumaker also belong in the unreality
<br>
domain.
<br>
<p>Schumaker's basic thesis is that certain aspects of reality are unpalatable
<br>
to human consciousness/intelligence. To cope with this, we developed a
<br>
&quot;counter-intelligence&quot; that enables us to escape harsh reality with unreal
<br>
beliefs such as religion, the paranormal, etc. (It also seems to me that
<br>
much of political language and belief belongs to the &quot;counter-intelligent&quot;
<br>
unreality domain.)
<br>
<p>Much of &quot;culture&quot; is a result of the unreality imperative. Many humans are
<br>
to some extent slaves of their culture. Schumaker calls culture, &quot;the master
<br>
hypnotist.&quot;
<br>
<p>Schumaker claims that human nature is paradoxical in that we are
<br>
creatures of opposites. The same person can behave in a highly
<br>
intelligent manner on some occasions, while behaving stupidly on
<br>
other occasions. In 'The Corruption of Reality,' Schumaker backs
<br>
up the possibility of such opposite behavior by citing relevant brain
<br>
research. He claims we have both intelligence and &quot;counter-intelligence&quot;
<br>
(stupidity circuits?).
<br>
<p>This could account for the phenomenon of someone manifesting great
<br>
intelligence in some areas of life, while appearing not quite so intelligent
<br>
in other areas.
<br>
<p>So far, I've paid very little attention to DENIAL, specifically identifying
<br>
the different mechanisms of denial people typically use to &quot;escape&quot;
<br>
from reality. Obviously, denial is a central aspect of the unreality
<br>
imperative.
<br>
<p>A trenchant example of denial is the victim of a serial wife-beater
<br>
who believes some &quot;miracle&quot; will change him. So she stays with
<br>
him suffering repeated beatings year after year, until eventually
<br>
he kills her. Deadly denial of reality!
<br>
<p>Some consider the major function of those who call themselves
<br>
&quot;government&quot; to be the provision of defense. On September 11th,
<br>
a massive failure in the provision of defense occurred. Nevertheless,
<br>
afterward, &quot;faith in government&quot; soared. This seems to me to involve
<br>
denial of reality.
<br>
<p>I love the &quot;I AM A MURDERER&quot; &lt;<a href="http://209.41.174.82/murder.html">http://209.41.174.82/murder.html</a>&gt;
<br>
page because it so starkly focuses on the issue of denial. (My
<br>
suggested solution to the &quot;abortion dilemma&quot; is to develop the
<br>
technology to remove a fetus from a mother's womb and have it
<br>
survive and grow in another woman's womb or in a &quot;mechanical
<br>
womb.&quot; But this isn't really relevant to my current enquiry.)
<br>
<p>Does anyone know of a comprehensive classification/taxonomy
<br>
of different forms and mechanisms of denial?

<br>
himself into in the first place.&quot; -- Jonathan Swift
