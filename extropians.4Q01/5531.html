<em>&gt; Laws, as they stand right now, don't work as they are intended to.
</em><br>
<p>I think that depends on who's doing the intending, doesn't it?
<br>
The people who own the law (or think they do) will try to make it do what they
<br>
want.
<br>
Ever has it been so... and likewise, the people who own the singularity (or
<br>
think they do) will try to make it do what they want... and if they can't make
<br>
it do what they want, then they will try to make it illegal.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
