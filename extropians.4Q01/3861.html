You saw they said it uses 5c electricity/day? Batteries should be OK.

Subject: Re: Could this be IT?
<br>
<p>What struck me as most interesting about this invention, is the concepts
<br>
of 
<br>
its gyro-stability and the forward-backward, thought-controlled McGuffin
<br>
that 
<br>
it uses. My concern is that it is not (as was reported) utilizing some
<br>
kind 
<br>
of sterling engine, but is battery powered. So like all Christmas toys,
<br>
when 
<br>
the batteries (not included) fail, the fun stops. 12 miles per hour is a
<br>
<p>little slack, but its the Range that needs to be looked at. Looked at,
<br>
as in 
<br>
why not fuel cells, or flywheels. Is the market for this busy college
<br>
kids 
<br>
crunching across campus for classes, or Manhattanites?
