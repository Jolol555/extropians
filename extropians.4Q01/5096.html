<em>&gt; Getting along, as always needs to be noted, is a two-way street. It meets at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the corner of mutuality and reciprocation. If the future is like Mr. Crocker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has stated, the X-Men Effect ( a much watered-down version of the Marvel
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed the cardinal sin of cohabiting his God-given flesh with satanic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inhuman robot-stuff?
</em><br>
<p>Why yes, as many times as ve wishes!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My guess is Preacher, Bob Jones, will sayeth neigh! Brothers and Sisters. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mr. Crocker's view's need to be heeded on this point. This has been discussed
</em><br>

<p>Brother Jones is a bit horsey but &quot;neigh&quot;?  :-)

<em>&gt; Lee Daniel Crocker aptly, commented:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Our present irrational concerns about race will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiped out not because we will come together, but because we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diverge and speciate and migrate to the point where what are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceived as &quot;racial&quot; differences will be of less magnitude than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual differences we will be able to create.  As we grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apart, it will be all the more important that we learn how to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of diversity and comparative advantage so that the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; races we become will continue to work effectively toward even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater diversity and creativity as we expand into the universe.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If we do not also find some unity of fundamental agreements
<br>
within our diversity then we are likely to have quite a bit of
<br>
transhuman war.  I certainly agree with the goodness of
<br>
diversity but it is not a substitute for also expanding our
<br>
ethics and realm of concern to include everyone.
