<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't see any similarity between the activities of an organisation

<em>&gt; that

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; seeks to defend civil liberties in the US and a terrorist organisation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for thousands of murders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The ACLU seeks to advance its socialist agenda while pretending to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civil liberties ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socialist agenda?  Pretending to defend civil liberties?  Do you have proof
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to back up such statements?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From what I've observed, the ACLU has historically protected individuals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups it has found odious (Nazi sympathizers, for instance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you, J.R., if you were running things - extend civil liberties to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;socialists&quot; whom you find despicable?
</em><br>
<p>The ACLU demonstrates its bias by what cases they choose to defend, as
<br>
well as those they choose NOT to defend. They refuse, for instance, to
<br>
be involved in the defense of Dr. Timothy Emerson, a formerly law
<br>
abiding, productive member of the community. They instead submitted
<br>
amicus curae briefs to both the District and Appeals courts AGAINST
<br>
Emerson. They wish to help ensure that the discredited 'community
<br>
rights' interpretation remains that used by government. Socialism needs
<br>
to disarm the population to succeed.
<br>
<p>They choose to defend the most eggregious, most offensive, most
<br>
ludicrous cases of free speech: Nazis, Klansmen, Skinheads, while not
<br>
lifting a finger to defend moderately conservative or libertarian
<br>
students at liberal arts colleges and universities against the left-wing
<br>
political witchhunts and everyday bigotry that pervade campus life
<br>
today. The purpose of this bias is to help sow disrespect for civil
<br>
rights in the general population. If the average law abiding citizen
<br>
sees civil rights as only protecting what they view as 'freaks', or
<br>
fringe members of society, and not themselves, then they are far more
<br>
predisposed to support the establishment of the sort of police state
<br>
repressions needed to launch a socialist revolution.
