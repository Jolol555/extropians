<em>&gt; Ah, but could an AA not then become mature, though deliberately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tricking the system (say, by simply declining to declare MM status),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then exploit the MMs' prohibitions while using a pseudonym or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to get around the limits on discussion?  Even if some acts were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traced to the AA, the MMs could not do anything that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly limit the AA's future.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you mention a certain flaw that we do see in our societies.
<br>
<p><p>In the past, some &quot;infants&quot; (Latin can get quite offensive sometimes) did manage to trick some companies to give them loans or other
<br>
stuff without payment. The law did catch up a little, but not enough. Of the few case laws I know of, one concerns a tailor whom
<br>
could not claim money for some clothing he supplied to a rich &quot;infant&quot; because the Court deemed these as not neccessaries (since the
<br>
&quot;infant&quot; already had about 20 pieces of similiar clothing) and thus not subject to payment.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, the companies did wise up quickly, refusing to do business with such people unless they have some guarantor above the Age
<br>
of Majority whom they can bind the contract with, remaining as the status quo today. Meanwhile, I did hear of cases in the US where
<br>
some kids vandalise property and the Police could not do anything about them because they considered the children too immature.
<br>
<p><p>In the case of the proposed colony, I intend the rules I propose more as guidelines than as absolutely binding, so the AAs can still
<br>
receive punishment if they go against the system in bad faith. As for punishment, I had not figured what would work, but I suspect
<br>
it would have a more intellectual than physical nature. [Note: I don't *make* the punishment. I can only propose it and let the
<br>
Intellicracy figure this out.]
<br>
<p><p>The possibility of AAs taking advantage of MMs does seem possible, however, the colony would most likely provide little incentive
<br>
(as a well designed system should) to troublemakers. For one thing, it can trace all messages internally (but of course, everyone
<br>
can look at the traces too). I had not even mention that discussion systems of the future may hardly resemble the primitive systems
<br>
we use today.
<br>
<p>I must also make clear that the goal of this restriction does not simply have the purpose of preventing the AA from learning about
<br>
taboos, but even more that the AA does not spam or otherwise abuse the system by wrong usage, and also that the AA actually
<br>
contribute something useful to the system instead of nonsense. I suspect that the colony will have few, if any, taboos, and probably
<br>
its inhabitants need not wear clothes if they so disire.
<br>
<p><p>For another, its education will also focus on psychology, sociology and general self-understanding, important topics that our
<br>
societies ignore at its own peril. [Side note: The educational system will provide only the most elementary skills neccessary for
<br>
independent learning. The people learn any advanced course by themselves (and they can teach each other if they want).]
<br>
<p>If some &quot;smart-ass&quot; AAs want to do &quot;adult&quot; things, then they should apply for the MM trial peroid. If they just want to make
<br>
&quot;harmless&quot; trouble, perhaps a VR simulation system and some fellow players might allow them. Concerning MM exploitation of material
<br>
items, they can't do too much partially because the economical system does not have such strict lines drawn for individual property
<br>
so they can't &quot;own&quot; things (or at least in the understanding of the cocnept we have today).
<br>
<p><p>Please also note that I had not fully expanded on the idea yet, only providing a rough guide to the final form of the system. The
<br>
actual implementaion ought to handle such situations much better.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Basic problem: legal categorization of people is imperfect.  If it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits people to exploit the difference between the law's intent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its reality, people will do so.  (Ideal systems can be imagined, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historically, any attempt to implement always introduces bugs.  Merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying &quot;this one will be perfect&quot; has, when tried, only resulted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less attention being paid to actually fixing the bugs.)
</em><br>
<p>This shows the flaw with using absolute and as many rules as we can to fix the problem (a la program-o-topia), as Godel's Theorem
<br>
and its good friend Murphy's Law will manifest themselves. A good legal system ought to focus more on goals, guidelines and
<br>
heuristics instead of rules and more rules. Unfortunately, I have yet to compute sufficient details.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is a problem with the accreditation, too, since &quot;accredited&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;not accredited&quot; are but legal categories in this case.  However, here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the abuse is more likely to be by those who do the acceditation, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are few benefits to not being accredited, but many perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and, IMO, mostly false) ones to making sure that people you do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally know and trust can not exploit a field of knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>I don't like the concept of accreditation, having experienced and seen some of its abuses.
<br>
<p>For instance, education here in Singapore (and I heard, in many other countries) sucks. I dare not hire people only using
<br>
educational qualifications, but would hire regardless of qualifications and test their true skills instead, because I had
<br>
*personally seen* the quality and expertise of those people to know better.
<br>
<p><p>I had not mentioned that modes of unreliability commonly used not just have great unreliability and variation, but one can actually
<br>
subject them to abuse in various circumstances. Common and known tactics such as &quot;spotting&quot; questions, completing many similar
<br>
questions (and thus learning the test very well, defeating its objectiveness) and even cheating.
<br>
<p>Such assessments also grew to the status of the ends of education instead of merely a convenience for HR personnel, with students
<br>
actually refusing to study anything &quot;outside the syllabus&quot; and concentrating on memorizing the textbook so that they can pass the
<br>
assessments that come their way. This comes with grave consequences for one's society, where people focus on learning for
<br>
accreditation instead of learning for the joy of learning. They learnt to rely on others for learning direction instead of
<br>
themselves, often resulting in an explosion of thousand-dollar courses that teach nothing much but merely provide them with a
<br>
certificate to get them the job they want.
<br>
<p><p>In such a case of passive learning, at worst these people believe absolutely in what the textbook says, subjecting them to
<br>
Government propaganda and also as willing sheep for the commercial course providers to fleece. At best, they do not learn the
<br>
essential skills to think and learn so that they can make new discoveries and contribute to their societies' progress. It turns out
<br>
that only a small elite manage to escape this trap, and they, not the passive learners, control the future.
<br>
<p>As we approach the Singularity, these people won't make the mark. They see the increasing complexity and changes of our societies as
<br>
obstacles to their stable lives than as opportunities for learning and exploration. Like the Luddites in the past, they will soon
<br>
find their skills and abilities obsolete by the computers, and perhaps not too long later, they might start a neo-Luddite movement
<br>
to fight back the computers instead of changing their mindsets, with grave consequences.
<br>
<p><p>One might hope that accreditation might work, but in most cases, some parties will eventually take control of the accreditation
<br>
process and take advantage of it. Some professionals use this to limit the membership to their profession so that they have a form
<br>
of oligopoly over their clients and could charge high rates. Governments could also use such tactics to ensure that their citizens
<br>
get an adequate dose of propaganda.
<br>
<p>Even in an ideal Rational Society without the possibility of abuse, the unreliability of accreditation would make one think twice
<br>
before implementing it. At best, such accreditation would have only a superfluous nature, and at worse, it would prevent individuals
<br>
from contributing to the society in the best way possible while placing less incompetent people to take the controls.
<br>
<p><p>The best form of accrediation, I believe, would result from the actual (and perhaps potential) skills and achievements of an
<br>
individual applied to the actual problem you wish to solve. All else, like attempts to detect the ether, would only fall flat on
<br>
their attempts.
<br>
<p>Refer to the following for some details of what I feel dissatisfied about:
