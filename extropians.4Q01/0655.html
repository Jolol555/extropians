<em>&gt;A lot of the apps I've seen suggested by communicating through

<em>&gt;All this does is make the communication instantaneous, but speed of

</em><br>
<p><p>Heck, I'd settle for speed of sound if I could directly transfer 
<br>
thoughts/images/concepts to another mind. I suspect the problem is going to 
<br>
be interfacing at each end rather than the transmitting between.
<br>
<p>The way I see it eventually happening is that we will each wear our own 
<br>
computer which constantly watches the electrical actions in our brains in 
<br>
microscopic detail. These computers will be AIs in their own right and will 
<br>
gradually come to learn what parts of our brains correspond to what 
<br>
thoughts/emotions/perceptions/movements. They will quite literally read our 
<br>
minds. Unlike our wetware they will be able to transmit the mental info to 
<br>
other people's computers which will be able to map the data to their host 
<br>
brain's topology and stimulate them directly in the corresponding regions.
<br>
<p>Even with this degree of communication things are not so cut and dried 
<br>
though.  How does one computer communicate color info to someone who is 
<br>
color blind? I am sure there would be some data that would not be able to 
<br>
be transferred properly because some people might have sufficiently 
<br>
dissimilar backgrounds that nothing quite matches up, however there may be 
<br>
some way of extrapolating such difficult experiences back to basic sensory 
<br>
data. For instance if someone wants to communicate their love of custard 
<br>
apples they could send the flavor of custard apple as basic taste data, 
<br>
then adding emotional overtones in -- where they were the first time they 
<br>
tasted it, how happy they were, and a lot of other subconscious emotional 
<br>
baggage that goes with the experience.
<br>
<p>I think the most useful aspect would be teaching of concepts. These are 
<br>
often the most tricky to get across to others via language. However with 
<br>
that comes the risk that it also becomes wonderful indoctrination 
<br>
machinery. It would be very easy to impart pathological fears or hatred, 
<br>
though presumably the AIs would have safeguards... people will not likely 
<br>
be too happy about exposing their most valuable organ to that kind of risk.
<br>
<p>Much could be communicated because a lot of experiences are shared by us 
<br>
all, but it wouldn't be the solution to all communications.
<br>
<p>I think it's a long way away... 50 years????
<br>
