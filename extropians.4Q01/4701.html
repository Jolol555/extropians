Subject: Forgotten memory

<p>&nbsp;&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>living at all.  With his memories constantly being erased, is there any
<br>
point to staying alive? 
<br>
<p>### None
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Dying would erase his memories and his future.
<br>
But his memories are already gone, and in a way the point of a future
<br>
is to give you new memories.  If those are going to be taken from you
<br>
as well, then what is the point of living?
<br>
<p>### It's useless, or at least this is the perception that I would have if I
<br>
knew I were in the same situation. I would put all my resources into either
<br>
getting my memory fixed (hippocampal stem cell injections?) or else I would
<br>
get myself frozen.
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p>The second point is that if we manage to survive for a very long time,
<br>
our situation may be much like Leonard's.  If we reject the notion of
<br>
stasis, for what is the point of living forever if you are in a rut,
<br>
then we have to embrace change.  And with enough change, inevitably
<br>
the person you were before will be lost.  While the memories may not
<br>
be totally erased, still you will be effectively a different person and
<br>
the memories might as well belong to someone else.  Of course the time
<br>
horizon will be much larger; unlike Leonard's 15 minutes, we may have
<br>
a thousand subjective years of continuity.  But beyond that threshold,
<br>
we will not be the same person.  Like Leonard, our life will be a series
<br>
of time-bounded moments, with continuity and causality linking them,
<br>
but no sense of common identity.
<br>
<p>Some have argued that such a picture is appealing because even though
<br>
they will change so much as to be unrecognizable, the changes will be
<br>
gradual so they will still be, in a sense, the same person.
<br>
<p>### All of us have death detection routines in our minds. They are very
<br>
closely related to the self-concept or personal identity concept which is so
<br>
frequently discussed here. The particular implementation of death detection
<br>
that runs in my mind does not trip an alarm when confronted with the idea of
<br>
fully voluntary psychological transformation leading to being changed beyond
<br>
recognition. Again, a matter of taste.
<br>
<p><p>BTW, talking about movies - &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; is about 3 times better than &quot;AI&quot;.
<br>
It's coherent, expresses views with which I agree, and it's only drawback is
<br>
the rather slow development of the plot. It's sad that it seems to be very
<br>
much misunderstood and disliked by critics and the general public, despite
<br>
initial good box office returns.
