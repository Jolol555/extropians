This is right. Certainly, breaking up big states into little ones is
<br>
progress of a sort because small states can simply do less mischief than big
<br>
ones. (Also public choice problems are less severe in a smaller polity). The
<br>
problem is that most people who want to secede from a modern state simply
<br>
want to set up a slightly smaller modern state. Quite apart from the
<br>
problems this causes with minorities who don't want to secede or want to
<br>
themselves secede from the new entity (many, many examples come to mind)
<br>
what is not being addressed is the fundamental problem - the nature of the
<br>
modern state. The key problem for me is the concept of &quot;sovereignty&quot;, the
<br>
idea that there can be only one ultimate undivided source of authority in a
<br>
state. When this is combined with nationalism which merges alliegance and
<br>
identity the results are disastrous. We need to find a way of severing the
<br>
links between territory, sovereignty and identity. On Scotland, the Scots
<br>
have been given what Billy Connolly aptly calls a &quot;pretendy Parliament&quot;,
<br>
which has had the effect of handing over the Scots to the mercies of the
<br>
Scottish Labour Party - God help them! Steve Davies.
