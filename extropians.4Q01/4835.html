<em>&gt; &gt; Now, who exactly is &quot;they&quot;? Don't we first have to find out, before we

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless you've been in a coma for the last three months, I should think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be obvious that &quot;they&quot; are the terrorist groups (bin Laden, et al.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who contrived the September 11, 2001 attack.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I'm sorry. It's so easy then. Just raid the offices of Al'Qaeda in the 
<br>
US and get their member lists...
<br>
<p>I repeat: Who _exactly_ are &quot;they&quot;? What are the criteria? Which of the 276 
<br>
mio. persons in the US are &quot;members of their group&quot;? What about the 
<br>
&quot;presumption of innocence&quot;? (I hope this is the right term)
<br>
<p>You may want to read some articles about how these people of 9-11 lived the 
<br>
last years. And you may come to the conclusion that you wouldn't get every 
<br>
one of them if you'd imprison every person with muslim background. Again: 
<br>
even if you would detain every person with a muslim background, you still 
<br>
wouldn't be safe.
<br>
<p>The pilots and helpers of the 9-11 incident have lived and studied legally 
<br>
in Germany for years. One of them was even born in Germany. They didn't 
<br>
raise any suspicion. They had no problems with the authorities. They came 
<br>
legally into the USA (although they must have lied when filling in the 
<br>
immigration form - &quot;are you a member of a terrorist group&quot;...) and even got 
<br>
their pilot licenses legally.
<br>
<p>What kind of &quot;police work&quot; could find them without making the whole country 
<br>
a police state?
