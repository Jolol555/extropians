<em>&gt; I don't think it's the appropriate time for it. This is supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be about terrorism. We are after the people who murdered our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens. The focus should be on that and that alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The average person on the streets in the middle east has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watching the agitprop coming from Al-Jazeera, they think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Israelis destroyed the World Trade Center!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What is &quot;supposed to be about terrorism&quot;?  If we are attempting
<br>
to find solutions to terrorism then it is important to
<br>
understand where it comes from and why.  If part of the why is
<br>
the grievances various countries and entities have against US
<br>
policies then the question comes up as to whether any of those
<br>
grievances have merit and whether we are in fact sometimes
<br>
acting in oppressive manner in other countries and what we might
<br>
do to change that if so.  
<br>
<p>If it makes sense to agree to an open-ended &quot;war&quot; to root out
<br>
all actual terrorists from anywhere and everywhere then surely
<br>
it also makes sense to understand the roots and to work to
<br>
lessen the seeds of future terrorism where/if we can.  
<br>
<p>I don't see how the &quot;that alone&quot; makes any sense at all. 
<br>
Especially when our government is certainly not after &quot;that
<br>
alone&quot; but after finding and neutralizing all terrorists
<br>
everywhere.  
<br>
<p>Al-Jareeza happens to be the most independent and competent news
<br>
source in the Mid East.  That some of its writers may have
<br>
expoused an alternate theory does not mean they are incompetent
<br>
nicompoops.  Especially when the biases in other reports from
<br>
more &quot;mainstream&quot; sources have also been quite evident.  
<br>
<p>In point of fact, we do not know who was behind the attack yet. 
<br>
We have strong suspicion of it being bin Laden.  But I haven't
<br>
seen anything really strong enough to convict in an open court
<br>
yet.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I think we're on the wrong track. I think we're screwing around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;and we need to get serious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What does serious look like if you think what is currently being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;done is not serious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even the Pentagon is admitting they have made at least two key
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistakes so far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Serious to me? I would have put ground troops in with the northern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alliance and immediately moved to re-take Kabul, and Maziri-al-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sherif with all the air support required. Once an airbase had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; established I would have poured ground troops in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To what end?  What are your objectives?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Once Kabul was re-taken and the Taliban rounded up, I would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put in a call for U.N. peacekeepers to hold it and started flying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in humanitarian supplies. This would leave troops free to move on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and crush Kandahar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why is crushing Kandahar a big objective?  I agree on bringing
<br>
in UN peacekeepers and bringing in aid before winter comes on
<br>
100%.
