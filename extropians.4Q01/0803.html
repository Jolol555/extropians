</em><br>
<p>Which government is easiest to overthrow, the US or the Afghan? The
<br>
Swedish or the Zimbabwian? Open democratic societies are extremely
<br>
resilient, and tend to withstand even severe crises which in less open
<br>
societies would lead to chaos. As Edward Luttwak described in _Coup
<br>
D'Etat_, performing a coup is only practically possible in countries
<br>
with a sufficiently centralised government, which also is isolated
<br>
towards the population. In an open society there are many self-repairing
<br>
and self-maintaining processes, which means that an attack to disrupt
<br>
the society will have to handle all these processes. In closed
<br>
societies, such self-repair processes are usually highly regulated and
<br>
run by professional agencies which do not base their action on public
<br>
support. Hence the closed societies become brittle.
<br>
<p>(societies that are a total mess are of course also very stable, things
<br>
can't get much worse)
<br>
<p>Hence information about overthrowing governments is not that dangerous
<br>
in open societies, while very subversive in closed. It might be
<br>
interesting to look at which nations have banned Luttwak's book, for
<br>
example. If I found out a bug in the US constitution that enabled
<br>
dictatorship or some deadlock, I would likely publish it, because I know
<br>
a lot of people would immediately start trying to find ways of patching
<br>
it. This is equivalent to what happens in open source: open societies
<br>
get constructive criticism on all levels, and even if they don't
<br>
immediately fix all the problems (sometimes it takes a lot of time and
<br>
effort to overcome inertia) problems get fixed. In closed societies you
<br>
get punished for pointing out problems, and they will hence never be
<br>
fixed. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I, personally, would prefer a society with an open information flow than a censored one. However, until we can find out how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve such troublesome issues, we might still need some censorship or having to refrain from construction of a large scale colony.
</em><br>
<p>Do that. Meanwhile I will run mine with free information. We'll see
<br>
which one attracts the best people, the most investors and develops
<br>
the best relationship with the world. Historical evidence seem to
<br>
favor mine, despite your issues. 
<br>
<p>Somehow free riders, closed societies not reciprocating and all the
<br>
other problems did not stop the US from becoming world leader in
<br>
nearly everything, while all the societies that systematically try
<br>
to censor information have not done as well. In fact, I think that
<br>
if you made a plot of GNP versus openness (there simply has to be
<br>
such a plot somewhere), you would see that in general more open
<br>
societies earn far more (with some special case exceptions like
<br>
microstates like the Vatican and oil countries where income is 
<br>
based on raw materials).
