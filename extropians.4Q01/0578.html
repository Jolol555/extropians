<em>&gt; Its a swamp from an extropic point of view.  If you don't allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patents, getting investors to fund research at companies like Myriad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is much more difficult.  If you do allow patents, then you end up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher medical care costs.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't seem that hard to me.  It sounds like Myriad is trying to stop 
<br>
people from using devices that were independantly invented.  That would 
<br>
mean that the patents weren't needed to make the research happen.  It's a 
<br>
race to commercialize the technology rather than a race to the patent 
<br>
office before you know what the ideas are good for.  (Of course, you might 
<br>
argue that both research groups were banking on being the patent-holder in 
<br>
order to be able to reap the monopoly profit.  If that were the case it's 
<br>
hard to see why the loser of the patent race would continue to pursue a 
<br>
product.)
<br>
<p>If, on the other hand, the devices are derived from Myriad's work, then 
<br>
Myriad is making one of the possible choices about how much to charge for 
<br>
the technology on which they've been granted a monopoly.  They're in the 
<br>
position of having to decide how much to sqeeze for access to their patent. 
<br>
&nbsp;They can charge a lot and drive people toward other solutions, or charge 
<br>
less and hope to make it up on volume.  Neither of these choices should 
<br>
scare people away from further research.
