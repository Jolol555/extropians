<br>
atomic bomb against Russia):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At least with the benefit of hindsight I'd say that our killing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requisite tens of millions of Russian soldiers and civilians would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been an inescusable atrocity.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm... It is probably impossible to speculate here (without
<br>
a JBrain to run a simulation).  However, an atomic bomb strike
<br>
against central Moscow might have eliminated Stalin and much
<br>
of the KGB apparatus.  That would not have saved the millions
<br>
that had been previously killed (at the hands of Stalin or Hitler).
<br>
Whether the post-WWII actions of various communist regimes
<br>
is responsible for &quot;millions&quot; of deaths, I am unsure.  For example,
<br>
total U.S. deaths during the Korean war were only ~28,000 so
<br>
I think you would have to stretch things pretty far to get
<br>
into the millions.  As Moscow itself is a fairly spread
<br>
out city (nothing like the density of NYC), the civilian
<br>
casualties might have been greater tha Hiroshima or Nagisaki
<br>
but probably not &quot;significantly&quot; greater.
<br>
<p>Given the political instability that could have resulted
<br>
from such actions (the Soviet Union would then have had
<br>
a *real* reason to use atomic weapons), I doubt it can
<br>
be reasonably justified.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hitler killed tens of millions of Russians and captured/destroyed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of its prewar industry and army and that *still* wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, the point of this is very clear.  Stalin played the delay
<br>
game long enough to get his industry relocated to the Urals
<br>
where Hitler's bombers couldn't reach it.  Both Napoleon and
<br>
Hitler stumbled on the sheer size of Russian and its massive
<br>
population and resource reserves.
<br>
<p>We should heed those lessons -- a pan-Arabic state stretching from
<br>
Algeria to Pakistan with 500+ million people, united under
<br>
a single leader (Hitler/Stalin prototype) and/or an interpreted
<br>
(irrational) religious unifying force, with atomic weapons
<br>
*is* something to be seriously concerned about.
<br>
