<p>What you want is to be able to reversably program the immune
<br>
system to produce antibodies to the key surface proteins that
<br>
allow sperm to bind to eggs.  If you can disrupt binding you
<br>
should be able to prevent fertilization.  Interfering at that
<br>
point would be least disruptive of hormone functions I suspect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Reversal technology is improving rapidly, and should be more than

</em><br>
<p>Obviously nanobots programmed to block the tubes would be highly
<br>
desirable (or you could have the nanobots physically digest the
<br>
eggs or sperm).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Caveat: I don't know how early sterilization could be done

</em><br>
<p>Probably not much, but I suspect some research into genes that
<br>
result in defective sexual maturation would yield some insights.
<br>
Interestingly enough, delaying sexual maturation may have some
<br>
interesting anti-aging effects as it seems that many of the
<br>
&quot;aging&quot; related &quot;pathologies&quot; begin with sexual maturity.
<br>
<p>This makes evolutionary sense as one switches resources
<br>
from growing to reproductive size to actually reproducing.
