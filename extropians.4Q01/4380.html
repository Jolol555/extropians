From: &quot;Spike Jones&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:spike66@attglobal.net?Subject=Re:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;01e601c18579$34d07be0$665d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">spike66@attglobal.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; My notion is that we have insufficient technology to do much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else besides what is currently being done.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree, and I'd add that doing much else would not get sufficient
<br>
support from tax payers and voters, so policy is set by consensus as much as
<br>
by technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a vision of what future weapons will be like.  These might not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even be recognizable as weapons, at least not in the sense that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know weapons today.  They would not hurl chunks of metal the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way our current primitive weapons do.  Extrapolate the trends from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last half century in technology.  Imagine advanced weapons that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not destroy property, nor even lives.  Sufficiently advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weaponry would not even cause physical injury.  They would,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however destroy certain memes.  Sufficiently advanced weaponry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would destroy the memes that motivate the Taliban to do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inhuman acts they carried out on such a massive scale.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that such weapons would *ever* get public approval. How could they?
<br>
The general public already believes that everyone else is brainwashed by
<br>
government conspiracies and indoctrination. People fear the loss of their
<br>
precious belief systems more than they fear death... else how to explain the
<br>
suicide bombers/terrorists. If 9-11 proves nothing else, it proves that people
<br>
would rather die than give up their religiosity and superstitious memes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately we currently do not have sufficiently advanced weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let us develop them.
</em><br>
<p>Forget weapons. Instead, let us deprogram people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the government has nothing to say to business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how they sell their products.
</em><br>
<p>That'll be the day! Government regulates rather strictly how products are
<br>
sold, IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is anarcho-capitalism at work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crass as it is, I would have it no other way, for I know of no other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way that would work as well, nor any other way which would work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the sacred first amendment of the US constitution.  Do you?
</em><br>
<p>Capitalism is nature's way of creating economic extropy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bin Laden has quoted a verse in the Koran which says &quot;...Fight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them [the infidels] until they confess that there is no God but Allah...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Look at the incredible insanity of people who are willing to sacrifice their
<br>
lives for meaningless drivel! Are we to complain about &quot;commercialism&quot; in the
<br>
face of such an immense tragedy as millions of people taking this religious
<br>
garbage seriously? Time to remind ourselves again:
<br>
We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity... once and for
<br>
all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Taliban seem to have a special hatred for the US, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they also consider all of Europe as the home of infidels.  Guided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the words of Mohammed, they would fight there as well, until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every European confesses that there is no god but allah.  Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be ruled by the koran.  Asia cannot be ruled by a koran-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspired tyrant.
</em><br>
<p>Well said. The time for grief has passed, and the death of tyranny is
<br>
necessary to prevent further grief. If commercialism can defeat religious
<br>
tyranny, then let's celebrate commercialism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given that we have no advanced meme-destroying weaponry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are stuck with the ancient technique of destroying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meme carrier.  The evidence is sufficient: OBL and his minions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate us, they want us dead.  We want us alive.  I am open to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestion here.
</em><br>
<p>Excellent analysis, Spike. Let me point out, however, that people in general,
<br>
and even some on this email list, fear incorrect meme identification as much
<br>
as they fear meme-destroying weaponry. A machine that can accurately identify
<br>
incorrect thinking is the most frightening project in all of technology and
<br>
science, because such a machine threatens our cherished beliefs, and seems to
<br>
foretell of the displacement of human thought by something better and more
<br>
efficient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Granted.  This is what happens in war.  War is a crime.  We hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all war and wish to end it.  Ideally all killing should end.  How?
</em><br>
<p>Ideals are not for the real world, because they are self-contradictory.
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Support the peace movement, or we'll kill you.&quot; The only way we could have
<br>
universal peace would be to end life altogether. Killing is part of life. Get
<br>
used to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, we are open to suggestion.  Appeasement will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop the violence.  This planet will not be ruled by the koran.
</em><br>
<p>Nor will this planet be ruled by the Torah nor the Bible...
<br>
That way leads to madness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Honestly, we cannot stop our culture from invading theirs, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we cannot stop radio waves.  Our government does not control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business, it does not control Hollywood Incorporated.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US government cannot be held responsible for that which our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own first amendment prevents it from controlling.
</em><br>
<p>It's not &quot;our&quot; culture anyway... It's simply the modern world, as Fukuyama has
<br>
pointed out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Taliban hate the infidel because they know their own people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will choose the ways of the infidel over the ways of allah,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *if given the freedom to choose*.  If their people can pick up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Baywatch, they will do so.  The reprehensible Taliban fights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by destroying freedom, in order to preserve their deplorable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes.  If you can think of a way to destroy those memes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without destroying the meme carriers, we are open to suggestion.
</em><br>
<p>Commercialism is looking better all the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have no doubts there will be more terrorism.  Our infrastructure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is still very vulnerable, especially airlines and roads.  We need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better technology for discovering and preventing such attacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is something every pacifist will support.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, that's it. We want to be safe and secure, but we also want to be free.
<br>
Hence, the Taliban and Al Quaida must go
<br>
(and I'd add all religious and ideological fanatics as well).
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
