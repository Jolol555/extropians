What To Do About the Recession
<br>
by William L. Anderson
<br>
<p>[Posted November 2, 2001]
<br>

<br>
<p>With the latest news that the U.S. economy officially has been shrinking, it
<br>
is time to admit the obvious: We are in a recession.  Consumer spending is
<br>
down, along with business investment.  The only people making money these
<br>
days are those who contract with the Pentagon.
<br>
<p>Some are claiming that the attacks of September 11 triggered this latest
<br>
economic slide, but all signs point to the fact that the U.S. economy
<br>
already was in recession even before the attacks.  Moreover, there is no
<br>
scarcity of counsel to be given to those we are told are &quot;in charge&quot; of the
<br>
economy, as though there are a few people who can just pull the right levers
<br>
to make things work.  For the most part, we hear the pundits telling
<br>
everyone else what must be done to &quot;stimulate&quot; the economy in order to drive
<br>
it from the doldrums.  Good luck.
<br>
<p>Actually, I would like to give some advice of my own to the august chairman
<br>
of the Federal Reserve System, Mr. Greenspan: Quit, and close down your
<br>
whole operation.  You will not be missed.
<br>
<p>Of course, that is not what we are hearing from the pundits.  Instead, the
<br>
word from nearly all quarters is for the Fed to continue to cut interest
<br>
rates, which it has already done on numerous occasions, with the results
<br>
being that the economy still falters.  We also hear calls for new tax cuts
<br>
that should be targeted to people who would &quot;spend money&quot; and thus
<br>
&quot;stimulate&quot; the economy.
<br>
<p>As an Austrian economist, I am always for tax cuts and more tax cuts,
<br>
because lower taxes mean a smaller state.  However, to say that the chief
<br>
purpose of government policy is to &quot;stimulate&quot; the economy is to engage in
<br>
silly talk.  For all its alleged great powers, the government cannot stop
<br>
this recession.  The government and its wrongheaded policies are responsible
<br>
for this economic calamity, not the hijackers who murdered several thousand
<br>
people, as dreadful as that act was.  (No doubt, even if the economy were
<br>
strong, U.S. productivity would be down in the wake of such a terrible
<br>
event.)  The problem is simple: Bad ideas are leading to bad policies.
<br>
<p>American economists like to think of themselves as a sophisticated lot, but
<br>
to read their numerous policy prescriptions gives further proof that few in
<br>
that profession have progressed beyond Bernard de Mandeville's _The Fable of
<br>
the Bees, or Private Vices Public Benefits_.  The difference between the
<br>
admonitions given by someone like Paul Krugman in the New York Times and
<br>
Mandeville in _Fable of the Bees_ is that Mandeville was a better writer.
<br>
For that matter, &quot;I Want to be a Consumer,&quot; which appeared in the April
<br>
25,1934, edition of _Punch_, describes the Keynesian fallacies even better
<br>
than Keynes and Krugman could do themselves.  At least the editors of Punch
<br>
realized that &quot;stimulating&quot; consumption was a joke, while Krugman takes
<br>
Keynesianism quite seriously.
<br>
<p>Despite the fact that Keynesian &quot;theory&quot; has been discredited time and
<br>
again, it always makes a comeback.  The only point of argument these days
<br>
seems to be what kind of &quot;stimulus&quot; the economy requires, as opposed to why
<br>
this business-cycle bust has happened in the first place.  Until people
<br>
understand why we are in recession and what must be done for the economy to
<br>
climb out and avoid this problem in the future, we are doomed to repeat
<br>
these failures time and again.
<br>
<p>First, repeat after me: Greenspan did not cause this recession by raising
<br>
interest rates in 2000.  That is correct.  Instead, Greenspan helped caused
<br>
this recession by lowering interest rates during the late 1990s.  To put it
<br>
another way, Greenspan's &quot;cure&quot; to fight business-cycle downturns is
<br>
actually responsible for the problem it was trying to correct.
<br>
<p>Conventional wisdom goes as follows: the health of the economy directly
<br>
depends upon aggregate demand.  If consumers are confident and secure, they
<br>
will spend money and the economy will flourish.  However, if consumers lose
<br>
confidence or if they believe the future to be uncertain, then they will
<br>
withhold some spending and drive the economy into recession.  Thus, we have
<br>
been hearing articles about the &quot;heroic consumer&quot; who was supposedly
<br>
propping up the economy until losing heart after the September 11 attacks.
<br>
The terrorists who destroyed the World Trade Towers and damaged the Pentagon
<br>
committed murder and mayhem; however, they are not guilty of causing a
<br>
recession that was already inevitable.  Greenspan did just fine on his own,
<br>
thank you.
<br>
<p>Second, in order to &quot;stimulate&quot; the economy, we must rebate tax dollars to
<br>
consumers so they will spend it quickly; so say the Keynesians.  At this
<br>
point, people on the &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; disagree who should be the main
<br>
beneficiaries of tax cuts.  So-called conservatives argue that cuts in
<br>
capital gains taxes and of high marginal income tax rates will stimulate
<br>
investment, while leftists hold that lower-income people should receive most
<br>
of the cuts, since they are likely to spend money instead of saving or
<br>
investing it like upper-income individuals might do.
<br>
<p>While Austrians obviously would be more sympathetic to the former proposal
<br>
than the latter, most people involved in the current public discussion of
<br>
economics actually are clueless about what causes business cycles.
<br>
Furthermore, their ignorance of the reason economies run through
<br>
boom-and-bust cycles blinds them to the real damage done by government
<br>
policies, regardless of which political party holds power.
<br>
<p>Although I agree that the government should slash tax rates, I believe so
<br>
out of a matter of principle, not because I believe that government has the
<br>
power to &quot;stimulate&quot; private investment.  That the economy is in recession
<br>
in the first place is testament to the policy failures of the U.S.
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>In going back to an earlier statement, let me say again that the
<br>
inevitability of this current recession began when the Fed began to force
<br>
down interest rates during the mid-1990s.  The Fed's actions had a major
<br>
role in triggering a boom, especially in the high-technology sector of the
<br>
economy.  As the boom continued, it was fed by artificially low interest
<br>
rates and a false belief that we had entered a &quot;new economy&quot; in which
<br>
business cycles were a thing of the past.
<br>
<p>Austrian economists--and only the Austrians--were pointing out that the boom
<br>
was not a new era of prosperity that had been created by former President
<br>
Bill Clinton's 1993 tax increases or Secretary of the Treasury Robert
<br>
Rubin's brilliant business strategies.  While we need to acknowledge that
<br>
some of the business, transportation, and financial &quot;deregulation&quot; (or
<br>
re-regulation) of the late 1970s and early 1980s improved the basic climate
<br>
for business investment, the Greenspan-led boom created an atmosphere in
<br>
which billions of dollars became malinvested into lines of production that
<br>
could not be sustained, especially in the high-technology and Internet
<br>
sectors.
<br>
<p>Once those malinvestments took place on a huge scale, it became inevitable
<br>
that a recession would occur.  To put it another way, there was no avoiding
<br>
a bust, once those billions of dollars found their way into unsustainable
<br>
lines of production.
<br>
<p>What about the present efforts of the Fed to stave off the recession by
<br>
lowering interest rates?  For one, those malinvestments that once responded
<br>
to lower interest rates have either been liquidated or are not looking to
<br>
borrow large sums of money.  Thus, at best, this effort by the Fed to create
<br>
massive new amounts of bank reserves is ineffective.
<br>
<p>However, it is doubtful that we can easily walk away from this newest mess
<br>
that Greenspan has created.  Would that the Fed were doing nothing more than
<br>
creating new reserves that won't be used at all.  Unfortunately, that is not
<br>
the case.  By performing aggressive open market operations and by forcing
<br>
interest rates below the rate of inflation, all of which are increasing the
<br>
U.S. money supply at very high rates, the Fed is basically setting the stage
<br>
for the next wave of malinvestments--even before investors have had the
<br>
opportunity to malinvest their funds!
<br>
<p>What should be the proper response, given all that the Fed and the U.S.
<br>
government have done to cause this calamity?  Murray N. Rothbard, in his
<br>
classic _America's Great Depression_, eloquently answers that question:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If government wishes to see a depression ended as quickly as possible,
<br>
and
<br>
the economy returned to normal prosperity, what course should it adopt?  The
<br>
first and clearest injunction is: _don't interfere with the market's
<br>
adjustment process_.  The more the government intervenes to delay the
<br>
market's adjustment, the longer and more grueling the depression will be,
<br>
and the more difficult will be the road to complete recovery. (p. 25,
<br>
italics in original.)
<br>
<p>The prescription for recovery could hardly be clearer.  Yes, cut taxes to
<br>
the bone, because the lower the burden of government, the more private
<br>
investment there will be, and it will be investment that can be sustained,
<br>
not the malinvestments triggered by Greenspan and his allies at the Fed.
<br>
Furthermore, the regulatory state we have created should be cut back
<br>
severely or, even better, abolished altogether.
<br>
<p>This recession does not have to last for a long time.  We have the tools in
<br>
hand to drastically shorten this economic downturn.  It is just that most
<br>
people don't know where to look or, instead, are mistakenly trying to use
<br>
tools that caused the trouble in the first place.
