<p>Yeah, we're pedaling as fast as we can.  I must say I'm a bit surprised
<br>
at how the publicity all came together this week, we couldn't have timed
<br>
it better if we had tried (and we didn't really, we were just scrambling
<br>
for all the press we could get).  We also had the EZ-Rocket on display
<br>
at the Arthur Clarke gala last night:

<br>
rains but it pours :)

<em>&gt; BTW, anyone else notice that the new NASA chief is from its historic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mortal enemy (so far as rivalries go in &quot;allied&quot; beauracracies), the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OMB?  This could be very good for NASA, or very bad for NASA.  Either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, it is likely to be interesting...
</em><br>
<p>I get the impression that O'Keefe will be an interim administrator, kept
<br>
in office just long enough to make some heads roll and shake up a
<br>
stagnant and inefficient bureaucracy.  Interesting times indeed.  Is it
<br>
just me, though, or does he look waaaay too much like Peter Sellers?
<br>
<p>A really *slick* idea has been cooked up by Mircorp- the first hotel in
<br>
orbit, but coorbital with ISS so that after visiting the &quot;Mini Station&quot;,
<br>
the Soyuz crew (including tourists) flies over to ISS, leaves the new
<br>
Soyuz there as a lifeboat, and returns to Earth in the old one.  This
<br>
will let Rosaviakosmos defray the expense of providing Soyuz rotations
<br>
for ISS while keeping the tourists that NASA abhors out of ISS other
<br>
than to go from one Soyuz to the other.  Clever!  The Mini Station
<br>
itself will probably use components that were planned for ISS, but are
<br>
being deleted due to the budget overruns.
