Here's a quote from Greg Egan's novel Diaspora in which Yatima, a
<br>
citizen who lives in a virtual-reality city (&quot;polis&quot;) called Konishi,
<br>
has transfered his mind into an abandoned robot (&quot;gleisner&quot;) he and his
<br>
friend discovered.  He intends to do some exploring in the real world
<br>
and then go back to Konishi polis:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yatima's clone started up in the gleisner body and spent a moment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflecting on vis situation.  The experience of &quot;awakening&quot; felt no
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different from arriving in a new scape; there was nothing to betray
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fact that vis whole mind had just been created anew.  Between
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subjective instants, ve'd been cross-translated from Konishi's dialect
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Shaper, which ran on the virtual machine of a womb or an exoself,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the gleisner version which this robot's highly un-polis-like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardware implemented directly.  In a sense, ve had no past of vis own,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just forged memories and a secondhand personality... but it still
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;felt as if ve'd merely jumped from savanna to jungle, one and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same person before and after.  All invariants intact.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Yatima had been suspended by vis exoself prior to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;translation, and if everything went according to plan that frozen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;snapshot would never need to be re-started.  The Yatima-clone in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gleisner would be re-cloned back into Konishi polis (and re-translated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back into Konishi Shaper) then both the Konishi original and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gleisner-bound clone would be erased.  Philosophically, it wasn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that different from being shifted within the polis from one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;section of physical memory to another - an undetectable act which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the operating system performed on every citizen from time to time,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to reclaim fragmented memory space.  And subjectively, the whole
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excursion would probably be much the same as if they'd puppeted the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gleisners remotely, instead of literally inhabiting them.
<br>
<p>This raises a couple of questions.  First, what &quot;level of reality&quot;
<br>
is Yatima operating at, both when living in Konishi polis and when
<br>
operating in the gleisner robot?  Would the answer be different if he
<br>
had stayed home and puppeted the robot?
<br>
<p>And second, what is happening to his identity here?  Is he right that
<br>
transferring his consciousness from Konishi polis to the brain of the
<br>
robot is no different than transferring it from one piece of the polis
<br>
memory to another?
<br>
<p>If you found yourself living as a citizen of Konishi (never mind whether
<br>
you were the same person as your flesher predecessor), would you be
<br>
comfortable going along with Yatima on this excursion?
<br>
<p>Hal
