I go bu Hans Moravec's thinking that if humanity evolves into a transhuman condition, that of A.I. Superintelligences, the 'brain damage' displayed by the protagonist in Memento, will not occur. Human tissue will conceiavbly be replaced by sterner stuff, annd elaborate neural connections will not suffer the fragility of axions.  
<br>
<p>There may well be other problems, but surely not as severe as what is actually suffered by homo sapien sapien, as well as other mammalian life.
<br>
<p><p>Hal Finney noted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I rented the movie Memento over the weekend, an unusual film noire which
<br>
will be on many top ten lists this year.  I don't want to give away
<br>
the plot, which has a number of surprises and possible inconsistencies,
<br>
but rather to discuss some of the philosophical implications of the film.
<br>
<p>It is not a secret that the movie is about a man, Leonard, who due to an
<br>
injury has lost the ability to form long-term memories.  He can remember
<br>
everything up to the event, but since then he forgets everything that
<br>
has happened.  He can't retain a memory for more than 15 or 30 minutes,
<br>
sometimes less.
<br>
<p>Despite this handicap, Leonard has a goal.  As a substitute for long
<br>
term memory he makes notes to himself and carries labeled photographs.
<br>
And he is at least somewhat effective in making progress towards his
<br>
goal on a day to day basis.
<br>
<p>I see two connections between Leonard's situation and some of the
<br>
issues we have discussed.  One is the question of whether Leonard's
<br>
life has any meaning, and indeed whether in a meaningful sense he is
<br>
living at all.  With his memories constantly being erased, is there any
<br>
point to staying alive?  Dying would erase his memories and his future.
<br>
But his memories are already gone, and in a way the point of a future
<br>
is to give you new memories.  If those are going to be taken from you
<br>
as well, then what is the point of living?
<br>
<p>If you were in Leonard's situation, would you try to live, to improve
<br>
your life?  Or might one just as well give up?
<br>
<p>The second point is that if we manage to survive for a very long time,
<br>
our situation may be much like Leonard's.  If we reject the notion of
<br>
stasis, for what is the point of living forever if you are in a rut,
<br>
then we have to embrace change.  And with enough change, inevitably
<br>
the person you were before will be lost.  While the memories may not
<br>
be totally erased, still you will be effectively a different person&gt;&gt;
