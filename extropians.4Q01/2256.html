<p>First, Do No Harm
<br>
<p>By Christopher Westley
<br>
<p>[November 6, 2001]
<br>
<p>The economy is officially in the tank, and economists are standing in line
<br>
to tell policymakers which levers to pull to bring it back to healthy form.
<br>
Giving advice to political leaders--advice they want to hear--seems to be
<br>
the way to fame in my profession, with the primary concern that the New York
<br>
Times prints your name correctly.
<br>
<p>I too have policy prescriptions. In fact, my recommendations, if
<br>
implemented, would allow the economy to prosper sometime during the first
<br>
quarter of 2002. Although my ideas used to reflect the mainstream of
<br>
economic thinking, today they are considered novel. This is too bad, because
<br>
they promise stable, long-run growth, and not the short-run stimuli that
<br>
serve merely to get politicians past the next election cycle.
<br>
<p>Herewith are my suggestions.
<br>
<p>To Alan Greenspan, who is considered in many circles the most important man
<br>
in the world:  Spend more time with your wife, Andrea Mitchell. Take her
<br>
down to Florida for a few months. You can't beat Boca this time of year, and
<br>
with all of the Fed-engineered malinvestments of the last decade, there are
<br>
many empty hotel rooms down there. Just stay away from your Fed office.
<br>
Sometimes the best Fed policy is no Fed policy. Now is such a time.
<br>
<p>To Dennis Hastert and Tom Daschle: You boys need to spend more time
<br>
together. Hang out at the gym and shoot some hoops. Hit the mall, get
<br>
haircuts, and buy some ties. Tom, you can show Dennis how to tie a double
<br>
windsor knot. And later, Dennis, you can show Tom the double chokehold you
<br>
used during your wrestling days.
<br>
<p>When you leave, be sure to lock up the Capitol. We'll try to make do without
<br>
you. Any time you could have spent productively when Congress was in session
<br>
was wasted last month when you let the deadline pass for the Internet tax
<br>
moratorium and then tried to federalize airport security. We'll sleep a lot
<br>
better out here in the hinterlands knowing that you two are passing a
<br>
football in a Chevy Chase park instead of passing laws.
<br>
<p>And to George W. Bush:  Don't you miss your ranch?  Go back to Crawford, set
<br>
up the horseshoe poles, and invite your dad over. Have you finished the John
<br>
Adams book yet?  If so, why not try reading some Henry Hazlitt?  Be a
<br>
compassionate conservative, and hang out with the citizens you spoke of in
<br>
your inaugural. You will then remember that, contra Keynes, the Liquidity
<br>
Trap is nothing more than the dunking booth at the Methodist church fair.
<br>
<p>There is no need to sign executive orders. In short, my advice to would-be
<br>
economic managers can be summarized in three words: Do no harm.
<br>
<p>This advice runs counter to the political mind, which thinks that the
<br>
elected official must look like he is doing something at all times, no
<br>
matter the present state of the economy. But doing no harm during a time of
<br>
recession is the only way that the economy can assume sustainable growth
<br>
levels once again. Here's why.
<br>
<p>By not intervening, wages and prices will adjust. Wages fall because of the
<br>
surplus of unemployed workers, while prices fall because of the surplus
<br>
output that resulted from the previous boom and because of the cutback in
<br>
consumer demand that is natural during a correction. Some workers take pay
<br>
cuts and reduce labor output by working shorter weeks. If workers' nominal
<br>
wages are reduced while the prices of the goods they buy are reduced as
<br>
well, they are no worse off in real terms. Wage and price deflations are
<br>
essential aspects of the market-clearing process.
<br>
<p>Although no single worker is affected in the same way while these
<br>
adjustments take place, as is implied by aggregate macroeconomic data, such
<br>
a corrective process is never easy. Through it, labor and capital move to
<br>
areas that entrepreneurs hope will be more productive. Business failures are
<br>
liquidated. Lives are disrupted as the newly unemployed try to find work.
<br>
Some families will have to relocate to be closer to new opportunities. On an
<br>
individual basis, some workers never achieve the same level of real income
<br>
that they earned during the boom. Such events are inherent in the market
<br>
system, but they are needlessly exacerbated following state-financed,
<br>
unsustainable periods of economic growth.
<br>
<p>Such events also create enormous political pressure to intervene, but these
<br>
efforts only lengthen the correction. Tinkering with the legal code makes
<br>
property less secure and less likely to be utilized by private individuals
<br>
in ways that promote the social good. Adding layers to government increases
<br>
its size and scope, requiring coerced capital flows from private uses to
<br>
wasteful public ones. Such interventions make politicians look meaningful
<br>
and compassionate, even though they always produce deleterious long-term
<br>
economic effects.
<br>
<p>By providing unemployment compensation, politicians slow adjustments in the
<br>
labor market, which reduces the downward pressure on wages and causes
<br>
unemployment to persist. By protecting industries via direct monetary
<br>
subsidies, low interest loans, or protectionist legislation, politicians
<br>
score political points while rewarding poor business decisions. By
<br>
increasing the money supply, monetary authorities create a new round of
<br>
malinvestments, thus setting the stage for deeper recessions in the future.
<br>
<p>Prior to the Keynesian era, recessions were called panics and had durations
<br>
of about three months. The shortness in duration, which is remarkable given
<br>
that labor and capital mobility was much slower than today, reflected the
<br>
lack of interventionism by extra-market authorities. Today, recessions last
<br>
much longer, as the bad idea that the state should manage the economy has
<br>
become legitimized.
<br>
<p>Which is why I say to members of our political class:  Adopt a do-no-harm
<br>
economic policy.  Stop intervening. Try being irrelevant to the correction.
<br>
A healthy, stable economy growing at sustainable rates of output requires a
<br>
minimalist state.
<br>
<p>Start your holiday break early (after sending me the phone number to the New
<br>
York Times).
