<em>&gt; The U.S. is opposed to a world ban on landmines due to the situation with the Korean demiliterized zone.  The landmines there would really slow down a massive North Korean advance, thereby saving many thousands of American and South Korean lives.

<p>I am no expert but the North is dirt poor compared to South
<br>
Korea.  I seriously doubt that North Korea could hope to gain
<br>
anything from such an attack in any case.  This doesn't seem
<br>
like a great excuse for oppossing banning landmines.  Also, in
<br>
todays warfare, missles and air-power make land attack simply
<br>
not the only or even the best option for the start of
<br>
hostilities. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because we are obsessed with the notion of other nations secretly researching and building such weapons without our knowledge.  This would give them the option of blackmailing the United States.  I think obviously the U.S. does not want to miss the boat on the next technology to be a crucial equalizer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We are obsessed with any nation having the means to oppose
<br>
whatever we wish to do in the world to be succinct. 
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; If we had such a treaty for weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. and United Nations would be kept very busy with invading the rogue states who are in violation!  We would have a Gulf or Afghan war every year...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The Afghan war had nothing to do with any such thing.  Neither
<br>
did Desert Storm.  Those are only subsidiary excuses.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course, all very powerful nations would be given &quot;get out of jail free!&quot; cards.  We can't risk WWIII by invading folks who are too numerous and well-armed!  And I seriously doubt the U.N. will mount a military expedition against the U.S. if we are found to be treaty violators! lol!
</em><br>
<p>Not funny.  I am very slowly coming around to the view that the
<br>
UN should have the best firepower.  Except then they would be
<br>
the Great Bully.  Failing that, it is in the interest of freedom
<br>
as long as we insist on using violence with one another, that
<br>
more states are well armed and able to resist agression rather
<br>
than less.  Of course, personally, I believe that we don't stand
<br>
a chance of surviving much longer without eschewing violence as
<br>
completely as possible (the Vulcan model?).
