</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;From where I'm standing, religiosity looks like playing by

</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my opinion, it is not &quot;subjective&quot; unless opposed to too

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, ok.
<br>
<p>* Could you be a little more specific on what exactly it is beyond logic and
<br>
reason that you are using here that doesn't involve taking something on
<br>
faith? What external and internal inputs determine knowing that something
<br>
should be done when you would prefer not to do it?
<br>
<p>* What is too limited a notion of objective? I was always in the camp of
<br>
pretty hard and fast definitions of both subjective and objective.
<br>
<p>* What definition would you give to &quot;truth&quot; that is different from
<br>
&quot;something determined and proven by the scientific method&quot;?
<br>
