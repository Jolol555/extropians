<p>Paradigm mismatch.
<br>
<p>Computer code is inherently of utility in and of itself.  Programmers
<br>
have a need, as do other programmers, so they share their bits of the
<br>
solution.  There is nothing to balance this solution against, in the
<br>
same sense as balancing civil defense vs. other approaches to security.
<br>
<p>Security is a response to people doing various detrimental acts to
<br>
property and other people.  The ideal security is where there are no
<br>
enemies willing to stoop that low.  But there is no &quot;need&quot; for security
<br>
itself, just a need to make sure the things which the security guards
<br>
against never happen.  Security is one solution to this need; other,
<br>
more popular ones (since they are cheaper and usually more effective)
<br>
include diplomacy and economic motivation.  The problem is, when these
<br>
approaches fail, investment in them tends to be to the near-complete
<br>
neglect of anything that could be recognized as civil defense.  The
<br>
government currently compensates for this by spending (IMO, too much)
<br>
on military, though this can be done to the neglect of diplomacy and
<br>
economic motivation...with results that we are currently seeing.  Thus,
<br>
in the immediate future, &quot;open source&quot; would recruit mostly people who
<br>
seek to shift this balance the other way to any degree...and wind up
<br>
with not much defense at all.
