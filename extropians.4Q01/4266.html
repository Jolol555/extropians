<p>
Dear Extropes,
<br>
<p>I returned to Heidelberg 1.5 days ago from my business/personal trip
<br>
to the U.S., and since this was my first trip back 'home' to the
<br>
U.S. since September 11, I am compelled to note my observations of
<br>
how the U.S. appears to me these days.
<br>
<p>First, for those of you women who have upcoming travels: it seems
<br>
that women traveling alone are a red flag for U.S. airport security
<br>
(not so much in Europe). I didn't succeed in escaping the 'random
<br>
security checks' in the four U.S. airports I passed through
<br>
(Washington D.C., New Orleans, Los Angeles, San Francisco). I was
<br>
_always_ pulled aside and questioned, and sometimes me or my
<br>
hand-luggage searched.
<br>
<p>Other observations:
<br>
<p>An American flag phenomenon, everywhere. It used to be that one saw
<br>
only the American flag on government buildings, schools and on
<br>
politician's cars as they campaigned, but not only these anymore.
<br>
They are on people's houses, on some ~20% (or more) of the cars. If
<br>
not the American flag, then stickers of the Amercan flag, or
<br>
clothing pins of the American flag, which can be bought near the
<br>
cash register of almost every store (gas stations, etc.) Sometimes I
<br>
got the sense that houses in neighborhoods were competing with each
<br>
other for the biggest flag, or the most flags. Or sometimes I got
<br>
the impression that the flags were more like a fashionable trend.
<br>
<p>Along with the flags were equal numbers of stickers on cars, in
<br>
windows of stores and houses with the words: &quot;United We Stand&quot; or
<br>
&quot;God Bless America&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my 37 years living in the U.S., I find this phenomena odd. The
</em><br>
U.S. is a mix of an incredible number of many things and people that
<br>
never was, and never will 'united'. Besides, I'm rather partial to
<br>
the Earth, the Solar System, and the Milky Way, and I generally
<br>
abhor boundaries (one of the reasons I moved to live outside of the
<br>
U.S.). I would rather those flags and stickers show pictures of the
<br>
Solar System (&quot;Sol we Shine&quot;) or the Milky Way (&quot;Universe Bless the
<br>
Milky Way&quot;).
<br>
<p>The media (newspaper, TV news) has created a deluge of
<br>
War-in-Afghanistan news with at least 1/2 of the &quot;A&quot; news section
<br>
devoted to this topic every day, and at least 1/2 of the TV news
<br>
every day. Often the news is generated via a media circus. No wonder
<br>
so many of my family and friends are saturated with the news, and no
<br>
wonder the 'War' is in front of so many people's minds every day. If
<br>
I was living there, I would find it very difficult to think of
<br>
alternative peaceful solutions to the 'War' with the media hammering
<br>
away as it is.
<br>
<p>The means to generate funds to benefit those close to the September 11
<br>
victims appears to be taken to new levels I've not seen before: product
<br>
labels carrying elements of the September 11 events, and some number
<br>
of products for sale state that proceeds go towards the victims. The
<br>
latter would be fine to me, but I thought that the commercialization was
<br>
too... slick. Like selling cars. I would rather grieve about the
<br>
September 11, losses without the commercialization.
<br>
<p>Finally, I observed a transformation in America, that frankly scared
<br>
me. It's there now, and is trickling outside. Fear, suspicions,
<br>
sometimes paranoia. Boundaries and borders are being heavily
<br>
fortified, civil rights are being trampled right and left, and for
<br>
the most part, I didn't hear people complaining about that (the one
<br>
exception was the the ~1000 people who are held in jails with no due
<br>
process for 'suspicious terrorist activity'). In human history's
<br>
most wretched times,  people were labeled and then burned,
<br>
quartered, persecuted, and I see this kind of fear-based labelling
<br>
on people appearing again. I couldn't escape the feeling that the
<br>
place where I was born and lived for most of my life (the U.S.) has
<br>
gone a little bit insane.
<br>
<p>Before I moved out of the U.S. ~4 years ago, I was, in a small way, a
<br>
pacifist, believing that one doesn't answer violence with yet again
<br>
more violence. I also believe that any group's rampant unhappiness
<br>
or disrest has an element of truth embedded, and it must be
<br>
addressed in a civil way, or the violent cycle will continue. The
<br>
events since September 11, and my U.S. observations the last weeks,
<br>
have polarized me (unexpectedly) much more as a pacifist, and I know
<br>
now that the U.S. is not a good fit as an environment for me to live
<br>
(or to raise a kid).
<br>
<p>I don't know if my observations are useful to anyone in the U.S. and
<br>
I won't entertain arguments or debates, since they are mostly my
<br>
observations. I'll only state that I'm very worried with the
<br>
direction that the U.S. humans (and others) on this planet are
<br>
following.
