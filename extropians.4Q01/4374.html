<p>You mean, a remote brain wash to &quot;make them like we are&quot; would be an 
<br>
ethical solution? Isn't that exactly what they tried, with todays primitive 
<br>
technology? IMO, they succeeded. Two billion people are in fear of two 
<br>
thousand fanatics. Liberal, free countries go for suppressive, 
<br>
pre-democratic rules, where people are put into jail because of their skin, 
<br>
beard or accent. The self-proclaimed leading nation for human rights, 
<br>
freedom and equality thinks about torture and secret tribunals. 
<br>
<p>See, there you have a massive change of a meme system.
<br>
<p>I understand that the US-american law system is still stuck in 
<br>
seventeenhundretsomething, but should we really follow the terrorists right 
<br>
into the middle ages?
<br>
<p>Now, to get on-topic, what would be the appropriate action to perform a 
<br>
likewise change of the extreme fundamentalist meme system (Taliban as well 
<br>
as Ashcroft...) into a liberal, more extropian? Certainly not bombs on 
<br>
tents.
