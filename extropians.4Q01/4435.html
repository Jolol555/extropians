</em><br>
<p>Part of the problem is we are fighting memes that were recorded
<br>
on dead trees many centuries ago.  These cannot change.
<br>
<p>One example you bring up, Samantha is the presence of American
<br>
troops in Saudi Arabia causing Muslim hatred towards us, since
<br>
Mohammed said on his deathbed to never allow the infidel there.
<br>
Some have suggested that we could make OBL happy by pulling
<br>
US troops out of Saudi Arabia.
<br>
<p>The immediate problem I see with this approach is that the
<br>
US troops are in Saudi Arabia with the blessing of the Saudi
<br>
government.  So the immediate question is why did not OBL
<br>
take over Saudi planes and crash them into Saudi buildings?
<br>
Why does not the Taliban seek to overthrow the Saudi
<br>
government, then install themselves as the government there,
<br>
so that they could then legitimately negotiate with the US
<br>
on such matters?
<br>
<p>If the Taliban is interested in Israel's treatment of the Palestinians,
<br>
then why did not the Taliban take over Israeli planes and crash
<br>
them into Israeli buildings, or attempt to overthrow the Israeli
<br>
government, in order to install itself as government there, so
<br>
that they could then negotiate.
<br>
<p>If the Taliban's struggle is against christianity, well, I really
<br>
don't know what to tell them.  I struggle against christianity
<br>
too, in a sense.
<br>
<p>For the Taliban to hold the US responsible for the actions of
<br>
the Saudi government, the Israeli government, and Christian
<br>
missionaries, and to express their anger by slaying innocent
<br>
US citizens is the most reprehensible act I can imagine.  I do
<br>
not see how we could legitimately negotiate with such people.  spike
