</em><br>

<em>&gt; As you know the creation of ideas is copyrightable under our law

<p>So in your mind &quot;illegal&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; are the same thing? So smoking
<br>
a joint _should_ be a felony, even if it's to relieve nausea from
<br>
chemotherapy, and betting on a football game or having some friends
<br>
over for poker is wrong in those states where it's illegal and right
<br>
in those states where it's legal?  Yeah, right.
<br>
<p>You don't believe that, and using that to justify your refusal to
<br>
look at your ethical position on copyright is dishonest and cowardly.
<br>
Don't hide behind the law--tell us what you think is actually right
<br>
and wrong; and back up your opinion.
<br>
<p>I know the details of copyright law much better than you do, trust
<br>
me.  Probably better than most IP lawyers.  I'm also willing to stand
<br>
up and say what I think is right and wrong, regardless of the law.
<br>
Those un-Extropian minds who confuse ethics with legality get no
<br>
respect from me--they have abdicated the use of their minds to the
<br>
unwashed masses, and deserve the result.
