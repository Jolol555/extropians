<p>&quot;Mesh radio&quot; can deliver super-fast internet for all 19:00 21 November 01 
<br>
Barry Fox 
<br>
A new type of high-capacity wireless network called mesh radio will get its
<br>
first users early in 2002 - a hundred lucky households in Cardiff, Wales. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;It will let them watch movies on demand, hold broadcast-quality video chats 
</em><br>
with
<br>
their neighbours, and download from the internet at a blistering four 
<br>
megabits
<br>
per second - many times the speed of wired broadband delivery systems like 
<br>
ADSL
<br>
and cable modems.
<br>
<p>Even better, says its developers, mesh radio will not slow down when a lot of
<br>
people try to use it at the same time. Home ADSL services typically provide a
<br>
maximum data rate of 500 kilobits per second, but the bandwidth available to 
<br>
a
<br>
user is much lower if several people in the street are online at the same 
<br>
time.
<br>
Cable modems are similar. 
<br>
<p>Conventional wireless data systems, known as multipoint video distribution
<br>
services (MVDS) networks, use a powerful base station with a tall antenna to
<br>
broadcast to homes over a wide area. Also dubbed &quot;wireless cable&quot; networks, 
<br>
they
<br>
are often used in rural areas in the US where it's uneconomic to lay cable. 
<br>
But any tall buildings in the way, or even a tree, absorbs the signals, 
<br>
creating
<br>
blind spots where homes cannot communicate. As a result, a base station may
<br>
&quot;see&quot; only one-third of the homes in its area.
<br>
Mini base station
<br>
<p>Mesh radio achieves nearly 100 per cent cover by turning each home into a 
<br>
mini
<br>
base station. A stubby unit on the roof, hides four directional antennas with
<br>
motors that automatically align them with other antennas on other houses. 
<br>
This allows each node to communicate with several others at the same time. If
<br>
contact is lost, it can automatically readjust its antenna to point to a
<br>
different one.
<br>
A network control centre - or master node - connects to an optical-fibre 
<br>
trunk
<br>
line connected to video and Internet resources. The data flowing round the
<br>
network is labelled so that each home has its own private, indirect 
<br>
connection
<br>
to the trunk. 
<br>
The system on trial in Cardiff, and further trials planned for the US, Spain 
<br>
and
<br>
Germany, works at 28 gigahertz - in the millimetre waveband. Later systems 
<br>
will
<br>
work at 40 gigahertz. Two-way data rates of four megabits per second are said 
<br>
to
<br>
be possible for up to 600 subscribers per square kilometre. 
<br>
<p>Health effects 
<br>
The mesh radio idea has been developed and patented by Cambridge company 
<br>
Radiant Networks, but it is a conventional telecoms company, BT, that's 
<br>
running the
<br>
Cardiff consumer trial. BT already runs an ADSL service, and wants to see if 
<br>
the
<br>
mesh idea works as well as Radiant predicts. Compared with cellphones, mesh 
<br>
technology may raise fewer concerns over radiation health effects. It 
<br>
operates at higher frequencies than the microwaves used by cellphone 
<br>
networks, allowing the signals to travel high in the air in a tight 
<br>
line-of-sight beam. Power levels will be less than one watt, whereas 
<br>
cellphone masts push out eight watts...&lt;&lt;
