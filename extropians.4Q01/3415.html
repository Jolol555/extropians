I don't think that there is a problem with *being able* to get this 
<br>
information across, its just that, since it isn't part of the grammatical 
<br>
structure many people neglect it in their communications.  For instance, 
<br>
most people would say that &quot;Jessica is going out with Billy&quot; without any 
<br>
sort of specification.  If the language forced people to tell how sure they 
<br>
were of something, and if that telling could be done in one syllable 
<br>
instead of five, I think that there would be a definite decrease in the 
<br>
amount of BS around.
