</em><br>
<p>This is interesting as a list of some things that spirituality is, or might
<br>
be. 
<br>
<p>However, I would list all of these as attributes of my personal value
<br>
system, and yet I would never consider myself a &quot;spiritual&quot; person; far from
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Similarly, I believe a lot of people who call themselves &quot;spiritual&quot; might
<br>
not share all these attributes. &quot;valuing all human beings deeply&quot; might be
<br>
quite untrue for many self-professed spiritual people, some of whom might
<br>
use, as an example, a relatively implicit and unconscious &quot;us vs them&quot; meme.
<br>
The &quot;winning = me winning&quot; seems to adequately describe a lot of new age
<br>
sh*te. If you look at (dumber) parts of the conservation movement, you often
<br>
see an implicit (or explicit!) anti-human agenda, and I bet plenty of those
<br>
people profess to be &quot;spiritual&quot;. Gaeia, anyone?
<br>
<p>I'm highly suspicious of the label &quot;spiritual&quot;. What is it, which is not
<br>
defined in opposition to rationality? Don't you devalue rational/scientific
<br>
enquiry merely by using the term?
<br>
<p>Sure, I agree that we are more than rationality machines... there is
<br>
something of the unfathomable to being human, to experiencing life, which
<br>
goes beyond the mundane; something essential. Those prize qualities of
<br>
humanity... motivation, inspiration, imagination... come directly out of
<br>
this unknown side of us.
<br>
<p>However, it is merely unknown, and not even completely that. I am confident
<br>
that, in the fullness of time, after much dedicated enquiry, we will
<br>
understand these parts of our nature/intelligence as surely as we can
<br>
understand anything else. As lighted on in the thread about Midochlorians
<br>
and Star Wars, we may well lose some of the mystique (and the mystic) in the
<br>
discovery of truth. Be that as it may.
<br>
<p>The most charitable interpretation I can make of the attribute of
<br>
&quot;spirituality&quot; is that of being comfortable with that most unknown, and
<br>
powerful, side of oneself. However, I really believe that the label is so
<br>
loaded down with connotations of the supernatural and mystical nonsense,
<br>
that it really should be discarded in favour of something more utilitarian.
<br>
&quot;Inspirationality&quot;? &quot;Non-linearity&quot;? I'm open to suggestions. 
<br>
<p>But &quot;spirituality&quot;? I don't think so.
