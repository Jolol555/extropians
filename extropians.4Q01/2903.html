<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As laudable as these things are, we have absolutely no right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; impose any system of government on Afghanistan or any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I thought you said you weren't a relativist.  Some actions, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some practices of government and/or culture, are both inherently evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and inherently dangerous to the safety and well-being of others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought that you weren't for the US running the affairs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other nations.  If you believe in sovereign states then it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not defensible to disrupt another state just because you do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the way it is run.
</em><br>
<p>Sovereign _individuals_ are more important than sovereign states.
<br>
A state that tramples the rights of its people has no right to exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It's a little harder to make a similar case for Afghanistan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but the idea that there's _nothing_ they or any other nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could do that would justify active intervention is nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a total abrogation of the responsibility for self-defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If, for example, there were old Soviet nuclear weapons there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we would be ethically required to use force to ensure that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government set up there could properly deal with them, or else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we would have to remove them by force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did not say that there was nothing they could do, etc.  I said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is no inherent right that we have to force our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural values and governmental style on another sovereign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation.  There is quite a large difference.
</em><br>
<p>But only a relativist thinks all values are &quot;cultural&quot;.  Some
<br>
values are absolute, and a government that violates the rights
<br>
of its people has no right to sovereignty, even if 95% of the
<br>
people in that country want it that way.  Freedom is an absolute
<br>
right of individuals, even those in an extreme minority or in
<br>
a foreign culture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hmmm.  Most of the old Soviet nuclear weapons are still in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russia and there is good reason to believe that they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally well-managed and safe today.  Are we then ethically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required to forcefully go in an seize these weapons before they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come to harm?
</em><br>
<p>If the Russian government destabilized to the point where
<br>
anti-US terrorists could get control of them, yes.  Russia is
<br>
a bit messed up, but it's not that bad yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is a difficult and unsolved problem in libertarian ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and politics to determine exactly when and under what conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an imminent threat or danger rises to the level to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defensive force; but there is such a level, and those judgments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do have to be made.  Absolute dogmatic non-interventionism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irrational and dangerous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure.  As it is irrational and dangerous for us to go pull the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; splinter out of another country's eye while ignoring the beam in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our own.  
</em><br>
<p>I've never argued otherwise.  Indeed, I've prety consistently
<br>
argued that the US government is a criminal organization, and that
<br>
our foreign policy is stupid and inconsistent.  But let's not go
<br>
from there to say that we must correct it by completely pulling
<br>
out of all foreign relations.  We correct it by enforcing policies
<br>
that are more sensible and consistent, and some of those policies
<br>
can and will call for intervention in foreign governments, so long
<br>
as we do it sparingly and for the right reasons.
