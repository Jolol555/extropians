What you have stated seems to make solid sense. But it isn't our world today 
<br>
as its currently constituted amongst nation states and ethnic groups. I 
<br>
surmise that the format for such a civilizational order, as you have listed 
<br>
in your post, suggests massive changes in global human society, pre-occuring 
<br>
this development.
<br>
<p>Your post is prefigured in Hans Moravec's Robot, in the paragraphs titled, 
<br>
&quot;The Death of Capitalism,&quot; in which Moravec predicts the collapse of 
<br>
traditional capitalism through the application of advanced robot technology 
<br>
(what else?). Moravec envisions the nations of the world be transfigured into 
<br>
tribal units, as the great cities decline and the populations are 
<br>
distributed, and supplied by good and serviced literally piped in, or 
<br>
produced in situ.
<br>
<p>I respectfully maintain (not that anyone seems to care ;-)  )  that this 
<br>
epoch is definitively NOT here yet, and its dangerously premature, and 
<br>
potential damaging to our national/global economy. Not everyone will see 
<br>
things as you do and even game theory is not based on anything that excludes 
<br>
Reciprocity and Mutuality. Your goal and rule-set is admirable, but if Saddam 
<br>
decides to pee in the soup while you employ  your meta-goals, we all could 
<br>
get screwed. We need new technologies in-hand, for something as you have 
<br>
described to work.
<br>
<p><a href="mailto:cyixiong@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20One%20Unity,%20Different%20Ideologies,%20all%20in%20the%20same%20universe&In-Reply-To=&lt;d0.1fc238c9.295ac680@aol.com&gt;">cyixiong@yahoo.com</a> forthrightly opined:
<br>
<p>:::1) Communities cannot detain people who wish to leave
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) They can restrict the people they take
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Those who choose to stay or enter without permission will subject
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves to the internal rules of the community (such as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;punishment)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Communities cannot interfere in the affairs of the other communities 
<br>
who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signed this treaty
<br>
<p>Given this, no dictator can rule his or her own people without having
<br>
concern about them because these people can always choose to
<br>
go to another community. Meanwhile, it does not deprive others of the choice
<br>
to join, say, this dictatorship because of certain
<br>
(perceived) advantages that we might not consider rational (such as for
<br>
religious reasons).
<br>
<p><p>Such a world would provide vastly more choice for all people than say, one
<br>
dominated by socialist sentient AI (I mean this in a
<br>
positive way!) or a world dominated by an anacho-capitalist society. We
<br>
should not assume that people will have the same goals as us
<br>
(such as the pursuit of self-interest) or even that they have no goals at
<br>
all, but to provide them with choices such that they can
<br>
choose their own path.
<br>
<p>This could stop a lot of conflicts from happening because if people can live
<br>
the way they disire, then presumely they would not need
<br>
to fight for their &quot;cause&quot; whether we consider these rational or not. The
<br>
exception, of course, lies with those whose ideologies
<br>
require them to enslave or at least &quot;take over the world&quot;. This could cause
<br>
some problems until a system exists to keep them in
<br>
check (or wait until most people venture space leaving these people with a
<br>
sparsely populated planet Earth).::::
<br>
<p><p>I suggest considering this approach of &quot;many ideologies, many societies&quot;
<br>
over alternative approaches that champion any one of the
<br>
proposed social systems. No shoe can fit everyone and we should learn that
<br>
the easy, rather than the hard way.
