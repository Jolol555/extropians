<p><p><p><em>&gt;. If I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could choose between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2 more years of Emlyn and 0 years of Emlyn',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0 more years of Emlyn and 1000 years of Emlyn',
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would choose the latter, most certainly. But not for the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons! Particularly, I'd be doing it for &quot;the wife and kids&quot;. To me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would not be life extension, it would actually be a huge personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrifice. I'd have to do it in secret, too, because it'd only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be fair on my family if they never knew.
</em><br>
Actually, your family has been in contact. They say that they are quite
<br>
alright with it and
<br>
have actually requested a few changes in the duplicate Emlyn. ;)
<br>
<em>&gt; Which of the following would you (as a functionalist) do. Which would you
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; as yourself? Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 - Live out your 3 score &amp; 10.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2 - Be replaced** tomorrow by your exact (enough) replica, who will live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1000 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3 - Be replaced** tomorrow by an exact (enough) replica of person X, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will live 1000 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Well, depending on how the details are filled in here, I think I can imagine
<br>
adopting anyone of these. There might be occasions where I might adopt (3),
<br>
for example, even though I would not consider this a case of continuity of
<br>
identity. Ethical considerations might compel one to sacrifice oneself for
<br>
another. With (2) I am not sure how to interpret 'exact enough'. Not just
<br>
any good looking, witty, and brilliant individual will be an exact enough
<br>
replica of me to ensure  that I will think  there is a continuity of
<br>
identity.
<br>
So where do we disagree? Generally, personal identity is considered to be a
<br>
special case of identity, which put formally is something like A=A. Of
<br>
course
<br>
in its formal mode it tells us almost nothing. A slightly more helpful
<br>
suggestion is that a necessary condition for the continuity of identity of A
<br>
is that all purported instances of A must share the same necessary
<br>
properties. Of course in the present case this does not help us much since
<br>
now our disagreement resolves to which properties are necessary for me to be
<br>
me, or you to be you. That is, we disagree whether it is an essential
<br>
property of an individual that the right sort of continuity obtains for
<br>
one's present microphysical constitution. On my view, the continuity of my
<br>
present microphysical structure is only a contingent property of my
<br>
identity, e.g., I could be moved to a different substratum and survive. The
<br>
continuity of my beliefs, desires, projects, and the 'narrative of my life'
<br>
seems so much more important than worrying about what platform this takes
<br>
place on--this set of molecules or that set of molecules. On the other hand,
<br>
I am nominalist enough to think that there is not a lot in the
<br>
contingent/necessary property distinction.
