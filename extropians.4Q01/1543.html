</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Hypothetically, what if there was a religion (not Islam, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypothetical religion that doesn't exist at all in our timeline)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diametrically opposed to the liberal, secular, rational, humanist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;egalitarian values. Would it be acceptable for us to regard this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion as a problem rather than as a valid point of view, much like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we regard bigotry and hatred as problems rather than as opinions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Have we arrived at a paradox?
</em><br>
<p>Some people (myself and J.R. Molloy included) *do* view religion as a 
<br>
problem (if not *the* problem).  But the problem with that problem is how to 
<br>
deal with it in a &quot;liberal, secular, rational, humanist, egalitarian&quot; way?  
<br>
The only way I see is by meme warfare.  But this is admittedly an 
<br>
excrutiatingly slow way to wipe out theism.  Particularly since religions 
<br>
are like Chinese handcuffs.  The more you pull, the more resistant it 
<br>
becomes.

<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
