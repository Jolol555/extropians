<em>&gt;From: Amara Graps &lt;<a href="mailto:amara@amara.com?Subject=Re:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;200112141530.HAA18272@well.com&gt;">amara@amara.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;An American flag phenomenon, everywhere. It used to be that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saw only the American flag on government buildings, schools and on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;politician's cars as they campaigned, but not only these anymore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They are on people's houses, on some ~20% (or more) of the cars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If not the American flag, then stickers of the Amercan flag, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clothing pins of the American flag, which can be bought near the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cash register of almost every store (gas stations, etc.) Sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I got the sense that houses in neighborhoods were competing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each other for the biggest flag, or the most flags. Or sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I got the impression that the flags were more like a fashionable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trend.
</em><br>
<p>Most of these items are marked &quot;made in China&quot;.
<br>
<p>Real patriots didn't need to go looking for a flag.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Along with the flags were equal numbers of stickers on cars, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;windows of stores and houses with the words: &quot;United We Stand&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;God Bless America&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>Getting the &quot;God&quot; thing stuffed down your throat everywhere is a
<br>
bit much.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;From my 37 years living in the U.S., I find this phenomena odd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The U.S. is a mix of an incredible number of many things and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people that never was, and never will 'united'. Besides, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather partial to the Earth, the Solar System, and the Milky Way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I generally abhor boundaries (one of the reasons I moved to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;live outside of the U.S.). I would rather those flags and stickers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;show pictures of the Solar System (&quot;Sol we Shine&quot;) or the Milky
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Way (&quot;Universe Bless the Milky Way&quot;).
</em><br>
<p><p>Fly an earth flag, I do.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The media (newspaper, TV news) has created a deluge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;War-in-Afghanistan news with at least 1/2 of the &quot;A&quot; news section
</em><br>
<em>&gt;devoted to this topic every day, and at least 1/2 of the TV news
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every day. Often the news is generated via a media circus. No
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wonder so many of my family and friends are saturated with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;news, and no wonder the 'War' is in front of so many people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minds every day. If I was living there, I would find it very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult to think of alternative peaceful solutions to the 'War'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the media hammering away as it is.
</em><br>
<p><p>We are at war, not at peace. Although we hope to re-establish it
<br>
(peace) soon.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Finally, I observed a transformation in America, that frankly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scared me. It's there now, and is trickling outside. Fear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspicions, sometimes paranoia. Boundaries and borders are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heavily fortified, civil rights are being trampled right and left,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and for the most part, I didn't hear people complaining about that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(the one exception was the the ~1000 people who are held in jails
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with no due process for 'suspicious terrorist activity'). In human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history's most wretched times,  people were labeled and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;burned, quartered, persecuted, and I see this kind of fear-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;labelling on people appearing again. I couldn't escape the feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the place where I was born and lived for most of my life (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;U.S.) has gone a little bit insane.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>People have been made rudely aware that there is evil afoot in the
<br>
world, and they are justifiably scared. Those who have lived a
<br>
sheltered life are scared the most.
<br>
<p><p>Yes, a bunch of people are currently being detained for being in
<br>
this country illegally during a wartime situation. They have
<br>
rights, and they will get them, but they may have to wait a bit.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Before I moved out of the U.S. ~4 years ago, I was, in a small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way, a pacifist, believing that one doesn't answer violence with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yet again more violence. I also believe that any group's rampant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unhappiness or disrest has an element of truth embedded, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must be addressed in a civil way, or the violent cycle will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue. The events since September 11, and my U.S. observations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the last weeks, have polarized me (unexpectedly) much more as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pacifist, and I know now that the U.S. is not a good fit as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environment for me to live (or to raise a kid).
</em><br>
<p>The Taliban and Al Quaeda were out to create an fundamentalist
<br>
Islamic planet, and they murdered those who got in the way,
<br>
including the pacifists.
<br>
<p>Once you start killing people, discussion time is over.
<br>
<p>Imagine trying to raise a kid under Taliban controlled
<br>
Afghanistan...
<br>
<p>Get some perspective.
<br>
<p>Don't worry, armed troops are defending your right to be a
<br>
pacifist.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I don't know if my observations are useful to anyone in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I won't entertain arguments or debates, since they are mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my observations. I'll only state that I'm very worried with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direction that the U.S. humans (and others) on this planet are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;following.
</em><br>
<p><p>Things are messy right now, But I have confidence everything will
<br>
turn out allright. (with a lot of hard/smart work)
