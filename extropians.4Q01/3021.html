</em><br>
<em>&gt; The above factor has been one the most depressing

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree with you, Harvey.  However, I find it somewhat
<br>
surprising that no attempt to find a solution has been
<br>
set in motion.  A solution which, IMO, is neither
<br>
difficult nor onerous.
<br>
<p>The list supposedly has rules as to what is and is not
<br>
allowed, but enforcement is all but non-existent.  It
<br>
seems to me that the ambitions of the Extropy
<br>
Institute--more specifically Max, Greg, Natasha, et
<br>
al, ie, those who have invested huge parts of there
<br>
life to make ExI what it is, and to make its mark in
<br>
the world--are being sacrificed--at least here on the
<br>
list--by a failure on the part of the list &quot;owners&quot; to
<br>
enforce a minimum standard of courtesy/respect (dare I
<br>
say &quot;adult&quot; behavior).
<br>
<p>I've noted that Damien, Harvey, Lee Daniel, and
<br>
Eliezer have all commented CAREFULLY about the
<br>
character of John Clark's discourse in his
<br>
back-and-forth with Samantha.  Too carefully, in my
<br>
opinion.  John's posts have been, simply put, abusive,
<br>
and he should have been censured the moment he started
<br>
with the &quot;puke, spewage, idiot, etc&quot; language.  
<br>
<p>The responsibility for the destruction of the
<br>
reputation of ExI, and of the list and all its
<br>
participants does not, however, rest with John Clark,
<br>
but with the list owners and their failure to insist
<br>
on and enforce a standard of respect for the discourse
<br>
in this forum.
<br>
<p>I call for the list owners to look at the list, assess
<br>
the problem, and work toward a solution.  Those who
<br>
are unwilling or unable to control their
<br>
disruptive/destructive impulses must not be allowed,
<br>
under a misguided conception of &quot;freedom of
<br>
speech&quot;--freedom requires self-discipline and a
<br>
respect for the reciprocal rights of others--to
<br>
destroy what others have built or are trying to build.
<br>
<p>I hate to get preachy, but this is an old, clear,
<br>
well-defined problem--ill-mannered behavior--with a
<br>
straightforward solution: a policy with teeth: behave
<br>
or be gone.
<br>
<p>Let's discuss how this is to be done, and then DO IT.
<br>
<p>It's time for the list needs to grow to the next
<br>
level.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
