Thank you, all of you.
<br>
<p>We should remember that agreement isn't necessarily a sign of conformity
<br>
or political correctness.  We all agree that the Earth goes around the
<br>
Sun, that molecules are made of atoms, and that humans can breathe oxygen
<br>
but not sulfuric acid; and the vast majority of us similarly agree that
<br>
transhumanism is a philosophy which encourages people to look to their
<br>
common identity as citizens of the Solar System and not one region or
<br>
ethnicity.  My purpose in asking people to voice their usually unspoken
<br>
assent was not to enforce conformity or to run the opposing viewpoint off
<br>
the list, but simply to show the world that the prolifically expressed
<br>
opinions of a few posters do not represent the opinions of Extropians as a
<br>
whole.  If we are going to run an open list and tolerate all ideas, even
<br>
really awful ideas on the part of people who are willing to go on arguing
<br>
indefinitely, then we need to make sure that everyone else speaks up now
<br>
and then, or people will get the impression that the most prolific posters
<br>
represent transhumanism.  The flood of positive responses shows what most
<br>
of us believe.  The frequently included quibbles, rephrasings, and &quot;I
<br>
disagree with the part where you say...&quot; have amply shown up the remarks
<br>
about &quot;lemmings&quot; and &quot;political correctness&quot; as flamebait.
<br>
