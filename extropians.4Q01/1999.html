</em><br>
<p>There are lots of problems with this.
<br>
<p>First, what is defined as &quot;criminal&quot; varies from culture to culture.
<br>
In the U.S. many drug offenses are felonies.  In the Netherlands
<br>
they carry much less significance if any.  In the U.S. we provide
<br>
the death penalty for many serious crimes while in Europe that
<br>
is generally viewed with disdain (in spite of the fact that at
<br>
least some evidence suggests it does act as a deterrent to violent
<br>
crime).
<br>
<p>Second, terrorists are not &quot;irrational&quot;.  Their behavior is *entirely*
<br>
rational given their beliefs (that they will be awarded 72 virgins
<br>
upon arrival in heaven, that the U.S. is out to destroy Islam, that
<br>
the Jews are infidels, etc.).  Their behavior is to be admired because
<br>
given their beliefs and their rational pursuit of such beliefs they can
<br>
overcome genetic programming that would tend to seek self-preservation.
<br>
<p>Third, the &quot;uncivilized&quot; societies are those that allow themselves
<br>
to be guided by secular materialistic perspectives instead of
<br>
allowing the wisdom of Allah to guide their actions (at least
<br>
from the perspective of many millions of people).
<br>
<p>Reading the link that Joe provided to the NY Times article:
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/14/international/asia/14SCHO.html?pagewanted">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/14/international/asia/14SCHO.html?pagewanted</a>
<br>
about the Islamic schools was rather enlightening.  Up to 1 million people
<br>
being brainwashed ~every decade to base their actions on a book 1300 years
<br>
out of date.  This includes being indoctrinated to despise Israel and the U.S.
<br>
<p>As much as I admire Anders and his generosity towards wanting
<br>
to save as many people as possible there are perhaps two problems.
<br>
First, at least at this time his concerns about getting on a plane or
<br>
opening his mail are significantly less than mine (so he can afford
<br>
to be generous).  Second, given what I presume he knows about the
<br>
strength of the programming of the brain during critical plasticity
<br>
periods (presumably being taken advantage of by the schools that are
<br>
&quot;brain washing&quot; young people with radical Islamic beliefs) can such
<br>
beliefs ever *really* be &quot;reversed&quot; (short of sending nanobots in to
<br>
undo the neural connections)?  While there is some fraction of people
<br>
on the list who demonstrate that neural &quot;foundations&quot; can be reversed
<br>
I do not believe we have any concrete data on the degree to which
<br>
this can be accomplished successfully.  If the numbers are 1 in 100
<br>
to 1 in 1000 then I would begin to consider that freezing (or executing)
<br>
brainwashed individuals is the optimal strategy until such time as
<br>
it is clear that defensive capabilities exceed the offensive leverage
<br>
of terrorists.  On the other hand if 1 in 10 are recoverable, then
<br>
it may make sense to proceed in a much more strategic fashion hoping
<br>
to imprison (defuse) such individuals until the technologies become
<br>
available to extract misconceived memes.
<br>
<p>There is no &quot;concrete&quot; evidence that the Extropian/transhumanist perspective
<br>
is &quot;correct&quot;.  We simply believe that we are.  This is no different from
<br>
the Muslim fundamentalist belief that their perspective is &quot;correct&quot;.
<br>
There are certainly many more of &quot;them&quot; than there are of &quot;us&quot;.  So
<br>
in terms of absolute numbers, we are clearly misguided.  We are misguided
<br>
not only from an Islamic fundamentalist perspective but most likely also
<br>
from a Christain or Jewish fundamentalist perspective.  So while we can
<br>
invoke the &quot;rationality&quot; perspective, I really question whether the
<br>
ground that concept stands on isn't quite swampy.  It was once rational
<br>
to consider the world was flat or that physical constants never change.
<br>
We know now the former is wrong and the later is up for serious challenge.
<br>
<p>I suspect there is little difference between the mental surgery that will
<br>
be required to excise improper beliefs from the brain states of millions
<br>
of individuals with &quot;misguided&quot; beliefs and executing them outright.
<br>
In both cases one will have to destroy the individual as they conceive
<br>
themselves in order to replace it with something more functional with
<br>
respect to the world as a whole or extropic principles.  There may be
<br>
a very big difference between individuals whose behaviors may be due
<br>
to complex genetic interactions that allow them to behave criminally
<br>
in an otherwise civilized environment (perhaps part of the violent
<br>
offender profile) and individuals whose entire foundation of beliefs
<br>
and the community in which they live is oriented towards the acceptence
<br>
of violent acts to eliminate any entities who disagree with their beliefs.
