<em>&gt; show up at the door
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Alcor with a week's notice of needing their services.  Would they be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to handle 10 of us?  20?  What if we had something infectious?  Would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we be turned away?  spike
</em><br>
<p>Might we conjecture that those infected with the cryo-Luddite meme that
<br>
prompts them to preserve past mistakes instead of moving on to new solutions
<br>
are the only ones who would _not_ be turned away. Would Metaman (the
<br>
superorganism of the evolutionary phase transition) freeze dead acorns instead
<br>
of sprouting oak saplings (metaphorically speaking). Or, IOW, does extropy
<br>
freeze dead caterpillars rather than encourage the metamorphosis of others
<br>
into butterflies? No, being an extropic entity, a self-organizing and
<br>
spontaneously ordered complex adaptive system (a global brain, as it were),
<br>
Metaman selects the most promising units of organic intelligence to assimilate
<br>
into more highly evolved cognizance. Call it the Triage of Artificial
<br>
Intelligence which precedes the approaching Singularity, because this is (as
<br>
you've pointed out) war.
<br>
Before we can plan a first line of defense, we need to know the enemy, and the
<br>
enemy is the whole ugly past of the human race, which has fought five thousand
<br>
wars in the last three thousand years. The enemy is that sick memeplex that
<br>
would suck transhumans/extropians back into the psycho-vortex of tribal
<br>
warfare. You want tracer ammo to shoot down poison duster aircraft. Well, OK,
<br>
that's not a bad idea if it results in defeating terrorism. But can it?
<br>
Recent events have induced many people to undertake a crash course (get it) in
<br>
Islam. My favorite Islamic sect is the Sufis, who are to Islam as Gnostics are
<br>
to Christianity, or as Chassid are to Judaism, or as zenjin are to Buddhism,
<br>
or as Yogis are to Hinduism, or as beatniks are to Taoism. What the Sufis call
<br>
Islam is comparable to what transhumanists call extropy. It is an organic
<br>
transformation, and the combination and flowering of intelligent energy which
<br>
can derive from any source including technology.
<br>
Sufis are called the people of the path, because their approach to life feels
<br>
like a long walk, a journey on which there is a single way to go, and a single
<br>
destination. That they are on the correct path they try to verify by their
<br>
sense of reality in the presence of their sages, whom they regard as
<br>
enlightened, which means that they have gone beyond words to cosmic knowledge.
<br>
But even without the sages, just remaining on the path is enough to bring them
<br>
to understanding. This approach looks like mystical nonsense to inexperienced
<br>
outsiders. Similarly, science looks like a religion to those who don't
<br>
understand how experimentation verifies observation.
<br>
The Sufi's first line of defense is revolutionary:
<br>
life is not a puzzle to solve; it's a mystery to enjoy.
<br>
The extropian's first line of defense is evolutionary: adapt or die.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
