<p>Well, this might be a tad harsh, but in THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION I
<br>
commented:
<br>
<p>========
<br>
<p>The flesh is notoriously weaker than the spirit, and even the spirit has
<br>
its own ways of going lethally haywire. Take a look at Bosnia or central
<br>
Africa. Psychoanalysis and the arts are eager to tell us about mixed or
<br>
hidden motives, most of them sexual one way or another. Evolutionary
<br>
psychology and medicine, though, are starting to show us how to track down
<br>
why and how these apparent aberrations are structured into life. These are
<br>
hard doctrines to accept, however brilliantly apt their explanations. Their
<br>
cynicism is extreme. Nothing sacred is left without its base account. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ape and essence
<br>
<p>At the extreme, we end up with a sort of vulgar gnosticism, embraced
<br>
recently by a former celebrity PR man turned would-be guru, Howard Bloom:
<br>
`The nature scientists uncover has crafted our viler impulses into us; in
<br>
fact, these impulses are a part of the process she uses to create. Lucifer
<br>
is the dark side of cosmic fecundity, the cutting blade of the sculptor's
<br>
knife. Nature does not abhor evil; she embraces it. She uses it to build.'
<br>
Oddly, even Bloom's defective version is less cynical than the mainstream
<br>
varieties deployed by Dawkins, Dennett, Robert Wright, Nesse and Williams.
<br>
These evolutionists stand by the individual, not the group, as nature's key. 
<br>
<p>=================
<br>
<p>The relevance of the last comment is that Bloom is an unashamed group
<br>
selectionist. Granted, there's a small place these days in evolutionary
<br>
theory for group selection, but not as much as Bloom would have us believe.
