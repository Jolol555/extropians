A question to Daniel UstOn Thursday, November 01, 2001 9:22 PM Smigrodzki,

Rafal <a href="mailto:SmigrodzkiR@MSX.UPMC.EDU?Subject=Re:%20A%20question%20to%20Daniel%20Ust&In-Reply-To=&lt;00b801c1635f$ca952720$1687ecd1@neptune&gt;">SmigrodzkiR@MSX.UPMC.EDU</a> wrote:

<em>&gt;Is there in your opinion any conceivable situation where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the economic interaction of free people, without fraud,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;third party&quot; intervention, direct coercion, but acting within
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a legal system respecting property rights, could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;undesirable consequences, necessitating a coercive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intervention on behalf of some of the persons involved?
</em><br>
<p>It could have undesirable consequences because the future is uncertain.
<br>
<p>Whether such conditions would necessitate &quot;coercive intervention&quot; is another
<br>
matter.  Wouldn't one want to err on the side of freedom and reason?
<br>
<p>Also, such coercion would have to meet the standard that it makes the
<br>
situation better and does not have other unintended consequences.  An
<br>
example of the latter would be where the initial intervention leads to
<br>
wreckless behavior on the economic actors in the future because now they
<br>
come to expect intervention to correct problems.  (This is kind of what has
<br>
happened with international bailouts in the 1990s.  Investors in the US came
<br>
to expect the IMF to bail out Mexico, the Asian tigers, and now Argentina.
<br>
This is perhaps not the best example, since it's arguable that the initial
<br>
interventions have, on their own, wreaked much havoc.)
<br>
<p>The lesson of history and economics is that government intervention does not
<br>
make the uncertainty less.  In fact, it tends to increase it.  Why so?  The
<br>
introduction of coercion into social relations lessens the need of parties
<br>
to work together and deal rationally with one another.  Coercion then
<br>
becomes a potential solution to any disagreement -- whether over prices,
<br>
wages, ownership, &quot;immoral&quot; but victimless behavior.  (This reflects the
<br>
situation of all societies right now.  People see government as a means to
<br>
bludgeon others into submission.  As Hoppe notes in _Democracy -- the God
<br>
that Failed_, government is a great decivilizing force.)
<br>
<p>This is from the socio-economic perspective.  From the psychological one, I
<br>
would expect initiated coercion, since it is basically antirational not to
<br>
work.  Surely, there will be stuff akin to the broken window fallacy --
<br>
where some gains are made, but the true costs are overlooked -- in the
<br>
mental sphere as well as the social one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Or is such situation in principle and in practice absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible and ruled out by the very foundations of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moral system?
</em><br>
<p>It's ruled out by my moral system, yes, but I am willing to entertain the
<br>
question from an economic and sociological perspective.  I aim to make my
<br>
moral system consistent with reality.  I basically agree with Rand's
<br>
Objectivism here, though I don't sheepishly follow all her pronouncements on
<br>
anything.  (See my site for some areas of disagreement.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I could imagine a few such situations, and I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weave a (hopefully) coherent web of inferences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and arguments, starting with the basics of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moral convictions and the knowledge I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the functioning of the world. I am very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;curious about your views here.
</em><br>
<p>I am equally curious to hear your &quot;inferences and arguments&quot; here.  (That
<br>
said, I'm busy searching for a job right now, so I might not be quick to
<br>
respond.  You might also want to look over my web site for more of my
<br>
views.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
