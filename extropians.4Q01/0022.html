<em>&gt; October 2001's _Scientific American_ has an article that consolidates on a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Life in a Hostile Universe&quot; by Guillermo Gonzalez, Donald Brownlee and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peter D. Ward.  (It's not online, but the issue contents are at

<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.sciam.com/2001/1001issue/1001quicksummary.html">http://www.sciam.com/2001/1001issue/1001quicksummary.html</a>)
</em><br>
<p>A preprint of a technical presentation on the same topic is at
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0103165">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0103165</a>.  We discussed this some time
<br>
ago I think but I have not read it recently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are few points they make, including that only certain conditions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right for forming earthlike planets, particle and electromagnetic radiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is too high in many of the places where they could be formed, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors in the galactic environment might make complex life less likely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only a narrow region of the galaxy has these conditions.  They call this the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ).
</em><br>
<p>The article actually suggested that some aspects of the GHZ concept make the
<br>
Fermi paradox worse:
<br>
<p>&quot;One of the arguments proposed to avoid that conclusion [i.e. that
<br>
extraterrestrial life should have been here already] is that ETs may
<br>
have no motivation to leave their home world and scatter signs of their
<br>
presence through space.  But if our ideas about the GHZ are correct,
<br>
we live within an especially comfortable region of the Milky Way.
<br>
Any civilization seeking a new world would, no doubt, place our solar
<br>
system on their home-shopping list.  The GHZ theory also weakens the
<br>
argument that the galaxy is so big that interstellar explorers or
<br>
colonizers have passed us by.  The GHZ may be large, but it is just a
<br>
part of the entire galaxy, and any galactic travelers would tend to roam
<br>
around the annulus rather than haphazardly through the galaxy.&quot;
<br>
<p>The explanatory power claimed for the GHZ with respect to the Paradox
<br>
is that it reduces the time frame in which life could have evolved.
<br>
Until the last few billion years the galaxy was supposedly much more
<br>
dangerous, with supernovas and an active nucleus.  Plus our Sun is
<br>
about 40 percent richer in heavy elements than most other stars formed
<br>
in the same place and time, making it more likely to develop a variety
<br>
of planets.  This suggests that the Solar System may be near-optimal
<br>
for the first development of complex life in the galaxy.
