<p>
My thoughts on Identity
<br>
<p>I am relatively new to this particular list so I had not seen this
<br>
discussion come up before.  I have thought some about this  and think it is
<br>
a very important issue to resolve.  From the perspective of the subject, say
<br>
me, in the event of a catastrophic  damage, I would never be aware of
<br>
awakening.  Assuming a real time constant backup is continually being made,
<br>
as was pointed out by kurzweill, the sentient being that awoke would have
<br>
all my thoughts and experiences and would have a continuity of
<br>
consciousness.  However, this sentient being is, by definition, a copy.  Is
<br>
an exact copy me?  I dont think so, I think its  just an exact copy *of* me.
<br>
This means that the original me does not ever perceive a waking up
<br>
sensation.  From the perspective  of an external observer this copy does
<br>
indeed appear to be me, since there is no objective test that can be used to
<br>
show that it is  not.  Or is there?  In reality, unless the copy of me is
<br>
identical at the quantum level, theoretically a test could be made to show
<br>
that this is not indeed the original me and is a copy.  There is no doubt in
<br>
my mind that this copy is a sentient being,  but there is a doubt in my mind
<br>
that it is *me*  Sure, my thoughts hopes dreams and fears and any
<br>
contribution I may bring to the world may live on in this copy, but I do not
<br>
wake up and live on.
<br>
<p>But then again, space-time does not exist at an interval any smaller than
<br>
the Planck length and all matter and energy  transversing space time travels
<br>
in small quantum leaps from one interval of space-time to the next, in
<br>
essence quantum  teleporting across these minuscule gaps in the fabric of
<br>
the universe.  If one were to imagine an atom that makes up a neuron in  the
<br>
human brain transversing space time, its small sub atomic components all
<br>
separately teleport randomly over short distances  in the general
<br>
macroscopic direction of motion, all of this teleporting averaging out at
<br>
the larger macroscopic level to lead to  a net motion of the atom, and,
<br>
subsequently the neuron that is made of groups of said atoms.  In effect,
<br>
all the components that  make up my brain, and me, are continually and
<br>
randomly teleporting all over the place, albeit very short distances.  It
<br>
could be  said then that traveling through time actually continually makes
<br>
'me' a copy of the me from the previous instant.  And if this  is the case,
<br>
the 'subjective' me always dies at every instant in time, which means I
<br>
guess I wouldn't have any issues with a  'copy' of me (as long as it is a
<br>
real time up to date one) coming should anything happen to this
<br>
physiological housing of this  incarnation of me.  But then again, all these
<br>
sub-microscopic quantum teleportation effects are not detectable outside of
<br>
the  atom, and consciousness is likely a phenomena routed in the pattern of
<br>
these microscope structures (patterns of atoms) and not  routed in some
<br>
quantum level effect (though some, such as Penrose, have argued that it is)
<br>
If consciousness does depend on a  quantum level effect, then these quantum
<br>
teleportations would definitely relate to consciousness.  If that were the
<br>
case, then  I would be satisfied that an up to date backup of me was
<br>
actually me, except that this quantum level teleportation effect does  not
<br>
apply to each particle simultaneously, instead different particles teleport
<br>
at different times.  When talking about  catastrophic damage to the
<br>
physiological host of me, that damage occurs to the whole system at once.
<br>
Since it is that system  that is me, then if it is damaged or destroyed,
<br>
then so I am...   But the random teleportation of particles only affects a
<br>
small number of particles at any one Planck instant in time.  So I do not
<br>
think those two effects could be considered similar.
<br>
<p>The macroscopic analogy of this would be replacing all neurons at the same
<br>
time with a copy of that neural pattern or replacing  one neuron at a time
<br>
over a great length of time.  These two effects would, I feel, be quite
<br>
different.  Is it still me if one  neuron is replaced with a synthetic
<br>
hardware neuron?  I think so, but what if I replace 10, 100, or 10^4 or 10^5
<br>
neurons?  At  what point do we have to start considering the possibility
<br>
that it is not me but a copy of me.  Surely if only one neuron were  *not*
<br>
replaced and the rest were with a copy, then that should be considered a
<br>
copy of me, as 1 neuron is not enough to house my  consciousness.  
<br>
<p>Should my neural net be slowly replaced one neuron at a time, I would not
<br>
consider this any loss to the continuity of  consciousness, and, at least
<br>
with my knowledge of the subject, I would consider this to indeed be *me*  
<br>
<p>Once my neural net is replaced by hardware though, an entirely different
<br>
scenario comes into play.  I think, in the short time I  have spent thinking
<br>
about this, that a sort of 'distributed processing' would be utilized, once
<br>
your neurons have been replaced  by a hardware version on neuron at a time,
<br>
a copy could be made of your neural net, also one neuron at a time, and your
<br>
neural  net could slowly start to communicate, one neuron at a time, with
<br>
this copy.  Thus distributing your consciousness over two  hardware copies,
<br>
without (in my opinion) having to worry about the loss of continuity of
<br>
consciousness.  This could be expanded  to multiple copies with your
<br>
consciousness randomly distributed across multiple copies of your original
<br>
neural net.  If this is  the case, and no one copy of your neural net houses
<br>
more than say... 5% of your total conscious processes then damage to any
<br>
one particular net will not result in your death while still maintaining
<br>
continuity of consciousness.
<br>
<p>In conclusion, I do not find any solace in a copy of me living on, even if
<br>
it is objectively identical to me, subjectively it is  not.  So, I think,
<br>
until the above scenario is achieved, I would opt for dearly protecting the
<br>
physiological mechanism currently  housing my consciousness.
<br>
<p>Just my 2c
<br>
