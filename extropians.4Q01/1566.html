<em>&gt; &gt; THe only thing that bothers me is that there are those who are so

<em>&gt; It is WRONG.  Do you belief for a minute that the precedent will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be applied to US citizens suspected of aiding and abetting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists? 
</em><br>
<p>The problem, Samantha, is that you are confusing these terrorists with
<br>
criminals of the civilian sort. They are NOT. They are prisoners of war,
<br>
and as such, can and should be interrogated. If a suspect is known and
<br>
documented to be an associate of a terrorist and fits the profile
<br>
themselves, they should be treated as such. This is not fighting crime,
<br>
this is fighting war. I understand that you have no experience in
<br>
dealing with the latter, so your ignorance is forgivable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Especially when what that label can be applied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is currently ultra-fuzzy? 
</em><br>
<p>There is nothing fuzzy about it, except maybe to someone with severe
<br>
ameriphobic myopia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How about a bit of torture of mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspects while we are about it?  Do you think it is open season
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on &quot;non-citizens&quot; just because of 9-11?  Would you like the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment when you go abroad? 
</em><br>
<p>Americans DO get that very treatment when we go abroad, even in
<br>
countries which are allegedly our freinds. The French, for example, are
<br>
particularly rough in interrogating suspects, and the Saudis as well
<br>
have been documented to have tortured and killed Americans.
<br>
<p>These terrorists attack us so willingly (rather than the regiemes which
<br>
they have their real beefs with) primarily because they know we are soft
<br>
and treat prisoners with kid gloves. One of the participants in the
<br>
Khobar Towers bombing, for example, was shipped to the US as a condition
<br>
of his agreement to testify against his accomplices, but as soon as he
<br>
got here he clammed up and refuses to talk, and our laws prevent us from
<br>
shipping him back to Saudi Arabia where they are quite willing to make
<br>
him talk.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you like this treatment on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere suspicion without legal counsel?  The day that the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government uses such methods is the day it becomes my sworn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemy.
</em><br>
<p>Well, from what I've seen from you, that doesn't scare me much. You
<br>
gonna bomb me with flowers and hugs? Or are you going to temporarily
<br>
adopt tactics in extremis that you would normally abhor in order to deal
<br>
with an outside threat that exploits your preferred way of life?
