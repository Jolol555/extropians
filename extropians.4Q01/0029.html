I thought the article was very weak.  While it may be true
<br>
that we currently live in the &quot;habitable zone&quot; it doesn't
<br>
make a good case as to why it is impossible that an advanced
<br>
technological civilization could not have evolved a few
<br>
hundred million to a billion years earlier than us somewhat
<br>
closer to the galactic center (where the metalicity is higher).
<br>
<p>Articles like this always cite the radiation hazard, but any
<br>
radiation level below that which vaporizes the oceans of
<br>
a planet is somewhat suspect IMO.  We know from Deinococcus
<br>
radiodurans that it is perfectly feasible to evolve life
<br>
forms that have *much* more robust radiation tolerance than that
<br>
the average species on this planet has.  A reasonable argument can
<br>
also be made that higher radiation levels and/or cometary
<br>
impacts would actually accelerate evolution.  Yes, you can
<br>
get to the point where you keep reducing life to dust faster
<br>
than it can complexify but we have no good feel for whether
<br>
we are in the middle of the galactic hazard function or
<br>
either end of the distrubtion.
<br>
<p>Finally, it contains no discussion of what happens if technological
<br>
civilizations evolve to our stage and beyond (through the singularity).
<br>
The Fermi Paradox rests on the assumption that travel and/or colonization
<br>
by life forms like us is a worthwhile persuit.  I'd argue that
<br>
civilizations capable of interstellar travel are going to be much
<br>
more interested in &quot;harvesting&quot; brown dwarfs or dense molecular
<br>
gas clouds than planets like Earth.  But we have been over all
<br>
of this ground before so it probably isn't worth the bandwidth.
