<p>
well Emlyn has 2 good points... how do you carry anything and what about 
<br>
rain, but there are other implications also.
<br>
<p>I think that until there is an infrastructure in place (special lanes on 
<br>
sidewalks for example) that will support this device, it will be banned from 
<br>
sidewalks just like skateboards and scooters are in many cities. I can also 
<br>
imagine that safety while riding the thing is going to be a huge issue. 
<br>
Self-balancing or not, I would still want to be strapped in or something if I 
<br>
am zooming down a road at 30 miles per hour! Helmet and pads would have to be 
<br>
required I would think... which might look funny on a postal worker! 
<br>
The picture from Time doesn't show the top of the device either... I want to 
<br>
see how it is steered, and if you even have to hold on at all.
<br>
I would love to see the performance specs on the thing... stuff like ground 
<br>
clearance (HMMM I wonder if you can put all-terrain knobby tires on it???), 
<br>
turning radius, maximum incline allowed, top speed, etc. Imagine what all the 
<br>
pro skateboarders/rollerbladers would do with this thing too hahaa!
<br>
<p>One last thing... is there a sidecar attachment??? :P
<br>
