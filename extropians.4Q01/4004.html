<p>Not really. Modern homes are extremely energy efficient. They are so
<br>
airtight that many such homes need CO and radon detectors to warn of
<br>
dangerous buildups of these gasses, and their R values are extremely
<br>
high. That is not to say that there is a lot of older housing that could
<br>
use help, but since 1980, the average US home has doubled its efficiency
<br>
with the help of retrofits of insulation, lighting, HVAC, window
<br>
replacements (gone from single pane to triple pane with glazings).
<br>
<p>The market decides what efficiency gains are appropriate. If you spend
<br>
more money on an efficiency gain than it is worth, you actually wind up
<br>
wasting more energy as a result (money = energy).
<br>
<p>As seen in the energy markets of late, the recent high oil prices are an
<br>
entirely fictitious construction of a monopolizing syndicate with a
<br>
political agenda. Now that Russia has become a more effective supplier,
<br>
it is mitigating the influence of OPEC in the market, and so the era of
<br>
artificially inflated energy prices may well be over. I would predict
<br>
that the price of oil will not go over $26 pbbl for another decade, if
<br>
not two decades or more.
<br>
<p>The mass marketing of hybrid automobiles will be the most significant
<br>
change in consumer efficiency for the next decade. Next will be the
<br>
application of fuel cell technologies to home heating and energy supply.
<br>
Then, as nanoassembly techniques become commonplace, the whole lighting
<br>
infrastructure will be replaced with electroluminescent technology, as
<br>
nano assembly is needed to overcome the arc stability problems that
<br>
technology has at high brightness and large surface areas.
<br>
<p>These changes will cause oil consumption to drop by another 50% over the
<br>
next 10-20 years (unless, of course, that much more of the human race
<br>
develops a modern western industrial infrastructure, a distinct
<br>
possibility) and thus prices will remain relatively stable, if not drop
<br>
to permanent prices in the $10-20 / bbl range.
<br>
<p>The next huge change will be the development of CO2 dessicant
<br>
technologies using nanoreplication biospheres. This will start with
<br>
brute force seeding of oceanic plankton (which has the added benefit of
<br>
boosting the human food supply as well)
