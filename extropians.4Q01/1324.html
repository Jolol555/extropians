Here is an interesting article by an Antropology professor at Rutgers:
<br>
<p>&quot;Rogue males&quot;
<br>
Lionel Tiger
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4268153,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4268153,00.html</a>
<br>
<p>It points out one of the fundamental problems the hording of women
<br>
by the Islamic wealthy so the young poor men have few alternatives but to
<br>
go to war.  Not that I'm against &quot;Islam&quot; per se, but this is a fundamental
<br>
problem that is built into the religion (like any priciples against interest)
<br>
Antropologists believe that lack of food or mates are the only two things
<br>
that can sufficiently motivate men to &quot;go to war&quot;.
<br>
<p>Excerpts:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will the situation change? There are countless young men in poor &quot;states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of concern&quot; whose only plausible luxury may lie in the symbolic realm of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral and theological triumph. They are likely, at best, to have to scrape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a minimally tolerable existence that pales beside the images of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensual and material peril - America! America! - their leaders seek to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hide from them but cannot. &quot;The Great Satan&quot; strictly translated is &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great tempter&quot;. A select few, perhaps the most angry or lonely, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most pious or theoretical, will decide not to try to become part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America or its way of life but to destroy it.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; American and other forces will have to find, confront, and destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something new. They may well succeed in rooting out at least the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overt groups. But the much larger and longer-term problem for us and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world at large - that there are millions upon millions of these young men,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not just Bin Laden's thousands - will finally have to be faced by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently feckless leaders of the grim societies that have produced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nurtured such wild theological pathologies.
</em><br>
<p>And here is an article that suggests we are partially in our current boat
<br>
because we have failed to follow 20 year old recomendations about reducing
<br>
our dependence on foreign oil.

<br>
<p>Again, Samantha, worth your time to read as the article points out that
<br>
bin Laden *pays* the families of individuals who commit suicide for his
<br>
agenda.  This is a form of group selection since the genes shared by
<br>
those committing terrorist attacks will more likely be propagated
<br>
due to the increased wealth of family members.  Over time this will
<br>
result in a population of individuals increasingly willing to sacrifice
<br>
themselves for idealogical causes.
<br>
<p>And a commentary on the need for &quot;mimetic&quot; engineering:

<br>
<p>The only thing I tought a bit far-fetched was this quote:
<br>
<em>&gt; nanomachines that can invade the circulatory system and effect the brain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought patterns of the target
</em><br>
<p>Not anytime in the near future....
<br>
<p>In response to Samantha's question regarding &quot;fatwas&quot;, a &quot;fatwa&quot; is
<br>
a religious ruling by someone with &quot;authority&quot;.  The problem with
<br>
Islam, and many other religions with the possible exceptions of
<br>
Buddhism and Catholicism, is that there is no &quot;supreme authority&quot;.
<br>
Islam, like evangelical christianity, seems to have a book which
<br>
can be interpreted in many different ways.  So &quot;fatwas&quot; can
<br>
go many ways from &quot;Islam is a peaceful religion&quot; to &quot;Killing
<br>
infidels in the name of Allah is what Islamics should do&quot;.
