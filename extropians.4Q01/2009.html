</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What is &quot;supposed to be about terrorism&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If we are attempting to find solutions to terrorism then it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;important to understand where it comes from and why.  If part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the why is the grievances various countries and entities have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;against US policies then the question comes up as to whether any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of those grievances have merit and whether we are in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sometimes acting in oppressive manner in other countries and what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we might do to change that if so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are not looking for the solution to terrorism at the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, we are looking for the terrorists who committed a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act and their supporters. We are out to destroy them.
</em><br>
<p>That is contrary to what Bush is claiming about this war.  We
<br>
are out to end terrorism from what I have heard him say.  We are
<br>
not out only against the particular ones who carried out the
<br>
9/11 attacks but all terrorists.  
<br>
<p>If we are not looking for a solution then this is just about
<br>
vengeance.  It is not even about protecting ourselves from
<br>
further terrorism or, to the extent possible, making terrorism
<br>
less likely in the world.  Why should we have an unlimited and
<br>
unbounded committment to only that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reasons they hate us are many, largely it seems because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are taught lies in Pakistani maddrasas, and are broadcast bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lies via Al-Jazeera television.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>This is utterly simplistic.  To say that all who are angry with
<br>
us are dupes and liars is surely obviously biased and unlikely
<br>
to be accurate.  For one thing it denies real events that have
<br>
angered many in that part of the world.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If it makes sense to agree to an open-ended &quot;war&quot; to root out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;all actual terrorists from anywhere and everywhere then surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it also makes sense to understand the roots and to work to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;lessen the seeds of future terrorism where/if we can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good idea, close the maddrassas, shut down Al-Jazeera....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The Al-Jazeera is one of the few relatively independent voices
<br>
in the area.  I thought we are supposed to be for a free press. 
<br>
Or does that only apply in America and other rules apply
<br>
anywhere else if they say unpleasant things about us?  I thought
<br>
we believe in free speech.  Only here?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I don't see how the &quot;that alone&quot; makes any sense at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Especially when our government is certainly not after &quot;that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;alone&quot; but after finding and neutralizing all terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;everywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are out to end this sort of thing on a permanent basis. We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sending a clear message: &quot;being a terrorist will get you hunted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down and killed, find another way to express your frustrations.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is not the way to end terrorism.  It will not work and
<br>
never has worked throughout history.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Al-Jareeza happens to be the most independent and competent news
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;source in the Mid East.  That some of its writers may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;espoused an alternate theory does not mean they are incompetent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;nincompoops.  Especially when the biases in other reports from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more &quot;mainstream&quot; sources have also been quite evident.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Find me one piece of evidence that indicates the Israelis are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for Sept 11, and I will retract my opinion about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculous Islamic tabloid known as Al-Jazeera.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your opinion based on one set of editorials is irrelevant. 
<br>
Whether there is evidence of Israeli involvement or not is not
<br>
the issue.  You are advocating blaming a particular publication
<br>
and shutting it down although it is not remotely any of our
<br>
business to do any such thing and such attitudes and acting on
<br>
them are part of what pisses many off toward the US.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In point of fact, we do not know who was behind the attack yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;We have strong suspicion of it being bin Laden.  But I haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;seen anything really strong enough to convict in an open court
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may not have seen anything that convinces you, but I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced long ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Then present your evidence if you would.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If I was to become a terrorist you would never find sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence to convict me in any court.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But that is hardly an argument that you did or did not commit
<br>
any act is it?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;To what end?  What are your objectives?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Destroy Bin Laden/Al-Quaeda, destroy their Taliban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporters/allies, re-establish a viable government (democratic)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the people of Afghanistan, get out and go home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK.  That is at least much more modest than what Bush and co.
<br>
are proposing.  Getting bin Laden and changing the Afghani
<br>
government are only the beginning for them.  On what basis will
<br>
you destroy the Taliban rather than simply deposing their
<br>
government?  I don't see any righteous basis for us fully
<br>
destroying them.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Why is crushing Kandahar a big objective?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taliban stronghold, see above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK. But I don't understand your above goal.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I agree on bringing in UN peacekeepers and bringing in aid before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;winter comes on 100%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm glad we agree on this. I think the war should proceed with all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fury to shorten it to the minimal possible time to achieve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objectives. Every day we delay, innocent people suffer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Destroying the Taliban utterly would cause a lot of innocent
<br>
suffering also.  As the Al-Qaeda is supposed to span multiple
<br>
countries destroying it would not end at Afghanistan either.  So
<br>
where else would you see us march in for a military action?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This is the reason I think we should have taken major centers like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kabul and Mazer-el-Sharif by now, to establish within the country,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and out of Taliban control, safe zones for the people of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan. By releasing these centers immediatly to U.N. control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we demonstrate we have no intention of staying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the aftermath will be disappointing. I wouldn't support a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government for Afghanistan that didn't include things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal suffrage, try selling that in an Islamic country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Dunno.  Doesn't it already exist in Egypt and Jordan or some of
<br>
the countries in the area that are largely Muslim?  I am
<br>
admittedly ignorant here.  I think there might be a real swing
<br>
away from theocratic state in Afghanistan after their experience
<br>
under the Taliban.
