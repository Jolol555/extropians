<p>This is such a common sense position, I don't see why it would be

controversial -- were it not for technophobes who expect technology to

be either perfect or completely evil.

<p>I think the real problem with the late 1990s Boom was not so much that
<br>
people went uncritical forward with technological innovation -- but
<br>
really how technologically innovative is it to sell pet food online
<br>
below cost?:) -- but that other people were willing to disregard things
<br>
like ROI and profits to give other people money to do this.  Why did
<br>
this happen?  The Alan Greenspan/Paul Krugman explanation seems to be
<br>
very Keynesian: human irrationality took over.  This doesn't explain
<br>
anything.  Why did irrationality take over then and not sooner or later?
<br>
Instead, the answer lies in the inflationary and regulatory policies
<br>
pursued during that period.  These policies setup a context in which
<br>
people would react to market signals that would lead them to have ever
<br>
more inconsistent intertemporal plans.  (In other words, a properly
<br>
functioning market -- one without such distortions -- would lead to plan
<br>
coordination -- with some errors as always, since the future is always
<br>
uncertain.  A distorted market inhibits this and sends investments in
<br>
the wrong direction by changing the risks and price signals.)

<p>&quot;The relative price effects associated with inflation affect monetary
<br>
calculation in a number of related ways.  All of these problems involve
<br>
increased epistemological burdens on market actors.  Because changes in
<br>
the structure of of relative prices now arise from both 'real' side
<br>
changes in preferences [i.e., what consumers really want and can demand
<br>
on the market] and opportunity costs and 'money' side changes related to
<br>
the inflation process, entrepreneurs who wish to form expectations about
<br>
future prices must account for not only the market behavior they have
<br>
always had to, but also for the effects of inflation.&quot; -- Stephen
