</em><br>
<p>Eli, they refer to you as the Bearded One.  {8^D  They already
<br>
figured out that the Bearded One was leading the prayers
<br>
to Hakosot.
<br>
<p>Explanation needed.  In the Silicon Valley, land was once wasted
<br>
growing trees and crops.  Consequently it was practically worthless.
<br>
When Hewlett and Packard came along, they started building actual
<br>
industry, and the price of land steadily increased, from zero to
<br>
its current ridiculous value.  Consequently, you will find older
<br>
neighborhoods built on some of the very best land, crummy old
<br>
houses on big lots, since there was no need to crowd them.  As
<br>
Bill and Dave's vision became reality, there were more houses
<br>
built ever closer together on ever more expensive land.
<br>
<p>So you get the following ironic sitch: older neighborhoods with
<br>
widely spaced tiny two bedroom one bath tract shacks, each
<br>
often inhabited by half a dozen or more proles, as opposed to
<br>
newer neighborhoods, relatively roomy four bedroom three bath
<br>
tract shacks crammed together 12 to the acre, built on crummy
<br>
land that no one else wanted, such as the flood plane my house
<br>
is on, most of which are, like mine, inhabited by exactly two
<br>
proles.
<br>
<p>All 29 houses in my neighborhood are on 2.4 acres of
<br>
flood-prone land, the entire tract smaller than Mike
<br>
Lorrey's back yard alone {according to my low flying
<br>
surveillance equipment}.
<br>
<p>My own tiny back yard is directly visible from the second
<br>
floor of at least six of my neighbor's houses, thus their
<br>
comments about the Bearded One leading prayers to
<br>
the Savior Hakosot.
<br>
<p>The joys of city life!  Doesnt it make you want to join
<br>
the seething masses crowding into the Silicon Valley?  spike
