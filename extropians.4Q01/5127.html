&quot;humanities&quot; classes at universities I have attended were being

led by people who had read less in the field[s] than I had, it

seemed a distinct waste of time to me.  Of course I didn't go to
<br>
college until many years after high school, when I was as
<br>
&quot;well-rounded&quot; as I ever intended to be.
