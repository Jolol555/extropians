<em>&gt; Mike:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a remarkable statement. Can you clarify? Are you implying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the ACLU has been effective in limiting certain liberties (gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership?) that would have directly lead to the saving of 1000s of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives? Or are you saying that as a consequence of supporting certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil liberties 1000s of people have died (i.e., by supporting free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech on the internet bad people have been allowed to hurt good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones)? Did they dramatically increase the chances of the 9-11?? Can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you detail in a paragraph the exact atrocities that this evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization has perpetrated. What are the names of the dead?
</em><br>
<p>When you are dealing with statistical probabilities, you can't name the
<br>
dead specifically, because some of them would have died anyways.
<br>
However, it is a proven fact that for every 1% increase in the law
<br>
abiding population carrying concealed weapons, violent crime rates drop
<br>
by 2%. It therefore follows that when the ACLU lobbies for gun control
<br>
laws which limit the ability of x% of law abiding citizens to carry
<br>
concealed weapons, they are helping to kill y% more people via violent
<br>
crime.
<br>
<p>Additionally, since it is also a proven fact that 90% of crime is
<br>
committed by less than 2% of the population, that most crime is caused
<br>
by repeat offenders. When the ACLU helps to release a person who did, in
<br>
fact, commit a crime, due to some legalistic technicality, they are
<br>
directly responsible for the ability of that criminal to commit more
<br>
repeat offenses, and the ensuing generation of victims of those crimes.
<br>
<p>Similarly, when the ACLU defends the rights of organizations dedicated
<br>
to stripping civil rights from members of some race, creed, gender, or
<br>
ethnic group, they assist in the continued viability of those
<br>
organizations, and also lend such groups a legitimacy with some members
<br>
of the population they would not have otherwise had.
<br>
<p>This is all fact which cannot be disputed. What we as a free people need
<br>
to accept is that a) with freedom for all individuals, this places the
<br>
onus on the individual to choose to act in a trustworthy manner or not,
<br>
and b) we should not deny that having these freedoms does in fact create
<br>
a 'blind spot' that those who are untrustworthy can exploit to cause
<br>
harm and misery. The problem we as a society face, if we are insistent
<br>
on keeping our freedoms for all, is, if we do not want to remain at high
<br>
risk of criminal attack, to create some means of filtering out
<br>
individuals who are not trustworthy enough to participate in our open
<br>
society.
<br>
<p>The standard of filtration which was adopted when the Constitution was
<br>
written was that 'all are innocent until proven guilty'. This has,
<br>
unfortunately, been eroded by the forces of moral and social relativity
<br>
over the past century or so, such that being proven guilty does not
<br>
necessarily make one so untrustworthy that they are unable to continue
<br>
to exploit our societal blind spots. While the principles of redemption
<br>
and rehabilitation do run through our society, they should not be
<br>
assumed as a default characteristic of all prisoners upon release from
<br>
prison. Prison does not rehabilitate, nor are all prisoners able or
<br>
willing to be rehabilitated.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the 'innocent until proven guilty' standard cannot apply to
<br>
individuals immigrating. Those wishing to travel to our open society
<br>
from societies with much lower standards of trust must be held up to a
<br>
higher standard of behavior, because, as we have seen, the worst such
<br>
societies do not generally cooperate with our immigration authorities in
<br>
determining who is trustworthy or not (especially in the case of
<br>
individuals who are members of state sponsored terrorist groups).
<br>
<p>The facts are that the ACLU has worked for decades to tear down these
<br>
standards of filtration which our open society needs to maintain high
<br>
trust institutions and interrelations between individuals. They seek to
<br>
make us into a third world, low trust society of aristocrats and serfs,
<br>
where the most powerful aristocrats are the lawyers, who gain their
<br>
power from selling 'rights' to the highest bidder (be that an individual
<br>
bidder, or a special interest group).
