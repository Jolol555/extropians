<p><em>&gt;&quot;Let the Afghans tell you&quot;? Which Afghans, specifically?
</em><br>
<p>Same answer.
<br>
<p>Let them tell you. The Afghans are a fiercely independent, proud
<br>
people, with a rich history going back centuries, with deep inner
<br>
lives, with the last one or two hundred years tied strongly to their
<br>
land. The binding of that culture is their language and a
<br>
combination of the above. *They* know what is good for them, not
<br>
outsiders. The proposal that I heard yesterday of going with troups to
<br>
_their_ country and &quot;rebuilding&quot; (????) into a &quot;new Afghanistan&quot; made
<br>
me turn white. I didn't sleep well last night and the last nights
<br>
with what I'm hearing here and what I know regarding the war outside
<br>
my home.
<br>
<p>It's not unusual to have splits or huge philsophical/religious
<br>
differences between a group of people who share the same language
<br>
within the same country's borders. In Germany, there are so many
<br>
variations (dialects) of the language, that the Northern Germans
<br>
even have difficulty  understanding the Southern Germans and vice
<br>
versa. East and West are still communicating poorly, and with some
<br>
bitterness.  The differences exist and you work with it, finding the
<br>
commonalities to communicate, and so that is what is done here,
<br>
sometimes successfully, sometimes not successfully between all of
<br>
the different ethnic groups, peoples, nations, religions.
<br>
<p>The Europeans could learn alot from the Americans about how to &quot;work
<br>
together&quot;, and the Americans could learn alot from the Europeans
<br>
about how to respect and care about enormous differences.
<br>
<p>Right now the Afghans are really hungry and really angry. They've
<br>
had to fight two superpowers for 20 years who have devasted,
<br>
manipulated, meddled to an unbelievable degree. Now the extremists of
<br>
that culture are in power and I am not surprised about that.
<br>
<p>Amara
<br>
<p>P.S. I'm a lot closer to Afghanistan than you are, and I'm an American.
