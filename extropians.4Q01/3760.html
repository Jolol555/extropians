<em>&gt; Specifically, I'm interested in if extropians view the dominant advances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in music's immediate evolution as coming from theoretical models (much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way composers like Schoenberg and others radicalized the &quot;serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music&quot; world during the turn of the last century) or from technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances (much the way Ray Kurzweil's K-250 and digital recording
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakthroughs did at the end of the last century). Or will it possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a &quot;hard&quot; combination of the two (like the &quot;chaos&quot; composition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generators &amp; granular synths of today)?
</em><br>
<p><p>My personal opinion is that at this point improvements in technology have
<br>
very little impact on what is possible musically.  I think people are
<br>
extremely hard pressed to do anything &quot;new&quot; in the sound department, and
<br>
what can be aesthetically constructed is a very tiny subset of the space of
<br>
possibilities in any given context.  I guess what I am saying is that
<br>
regardless of the construction process, the results are unlikely to be
<br>
&quot;new&quot;.
<br>
<p>With specific regard to chaotic and granular synthesis, I don't think these
<br>
will ever be anything other than a minor curiosity for two reasons.  First,
<br>
it is intrinsically difficult for the artist to control the sound with these
<br>
methods, which makes for a very poor canvas for the artist to express
<br>
themselves.  Second, the entire spectrum of textures and sounds can be
<br>
created using synthesis methods that are far more artist friendly (i.e.
<br>
sample playback, subtractive, additive, frequency modulation, wave table,
<br>
phase distortion, physical modeling, vector, etc and any combination thereof
<br>
with a healthy dose of modulation routings for good measure).  The advent of
<br>
&quot;Swiss Army Knife&quot; DSP based semi-modular synthesis systems allow sound
<br>
designers to pretty much get any result they want using some combination of
<br>
&quot;artist friendly&quot; synthesis algorithms.  Granular synthesis is interesting,
<br>
but most useful results it generates could have been generated by other
<br>
forms of synthesis with a lot less effort and far more control.
<br>
<p>Of course, this is just my opinion.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
