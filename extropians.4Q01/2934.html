<p>The rest of the world's governments don't have the power to resist
<br>
the actions of the U.S. government, and these other governments
<br>
are already acting to restrict more our freedoms.
<br>
<p>Germany used to have very strong laws (with some exceptions, see
<br>
below) for protection of privacy. Now legal wiretapping, in the
<br>
interest of &quot;The war against terrorism&quot; is under serious discussion
<br>
here, and will probably be passed into a new law.
<br>
<p>Some trivia:
<br>
<p>Many years ago at the Munich Olympics and following, there were a
<br>
number of terrorist actions, and the German government initiated a
<br>
new law to &quot;register&quot; people, in the interest of &quot;tracking
<br>
terrorists&quot;. This law applies to all people, not only to foreigners
<br>
like me. So if a German citizen wants to move one floor down in an
<br>
apartment building, for example, they would be breaking the law if
<br>
they didn't register their new address within a short period of time.
<br>
<p>Did it help &quot;track terrorists&quot; then? Does it now? People here can
<br>
figure out the answer quick enough, and see the high price
<br>
that a nebulous goal of &quot;tracking terrorists&quot; costs.
<br>
<p>Ciao (I'm off for a while),
