<em>&gt; This is a blatant attack on the foundations of trust that keep our

<em>&gt; This cannot happen while we remain open to attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Then you have a huge problem because there is no such thing as
<br>
limited repression leading to being totally impervious to
<br>
attack.  There will always be the possibility of attack. 
<br>
Freedom cannot be contingent on removing what will always be
<br>
with us.  The best that can be done is to reduce the reasons for
<br>
attack,  increase the ability to detect and defend consistent
<br>
with freedom,  increase the costliness of such attacks and
<br>
create other mechanisms for dealing with problems than violence
<br>
and counter-violence wherever possible.

<p><em>&gt; This week, we see that our airliners are still no safer, other than that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passengers are less willing to accept such behavior. Reid was able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smuggle a bomb of C-4 onto the plane, despite being extensively checked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by French authorities and refused entry to a plane once already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Now that is pretty ridiculous, I agree.  With all of our
<br>
technology we should be able to detect a bit better than this. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The problem we face here is that we now have a far larger and diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society with larger tensions - suddenly everything is global, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neighbour is a gay zoroastrian sociologist and the smallpox genome can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be found on the Internet. Solutions trying to fix things by making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world a smaller place (isolationism) are practiclly unworkable (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefits are enormous), as are attempts to put genies back in bottles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (relinquishment). Attempts to make people less diverse are not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethically questionable and impractical, they also tend to breed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resistance that produces just the kind of nasty backlashes we have come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to fear. Hence any solution has to deal with strengthening those webs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. Part of this is mechanisms to better filter out those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untrustworthies who have infiltrated the webs of trust. As a chain is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong as its weakest link, the solution is to check each and every link
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for integrity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And how will you do this without also greatly restricting
<br>
freedom and putting those minorities who think more like you or
<br>
I at considerable risk of repression or worse?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think the NYT article makes a mistake by suggesting the choice is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between a less open society (artificial trust established by having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; special trusted part - the government - being given all the power), a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more controlled world (which seems to imply the same thing, but now on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; global scale) or higher risk. The naked airlines idea really shows a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out: a bit of lateral thinking mixing a technical solution with a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If the west has exported hightech but not the social fabrics necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to use it reasonably safely, we better find ways of packaging social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fabric with the hightech (maybe as packing material?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it also depends on the method of application. For instance, take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face recognition technology. Does a FRT device need to have a database
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ALL individuals? No, it only needs a database of those whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trustworthiness has been limited in some way, much as the Insta-check
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system for firearms purchase only contains names of those who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prohibited from purchasing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but then your face or mine can be added at any time for any
<br>
reason whatsoever no matter how much the government &quot;shouldn't&quot;
<br>
be hassling us.  Of course, these systems will be used.  But
<br>
they should be avaialable and used by civilians as well as
<br>
government if there is to be any checks and balances.  We need
<br>
to spy on them as much and more than they spy on us.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Should a non-citizen have the same trustworthiness as a non-citizen?
</em><br>
<p>In some things, yes.  Although &quot;trustworthiness&quot; prejudices
<br>
fundamental human rights discussions by artificially delimiting
<br>
what is being talked about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's rather obvious that a citizen will be more well known by a society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a non-citizen of that society. Using the above formula for citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that crime records only record the reputations of criminals, not of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law abiding citizens, a criminal citizen would have a more thorough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputation with a society than a person who has never violated a law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who is therefore more trustworthy?
</em><br>
<p>There is no person in the entire country who has never violated
<br>
a law.  The issue of trust while preserving freedom is very
<br>
complex.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is why reputation brokers like credit agencies use a flawed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methodology with citizens, because they automatically assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone with no reputation is implicity untrustworthy. When you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with non-citizens, this may be applicable, but not with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the person is an unknown even if a citizen in such
<br>
circumstances.  So, in fact, I should not trust them with things
<br>
requiring a high degree of trust without adquate safeguards in
<br>
place.  That the person happened to be born in my country is no
<br>
guarantee at all.
