<em>&gt; &gt;     &gt; From where I sit the US is quite interested in a war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's ridiculous, there is no reason America would want any war right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now, much less a &quot;major and  indefinite&quot; one. Do you think Americans just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; woke up one fine day and thought &quot; You know what I'd really like, I'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rule the poorest country in the world, Afghanistan&quot;? It's not complicated, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need to look for hidden motives, we are at war because somebody is trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to kill us and they've already made a very good start.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then tell me exactly why we are talking about an indeterminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war against an unknown number of targets in an unknown number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries.  Such a war should be shouted down immediately.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it isn't.  Why?  As bad as 911 was such a response is overboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and overly broad.
</em><br>
<p>Too bad. The problem is not in our response, it is in their behavior.
<br>
They refuse to act according to the laws of war, which were set up to
<br>
allow civilian populations to remain as free and unfettered as possible
<br>
from the inhumanities of war. Fascists all through the 20th century
<br>
worked hard to erode those laws as much as possible, and the current day
<br>
terrorists are doing the same. They don't wear uniforms, declare no
<br>
allegiance to any nation or official army, attack unarmed civilians, and
<br>
do not use recognised military weapons.
<br>
<p>This is the worst possible behavior, because it is an attack on the very
<br>
trust foundations of our society. We cannot go blindly on insisting they
<br>
are still there when they have crumpled as assuredly as the towers in
<br>
New York did. Therefore, to insist upon behavior that depends on all
<br>
parties acting in a trust worthy manner is pollyannish behavior of the
<br>
most excessive sort. It is tantamount to a Titanic passenger demanding
<br>
room service when everyone else is in the lifeboats and jumping
<br>
overboard.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;     &gt;Are you utterly sure some elements of your own  country are not planting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     &gt;just enough anthrax to create a scare and justify going after the next target?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Right, and flying saucer crashed in New Mexico 50 years ago and there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bodies of aliens in a freezer at a Air Force base, and we learned how to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; microprocessors from the debris of that crash, and JFK is still alive, Elvis too,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and CIA satellites are beaming thoughts into my head, and black helicopters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are chasing me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laugh if you want to but it is a much more complicated world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than blase assumptions that we are the good guys and those are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;evil ones&quot; would lead you to believe.
</em><br>
<p>Typically people who claim that the world is this complicated are those
<br>
who need to make excuses about why they continue to do nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;     &gt;Our campaign is massively dishonest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Interesting, one side crashed two civilian jetliners into the two largest civilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; office buildings in the world, the same side sends letters laced with anthrax to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; innocent people, the same side makes it a crime to educate women,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but that's not the side you call &quot;massively dishonest&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We do not know there is any terrorism plot behind the anthrax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scare according to experts.  Nor do we have evidence saying it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is done by any particular group that is more than extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flimsy.  That the Taliban are nasty folks does not say they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for all ills nor that an endless campaign that goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially beyond Afghanistan is in the least justified.  Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mention the eviscerating of our own civil liberties.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it is bin Laden's MO that he doesn't claim responsibility for his
<br>
acts outside of releasing videotapes a few days or weeks before hand
<br>
talking about how his enemies will suffer the consequences. Since nobody
<br>
else is stepping up to the plate, that is a pretty good indicator. The
<br>
three locations where letters have been tracked to: Boca Raton, Newark,
<br>
and Malaysia, have known populations of islamic radicals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      &gt;and  ill-defined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would say American foreign policy has not been better defined in my lifetime,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's do what you have to do in order to stay alive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is not what we are doing exactly.
</em><br>
<p>It's fairly simple, Samantha, so try to follow along: Terrorists don't
<br>
follow the laws of war. The Laws of War help protect the foundations of
<br>
our high trust society. Therefore we pound to dust anyone who practices
<br>
terrorism.
