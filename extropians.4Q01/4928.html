</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of landminds and other unexploded ordinance in Afghanistan.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US has consistently refused to sign landmine treaties and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; produces much of the landmines in the world.  Laos and Cambodia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are also to this day suffering from landmines and various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unexploded ordinance from the Vietnam war.  The US still refuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to share much of its data about how specific devices from that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; era work with those attempting to find and defuse the landmines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the closest thing to an expert on landmine warfare on this list (in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likelihood at least), the above paragraph is so full of invalid assumptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it can effectively be discarded.  Very few people who have opinions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this topic know anything about the doctrine, technology, and deployment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landmines in warfare.  To try to paint the US as a bad guy on the topic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landmines suggests great ignorance of some fundamental history and facts on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this subject.
</em><br>
<p>Nor do I care to.  Blowing body parts off of civilians for
<br>
decades after original deployment can not be excused by any
<br>
amount of &quot;expertise&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First of all, landmines have very legitimate and essentially irreplaceable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uses in conventional land warfare.  Furthermore, they are almost purely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defensive weapons.  Almost all the arguments against landmine warfare do not
</em><br>
<p>How so when the go bang for many many years afterwards and
<br>
against people who you then have nearly offensive of defensive
<br>
grievances with?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; apply to the US military, though most people assume this is the case.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary purpose of landmines is to impede an offensive action, giving time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the defenders to launch a defense and/or counterassault.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly useful when the defenders expect to be badly outnumbered.
</em><br>
<p>Fine, if you clear all the ordinance out afterward.  Otherwise,
<br>
not fine at all.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Because the US military has a history of setting up holding positions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against a numerically superior force, landmines have been an essential tool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for preventing a blitzkrieg style overrunning of our positions in those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environs.  In regions where the US forces do not face a credible threat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overwhelming numbers, landmines are not deployed.  The reason so many
</em><br>
<p>No, instead we drop cluster bombs heh?  Do you deny that there
<br>
is a lot of unexploded ordinance in Laos and Cambodia that is
<br>
from us?  If so, what do you believe should be done about it?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; countries have no problem banning landmines is that most countries do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have troops currently in positions where landmines could legitimately be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used.  The US *does* have troops in places where landmines are an essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the defensive strategy and therefore have no interest in increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the vulnerability of their soldiers.  The wholesale banning of landmines is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in the interest of the US and arguably not in the interest of others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insofar as it applies to the US.
</em><br>
<p>No.  I have an interest in banning inhumane hardware.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, unlike a great many third-world and other militaries, the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military documents, with great detail and precision (in triplicate), the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; location of every single mine it places.  For every mine laid in the field,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a massive paper trail.  Every minefield is precisely mapped and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; archived for posterity.  Many (if not most) militaries in the world do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do this, and many of the problems of undocumented minefields and random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landmines are a direct result of this.  The US military has people whose job
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to clear the minefields that the US has laid, one of the many reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they spend so much time on minefield documentation.  Absent an ongoing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict, the locations of US laid minefields is not considered a secret and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US will typically make great efforts to recover the mines it has laid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously, the US cannot be reasonably held responsible for mines that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has not laid, though I've seen many people attempt to do this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>See and please answer the above question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Third, don't confuse the primitive first generation mine technology that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequently deployed in the third world with state-of-the-art third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation technology that the US typically deploys.  US military mines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on their deployment method and mission, typically contain active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electronics that can 1) use a range of sensors to accurately identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probable military targets as a condition of detonation, and 2) are designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to become inert under a wide range of conditions, both explicitly triggered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and automatic (such as the basic timeout where a mine becomes inert a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain amount of time after it has been laid).  The US military has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expended an extraordinary amount of effort and expense to make their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landmines as &quot;friendly&quot; as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Since some of the ordinance is from the 60s in Southeast Asia, I
<br>
doubt it is state-of-the-art.  But wouldn't that be all the more
<br>
reason we wouldn't mind publishing the details of each types
<br>
characteristics sufficient to disarm them?  Well, according to a
<br>
fairly recent article in Scientific American we do not do this. 
<br>
Why?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In conclusion, the vast majority of landmine problems in the world are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result of the irresponsible use of first and second generation landmine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies, landmines which are still being produced in vast quantities by
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes by us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the Chinese and to a lesser extent the Russians and some European countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To blame the US for problems caused by the irresponsible use by other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; militaries and other regimes that are using landmines that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologically inferior with respect to civilian safety is disingenuous.
</em><br>
<p>I blame us when we could help the situation or the technology
<br>
was produced by us and we refuse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your brush is *way* too broad.  The US has expended vast quantities of money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an effort to make landmine warfare safe; to condemn them for the sins of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others is exactly like condemning a private citizen who has defended their
</em><br>
<p>They are still filthy weapons.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; life with a firearm merely because thugs use firearms to commit crimes also.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As with all things, landmines are merely a tool and the character of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usage reflects the character of the user.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Such tools will never ever be approved of by me.
