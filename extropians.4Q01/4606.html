<p>
Serafino,
<br>
<p>('Maps' but now in the sense of fractal-like representations)
<br>
<p>I'm wondering if you know about Julio Cortazar. He's another South
<br>
American writer. I find his short stories very spooky, and very
<br>
unforgettable.
<br>
<p>One of Cortazar's stories remind me of the 'carpet description' you
<br>
gave, it's like a 'fractal story', just like this is like a 'fractal
<br>
carpet':
<br>
<p>&quot;In Eudossia, that extends up and low, with meandering alleys,
<br>
steps, narrow lanes, hovels, a carpet is kept in which you can
<br>
contemplate the real shape of the city. At first nothing seems to
<br>
resemble less Eudossia than the design of the carpet, ordered in
<br>
symmetrical figures that repeat their patterns along straight and
<br>
circular lines, woven of needleful of dazzling colors, which
<br>
alternating wefts you can follow all along the warp. But if you stop
<br>
to observe it with attention, you perceive that to every place of
<br>
the carpet corresponds a place of the city and that all the things
<br>
contained in the city are comprised in the design, arranged
<br>
according to their true relationships, which escape to your eye
<br>
distracted from the coming and going from the swarming from the
<br>
awful crush. All the confusion in Eudossia, the bray of the mules,
<br>
the spots of lamp-black, the smell of fish, is what appear in the
<br>
partial perspective that you pick; but the carpet proves that there
<br>
is a point from which the city shows its true proportions, the
<br>
geometric outline implicit in its every minimal detail.&quot;
<br>
<p>In Cortazar's short story (two pages): &quot;Continuity of Parks&quot;, the
<br>
reader reads a detailed description of a man sitting in a chair
<br>
reading a book. The reader learns the details of the room: the color
<br>
and fabric of the chair in which the man is sitting: a green velvet
<br>
chair, the direction it is facing: away from the window, for
<br>
example. Then the reader learns about the book that the man is
<br>
reading, and so we read the book as the man reads the book.
<br>
<p>The book (that the man is reading) tells a story of a man and woman
<br>
in a small house in the mountains plotting the murder of another
<br>
man. The two lovers meet, tell each other the details of the murder
<br>
that they about to perform, the alibis that that they will tell,
<br>
then they part ways, and we follow the murderer as he makes his way
<br>
to the home of the person whom he will murder. We follow the
<br>
murderer to the home, to the second story of the home, then to the
<br>
room where he raises his knife to the back of the head to a man
<br>
sitting in green velvet chair facing away from the window reading a
<br>
book ....
<br>
<p>(Cortazar's stories always give me goosebumps)
<br>
