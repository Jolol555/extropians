</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to get other people to contribute, making it a sustainable process?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The problems is even though many extropians like to think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves as early-adopters and flexible, we really aren't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Most people on the list are comfortable with email format.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The people that can't deal with the volume (those that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps like a /. interface) simply aren't on the list --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;once you lose them its difficult to get them back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I regularly peruse /. and nanodot and post less to them than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the extropian list because the overhead is higher.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same was true with javien forums (though the conversation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sorting made it a very appealing in some ways).  One thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that email has above /.  is a relatively &quot;real time&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interface and ease of following &quot;conversations&quot;.  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get that with /. you have to install a headline scroller.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The last time I looked into this it looked more than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little difficult.  If we wanted to try /. again, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the essential components should be distributions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;headline scrollers that worked on Windows, Linux &amp; perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Mac.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is needed is an integration of /. and mailing lists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with an visual interface that can be switched between a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;/. view and a forum view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think it is rumored that some of the integration between /. and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mailing lists may become available in the next release of the /. code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From a technical standpoint, of course the extropian list should be
</em><br>
converted to slashcode--it is a far superior format. However...it will
<br>
not be converted.  Has everyone forgotten that this list is moderated
<br>
in a fashion? I refer to the fact that all new subscribers must have a
<br>
mailing address and an email addy that is paid for (i.e., no free web
<br>
mail accounts are allowed). 
<br>
<p>This practice is meant to, I assume, prevent hit and run trolls that
<br>
would demolish the list with a torrent of personal attacks, etc.
<br>
(although I daresay many would account me a troll for my embarrassing
<br>
pokings-into of the unsavory relationship between immigration, open
<br>
borders, propaganda, and the social contract...)..
<br>
<p>And of course, since the list is an asset for the Extropian Institute,
<br>
an organization positioning itself as both an avant garde mouthpiece
<br>
for business philosophy and a nascent thinktank , it makes perfect
<br>
sense to keep the list on a leash.
