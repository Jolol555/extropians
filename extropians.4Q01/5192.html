<em>&gt; The ACLU is far more than neutral. They have filed numerous amicus curae
</em><br>
<em>&gt; briefs with the courts against the individual rights interpretation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are also involved in the Trauma Project, an alliance of the AMA,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; APA, the ABA, and the ACLU along with Handgun Control Inc (now styling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself as &quot;The Brady Project&quot;) and Andrew McKelvey's (of monster.com
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fame) Americans for Gun Safety in a Orwellian project to assemble a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private nationwide database of gun ownership by violating the medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privacy rights of private citizens. If your doctor is aware of, or has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked you, your spouse, or your children if there are firearms in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; household, in the past three years, then you are now on this database.
</em><br>
<p>Why would they need to ask?  In California they took address and
<br>
checked it against driver's license and gave it to the FBI at
<br>
gun purchase time.  It would be pointless for the docs to also
<br>
go snooping.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Despite this sort of invasiveness being a 'boundary issue' ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violation of doctor-patient confidentiality, millions of family doctors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and emergency room staffers are engaging in this illegal campaign to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identify all gun owners in the US. Furthermore, they are advising family
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of gun owners of the alleged 'risks' of gun ownership (despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the total lack of training by such practitioners in risk assessment or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk management, a lack of certification in the same, and a lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liability insurance for the same). If, for instance, your wife is told
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by her OB-GYN that your self defense pistol should be kept unloaded and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locked up in a safe at all times, they are placing themselves in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position of liability if your lack of ability to access your firearm for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self defense results in injury, death, or other financial losses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I know all of this but I still don't think it is a good excuse
<br>
for comparing the ACLU to terrorists or claiming they are
<br>
murderers.  Why not leave that sort of purple prose to those on
<br>
the other side of your position?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The ACLU will, though, happily defend your doctor against your civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suit in the event you take him/her to court, claiming that the doctor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a first amendment right to disseminate the lies and propaganda of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the anti-gun movement, that whether the doctor is wrong or not is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immaterial to the doctors intent to help protect the patient from harm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (an argument that carries no water in malpractice case law, but would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; play in front of a jury).
</em><br>
<p>Well, as a matter of fact, he does have that right to say
<br>
whatever he wants for whatever reason he wants.  Just like I
<br>
have the right to tell him to mind his own business which is
<br>
what I am paying him for and what he is presumably trained for. 
<br>
Really, I have never had a doctor ask me any such questions.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ACLU is as much a terrorist organization as the al Barakhat money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiring organization in Somalia is. They may not get their own hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bloody, but they enable the deaths of thousands.
</em><br>
<p>That organization is also not terrorist.  Whatever happened to
<br>
anarcho-capitalism and especially the cyber version of same? 
<br>
Did everyone decide these great ideas aren't so great if maybe
<br>
some bad people also use them?  BAH! Some committment to
<br>
freedom.   Damn hypocritical if you ask me.   And no, wiring
<br>
money around does not necessarily make you culpable for anything
<br>
unless you explicitly know what the money is for and endorse
<br>
it.  If you say otherwise then you are only a step from saying
<br>
that ISPs are utterly responsible for every byte of information
<br>
and intent that goes through their servers.
