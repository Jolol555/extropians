<p>My buddy has built HERF guns from WWII search radar magnetrons found at 
<br>
Fair Radio Sales in Lima, Ohio. Unfortunately, what was almost literally a 
<br>
dime a dozen twenty years ago is very rare today. He cleaned them out of 
<br>
all their stock. What they had was stripped of the original magnets - a 
<br>
good thing, as modern permanent magnets are lots smaller than the Alnico 
<br>
ones originally used.
<br>
<p>We have also made &quot;baby&quot; versions from microwave oven maggies - good for 
<br>
upwards of 2 KW pulsed power. The search radar parts were good for almost a 
<br>
megawatt (pulsed).
<br>
<p>All of these can fit in a medium sized plastic Sears mechanic's toolbox, 
<br>
along with twenty minute's worth of batteries. Not exactly a stealthy 
<br>
thing, but at least portable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You can get plans for the ionocraft of de Seversky by looking his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patents up in the US patent database. The plans for the power supply can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be made from those found in books by Information Ulimited of Amherst,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NH.
</em><br>
<p>Do you mean the Igor Sikorsky design that was in Popular Mechanics back in 
<br>
the 1960's? I built a few models, but was never able to get enough thrust 
<br>
to get them airborne. Pretty good airflow, though, if you don't mind a bit 
<br>
of ozone...
