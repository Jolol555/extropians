Jeff asked the $100 question:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there a causative correlated age-related reduction in on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; board nerve growth factor, which might be increased by some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner of stimulation (hormone therapy, gene therapy, other?),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or is the nerve growth factor still at &quot;youthful&quot; levels but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurons are no longer responding as before to those levels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needing more NGF to achieve the higher &quot;youthful&quot; level of response? 
</em><br>
<p>It is generally accepted that protein synthesis declines with
<br>
age.  NGF is, I believe, a peptide growth factor, so &quot;presumably&quot;
<br>
its synthesis declines with age as well (as is the case with
<br>
Growth Hormone and many other hormones).  Now, of course the
<br>
&quot;receptors&quot; for the hormones are transmembrane proteins and
<br>
the signaling factors that transmit the signal indicating
<br>
the &quot;reception&quot; of a hormone to the nucleus (generally altering
<br>
gene expression) are proteins also.  So this turns into a chicken and
<br>
egg problem as to whether the cause is due to a decline in hormone
<br>
production levels or a decline in the receptors and signaling factors.
<br>
Most probably it is both.  In the well studied case of insulin and
<br>
insulin receptors (probably hundreds of papers), I'm unsure as to
<br>
whether there is any conclusive evidence for pointing the
<br>
finger of blame for &quot;insulin resistance&quot; at the production of the
<br>
hormone or the failure to receive and/or transmit the signal properly.
<br>
(I'll admit I haven't studied this specific problem for a couple of
<br>
years though so our understanding may have improved.)
<br>
<p>This problem further complicated by a loss in neuron number with age.
<br>
Since it does not appear that there are feedback loops to
<br>
up-regulate hormone synthesis when amounts are low one would
<br>
expect a decline in hormone levels independent of whether or
<br>
not the cells become less efficient at protein synthesis with age.
<br>
The good part about the article is that it suggests that the
<br>
receptor and intracellular signal pathways are sufficiently
<br>
intact to respond to the signals if we can administer them.
<br>
<p>Regarding species differences in nerve growth factor -- I expect
<br>
they are relatively highly conserved (most hormones are).  I'm
<br>
moderately sure you could look them up in SwissProt for a detailed
<br>
check (though there is always some chance that the Rhesus monkey
<br>
genes haven't been cloned yet).
