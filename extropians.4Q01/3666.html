####I have this strange feeling of deja vu, as if somebody wrote it
<br>
before....
<br>
<p><p>From: &quot;Reason&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:reason@exratio.com?Subject=Re:%20IDENTITY-%20What%20it%20means%20to%20be%20'me'&In-Reply-To=&lt;EB5DDEEFC7B4D411AD3B00508BDFF3E202319111@1upmc-msx7.isdip.upmc.edu&gt;">reason@exratio.com</a>&gt; asked the following question:
<br>
<p>Case 1:
<br>
<p>1) All info on you that is necessary to make an absolutely perfect copy is
<br>
stored; same internal state in your finite state machine self. This process
<br>
happens at point A.
<br>
2) Said info is shipped to point B.
<br>
3) A duplicate of you at that point in time is created at point B.
<br>
4) Steps 1-3 happen in a smaller amount of time than it takes your internal
<br>
state to change.
<br>
5) There are now two of you. What does the identity theory say about this?
<br>
<p>### The answer is crucially dependent on the attitude the individual
<br>
involved in the experiment (A-individual) has towards copying.
<br>
<p>If you feel that the copy is as much a focus of your self-preservation
<br>
instinct as the directly (first person) perceived consciousness, then there
<br>
are indeed two of you, at least as long as the attitude persists in both
<br>
individuals. (This would be my attitude)
<br>
<p>If the A-individual believes that copies are not self (= the value of their
<br>
survival is *not* the same as the value of the first-person consciousness),
<br>
the A-individual will deny selfhood to the B-individual, and the
<br>
B-individual might feel devastated by the realization of his copyhood.
<br>
<p>Attitudes of other people will also impinge on the situation. 
<br>
<p><p>Case 2:
<br>
<p>1) All info on you that is necessary to make an absolutely perfect copy is
<br>
stored; same internal state in your finite state machine self. This process
<br>
happens at point A.
<br>
2) Said info is shipped to point B.
<br>
3) A duplicate of you at that point in time is created at point B.
<br>
4) Steps 1-3 happen in a smaller amount of time than it takes your internal
<br>
state to change.
<br>
5) The original you is now destroyed.
<br>
5) There is now one of you after a short interval of there having been two
<br>
of you. Is it still you?
<br>
<p><p>### See answer to #1 - either the copy is happy for surviving, or he is mad
<br>
about being dead (i.e. has to deal with doubts about his value as a person).
<br>
I would imagine that most likely the copy will insist on being a
<br>
continuation, at least regarding access to bank accounts, etc..
<br>
<p>Case 3:
<br>
<p>1) All info on you that is necessary to make an absolutely perfect copy is
<br>
stored; same internal state in your finite state machine self. This process
<br>
happens at point A.
<br>
2) You are destroyed.
<br>
3) Said info is shipped to point B.
<br>
4) Arbitary time delay occurs.
<br>
5) A duplicate of you at that earlier point in time is created at point B.
<br>
6) There is now one of you after some interval of there having been none of
<br>
you. Is it still you?
<br>
<p>### Same as #2
<br>
<p>As almost everybody who ever joins this recurrent thread, I think that the
<br>
answer is subjective. Yet, in agreement with Hal Finney, I believe that
<br>
there is one intersubjective criterion for selfhood - the ability of a
<br>
self-concept to survive (meaning, to objectively persist in the environment,
<br>
not necessarily with a subjective feeling of continuity with the past or
<br>
future). By intersubjective I mean able to span interpersonal differences,
<br>
without insisting on absolute validity. Those self-concepts which don't
<br>
survive are no less &quot;valid&quot; on their own, but of little intrinsic interest
<br>
to humans, who tend to be very fixated on survival.
<br>
<p>Some concepts will result in a quick physical destruction of their carriers,
<br>
and their own disappearance. Some will persist, be it by defending the
<br>
carrier from damage, or by copying their carriers. Some might transfer the
<br>
self-concept to larger entities, group minds, or spawns (groups of
<br>
semi-independent minds who frequently exchange data by direct neural link,
<br>
and remain one distributed person). I am convinced that a whole menagerie of
<br>
strange twists on &quot;individuals&quot; will develop as soon as the technology
<br>
becomes available.
<br>
<p>I do hope that my own self-concept of non-continuist, spawn-based life will
<br>
result in a large number of its carriers being produced, making it a good
<br>
survival strategy.
