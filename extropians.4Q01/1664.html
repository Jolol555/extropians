Alex said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm NOT only arguing against obeying intellectual property laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm arguing against passage, obedience, enforcement, and for repeal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't dispute the fact that under current law the majority of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list are criminals of one non-violent sort or another, including but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not restricted to copyright infringement. I dispute the legitimacy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility, and enforceability of current law. 
</em><br>
<p>I would argue the counter point for this has been provided before by
<br>
Alex's (rhetorical?) comments about &quot;government intervention&quot; quoted by Rafal:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or is this inefficiency worth it because it creates areas with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high concentrations of technological infrastructure and educated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers so that technology progresses faster than it would if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth/people/tech were distributed purely according to the dynamics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a perfectly competitive market?
</em><br>
<p>If patents or copyrights didn't exist then there would be little
<br>
incentive for investors to provide the funds for everything from
<br>
biotech startups to movies like The Matrix.
<br>
<p>Now note that this is a bit different from the MP3 question
<br>
from the perspective that the infrastructure required for
<br>
biotech startups and movies generally starts at $1-5M.
<br>
That differs from &quot;bands&quot; where the infrastructure required
<br>
might be less than $10K.  Generally speaking bands don't &quot;need&quot;
<br>
investors (though one might view the record labels who
<br>
create bands by design as such) while biotech and movies do.
<br>
<p>So if you want rapid technology progress you *need* to have a
<br>
system where investors believe that they will have a &quot;protected&quot;
<br>
ROI that balances the risk of early stage investments.
<br>
<p>Note that as costs decline for such things as HDTV cameras,
<br>
computer based film editing equipment and VR design tools
<br>
become increasingly realistic and run on faster computers
<br>
I think the film industry becomes more like the music industry
<br>
(in its need for &quot;protection&quot;).  The same may be true in the
<br>
biotechnology industry over the next decade as technologies
<br>
develop.  I suspect however there will always be some industries
<br>
that will require protection for investors to take risks
<br>
that facilitate their development.  Thus, IMO, the solution
<br>
is not to do away with patents and copyrights but to reform
<br>
them to match specific industries (e.g. drug patents that
<br>
last 10 years instead of 20).
