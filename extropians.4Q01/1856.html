<p><em>&gt;For anybody who missed the connection, Donald Brownlee and Peter D. Ward are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the authors of the book, Rare Earth, previously discussed on this list. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;book of course goes into these issues in much greater detail. The hardback
</em><br>
<em>&gt;edition has been remaindered and is selling at Amazon for $8.25. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't seem to be a paperback edition, so it may disappear in a while.
</em><br>
<p>You might be interested to know that some (or many) astronomers are
<br>
treating the Rare Earth book with a fair bit of criticism.
<br>
<p>The following, attached review I saved from sci.astro 1 1/2 years ago.
<br>
I haven't finished reading the book yet, but I agree (so far) with
<br>
Joseph Lazio's comments below.
<br>
<p>This part I can add to:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Moreover, it's also worth noting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the Sun is currently inside a cavity of hot gas known as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Local Bubble.  This cavity may have been formed by one or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supernovae within the (astronomically) recent past.  Obviously, life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on Earth survived.
</em><br>
<p>There's been a lot of work on characterizing the local region around
<br>
the Sun. One should look up the work by Priscilla Frisch at U of Chicago.
<br>
Most likely several supernova-triggered star-forming epochs occurred
<br>
within 1500 light years of the Sun. The Sun has been passing through a
<br>
hot, very low-density region, the Local Bubble, for several million years,
<br>
and it is now embedded in a  shell of warm, partly ionized material flowing
<br>
from the Scorpius-Centaurus  star-forming region. Within this shell,
<br>
in a region of about 10 light years across, we have our &quot;Local Interstellar
<br>
Cloud (LIC). Part of the LIC cuts across the Sun's path, where the we
<br>
know some characteristics:
<br>
<p>atomic neutral hydrogen density: 0.22 cm^(-3)
<br>
temperature: 6900 K
<br>
relative Sun-LIC velocity of aobut 26 km-sec^(-1)
<br>
<p>In our 10 l.y. LIC environment evidence of both low and high velocity
<br>
shocks (20 to 200 km-sec^(-1) are found. So Ward and Brownlee should
<br>
be aware that our own solar system formed within a very complex
<br>
enviroment, and here, intelligent life exists.. strange as it
<br>
seems sometimes.
<br>
<p>One of our goals in the Heidelberg Dust group is to learn more about
<br>
the interstellar dust that we are detecting flowing through the
<br>
solar system (following up on the Ulysses discovery of interstellar
<br>
dust 9 years ago). We have a &quot;Dust Telescope&quot; project that is in a
<br>
study by ESA right now, that we are hoping to be funded.

<br>
<p>Written by a pair of professors at the University of Washington, _Rare
<br>
Earth_ is a polemic for the view that complex life, both animals and
<br>
higher planets, is rare in the Milky Way Galaxy and perhaps even in
<br>
the Universe.  Thus, the authors contend that there could be many,
<br>
perhaps millions, of planets scattered throughout the Galaxy on which
<br>
single-celled microorganisms thrive.  On only a handful of planets,
<br>
perhaps only one, would the air be filled with flying creatures and
<br>
the ground covered with creepy or crawly things.
<br>
<p>Cast in terms of the Drake equation, the authors believe that f_l, the
<br>
probability that life will originate on a habitable planet, could
<br>
approach unity (1).  However, they argue that f_h, the fraction of
<br>
planets that are habitable, and f_i, the probability that intelligent
<br>
life will develop on a planet on which life has emerged, are
<br>
individually or both probably quite close to 0.  Thus, the total
<br>
number of technological civilizations in the Galaxy would be small,
<br>
perhaps only one.  (However, they also mis-characterize the Drake
<br>
equation as assuming that &quot;once life originates on a planet, it
<br>
evolves toward ever higher complexity.&quot;  As the Drake equation
<br>
contains a factor f_i there is clearly no assumption in the Drake
<br>
equation itself that life &quot;evolves toward ever higher complexity.&quot;)
<br>
<p>The authors bring to bear a number of different aspects of the Earth's
<br>
astrophysical, geological, and biological history, some of them fairly
<br>
recently appreciated, to support their argument.  Among these aspects
<br>
are
<br>
* A Galactic habitable zone, the possibility that habitable planets
<br>
can only exist in a restricted region of the Galaxy,
<br>
* A temporal habitable zone, based on the fact that a star's
<br>
luminosity gradually increases over time meaning that in 1 billion
<br>
years or so the Sun will boil away the Earth's oceans,
<br>
* The presence of a comet-slaying giant planet to reduce considerably
<br>
the number of comets that strike a habitable planet, like Jupiter in
<br>
our solar system,
<br>
* The &quot;snowball&quot; Earth hypothesis, that on at least two occasions the
<br>
Earth's oceans may have largely or entirely frozen over, and
<br>
* The time between the first appearance of life on this planet and the
<br>
Cambrian explosion when the diversity of life exploded and animal life
<br>
first appeared.
<br>
<p>It has been this reviewer's experience that reading well-written
<br>
apologies of a position with which one disagrees can often make one
<br>
sharpen one's arguments.  _Rare Earth_ cannot be put in this
<br>
category.  I found it not only to be not convincing, but not
<br>
particularly thought provoking and in some places sloppy almost to the
<br>
point of being wrong.
<br>
<p>Consider just a few examples.  The authors suggest a Galactic
<br>
habitable zone.  They contend that too close to the Galaxy's center a
<br>
planet would be fried by the intense radiation at the center, too far
<br>
from the center and Earth-like planets might never form because the
<br>
clouds of dust and gas at the edge of the Galaxy do not contain enough
<br>
&quot;metals&quot; to form terrestrial planets.  In principle they are correct.
<br>
(I would add that too close to the Galaxy's center terrestrial planets
<br>
might never form or would be ejected quickly because of the frequent
<br>
close passages of other stars.)  In practice, what is the size of this
<br>
Galactic habitable zone?  They argue for an apparently quite small
<br>
zone, though they provide no firm quantitative estimate.  I would
<br>
certainly agree that the inner 300 light years, maybe the inner 1000
<br>
light years, of the Galaxy are probably not too hospitable.  They list
<br>
a number of possible hazards that life toward the Galactic center
<br>
might face---ionizing radiation (but how strong would the radiation
<br>
have to be before the atmosphere of a planet would not protect life on
<br>
its surface?), strongly magnetized neutron stars (which are how
<br>
frequent?), and supernovae.  Their primary concern seems to be with
<br>
supernovae, but they also seem to neglect one favorable aspect of the
<br>
inner regions of the Galaxy.  The interstellar gas density in the
<br>
inner regions of the Galaxy is higher than near the Sun (and many
<br>
supernovae occur in or near quite dense molecular clouds).  This
<br>
higher gas density should also decrease the effects of nearby
<br>
supernovae on planets with life.  Moreover, it's also worth noting
<br>
that the Sun is currently inside a cavity of hot gas known as the
<br>
Local Bubble.  This cavity may have been formed by one or more
<br>
supernovae within the (astronomically) recent past.  Obviously, life
<br>
on Earth survived.  Similarly, they provide no outer radius for their
<br>
Galactic habitable zone, but assert that there must be one based on
<br>
the general decrease of &quot;metals&quot; as one goes outward from the Galactic
<br>
center.  It is true that there is such a general decrease, but there
<br>
is also considerable scatter about the general trend.  Thus, the outer
<br>
radius is probably far more &quot;fuzzy&quot; than they describe it.
<br>
<p>On the topic of the Galaxy's habitable zone, the authors seem to imply
<br>
that the Sun has little or no interaction with the Galaxy's spiral
<br>
arms and that the inter-arm regions of a spiral galaxy have a lower
<br>
stellar density than inside the spiral arms.  Neither is correct.  It
<br>
is true that the Sun is not now located in a spiral arm (or if it is,
<br>
it is located in a &quot;spur&quot;).  However, the Sun orbits the Galactic
<br>
center, taking about 250 million years to do so.  The Galaxy's spiral
<br>
arms do *not* rotate with the stars.  The Sun therefore probably
<br>
passes through at least one spiral arm every orbit.  Over its lifetime
<br>
the Sun has made approximately 20 orbits, plenty of time to pass
<br>
through multiple spiral arms.  Indeed the authors seem to be unaware
<br>
of a proposal that massive extinctions in the Earth's past are caused
<br>
by passage of the Sun through a spiral arm.  (The proposed mechanism
<br>
is that the gravitational effects of the large dust and gas clouds in
<br>
a spiral arm could cause an increase in the number of comets falling
<br>
into the inner solar system and thereby striking the Earth.)  Nor are
<br>
the inter-arm regions are devoid of stars, as the authors seem to
<br>
imply.  Indeed, if one looks at a spiral galaxy in the red light
<br>
produced by the numerous low-mass stars (like the Sun), the spiral
<br>
pattern can nearly disappear.  Spiral galaxies appear spiral largely
<br>
because of the enormous quantities of light produced by the hot,
<br>
relatively rare, and short-lived hot stars.
<br>
<p>The authors also do a poor job of arguing that there may not be many
<br>
Earth-like planets.  They note that there have been many planets
<br>
discovered recently, but all are larger than Jupiter.  They note,
<br>
correctly, that there have been considerable selection effects against
<br>
the detection of smaller-mass planets (around main-sequence stars).
<br>
They end up concluding that terrestrial planets may therefore be rare.
<br>
(Not only that, elsewhere they suggest that Jovian planets might
<br>
rare!)  Indeed, it is the prevailing opinion is that the stars
<br>
currently known to be orbited by a Jovian planet probably do not have
<br>
terrestrial planets.  (The reason is that these Jovian planets are
<br>
thought not to form in the current location but to have migrated
<br>
closer to their star from their formation location which was similar
<br>
to Jupiter's current distance from the Sun.  In the migration process
<br>
any terrestrial planets would have been ejected from the system or
<br>
scattered into the star.  Of course nobody expected to find these &quot;hot
<br>
Jupiters&quot; in the first place so maybe many of those stars are also
<br>
orbited by terrestrial planets?)
<br>
<p>What about those stars, the majority of those surveyed thus far, that
<br>
are not orbited by &quot;hot Jupiters&quot;?  Are they orbited only by &quot;cold
<br>
Jupiters&quot; that did not migrate inward? or might they also have
<br>
terrestrial mass companions?  The following line of reasoning is, to
<br>
this reviewer, equally or more plausible as the one suggested by the
<br>
authors.  The first planets ever detected convincingly are around the
<br>
pulsar PSR B1257+12.  They are terrestrial mass.  Their existence
<br>
suggests that planets can form in a variety of environments.
<br>
Therefore we should expect planets to be nearly ubiquitous.  Moreover,
<br>
given the range of masses in various systems---PSR B1257+12's planets
<br>
range in mass from lunar mass to greater than Earth mass, the Sun's
<br>
planets range in mass from Jupiter to Mercury and Pluto, even the
<br>
masses of the various &quot;hot Jupiters&quot; range over a factor of ten---we
<br>
would expect that other planetary systems might have a wide range of
<br>
masses, too.  Thus, terrestrial planets might be plentiful.
<br>
<p>(After the publication of _Rare Earth_, the discovery of Saturn-mass
<br>
planets was announced.  From the census of planets around
<br>
main-sequence stars, there is the *hint* that lower-mass planets are
<br>
in fact more numerous than higher mass planets.  I do not criticize
<br>
the authors for not knowing the future, but I do think these results
<br>
suggest they are wrong.)
<br>
<p>These are a few examples of how the authors' points seem muddled or
<br>
poorly thought out.  There are a host of other examples.  They present
<br>
the &quot;snowball Earth&quot; hypothesis as near fact even though it is by no
<br>
means widely accepted by geologists.  Even if we accept that the Earth
<br>
went through a snowball phase, was it essential to life's later
<br>
diversification? or did it slow down life's inevitable
<br>
diversification? and on how many other Earth-like planets would a
<br>
snowball phase occur?  (Of course the answer to all of the above is,
<br>
we do not know.)  They seem to overestimate both the fraction of stars
<br>
in open star clusters and the likelihood of a close encounter between
<br>
stars in an open cluster which could disrupt planetary orbits.  They
<br>
seem to spend an inordinate amount of time discussing stars in
<br>
globular clusters, even though only a miniscule fraction of stars in
<br>
the Milky Way Galaxy are in globular clusters and there are a number
<br>
of reasons to suspect that planets might not be frequent in globular
<br>
clusters.  They discuss the possible importance of lunar tides in the
<br>
ocean without ever noting that the solar tides are not that much
<br>
weaker (only a factor of three).
<br>
<p>In many places the presentation also seems muddled.  I am not sure if
<br>
this is the fault of the editor or the authors.  However, if there is
<br>
an entire chapter on the &quot;snowball Earth&quot; hypothesis, why are we asked
<br>
to conduct a thought experiment in at least two other sections of the
<br>
book on the consequences of the Earth's oceans freezing over?  Why not
<br>
just refer to the appropriate chapter?  Similarly, if we are told that
<br>
Jupiter is more than 300 times the mass of the Earth (p. 235), do we
<br>
really need to be told less than three pages later that Jupiter's mass
<br>
is 318 Earth masses (p. 238)?
<br>
<p>Finally, the tone of the book, in many places, struck me like a book
<br>
report.  Perhaps it is because I manage to keep abreast of
<br>
developments in fields outside of astronomy by reading the first
<br>
sections of the journal Science.  (Indeed, this is a good strategy for
<br>
other interested in recent developments in astronomy, planetary
<br>
science, geology, and biology.  Subscribe to a journal like _Science_
<br>
or _Nature_ and read the short updates that fill the first few
<br>
sections of the journal.)  Yet I somehow have the sense that having
<br>
read sections of _Science_ over the past few years, I too could have
<br>
written this book.
<br>
<p>In summary, if you are already of the persuasion that animal life
<br>
and/or technical civilizations are rare in the Galaxy, reading this
<br>
book probably will provide you with warm fuzzies.  Your opinion will
<br>
be seconded, but you probably won't gain much.  If you are not of this
<br>
persuasion, you probably have better things to do with your time than
<br>
read this book.  If you really feel you must, wait until your local
<br>
library obtains a copy, then stroll down there some afternoon when you
<br>
have nothing better to do.
<br>
<p>(After I finished this review, I read the review by C. P. McKay in the
<br>
2000 April 28 issue of _Science_.  McKay is one of the premier
<br>
astrobiologists.  His review seems lukewarm.  He describes the authors
<br>
as &quot;[making] the case (if not always convincingly) that the situation
<br>
on our Earth is optimal for the devlopment of complex life.&quot;  Later he
<br>
also writes that &quot;we have only one example of life&quot; and that the
<br>
&quot;assessment of [the] probability&quot; for the development of life &quot;is
<br>
uncertain at best.&quot;  He concludes that &quot;theories of life and
<br>
evolution&quot; should guide us but not constrain us&quot;---they may be wrong.
<br>
In this spirit _Rare Earth_ provides a sobering [...] perspective in
<br>
just how difficult it might be for complex life [...] to arise.&quot;)

<p>I think you could have been a bit stronger here.  Conventional wisdom
(e.g., Zaritsky et al, 1994 ApJ 420, 87, Table 3) is that the typical
abundance gradients are of order -0.05 dex/kpc but with considerable
uncertainties and differences among galaxies.  (One galaxy even shows
a positive gradient, but it's less than one sigma above zero.)
<p>If we accept the typical gradient, the Sun at 8 kpc should have 40%
of the metals at the Galactic center, and a star at 16 kpc should
have 40% of Solar metallicity.  But who says 40% of Solar isn't
enough to form planets and life?  And even if not, _most_ stars in
the Milky Way are closer to the Galactic center than the Sun.
(Stellar density in the disk is exponential with a scale length
between 5 and 8 kpc.)  So any metallicity &quot;cutoff&quot; is unlikely to
have a big effect on the number of stars with planets or life unless
you are prepared to believe that the Sun itself is well below the
metallicity cutoff and only has planets and life as an unlikely
fluke.
<p>Based on some recent work and things I've heard, it is my _suspicion_
(not yet anything so strong as an _opinion_ or even _guess_) that the
conventional wisdom of abundance gradients will need reexamination.
I expect much progress once SIRTF is operational.
