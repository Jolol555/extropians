<br>
<em>&gt; I've always thought the point behind a working definition was that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't at the stage of being able to provide adequate rigor.  In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words, if you have rigor, you've gone beyond the working definition stage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, this is somewhat fuzzy in any give case.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;g&gt; Yes, it's especially fuzzy in the case of &quot;God.&quot; I think we've established
<br>
that the meaning of the word is vague at best and meaningless at worst. That's
<br>
rather ominous for a nation that prints &quot;In God we trust&quot; on its currency.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I would say that the word &quot;God&quot; does have a definition, but that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition does not fit anything that exists (and is incoherent).
</em><br>
<p>True, theism doesn't even qualify as a hypothesis, because it's unprovable no
<br>
matter how we define it. Consequently, theism doesn't cohere with any theory
<br>
in science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not if they use it in the convention sense.  Of course, one can use a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however one wishes.  I can define &quot;physics&quot; as what most people would call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;fantasy,&quot; but I don't think that's the point here.
</em><br>
<p>Right, the point is that without sufficient definitions, discourse becomes an
<br>
exercise in rhetoric and/or emotional transaction... which is what I think the
<br>
&quot;God bless America&quot; slogan really entails. No one really cares what it
<br>
actually means. It's the feeling behind it that counts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But while there would be a difference, wouldn't &quot;theism&quot; contain the concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;God&quot; -- theism being a belief in God or gods?
</em><br>
<p>You're right, this probably obscures the issue unnecessarily, and I guess it's
<br>
somewhat like the difference between Communism and Marxism. Someone can be a
<br>
communist without being a Marxist, but not a Marxist without being a
<br>
communist. So, one can be a theist without believing in God, but one can't
<br>
believe in God without being a theist. Anyway, I don't care if people yell
<br>
&quot;God bless America&quot; until they're blue in the face... What really matters is
<br>
how well America responds with technology and physical means to the terrorism
<br>
of 9-11. What worries me is that the religious fundamentalists in the US may
<br>
have an agenda to use this incident to fulfill the prophecies of Armageddon
<br>
that their religion mandates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, while I do think the statement &quot;God bless America&quot; is basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benevolent, I disagree with George H. Smith in his conclusions.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it's somehow devoid of religious content or connotations of the bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort.  Still, I don't argue with most people who mouth it.  There are other,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more important things to do.
</em><br>
<p>Right on... We won't move into a better future until we debunk religiosity
<br>
altogether, because it's the most regressive force now operating in society.
