<em>&gt; The great thing about pessimism is that there is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow....
</em><br>
<p>&quot;An optimist is someone who thinks the future is uncertain.&quot;
<br>
--Alligator Grundy
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact is that things are better, much much better today, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a little hard work can be even better tomorrow.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;All parents are environmentalists -- until the birth of their second child.&quot;
<br>
--Chrom Blackstone
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Those who said it would be years, if ever, for these gains to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplished were WRONG.
</em><br>
<p>Then again, we're closer to the possibility of a global holocaust then we've
<br>
ever been before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The trick to defusing the fundamentalists is to make future plans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and scenarios all inclusive. Those who want to take part can and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who don't want to can stay home and sulk.
</em><br>
<p>That would mean the price of admission to take part would have to be zero.
<br>
Difficult to believe that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The battle is clearly on the side of advanced technology, bringing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along advanced ethics is also a good idea.
</em><br>
<p>The more we bring ethics into it, the more resistence to advanced technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The best we may be able to hope for is minimal casualties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on both sides.  In that respect the news of the last couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of days has been heartening since we can get on with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;business of feeding people rather than bombing or shooting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;them.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that is hopeful indeed. Feed the people hope. You're a nice person,
<br>
Brian.
<br>
<p>&quot;You'll learn to like robots.
<br>
They'll be nicer than human beings.&quot;
<br>
--Hans Moravec

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
