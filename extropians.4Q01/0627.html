<p><em>&gt; Tell me, what scientific methodology to you use to determine

<p>Think about what you mean by &quot;I am happy&quot; or &quot;I am in love.&quot;
<br>
The true question here is if the correlation between what
<br>
you're feeling and what other people feel when they say they
<br>
are happy or in love is correct.  You might think that you are
<br>
in love, for example, and later notice that a friend who also
<br>
claims to be in love appears to be in state far removed from
<br>
your own, given this you might question whether what you're
<br>
experiencing is love.  Formalise this - that is, act on it
<br>
consciously and aim for precision - and it's science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that a painting is really good (or bad)?
</em><br>
<p>Depends what you mean by &quot;really.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that a person is or is not to be trusted and how much?
</em><br>
<p>You conjecture about their motivations and keep an eye out for
<br>
evidence to the contrary.  Again, formalise this and it's
<br>
science.  It's just a matter of rigour.  Trust is a good
<br>
example because it's close to a &quot;casual science&quot; in which we
<br>
make conscious observations and even perform experiments.
<br>
<p>Scientific methodology is really just the sort of thing we do
<br>
all the time with the &quot;rigour knob&quot; turned up high.
