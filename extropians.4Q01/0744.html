John uttered the heartfelt
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sasha, and now John Perry have left our ranks.  I just don't want to see any more casualties.  I believe in an afterlife, and have faith both men are there now.  But still, I want to see each transhumanist I know attain their fondest dreams in this world.
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure if I published this on the list; if so, I beg pardon for the repetition.
<br>
<p>My two fondest dreams in this world are to help create a world that (A) I wouldn't mind coming back to, and a world that
<br>
(B) wouldn't mind bringing me back, in that order. Preferably, the same world in both cases, although emigration from B
<br>
to A could work... :)
<br>
<p>_Actually being brought back_ is at least D on my list.
<br>
<p>So I calculate risks and take them. If I croak, remember what I've said and take it into account if I don't get
<br>
suspended. It's a long shot, anyway. :)
<br>
<p>Tycho Brahe's last words were allegedly 
<br>
&quot;Let me not seem to have lived in vain. Let me not seem to have lived in vain...&quot;
<br>
<p>Dum vivimus, vivamus.
