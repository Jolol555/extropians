<p>
John, Randy Smith, et. al., 
<br>
<p>For the sake of a little accuracy, since you bring up the past,
<br>
I looked up the &quot;immoral cur&quot; post.  Here is the snippet.  As
<br>
you can see, I did not practice any ad hominem in this remark.
<br>
<p>--- replay from 10/07/01 --- 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;We ultimately  did it because we could get away with it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A keen grasp of the obvious. The good thing is we can and well get away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with even more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think I want to speak to anyone who takes that opinion
<br>
in such matters of human life and death and international
<br>
relations.  If that is your attitude then everyone not in your
<br>
US club is quite justified in despising you as an immoral curr. 
<br>
To the extent the US acts inline with your sentiment they would
<br>
be quite justified in hatred toward it and in taking any means
<br>
they can to strike back.  Is that honestly what you want?  A war
<br>
of all against all until the strongest and perhaps most vile is
<br>
the only one left standing?
<br>
<p>--- end of replay ------
<br>
<p>So it looks like I had nothing there to apologize about.  Have a
<br>
nice day.
<br>
<p>- samantha
