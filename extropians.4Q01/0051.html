A good idea, would love to see straight jackets on the kids that kick the
<br>
seat in front of then ALL during the flight. Now if we can just get
<br>
detectors that spot sick kids (and adults) and keep them off the flight....
<br>
<p>nope too much to hope for.

<p><em>&gt;Here's an idea: all passengers must remain in straight jackets for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entire flight. I bet that would go over like a lead balloon.
