You think that'll really matter to anyone off this list? I have heard during discussions, with a very, very lapsed, Roman Catholic, that monotheism is troublesome, because &quot;..what if you piss-off the only god, then you have nobody else to turn to?..&quot;  
<br>
<p>A very friendly Sysop may never be reverently worshipped; but on the other hand, people of our pre-Singularity ilk, may be so grateful, that worship may indeed occur, or veneration.  We may end up being The Grateful Dead, with genuine reference to Master's Garcia and Weir.
<br>
<p>The Jupiter Minds of a later era may chuckle at our foolishness, and well they may have a reason to. But our gratitude for goodies imagined by Transhumanist philosophers, may be sincere, all the more.
<br>
<p>The Super-powered psychotic three year old you refer to, I remind you is what the Islamists, are very comfortable praying to, and murdering for. In a sense its not yours or mine to control, but whatever the ultimate mind or minds decide is necessary or desirable.
<br>
Maybe the Taleban will be written to file and forgotten about, dwelling in their Islamic paradises, sans Christians, Jews, Atheists, Buddhists, and Hindu's? 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;And there's no point at all in praying to a Friendly mind of any kind,
<br>
Sysop-level or otherwise; no Friendly mind would demand reverence or
<br>
obedience or faith or anything of the sort.
<br>
<p>The division between rationality and thinking any damn thought that pops
<br>
into your head is valuable and dearly bought.  So is the distinction
<br>
between technology and magic, or between a world of Similarity and
<br>
Contagion and a world of cause and effect.  We shouldn't throw it away so
<br>
cheaply by casually conflating a Friendly superintelligence and a
<br>
psychotic superpowered three-year-old in the sky.
