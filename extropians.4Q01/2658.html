<p>Not from long experience, you can be sure of that... it comes mostly from
<br>
my scant readings.  Note that I did specify overwhelming military
<br>
superiority, including one-sided air support and so on.  My impression
<br>
from my scant readings is that it's hard to root enemy guerilla troops out
<br>
of a countryside since they will not obligingly concentrate in front of
<br>
your superior firepower, or indeed present themselves for attack at all. 
<br>
A city is a clearly defined target where you can make full use of
<br>
overwhelming force, though fighting house-to-house once you've taken the
<br>
city can turn into another guerilla problem.  But, again, that's *after*
<br>
you've taken the city.  I never heard that guerillas had the reputation of
<br>
being able to make a stand and defend a target from superior enemy forces;
<br>
in fact, from what I've heard that's exactly what guerillas don't do. 
<br>
&quot;Enemy advances, we retreat.&quot;  That's why I was nonplussed by all the fuss
<br>
over the taking of Kabul.
