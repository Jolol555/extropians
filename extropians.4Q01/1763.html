Yes, his Phantoms in the Brain is an interesting read. Very breezy style too. Actually, I'm typing from his lab right now. I work here. He's currently interested in synesthesia and the relationship between thought and language.

<em>&gt;&gt; I know, I have listened to Ramachandran's lectures and they are very fun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (last time he got into a debate with last year's nobel laureate Eric
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Kandel about art theory). I have not yet read his books, but if they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; half as fun as his lectures they are really worth checking out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dunno about his books either, but his Nova show was more than fun. His theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about neural wiring and pathways is verified by experiment. The implication is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that our brains are not &quot;hard-wired&quot; from birth, but rather grow connections
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that map reality (and our bodies) onto the cerebral cortex. So, the brain is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not a computer registering sensory input, but rather an emulation-in-progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as the sensory inputs actually define and direct the architecture of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Especially interesting is his idea of awareness as a concentration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deliberate attention rather than an epiphenomenon of cognitive interaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the environment. The best part of all was when he described the neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pathways between vision and emotional salience, in the segment about David,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the man with a condition called Capgras Delusion. He knew who and where he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was, but he was sure that the people who said they were his parents were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imposters. Dr. Ramachandran says David's injury destroyed pathways for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emotional information, and since he didn't feel the appropriate emotions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toward his parents, he concluded that they were lying look-alikes. (Reminder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to uploaders: Don't forget to include the enteric nervous system.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Another file concerned John, who has temporal lobe epilepsy, and his seizures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leave him with the absolute conviction that he is God. The doctor suggests
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the seizures may have disrupted a part of the brain &quot;whose activity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somehow conducive to religious belief,&quot; and that such a receptive region may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have evolved because &quot;it's conducive to stability of society.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The doctor failed, however, to mention that it may also be conducive to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emergence of suicide bombers, but then, the show was created way before Sept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;11.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Conclusion: The cognitive significance of sensations makes experience the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;valuable part of human knowledge.
