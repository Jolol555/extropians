<p>Technologies do not have to be self-replicating to be available
<br>
inexpensively.  Most vaccines are not self-replicating (though
<br>
the &quot;factories&quot; that produce them are).  But it isn't the self-replication
<br>
characteristic that makes them cheap -- they are cheap primarily
<br>
because on a mass basis you don't need very much material.  The
<br>
same thing is true for floppies, CDs, cell phones, etc.  Its
<br>
cars and houses that remain expensive even when mass produced.
<br>
<p>Self-assembly is also important -- vaccines self-assemble, houses
<br>
do not.  The labor cost component is important to keep in mind.
<br>
<p>The question you have to ask with regard to patents -- is there
<br>
only one way to do it?  If you only have 3 engineers to think
<br>
about the problem the answer may be yes.  But if you have 300
<br>
engineers to think about the problem, the answer is likely to
<br>
be no.  There are literally millions of types of self-replicating
<br>
systems out there -- I doubt the patent barriers will provide
<br>
a significant firewall to the spread of such technologies from the
<br>
first to the third world.

<p>But is that idea valid?  Where does it come from?
<br>
(Yes, I know Robin has argued it to some extent but it seems
<br>
to be true if there is only &quot;one&quot; economy/environment --
<br>
people and species survive perfectly well in a variety of
<br>
economies and environments today without having &quot;better&quot; brains.)
<br>
<p>The concept of &quot;poor and powerless&quot; suggests that in some way their
<br>
survival will be threatened.  But as &quot;we&quot; know there are plenty
<br>
of resources to support the population we can envision existing
<br>
on the planet within the next 50-100 years.  There is no need
<br>
for SIs to run around eliminating persons who choose to remain
<br>
pre-post-human.  There seems to be no inherently obvious argument
<br>
as to why upevolution is required unless you propose an argument
<br>
that some amoral SI chooses to gobble up all the matter and energy
<br>
locally available.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That slots neatly into a lot of political pre-programming and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives us a ready-made organized political resistance to our projects. 
</em><br>
<p>People operate with meme sets that say &quot;If I'm alive, my current
<br>
operating system (gene/meme-set) must be working.&quot;  It is change itself
<br>
that produces the resistance -- not so much &quot;political pre-programming&quot;.
<br>
This is, IMO, more &quot;genetic pre-programming&quot;.  Accelerating change
<br>
generates accelerating resistance because you have increasingly diminished
<br>
confidence that your current gene/meme-set will ensure survival.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Meanwhile those who think that genetic engineering, AI, nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and all other new tech will make the current inequalities *worse* sit on
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (<a href="http://www.rafi.org/web/docus/pdfs/DD99_1-2.pdf">http://www.rafi.org/web/docus/pdfs/DD99_1-2.pdf</a>)
</em><br>
<p>I'll add:
<br>
HyPEing the Human Genome
<br>
<a href="http://www.rafi.org/web/docus/pdfs/NR-HG2001.pdf">http://www.rafi.org/web/docus/pdfs/NR-HG2001.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>I've looked briefly at the &quot;The ETC Century&quot; and its a significant
<br>
piece.  It isn't clear to me from glancing at it (I haven't read
<br>
all 128 pages in detail) what their primary gripe is.  It seems
<br>
that they are afraid that corporations will end up concentrating
<br>
and controlling the technologies, ascerbating inequalities
<br>
destroying the environment &amp; biodiversity.  It discusses
<br>
pretty much everything -- biotech, nanotech, human performance
<br>
enhancement, bioterrorism, global media enterprises, etc.
<br>
<p>One interesting quote:
<br>
&quot;As our survival base erodes and uncertain new technologies muscle
<br>
their way into our social infrastructure, extraordinarily powerful
<br>
new corporate configurations are replacing governments and engineering
<br>
new systems of control over almost everything.&quot;
<br>
<p>It seems to come across as anti-technology and anti-change in general.
<br>
<p>The thing is that the technologies *will* make &quot;current inequalities
<br>
*worse*&quot; but it seems to me that you will have a fair amount of choice
<br>
as to precisely *where* you want to be in terms of your use of those
<br>
technologies (a pre-post-human Amish lifestyle to an uploaded Jupiter
<br>
Brain).  In that respect, the report seems to want to push us
<br>
in the direction where every individual *is* precisely equal.
<br>
So much for cultural diversity.
