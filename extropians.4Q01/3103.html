<em>&gt;&gt; I think all list members got it, whether they agree or not.

<em>&gt;Apparently this is not so judging from the comments I still see

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I understand the importance you attach to it, but as important as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is, I don't think you will convince people who do not agree with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by massive repetition ; it will only raise their irritation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The above is why I try to say it again.  How can I be silent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when I see what looks to me like very hardened and dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attitudes being expressed that greatly worry me.  Would I not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remiss if I did not speak out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It is not &quot;the last who talks wins the argument&quot;, and one should not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; based on such principle, repeat the same thing until the opponent gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; silent... How is the resulting &quot;repetition flood&quot; respectful to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; list members ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I said nothing I said out of disrespect.  Quite the contrary.

You obviously do not understand Samantha's position; it is a messianic pacifism-at-any-cost-including-freedom-and-security position that is inflamed with the fervour of religious certainty.  She therefore sees anyone and everyone who would disagree with it as dim and uncomprehending brutes;  if the UNDERSTOOD her, they couldn't OF COURSE help but to AGREE with her, for it is WITHOUT QUESTION in her mind that her position is RIGHT.
<br>
Of course, she is wrong, but she is also memetically incapable of grokking same, just like a fundis fanatic for any other absolutist position is.
