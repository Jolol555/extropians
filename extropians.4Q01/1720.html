<p>Yes there is. Closed hardware specifications from manufacturers being

strongarmed by Microsoft. Driver and application signing. The software
<br>
as service model. Bundling. Most importantly, the ongoing legal
<br>
assault electronic freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and
<br>
freedom from unreasonable search and seizure which are MORE important
<br>
than their meatspace counterparts.

<p><em>&gt; Actually being in possession of illegally copied material is

</em><br>
<p>Yes, and hiring a hooker is defined as a sexual offense in most
<br>
places.  And smoking a joint is defined as some kind of narcotics
<br>
violation (except in the UK as of recently, congrats to all the
<br>
British list members). And all we need are a few more school shootings
<br>
and even more types of guns will get defined as assault weapons. Legal
<br>
definitions don't impress me as much as they used to.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only time an MP3 is a nonexcludable nonrival good is when it is
</em><br>

<p>You're again confusing your personal concept of morality with the
<br>
facts on the ground. If I create a lighthouse, my claims on it make
<br>
not one whit of difference in whether or not ships are going to use
<br>
it for navigation. Not without lighthouse cops on every ship making
<br>
sure that nobody on board is looking at my lighthouse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words like I said you can create your own independent work
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thanks.
