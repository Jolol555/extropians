ARM THE AFGHAN WOMEN
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Wendy McElroy &lt;<a href="mailto:mac@zetetics.com?Subject=Re:%20Arm%20the%20Afghan%20Women!&In-Reply-To=&lt;00e501c17626$1fbb7be0$d486ecd1@neptune&gt;">mac@zetetics.com</a>&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special to TLE (The Libertarian Enterprise #149)
<br>
<p>It is commonplace to assume that toppling the Taliban will free
<br>
Afghan women. But in an unstable country where soldiers celebrate
<br>
conquest by raping - and where there is currently no guarantee that
<br>
whatever form of government eventually assumes control will not be
<br>
equally oppressive toward females - women have to protect themselves
<br>
to remain free.
<br>
<p>Afghan women need to exercise the right of self-defense, including
<br>
gun ownership. They also need to be recognized as a force of armed
<br>
resistance against oppressive regimes.
<br>
<p>Freedom Fighters
<br>
<p>In the 1970's, Afghan women were among the most Westernized and
<br>
liberated in the Islamic world. Their pre-Taliban role as doctors,
<br>
bankers, lawyers, and teachers has been well documented. But almost
<br>
no attention has been given to the part they played as freedom
<br>
fighters against the Soviets, or to their potential for armed
<br>
resistance against future oppressors who may again try to hijack the
<br>
country as the new government takes form. Yet the evidence indicates
<br>
that many Afghan women would fight to protect themselves and their
<br>
families.
<br>
<p>In October 1996, the New Internationalist magazine interviewed Nooria
<br>
Jehan, a mother who joined the anti-Soviet mujahideen in guerilla
<br>
warfare.
<br>
<p>&quot;I learned explosive techniques and began supervising and teaching
<br>
the younger men,&quot; Nooria recalled. &quot;We would stick explosives and
<br>
detonators under the Russians' tables and chairs.&quot;
<br>
<p>When asked what she would do if the women-hating Taliban captured her
<br>
city of residence, Kabul, Nooria said, &quot;We will fight them as we
<br>
fought the Russians.&quot;
<br>
<p>That is what some women have done. In the Nov. 12 Newsday,
<br>
journalists Matthew McAllester and Ilana Ozernoy quoted a woman named
<br>
Malika, a mother whose family lived on the Taliban front line of
<br>
Bagram just north of Kabul.
<br>
<p>&quot;At night I go up on the roof with my Kalashnikov [a Russian assault
<br>
rifle] and my hand grenades to protect my house,&quot; Malika declared.
<br>
<p>As the journalists commented, the very existence of Afghan women who
<br>
take up arms suggests &quot;a female population with more vitality and
<br>
self-confidence than is immediately apparent.&quot;
<br>
<p>Armed resistance is emerging as a sub-theme of women in Islam. The Iranian
<br>
artist Shirin Neshat captured this in her acclaimed photographic series
<br>
&quot;Women of Allah (1993-97).&quot; Neshat was born into Westernized Iran. Exiled
<br>
during the Islamic Revolution, she returned to a nation in which women were
<br>
silenced. From Neshat's black-and-white photographs, women stare defiantly
<br>
past their veils, some of them holding guns. The photographs challenge
<br>
people to rethink their assumptions about the impotence of Muslim women.
<br>
Women behind the veil have been underestimated.
<br>
<p>Yet, their feminist champions in America depict these women as unmitigated
<br>
victims who will not defend themselves. How can they ever be safe otherwise?
<br>
<p>Self-Defense
<br>
<p>The women of Afghanistan already know that the collapse of the
<br>
Taliban will not remove their need for self-defense. In an appeal to
<br>
the United Nations, the Revolutionary Association of the Women of
<br>
Afghanistan (RAWA) openly referred to the Northern Alliance as
<br>
&quot;looters and rapists.&quot; RAWA called factions of the alliance &quot;criminal
<br>
and inhuman.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is why feminists who champion Afghan women by dwelling
<br>
exclusively upon their victimization and helplessness are doing them
<br>
a disservice. It is the same feminist logic that cries out against
<br>
rape while promoting gun control laws that would leave women
<br>
defenseless. The opposite of victimization is empowerment.
<br>
<p>Afghan women must be able to defend themselves if their rights are to
<br>
be more than transitory. The solution may be as simple as the right
<br>
to buy a gun. Weapons are easily available in that region. Women may
<br>
need nothing more than the right to purchase a weapon - or the right
<br>
to accept arms and earmarked donations from pro-gun organizations.
<br>
Compassion for Afghan women and rage toward the Taliban is running so
<br>
high that donations marked for &quot;self-defense&quot; might well flow in the
<br>
same manner as donations for food and other relief - if such
<br>
donations are permitted to do so.
<br>
<p>Theresa Loar, president of Vital Voices Global Partnership, which
<br>
promotes women's global rights, declares, &quot;If we are going to go in
<br>
and rebuild Afghanistan and reverse the damage, we better not rely on
<br>
the guys with the guns to make the decisions.&quot;
<br>
<p>The best defense against &quot;guys with guns&quot; is women with guns. This is
<br>
especially true if the woman is alone in her home, protecting her
<br>
daughter from rape or her young son from being kidnapped into the
<br>
military.
<br>
<p>But feminists are not offering Afghan women this option. Eleanor
<br>
Smeal, president of the left-wing Feminist Majority Foundation, urges
<br>
instead that women play a key role in reconstituting Afghanistan's
<br>
future government. But history has shown us that this will not be
<br>
enough. In 1964, Afghanistan adopted a constitution that included
<br>
universal suffrage and equality for women. Women assumed roles in
<br>
both the government and the judiciary, and constituted some 30
<br>
percent of Afghanistan's civil service. But active participation in
<br>
government didn't prevent the Taliban from shrouding them in burqas.
<br>
The ability to defend themselves might have.
<br>
<p>Western forces cannot and should not patrol the streets of
<br>
Afghanistan to prevent violence against women. If these women are to
<br>
resume the Western advantages of having careers, freedom of speech
<br>
and representation in government, they must also assume the
<br>
responsibility of self-defense.
<br>
<p>There is a saying: Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach a
<br>
man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime. Give an Afghan woman the
<br>
right to own a gun and you protect her long after the current tragedy
<br>
has become old news. A gun in the hand of a mother who is protecting
<br>
her child may be the most humanitarian relief of all.
