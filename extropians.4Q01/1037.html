<em>&gt; 4 Cheers for space colonization, Colin. Although there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several bright people who see human space colonization as merely &quot;moving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apes into space&quot; and see uploaded, posthumans as a more reasonable
</em><br>
approach. I see the 21st
<br>
<em>&gt; century personality/memory upload as a technological wildcard. This
</em><br>
wildcard
<br>
<em>&gt; will almost certainly happen but happen later, in my view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So where to set up shop, Mars or the Asteroid Belt, L-5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Colonies, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moon? How will be fund this? Can we get better technology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly enough to make a difference in the human condition?
</em><br>
<p>At this stage I see it as an insurance policy with an attendant marketing
<br>
excercise. Heads have to be faced to the sky and know that's where we're
<br>
headed. I, too, do not believe that the creatures that head from Earth to
<br>
the stars will be humans as they are now. We're just too flimsy.
<br>
Innappropriate packaging. The journeys should be as natural as a walk in the
<br>
park to us future humans. Either that or the packaging should be
<br>
disposable/renewable. By the 'near vicinity' I regard as earth
<br>
orbit/moon/mars/asteroids.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile what has to happen, I believe, is that the present mindset of
<br>
regarding the exploration and habitation of our near vicinity as *optional*
<br>
when it comes to budget time, be eliminated. We could do with a little less
<br>
military and a little more focus on making access to space easy across a
<br>
range of fronts. From basic research to aerospace vehicle production. Here
<br>
in OZ, for example, we have a perfect place -and a history(woomera)- for
<br>
this kind of development - what happens? Beancounters and Lawyers and other
<br>
historians sail the ship of state towards a shopkeeper culture. This is
<br>
changing as the old guard die off - not quickly enough, however.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I should have classified urgency  - I mean 'generational' urgency.
<br>
Not geological urgency or car crash urgency. It is up to people like those
<br>
in this group to publicise the need. The urgency, I believe, comes from
<br>
items (please add/detract, as I'm sure you will!) like:
<br>
<p>1) We are overdue for serious vulcnism/tectonics events
<br>
2) We are overdue for a magnetic pole reversal.
<br>
3) We are about due for a medium sized asteroid/comet event.
<br>
4) We are about due for another ice age.
<br>
5) We exterminating species as if 1/3/4 were actually in progress.
<br>
6) We are messing with the environment/weather with unknown outcomes.
<br>
7) We are messing with DNA with unknown outcomes.
<br>
8) We are messing with our bacterial/viral environment with unknown
<br>
outcomes.
<br>
<p>I am a optimist, I think the future will be an even more amazing place than
<br>
now. I am also a realist and pragmatic enough to know when insurance makes
<br>
sense. And that is now.
