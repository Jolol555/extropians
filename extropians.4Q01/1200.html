After Technotranscendence published the following article the other
<br>
day I ordered the book:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mystery of Capital
<br>
&quot;Why capitalism triumphs in the west and fails everywhere else.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hernando De Soto

helping out disadvantaged countries/peoples.
<br>
<p>I'm going to bend the rules by reposting the excellent article.

<p><p>PERUVIAN EXCELS IN ANALYZING ECONOMIES WORLDWIDE
<br>
by Georgie Anne Geyer
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.uexpress.com/georgieannegeyer/viewgg.cfm">http://www.uexpress.com/georgieannegeyer/viewgg.cfm</a>
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON -- It may seem unlikely that a highly intellectual and
<br>
unusual Peruvian economist would have some of the long-term answers
<br>
to terrorism in the world. But Hernando de Soto, who has enlivened
<br>
economic thinking and challenged the misery of the developing world
<br>
for several decades now, truly has some original ideas.
<br>
<p>During his most recent visit to Washington, he and I had our third
<br>
talk in the past few months. Only this time, building on his years
<br>
of contacts with leaders and thinkers of the poorest countries of
<br>
the globe, de Soto had just come from three and a half hours with
<br>
the head of a faded superpower, Russian President Vladimir Putin.
<br>
<p>&quot;I told him that all capitalism is a legal framework,&quot; he said. &quot;If
<br>
you get it right, everything will fit together. But in fact, all
<br>
countries start out the same way. All countries start out with a
<br>
black market -- until property rights are established.
<br>
<p>&quot;So the first thing we do when we go into a country is 'measure it'
<br>
and tell the government where the problem is. It might be the
<br>
mafias, because then someone else is making the rules. We show them
<br>
how to go from a black market to a legal system.&quot;
<br>
<p>Was President Putin, the ex-KGB agent who has never been noted for
<br>
his economic prowess, willing or able to accept de Soto's formula?
<br>
&quot;Putin was terrific,&quot; de Soto said. &quot;He understands perfectly.
<br>
<p>&quot;I told him, 'I don't know Russia, but let me tell you throughout
<br>
history what Switzerland and Germany did to create a market
<br>
economy. They did a very sophisticated job of creating the proper
<br>
kinds of laws and on agreeing on who owns what.'
<br>
<p>&quot;When you talk with Putin and tell him that this is what the
<br>
Germans did decades ago, it begins to register. So Putin begins to
<br>
realize that you're saying the black market is not the result of
<br>
the Russian soul, but it's like smallpox: Everybody has had it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hernando de Soto works out of his Institute for Liberty and
<br>
Democracy in his hometown of Lima, Peru, an institute that has been
<br>
the bete noir of terrorists for years (the brutal Maoist Sendero
<br>
Luminoso bombed the offices in 1998, knowing full well where their
<br>
enemy lay).
<br>
<p>But in the last six years, he and his staff have moved further
<br>
afield, across the underdeveloped world, into poverty-stricken
<br>
countries or into moderately developing countries that are falling
<br>
behind because of overpopulation. One of those, on both accounts,
<br>
is Egypt.
<br>
<p>But, true to his insights into the economic life of societies, de
<br>
Soto found new facts to analyze in that teeming and increasingly
<br>
troubled society. Since Sept. 11, the government has been terrified
<br>
by the &quot;Arab street&quot; from taking a position on terrorism.
<br>
<p>&quot;In Egypt,&quot; he wrote in his new book, &quot;The Mystery of Capital,&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465016146/thefriedrhayeksc">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465016146/thefriedrhayeksc</a>
<br>
&quot;the wealth that the poor have accumulated is worth 55 times as
<br>
much as the sum of all direct foreign investment ever recorded
<br>
there, including the Suez Canal and the Aswan Dam.&quot; In fact, he was
<br>
already, at the time of the bombings, four and a half years into a
<br>
five-year in-depth analysis of the Egyptian economy, sponsored by
<br>
President Hosni Mubarak.
<br>
<p>Going beyond Egypt, &quot;by our calculations, the total value of the
<br>
real estate held but not legally owned by the poor of the Third
<br>
World and former communist nations is at least $9.3 trillion,&quot;
<br>
which is &quot;about twice as much as the total circulating U.S. money
<br>
supply,&quot; and &quot;very nearly as much as the total value of all the
<br>
companies listed on the main stock exchanges of the world's 20 most
<br>
developed countries.&quot;
<br>
<p>The trouble is that the &quot;mystery of capital,&quot; with its unique
<br>
capacity to regenerate societies by creating liberating wealth,
<br>
never has the chance to operate.
<br>
<p>As de Soto points out, this is because, whether in Egypt or
<br>
Indonesia or for that matter in George Washington's era in U.S.
<br>
history, &quot;They have houses but not titles, crops but not deeds,
<br>
businesses but not statutes of incorporation. And this is why many
<br>
countries seem to be modern, but aren't.&quot;
<br>
<p>They have adopted superficial products of capitalist society, but
<br>
not the &quot;representational forms&quot; underlying capitalist societies
<br>
and freeing capital in a &quot;vast hidden process that connects all the
<br>
assets to the rest of the economy&quot; and gives them a &quot;parallel life
<br>
in the creation of new assets.&quot;
<br>
<p>Painfully little of this complex but creative -- and comfortably
<br>
quantifiable -- process is present today in the Arab and Islamic
<br>
world (whose banks spurn interest, for example). Only 4 percent of
<br>
the investment moneys of the world go into the Middle East,
<br>
including Israel. No wonder, then, that teams of violent youth
<br>
haunt the mountains of Afghanistan and the streets of Cairo and
<br>
Djakarta.
<br>
<p>Not much can be done, of course, in terms of the economic
<br>
reconstruction of developing countries while this &quot;war on
<br>
terrorism&quot; is at its height. But in the long run, if the countries
<br>
of the world are to stabilize, the original and practical ideas of
<br>
this remarkable thinker are surely the place to begin.
