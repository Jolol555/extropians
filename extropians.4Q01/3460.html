</em><br>
<p>I think they usually don't know either of them :-) Remember, we are now
<br>
talking about second hand ethics, where people use ethics as a bludgeon
<br>
in the debate but seldom do any ethical reasoning.
<br>
<p>Yes, if you view the stem cells or blastocyst as persons then it is not
<br>
right to use them. And plenty of opponents in the pro-life camp seem to
<br>
hold this cellocentric view. But what I was discussing in the paragraph
<br>
above are the anti-cloning proponents that fear that cloning will make
<br>
us more into means and less into ends. I don't know how Kant would
<br>
handle issues like that, and maybe my consequentialist handling above is
<br>
entirely contrary to his thinking, but it seems that fears that
<br>
perceptions of human value would move in a less desirable direction are
<br>
not valid ethical reasons in Kantian ethics either?
