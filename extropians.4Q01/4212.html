<em>&gt; Sincerely, I hate to bring this subject up again, but it has been running

</em><br>
<p><p>I am not sure I consider the question all that relevant. 
<br>
Increasing the number of intelligent beings or moving such
<br>
intelligence around in time or space seems like generally a good
<br>
thing to me whether or not I consider a &quot;copy&quot; to be &quot;me&quot;.  And
<br>
it seems a generally good thing if a being very much like &quot;me&quot;
<br>
is around for longer than this body might hold up. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I was wondering if, perhaps, someone can enlighten me on the fallacies of my
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner in which I may end up surviving bodily death and that hopefully it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will indeed be 'me' and not a copy of me.  
</em><br>
<p>I think you will have the devil's own job attempting to come up
<br>
with a reasonably tight and useful definition of just what
<br>
constitutes &quot;you&quot;.  It might be that the worry is unimportant
<br>
because what you consider &quot;you&quot; is not of as much substance as
<br>
you believe it to be. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; But people on this list feel that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 'copy' of me is actually indistinguishable from me, or IS me.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to learn as much as I can about this position, as I am striving to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out what the most likely and simplest explanation for observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena is.  If the heart of this argument can be relayed to me, perhaps I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be able to feel solace in a copy of me surviving.  Thanks for your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; input.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>There are two main possible positions that I see:
<br>
a) there is some extra something that makes you &quot;you&quot; that does
<br>
not get copied and/or transferred in copying;
<br>
b) there is no such extra something.
<br>
<p>So your position seems to require some variant of (a).  Is that
<br>
correct?  Definitely if we assume the copy is deep enough then
<br>
the copy will experience itself just as if it was &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;You&quot;
<br>
awakening in the copy would not consider yourself to not have
<br>
been at all any more than you consider yourself to not have been
<br>
when you wake up from sleep or anathesia.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So far, the only arguments I have identified that argues against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'continuity of consciousness' argument is the 'how do I know it hasn't
</em><br>
