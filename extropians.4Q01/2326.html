</em><br>
<p>I define freedom as access to choices. Being freedom-loving means
<br>
valuing other people's access to choices, and therefore not trying to   
<br>
restrict their range of choices unless necessary to serve a great good. 
<br>
Here restrict means not just physically prevent a choice, but also making
<br>
the consequences of that choice less pleasant.
<br>
<p>I would defend the extropian enterprise this way. The current lifestyles
<br>
are not self-sustaining or self-sustainable, thus the choice of remaining 
<br>
in those lifestyles is not available anyway. What we're trying to do is
<br>
achieve a lifestyle, for ourselves and others, that does offer the
<br>
greatest range of choices, compared to the alternatives that are possible.
