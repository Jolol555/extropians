<em>&gt; Ah, but this is a bit incomplete. I refer you to Article 1V of the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Constitution, primarily Sections 1 and 2 which deal with the 'Full faith
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and credit' and 'privileges and immunities' clauses. These are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lynchpins of the bank of trust that the citizenship has in their fellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no basis for a government requiring that a person get a permit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to exercise their natural human rights, as those rights exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrespective of the existence of that government. However, under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'full faith and credit' clause, Congress is empowered to regulate how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the federal and state governments are to determine who is and is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen residing in the several states.
</em><br>
<p>Such determination is really, from the point of view of natural rights,
<br>
irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While being a citizen or not is irrelevant to an individuals basic human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights, it is highly relevant to whether one can exercise the privileges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and immunities of being a citizen. A citizen, for example, is immune to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deportation, while a non-citizen is not. Being able to operate dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment, like a motorized automobile, an aircraft, or a steamship, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a privilege that citizens must pass a threshold of qualifications to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold. Being able to carry a concealed weapon is considered in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states to be a privilege that only citizens can have (while otherse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider it a right that only citizens have).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, all these things you note are just there because of government
<br>
interference with the natural order.  If roads, waterways, and airways were
<br>
privatized, there would be no need for government regulation of any of
<br>
these.  The owners of them would decide who gets to operate what on them and
<br>
would pay the penalties for any damage to other people's property because of
<br>
any negligent or wreckless management.
<br>
<p>As for deportation, again, if the government did not interfere with private
<br>
property, the owners of such property would decide who to invite and who not
<br>
to invite onto their property.  Immigration would then be a matter of mutual
<br>
consent -- not government policy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The difficulty is delineating between rights and privileges. Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we live in a free society does not mean that every action is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right. Essentially you could lay the boundary at the line between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swinging one's fist and hitting another's nose. Being able to smack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else in the snoot is a privilege that you can obtain only with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the permission of the snoot-holder. It isn't your right. Being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollute is a privilege you can obtain via the permission and payment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fees to the elected/appointed representatives of the rest of the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who's surroundings you pollute. It isn't your right.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that there is no right to destroy another's property, BUT this does
<br>
not make government a legitimate representative of the property rights of
<br>
others.  Pollution, e.g., should be handled by the polluting either getting
<br>
consent or getting taken to [a private] court.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, placing increased risk of injury and/or death on others by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating dangerous equipment demands permission to exercise a privilege
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the sole exception being that equipment covered under the 2nd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amendment).
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, Article IV only covers the rights, privileges, and immunities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of citizens of states of the Union. It recognises no rights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-citizens, therefore it is the Congress' job to impose some means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowing the reliable determination of which group an individual belongs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to, so as to allow the individual to be treated in the proper legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner as befits their status as a citizen or non-citizen.
</em><br>
<p>That is the Constitution, but it is not the natural order -- the order of
<br>
individual natural rights.  In the natural order, governments don't count.
<br>
Citizenship doesn't count.  The proof of whether someone belongs in a given
<br>
area is whether she or he owns that area or is invited by the owner of that
<br>
area.  (In the case of unowned areas, there is no need for proof.  Public
<br>
property creates a problem here, but the goal then should be to privatize
<br>
public property -- in most cases, returning it to its rightful owners.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
