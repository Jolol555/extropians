Practical Life Extension, 1.3, A Quick and Dirty 
<br>
Introduction to Life Extension
<br>
<p>I started writing this essay fifteen years ago and it's not 
<br>
finished yet but I don't know when it will be finished so I 
<br>
will share a it with you now in the hopes that it will be 
<br>
of some help.  I am trying to make most of these essays 
<br>
clear and simple but I will leave this one fairly rough.  
<br>
This is what life extension is like for me.
<br>
<p>It is challenging to predict the future.  It is hard to 
<br>
understand the world and all of the risks facing us.  As I 
<br>
write about life extension and try to plan my own life I 
<br>
look at the many ways people can die or be disabled and I 
<br>
wonder where to start working.  For myself I have chosen to 
<br>
be a generalist and keep looking at all of the major 
<br>
problems and trying to understand how they interrelate and 
<br>
what can be done about them.   With that brief background I 
<br>
will start digging into various aspects of life extension 
<br>
so that you can get a feel for it before I go on to discuss 
<br>
particular areas in detail.
<br>
<p>Aging:  We are all aging.  Historically aging kills 
<br>
everyone if something else does not kill them first.  If we 
<br>
want to live a long time the problem of aging must be 
<br>
solved.  Science is moving ahead.  Each year we understand 
<br>
a bit more about how bodies work and what can be done to 
<br>
improve their functioning.  I do not know how long it will 
<br>
be before aging is slowed or reversed.  For old people the 
<br>
problem is coming up soon.  For young people it is much 
<br>
further off.  How soon the problem is solved will be 
<br>
affected by how many people work on it.  To some extent the 
<br>
problem of aging depends on progress in science in general 
<br>
and especially biological and biomedical science.  Aging is 
<br>
the core problem of life extension.  It will get you sooner 
<br>
or latter (within about 100 years in any case, sooner if 
<br>
you have been around a while) unless something is done to 
<br>
better understand and deal with the problem of aging.
<br>
<p>There may already be some things you can do to slow aging.  
<br>
Caloric restriction with good nutrition may work (I'll get 
<br>
into it more later).  Some drugs may help but the evidence 
<br>
is not good.  General health measures can add about five 
<br>
years to your life on average.  Avoiding bad habits can add 
<br>
another five years or more.  Cryonics (being frozen when 
<br>
near death) may allow for eventual treatment of whatever 
<br>
ails you.  I think of aging as mostly an old persons 
<br>
problem but if you can find a method of anti-aging which 
<br>
will work for you, the sooner you begin it the longer you 
<br>
will have for science to figure out more of the puzzle.  It 
<br>
is uncertain when science will figure out the problems of 
<br>
aging and a few years or decades might make the difference.
<br>
<p>Endogenous (internal) diseases (heart diseases, cancer, 
<br>
stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's, etc.) are the top killers of 
<br>
people in developed countries.  They start to be the top 
<br>
killers around fifty years old and become more common over 
<br>
the decades until they completely overshadow all other 
<br>
causes of death.  These diseases are closely associated 
<br>
with age and aging.  Their prevention, treatment and cure 
<br>
is primarily a scientific and biomedical problem.  There 
<br>
are things that individuals can do to lessen their own 
<br>
risks and there are things that can be done to treat the 
<br>
diseases.  I tend to group endogenous diseases and aging 
<br>
under the same biomedical research umbrella.
<br>
<p>Health is closely related to aging and endogenous diseases.  
<br>
Some health measures do extend your life.  Good medical 
<br>
testing and care can help you avoid dying from diseases in 
<br>
many cases.  Another reason to consider health is to up 
<br>
your productivity and quality of life.  Beyond those things 
<br>
that are clearly shown to decrease risk of death or 
<br>
disability what I look for from &quot;healthy&quot; behaviors is an 
<br>
increase in my productivity or my enjoyment of life.  If 
<br>
something is not scientifically proven to give benefits and 
<br>
it has no clear and noticeable effect, what's the point?
<br>
<p>Exogenous (external) diseases are the top killers in the 
<br>
world.  They mostly kill poor people in underdeveloped 
<br>
countries.  Malaria, AIDS, etc.  People in these countries 
<br>
are poorly feed, live in crowded conditions, have poor 
<br>
sanitation, etc.  Overcrowded areas with unhealthy people 
<br>
make great breading grounds for diseases.  I will not get 
<br>
into this much right now I have not studied it carefully 
<br>
but these are the top killers in the world.  In the future 
<br>
new diseases may develop which bring the plague of 
<br>
contagious diseases back to developed countries but I hope 
<br>
science manages to stay ahead of it.
<br>
<p>War, organized group violence, also has a great potential 
<br>
for killing.  Historically wars have brought down many 
<br>
great civilizations.  Wars increase disease (most people 
<br>
die from diseases in wars).  The trends have been for wars 
<br>
to kill more and more people over time with a higher number 
<br>
of civilian casualties.  A major nuclear war could kill a 
<br>
lot of people.  People concentrated in cities would be the 
<br>
most vulnerable targets.  The first targets have tended to 
<br>
be military targets but as wars go on, the industrial 
<br>
facilities become attractive targets.  Do not assume that 
<br>
nuclear bombs are the worst of it.  War encourages 
<br>
innovation and weapons of even more destructive capability 
<br>
may be developed.  Biological weapons are one possibility.  
<br>
It may be possible for a small group (terrorists) to kill 
<br>
many people but I doubt they are that clever (if they were 
<br>
they might pick another profession).  On going cold wars, 
<br>
with less obvious attempts to weaken the opposition or gain 
<br>
advantage could also be a problem but if no one is being 
<br>
killed or getting hurt why worry about it.
<br>
<p>Oppression, is also a problem, the adverse and unnecessary 
<br>
control of some people by other people.  Oppression has 
<br>
been quite deadly in some countries at some times.  Stalin, 
<br>
Mao, Hitler, etc. killed tens of millions of people 
<br>
directly and many more with bad policies.   If some 
<br>
government or other large organized group puts your life in 
<br>
danger or significantly lessens your opportunities to 
<br>
thrive and you have done little to bring it on yourself 
<br>
that is oppression.  I think in most of the developed 
<br>
world, not already suffering greatly from oppression, such 
<br>
problems can be kept in check or reversed but it does 
<br>
require attention and effort.  There are groups of people 
<br>
in the world who will attempt to harm you or adversely 
<br>
control you either because they want to hurt you, don't 
<br>
care, or mean well.  Either way it is your job to pay 
<br>
attention and try to counter such efforts.
<br>
<p>For the individual the first and simplest answers to war, 
<br>
and oppression (and perhaps contagious diseases) is 
<br>
mobility and awareness.  If you avoid the most oppressive 
<br>
areas and stay away from places likely to be the first hit 
<br>
in military action you can keep moving away from problems.  
<br>
If you can do something about the problems without getting 
<br>
hurt, I encourage you to stay and do so but your first 
<br>
responsibility is to stay alive (and help others stay 
<br>
alive) so that you can continue to help (and enjoy your 
<br>
life).
<br>
<p>Awareness is useful in many ways.  In the case of wars and 
<br>
oppression awareness means following the news and trying to 
<br>
understand what is going on in the world militarily and 
<br>
politically that is likely to affect you dramatically, 
<br>
immediately or over time.  This requires an understanding 
<br>
of history, discussion and study of current events, etc.  
<br>
Since this is one of my own top concerns I will get into it 
<br>
much more fully later.
<br>
<p>Mobility is the companion to awareness.  Learning how to 
<br>
travel well (and bring others along), having places to go.  
<br>
Learning how to travel even under adverse circumstances.  
<br>
To an extent and as you are able I think it is important to 
<br>
learn to do well in somewhat dangerous (military and 
<br>
political) environments, so that you will know how to 
<br>
handle yourself if you are thrust into such environments 
<br>
unexpectedly.  But for starters just learning to move 
<br>
around the country and around the world in various 
<br>
different ways is good.  Learning other languages can help.  
<br>
Making friends in various parts of the world can help.  
<br>
Learning how to make new friends quickly is also a valuable 
<br>
skill.
<br>
<p>Mobility is also good if you want to study things like 
<br>
aging, diseases, or other sciences with some of the most 
<br>
knowledgeable people in the world.  Travel can give you 
<br>
first hand experience with death, poverty, war, etc. and 
<br>
that may serve as a motivation and offer some perspective.  
<br>
Travel can also offer a better understanding of comparative 
<br>
politics.  Travel will test your efficiency and build your 
<br>
adaptability. 
<br>
<p>Accidents kill mostly young people and old people.  The 
<br>
young people because they lack experience and behave 
<br>
recklessly and old people because they start to loose their 
<br>
abilities and become more brittle.  Transportation 
<br>
accidents cause the most deaths.  Accidents at work and at 
<br>
home are also common.  Old people die from falls a lot.  
<br>
Some jobs, mining, forestry, etc. have more fatalities than 
<br>
others.  Accidents can be reduced significantly by caution, 
<br>
awareness, training and good equipment.  Good emergency 
<br>
medical care also helps.
<br>
<p>Violence is a problem some places more than others.  Young 
<br>
inner city black men often die from violence in the United 
<br>
States.  Different areas of the world have different levels 
<br>
of violence.  Different neighborhoods have different levels 
<br>
of violence.  Where you live, work and travel will affect 
<br>
how much violence you encounter.  Awareness helps.  
<br>
Learning to manage your own temper and to avoid contentious 
<br>
situations helps.  Avoid violent relationships.  Martial 
<br>
arts and firearms skills can help you if you ever get 
<br>
attacked or need to defend someone else.  If you learn how 
<br>
to defend yourself and others you will be free to roam over 
<br>
more of the world safely.  Combat skills can come in handy 
<br>
in war, riots, etc.  Unless you really know what you are 
<br>
doing or you have no choice, running away is usually the 
<br>
best option but sometimes there is no good way to get 
<br>
yourself or others away from harm and staying and fighting 
<br>
is the answer.
<br>
<p>Disasters seem like such a small problem compared to other 
<br>
things but they do kill people here and there.  People die 
<br>
from disasters more often in poor countries with poorer 
<br>
construction.  Scientist try to track and understand 
<br>
natural disasters.  Sometimes man made disasters 
<br>
(accidents) also kill many people.  Someday a big asteroid 
<br>
may make a mess of everything.  It would probably take a 
<br>
bigger asteroid to wipe out humans than dinosaurs because 
<br>
we are so creative but something could kill much of 
<br>
humanity and that would be a disaster.  Getting into space 
<br>
and colonizing other planets would spread out the risk form 
<br>
asteroids, wars, etc.
<br>
<p>Poverty is another big problem.  Poor people die more 
<br>
easily.  This is a bootstrapping problem.  Some areas are 
<br>
crowded without the infrastructure necessary to support so 
<br>
many people, not enough food, bad sanitation, etc.  
<br>
Figuring out how to help so many people create the basics 
<br>
they need to live and thrive in the world is a challenging 
<br>
puzzle.  Figuring this puzzle out would create a lot of 
<br>
human resources, which could be channeled into any number 
<br>
of worthwhile projects.  It would also save a lot of lives.  
<br>
The more people there are in the world who have things like 
<br>
aging as their biggest problem the faster such problems 
<br>
will get solved.  In the mean time poverty is the problem 
<br>
that the most people die from every day.
<br>
<p>Intelligence is one of the top solutions to all of these 
<br>
problems.  The smarter you are the faster you can figure 
<br>
things out.  There is a lot to figure out so if you can 
<br>
find ways to up your intelligence that is a good place to 
<br>
start.  Improving the biology of your brain can increase 
<br>
intelligence.  Maybe some chemicals will help.  Better 
<br>
algorithms for solving problems and learning can make huge 
<br>
differences to the rate and accuracy of our thinking.  
<br>
Learning, reasoning, creativity, organization, planning, 
<br>
productivity, all of these things can be improved by better 
<br>
algorithms. 
<br>
<p>Tools: Computers, programs, sensory equipment, and tools 
<br>
specific to the various life extension activities can make 
<br>
huge differences to the chances of success.  Various 
<br>
furniture, gear, possessions, etc. can help you more 
<br>
efficiently and effectively pursue your life extension 
<br>
goals.  A lot of junk and clutter can also get in your way 
<br>
and waste time.
<br>
<p>Knowledge is important.  If we knew a lot more the whole 
<br>
problem of life extension would be trivial.  Learning about 
<br>
each of the aspects of life extension and the main ways of 
<br>
solving the problems of life extension is a primary 
<br>
concern.  It's no good to be do one part well and die from 
<br>
something else.  To really solve these problems will take a 
<br>
lot of experts but it is important to know a bit about the 
<br>
whole field and each of the key elements, if you do not 
<br>
want to get blind sided.  Since knowledge is so important 
<br>
learning how to learn is an especially important thing to 
<br>
learn.
<br>
<p>Skills are the applied side of knowledge.  Knowledge and 
<br>
skills are encoded in neurons in the brain.  They are two 
<br>
different types of knowledge.  Once you know things and 
<br>
develop your skills I trust you will apply them.  Good 
<br>
tools, programs, collaboration, etc. can partially replace 
<br>
knowledge and skills.
<br>
<p>Collaboration is one of the most effective ways to expand 
<br>
your own capabilities.  The field of life extension is too 
<br>
vast for any person to master independently given our 
<br>
current state of knowledge.  You must work with other 
<br>
people if you are to survive in this world.  The more 
<br>
effective you are at working with other people and the more 
<br>
capable and ethically compatible the people you work with 
<br>
are, the faster it will all go.
<br>
<p>Ethics and values are the real problem in the world.  
<br>
People do not care enough about living and about helping 
<br>
other people to live (for my taste).  They are still busy 
<br>
pursuing various outdated genetic goals, cultural advice 
<br>
from centuries ago, etc.  There are many things a person 
<br>
can reasonably value but I believe most or many people do 
<br>
value their own life and the lives of others and just have 
<br>
not thought about it much.  Once you figure out what you 
<br>
value, getting it can be difficult and time consuming but 
<br>
you have a much better chance than someone who does not 
<br>
know or think about what they really want.  If most people 
<br>
were clear that they wanted to live indefinitely and wanted 
<br>
to help other people to stay alive also (with a few 
<br>
exceptions) I do not think it would take very long or be 
<br>
very hard to work out the technical and social problems of 
<br>
life extension.  The big problem is that not enough people 
<br>
are focused on such goals and many people act in ways 
<br>
directly opposed to them.
<br>
<p>The quality of relationships is important.  Relationships 
<br>
can support you when you have problems.  Staying alive is 
<br>
partially a matter of maintaining equilibrium.  Sometimes 
<br>
people move so far in some direction (car accident, 
<br>
illness, enemies, etc.) that they will die without 
<br>
intervention from others.  Having people in your life who 
<br>
have a personal interest in your survival can help you 
<br>
through such situations.  Good relationship skills and good 
<br>
people skills will make collaborations go much smoother.  
<br>
It is useful to know how to get along with people you meet 
<br>
and it is useful to know how to maintain and improve 
<br>
relationships with people you already know.
<br>
<p>Wealth and resources can also be of some value.  People 
<br>
will work for money.  You can buy gear with money.  You can 
<br>
buy training with money.  You can buy information with 
<br>
money.  There are many times when some physical object will 
<br>
help you stay alive.  Medical care cost money.  Homes can 
<br>
facilitate your work.  Cars, planes, etc. can help you get 
<br>
around.  Medical research requires equipment.  With money 
<br>
you can buy gear and tools which allow you to work faster 
<br>
and better, people to help you work, etc.  How to make 
<br>
money is one of the best understood things in Western 
<br>
society.  Try not to get trapped focusing on the money 
<br>
though.  It is the things money buy that are valuable and 
<br>
you can save a lot of effort by focusing on what you want 
<br>
and thinking of money as one pathway to it.  You can also 
<br>
save a lot of time by starting to save and invest early and 
<br>
making use of compound interest to grow your assets.  There 
<br>
is a trade off between using money to make money and using 
<br>
money to improve other things in your life.  Just as 
<br>
important as the amount of money is your ability to make 
<br>
good use of a given amount of money.  Developing some 
<br>
widely valued money making skills can also be helpful if 
<br>
you ever loose your pile and need to start over.
<br>
<p>Try asking what is the best thing I can do with the next 
<br>
segment of time and what is the best thing I can do with a 
<br>
given chunk of money.  What are the easiest ways to get a 
<br>
given life extension project done?  How can you get help?  
<br>
What tools would help?  What do you need to know?  Who 
<br>
could you ask?  How can you get started or explore the 
<br>
area?  What are the risks involved?  What experiments can 
<br>
you use to test your ideas or find out some information?  
<br>
Who are the best people to spend time with next?  What are 
<br>
the most worthwhile things to do with them?  Etc.
<br>
<p>Efficiency is all about getting things done as quickly and 
<br>
well as possible.  If you look at the big picture of 
<br>
efficiency and have well chosen goals it is hard to argue 
<br>
with efficiency.   Being efficient at one task can create 
<br>
problems in other areas if you are not careful.  Usually 
<br>
such problems involve people.  People are active agents and 
<br>
you want to be a little careful about what sort of 
<br>
responses you trigger in them.  When there are people 
<br>
around pay some attention to them and how you are getting 
<br>
along with them.  That being said most people can do things 
<br>
a lot faster and better than they do.  Keeping in mind the 
<br>
task of doing as well as you can most of the time (it being 
<br>
efficient to think other ways sometimes) can do a lot to 
<br>
speed you along your way.  There are lots of efficiency 
<br>
tricks in all sorts of fields and many people know them.
<br>
<p>Attitude and psychology are important for life extension.  
<br>
Often the key element in accomplishing something is 
<br>
starting and not giving up.  Flexibility of methods can 
<br>
speed that process along.  Humans often have trouble doing 
<br>
what they know makes sense.  Sometimes what they know isn't 
<br>
so.  Intelligence, the way we think, is a sub-field of 
<br>
psychology, how we think right and how we think wrong.  
<br>
Psychology deals with your own mind and the minds of 
<br>
others.  Part of the challenge is to get your mind in line 
<br>
with reality.  It is also very helpful to learn ways of 
<br>
thinking which simplify reality and allow you to short cut 
<br>
a lot of time spent reasoning, provided those short cuts 
<br>
provide the right answers in most cases and in every 
<br>
critical case.  Along with attitude is your basic 
<br>
biochemical makeup.  The mind influences the body and the 
<br>
body influences the mind.
<br>
<p>Technology:  Some people think some technologies will be 
<br>
developed soon which will so change the world that most 
<br>
everything else will become unimportant (or solved) in 
<br>
comparison.  Nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, 
<br>
genetic engineering, and human intelligence, are some of 
<br>
the technologies that may so change the world.  These 
<br>
technologies may change the world positively or negatively.  
<br>
They are levers for affecting life and death.  AI could 
<br>
replace humans, augment humans, or serve humans.  All of 
<br>
these technologies may make good and bad things happen more 
<br>
quickly.  Technology in general will play a big part in the 
<br>
future and how it turns out.
<br>
<p>Okay, that is a quick and dirty introduction to the field 
<br>
of life extension and most of the important sub topics.  My 
<br>
later writings will look at each of these topics in greater 
<br>
detail.
<br>
<p>My own top concern at this time is organized group violence 
<br>
and oppression.  As a healthy middle aged person, living a 
<br>
comfortable life in a developed country aging, diseases, 
<br>
accidents, personal violence, disasters, and poverty are 
<br>
not much of a threat to me.  A major war seems like the 
<br>
thing, which has the greatest chance of happening in the 
<br>
next few years which could greatly perturb my life.  Aging 
<br>
is the most likely problem but it is so far off and shows 
<br>
promise of being figured out in my life time.  I have 
<br>
studied biology and science a lot.  I am comfortable with 
<br>
biological sciences.  Human conflict is more of a mystery 
<br>
to me so if I am to have a balanced understanding of the 
<br>
threats I face developing a better understanding of human 
<br>
conflict seems like a good choice.  I don't know what else 
<br>
might kill 100 million people next week.
<br>
<p>Once aging, diseases, accidents, and disasters are ancient 
<br>
history we may still have problems with violent human 
<br>
conflict.  A peaceful outlook, well developed combat 
<br>
skills, and some care in selecting the places you frequent 
<br>
can do a lot to protect you from personal violence.  Wars 
<br>
and oppression on the other hand involve organized groups 
<br>
of other humans who may be quite bright and determined.  It 
<br>
may be possible to side step them and stay out of their way 
<br>
or it may be possible to work with others to control the 
<br>
worst of them but I don't see this as a problem one can 
<br>
ignore.
<br>
<p>Still there are many ways to go on the path to life 
<br>
extension.  I am fortunate to have no major risks at the 
<br>
moment.  Any of the fields I have discussed are worthy of 
<br>
effort by people interested in life extension.  I do not 
<br>
think there is one best path.  There are simply a lot of 
<br>
problems to solve.  Few enough though that I am starting to 
<br>
feel like I understand what it takes to stay alive 
<br>
indefinitely.  There may be some things I have missed but I 
<br>
feel like I pretty much have it all in my head at this 
<br>
point. I think my world is likely to get less complicated 
<br>
not more complicated from my personal perspective as I go 
<br>
after each major area of risk in succession.
<br>
<p>I decided to write these things down (even in a rough and 
<br>
unfinished form) partially because I want to make friends, 
<br>
and partially because I want feedback, assistance and 
<br>
people to collaborate with.  Also, I am starting to write 
<br>
now because, on the off chance I die or am injured in some 
<br>
way, I do not want the fifteen years I have spent thinking 
<br>
about these things to be lost to others.  I also have a 
<br>
profit motive down the road but I'm not so sure doing all 
<br>
of this writing for free helps that cause.
