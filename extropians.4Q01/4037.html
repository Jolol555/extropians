<p>I don't think anyone's disagreeing with you.  However, there's
<br>
a cost-value proposition you're ignoring, or at least appear
<br>
to be ignoring.
<br>
<p>Exercising judgement requires effort.  Effort isn't cheap -- who
<br>
has the time?  Those who do should volunteer their time and effort
<br>
to ExI.  Then, that volunteer that is willing to dedicate time and
<br>
effort to policing the mailing list can then offer judgement, and
<br>
also get singled out and blamed when the consenus is that poor
<br>
judgement was made.
<br>
<p>In the long run, it's more cost effective to simply create a
<br>
no-tolerance rule for ad hominem.
<br>
<p>If you disagree (that it's not cost effective) then perhaps
<br>
you could explain why you feel that way?
<br>
<p>Me, personally, I'll kill-file messages from people who I don't
<br>
care to hear from regardless of their subscription to mailing
<br>
lists I'm on; I can't be bothered to try and get a position with
<br>
authority to remove them from the list.  Perhaps if others
<br>
were as self-enabling, perhaps a rule like this wouldn't even
<br>
be necessary.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this off-topic discussion should be taken offline,
<br>
before someone exercises the zero-tolerance for off-topic
<br>
conversation rule, which I'd probably be the first to
<br>
violate, anyhow ...
