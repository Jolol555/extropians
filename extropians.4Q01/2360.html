I shouldn't publically write when I'm emotional or angry, but here goes.

<p><em>&gt;War Support Ebbs Worldwide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By Kevin Sullivan
</em><br>
<p>No kidding. The demonstrators in front of the Deutsche-American
<br>
Institute in Heidelberg last weekend didn't look too happy either.
<br>
<p>You might ask the Americans living abroad what other countries think
<br>
of the U.S. Governemnt's meddling (the Americans living abroad are the
<br>
ones who directly most often experience the consequences)
<br>
<p>Even before I moved away from the U.S., I found extremeley stifling
<br>
many Americans attitudes that the U.S. is the center of the Universe.
<br>
It is not.
<br>
<p>Smarter people don't think that way, but that was unfortunately not the
<br>
mainstream attitude. And it's unfortunately not the typical attitude
<br>
of (average) Americans who travel abroad or the Americans who think
<br>
about foreigners while at home (if or when they do).
<br>
<p>I don't think that it is the &quot;American way&quot; to push the &quot;American way&quot;
<br>
onto people who don't want it. Nor do I think that it is the U.S.
<br>
government's resonsibility to be world policemen. But that's almost
<br>
all I see on this list these days.
<br>
<p>There are many ways to help other people and countries in trouble,
<br>
however I've not seen the U.S. Government practice very many of those.
<br>
There are indeed respectful ways that to treat other cultures, but I've
<br>
not seen the U.S. Government practice very many of those, either.
<br>
<p>I'd much rather support my practice of being a human living on
<br>
this planet Earth with the other humans.
<br>
<p>sorry for the angry outburst, but this list just pushed me over.
