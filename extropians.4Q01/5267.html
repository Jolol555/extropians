<em>&gt; Depending on the lot size of course.
</em><br>
<p>Depending more on where the lot is located.
<br>
A quarter acre downtown is a bit pricier than one out in the tules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In estimating the value of a house in Santa Clara, the actual size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the house does not matter much, only the size of the lot it sits on.
</em><br>
<p>That's because land is much more expensive in Santa Clara than in less
<br>
populous areas, and also because developers can subdivide a large lot,
<br>
demolish the old house that was on it, and build more saleable new houses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This was especially true during the recent boom, since all the newly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minted dot com jillionaires intended to tear down the house anyway, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build something else.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly... and when they get tired of Santa Clara, they often discover that
<br>
their jillions can buy much more house, and incredibly more land, in some
<br>
rural areas such as Shasta county. As a bonus, they don't have all that city
<br>
traffic to fight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Under those conditions a bigger house would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually decrease the value of the property, since it would be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trash to haul off.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's right, a big lot (with a small house) is a primary concern for
<br>
anyone who wants to build a nice, new house in the Santa Clara area. Out here
<br>
in Shasta county, that's not the way it works, because there is plenty of
<br>
vacant land to build on, and so, small lots near town are worth much more than
<br>
big lots out in the sticks.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,

non-sensory experience, SETI

<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
