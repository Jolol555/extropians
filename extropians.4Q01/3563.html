<p>Harvey, I think this is one of the most central things about Extropy, and that
<br>
it why it has been all over this list, and will continue to be so.  You, also,
<br>
wonder how is it that symmetry is broken such that you seem to be who, where and
<br>
when you are, and not someone else, somewhere else, and at somewhen else.  If
<br>
this &quot;index problem&quot; is not an illusion (as Zen masters indicate), where does it
<br>
come from?  What physical thing makes me wake up as me?
<br>
<p>If I write a sim world on my computer, I can instantiate as many identities as I
<br>
have storage and cycles to handle.  While these are running around in the works,
<br>
I, as the Microcosmic God, can go in with the debugger and look at the internal
<br>
state of any of my creatures, and see that the accumulated state variables
<br>
represent a unique view based on initial conditions.  If I record the changes in
<br>
state, I could make a movie of the sim world experience of being creature index
<br>
(i).  From this view, creature(i) may be advanced enough to wonder why it does
<br>
not experience the world as creature(i+1).  From its viewpoint, creature(i) may
<br>
be a 'me' and have a separate 'life', but from my viewpoint it is the total
<br>
simulation that exists, and fact that the creatures cannot see this is what
<br>
keeps them from a vastly greater sense of themselves.
