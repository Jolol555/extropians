<em>&gt;I'm sorry that you didn't make it the Extro conference this year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brian.  You would have seen Mark Miller highlight this book in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presentation.  What may or may not have been obvious in his talk is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that Mark's present focus of his work is to implement some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspects from this book (as well as his own related ideas).
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Mark's description of de Soto's ideas was somewhat biased by the
<br>
solutions that Mark is trying to sell. Mark has a good anarchocapitalist
<br>
idea for how to securely transfer property rights.
<br>
&nbsp;That may solve part of the problem that de Soto describes, but the evidence
<br>
that de Soto presents strongly suggests that a more fundamental part of the
<br>
problem is that landowners cannot keep their property without continuously
<br>
occupying it. Enabling banks to take title to a piece of land won't help much
<br>
if the bank needs to send an employee to house-sit until they can sell it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is difficult for libertarians to tell people 10 years after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Fall of Communism&quot; why those people's (in former communist countries)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lives are not significantly better now. For me personally it's sad,
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;De Soto may have identified the most important problem facing the
<br>
typical poor person in latin america, but that appears to be only
<br>
a small part of the problems that face nations that are trying to
<br>
recover from the effects of Stalinism.
<br>
&nbsp;Mancur Olson's book Power and Prosperity does a better job of describing
<br>
the worst problems afflicting formerly communist nations (and provides a
<br>
few hints about why China is recovering much faster than Russia). The degree
<br>
to which communism eliminated the use of market prices for resource allocation
<br>
meant that over a period of decades, much of the Soviet industry became
<br>
not merely inefficient, but came to actually subtract value from the
<br>
economy. He reports the surprising observation that many newly started
<br>
Russian enterprises categorically refuse to hire anyone who has worked
<br>
for a state enterprise in the same industry. Apparently the skills that
<br>
those workers have learned make them worth less than unskilled workers
<br>
in a free market, and those state enterprises only remain in business
<br>
because of their lobbying skills.
<br>
&nbsp;This is a very different effect from the more normal problem of the
<br>
government distorting market prices, which prevents some desirable
<br>
transactions from happening, but generally doesn't prevent the most
<br>
valuable economic transactions or produce activities that subtract
<br>
value from the economy.
<br>
&nbsp;Olson's book also includes an interesting argument that Stalin's actions
<br>
were not a bad ideology run amok. He argues that once in power, Stalin
<br>
abandoned important parts of Marxism and adopted policies that were
<br>
carefully designed to maximise Stalin's wealth (at least the wealth
<br>
that he could control over a decade or so after gaining power; his
<br>
policies probably wouldn't have maximised the wealth he could have had
<br>
if he had remained in power for 50 years, but then he probably knew he
<br>
wouldn't be in power that long).
<br>
&nbsp;Power and Prosperity isn't as thoroughly supported by empirical research
<br>
as I would like, but it is thought-provoking.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;De Soto's book has some interesting things to say about the history of
<br>
the American west. He presents some good evidence that vigilante justice
<br>
involved as much fairness and due process as the government's justice,
<br>
and that much of the homesteading that the government takes credit for
<br>
enabling happened before the government passed homesteading legislation.
