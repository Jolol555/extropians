Author: Jacob Pandian
<br>
<p>Religion is a subcategory of supernaturalism that was formulated during the
<br>
medieval period with the spurious and dangerous quest to link supernaturalism
<br>
with scientific knowledge, and this quest has continued
<br>
<p>Recently, misleading articles have appeared in newspapers and news magazines
<br>
claiming that religion and science are cooperating to explore the nature of
<br>
reality. Gregg Easterbrook (1999) noted that &quot;Signs of renewed interest in
<br>
science and religion are numerous. The topic has recently been a top-selling
<br>
cover for both Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report. Universities such as
<br>
Princeton and Cambridge, which in the 1960s didn't even offer courses in the
<br>
relationship between science and religion, have established chairs for its
<br>
study.&quot;
<br>
<p>Easterbrook points to the central role of the John Templeton Foundation in
<br>
encouraging the cooperation between science and religion. The Foundation
<br>
publishes Progress in Theology magazine but more importantly awards millions
<br>
of dollars to people who reflect their philosophy of cooperation.
<br>
<p>The 2001 Templeton prize, $1 million, was announced March 9. It went to the
<br>
Rev. Arthur Peacocke, a British biochemist and Anglican priest who has written
<br>
widely about God and science. The Templeton Award recipient for 2000 was
<br>
Freeman J. Dyson, an emeritus professor of physics at the Institute of
<br>
Advanced Study in Princeton. As reported by Larry Stammer (2000), Dyson was
<br>
&quot;baffled&quot; at receiving the award because the Templeton prize is awarded for
<br>
&quot;Progress in Religion&quot; and not for progress in science. Dyson claimed that he
<br>
was &quot;not a theologian&quot; and &quot;not a saint.&quot; In his reflections on science and
<br>
religion, Dyson noted that &quot;The universe has a mind of its own. We know mind
<br>
plays a big role in our own lives. It's likely, in fact, that mind has a big
<br>
role in the way the whole universe functions. If you like, you call it God. It
<br>
all makes sense.&quot;
<br>
<p>Before that, $1.2 million was awarded to Ian G. Barbour, a retired professor
<br>
from Carleton College. At Carleton he was professor of physics, professor of
<br>
religion, and Bean Professor of Science, Technology and Society. His book
<br>
Religion and Science (1997) is described by its publisher (Harper San
<br>
Francisco) as &quot;a definitive contemporary discussion of the many issues
<br>
surrounding our understanding of God and religious truth and experience in our
<br>
scientific age.&quot; Earlier recipients of the Templeton Award include the
<br>
Protestant Christian evangelist Billy Graham, the Catholic Christian nun
<br>
Mother Teresa, the campus crusader William Bright, and the Russian novelist
<br>
Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Ian Barbour, according to Gregg Easterbrook, &quot;promptly
<br>
announced he would give $1 million of his award to the Berkeley, California,
<br>
Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences, an affiliate of Berkeley's
<br>
Graduate Theological Union, and an organization whose own 1981 founding and
<br>
rising importance are indicators of the science-an d-religion trend.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ralph Estling, in an essay called &quot;Templeton and AAAS&quot; in the SKEPTICAL
<br>
INQUIRER (2000), pointed out that the American Association for the Advancement
<br>
of Science has &quot;a problem&quot;: This association, which &quot;has been promoting a
<br>
study known as the 'Program of Dialogue on Science, Ethics and Religion,&quot;'
<br>
received for four years cash contributions of over one million dollars from
<br>
the Templeton Foundation. As many board members of AAAS are also associated
<br>
with the Templeton Foundation, Estling is right in raising questions about
<br>
&quot;conflict of interest,&quot; and he advises the AAAS &quot;to get the hell out from
<br>
under the John Templeton Foundation.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p><p>I suggest that the problem is a much larger one than the Templeton
<br>
Foundation's attempt to influence the scope of science through monetary awards
<br>
to scientific organizations and scientists. The more serious problem stems
<br>
from our profound misunderstanding of why and how the concept of religion was
<br>
developed by the church fathers of the early medieval period our of the
<br>
Roman/Latin concept of religio. It is this misunderstanding that opens the
<br>
door to organizations such as the Templeton Foundation, and to arguments that
<br>
science and religion should cooperate in understanding the nature of the
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>Religio, Religion, and Supernaturalism
<br>
<p>Supernaturalism (i.e., beliefs and practices associated with supernatural
<br>
beings and supernatural power) is a cultural universal. Religion, however, is
<br>
not a cultural universal; it is a subset of supernaturalism that developed
<br>
during the medieval period of the Christian tradition to represent Christian
<br>
supernaturalism as scientific truth. During this period, the Roman/Latin
<br>
concept of religio changed its meaning and significance from ritual activities
<br>
to doctrinal statements about the nature of the world and humankind.
<br>
<p>An excellent discussion of why and how the Roman/Latin concept of religio was
<br>
transformed by the church fathers into religion (attributing different
<br>
characteristics to religio) is offered in William Canrwell Smith's very
<br>
important book on the subject of religion, The Meaning and End of Religion
<br>
(1991). The concept of religion was developed in the Christian tradition to
<br>
represent Christian truths as opposed to the untruths of &quot;pagan&quot; traditions of
<br>
the Greeks and Romans and the satanic or demonic distortions that, from the
<br>
Christian theory of religion, prevailed in non-Christian traditions.
<br>
<p>The concept of religion that had become the theoretical framework for
<br>
explaining Greco-Roman and non-Western traditions as false was also opposed to
<br>
and contrasted with the supernaturalism of the non-Christians in general.
<br>
Christian supernaturalism was conceptualized within the framework of religion
<br>
as the scientific truth about the world and humankind. Christianity
<br>
established an epistemological link between science and supernaturalism by
<br>
conceptualizing religion as the framework to explain natural phenomena and to
<br>
explain the nature of the relationship between God and humankind. In such a
<br>
view, the religious framework of Christianity was aligned with scientific
<br>
naturalism, and non -Christian supernaturalism was aligned with supersition.
<br>
<p>For over fifteen hundred years we have been using the term religion without
<br>
fully realizing its origin and development. Scholars have used the term to
<br>
identify and discuss the supernaturalism of both non-Christian and Christian
<br>
traditions. But while ancient civilizations such as the Greeks, Romans,
<br>
Chinese, and Hindus had elaborate beliefs and activities that we associate
<br>
with supernaturalism, they did not have &quot;religion,&quot; i.e., a formulation that
<br>
combines scientific knowledge and supernaturalism. Thus labels such as Greek
<br>
religion, Roman religion, Chinese religion, Hindu religion, and so on are
<br>
erroneous. It would be more appropriate to discard the use of the term
<br>
religion and instead attempt to define and discuss Christian supernaturalism,
<br>
just as we describe and discuss other supernaturalisms.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Is there conflict or cooperation between supernaturalism and science? No.
<br>
Supernaturalism belongs to the pan-human myth-making activity that generates
<br>
models of personal/cultural coherence and integration through the formulations
<br>
of supernatural beings and supernatural power. Science belongs to the
<br>
pan-human analytic activity that generates accurate models to approximate,
<br>
explain, and use nature.
<br>
<p>Is there conflict or cooperation between Christian religion an science? Yes.
<br>
Some cultural traditions, including the Christian tradition, have attempted to
<br>
merge supernaturalism and science. Religion is the product of such an attempt,
<br>
and the debate on cooperation between religion and science is a renewed
<br>
attempt to subordinate science to supernaturalism. The first special issue of
<br>
the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER devoted to science and religion (Frazier 1999) failed
<br>
to note the fact that religion was a conceptual frame-work, a cultural
<br>
category, which the church fathers of the medieval period developed to link
<br>
science and supernaturalism epistemologically in order to proclaim
<br>
Christianity as the true explanation of the world and humankind.
<br>
<p>Many respected scientists appear to be unaware of this epistemological link.
<br>
Stephen Jay Gould (1999a) notes that &quot;Science and religion should be equal,
<br>
mutually respecting partners, each the master of its own domain and with each
<br>
domain vital to human life in a different way.&quot; In his book Rocks of Ages:
<br>
Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life (1999b), Gould writes: &quot;I do not
<br>
see how science and religion could be unified, or even synthesized, under any
<br>
common scheme of explanation or analysis; but I also do nor understand why the
<br>
two enterprises should experience conflict. Science tries to document the
<br>
factual character of the natural world, and to develop theories that
<br>
coordinate and explain these facts. Religion, on the other hand, operates in
<br>
the equally important, but utterly different, realm of human purposes,
<br>
meanings and values--subjects that the factual domain of science might
<br>
illuminate, but never resolve.&quot;
<br>
<p>We can agree with Gould's assessment of the relationship (or the lack of
<br>
relationship) between science and religion only if the term supernaturalism is
<br>
substituted for the term religion. I am surprised and puzzled that Gould, who
<br>
has delved into historical issues in many of his essays, failed to make note
<br>
of the reasons why and how the framework of religion developed.
<br>
<p>Arising in the Roman cultural tradition, the Latin term religio had multiple
<br>
meanings such as &quot;the acquisition and possession of supernatural power&quot; and
<br>
&quot;the performance of rituals for supernatural beings.&quot; Religio referred to
<br>
activities that dealt with supernatural powers and beings, and not with a
<br>
conceptual model of the world. Religio was nor linked or contrasted with
<br>
science in the pre-Chrisrian traditions of the West, but the medieval
<br>
Christian church fathers such as Saint Augustine used religio to signifv the
<br>
true knowledge about the nature of the world and humankind. The church, with
<br>
its hierarchical priesthood, became the custodian of this true knowledge
<br>
embodied in religion, combining supernaturalism and science.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Attempts to Integrate Religion Into Science
<br>
<p>Contemporary efforts to represent science and religion as two ways of
<br>
searching for true knowledge are essentially a continuation and revitalization
<br>
of the medieval notion of religion. We are inundated with statements such as
<br>
&quot;evolution is God's way of organizing the natural world,&quot; &quot;evolution is God's
<br>
way of creating human self-awareness,&quot; &quot;scientific discoveries reveal God's
<br>
design,&quot; and &quot;science is God's gift to humankind.&quot; There are scientists who
<br>
intentionally or unintentionally confuse the separation of supernaturalism and
<br>
science by confusing their personal supernaturalism and their objects of
<br>
inquiry and, in turn, lend scientific legitimacy to religion.
<br>
<p>The American scientist Dr. Richard Sneed, in an interview on CNN (1999),
<br>
advocated human cloning with comments such as the following: God created
<br>
humans in God's image; God would not have given the intelligence to clone
<br>
unless God wanted cloning; and cloning was a way of getting close to God.
<br>
Peter Gosselin (2000) reported that Francis Collins, who runs the Human Genome
<br>
Research Institute, is a &quot;rare combination of premier scientist and devout
<br>
Christian. [Collins] professes belief in a God that is beyond the reach of
<br>
science. He says the pursuit of the genetic code is not, as some worry, an
<br>
attempt by humans to play God, but only humans' way of admiring God's
<br>
handiwork. 'God is not threatened by all this' he said in a television
<br>
interview. 'I think God thinks it's wonderful that we puny creatures are going
<br>
about the business of trying to understand how our instruction book works,
<br>
because it's a very elegant instruction book indeed.'&quot;
<br>
<p>God can be and is used to justify and legitimize any custom or activity,
<br>
including science. God can also serve as a vehicle to prevent free inquiry and
<br>
critical thinking in areas that are prohibited in the name of God, whose
<br>
prohibition is verified only by the custodians of God and those who accept the
<br>
custodial claims made in the name of God. Over a hundred years ago, the
<br>
theologian/biblical scholar/anthropologist William Robertson Smith
<br>
unsuccessfully defended himself as a scientist who had the moral duty to
<br>
explore the cultural foundations of Christianity. He was tried for heresy by
<br>
the Free Church of Scotland and defrocked. His defense was that if God did not
<br>
want scientific research on discovering the origins of customs, God would not
<br>
have endowed humans with rationality; he argued that thc non-use of
<br>
rationality in the furtherance of science was fundamentally a non-Christian
<br>
attitude. Smith's inquisitors did not accept his defense because in their view
<br>
the Bible was the revealed truth about the nature of the world and humans, and
<br>
humans could not fathom the mind of God.
<br>
<p>The intellectual history of the past five hundred years has been one of
<br>
religion attempting to preempt and/or incorporate scientific discoveries as
<br>
religious truths. Church-affiliated or sectarian universities were built to
<br>
produce and disseminate religious truths as they were supported by science. If
<br>
and when scientific discoveries could not be formulated and presented as
<br>
religious truths, there were inquisitorial persecutions of scientists who were
<br>
identified as heretics or as atheists. The teaching of &quot;natural theology&quot; and
<br>
its opposition to the Darwinian model of life forms prevailed for a long time
<br>
in academia. We now have departments of religion or religious studies in
<br>
academia that continue the same intellectual tradition. What occurs today is a
<br>
much more sophisticated and nuanced attempt to discredit the foundations of
<br>
science through spurious platitudes such as &quot;religion and science must respect
<br>
each other,&quot; &quot;religion and science must cooperate to seek the basis of
<br>
reality,&quot; &quot;religion and science ha ve a common ground,&quot; and &quot;religion and
<br>
science must seek together to better the conditions of human life.&quot; These
<br>
statements contain expressions that have universal appeal: &quot;respect for each
<br>
other,&quot; &quot;cooperation,&quot; and &quot;looking for a common ground for discourse and the
<br>
search for the betterment of human conditions&quot; are laudable goals of all human
<br>
beings. But by linking supernaturalism and science epistemologically, a
<br>
distorted view of science is created, which could lead to the rejection of the
<br>
scientific method because it discredits God's design or plan.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>The scholars of the Enlightenment who did so much to affirm the scientific
<br>
method and liberate scientific research from supernaturalism failed to
<br>
recognize that religion was a medieval Christian invention that was developed
<br>
to oppose what the Church claimed to be pagan, magical, and demonic
<br>
supernaturalism. Many scholastic treatises on God and the world were viewed by
<br>
Enlightenment thinkers as facilitating the scientific understanding of the
<br>
world--for example, formulations concerning a rational God and the rationality
<br>
of the world, with humans endowed with reason to discover the rationality of
<br>
the world. Enlightenment thinkers for the most part supported the ethnocentric
<br>
assumption that religion was superior and more advanced than primitive
<br>
supernaturalism and that the West had progressed and advanced along the
<br>
evolutionary ladder because of the applications of rationality to discover the
<br>
laws of nature and create rational institutions. The Enlightenment, which did
<br>
so much to revive the Greek ideals of scie nce, was caught in the Christian
<br>
theological assertions about the nature of religion and supernaturalism. When
<br>
the exponents of the Enlightenment attacked primitive irrationality as
<br>
standing in the way of progress, the focus was on non-Western peoples and
<br>
cultures who, in the view of these scholars, embodied supernaturalism.
<br>
<p>The anthropological discourse on humankind was (and is) equally caught in the
<br>
Christian theological assertions about the nature of religion and
<br>
supernaturalism. Nineteenth-century sociologists and anthropologists
<br>
postulated that magic, witchcraft, and divination constituted beliefs and
<br>
practices that preceded religion and monotheism, and that monotheism and
<br>
religion manifested themselves only in the higher stages of human mental
<br>
development. There was also hope that religion would be replaced by science as
<br>
(and when) the human mind progressed to attain positivistic understanding of
<br>
natural phenomena. Twentieth-century anthropologists and sociologists devoted
<br>
considerable rime to defining religion, with definitions ranging from religion
<br>
as supernaturalism to religion as sacred or sanctified values of society, and
<br>
as the quest for ultimate meaning and reality. Postmodernists have reflected
<br>
upon whether the definition of religion as supernaturalism is an ethnocentric
<br>
Western assumption, suggesting that religion should be understood as a system
<br>
of ordering the world and human life.
<br>
<p>Defining Terms and Clarifying Arguments
<br>
<p>Perhaps it would clarify discussion if we discarded the use of the term
<br>
religion and substituted the term supernaturalism. As I noted earlier,
<br>
supernaturalism is a cultural universal. Historically humans have created
<br>
beliefs and practices associated with supernatural beings and supernatural
<br>
powers, and these beliefs and practices have been used to construct sacred
<br>
self and group identities and to formulate models or narratives of coherence
<br>
and meaning to cope with feelings of helplessness, encounters with suffering
<br>
and injustice, realities of uncertainty, and fear and anxiety associated with
<br>
sickness and death. Humans have created innumerable forms of the supernatural
<br>
world with an infinite range of attributes, and this process of creating and
<br>
maintaining the supernatural world will continue. Science does not attempt to
<br>
replace or duplicate this creative process, but it attempts to study the
<br>
relevance and significance of this process in human life.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>It is necessary to understand that the concept of religion that developed in
<br>
the medieval period combines supernaturalism and science to formulate
<br>
statements about the world and humankind. In this sense, religion does nor
<br>
complement science but pre-empts and co-opts scientific discourse in support
<br>
of supernaturalism. The most overt expression of how religion uses science in
<br>
affirming supernaturalism is found in the evangelical or fundamental Christian
<br>
perspective known as scientific creationism&quot; or &quot;creationist science.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Creation scientists&quot; do not see the combination of creation myths and science
<br>
as an oxymoron but as a way of using the vocabulary of science to foster
<br>
biblical discourse as scientific.
<br>
<p>A recent example of how supernaturalism and science are combined is found in a
<br>
lawsuit filed in the Minnesota Court of Appeals by a fundamentalist Christian
<br>
teacher, Lod LaVake. As reported by Joseph Tyrangiel (2000), LaVake's attorney
<br>
has claimed that &quot;For the first time, we have a teacher who is nor asking to
<br>
teach creationism. He simply wants to reach science the way he thinks--and the
<br>
way a lot of people think--it should be taught, in a more balanced way.&quot; The
<br>
implication is that Mr. LaVake should be permitted to reach science the way it
<br>
supports his belief and the belief of many other fundamentalist Christians.
<br>
<p>Tyrangiel correctly notes, &quot;Indeed, creationists have become a lot more
<br>
shrewd. For years they'd propose antievolution laws and lesson plans brimming
<br>
with religious language, and for years their cases were struck down on
<br>
constitutional grounds. Like LaVake, they began co-opting the logic of
<br>
Darwinists and speaking in a softer voice.&quot;
<br>
<p>Religion does not complement science but pre-empts and co-opts scientific
<br>
discourse in support of supernaturalism. We must recognize the importance of
<br>
supernaturalism in human life and foster its study in terms of why and how
<br>
humans create and maintain it. The use of the term religion to discuss the
<br>
role of supernaturalism confuses and distorts our understanding of the latter.
<br>
To the public, the use of religion would be more palatable and respectable
<br>
than the use of the term supernaturalism because supernaturalism conjures up
<br>
images of irrational practices such as witchcraft and magic as opposed to
<br>
religion, which is viewed as a rational, scientific understanding of the
<br>
world. When scientific research discredits the assumptions of religion, there
<br>
is conflict between science and religion unless the scientific discoveries are
<br>
incorporated into the religious framework.
<br>
<p>As a first step toward resolving the &quot;science and religion&quot; controversy, and
<br>
focusing on the real issues that reveal the nature of science and
<br>
supernaturalism, I suggest that we rename the &quot;departments of religion&quot; in
<br>
academia and call them &quot;departments of supernaturalism.&quot; It is more
<br>
appropriate to have a discourse on &quot;comparative supernaturalism&quot; than on
<br>
&quot;comparative religion&quot; because religion, as I noted earlier, is an emic,
<br>
indigenous category that acquired significance in the medieval period of the
<br>
Western tradition in an attempt to combine supernaturalism and science within
<br>
the framework of religion.
