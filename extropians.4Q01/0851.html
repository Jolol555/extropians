<p>
At various points I've read suggestions on this list that to distribute free 
<br>
or low-cost eBooks, rich with mind-expanding educational material, would do 
<br>
much to counter the sort of worldview responsible for violent Muslim 
<br>
fundamentalism.  See, eg, the sort of reader described in The Diamond Age.  
<br>
But, alas, technology has yet to deliver the requisite goods.  Hence the 
<br>
present low tech suggestion: Educate via comics.
<br>
<p>I do not jest.  The U.S. has been trying to educate/propagandize the Afgan 
<br>
people via airdrops of transistor radios and rather ineffective (because 
<br>
delivered via airplanes) broadcasts.  Paper materials would work much more 
<br>
effectively, since they are more permanent and cheap to distribute.  But text 
<br>
won't suffice, given the wide range of dialects and horrible levels of 
<br>
illiteracy among those subject to Taliban tyranny.  Comics thus offer a nice, 
<br>
and perhaps the only viable, alternative.
<br>
<p>A good illustrator can convey fairly complex ideas (such as the earnest good 
<br>
wishes of those launching cruise missles at Afgan territory and questionable 
<br>
nature of the theology behind the attacks of 9/11) and give them satisfying 
<br>
emotional punch.  The delivery channel is relatively cheap and data 
<br>
rich--colored ink on paper--and will be consumed and passed around if only 
<br>
because it offers, in this case, a pleasantly novel alternative to staring at 
<br>
the dirt.  Distributing comics offers a complication in that the Taliban 
<br>
forbids images of humans, but I daresay that might work in favor of the 
<br>
edugandists.  Certainly, at any rate, the Taliban cannot hope to marshall as 
<br>
good or as many artists on their side.
<br>
<p>There are plenty of illustrators who are or should be appalled at the 
<br>
anti-culture stance of the Taliban, not to mention its other grevious crimes 
<br>
against humanity (especially the female half of it).  It remains only to 
<br>
marshall that artistic sentiment and convince those doing airdrops to add 
<br>
comics to the bombs and food already raining down on Afgan soil.
