</em><br>
<p>This is true, but it doesn't necessarily mean that everyone wins in
<br>
this situation.  Even with reproduction costs of zero, it may not
<br>
be to the artist's advantage to sell their works infinitely cheaply.
<br>
There will be diminishing returns as they lower their costs.  The point
<br>
that maximizes profits will not necessarily be a cheap sales price.
<br>
<p>For example, the Dixie Chicks sold 9 million copies of their Fly album in
<br>
the two years after it was released [1].  It probably sold for about $15.
<br>
If they had reduced the cost to 1/10 as much or $1.50, would they have
<br>
sold 10 times as many copies?  90 million copies?  That's almost as many
<br>
as there are households in America (116 million [2]).
<br>
<p>I don't think the market is that big for the Dixie Chicks' music.
<br>
Even at $1.50 a copy, they would not sell an album to every household
<br>
in the country.  They would make less money at 1/10 the price per unit.
<br>
<p>The Dixie Chicks do better to sell their album for a larger amount and
<br>
sell to fewer people.  The exact point of optimality will depend on how
<br>
quickly the market falls off as the price rises.
