<p>
This is pretty much offtopic, although sf is of general salience to
<br>
futuristic thinking.
<br>
<p>I'm wonder how many of the younger extropes (under 30, say, but don't feel
<br>
squeezed out) have read a fair percentage of the novels, and maybe shorter
<br>
fiction, in the following ballots from the '60s. (I'm preparing an essay
<br>
for a potentially important book on sf, so I'd like to get a sense of the
<br>
room, ya dig?) 
<br>
<p>One or two of the novels from each year? Nearly all from all years? A
<br>
couple from the whole bag?
<br>
<p>Don't send comments to the list unless this seems generally interesting;
<br>
I'd welcome brief comments to my @.
