<p><p>I don't know the particular dance you're referring to, but in other
<br>
instances I know, I think that you &quot;sublimate&quot; the suffering by
<br>
evoking/dancing (the reality causing) the suffering IN A PARTICULAR
<br>
WAY. This &quot;way&quot;, it is the dancing itself, it is that which is not the
<br>
suffering itself.
<br>
<p>In SOME instances, this translates, as you suggest, in evoking
<br>
something ELSE than (the reality causing) the suffering. But it
<br>
doesn't need to be that way, and isn't all the time.
<br>
<p>It's enough to invent a particular way to dance your suffering (see in
<br>
fact the suffering as the background music), that allows you to make
<br>
something out of it, and possibly to turn your experience into
<br>
something positive. Instead of being squashed by it, you regain
<br>
control and live it in a positive way.
<br>
<p>In still other terms, you have a choice, when you operate the
<br>
&quot;artistic transmutation of suffering&quot; :-), between overtly keeping the
<br>
suffering on the forestage, or not. It's just a question of
<br>
organisation. You can create by tranposing and substituting something
<br>
else ; or you can create by inventing a way to dance the given
<br>
experience.
