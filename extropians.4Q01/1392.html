Commenting on the Lionel Tiger article, Samantha wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is rather biased and I believe, quite inaccurate. The real

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did not notice nor hear of young men being unable to find wives.
</em><br>
<p>We should be specific here to avoid generalizations.  Precisely
<br>
where was &quot;the area&quot; you were in?  My read of the article seems
<br>
to suggest that in some Arabian countries the men has started to
<br>
resort to &quot;importing&quot; foreign brides and the government takes
<br>
steps to discourage this.  When a government acts on something
<br>
it has usually risen to the level of being something they view
<br>
as a problem.  Similarly the Saudis are in the middle of returning
<br>
all immigrant workers to their original countries to provide
<br>
job opportunities for their younger generation.  According to
<br>
the NY Times article I read, this will probably not solve
<br>
the problem.  I don't think young women are going to marry
<br>
young men who are unable to provide for the family.
<br>
<p>Samantha -- if you go back through my posts you will find I am
<br>
*no* fan of the U.S. covert actions overseas.  You are correct
<br>
that we created bin Laden and have significantly contributed
<br>
to the situations in Afganistan, the Mid East and Africa to
<br>
name a few places.  The question is how to best extricate
<br>
ourselves given things we have done that in the past we thought
<br>
were the correct thing to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The article is useless as purported explanation.
</em><br>
<p>I don't find that to be the case.  I find the combination of
<br>
a the fine points of a religion allowing the &quot;wealthy&quot; to
<br>
create an artificial shortage of potential mates combined
<br>
with the unemployment of the poor quite suggestive that
<br>
the problem is not going to go away anytime soon (no matter
<br>
*what* we do in Afghanistan).
<br>
<p>Commenting on the Zuckerman article:
<br>
<em>&gt; It is also important to point out that the adaptation of means is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly not over and that we are vulnerable and cannot remove all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the means we are without destroying much that we value highly. 
</em><br>
<p>I would tend to agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Reducing dependence on nuclear energy makes no sense at all. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without it we will not replace dependence on mid east oil. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear plants are much more centralized and easier to defend. 
</em><br>
<p>I would not want to see us looking at nuclear as a sole solution.
<br>
We *can* totally replace mid east oil with solar (I've done
<br>
the numbers on this).  We have to be concerned about all of the
<br>
unprotected power line towers.  That suggests an adaptation
<br>
that would make our power system more reliant on smaller
<br>
distributed power sources is a good idea.
<br>
<p>Regarding your explanation of a &quot;fatwa&quot;, then we may be dealing
<br>
with a problem of education.  You may be correct in the real
<br>
meaning of the term.  The question is -- do the less well educated
<br>
(or indoctrinated) male population of countries like Egypt,
<br>
Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan or Pakistan understand that a &quot;fatwa&quot;
<br>
is not a justification for becoming a terrorist?  If they don't
<br>
then our debating the fine points of what can and cannot be
<br>
used to justify an action in their minds isn't going to make
<br>
much of a difference.
