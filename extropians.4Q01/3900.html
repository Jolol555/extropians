<em>&gt; If it lives up to the description in the Time magazine article, I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Segway has got a lot of potential.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A couple of points buried in the article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - It doesn't go fast enough for people to hurt themselves if they crash,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it does go faster than walking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - It uses very little power, extremely little; its range should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent.
</em><br>
<p>It's range is 17 miles, at a speed of 8 mph. That is twice the speed of
<br>
a fast walk, and not very useful as a commuter vehicle: the average
<br>
commute today is over 25 miles and rising. Are you willing to spend a
<br>
couple hours every morning and evening standing up on this thing,
<br>
exposed to the elements?
<br>
<p>I admit that it will likely be useful in a 'park and ride' environment,
<br>
as well as in the 'urban village' environment. The only concern I have
<br>
is that you can already go that fast on some rollerblades in the same
<br>
environments, and get some exercise as well (and blades don't cost $3k).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  - It's not supposed to compete with cars, it's supposed to compete with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feet. More correctly, it's supposed to fill a niche that isn't currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; covered, and support cities that are basically giant pedestrian malls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrounded by car parks. Reading between the lines, I think you are supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to bring the Segway to the edge of town in your car (or on the train or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bus), then zoom around the car-free zone.
</em><br>
<p>Outside of roller blades, there are already a number of electric
<br>
scooters and bikes on the market, which are all far cheaper than IT, and
<br>
have greater range and maximum speeds. The only real market hook is the
<br>
gyrostabilization for the tandem wheels, and that adds nothing to the
<br>
actual performance of the vehicle, it sucks power. It's a gimmick, an
<br>
overpriced toy.
<br>
<p>The whole point of his year-long &quot;this is not a PR campaign, it's a
<br>
secret&quot; PR campaign is to generate a 'vaporware' lock on the market,
<br>
damaging the sales of other electric scooters and bikes, and generating
<br>
the hype to seize market share despite the obvious price and performance
<br>
problems of the product compared with the competition.
