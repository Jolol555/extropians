In v6#361 Brian wrote: &quot;It's time the U.S. started paying more attention to
<br>
it's national interests.
<br>
<p>As a U.S. taxpayer I would object to my funds being given to a foreign
<br>
company for this purpose, local workers exempted. If companies in other
<br>
countries want the business/charity work, let them convince their
<br>
governments to shell out the Bucks/Marks. Peso's whatever.
<br>
<p>Part of the U.S.'s problem in the world is simple PR. During the holidays I
<br>
was watching TV as a man in Afghanistan was criticizing the U.S. with a bag
<br>
of wheat clearly labelled &quot;USA&quot; slung over his shoulder. Had I been standing
<br>
there I would have &quot;pulled a Giuliani&quot;, dragged it away from him with an
<br>
explanation as to why,
<br>
and told him to try eating dirt.
<br>
<p>In marketspeak the US needs to push it's brand, and quit catering to the
<br>
prejudices of the rest of the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>Brian - to be frank your comments disturb me in their arrogance. The USA is
<br>
dropping bombs on these people for god's sake! The USA is at least partly
<br>
responsible for the rise of the Taliban to power. The USA helped create,
<br>
train &amp; directly funded, elements in Afghanistan that are at least partly
<br>
responsible for the terrible years of war &amp; bloodshed that the country has
<br>
endured. How many Afghanis have died as a direct result of American
<br>
policies? Should the people of Afghanistan say &quot;Well the US fucked us over
<br>
for the last twenty years, they helped psychotic religious nuts become our
<br>
government by giving them guns &amp; missiles, they've bombed the crap out of us
<br>
day &amp; night for the last few months, they killed twenty people in my village
<br>
by mistake last week, but now they just gave me a bag of wheat so now USA is
<br>
A-OK&quot;. Do you really expect twenty odd years of utter bastardry to be just
<br>
forgotten, just because NOW you've decided to act with SOME decency? 
<br>
<p>There are people in this world who hate America &amp; America has given them
<br>
plenty of good reasons to have that hate. If you truly want the US to be
<br>
safe then the US must act responsibly. It must stop its political &amp; military
<br>
support of terrorists (sorry, they're &quot;freedom fighters&quot; - at least they are
<br>
until they start bombing YOU) against legitimate elected governments. It
<br>
must stop its support of governments &amp; dictators that torture &amp; kill &amp; rob
<br>
their own citizens. It must stop putting the well-being of its business &amp;
<br>
military interests above the basic human rights of other people, regardless
<br>
of their citizenship. 
<br>
<p>It will not be more security that will prevent more terrorist attacks. It
<br>
will not be the death of every Al Quada member that prevents more terrorist
<br>
attacks. It will not be facial recognition software &amp; the automatic
<br>
detention of every Muslim that will prevent more terrorist attacks. It will
<br>
not be American military might that will prevent more terrorist attacks. 
<br>
<p>America must become responsible &amp; decent. The empty rhetoric of &quot;liberty &amp;
<br>
justice for all&quot;, the lie of &quot;the protector of freedom&quot; &amp; the &quot;champion of
<br>
justice&quot; must become true. America could become what the dream of America
<br>
has always been, America can lead the world, and not just militarily or
<br>
commercially but ethically as well, if only the government &amp; the people of
<br>
America have the strength and courage. 
<br>
<p>There can be no justification for the events of 9/11 just as there can be no
<br>
justification for the many atrocities &amp; crimes of convenience that have been
<br>
committed in America's name. The cycle of hatred has to stop somewhere or we
<br>
will see the events of 9/11 happening again. And again. And again. 
<br>
<p>America can be more than just America the great, it could truly become
<br>
America the good, America the just, America the free, if only the nation &amp;
<br>
it's people have the courage &amp; the humility to change for the better, to
<br>
give as well as receive, to heal instead of harm, to become a true leader of
<br>
humanity. 
<br>
<p>The rebuilding of Afghanistan is only the first challenge, but it is an
<br>
important one. It is a chance for the US to show that there is more to it's
<br>
motives than simple revenge. It is a chance for the US to show that it can
<br>
rise up against anger &amp; grief &amp; hatred. There was no shortage of bravery
<br>
among the fire-fighters &amp; police who risked all on 9/11 - can America the
<br>
same selfless courage as a nation?
<br>
