Here's an interesting article with some concrete proposals. Does anyone on
<br>
this list know how far the author is right about the relative cost of energy
<br>
alternatives given mass production ?
<br>
<p><p><p>THURSDAY OCTOBER 18 2001
<br>
<p>The West must break its addiction to oil
<br>
<p>ANATOLE KALETSKY
<br>
<p>If there is one thing demonstrated by yesterday's assassination of an
<br>
Israeli minister it is that the Middle East is a madhouse. When lunatics
<br>
take over the asylum - whether they are religious fundamentalists, as in
<br>
Afghanistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia, or secular megalomaniacs, as in Iraq -
<br>
there are two sensible ways for the rest of the world to respond.
<br>
The first is to restore some semblance of order and the rule of law, if not
<br>
of reason. That is what America and its allies are now doing in Afghanistan,
<br>
with every prospect of success in the short term. The second response is to
<br>
try to protect the rest of the world from the consequences of future
<br>
outbreaks of Middle East madness.
<br>
<p>Much has been said about the military and diplomatic components of this
<br>
&quot;second phase&quot; of the war against terror. But if the long-term objective is
<br>
to offer permanent security for the people of America, Europe and Asia from
<br>
the consequences of sharing a world with the Middle Eastern madhouse, then
<br>
the most important element of the war against terror has not even been
<br>
discussed. That element is a coherent, patient and relentless strategy to
<br>
free the world from its addiction to Middle Eastern oil.
<br>
<p>There are several clear links between terrorism and Middle Eastern oil. One
<br>
such link is noted on this page by Gary Hart: American foreign policy has
<br>
become a &quot;hostage&quot; to oil dependence. Energy dependence has tied the West's
<br>
hands in pursuing long-term diplomatic interests.
<br>
<p>An even more direct link runs from oil money to terror. Oil money is the
<br>
main source of financing for terrorism and religious fanaticism throughout
<br>
the Islamic world.
<br>
<p>Another link with terror runs through the debilitating economic effect of
<br>
oil wealth on the producing countries themselves. Economically, oil has been
<br>
more of a curse than a blessing for the Middle East. While it has produced
<br>
fabulous riches for ruling families and their cronies, oil wealth has
<br>
devalued education, protected medieval social structures and discouraged
<br>
genuine wealth creation. The creativity and entrepreneurial drive that were
<br>
once synonymous with Arab culture have been diverted into a corrupt,
<br>
zero-sum game of squabbling over inert mineral wealth.
<br>
<p>It has long been a maxim of development economics that &quot;the lucky countries
<br>
are the ones with no resources&quot;. The economies that have developed fastest -
<br>
and have done best for their common people - have been countries such as
<br>
Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and China, which have been forced to rely on
<br>
education, technology and commerce, rather than living off natural resources
<br>
in the style of such &quot;richer&quot; countries as Russia or Nigeria. Even in the
<br>
Middle East, some of the most prosperous and stable countries, for example
<br>
Jordan, Morocco and Bahrain, have been the ones with little or no oil.
<br>
<p>But isn't reducing our dependence on Middle Eastern oil just a pipe-dream?
<br>
After all, energy use will inevitably keep expanding as living standards
<br>
grow around the world. And crude oil currently accounts for 49 per cent of
<br>
global energy consumption. To make matters worse, the Middle Eastern members
<br>
of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) are sitting on
<br>
53 per cent of the world's proven oil reserves, and Saudi Arabia alone
<br>
controls almost half this sea of oil.
<br>
<p>All this is true, yet the quest for energy independence may not be as
<br>
quixotic as suggested by many energy experts, who tend to have an interest
<br>
in preserving the status quo. For a start, the figures on current oil
<br>
production - as opposed to the reserves which may or may not be pumped from
<br>
the ground in future decades - make the problem look rather less daunting.
<br>
At present, Middle Eastern Opec members produce 26 per cent of the global
<br>
supply of crude oil, equivalent to just under 13 per cent of the world's
<br>
total energy consumption. Saudi Arabia alone provides just 5 per cent of
<br>
global energy supply. Iraq and Iran each account for around 1 per cent.
<br>
<p>In any other business, the idea that the world could be held to ransom by a
<br>
producer controlling just a few per cent of global output would be dismissed
<br>
as absurd. What, then, is so different about oil? The answer consists of
<br>
three parts, each of which relates to a different component of the strategy
<br>
for energy independence that is urgently needed after the terrorist attacks.
<br>
<p>First, it is widely assumed that nothing can be done to reduce energy
<br>
consumption without hitting living standards and economic growth. This is
<br>
utter nonsense. A simple shift in tax structures - sharply increasing energy
<br>
taxes and recycling the money back to consumers through other tax cuts -
<br>
could have a dramatic effect on energy demand.
<br>
<p>Of course, President Bush has rejected any such policy, in part because he
<br>
represented an oil state. And the British Government last year moved in the
<br>
opposite direction - Gordon Brown unforgivably cut petrol duties and eased
<br>
industrial energy taxes in his capitulation to the fuel protesters. But if
<br>
either the US or British Government are serious about their war against
<br>
terrorism, these egregious policy errors can surely be reversed.
<br>
<p>Secondly, the Opec cartel has amplified the power of individual Middle
<br>
Eastern countries. Opec countries account for 40 per cent of world oil
<br>
production and 19 per cent of total energy demand. The second step in
<br>
disarming the oil weapon is therefore to try to break the cohesion of Opec
<br>
and, above all, to accelerate the development of non-Opec oil sources. The
<br>
most promising region for increasing non-Opec production is the former
<br>
Soviet Union. If the West was willing to put extra investment into that
<br>
region, new oil equivalent to half Saudi Arabia's current production could
<br>
be pumped within a few years.
<br>
<p>The West could also work much more effectively to neutralise Opec's power by
<br>
using strategic reserves owned by the US, European and Japanese Governments.
<br>
These reserves should be built up to much larger volumes during periods of
<br>
low demand (such as now) and then dumped on to the markets whenever Opec
<br>
tries to squeeze supply.
<br>
<p>The third reason for the Middle East's excessive economic power is the
<br>
assumption that oil must remain the world's dominant energy source for at
<br>
least the next 20 or 30 years. But there is nothing inevitable about the
<br>
dominance of oil. Car engines that can run on liquified natural gas and fuel
<br>
cells have already been developed by several motor manufacturers. Vast
<br>
amounts of electricity can be generated from wind, nuclear, solar, biomass
<br>
and other non-oil sources, all of which have the additional advantage of
<br>
eliminating carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect.
<br>
<p>Why are these new technologies not already in use, or at least built into
<br>
long-term energy planning, which still rests overwhelmingly on oil? The
<br>
global energy and motor industries believe it is in their interests to delay
<br>
for as long as possible the transition from oil. Oil companies and car
<br>
makers know that alternative technologies, ranging from car fuel-cells for
<br>
cars to wind turbines for electricity generation, will never become economic
<br>
until they benefit from the rapid cost reductions that come from mass
<br>
production. As long as these technologies are relegated to experimental and
<br>
pilot programmes, they will always appear prohibitively expensive and
<br>
premature. But mass production will remain impossible until there is mass
<br>
demand - and mass demand is out of the question until energy companies
<br>
convert their distribution networks to offer alternative energy supplies.
<br>
<p>This is a clear case for government intervention, through the tax system,
<br>
through subsidies and through direct regulation - for example, by requiring
<br>
drastically lower fuel economy standards and instructing oil companies to
<br>
make alternative fuels available at their filling stations during the next
<br>
five years.
<br>
<p>Sheikh Yamani, the former Saudi oil minister, once warned his countrymen
<br>
against being too provocative in exploiting their market power during the
<br>
golden age of oil. He noted that &quot;the Stone Age did not end because the
<br>
cavemen ran out of stone&quot;. It is now time for the Western world to prove
<br>
Sheikh Yamani right. For the oil age, September 11 must mark the beginning
<br>
of the end.
