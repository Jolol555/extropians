Yeah, this is a pretty good joke.  Actually I think it is a Pepsi can,
<br>
the logo has a circle bisected by a variable-width white ribbon.
<br>
<p>The giveaway for me was the reference to phosphoric acid.  I don't drink
<br>
soda so I didn't recognize it, I thought it was something biological,
<br>
some variant on nucleic acid or something.  But I googled it and found
<br>
that it is an ingredient in cola drinks.
<br>
<p>Actually the reaction of the robots to the can is not completely
<br>
illogical.  Obviously an empty can of Pepsi is no threat to their
<br>
civilization.  But from their perspective, soda cans were replicators
<br>
which parasitized our society.  As Inoshiro says, they hooked into
<br>
sexuality, tribalism, art forms, subcultures, anything they could to
<br>
reproduce better.  The meme package was virulent and spread all over
<br>
the world.  Different kinds of soda competed to see whose memes could
<br>
spread best.  In a way, our whole world has been turned into a means by
<br>
which Pepsi cans can reproduce.
<br>
<p>That is what horrified the robots, the thought that their world could once
<br>
again become a slave to a replicator like soft drink cans.  The problem
<br>
with this is that it is absurd to suppose that any human society can avoid
<br>
memetic parasitization.  By the nature of human communication, memes exist
<br>
and spread.  Yatima and Inoshiro are just as much slaves to their own
<br>
replicative memes as we are to our soda cans and other consumer products.
<br>
<p>Hal
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;    Yatima heard something skid across the ground in front of ver; ve'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    inadvertantly kicked a small pipece of corroded metal out from under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a shrub.  Ve kept walking, but Inoshiro paused to examine it, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    cried out in alarm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;Replicator!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Yatima turned baqck and angled for a better view; the interface made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    vis body crouch.  &quot;It's just an empty canister.&quot;  It was almost crushed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    flat, but there was still paint clinging to the metal in places,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the colors faded to barely distinguishable grays.  Yatima could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    make out a portion of a narrow, roughly longitudinal band of varying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    width, slightly paler than its background; it looked to ver like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    two-dimensional representation of a twisted ribbon.  There was also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    part of a circle - though if it was a biohazard warning, it didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    look much like the ones ve recalled from vis limited browsing on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the subject.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Inoshiro spoke in a hushed, sickened voice.  &quot;Pre-Introdus, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    was pandemic.  Distorted whole nations' economies.  It had hooks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    into everything: sexuality, tribalism, half a dozen artforms and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    subcultures...  it parasitized the fleshers so thoroughly you had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    be some kind of desert monk to escape it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Yatima regarded the pathetic object dubiously, but they had no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    access to the library now, and vis knowledge of the era was patchy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;Even if there are traces left inside, I'm sure they're all immune
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    to it by now.  And it could hardly infect us -&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Inoshiro cut ver off impatiently.  &quot;We're not talking nucleotide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    viruses, here.  The molecules themselves were just a random assortment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of junk - mostly phosphoric acid; it was the memes they came wrapped
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    in that made them virulent.&quot;  Ve bent down lower, and cupped vis hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    over the battered container.  &quot;And who knows how small a fragment it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    can bootstrap from?  I'm not taking any chances.&quot;
