<p>
Granted that my experience does not appear to jibe with that of your other 
<br>
correspondents, I will nonetheless aver that I do not find mysteries like 
<br>
&quot;the Force&quot; aesthetically pleasing.  To the contrary, implausible phenomena 
<br>
detract from my enjoyment of fiction.  I thus found the latter-day 
<br>
&quot;explanation&quot; of the Force annoying only for its utter failure to convince; a 
<br>
better explanation would have delighted me, as it would have made the stories 
<br>
I enjoyed as a youth all the more real to me as an adult.  By the same token, 
<br>
the swords-and-sorcery stuff that I inhaled as youth bores me now.
<br>
<p>I trust, Damien, that you will not chalk this up as one of the &quot;dozen rants&quot; 
<br>
you expect about why &quot;why *knowing* is better than *nescience*.&quot;  By the same 
<br>
token, I trust that no one will trot out the claim that I've become a 
<br>
hard-assed, unimaginative fogy incapable of wonder.  I'm capable of wonder.  
<br>
Rather than passively &quot;ooohing&quot; and &quot;ahhing,&quot; however, wonder makes me want 
<br>
to find an explanation.
<br>
<p>Why, then, do other (typically more youthful but always, I think, more 
<br>
credulous) people dislike explanations?  I think they do so because they hope 
<br>
that unexplainable phenomena point to an easy out from the hard job of 
<br>
living.  As a kid, I got a thrill out of the Force because I thought that I, 
<br>
like Luke, might come to enjoy incredible new powers by way of mere belief.  
<br>
Like most kids, I had a lot to learn about the realm of plausibility.
<br>
<p>Wonder still excites me, but it does so because it offers the chance to 
<br>
figure something out and, in the process, perhaps to find some new and better 
<br>
way of thriving.  I suppose that on that count some explanations could 
<br>
disappoint even me--but only if I first had a pretty unrealistic expectation 
<br>
that a mysterious phenomena revealed the possibility of a new good and 
<br>
thereafter only if I found the actual explanation revealed nothing new at 
<br>
all.  As few explanations have that effect on me, however, I regard most of 
<br>
them as better than nothing.  And since mere potentials offer no gain, I 
<br>
regard all good explanations as better than ignorance.
