<em>&gt;This seems like an odd way to view things.  If you get twice as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Australian dollars, but the Australian dollars are only worth half as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much as US Dollars (which must mean that you can only buy half
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as much with an Australian dollar as with a US Dollar, all else being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equal), then you're making the same as you would in the US, right?
</em><br>
<p>I agree it doesn't seem to make much sense, but the equivalent 
<br>
non-imported are in general cheaper in Australia. An espresso in 
<br>
Australia and the US costs about the same number of dollars 
<br>
(approximately $A2 in Melbourne, approximately $US2 in Starbucks here 
<br>
in Pasadena). Imported cars, televisions, books etc reflect the 
<br>
prices of their country of origin. Non-imported goods don't seem to: 
<br>
so I used to pay $A40 for a haircut in Melbourne, now pay $US35, 
<br>
likewise food and locally made clothes are equivalent; my earlier 
<br>
rent in Australia for a one-bedroom place was about $A800, I am now 
<br>
paying $825 for an approximately equivalent place. Even a bottle of 
<br>
beer at a bar is about $A3 or $US3.
<br>
<p>The great flexibility in the Australian dollar has been major factor 
<br>
in our being able to weather the economic meltdown in Asia, and more 
<br>
lately the general global economic downturn.
<br>
<p>I am not an economist. I would be most interested in hearing a more 
<br>
detailed explanation of this. I would have thought that if our dollar 
<br>
was worth half as much we should live twice as poor, but this 
<br>
certainly is not the case.
<br>
<p>best, patrick
