<em>&gt; A reasonably strong positive association between homicide rates and the

</em><br>
<p>The above data is quite wrong. Switzerland has a 100% household gun
<br>
ownership rate for all citizen households. It's the law, as a matter of
<br>
fact, and large percent of those guns are machine guns. I believe the
<br>
27% rate reflects the rate of *handgun* ownership.
<br>
<p>Finland, similarly, according to the UN, has a 50% firearms ownership
<br>
rate.
<br>
<p>The US crime rates include areas of the country where gun ownership
<br>
and/or concealed carry is banned if not restricted to a small
<br>
eco-politically connected clique. Separating the US into two polities of
<br>
pro and anti gun jursidictions results in the pro-gun jurisdictions
<br>
having a crime rate consistent with that of Switzerland.
<br>
<p>The reason why this is necessary is that the US is the only country that
<br>
does not have all gun laws imposed at the national level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's worth taking a look at figures 1-3 of the URL if you're interested. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; document cited here is part of a UK Home Office submission to the Cullen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inquiry about the Dunblane massacre (the 1996 killing of 15 primary school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children and their teacher by Thomas Hamilton). If you need/want to look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the full judicial inquiry findings, they are at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/scottish/dunblane/dunbl">http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/scottish/dunblane/dunbl</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ane.htm
</em><br>
<p>Dunblane was over 5 years ago. Since then, US violent crime rates have
<br>
fallen by half, (while gun ownership has risen by almost 40%), and
<br>
violent crime rates in the UK have continued to rise... as have violent
<br>
crime rates in Australia as well, since the gun ban took effect there.
<br>
Japan, which is similarly restrictive toward guns, is seeing a similar
<br>
rise in violent crime, along with a rise in suicide.
