<p>Oh, this is such defeatist nonsense, all due respect and all. Most people
<br>
want to live healthier for longer -- go ask them. The problems are
<br>
<p>1) poor education and a lack of personal responsibility in society; most
<br>
people don't realize that there are things that they can do, and don't
<br>
expect to actually have to get off their collective arses to do it in any
<br>
case.
<br>
<p>2) a boatload of baggage, cranks, junk and idiocy that seems to surround any
<br>
discussion of health, let alone life extension, and let's not even talk
<br>
about immortality
<br>
<p>3) basic ingrained human laziness and short-sightedness. Next to no-one
<br>
would save for retirement if the govenment didn't pretty much make them do
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>So my point: practical anti-aging and practical immortality are possible,
<br>
they will happen. It's something that people want, when you get past the
<br>
illogic and contradictory views and lack of awareness and education. This is
<br>
all just like selling any new product (photocopiers, faxes, telephones,
<br>
better mousetraps) that provides a clear and obvious benefit...you have to
<br>
get out there and work damn hard to convince people at the start. People
<br>
don't just start using something or asking for something even if it provides
<br>
a clear and obvious benefit.
<br>
<p>Ok, I'm slipping onto my life-extension activism hobby-horse again. I'll
<br>
stop. After I just say -- again -- that if everyone on this list put as much
<br>
effort into *doing* as they do into *talking about doing* then we'd all be
<br>
getting a lot closer to living forever, transhumanism, etc. It doesn't take
<br>
much more than a couple of hundred dedicated types to engineer a paradigm
<br>
shift over five to ten years or so.
