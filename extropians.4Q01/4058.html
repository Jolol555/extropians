<p>Huh?  I hate to be a killjoy here (potential puns abound) but I've
<br>
got a partially finished paper (that both Spike and Hal have seen
<br>
calculations related to) that suggests a small fraction of the State
<br>
of Texas can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, solar collectors in this efficiency range, as the foundation

</em><br>
<p>No, not, nada, zip.  Unless there is some very wide gap between
<br>
our oil usage and our total energy requirements this assertion
<br>
does not make sense.  We need to stop handwaving here and work
<br>
with actual numbers/citations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even at the 30% efficiencies of the best man made solar panels, this

</em><br>
<p>Mike, I don't disagree with your conclusions if they are based
<br>
upon &quot;realities&quot;.  I fear however that there may be some distance
<br>
between the assumptions and conclusions.  One thing, I believe
<br>
pointed out by others, is that there is a crucial difference
<br>
between &quot;arable land&quot; and &quot;energy harvestable&quot; land.  There is
<br>
a fair amount of land that is non-arable (or depletably arable
<br>
due to fresh water constraints) that can be easily utilized
<br>
with solar (non-water based) technologies or less easily utilized
<br>
with solar/salt-water based hydrogen or methane production.
<br>
<p>I think we should leave the jury in recess until we have some
<br>
more hard data that we all generally agree upon.
<br>
<p>Robert
