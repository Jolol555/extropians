<p>Something a lot of Libertarians seem to avoid thinking about is the 
<br>
fact that the minarchist night-watchman state with unhampered capitalism
<br>
that they crave *has* actually been tried. And found wanting.
<br>
<p>Britain, 1770-1870 or thereabouts. It's near as dammit the minarchist
<br>
state they keep banging on about. No income tax, night-watchman goverment,
<br>
a navy (the main military force) than ran at a profit (by enforcing
<br>
blockades with confiscation of blockade-runner's assets) and so on.
<br>
<p>It was a roaring success for business -- but it wasn't a very nice place
<br>
for ordinary people to live and it sowed the seeds of its own collapse.
<br>
Clue: the pollution was so bad that massive public works had to be created
<br>
to deal with it (read up on The Great Stink of 1853 if you don't believe
<br>
me). Second clue: social conditions were sufficiently bad that *England*
<br>
was where Marx expected the communist revolution to break out. Third
<br>
clue: the libertarian &quot;utopia&quot; of imperial Britain was dismantled from
<br>
the inside out by its own people.
