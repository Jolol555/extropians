<p>We need to be very careful here.  Photosynthetic efficiencies can be
<br>
boosted significantly if one can engineer organisms that selectively
<br>
capture and use photons of specific energies and also develop ways
<br>
to utilize the IR &amp; UV portions of the spectrum.
<br>
<p>As far as the &quot;efficiencies&quot; of small devices goes there is lots
<br>
of room for improvement.  Nature has pushed along one set of vectors
<br>
and in at least one instance (the F0-F1 ATP Synthase enzyme) appears
<br>
to be very close to the limits.  But most of the other enzymes that
<br>
Nature is based on aren't very close.  Part of the problem is that
<br>
the energy currency (ATP) comes in only one value while the amount
<br>
of energy required for different operations may vary significantly.
<br>
<p>It depends what you want to do with the energy.  We know for example,
<br>
that you can compute almost for free.  But if you actually want to
<br>
store a result (that erases bits) you are going to generate heat
<br>
and that limits how quickly you can do the computation without
<br>
expending further energy to remove the heat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To James, I say:  Some laws were meant to be broken.  I firmly believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the laws of thermodynamics are not true laws of nature, but just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a stop-gap milestone in our understanding of the physical world with

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; our physical surroundings.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt it.  Asking for the removal of the laws of thermodynamics
<br>
is, IMO, a pipe dream.  However, the most &quot;limiting&quot; factor we
<br>
seem to be dealing with is energy conversion efficiencies in
<br>
heat engines.  There we have room for improvement from levels of
<br>
~30-35% to ~80-85%.  But as multi-layer solar cells are improved
<br>
and combined into more complex structures it isn't clear how
<br>
good they might get (we are already past the ~30% limits many
<br>
once claimed).  The efficies of electric to mechanical energy
<br>
conversion via electrical motors are already quite high but may
<br>
get even better if we can apply HTSC.
<br>
<p>If you are willing to run your mind on a large reversible
<br>
computer that computes using only latent heat energy for power
<br>
and allows simple conduction or convection to remove the heat
<br>
produced from erasing bits, then you will be able to run very
<br>
very efficiently indeed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My only curiousity is if this breakthrough will occur in my lifetime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the sentiment that you hold, that the laws of thermodynamics are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed strong laws and are a limiting factor, is widespread amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scientific community, then sadly I say I doubt it WILL happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within my lifetime.
</em><br>
<p>I believe the laws of thermodynamics to be very strong but there is
<br>
a wide range for improvement that you should see within your lifetime.
<br>
Think, for example, of biological systems where all of the enzymes
<br>
are redesigned to match the energy denomination used precisely to the
<br>
energy required to drive a reaction forward.
