</em><br>
<p>Within a specific subculture, network marketing has significant legs.
<br>
The problem for you is to find the right first three people to contact
<br>
who already have established 'downlines' in the market you have a
<br>
product for. I can relate to you the experience of a friend of mine in
<br>
that business:
<br>
<p>Bill had been an Amway guy right out of high school. He got hooked on
<br>
the concept, but too naive to realize that particular enterprise had
<br>
matured years ago such that there was significant memetic immunity to it
<br>
in a large segment of the target population, and that the organization
<br>
itself was overpriced and insular, feeding on itself with motivational
<br>
tapes, etc. When he finally realized this, he went off and sought newer
<br>
markets. He did Herbalife, then he hit it big with the water filter
<br>
business of NSF, so that they sent him to open up Germany to the
<br>
product, where he made several hundred thousand in two years. Not bad at
<br>
all for a guy with a high school education.
<br>
He came back to the US to help MCI get its long distance phone service
<br>
network marketed under LCI, but MCI wound up defrauding the enterprise
<br>
and Bill lost a huge chunk of money, to the point that within another
<br>
two years he was sleeping on a friend's couch. He finally hooked up with
<br>
a nutritional supplements organization called Life Plus that had its
<br>
structure set up right, and he, by this time, knew all the heavy hitters
<br>
in the network marketing world, several of whome he recruited to Life
<br>
Plus, thereby establishing a downline of over 40,000 people within 6
<br>
months. By the end of a year he was making $45,000 a month in income
<br>
with no expenses outside of maintaining a 1-800 number for conference
<br>
calls. He is now retired.
<br>
<p>I did some computer work for him, setting him up with his satellite
<br>
internet setup, etc. and he had asked me to go over an article he had
<br>
gotten on a study by the Harvard Business School on the network
<br>
marketing business. Harvard did a good job of analysing it and
<br>
determining what created a successful network marketing enterprise, and
<br>
when was a good time to get in and get out of the business.
<br>
<p>Most network marketing schemes take a minimum of a year to reach a
<br>
critical mass of 'pioneer' members. These are typically people with
<br>
experience in network marketing, who have extensive networks of people
<br>
they have done similar work with in the past. As soon as a critical mass
<br>
of these seeder 'pioneers' join the organization, the growth of the
<br>
network quickly grows in a third order &quot;s&quot; curve pattern, reaching
<br>
market saturation within 3-5 years. If you get into the organization
<br>
within that period, you have a good chance of making a decent profit on
<br>
the system. A successful network should have at least 100,000 members
<br>
within two years of its founding, and over a million within 5 years.
<br>
<p>After that point, though, society in general has developed a sort of
<br>
memetic immunity to the sales pitches of new members, primarly because a
<br>
critical mass of 'naysayers' have gone through the program and not had
<br>
the necessary attributes to be successful at it, so they quit, blaming
<br>
the product and the organization as frauds rather than admit their own
<br>
unfitness for that sort of work. These naysayers are the 'T cells' of
<br>
society, seeding it with &quot;network marketing is a fraud&quot; or &quot;this company
<br>
is full of crooks&quot; memes that specifically help others reject the
<br>
memetic sales pitches of new members.
<br>
<p>At that point, a smart networker will try to find a new product. Not all
<br>
products work in a network marketing scheme. You generally want them to
<br>
be something that makes the customer come back for more on a repeated
<br>
basis. Nutritional supplements, for example, are excellent candidates,
<br>
because people who are into them will order them on a monthly or
<br>
bi-monthly basis to maintain their fitness program. Water filter
<br>
products have to replace the filter elements a few times a year or maybe
<br>
less often, but this is a repeat business.
<br>
<p>The Insurance business works well in the network method, as monthly
<br>
premiums offer perpetual residual income for people in the upline for
<br>
years and decades to come.
<br>
<p>Would literature work in network marketing? I think so, but it would
<br>
require that novels be serialized, I think, or else a large number of
<br>
authors should band together to form a book club that sells at a
<br>
significant discount to members.
<br>
<p>How do you recruit members? Some just want the product and are not
<br>
interested in 'sullying their hands' with trying to hawk a product to
<br>
others. Others are interested only in getting enough of their friends to
<br>
buy it that they  themselves wind up paying nothing. While these two
<br>
groups are a fine end-of-chain customer, those starting a network want
<br>
to recruit people who have significant networks of people who have a
<br>
regard for their opinions, and are similarly motivated to make money
<br>
promoting a good product at a good price.
<br>
<p>There has to be something in it for them, too. You want six levels of
<br>
direct payback in the network that range from 5-15% commission at the
<br>
different levels, plus at least a 1% total network payup on your total
<br>
downline beyond the 6 levels.
<br>
<p>How do you do it online? It works best online as a referral system,
<br>
where each member has a PIN number that new members give when they apply
<br>
to establish them in a downline, so they get their own PIN number as a
<br>
subsidiary of that recruiter. After that point, the referer really
<br>
doesn't need to promote product, push sales, or do any of the sort of
<br>
annoying hard sell BS that typifies pre-1990 network marketing (the
<br>
reason why I call Amway the &quot;Church of the American Way&quot;). Thereafter,
<br>
members just enter their PIN number when ordering product directly from
<br>
the website of the producer, and the computer handles all residuals
<br>
calculations for the entire network.
<br>
<p>Despite the obvious 'snake oil' reputation that many early network
<br>
marketers have established in the general population, selling
<br>
questionable products at inflated &quot;wholesale&quot; prices, I have the firm
<br>
belief that this sort of marketing will predominate as the internet
<br>
further democratizes society, especially once governments get more
<br>
libertarian and start removing special protections that help
<br>
corporations trend toward bigness, and as news channels multiply into a
<br>
cacophanic din of hawkers and pitchmen. At that point, the most credible
<br>
sales people you will know are your best freinds, family, and neighbors.
<br>
<p>No doubt there will be plenty of reactionaries who pine for the days of
<br>
only three network channels and recognisable celebrities that hawked
<br>
recognisable brand names to a trusting audience of drone consumers. I'm
<br>
betting that this group will wane as time goes on.
