</em><br>
<em>&gt; Citizens and foreign nationals pulled in in an open sweep on no

</em><br>
<p>Once again, you are talking out your ear. Almost all were swept up on
<br>
immigration violations. The rest were swept up because they had personal
<br>
interaction with the known hijackers or with other al Qaeda operatives.
<br>
<p>In a war of insurgency, as this one is, there are no front lines to
<br>
'capture' prisoners on. This ain't no Stalag 13, no &quot;Hogan's Heros&quot;,
<br>
lady. Wake up and smell the patchouli. The enemy has infiltrated our
<br>
homeland, they walk among us, dress like us, and try to act like good
<br>
little westernized muslims.
<br>
<p>Of the four particular prisoners I spoke of, who are known to have been
<br>
involved in the 9-11 events, I have absolutely no compunctions about
<br>
using any means to interrogate them. For the rest, I'd give them the
<br>
option of staying here and talking or being shipped home to their own
<br>
government police agencies along with a list of questions to ask. Those
<br>
that talk, and have no probable cause, get released and/or deported (if
<br>
they are breaking immigration law already). As far as I know, there are
<br>
only about 150 of the 800+ still in detention, so our government isn't
<br>
being as extreme as you are trying to make out here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People do not have the right to say &quot;I don't know&quot; without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having their minds tampered with by force to see if maybe they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do know or say they do under such influences and coercion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since when?
</em><br>
<p>Since this is NOT a civilian criminal case. This is a war. They ain't
<br>
the same thing. Intelligence collection, especially in preventing more
<br>
war crimes, is of paramount importance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The majority of these people are not even accused of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge but are brought in just in case they do or in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the government to look like it is doing something, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is wrong, morally questionable and very dangerous to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and civil rights. 
</em><br>
<p>How do you know that?
