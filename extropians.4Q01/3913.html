Eliezer commenting on my genome improvement strategy commented:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This needs to be phrased carefully, since it's not obvious what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage is to the individual of carrying contingency alleles.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but we are *already* carrying around (and paying associated
<br>
costs) for the 90+% junk DNA.  (The only caveat being if the
<br>
junk DNA functions as a free radical sink -- then it is actually
<br>
serving a purpose).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How could Nature design populations rather than individuals?  Well, over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very very long periods of time, the species that exist will tend to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descendants of species that retained adaptive capability and genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flexibility.
</em><br>
<p>That was my point about having chromosome pairs.  It seems probable
<br>
that pairs combined with multiple genetic loci functioning in an
<br>
additive fashion is much easier than dealing with triplet or quadruplet
<br>
chromosome copies.  Chromosome pairs and allelic variation have
<br>
provided enough &quot;adaptive capability&quot; that species can evolve
<br>
and survive.  But that in no way suggests that the genetic memory,
<br>
adaptability or survival capacities are maximized by the specific
<br>
configuration most species on the planet have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this happens through enough generations of species (not just generations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals), there will be some lasting residue of &quot;species fitness&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;evolution of evolvability&quot;, even though locally species will still tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to evolve for maximum individual fitness without regard to future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolvability.
</em><br>
<p>No argument.  The substrate (DNA repair, sex, chromosome pairs, etc.) evolved
<br>
to the point where species survival and individual fitness were sufficient
<br>
to allow life to both survive and evolve.  That in no way suggests that
<br>
we are currently on a maximum extropy vector at this time.  A maximum
<br>
extropy vector requires looking at the environment and determining
<br>
a survivability or information content quotient (these may be orthogonal).
<br>
It requires intelligence to predict future environments (one has to understand
<br>
both laws of physics and the evolution of the universe).  That determines
<br>
the present value of current information and therefore what should be
<br>
preserved for future usefullness.  An even more intelligent valuation
<br>
function determines the cost of recreating the information and when
<br>
precisely it might be needed.  If recreation is cheap and it will not
<br>
be needed in near-time, then discarding it is reasonable.  Nature discards
<br>
information without consideration of its future usefullness.
<br>
<p>I have no problem with Nature having built-in a &quot;foundation&quot; of fitness
<br>
for evolution -- but the hazard function would appear to limit our
<br>
&quot;evolution of evolvability&quot;.  If the hazard function is decreasing
<br>
(Jupiter removing comets) then the pressure to evolve foundations
<br>
that promote the development of species that have enhanced evolvability
<br>
or survivability seems to be diminishing.  There may be a planet in
<br>
the galaxy with no Jupiter, around a larger star (higher UV flux,
<br>
greater energy, faster evolution) in comparison to which we look
<br>
like slow-pokes.  It is an interesting fundamental question --
<br>
what is the substrate that can support the highest rate of evolution
<br>
while preserving the greatest amount of previously generated information.
<br>
