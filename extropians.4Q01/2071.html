<p>Well...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;1.The universe is meaningless and chaotic.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Let's think abt this. If the universe were meaningless and chaotic in the
<br>
sense of `entirely random', and we are critters from an evolved lineage in
<br>
such a universe, why would we `need meaning and structure in our lives'?
<br>
<p>Surely we would tend to be fitted by selection to work happily without
<br>
contrived meaning and structure.
<br>
<p>But the universe is chaotic in the dual senses that (1) simple regularities
<br>
when iterated result in immensely complex outcomes that are hard to `see
<br>
through' or predict, and (2) stuff outside any box is likely to burst in
<br>
and disrupt what is inside the box. Even so, moderately complex critters
<br>
are formed via iteration and retain a high degree of stability and
<br>
heritability. Meaning is therefore, in the first instance, the salience of
<br>
structure and noise  to the persistence and growth of evolved critters. To
<br>
the extent that restricted model-making gadgets like brains have trouble
<br>
locating the relevant structures, true meaning will evade our grasp--and
<br>
might tend to be replaced by stopgap templates drawn from better-understood
<br>
situations (hence animism).
<br>
<p>Here's a bit from my story `The Womb' (in Dann and Webb, DREAMING
<br>
DOWN-UNDER) which tries to catch some of this, although I don't agree
<br>
entirely with Daimon's somewhat solipsistic and delusional opinion:
<br>
<p>=============
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The meaning of it all? Darling, let me tell you what I've learned, what
<br>
the greys have taught me. You won't enjoy hearing this, but it will,' he
<br>
said seriously, `set you free.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was apprehensive.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You're going to say that human life has no meaning,' I told him. I knew
<br>
already that this was his scandalous doctrine, because I had gobbled up a
<br>
couple of potted and scathing magazine exposes of Scionetics in the
<br>
previous days, and I wasn't buying it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He popped the top on a stubby and sucked froth into his mouth. The sun,
<br>
burning down from the north of the sky, caught his UVA-machine-tanned
<br>
forehead, slipped down the laugh lines beside his eyes. He should have been
<br>
wearing a hat, of course, as I was, because the ozone hole was straight
<br>
overhead in Sydney, but he was protected against cancer, he said, by the
<br>
painful ministrations of the Harvesters.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No meaning? Not exactly,' he said. `Okay, the starting point is that
<br>
everyone gets everything arse backwards because they're always facing the
<br>
wrong way. I mean the philosophers, the theologians, the anthropocists, the
<br>
fucking quantum holists, everyone except for a handful of old-fashioned
<br>
semioticians. And even they squibbed when it came to the jump.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Oh dear.' I pushed back the brim of my hat and gazed across the Pacific
<br>
ocean. Sea gulls circled, trying to snatch our fries. `Sorry, this reminds
<br>
me of Valentine and the great truth of Harmonic Resonance.' The comparison,
<br>
risen unbidden, made me shudder. Deems watched me. He did not put his arm
<br>
around me, which was wise at that moment.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Yes,' he said, `we all think we're the first and only ones to understand
<br>
the secret of the universe. I was always suspicious of people who thought
<br>
they knew it all. I loved to take the mickey out of the bastards.' He
<br>
sighed. `I'd still be running about like a perpetual adolescent if the
<br>
Harvesters hadn't told me what's what.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`And what is what?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lolloping dog ran past, spraying us with sand. I threw him a cooling
<br>
chip, and he missed it. What was his notion of the good life? This, surely.
<br>
And what did his doggy mind imagine was the meaning of the world? But we
<br>
were not doggies. We made our own chips and beer and polluted our own
<br>
beaches and cleaned them up if we felt like it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Look at the words we use when we ask the most poignant questions, Flake,'
<br>
my father said. `When your mother abducted you and ran off to the States, I
<br>
raved and flailed and ranted. Why? I screamed. Why did this happen to me? I
<br>
flew to America and tried to find you, and nobody would tell me, and then
<br>
the fucking guru went to ground with all his witless devotees, taking you
<br>
and your mother with him, and I had to come back to Australia, and then I
<br>
was snatched for three weeks by the Harvesters-- Christ, it sounds like a
<br>
bloody soap opera! Well, I ranted and flailed, when they brought me back,
<br>
and spent a lot of time screaming, Why? And when your mother was killed and
<br>
they told you she'd died in a car crash, you probably ran about asking Why,
<br>
why, why?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I was five years old,' I told Deems. `Of course I did.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Okay, what's the common element here? Three different strokes of ill
<br>
fortune, and we keeping asking Why? But that's a question that is only
<br>
appropriately addressed to an intention. Do you see what I mean? Why had
<br>
Margaret stolen you to America? I've thought about this a lot, Angel--'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Rosa,' I said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gulped, and his eyes misted.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Rosa, I was a typical male of my era. Well, not typical, but even so. And
<br>
your mother was a confused but strong woman, and she wasn't going to put up
<br>
with my bullshit. Of course she had to go away. It wasn't me, precisely -
<br>
it was all of us, our stupid culture, the way we find meaning in attachment
<br>
to our kids... She thought Zelda and I were stealing you away from her, and
<br>
she was probably right.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I don't even remember Zelda,' I said in a grainy tone.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You'll meet her tonight, she's looking forward enormously to seeing you.
<br>
But the point is, I wasn't asking for those sorts of answers. I wanted to
<br>
know Why is the universe doing this to me? Why has the plan of my life -
<br>
the central plan of the universe, after all - why has it gone so unfairly
<br>
off the rails? I'm the hero of this fucking movie, right? How dare the
<br>
extras screw with my happy ending?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I suppose we all put ourself in the main role,' I conceded, because
<br>
that's what he wanted me to agree to. But I didn't, not really. My response
<br>
to disappointment and pain and, indeed, intolerable torment had been to
<br>
shrink myself, to split my soul into the colours of the rainbow and hide
<br>
most of the hues in darkness. That's why I've been able to construct this
<br>
history of my father and my mother and myself, don't you see? I'm the
<br>
perfect biographer. I have no self. I'm anyone's. I'm anyone.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Actors spend a lot of time obsessing about Why questions,' Deems said.
<br>
`Motivation. &quot;What's my character's motivation?&quot; They're looking for a few
<br>
simple codes, cues to the impulses and behavioural channels of the
<br>
personality they're about to impersonate. And it's not so strange or hard
<br>
to do that, because evolution built our brains to perform exactly that
<br>
function. It's why people love stories.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We've evolved to be actors?' I stared at him. `I think you've been living
<br>
in Los Angeles too long.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deems laughed gustily. `You're Margaret's daughter all right.' We both
<br>
stared at the horizon for a time. `If you're a horse,' he said then,
<br>
patiently, `your DNA built you to graze in a herd, and avoid lions. If
<br>
you're a lion, your DNA built you to hunt horses in the company of a small
<br>
squadron of other lions. In both cases, you need an internal model of
<br>
social life - your own, and your prey's or predator's. When a horse sees
<br>
the grass sway, it's a considerable benefit if she asks herself horsily,
<br>
Why did that happen? What's its meaning? Lion or wind? Sniff sniff. Freak,
<br>
shit, Lion! Lion! Meaning starts by interpreting as deliberate codes the
<br>
lumpy happenstances of the world.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mused on this. `It's the other way round, isn't it? We interpret the
<br>
meaning that's there. I mean, if a Chinese translator interprets my words
<br>
from English, she's got to start by understanding my meaning and sort of...
<br>
carry it over to the other language?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Okay, both processes entail each other. The grass means food to our
<br>
horsie, and its motion might mean danger, because our horsie means food to
<br>
the lions. So the nutritive values and the possibility of lions are both
<br>
there in the grass, I guess, before any act of interpretation takes place.
<br>
But you can't say they have any meaning, in that exact sense, unless the
<br>
horse is there to start with.' 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Aussie bravos were taking to the frothy water in gaudy wetsuits,
<br>
clambering on to windsurfers. We watched their antics. Their play was as
<br>
meaningless, as arbitrary, as open to an inpouring of significance as a
<br>
whale sounding, as the Budd Hopkins Guardians on my father's Los Angeles'
<br>
walls. For the surfers, its meaning was the joy of sinew and muscle and eye
<br>
doing their stuff, the body's balance sustained against the chaotic
<br>
turbulence of the sea. I sighed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I mentioned two other cases,' Deems said. `My three-week abduction, and
<br>
your mother's death. Why did they happen? What was the meaning?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent him a sidelong glance. `Well, I don't even know if it did happen.
<br>
Your disappearance. Sorry.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gazed back without expression. `It doesn't matter, you see. Call it a
<br>
metaphor, if you like.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was relieved. `All right.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The answer is, there is no meaning to either event - in the usual,
<br>
human-centred sense. Something happens, okay. A tree falls over in the
<br>
forest. All sorts of factors led up to that event - the rain has weakened
<br>
the soil, the tree's DNA program has closed down its growth cycle so it's
<br>
gone rotten inside, the wind has picked up because of the accidental
<br>
arrangement of snow and cloud halfway around the world. So it's all
<br>
explicable, down to the level of atoms if you had time enough to track it
<br>
all. But it's not part of any plan. And if you happen to be walking under
<br>
the tree at that moment and it squashes you flat, all we can say is - &quot;shit
<br>
happens&quot;.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Or: don't walk under trees. That might be one meaning.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A meaning we read into the sad event, sure. We don't draw it out, we put
<br>
it in. That's what our brains are good at - making up stories, scripts,
<br>
schemata. The cognitive scientists have a whole batch of words for this
<br>
stuff. All of it boils down to one hard fact: we love to write the universe
<br>
into a text, and then to interpret it as if someone else had written it.
<br>
That's okay. Horses do it, lions do it, the birds and bees do it.' He
<br>
grinned wickedly. `It's only when we start to fetishise our little knack
<br>
that it goes crazy and cancerous and eats us up from the inside. We start
<br>
looking for meaning everywhere, forgetting that we're the ones who put it
<br>
there.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was getting chilly, and I felt sorry for those guys out there on their
<br>
windsurfers. But then nobody was forcing them to do it. We stood up and
<br>
stretched, shook sand off the blanket by holding one corner of it each,
<br>
handed the folded bundle to one of Daimon's patient bodyguards who took it
<br>
back to the car. In the froth at the edge of the sea I noticed two or three
<br>
limp, diaphanous jellyfish. I bent down to stir them with my finger, and
<br>
drew back in disgust. They were condoms, washing about in the sandy foam.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Daimon, this sounds like the crappy New Age solipsism I grew up with.
<br>
&quot;You create your own universe&quot;. I'm sorry, but that's the worst kind of
<br>
hypocrisy.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No, no,' my father said placidly, placing his big-toed feet carefully in
<br>
someone else's line of footsteps in the sand. He had to hop a little. `All
<br>
we create is our own meaning. The world, other people, our own inaccessible
<br>
inward systems - all of that provides the building materials, and the
<br>
landscape for the architect to work in. But the meaning we end up with is a
<br>
construct of our minds. It has no necessary connection to the actual
<br>
priorities of the universe.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Which are?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed softly. `Which have nothing to do with us, I'm sorry to say.'
