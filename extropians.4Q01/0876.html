<em>&gt; Why?  We would still get cold.  Did you mean we would have zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privacy?  Im already over that.
</em><br>
<p>I don't mean to have my statements construed as supporting privacy. I wish to make the point that such changes to open up full information flow may require a very significant lifestyle change, and so much that we might have our cultural notions turned upside down and might need to set up a new variety of society to function. Not wearing clothes (for the purpose of concealment) would surely qualify as one of such possible changes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; At some time future we reach the point where anyone can slay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone.  At that time, I do not expect anyone would be banging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right to privacy drum.  As that day approaches, how do we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide how much privacy should be ensured?  spike
</em><br>
<p>I vote for the Global Mind Link and full disclosure. Meanwhile, we have to consider those unwilling to take part in such an experience, and perhaps setting up a new colony where we can live without worrying about terrorists and other anti-progressive behavior would provide the best solution.
