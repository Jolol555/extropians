<em>&gt; &gt; Well, it seems to suggest a simplification of the issue. Start reading

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some understanding of the complexities affecting islamic society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would advise people to read this and some of the linked articles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will make more sense than discussing whether or not the US has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed injustice here and there, and thinking that this is the Real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Problem We Face Now. It's not. Some of you are really confusing your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral concerns with their concerns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If the fact that we ourselves or rather our CIA practices real
<br>
terrorism supposedly in our interest but who knows since almost
<br>
all of it is hidden, does not concern all of us morally, then I
<br>
don't know what in the hell would.  The point is not some
<br>
wimpish caring about morality when we should be ripping and
<br>
snorting to kill enemies (whoever the hell they are).  It is
<br>
concern that we are ignoring a large part of how we got here and
<br>
what it would take to really have different outcomes.   What
<br>
this or that extremist group offers as its own rhetoric does not
<br>
change the fundamental fact that the situation is much much more
<br>
complex than just a bunch of crazed fanatics wanting to destroy
<br>
us from blind dogma and nothing else.  There are people like
<br>
that in the world but they cannot gather all that much support,
<br>
aid and followers unless there are other significant factors at
<br>
work.  We ignore them at our peril and the peril of this world.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Which doesn't mean, as Samantha stressed, that we shouldn't pay the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utmost attention to behave morally and in such a way that favours the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishment of an order respectful and favourable to everyone. In this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;war&quot; and in any other context.
</em><br>
<p>Any war against terrorism must include the terrorism our own
<br>
people have practiced, practice now and will continue to
<br>
practice unless we recognize it and neutralize it.  Otherwise we
<br>
are simply being lying hypocrites.
