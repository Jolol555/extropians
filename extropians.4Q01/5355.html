Damien,
<br>
<p>Was this devilishly difficult test designed mainly by one person, or was it shaped over many years of various profs making it harder and harder??
<br>
<p>I would think only a handful of the most widely read professors of history and literature would have ANY chance of passing this test if no prior preparation were allowed!!
<br>
<p>As I gaped in horror at the test I thought of an article I read(In the Sunday Parade supplement) about a rather interesting man who had grown up on an out-of-the-way farm in Appalachia.  Between his parents and the local library he read *several thousand(I think around seven thousand!)* of the greatest classics of world literature and history!!  
<br>
<p>This man had led a very quiet and secluded life until he was *discovered&quot; in his mid-forties as a goldmine of fascinating insights.  A local university now has taken him in.  I wonder how he would do with this test! lol
<br>
