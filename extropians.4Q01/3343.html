<em>&gt; &gt; I mean, would *you* want to visit a European state where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government had passed regulations saying that basically you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relinquished all rights to due process of law by entering their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; borders, and if they felt like it they could have you arrested,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tried by a military tribunal, and executed on the spot with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; appeal?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; If I were attempting to overthrow that government or even merely trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to engage in a propaganda war to destroy the hypothetical high trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society of that hypothetical european country, I would expect such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measures as a matter of course. My revolutionary cabal's plans may even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *require* that such measures be enacted, on the theory that they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engender mistrust and resentment enough to engender further support from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;useful idiots&quot; in that part of the local intelligentsia who engage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in arguments of moral equivilancy in order to shround their lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility as citizens.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, Mike, but when trials are closed, it's too easy to accuse
<br>
anyone of being anything, whether they are or not.  PUBLIC trials
<br>
for all offenses are a fundamental human right everywhere, under
<br>
all conditions, without exception.  Anyone who proposes closed
<br>
trials for any reason is an enemy of freedom and justice.
<br>
<p>There are certainly some aspects of the American judicial system
<br>
that can be changed: jury selection, rules of evidence, many
<br>
procedural details.  But openness isn't one of them: if anything,
<br>
American trials should be _more_ open: ALL of them, including
<br>
those for suspected foreign terrorists.
