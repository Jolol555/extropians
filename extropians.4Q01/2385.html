<em>&gt; Hey Mike L, why don't you re-tell your HERF gun story?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, okay:
<br>
<p>I was a low rank dweeb in the USAF, working as an electrician on fighter
<br>
jets (F-15s) when I came across a funny little book at a mall in Tacoma
<br>
by a fellow named Thomas Pawlicki titled &quot;Build your own UFO&quot;. Thomas
<br>
lived up in Victoria, BC, so on sightseeing trip up there, I looked him
<br>
up to ask some questions about his writing. As a result, he clued me
<br>
onto a bunch of US patents by various people like TT Brown, Alexander de
<br>
Severski, etc which I found interesting but not entirely convincing.
<br>
This was the late 80's and I'd always had a lighthearted interest in
<br>
UFOs and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Goode's &quot;Above Top
<br>
Secret&quot; had come out and all the talk about the Majestic 12 and Area 51
<br>
and Roswell was coming out and had not been debunked at all. I knew
<br>
several fellows who had previously served in Area 51 who said they'd
<br>
seen stuff there that made the stealth fighter look like a WWI biplane.
<br>
<p>Anyways, as a result of all this, I got interested in playing with very
<br>
high voltage devices. I built an HV power supply that generated 150,000
<br>
volts and a model of de Severski's 'Ionocraft' which I powered by
<br>
umbilical cord with the HV power supply, and was able to make it fly
<br>
around the barracks to the amazement of others (high enough to not be
<br>
ground effect, but only a few feet when the weight of the umbilical
<br>
exceeded the thrust of the ionocraft.)
<br>
<p>I obtained a copy of Information Ulimited's publication &quot;Phazers,
<br>
Lasers, and other Space Age Devices&quot; (where I had obtained the plans for
<br>
the HV power supply), which also had plans for a herf generator of
<br>
rather tame capacity. I took their plans and essentially scaled things
<br>
up a bit based on some tricks I'd learned are used in military radar
<br>
jammers (which I'd once witnessed had spectacularly fried the radar gun
<br>
of an MP who wasn't thinking things through in trying to clock an F-15
<br>
flying overhead). 
<br>
<p>I obtained some surplus equipment from Boeing Surplus Co. (a very cool
<br>
place to shop, south of Seattle) in the order of some thermos sized
<br>
charge capacitors and a large directional radio horn that is essentially
<br>
a larger version of what you find in a radar detector. I bought a bunch
<br>
of surplus radar detectors, hand held radios, and other cheap electronic
<br>
devices to use as my 'crash test dummies'.
<br>
<p>Eventually I got it set up to discharge a nice herf beam in a loci away
<br>
from the horn a hundred or so yards in length, and set up to do so upon
<br>
triggering by a radar detector getting a full strength signal from a
<br>
cop's radar gun.
<br>
<p>At this time, I installed the setup in the back of my pickup truck. I
<br>
had a canopy top on the bed, with a plexiglass window in the back,
<br>
through which the device would shoot its herf beam directly backwards. I
<br>
went out for a drive on some back country New Mexico roads (I had been
<br>
transferred to Cannon AFB since I started the project) trolling for
<br>
speed traps. I picked a cop up on my tail, he nailed me with his radar,
<br>
whereupon all of the electronics in his car, including the engine
<br>
control computer and his radios, fried, and he just kinda puttered out
<br>
and pulled over as I sped off into the sunset.
