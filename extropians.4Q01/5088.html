<em>&gt;I very much agree with this.  While I despise unfounded racism and other

<em>&gt;forms of group discrimination (people should be dealt with on an individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level...not as a group), I also think that there is a need for diversity of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;of intentions or not.  While I don't think that was what Eliezer was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposing in his recent post, such assimilation *seems* (and I stress that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;other problems with some singularity theories, but I will delve into those

<em>&gt;&gt;   Our present irrational concerns about race will be

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;diverge and speciate and migrate to the point where what are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;perceived as &quot;racial&quot; differences will be of less magnitude than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the individual differences we will be able to create. As we grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;apart, it will be all the more important that we learn how to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;advantage of diversity and comparative advantage so that the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;races we become will continue to work effectively toward even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;greater diversity and creativity as we expand into the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps I am wrong, but this seems to me to be far more realistic than any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other scenario I have heard.  Whether or not you find this scenario ideal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or not is an entirely different question, but if you look at the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history has gone and look at how people are *now* in this technologically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advanced age, I have little doubt that races, cultures and other groups 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will diverge as opposed to converge; if some cultures cannot agree with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each other in this day and age, perhaps humanity will be better off with a 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>It seems to be that what is happening in the USA is that special
<br>
interest groups (mostly business lobbies) are taking advantage of the
<br>
fact that few citizens vote and of the fact that there are so many
<br>
different ethnic groups with differing interests, in order to buy off
<br>
the politicians and influence the media.
<br>
<p>That is one big reason why I am against culturai diversity--divide and
<br>
be conquered...by the lobbyists.
