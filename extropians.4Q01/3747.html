<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky commented:
<br>
<p>Leaving aside the pre-Singularity/FDA issues (i.e: no way), let's not
<br>
forget that this alleged divide between rich and poor is primarily a
<br>
Luddite memetic plot.  A trick like this does not make the rich richer, it
<br>
makes the rich's children more intelligent.  Is this bad for the poor?  I
<br>
think emphatically NOT.  It's stupid people with power that are the
<br>
threat.
<br>
<p>### Since the initial uses of implanted embryonic stem cells would be for
<br>
treatment of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative disorders, as well as
<br>
stroke, obtaining FDA approval should be possible, as long as the treatments
<br>
were reliably effective and safe. This is a pre-Singularity technology, and
<br>
some initial, related work is already under way, e.g. Dr Kondziolka from
<br>
UPMC Presbyterian did some trials of cell (not stem) implantations into
<br>
stroke patients.
<br>
<p>Treating Alzheimer's is in fact IQ boosting - interfering with the natural
<br>
downward trajectory which our capabilities follow as we age. Once the
<br>
treatment works for demented patients, there is just a small step to
<br>
treating patients with MCI (mild cognitive impairment), then just another
<br>
step to IQ augmentation in MR (mental retardation), then everybody will
<br>
claim his child is retarded enough to qualify for treatment - and we will
<br>
have widespread use of IQ augmentation in no time (as long as it is
<br>
technically possible). If there is a ready supply of cells implantable in
<br>
everybody (regardless of histocompatibility), the procedure should be
<br>
reasonably priced.
<br>
<p>So I agree with Robert regarding the prospects for clinical applications
<br>
coming realtively soon (5-10 years), and I agree with Eliezer that the
<br>
ethical issues will not be a showstopper.
