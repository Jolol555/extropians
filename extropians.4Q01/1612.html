Someone recently posted a link to an article about a method of powering
<br>
large buildings with wind turbines.  I glanced briefly at the article,
<br>
and meant to make a note of the link, but unfortunately apparently did
<br>
not.  I haven't been able to find anything on it in the archives, either,
<br>
but I think it's there somewhere.  If anyone has the link to the article,
<br>
or knows anything else about it, I'd appreciate it if you'd email me
<br>
off-list at douglassbill@yahoo.com.
<br>
<p>The article featured at least one illustration of a building with a sort
<br>
of organic, smooth design, with some wind turbines nestled comfortably
<br>
in the middle.  Unless I dreampt it, I know I came across the article
<br>
reference on this list.  Again, I'd really appreciate a link or any information
<br>
anyone has.
<br>
<p>Best to all,
<br>
<p>Bill Douglass
