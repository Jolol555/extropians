<em>&gt; &gt; Competition due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overcrowding exacerbates conflict, in a neighborhood, state country or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; region. One person's gain is another's loss. Given one pie--be it finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natural resources or available full-time jobs--adding additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consumers must be at the expense of others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't this statement in contradiction to the assumption that improved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology will provide more pie - pardon, resources - for all?
</em><br>
<p>That assumption works well in many casses, except that historically (and
<br>
predictably) people use new technology (such as medicine) to extend their
<br>
lives and to reduce mortality, thus adding to overpopulation. It's more
<br>
popular to use technology to save lives than it is to use technology to create
<br>
more and better widgets, so while greedy and selfish (according to liberals)
<br>
capitalists continue to develop more amazing gagetry, government and
<br>
foundation funding goes to institutions which promise to cure disease, etc.
<br>
We could reduce the overcrowding problem by slowing human reproduction, but
<br>
there's still only so much real estate available on Earth. Some say the
<br>
solution is to colonize other planets or to live in space, while others say
<br>
extraterrestrial migration constitutes pollution of the universe. Furthermore,
<br>
providing more &quot;resources&quot; also means providing more opportunity for crime.
<br>
The industrial revolution made possible machine guns used by gangsters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that history has shown that this is possible, but only if we use technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wisely with the profit for all in mind.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it may be possible, and it's more possible for people to believe this
<br>
than it is for people to accomplish it. The wise use of technology implies
<br>
comparable wise use of the technologists who create it, and nobody really
<br>
likes the idea of being used, wisely or otherwise. So, there will always be
<br>
rogue technologists, as witness the abundance of hackers on the Internet.
<br>
Sometimes it looks like there's more computer virus technology going around
<br>
than there is useful programming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;limited resources theory&quot; does not explain the higher rates of violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes in the US compared to countries with the same standard of living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Europe, Japan, Australia) -
</em><br>
<p>IMO, gun ownership doesn't explain it either. America differs from Europe,
<br>
Japan, and Australia in many ways, not just the American right to bear arms.
<br>
...and I've noticed that there are more Europeans, Japanese, and Australians
<br>
migrating to the US than the other way 'round. So, perhaps people prefer a
<br>
certain amount of violence combined with the freedom it seems to announce,
<br>
than the crime-free atmosphere of places lacking other kinds of liberty. The
<br>
wild West ain't the safest place in the world, but it may be the most open and
<br>
unfettered. Guess that's why more folks immigrate than emigrate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; unless you propose that Americans &quot;need&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly more resources than others (cf. population density,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollution, etc.).
</em><br>
<p>Oh yeah, that might explain it... the Yanks need libenschraum, elbow room...
<br>
more land of the free and more homes of the brave...
<br>
Do you ever find yourself feeling that way?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IMO, the ideology of limited resources we have to fight about is only good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for extremists (left or right) who prefer to steal from others, instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploring new opportunities.
</em><br>
<p>I'm all for exploring new opportunities, and for creating more resources.
<br>
That's why I prefer science to politics and laugh at the oxymoron &quot;political
<br>
science.&quot;
<br>
Of course it's convenient to dismiss real problems and run off to explore
<br>
supposed opportunities somewhere else, isn't it? With overcrowding comes more
<br>
and more explorers who compete for the supposed new opportunities. IMO, the
<br>
ideology of stealing new opportunities instead of repairing and maintaining
<br>
what we have is only good for crackpots who deny the work that is necessary
<br>
for real success.
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual

uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
