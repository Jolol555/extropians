Greetings all!
<br>
<p>re: photochemical advances/photosynthetic efficiency -
<br>
<p>It would seem to me that even if (&amp; this is a pretty big if) no one comes up
<br>
with a chlorophyll or photosynthesis hack that is able to raise the
<br>
efficiency rate from it's current lack lustre performance there are still
<br>
uses for photosynthetic energy production by simply putting the damn stuff
<br>
to use everywhere. So little of &quot;civilised&quot; landmass is used for energy
<br>
production despite the huge demand and by making all our building surfaces
<br>
(and buildings themselves) energy producers, even at crappy efficiency
<br>
rates, we are reducing our reliance on other, possibly polluting or non
<br>
renewable energy resources. I recommend Bruce Sterling's excellent piece on
<br>
&quot;Newer York&quot; as published in Wired
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.01/futuretekture.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.01/futuretekture.html</a> as a nice look at
<br>
how relatively inefficient energy sources (like photosynthesis, heat sinks
<br>
and piezoelectric) that are inbuilt into standardised architecture can help
<br>
relieve the energy burdens of 21c first world humanity in an ecologically
<br>
sound way. The Veridiandesign homepage also has links &amp; articles along these
<br>
lines at <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/">http://www.viridiandesign.org/</a>. Unfortunately few governments on
<br>
any level (local, state, federal etc) and even fewer corporations take long
<br>
term habitation planning seriously - one only has to look at the awesome
<br>
nightmare of my home town Sydney (motorway exhaust stack &amp; a carcinoma to go
<br>
anyone? or would you rather the spectacular array of heavy metals in our
<br>
shellfish or dioxin/PCB's/cadmium on the Olympic site?) to see just how
<br>
desperately some real thought is needed in urban &amp; rural power integration
<br>
as well as overall planning and design. 
<br>
<p>re: nanotech/society of superabundance - 
<br>
<p>Granted that there are pretty spectacular money making opportunities in
<br>
nanotech and other superabundance technologies in the short to medium term,
<br>
but what happens to our economic &amp; societal structures when superabundance
<br>
technology is accessible by the majority of humanity/post humanity? These
<br>
technologies would seem to spell the end of any current notions of wealth,
<br>
something that I can't see those at the top of the economic food chain being
<br>
too happy about...
<br>
<p>See you in the future!
