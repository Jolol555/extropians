<em>&gt;&gt; were pointing out the tremendous gains in productivity that were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; being attributed to the application of information technologies

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; P/E ratios or risk losing the lottery?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the Greenspan economy, which was based on the then, West German
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic idea of fighting inflation first was what highlighted the 1990's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic boom. Greenspan was confident, as his German intellectual
</em><br>
forebears,
<br>
<em>&gt; that if one fights inflation and thus, refuses to permit the normal
</em><br>
economic
<br>
<em>&gt; cycle to close, one can have sustained growth.
</em><br>
<p>The lowering of the interest rates during the mid to late 1990s shows that,
<br>
even if Greenspan's rhetoric had been anti-inflationary, the Fed's actions
<br>
were pro-inflation.
<br>
<p>That said, the problem of measuring inflation has to be dealt with.
<br>
Unfortunately, the usual economic indicators are not the best way to measure
<br>
inflation.  Why?  Well, inflation generally effects not overall price level
<br>
but relative prices.  This is because inflation takes time to move through
<br>
the whole economy and because some prices are more flexible than others.
<br>
(For examples of price flexibility differences, consumer electronics tend to
<br>
be less flexible in price than, say, sweet crude oil.)
<br>
<p>I bring this up because the Fed could low interest rates below the market
<br>
rate -- i.e., inflate -- but, because it is looking at the wrong set of
<br>
indicators at the wrong time think it is not inflating.  (Likewise with
<br>
deflation.  This is only another argument for a free banking system and
<br>
against a centralized or government controlled one.  See the works by Dowd
<br>
and other I cited in my reply to Robert Bradbury.)  So, even if the Fed had
<br>
the best of intentions, it might botch the job.  I think this is what
<br>
happened, since I believe most of the inflation went into the technology
<br>
sector.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Caveat: One clearly cannot do this during a fuel price game by OPEC, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national emergency, like we are experiencing with this Islamist War.
</em><br>
<p>What would constitute, for you, conditions under which one can do this?
<br>
There will always be some crisis the Fed or other regulators can blame if
<br>
their plans and policies don't work out...  I'm not being sarcastic here,
<br>
but just trying to avoid people falling on such crises or emergencies as the
<br>
crutch for bad institutions, policies, or decisions.
<br>
<p>Also, OPEC has pretty much stabilized its oil prices.  The prices have not
<br>
gone up much lately and actually lowered a little.  (Some of this is no
<br>
doubt because of tapping into the US Strategic Oil Reserves...)  In fact, as
<br>
others pointed out (and corrected my mistake in earlier posts), a major part
<br>
of the increase in some oil products' (e.g., gasoline) prices has more to do
<br>
with increased taxes and other US domestic regulatory measures (such as fuel
<br>
additives and the closures of many refineries due to new regulations and
<br>
costs imposed).
<br>
<p>In the long run, if OPEC raises prices too much, it will create problems for
<br>
itself as other sources of oil and energy as well as conservation measures
<br>
will become more economical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, the hurd instinct which rules the stock market, affected it weakest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link, the dot.coms, last year.
</em><br>
<p>Part of the problem is the Fed's policies have encouraged more risk taking
<br>
than the market can support.  Since it was inflating, it was helping people
<br>
to make bad investments.  There was too much money out there to invest.  A
<br>
tighter policy would have avoided some of this.  (A free market in banking
<br>
would have been optimal.)  This is known as the moral hazard problem.  If
<br>
you create the conditions for wreckless behavior, don't be surprised if you
<br>
get wreckless behavior.:/
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My repeated suggestions for placing energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security first, is also a way of tamping down on OPEC oil shennanigans,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; liberating ourselves from their greed and stupidity.
</em><br>
<p>How would you recommend doing this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This may have a salutory psychological effect on its own, in knowing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America's energy-economic future is on a firmer footing.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so.  Of course, most US oil, IIRC, does not come from the Middle East.
<br>
(Other OPEC nations, such as Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and Venezuela I'm
<br>
not sure about.  I've heard figures touted that more than half of the US's
<br>
oil is domestic.  No time to look this up right now.  Would someone else
<br>
care to?  Thanks in advance!)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
