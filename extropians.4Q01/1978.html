<br>
<p><p>PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Oct. 13 ‹ A thousand years ago, in the days of the 
<br>
camel caravans, storytellers gathered here in the tea shops and brought 
<br>
the outside world and all its thoughts and ideas to the bazaar. As the 
<br>
vendors hawked silk, spice and rich tapestries and traders herded beasts 
<br>
through streets thick with smoke from cooking fires, travelers from 
<br>
distant lands and differing religions told stories about moguls, magic, 
<br>
wit and wisdom. In time, the bazaar came to be known as Qissa Khwani ‹ 
<br>
the Bazaar of the Storytellers. 
<br>
<p><p>Now, the streets are still choked with donkey carts, and meat still 
<br>
sizzles on open pits, but the vendors are poor men selling simple things. 
<br>
Blaring car horns drown out all other sound, just as the teachers and 
<br>
students in the Islamic seminaries that surround this bazaar have drowned 
<br>
out all conflicting ideas, all unacceptable thoughts. 
<br>
<p><p>The storytellers no longer come. There is just one story now, at least 
<br>
one acceptable story. It is the one taught in the seminaries, called 
<br>
madrassas, that have become incubators in Pakistan for the holy warriors 
<br>
who say they will die to defend Islam and their hero, Osama bin Laden, 
<br>
from the infidels. In many of the 7,500 madrassas in Pakistan, inside a 
<br>
student body of 750,000 to a million, students learn to recite and obey 
<br>
Islamic law, and to distrust and even hate the United States. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Jihad,&quot; shouted a little boy, from a high window in a madrassa just 
<br>
steps from the Khwani Bazaar. He grinned and waved as foreign journalists 
<br>
snapped his photograph, but, on the streets below, older students had 
<br>
massed for demonstrations that would end in clouds of tear gas and smoke 
<br>
from burning tires, as young men jumped through fire to prove their faith 
<br>
and ferocity. 
<br>
<p><p>President Bush and diplomats from the West have taken great pains to 
<br>
point out that the war on Mr. bin Laden and the Taliban of Afghanistan is 
<br>
not a war on Islam, but in many madrassas here in Pakistan ‹ especially 
<br>
those near the border with Afghanistan ‹ militant Muslims lecture 
<br>
students that the United States is a nation of Christians and Jews who 
<br>
are not after a single terrorist or government but are bent on the 
<br>
worldwide annihilation of Islam. 
<br>
<p><p>The madrassas' sword is in the narrow education they offer, and the 
<br>
devotion they engender from students from the poorest classes who, 
<br>
without them, would have nowhere to go, or go hungry. 
<br>
<p><p>At the Markaz Uloom Islamia madrassa in Peshawar, Muhammad Sabir, 22, 
<br>
motioned to the eerily quiet compound, devoid of students. Final exams 
<br>
are over, he said. The scholars, many of them, have left to fight against 
<br>
the United States. &quot;They have gone for jihad,&quot; said Mr. Sabir, a student 
<br>
there. &quot;It is our moral and religious duty.&quot; He said the words 
<br>
automatically, woodenly, as if repeating his elder's recitation of the 
<br>
Koran. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;There is no practical training of terrorists here,&quot; said Asif Qureishi, 
<br>
an Islamic scholar and the son of Maulana Mohd Yousaf Qureishi, who heads 
<br>
the Darul-Uloom Ashrafia madrassa in Peshawar. There are no weapons, no 
<br>
knives or guns, no weapons training. The madrassas hone only the mind, he 
<br>
said. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;We prepare them for the jihad, mentally,&quot; said Mr. Qureishi, whose 
<br>
duties at the madrassa include the call to prayers. In a small room at 
<br>
the madrassa, students nodded appreciatively at his words. Some were no 
<br>
more than 10. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;The minds are fresh,&quot; he said. In his tiny office, a bag of rice rests 
<br>
against a wall. Outside the door, a student hefts the carcass of a 
<br>
slaughtered goat. 
<br>
<p><p>What the students hear, in compounds that range from spartan to squalid, 
<br>
is a drumbeat of American injustice, cruelty and closed-mindedness ‹ the 
<br>
United States is just that way, the elders say. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;They send cruise missiles against gravestones,&quot; said Al-Sheikh Rahat 
<br>
Gul, the stick-thin, 81-year-old maulana who heads Markaz Uloom Islamia 
<br>
in Peshawar, a madrassa with about 250 students. 
<br>
<p><p>The Americans kill only innocents, said the maulana, a large pair of 
<br>
thick-lensed, black-framed glassed sitting crookedly on his head. &quot;The 
<br>
Koran forbids the killing of females, children, elders and cattle,&quot; he 
<br>
said. &quot;That is war. That is not holy war.&quot; Sons of Islam must answer that 
<br>
tyranny with holy war, he said. 
<br>
<p><p>He condemns the World Trade Center attack but dismisses any connection to 
<br>
this part of the world. &quot;The Jews have done this,&quot; he said, calling the 
<br>
attacks a plot by Israel to draw the world into war. &quot;And the Hindus are 
<br>
just like them.&quot; It is repeated madrassa by madrassa, the company line of 
<br>
the militants and the poorer classes from which they come, spreading out 
<br>
from the student body to the shops and foot traffic. 
<br>
<p><p>Maulana Gul proudly points to a cartoon on the back of a pamphlet at his 
<br>
madrassa that shows Afghanistan encircled by a chain, and the chain is 
<br>
secured by a padlock that is labeled &quot;United Nations.&quot; Inside the chain 
<br>
are weeping children. Hands reach from all directions with offerings of 
<br>
food, money and grain, hands are grabbed at the wrist by other hands 
<br>
labeled &quot;U.S.A.,&quot; preventing that aid from getting to the starving people. 
<br>
<p><p>In the madrassas, students ranging in age from 7 or 8 to men over 20 are 
<br>
taught a strict interpretation of the Koran, including the duty of all 
<br>
Muslims to rise up in jihad. There are no televisions and some madrassas 
<br>
do not even allow transistor radios. There are no magazines or newspapers 
<br>
except those deemed acceptable by the elders. The outside world is closed 
<br>
to them, and many of the students seem puzzled when asked if they mind 
<br>
that. Their teachers, most of them respected elders, tell them what they 
<br>
need to know, the students said. 
<br>
<p><p>Almost all the leadership of the Taliban, including Mullah Muhammad Omar, 
<br>
was educated in madrassas in Pakistan ‹ most of them in a single 
<br>
madrassa, Jamia Darul Uloom Haqqania in Akora Khatak in the Northwest 
<br>
Frontier Province of Pakistan. The anti-American protests that have 
<br>
filled the streets in Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi have been 
<br>
planned in madrassas ‹ their maulanas, the elders who run the schools, 
<br>
are the spiritual hub of the protests. 
<br>
<p><p>In Quetta, after the United States began its missile attacks on the 
<br>
Taliban, 300 Afghans who had attended madrassas in Pakistan crossed the 
<br>
border to join the jihad. Every day, said madrassa students, Pakistanis 
<br>
slip over the border to join them. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;The madrassas indulge in brainwashing on a large scope, of the young 
<br>
children and those in their early teens,&quot; said Arasiab Khattak, chairman 
<br>
of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, who stressed it is unfair to 
<br>
say that all madrassas are the same. Some are more militant than others. 
<br>
<p><p>But along the border with Afghanistan, the vast majority of madrassas 
<br>
have become an assembly line for the jihad. Even the scholars themselves 
<br>
and their teachers say that this is so. 
<br>
<p><p>Almost all the students come from poor families who cannot afford any 
<br>
other education in a country that spends about 90 percent of its budget 
<br>
on debt service and the military and almost nothing on public schools. 
<br>
<p><p>A large family, said Mr. Khattak, often sends two or three sons to a 
<br>
madrassa because it cannot afford to feed them. &quot;There is no access to 
<br>
the regular education system,&quot; he said. 
<br>
<p><p>The madrassas, often supported by donors from other Islamic states like 
<br>
Saudi Arabia, offer a narrow education ‹ many of them do not teach 
<br>
science, math, languages or any history beyond that in the Koran ‹ but do 
<br>
offer students food and a place to sleep. In madrassas, children from the 
<br>
hardest poverty in Pakistan and orphans from wars in Afghanistan, get 
<br>
enough to eat. 
<br>
<p><p>Here, the difference between poverty and wealth is apparent on a person's 
<br>
feet. If someone wears sandals made of leather, they have at least some 
<br>
wealth. The poorest wear mass-produced sandals made of plastic. At the 
<br>
doors to the madrassas here ‹ no one enters any office or classroom 
<br>
wearing shoes ‹ rows of plastic sandals sit just outside the doors. 
<br>
<p><p>There have been madrassas in Pakistan for hundreds of years, austere 
<br>
stone and brick schools ‹ built around a mosque ‹ where students spend as 
<br>
many as eight years being instructed in the Koran. They learn by 
<br>
parroting their mullahs, who recite the Koran. There are no questions, no 
<br>
discussion. 
<br>
<p><p>In the past quarter-century, said experts on the madrassas, jihad has 
<br>
become more than a lesson to recite. 
<br>
<p><p>In the 1980's, students left these madrassas to fight against the Soviet 
<br>
Union in Afghanistan ‹ including many Pakistanis, some of whom have an 
<br>
ethnic and tribal kinship to the Afghans. In the 1990's students became 
<br>
foot soldiers and leaders in the Taliban. Now, they form an army around 
<br>
Osama bin Laden. 
<br>
<p><p>In the hours after the attacks on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 
<br>
students described how they ran through the sprawling Jamia Darul Uloom 
<br>
Haqqania compound celebrating, stabbing the fingers on one hand into the 
<br>
palm of the other, to simulate a plane stabbing into a building. 
<br>
<p><p>The morning after the attacks, elders at the madrassa, which translates 
<br>
to &quot;The University of All Righteous Knowledge,&quot; summoned students to 
<br>
study hall. The elders explained what had happened. &quot;No, no, not 
<br>
Muslims,&quot; said Fazal Ghani, 22, an Afghan, as he passed on his teachers' 
<br>
explanation of who had caused the deaths of thousands. &quot;This was Yehudi,&quot; 
<br>
the Jews. &quot;trying to discredit Islam.&quot; He tried to express his sympathy 
<br>
for the victims of the bombings, saying &quot;Bad, bad,&quot; but he could not stop 
<br>
smiling. 
<br>
<p><p>His teachers had explained that, even though the Jews flew the planes 
<br>
into the towers, it was Allah's will. Allah, the teachers said, put the 
<br>
idea in the minds of the Jews. 
<br>
<p><p>Allah, in his wisdom, knew that the Muslims would perhaps be briefly 
<br>
discredited, the students said, but that when the truth came out, it 
<br>
would ultimately destroy the Jews. 
<br>
<p><p>Radios are allowed at this madrassa, and some of the students had held 
<br>
radios to their ears all night, listening to news reports. But that was 
<br>
just noise, just electricity. The truth, the only truth, came from the 
<br>
madrassa's teachers. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;The wrath of God,&quot; the teachers had said. 
<br>
<p><p>But until recent violent demonstrations in Pakistan ‹ planned in the 
<br>
madrassas and carried out, at least in part, by students ‹ there was no 
<br>
government condemnation. Just two weeks ago, the Pakistan president, 
<br>
Pervez Musharraf, was calling them &quot;misunderstood organizations,&quot; that 
<br>
were actually welfare systems to aid the poor. He has since jailed 
<br>
several of the madrassas' leaders, after demonstrations in Quetta and 
<br>
Karachi left businesses ablaze. 
<br>
<p><p>Maulana Khalid Banori, who heads Darul-Uloom Sarhad in Peshawar, sees 
<br>
himself as a college superintendent. Students at his madrassa study 
<br>
science, math and English, and can use credits earned here to apply for 
<br>
graduate schools, or they can use their education to qualify for civil 
<br>
service jobs. He said he wants his students to have a well-rounded 
<br>
education, but one based in the teachings of Islam. 
<br>
<p><p>He hopes the violence will end, that the terrorism will end. It will, he 
<br>
said, as soon the Americans stop committing it.
