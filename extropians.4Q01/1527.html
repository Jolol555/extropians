From: Anders Sandberg 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While I think Natasha's analysis makes a lot of sense, there might also
</em><br>
be an additional cultural cognitive factor: in general people are not
<br>
good at making complex future scenarios.&lt;
<br>
<p>&quot;Multi-tracking&quot; is the most effective method for future scenario designing.  While I skimmed the phrase lightly, thank you for expanding on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You imagine change along one
</em><br>
variable, and see the consequences (&quot;given the increasing population and
<br>
transportation needs, in the future all cities will be choked on horse
<br>
manure&quot;). But to really make a good future model (even for short range
<br>
planning like how to organise one's day) you need to take both several
<br>
variables into account and how changes cause further changes (the
<br>
response to limited resources is economic incentives for finding new
<br>
resources or better ways of using them, making the original shortage
<br>
temporary). Most people seem to be fairly unusued to this on a large
<br>
scale - they do it all the time in everyday thinking but do not apply it
<br>
to thinking about the big picture. I think this is mainly cultural
<br>
thing, there has so far not been any training or even need for it. But
<br>
things are changing, and more and more people seem to be able to run
<br>
scenario planning through their heads quickly and efficiently.&lt;
<br>
<p><p>When people consider future events, there is a tendency to place their bets on one area they think will potentially have the most consequential effect.  But what is a far more productive analysis stems from viewing varied areas of development which affect the future from all sorts of directions.  How rare are the people who have comprehensive information gathered from varied points of view, and what better and enjoyable conversationalists they are.
