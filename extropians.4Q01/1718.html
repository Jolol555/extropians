I was watching some PBS
<br>
<em>&gt; last night, and they were doing a piece on the guy who originally made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the claims about a &quot;God spot&quot; in the brain
</em><br>
<p>Secrets of the Mind
<br>
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/mind/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/mind/</a>
<br>
Dr. Vilayanur Ramachandran, an eloquent neuroscientist, is fascinated by
<br>
patients who have unusual abilities or defects in the way they perceive the
<br>
world. These include such puzzling phenomena as the phantom pain experienced
<br>
in a missing, amputated limb, or the inability to recognize a familiar face
<br>
following a stroke. From these strange cases, Ramachandran is building a novel
<br>
vision of how the brain works. In &quot;Secrets of the Mind,&quot; NOVA dramatizes the
<br>
intimate stories of Ramachandran's encounters with his extraordinary patients.
<br>
Original broadcast date: 10/23/2001
<br>
Topics: medicine/disease &amp; research, human biology/behavior
<br>
<p>Hey Anders! Check this out. It's good stuff.
<br>
<p>The non-introductory portions of this article were excerpted with permission
<br>
from Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind, by V.S.
<br>
Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee (Quill/William Morrow, 1998).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Ramachandran's Notebook
</em><br>
Vilayanur Ramachandran has been called a Sherlock Holmes of neuroscience.
<br>
Director of the Center for Brain and Cognition at the University of
<br>
California, San Diego, and adjunct professor at the Salk Institute for
<br>
Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, Ramachandran has brilliantly
<br>
sleuthed his way through some of the strangest maladies of the human mind. He
<br>
has done this by marrying simple tools such as mirrors and cotton swabs with
<br>
an insatiably inquisitive mind and a tonic sense of humor.
<br>
<p>One of the areas in which he has made some of his greatest strides is in the
<br>
arena of phantom limbs, in which amputees and even those born without one or
<br>
more limbs feel pain and other sensations in their missing body parts. Here,
<br>
read Ramachandran's vivid descriptions of his experiences with phantom-limb
<br>
patients and how he has managed to understand their singular dilemmas and
<br>
thereby help them.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
