<p>I don't believe this is true, although I'm not sure about the exact
<br>
details of this particular experiment.  In the case of separated particles
<br>
with correlated spins, most physicists today would *not* say that the
<br>
particles actually had well-defined spins but that the wave function
<br>
represented our lack of knowledge of those spins prior to observation.
<br>
<p>The reason they don't say this is because you can in principle bring the
<br>
particles back together and show interference effects which would not be
<br>
possible if they had well defined spins.  If physicists had adopted the
<br>
stance you describe, they would be forced to say that once the boxes were
<br>
brought near each other the particles had lost their well-defined spins
<br>
(or positions), which is absurd.
<br>
<p>There is a fundamental difference between these quantum effects and the
<br>
classical phenomenon of two boxes only one of which contains a particle.
<br>
With the quantum case it is clear that there is no well-defined state
<br>
until the measurement is done.  In the classical case this is not true.
<br>
It confuses the issue to suggest that these two situations are similar.
