The biology of 'irrational exuberance'

Research finds body responds to market swings
<br>
By Gareth Cook, Globe Staff, 10/23/2001
<br>
<p>hen Alan Greenspan coined the phrase ''irrational exuberance,'' he was
<br>
cautiously telling America that investors had begun to create a stock-market
<br>
bubble. He was right.
<br>
<p>Now it looks like he might have been onto some serious science as well.
<br>
<p>In a yearlong study at a major Boston financial company, researchers from the
<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University found that
<br>
professional currency traders react to changing markets not just with their
<br>
brains, but also subconsciously - with their whole bodies. As they sit at
<br>
their desks moving millions of dollars through the financial system, their
<br>
vital signs react almost instantaneously as prices dip and rise.
<br>
<p>They are, in other words, wired to the market.
<br>
<p>Like bond traders and stockbrokers, foreign-currency traders are paid to act
<br>
rationally - to ignore the waves of emotion that consume amateur investors.
<br>
Yet all of the currency traders in the new study showed a clear physiological
<br>
response to what the markets did, experiencing powerful surges - jumps in
<br>
blood flow, sweating - with every rally and reverse. A strong emotional
<br>
reaction was clear in regions far from the rational mind.
<br>
<p>The research, conducted by an MIT economics researcher and a neuroscientist at
<br>
BU, adds momentum to a growing revolt against classical economic theories,
<br>
which assume people will always make decisions by thinking and acting
<br>
rationally.
<br>
<p>A growing group of economists has been arguing that financial markets do not
<br>
always behave in a rational way. They go through panicky stock-market selloffs
<br>
or dramatic spikes that cannot be easily explained by reasoned behavior.
<br>
<p>A better model, the new study's authors believe, will develop when economics
<br>
can find a place for the irrational quirks of human nature. And their paper,
<br>
accepted for publication in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, is the
<br>
first such study done outside a laboratory, opening up a new kind of research
<br>
into how people actually make decisions and respond to risk.
<br>
<p>''This is an important paper,'' said Hersh Shefrin, a professor of finance at
<br>
Santa Clara University. ''These are real traders in real-life settings.''
<br>
<p>The researchers wired traders with equipment that measures their heart rate
<br>
and perspiration, and compared the results to a chart of the day's ups and
<br>
downs. They did not, however, match the traders' reactions with the decisions
<br>
they actually made. In other words, the study showed how their bodies reacted,
<br>
but not what their brains told them to do.
<br>
<p>But the researchers did find something surprising: After watching the results,
<br>
they could gauge traders' experience level solely by how their bodies behaved
<br>
as they worked. Novice traders reacted strongly. Experienced ones displayed a
<br>
more even keel.
<br>
<p>''What most surprised us was the ability to distinguish experienced traders
<br>
from less experienced ones,'' said Andrew Lo, co-author of the study and
<br>
director of MIT's Laboratory for Financial Engineering at the MIT Sloan School
<br>
of Management.
<br>
<p>That finding eventually could have some practical uses in the financial world.
<br>
MIT is about to file a patent on the technique, which Lo said he hoped to
<br>
refine so that banks could use it to screen job applicants - and perhaps, if
<br>
scientists discover how the emotions affect decisions, to train and even
<br>
monitor their traders.
<br>
<p>Analysts said the research is not yet practical enough to be of any use to
<br>
financial institutions. How people perceive risk is a vital area, though, for
<br>
companies that invest other people's money, according to Arnold Wood,
<br>
president and chief executive officer of Martingale Asset Management in
<br>
Boston. If there were a better way to assess how much risk investors were
<br>
willing to take on, it would be easier to construct investment portfolios
<br>
tailored to their needs.
<br>
<p>To Lo, however, it's the broader implications that drove him to the work.
<br>
<p>''I was led to this research by force,'' Lo said, ''because the standard
<br>
paradigms we use in economics and finance have not progressed.''
<br>
<p>Classic economics assumes that people are rational and greedy, always making
<br>
choices that will bring them the most expected incomes. From this assumption,
<br>
economists have then been able to build elaborate, mathematically precise
<br>
theories.
<br>
<p>''At one level, the logic of economics is so rigorous, but it is built on a
<br>
foundation of folk psychology that we would mock in other fields,'' said Terry
<br>
Burnham, a visiting assistant professor at the Harvard Business School.
<br>
<p>In the last two decades, a growing body of critics have been cataloguing the
<br>
many ways that the classical view of ''homo economicus'' fails. Economists
<br>
have observed, for instance, that a person will usually feel better off if he
<br>
receives a raise - but can feel worse off if he is given a raise while a
<br>
co-worker receives a larger raise.
<br>
<p>Economists say this research, called behavioral economics or behavioral
<br>
finance, has succeeded in proving that classical economics has flaws, but has
<br>
failed to offer a viable alternative, causing some researchers to look for a
<br>
new foundation, perhaps in biology.
<br>
<p>To investigate the role of emotions in economic activity, Lo teamed up with
<br>
Dmitry Repin, a neuroscientist at Boston University who made the research a
<br>
part of his doctoral thesis. The two then approached what they describe as ''a
<br>
major global financial institution'' - which participated on the condition of
<br>
anonymity - about enlisting traders in currencies and interest-rate
<br>
derivatives in the test.
<br>
<p>Working last year, the team outfitted 10 employees with equipment that
<br>
measures data - such as pulse rate, skin conductance, and respiration rate -
<br>
that researchers know is closely related to emotion. The data only indicate
<br>
when someone is having an emotional response, Repin said, not what emotion
<br>
they are experiencing.
<br>
<p>The traders were then allowed to work as they normally would, and the team
<br>
recorded their responses while tracking ''market events,'' such as a sudden
<br>
bump in price. All of the traders responded emotionally to the market events.
<br>
<p>Lo said that he has been amazed at how strong an emotional link traders form
<br>
with the market - and how clearly experience can change their response. He
<br>
said he was demonstrating the equipment to a class when he saw one student
<br>
exhibit the distinctive pattern of a more experienced trader. It turned out
<br>
the student had traded bonds for several years.
<br>
<p>It was as if her emotional circuitry, he said, had been permanently changed.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual

uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
