Actually, one doesn't need to assume substrate independence - simply

that

our own level of reality is one that can be simulated by our enclosing

characteristics by virtue of our mere simulationness; we just don't know
<br>
what they are, of course, being mere simulations.

<p>Well, yes, you can assume that. However, in doing that you are assuming the
materialist definition of consciousness (ie: it isn't). Yet again, it needs
to be explicitly stated.
<p>It seems as though most people identify with the idea that they are
conscious. So, you must explicitly state the assumption that we can create a
being that perceives its own consciousness, using only stuff.
