<em>&gt; See, this is what I'm talking about. Crossing the fine line between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disbelieving our own gov's propoganda and believing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposition's. Be equally skeptical of assertions that we are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unequivocal good guys and assertions that they AREN'T the bad guys.
</em><br>
<p>I'll try to clarify my point.  There is no need to assign them the charge of
<br>
killing every american to make them the bad guys, and there is no need for them
<br>
to want to kill every american to make them the bad guys.  I do believe they are
<br>
the bad guys (or at least, the worse guys).  I do not believe they want to kill 
<br>
every american.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; i do read the newspapers (every now and then), watch tv news programs and follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world events on the net.  I haven't heard, seen or read in any of those what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seems to be so obvious to you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Google tells me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Your search - Al-Qaida &quot;kill every american&quot;  - did not match any documents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here. Read. You too, Samantha.

Thank you.  I had never read that text before.  Now, the relevant bit seems to 
<br>
be:
<br>
&quot;The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies--civilians and military--is an 
<br>
individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is 
<br>
possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque 
<br>
from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of 
<br>
Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim&quot;
<br>
<p>Admittedly much harsher than i thought previously.  And still, i do not
<br>
think this is a call to kill every American, but to kill them until they get out
<br>
of the middle east all together.  (Now, to try to minimise the interpretations by
<br>
people who seem to read too much into other people's writings, i will state more
<br>
clearly: i am most definitely not supporting Al-Qaida's aim, method or raison
<br>
d'etre, nor would i cry for very long if bin Laden, and people in al-Qaida got 
<br>
killed.  This was originally a response to John Clark's statement that he didn't 
<br>
care why they wanted to kill him, just that they did, which i thought was 
<br>
silly since it might be beneficial to know, and that they wanted every 
<br>
american dead, which i was unaware of, and still dispute)
