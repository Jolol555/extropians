Technology: Israeli scientists create microscopic computer from living cells
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nandotimes.com/technology/story/179332p-1727375c.html">http://www.nandotimes.com/technology/story/179332p-1727375c.html</a>
<br>
<p>JERUSALEM (November 24, 2001 6:49 p.m. EST) - Using a trillion living cells, a
<br>
group of scientists have developed a computing device small enough to fit in a
<br>
drop of water, an Israeli university announced.
<br>
<p>The microscopic computer uses enzymes as hardware, which in turn manipulates
<br>
DNA molecules as software, creating a single mathematical computing machine,
<br>
called a finite automaton.
<br>
<p>The &quot;biological nanocomputer&quot; was created by a group of scientists headed by
<br>
Ehud Shapiro, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science, which
<br>
announced the development.
<br>
<p>&quot;The living cell contains incredible molecular machines that manipulate
<br>
information-encoding molecules ... in ways that are fundamentally very similar
<br>
to computation,&quot; Shapiro said.
<br>
<p>Another expert expressed both caution and optimism.
<br>
<p>&quot;Using the term 'computer' is actually a bit misleading,&quot; said professor
<br>
Naftali Tishbi of the Hebrew University, a scientist familiar with the group's
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>Tishbi defined the cells as automatons, meaning they operate according to
<br>
preset reactions, but he said the invention is &quot;a very exciting step toward
<br>
plausible DNA computing.&quot;
<br>
<p>The creators of the device said that the trillion cells, acting together, can
<br>
perform a billion operations per second, with 99.8 percent accuracy. The
<br>
trillion cells require less than a billionth of a watt of power to operate.
<br>
<p>Although the nanocomputer doesn't have any practical use at the moment,
<br>
scientists claim it has enormous potential. &quot;Such a future computer could
<br>
sense an abnormal biochemical change in the body and decide how to correct it
<br>
by synthesizing and releasing the necessary drug,&quot; said professor Zvi Livneh,
<br>
a DNA expert at the Weizmann Institute.
<br>
<p>Tishbi said the automatons could soon prove to be useful by detecting
<br>
anomalies while operating within human DNA.
