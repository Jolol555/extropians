<p>Certainly don't ignore them.  But it would be good to also not

accept the first proposed action that comes along without due

considerations of its consequences, costs (in all measures),
<br>
whether it is is just response and whether it is likely to have

the desired effects.

<p><em>&gt; &gt;Will they be satisfied when/if 4.5 million Afghanis die of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said there was a vengeance aspect to this, but it is not entirely
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>These people were dependent on foreign aid for food before
<br>
9/11.  What food they were getting has largely been disrupted. 
<br>
We orderd the ending of the truck caravans from Pakistan that
<br>
brought in most of the food by 9/16.  Most of rest is now
<br>
impossible to deliver while the bombardment continues.  In a
<br>
week or two at most (and perhaps already for some areas) it will
<br>
be too late for many.  Is this actually a goal that any of us
<br>
support or desire?  Do we believe that continuing the
<br>
bombardment is worth this consequence.  I don't.  We can't speak
<br>
of the good of the people as justification for our actions at
<br>
this time if our actions are directly threatening the deaths of
<br>
millions of innocent civilians.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, and if we had anti-gravity and teleportation we could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;really accomplish the miraculous!  Seriously, there is no way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by force destroy terrorism and what it grows from.  It is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;dangerous fallacy to belief this can be done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't agree. What makes the current situation unique was not Bin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laden, but Bin Ladens MONEY.That and the fact the Taliban who share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a common vision with him gave him sanctuary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is our intebt to eliminate both of these factors from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That will be utterly insufficient to eliminate terrorism.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Perhaps you have been spoonfed material that supports this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;notion or makes it easy to come too.  But it ignores that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;region has been massively manipulated by the US and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;countries in ways that have been detrimental to the people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;against our own principles in many cases.  It ignores that many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in the area have good reason to be angry at US.  In that way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;respect it is certainly simplistic.  But when I or others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;attempt to bring out those reasons we are considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;anti-patriotic or not behind the &quot;righteous&quot; &quot;war&quot; sufficiently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;leftist and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't agree that they have a case against us, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrelevant. The issue is that we were attacked, and we will always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Then you are not familiar with history.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Do you care if we have acted and are acting like international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bullies and destroying homes/lifes/countries for reasons that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will greatly anger and disgust you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The government has done some questionable things in the past, none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of which justifies the attack against us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I did not say it justifies it.  I said that speaking as if it
<br>
was only lies and fundamentalism that give rise to the anger is
<br>
speaking falsely and simplistically.  There is a big difference.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Do you care whether we live our ideals outside the US as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;inside?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Our ideals&quot; I think your talking 250 million or so different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions of this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't parse that sentence.  We say we stand for certain things
<br>
in the world and I propose that we actually act as if we do and
<br>
that we correct ourselves where we act as if we do not.  If you
<br>
are counting people then their are  over 6 billion reather than
<br>
250 million.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Do you care whether we become an armed camp in order to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;terrorist attacks?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best way to prevent this is to destroy those who've attacked us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and make it clear any further attempts will have the same results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That will be insufficient.  Especially as we have already passed
<br>
significant measures greatly dangerous to our domestic freedom
<br>
and well-being.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Al Jazeera is an Islamic media tabloid. They feed the population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; exactly what they want to hear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I see.  And our media does not uh?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe I was defending our media. Not likely to either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Then why concentrate your contempt only on their media?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Of course not.  You only care, judging from the above, about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;vengeance and proving it will cost a lot to ever poke the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;again.  Doesn't that seem like a tad provincial attitude?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see anything provincial about it, and I do care about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great deal more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I do think destroying those responsible and making it clear we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will do so again is the best policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;How many have risen up in his place?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I said what made this situation unique was Bin Laden's money and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the santuary the Taliban gave him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You do not think that others will also gain money and have
<br>
sanctuary and support?  There is a lot of wealth in the MidEast
<br>
and a lot of anger.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We have learned, at great price, many valuable lessons. I hope we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I don't refuse to consider it.  I simply point out it is not all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the problem or as much of the problem as you seem to want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;make it out to be and that attempting to forcefully end that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;source of the problem&quot; will not work.   Do you belief we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;spread our own falsehoods and half-truths btw?  The idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the lies they tell about us plus religious fanaticism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sufficient to explain their hatred and terrorist actions IS such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;a falsehood and half-truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They can believe whatever they like. I suggest they also pay close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention and &quot;believe&quot; there will be hell to pay for attacking the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Are you ignorning the point that you may be missing something? 
<br>
Or that we are being told ourselves in part lies and
<br>
half-truths?  How will you find out?  Do you care to or are you
<br>
comfortable with the current assumption that the current means,
<br>
horrendous as they may be in consequences of famine in
<br>
Afghanistan, are sufficient and the &quot;right thing&quot;?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So.  Does your enlightenment extend to western media?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't waste my time with mass media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Good.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I see.  Regardless of actual guilt in the one incident you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you are about addressing, you have picked parties to destroy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;order to satisfy vengeance, provide a lasting image of our power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and believe you (plural) have actually addressed and finished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with the issue.  Got it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No you don't. We know who these people are, we know where they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been, we know who their associates are, we know where the money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.  We don't know precisely who did the attack.  We do know who
<br>
bin Laden is and that he is a sworn enemy but that is not the
<br>
same thing as knowing he is guilty of this.   
<br>
<p>Do you know where the CIAs money had come from, btw, for many of
<br>
its black ops over the years?  Largely from drugs.  Follow the
<br>
source and flow of drugs and you will find the hands and
<br>
lifeblood of some of our own cladestine activities.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; They work for Bin Laden.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Really?  Guilt by association is sufficient?  Associates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;involved in one attack on X are suficient to believe all attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on X are the work of bin Laden?  Whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My fault, I made it too simplistic, see above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The Taliban allowed Bin Laden to have his terrorist bases there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; they are in complicity with Al-Quaeda, and will now share their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; fate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Interesting.  What of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, and so on who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;at one time or another thought the Al-Quaeda network was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;reasonable think to partially support?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually bringing these elements to task for their support is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Really, I find this sort of reasoning quite empty even granting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the assumption fundamental assumption.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most civilized law codes agree with me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, no they don't when it comes to international law.  But
<br>
perhaps you would say that isn't civilized.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;They are very well entrenched and have a fair amount of popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;support within Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;area even now.  The civilian populations that are within and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their supporters will die in large numbers if you been by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;destroying the Taliban&quot; destroying all who consider themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Taliban.  If you mean only removing them from power many will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;still die but not as many.  So which do you mean?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They will not be entrenched for long. I am talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan only. For the moment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; We will pursue Al-Qaeda wherever they exist, countries that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; terrorist bases (Sudan) may face military action. But I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the current plan is to use agents in other places.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I see.  So much for yuur early seeming claim we were only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;involved in Afghanistan and then would go home.  Will you then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;go after Hammas and other groups?  Do you think you can end or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;eviscerate so much anger by militarily finding the most actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;angry and killing them and inflicting whatever &quot;collateral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;damage&quot; it takes?  To me this is a very very dangerous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;twisted fallacy that can do nothing but much more seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;inflame the world and endanger all of us (all of humanity not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;just us) and what we hold most dear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think you can placate these groups and they will all go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away? And at what price?
</em><br>
<p>I think if we do not address the causes of what righteous anger
<br>
toward us may be in the region that all the bombs and guns in
<br>
the world will not be enough to keep us safe.  We should bring
<br>
international criminals to justice certainly.  But I don't think
<br>
what we are doing now is a step toward justice.  I think it is a
<br>
step toward further hatred and terror and millions of deaths.  
<br>
<p>I think we should have presented our evidence before world
<br>
courts and the Taliban and then demanded bin Laden be turned
<br>
over.  I think we must stop the bombing now while there is a
<br>
ghost of a chance to save millions of Afghani lives this
<br>
winter.  I think continuing the bombing through the holy month
<br>
of Ramadan would be a seen as extremely callous and will be a
<br>
political and cultural disaster.   And most of all I think we
<br>
would be fools to extend this campaign into other countries in
<br>
the region.
