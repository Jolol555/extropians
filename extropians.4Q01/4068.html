<p>
A scheme to run fibres down sewer pipes could uncork the last-mile bottleneck
<br>
that is holding back online business in Britain
<br>
<p>A company that plans to solve the last-mile problem by wiring the sewers of
<br>
major cities is hoping to install fibre beneath a major UK city soon. &quot;We hope
<br>
to have permission by the end of December,&quot; said Larry Berent, president of
<br>
Citynet International, though he would not say in which city.
<br>
<p>While there is no shortage of international and long distance bandwidth, so
<br>
called &quot;metro&quot; networks are currently the bottleneck for service providers.
<br>
Linking two cities is easy, but most of the cost of any data service is taken
<br>
up by the &quot;tails&quot; which link to the user sites. These are expensive because of
<br>
the cost and disruption of digging up roads and installing fibre in cities.
<br>
<p>CityNet's answer is to use a wheeled robot to pull fibres along existing
<br>
underground pipes -- the sewer network. The process includes a thorough
<br>
clean-up of the pipework, and the fibres are held in place by expanding
<br>
collars which actually strengthen the sewer pipe. In most cases, the company
<br>
hopes to get rights to wire the sewers in exchange for a promise to maintain
<br>
the pipes -- a win-win situation for city councils faced with spiralling
<br>
maintenance bills for ageing sewer pipes.
