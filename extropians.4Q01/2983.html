<em>&gt; &gt;It is &quot;anti-Americanism&quot; to point out that we have acted badly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in many instances and many countries?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is anti-Americanism when you only attack one side and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberately and completely ignore the actions of others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially when their actions were worse, and the context in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such actions were taken.
</em><br>
<p>The other side is quite well represented and, imho, it is
<br>
represented as much whiter and morally clean than it in fact
<br>
is.  I strive to show what is often being ignored.  How does
<br>
that make me &quot;anti-American&quot;?  To be non-anti-American do I need
<br>
to never speak of what we do that is simply wrong?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You went on and on about the American bio-weapons program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blissfully unaware that the American program was terminated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1972. The Soviets after signing the same treaty increased their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facilities a thousand fold. This is not conjecture, but documented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you believe that I believe you are in dreamland.  Treaties on
<br>
bio-weapons we worked for we refuse to sign ourselves citing
<br>
possible industrial espionage if we allow inspections.  We are
<br>
today working on a super-anthrax to &quot;test our defenses&quot;.  I am
<br>
not privy to the inside of the military world but I would be
<br>
very surprised if we had simply packed it all in and done
<br>
nothing at all with bio-war agents in 29 years.  If nothing else
<br>
we would work with them to balance the efforts of other nations.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; There are a number of nations around the world developing bio-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons, we would be justified in having our own program for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I see.  That is the old MAD logic.  But are you really, really
<br>
sure that our program is and will always be only defensive?  Are
<br>
you sure that even if it is intended to be that the world is
<br>
actually safer with it in place.  I'm not.  Does that make me
<br>
&quot;anti-American&quot;?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;It is a matter of public record that we have done so if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;trouble yourself to look.  Or would you rather simply label me and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ignore any facts that might be unsettling to your current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;position?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am well aware that we backed regimes that from a retrospective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were bad for their peoples, I was in the Philipines during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reign of Ferdinand Marcos, and a good friend in high school after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winning a science fair was a guest of the Shah of Iran, but you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely ignore why.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why we have done things like we did in Chile where we practiced
<br>
assasination, industrial sabotage, rabble rousing, economic
<br>
sabotage and so on to the detriment of hundreds of thousands of
<br>
people we were not at war with and who had no intention of going
<br>
communist?  Why did we help the Contras terrorize civilians and
<br>
hospitals far from Nicaraguan troops to better destabilize the
<br>
country at the cost of many thousands of lives?  We could go on
<br>
along time on the legacy that some may thing we had &quot;good
<br>
reason&quot; for.  But, in point of fact, we acted highly illegally
<br>
in most of these instances and in violation of principles we
<br>
hold other nations to.  In short we acted like what we call
<br>
terrorists.  A lot of our victims know this.  If we do not start
<br>
by facing this ourselves then I don't see how our actions and
<br>
policies can be judged as honest and balanced.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We were involved in a cold war with the former Soviets, Democracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs Totalitarianism for the fate of the world. Since we could not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere at the same time we had little choice but to back anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who opposed the Soviets, in most countries they were the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice. You also ignore the fact that we were not alone in this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all those who opposed the Soviets also backed these regimes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ah, I see.  Do you know how many moderate governments, elected
<br>
freely, with no more left-leaning than our own welfare state
<br>
that we also toppled in this supposed war for &quot;democracy&quot;? 
<br>
Enough that I can't really believe that we did what we did only
<br>
for democracy's sake against totalitarianism.  We did operations
<br>
in countries that had nothing at all to do with the Soviets and
<br>
simply wanted to govern their country as they saw fit.  
<br>
<p>I never said that only we did despicable things.  I said we must
<br>
admit and understand what we did and its consequences and
<br>
repurcussions if we are ever going to improve things in this
<br>
world. 
<br>
<p>In the old days we excused everything with the &quot;Cold War&quot;. 
<br>
Today we excuse everything with the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;.  But
<br>
much we have done and will do is not excusable and makes the
<br>
world worse off instead of better and much more dangerous for
<br>
you and I and all of our fondest dreams.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We did not go around the world meddling for lack of better things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.  We went around meddling to (a) contain communism and (b)
<br>
fatten what we perceived as our economic interests.  Any account
<br>
that leaves out (b) is seriously short-sited.  Also (a) is not
<br>
so simple when one starts unraveling all the things swept under
<br>
that rug.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; These things have to be considered in their historical context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Why do I bother?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are trying to solve problems using reason which is commendable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am merely trying to point out the holes in your reasoning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not out to label, nor tar-and-feather you. I find your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions valuable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  I needed to hear that just now.  Thank you for the
<br>
exchange of thoughts.
<br>
