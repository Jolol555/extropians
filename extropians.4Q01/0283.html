<em>&gt; I've heard this view mentioned before.  Does anyone know of any articles in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scientific literature on it?  I'd like to read more about it.
</em><br>
<p>There was a good post several months ago on this list linking to an
<br>
article on the argument. I also recommend Martyn J. Fogg's seminal
<br>
textbook &quot;Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments&quot;, which I
<br>
think should be on the reading list for all Extropians.
<br>
<p>Originally, the Earth had about 50 times the atmosphere it has right
<br>
now, and a crust thicker than that of Venus. About 3.5 billion years
<br>
ago, a planetisimal glanced the earth, remelting its crust while
<br>
launching most of it into orbit around the earth, eventually
<br>
agglomerating into the Moon. Prior to this, the earth had no tectonic
<br>
system. With a thick crust, the earth had a slow percolation system like
<br>
Venus. Only when most of the crust was blasted away into space was a
<br>
plate tectonic system able to develop.
<br>
<p>Similarly, prior to the formation of the moon, the earth had a far
<br>
weaker magnetic system that relied on the thermal convection currents of
<br>
the inner earth to generate asymmetric fields of varying strength around
<br>
the earth. It was only when the tidal drag of the moon on the earths
<br>
rotation occured that the current rotor-stator system of the core/mantle
<br>
system began to generate the preponderance of the magnetic field we have
<br>
today. The fact that the rotational and magnetic north poles both
<br>
precess is evidence of this.
<br>
<p>The planetesimal impact blasted a good portion of the earth's early
<br>
atmosphere into space as well, and enough dust into earth orbit to
<br>
significantly cool the earth enough to allow life to form without
<br>
incineration. With life, the CO2 predominant atmosphere became
<br>
sequestered over time and is now the vast layers of limestone that
<br>
underlie much of the continental plates.
<br>
<p>Life could never form today on Venus, as even the most basic bacteria
<br>
would incinerate many kilometers above the surface. When the sun was
<br>
significantly cooler several billion years ago, this was not the case.
<br>
At the time that Venus was broadly hospitable to life, the earth was in
<br>
its 'Ice House' stage, where life only existed around volcanic vents and
<br>
within the very rock of the earth. As the Sun warmed over time, Venus
<br>
eventually became inhospitable, and any life that may have evolved was
<br>
never able to develop any technology due to its thick lithosphere.
