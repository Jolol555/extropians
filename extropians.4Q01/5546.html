<em>&gt; From: Brain D Williams &lt;<a href="mailto:talon57@well.com?Subject=Re:%20Aid%20for%20Afghanistan&In-Reply-To=&lt;B8566228.884C%25g.rees@fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk&gt;">talon57@well.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nonsense. The Taliban did not even exist when we funded rebel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups in Afghanistan to oppose the Soviet invasion.
</em><br>
<p>The Taliban emerged around 1993, well after the Soviet withdrawal - so you
<br>
are literally correct. But I think it is perhaps a little disingenuous to
<br>
imply that the USA had nothing  to do with the Taliban. The CIA channeled
<br>
large amounts of funding and arms via the ISI to support militant Islamic
<br>
groups in opposing the Soviet invasion. Individuals supported (indirectly)
<br>
by the USA at that time included Usama bin Laden. From the wreckage at the
<br>
end of the Soviet withdrawal emerged the Taliban, utilising weaponry and
<br>
training that had previously been provided by the ISI/CIA.
<br>
<p>The ultimate consequences of this (9/11) is clearly wholly unanticipated,
<br>
and in that sense no 'blame' can be attributed to US foreign policy in the
<br>
late 80s/early 90s. Terrorists, harboured by the Taliban, were responsible
<br>
for 9/11; not the USA.
<br>
<p>However, this unfortunate sequence of events should certainly alert everyone
<br>
to the fact that foreign policy that at the time might seem sensible ('fight
<br>
the Soviet invasion') can have wholly unanticipated (and fatal) consequences
<br>
for US citizens and Afghani civilians caught in the crossfire.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The USA helped create, train &amp; directly funded, elements in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Afghanistan that are at least partly responsible for the terrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; years of war &amp; bloodshed that the country has endured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The U.S. supported groups defending against the Soviet invasion. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was after the Soviets left that they started fighting amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves for control. Something they have always done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This hardly makes us responsible, try sticking to the facts.
</em><br>
<p>I agree there is no direct chain of causality here; the US is not
<br>
'responsible' in that sense. But in its foreign policy, the US shapes
<br>
attitudes and events that have consequences. One of the goals of foreign
<br>
policy (or covert operations?) must surely be to limit as much as possible
<br>
any unintended consequences. So in that sense at least, US foreign policy of
<br>
the late 80s might be said to have failed.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Geraint
