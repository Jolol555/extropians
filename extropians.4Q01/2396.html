<em>&gt;We still have a right to defend ourselves and retailiate, I believe.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;1. Find the person(s) responsible for the Sept 11 atrocity and kill
<br>
him/them.&quot;
<br>
<p>I believe that is the Intent in this instance.  Not to mention retaliation
<br>
for the other terrorist attacks perpetuated against US targets.  The US
<br>
Government is attacking the Taliban, a government organization that
<br>
officially endorses terrorist acts against the United States.  They are not
<br>
attacking the Afghan people, although, unfortunately and disheartingly, some
<br>
are being killed.  The Taliban rose to power on the weapons the US left
<br>
behind in Afghanastan when they were helping the Afghan people fend off an
<br>
outright invasion by a communist superpower (russia).  A superpower which
<br>
was intent on expansionism, should the US have remained uninvolved until the
<br>
rest of the world was communist and we stould absolutely no chance in hell
<br>
of defending ourselves?  Does not seem a wise decision.  What was unwise was
<br>
leaving the Afghan people to fend for themselves after they fought off the
<br>
Soviet troops, this was when the Taliban acquired its political hold.  The
<br>
US should have provided assistance, much as it did in Germany and Japan
<br>
after World War II and help to set up a stable capitalist non despotic
<br>
government.  
<br>
<p>&quot;2. Give up on breaking terrorists. There are too many and they hate
<br>
Americans.
<br>
Eventually they'll die. Maybe they might kill each other.&quot;
<br>
<p>An interesting Position, the most effective participator in non-zerosum
<br>
games was tit-for-tat with a random cooperate.  That is, in any conflict, a
<br>
direct system of reciprocity out paced every other strategy for competing,
<br>
with the exception of tit-for-tat with cooperate, which would insert a
<br>
random bit of cooperation into a battle, preventing two competing
<br>
tit-for-tats from spiraling into a continual cycle of reciprocity (you
<br>
attack, we attack back, you attack back, etc. etc.)  I dont think this is
<br>
the time to excersize that restrain, instead we should form a global
<br>
coalition to fight terrorism, reap a mortal blow to it, then excersize
<br>
severe restrain to military intervention in the future, acknowledging the
<br>
correlation to forieng policy and terrorist attacks.
<br>
<p>&quot;3. Stop meddling in other countries' governments. (Maybe then, fewer
<br>
terrorists will hate Americans, and maybe fewer foreigners will be
<br>
annoyed at Americans).&quot;
<br>
<p>I agree here, for the most part.  Insisting on meddling in NO countries
<br>
affairs EVER would be suicidal, and just as illogical as insisting on
<br>
meddling in ALL countries affairs ALL the time.  As in WWII and fighting the
<br>
general communist expansion during the cold war.  I do think that about 90%
<br>
of our interventions in central and south america should have never been
<br>
performed.  Foriegn military intervention should be limited to fighting
<br>
invasions by strong military powers from expansionist countries.
<br>
<p>&quot;4. Let people in other countries find what's appropriate for their own
<br>
culture, make their own mistakes, and so on. If they ask for your help,
<br>
then give it to them, if you can, and preferably, not with the help of
<br>
the government.&quot;
<br>
<p>I agree, to an extent.  But there are certain moral absoluteles that should
<br>
be applied.  Not all cultures are equally valid.  Should it be ok for
<br>
certain tribes to mutilate the vaginas of women because its 'thier culture'?
<br>
What about ritual sacrifice?  What about !Kung Sun who are not considered
<br>
'Men' until the bring home the skull of an enemy?  Are all cultural concepts
<br>
equally valid?  Most ethicians and reasonable people would disagree with
<br>
that assertation, drawing the line at cultural behaviors that inflict
<br>
unwanted pain on people.
<br>
<p>There can be no denying that US foreign Policies influence terrorist
<br>
attacks, or incite that animosity which leads to terrorist attacks.  Fully
<br>
one third of all the terrorist attacks in the world are perpetuated against
<br>
US targets.  The US has no internal civil war and no conflicts with
<br>
neighboring countries, the things usually present in countries wrought with
<br>
terrorism. America is attacked because of what it does, not what it is.  To
<br>
be fair, some terrorist attacks are because of what America is, and not what
<br>
it does, but these are few and far between, and we certainly are not willing
<br>
to revert to poor communist farmers in order to avoid sparse terrorist
<br>
attacks.  But US foreign policy certainly needs to be re-examined in the
<br>
future.  Conversely, some foreign intervention is necessary seeing as we
<br>
live on the same planet, and a country with enough military might to
<br>
threaten us practicing expansionist policies is not something that is good
<br>
to sit idly by and watch.
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
<p>Michael
