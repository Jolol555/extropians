<p>Atheists Tune in 'God Bless America'
<br>
<p>By George H. Smith
<br>
George H. Smith is the author of three books on atheism, including
<br>
&quot;Atheism: The Case Against God.&quot;
<br>
<p>October 30, 2001
<br>
<p>A TRAGEDY of the dimensions of Sept. 11 can bring a search for scapegoats in
<br>
its wake.
<br>
<p>On the political left we find some who blame the supposed evils of &quot;global
<br>
capitalism,&quot; while on the political right we find some who blame the
<br>
godlessness of American society.
<br>
<p>Although the particulars differ, both camps suggest that the victims were
<br>
complicit, whether directly or indirectly, in their own destruction. And
<br>
thus is any concept of authentic innocence swept aside.
<br>
<p>The Cold War is a thing of the past, so the religious right can no longer
<br>
target godless communism as the source of our woes. The terrorists
<br>
responsible for the Sept. 11 massacre were not atheists at all but religious
<br>
fundamentalists of the most extreme type, so the blame is placed on domestic
<br>
rather than on foreign godlessness.
<br>
<p>If it is true that Americans put their differences aside in a time of crisis
<br>
and rally around their common values, this might help to explain the recent
<br>
proliferation of &quot;God Bless America&quot; signs and banners throughout America.
<br>
It might be supposed that Americans are returning to those religious values
<br>
on which this nation was founded.
<br>
<p>There are several problems with this interpretation, however, not the least
<br>
of which is that America was specifically established as a secular nation,
<br>
not a religious one. There is no mention of &quot;God&quot; in the Constitution. And
<br>
when Thomas Jefferson mentioned God in the Declaration of Independence, he
<br>
was referring to the God of deism - that rationalistic creator, popular
<br>
during the 18th-century Enlightenment, who did not communicate with human
<br>
beings or otherwise intervene in human affairs.
<br>
<p>Many of America's most influential founding fathers - such as Jefferson,
<br>
James Madison, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine - were deists highly
<br>
critical of Christianity and other revealed religions. Paine (whose pamphlet
<br>
&quot;Common Sense&quot; was the sparkplug of the American Revolution) claimed that
<br>
&quot;the most detestable wickedness, and the most horrid cruelties, and the
<br>
greatest miseries that have afflicted the human race have had their origin
<br>
in this thing called revelation, or revealed religion.&quot; And Jefferson
<br>
followed suit with his observation that the God of the Old Testament &quot;is a
<br>
being of terrific character - cruel, vindictive, capricious, and unjust.&quot;
<br>
<p>Paine, Jefferson and other deists lamented the intolerance and persecution
<br>
that were common features in the history of Christianity, Islam and other
<br>
revealed religions. In their view, people who believe they have an
<br>
infallible lock on divine revelation will often feel justified in using
<br>
violence and terror against dissenters and unbelievers. Reason, not faith,
<br>
is the philosophical foundation of a free and tolerant society.
<br>
<p>Atheists are a distinct minority in our society, so we might wonder how
<br>
American atheists react to the &quot;God Bless America&quot; signs, posters and
<br>
banners that seem to have popped up everywhere. Do atheists feel excluded by
<br>
this outpouring of religious sentiment? Do they feel they are being told
<br>
that only those who believe in God can be good Americans?
<br>
<p>I recently posed this latter question to a large group of atheists on the
<br>
Internet, and their responses were nearly unanimous. Virtually no atheist
<br>
felt in the least troubled or excluded by the public enthusiasm for &quot;God
<br>
Bless America&quot; - so long, that is, as such expressions were by private
<br>
citizens and not sponsored by government.
<br>
<p>Although this reaction may surprise some people, it is identical to my own.
<br>
For many people, &quot;God Bless America&quot; is not so much about religion per se;
<br>
rather, it expresses a deep, heartfelt sentiment for American ideals and
<br>
values, which were gravely threatened on Sept. 11.
<br>
<p>Just as beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, so meaning lies in the
<br>
intent of the speaker. And in most cases the sentimental intent of &quot;God
<br>
Bless America&quot; is something with which I and most every other American
<br>
atheist can heartily agree.
<br>
<p>It so happens that &quot;God Bless America&quot; is the title of a beautiful and
<br>
inspirational song by Irving Berlin, and this undoubtedly helps to explain
<br>
why this expression tugs at the heartstrings of so many Americans. The song
<br>
and its title have become part of American culture.  Only the most jaded
<br>
atheist could fail to appreciate what these have come to symbolize - namely,
<br>
a tribute to this land and the best in those who inhabit it.
<br>
<p>Some religious believers may take great pleasure in the exclusionary
<br>
implications of &quot;God Bless America,&quot; as if atheists are somehow less than
<br>
legitimate members of American society. But for me tolerance and
<br>
understanding are part of being an atheist, so I refuse to judge a belief on
<br>
the basis of its worst representatives.
<br>
<p>I will therefore continue to judge the recent popularity of &quot;God Bless
<br>
America&quot; in the most benevolent light possible. I will take it for what I
<br>
believe most Americans intend it to be: a tribute to the ideals of freedom
<br>
and tolerance on which America was founded.
