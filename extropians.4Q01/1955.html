I don't quite think some people quite understood the point of this post...
<br>
<p>...I didn't say that Samantha was arguing well, or that she was being
<br>
rational, or that she was being polite.  I said that I didn't think it was
<br>
necessary to go easy on her because no matter what I said or did, or any
<br>
of you say or do, I don't expect it to shatter her psyche.  That's a real
<br>
compliment, but it doesn't mean I think she's perfect, or even good - it
<br>
means what it says, and nothing more.
<br>
<p>It so happens that a lot of people who'd I'd thought had better-structured
<br>
reactions have descended to screaming at each other.  This disturbs me. 
<br>
But worrying about people's feelings being hurt is the wrong reason to
<br>
stop; we should rather stop because this is utterly pointless and
<br>
generates no useful results or information.  People's feelings do get hurt
<br>
in the course of useful arguments; this is a useless one, and it is
<br>
useless because personal feelings have stopped being collateral damage and
<br>
started being the main target.
