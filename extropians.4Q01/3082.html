<em>&gt; I don't think that many of those hostile to America, in the world, really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehend the level of determination, that American's feel in eliminating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those that attacked us. Their apparent hope, that the US will shrug-off 4000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead is fictional.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I do not feel that determination.  I feel very great
<br>
determination to do what I can to eliminate violence itself as
<br>
the most often used means to settle differences and to expose
<br>
and eliminate what real injustices that I can.  Simply
<br>
eliminating those who attacked us only touches the surface of
<br>
the real problem.  It is a cosmetic bandaid.  More hatred and
<br>
violence will not solve the problems the violence of 911
<br>
blossomed out of and fed upon.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  My contention is that many of the Middle Eastern societies were &quot;messed-up&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the US was ever heard of, and they are messed up now. I believe they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have pissed-off the wrong people. I feel no nationalist rage here, only an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness that many Middle Easterners values are what is behind their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misery, poverty, inequalities, and injustices; but they use America as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scape-goat.
</em><br>
<p>How convenient.  So you don't have to care if we mess them up a
<br>
lot worse perhaps?  Or if some 4 million of them die this winter
<br>
because we will not open up the bridges and passes for the aid
<br>
to get to the people before the smows make aid impossible? 
<br>
After all, they were already miserable.  What is it if a few
<br>
million more of them die than would have anyway as long as we
<br>
are satisfied?    
<br>
<p>I have great trouble seeing this as reasonable.
