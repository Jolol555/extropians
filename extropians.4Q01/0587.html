Hi all,
<br>
<p>I've got a technical question, so I hope there are some technically minded
<br>
people out there (erm...). Warning to non-IT types... you will likely find
<br>
this entire post entirely pointless, so switch off now!
<br>
<p>I'm doing YADA work at the moment (Yet Another Database App), and I've run
<br>
into an old problem for which there never seems to be a really good
<br>
solution. This particular app is targetted at RDBMS Brand X (actually it's
<br>
Sybase), and now there is a need to retarget it to another RDBMS. I am
<br>
positive that more databases will creep into the story over time, so this is
<br>
the old database-independent-app problem.
<br>
<p>The big drama with retargetting the app is the mighty mountain of SQL which
<br>
is database specific. RDBMSs are supposed to follow standards with their SQL
<br>
- yeah, right. While they do look superficially similar, SQL dialects differ
<br>
in fundamental join syntax, in built in functions, in the kinds of primitive
<br>
data types they provide operators for, etc. This can be a really big hassle,
<br>
and from an ongoing maintenance point of view it is big enough to be a
<br>
project killer, especially if it forces a codebase to be forked into one
<br>
copy for each database to be targetted.
<br>
<p>In the past I've worked on systems using various approaches to solving this
<br>
problem, from parallel code bases for each database (yes, really!
<br>
urrgghh....), through database tables full of alternate forms of queries for
<br>
each desired database (still nasty to maintain), even apps which try to
<br>
stick to a common simple subset of SQL which works across all dbs (a noble
<br>
but doomed approach). The nicest approach I've used so far was a system I
<br>
built for translating the SQL from one database's dialect to another at run
<br>
time, so that I could stick to one brand of SQL with impunity (within some
<br>
restrictions).
<br>
<p>I'm really truly sick of this stupid problem popping up all the time, and I
<br>
think it's time to nail it. I've got some ideas for the Grand Solution to
<br>
proprietary database evilness, and I'm ready to go and build these solutions
<br>
myself. However, before I go off half cocked, I was hoping others could
<br>
share their experiences with this common problem, solutions they've
<br>
used/know of. I don't want to reinvent the wheel, but the best that google
<br>
has been able to tell me is that yes, this really is a problem without a
<br>
decent solution, and for which one may buy all manner of half baked partial
<br>
fixes. If people can help me get a decent feel for what is available to
<br>
address this problem, I can move forward in some sensible manner.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Emlyn
