&quot;General there are reports coming from Iran saying that ground troops have
<br>
been moved to Afghanistan. Can you tell us if you have some information about
<br>
it? And also, how important do you think artificial intelligence is in the war
<br>
and how is it going to help to modernize and transform the US military in the
<br>
future?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, in terms of troops, I'll just go back to what I've continued to say, we
<br>
are prepared to use the full spectrum of our military capabilities. Obviously
<br>
that -- it's not just bombers or carrier-based aircraft. We use special
<br>
forces. That's one piece. The other piece is that in terms of the ongoing
<br>
operation, I'm not going to comment specifically on what we're doing, because
<br>
if it has the potential to bring harm to our forces that are engaged, I'm just
<br>
not going to do that. On the second part, I think obviously artificial
<br>
intelligence in it will be important as we transform... I mean that's pretty
<br>
obvious.&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
