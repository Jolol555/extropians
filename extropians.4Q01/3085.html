From: &quot;Jacques Du Pasquier&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jacques@dtext.com?Subject=Re:%20Selection%20by%20Migration&In-Reply-To=&lt;000501c17422$ad7dd6e0$295d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">jacques@dtext.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; isn't it likely that there be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important genetic and cultural self-selection ? Those who stay tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more traditional and conservative, content with what they have, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not willing to take risks. Those who go tend to be more adventurous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more confident in themselves, more eager to discover new things
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily, because often &quot;those who go&quot; don't have any choice. For
<br>
example, English who colonized Australia were convicts expelled from England.
<br>
Also, many who came to America were &quot;losers&quot; who could not cope with the
<br>
situation in Europe, or (as another example, the Irish) emigrated because of
<br>
disaster in their homeland. So, it could be that the best and the brightest
<br>
are the ones with the least reason to emigrate. Christopher Columbus was brave
<br>
to cross uncharted seas, but was he more confident in himself than Galileo who
<br>
never left home?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it not imaginable that, by successive such migrations, an evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by self-selection happens (both genetic and cultural), such that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can basically calculate the &quot;adventurous index&quot; based on the distance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from central Africa ?
</em><br>
<p>What about the Africans who travelled great distances from central Africa as
<br>
slaves?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Couldn't some kind of over-traditionnalism brought by this evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account for some of Africa and ME difficulties ?
</em><br>
<p>I see where you're going with this, but you've failed to reckon with the
<br>
negative aspects of migration, such that selection pressure may operate to
<br>
drive out the unfit (or less fit) members of a population, leaving the best
<br>
back home where they have secured good reproductive options for themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Couldn't there be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind of automatic hatred for the successful and not traditional,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some negative thinking, and avoidance of responsability (think of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;altruism claim&quot;) explainable by such genetic-cultural differentiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through absence of migration ?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and it works both ways: Those who hate the successful and non-traditional
<br>
may be the very ones to travel to distant lands to set up communes to practice
<br>
primitivism. As P. J. O'Rourke has said, &quot;America was founded by religious
<br>
fanatics with guns.&quot; The Pilgrims were not avante garde intellectuals, after
<br>
all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can't you actually correlate riches to the &quot;adventurous&quot; index : the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farther you go from central Africa, the more riches you find ?
</em><br>
<p>Quite the opposite: The poorest are driven to the &quot;adventurous&quot; task of
<br>
desperately seeking sustenance by traveling to distant lands. Of course this
<br>
&quot;adventure&quot; may itself constitute a selection process whereby the fittest of
<br>
the travelers are the ones who survive and reproduce, as in the Westward
<br>
migration accompanying the slogan &quot;Go West, young man.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Obviously Extropianism would appear as a new sort of migration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (actually translating into geographical migration if you consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space) bringing a new such self-selection (whatever the further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes Extropians actually perform on themselves).
</em><br>
<p>Extropianism can indeed represent a migration to more highly evolved systems
<br>
of organization. However, this need not be connected to geographic or spatial
<br>
migration as much as it is connected to migration toward more complex adaptive
<br>
ecology within the space already occupied.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
