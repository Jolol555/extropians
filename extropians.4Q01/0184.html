<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;It would if they had actually been cowardly.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;they obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;weren't, and saying they were just makes us look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;like kooks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Murdering innocent civilians is a definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cowardly (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; criminal) in any soldiers book, and should be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyones book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Several factors define cowardice or bravery.  As Brian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notes above, killing the defenseless and &quot;innocent&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen as cowardly. Putting one's own life at risk, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other hand, or knowingly and deliberately facing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain death while maintaining your resolve and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; composure, is seen as courageous.  So the recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks can be characterised either way, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotionally convenient for the various parties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved.
</em><br>
<p>Once again: putting one's life at risk when killing the defenseless is
<br>
not courageous one bit, it is simply rigging things to avoid culpability
<br>
for the crime: doubly cowardly. If your victims are defenseless, then
<br>
you endure no risk from them, the risk is solely that which you create
<br>
for yourself in how you stage the atrocity. Thus, it is an act of
<br>
fearlessness, not courageousness. Courage is defined as facing fear with
<br>
determination. The only risk which can therefore be said to be
<br>
courageously faced is that which the person has absolutely no control
<br>
over.
<br>
<p>This defines the difference between a suicide bomber of civilians and an
<br>
infantryman who charges a machine gun nest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also interesting is how the ultra-rationality required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the conduct of war often conflicts with, and always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subordinates the &quot;value&quot; considerations of cowardice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or bravery.  Destroying the enemy as efficiently and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheaply and safely as possible is pretty much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hallmark of military professionalism.  Attacking from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambush, from safety, from out of range, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overmatched force (the more the better); using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; element of surprise, the cover of darkness, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemy's unpreparedness, confusion, ignorance, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weaknesses of any sort, including any value-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rigidity about what constitutes the &quot;proper or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical&quot; conduct of war--this is the military gold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, fighting dirty or &quot;cowardly&quot; is consummate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldiering, and fighting fair is either insanity or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminal incompetence.  
</em><br>
<p>Uh, no. You are still conflating the killing of civilians with the
<br>
killing of combatants, and you misunderstand the difference between
<br>
strategic and tactical suprise.
