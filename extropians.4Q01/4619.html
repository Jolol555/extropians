<em>&gt; Cool, good lateral thinking KPJ!  Actually I think we already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a number of Muslims in US uniform.  I heard in WW2,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would ask every soldier his faith.  The only choices were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Catholic, Protestant or Jewish.  If one said atheist he was told:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Son there aint no atheists in foxholes, now pick one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dont know if that story is true, but I did hear they now have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other categories, presumably Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyone know?  Mike, did they ask?
</em><br>
<p>You can fill it out, but it's not required. This is something to think
<br>
about though. Lets say that there is established a Church of Extropy, or
<br>
Church of Cryology, where the last rites ceremony involves
<br>
cryopreservation. If this were to become an official religion, which an
<br>
enlistee could check off on the form, so it will wind up on his dogtags,
<br>
then the military would be required to pay for your cryopreservation
<br>
upon your death (and you can name Alcor as the beneficiary of your
<br>
$40,000 life insurance policy that you can get set up too).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding the notion of ridding the Muslim holy land of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infidels, however, I would urge those who desire such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing to immediately build a high wall around the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; region they consider sacred, like the Vatican and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Chinese Forbidden City.  Then if any infidel owns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property in that area, she would need to be bought out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at fair market value.  Part of the reason the US has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops in Saudi is to protect American property there.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a lot of it, legitimately purchased.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, infidels cannot own land there. All land is either owned by a
<br>
local partner or leased.
