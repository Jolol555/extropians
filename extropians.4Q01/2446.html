<p><em>&gt;The Americans are so young and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inexperienced&quot; stuff. There are very few governments as old as ours. 
</em><br>
<p>In this part of the world there may be different governments, but
<br>
there's mostly the same people deeply rooted to their soils for (at
<br>
least) many hundreds of years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Our people know something of that. We had our Civil War those of us in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the South have heard the stories. Even since that time we have had our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indian wars.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;our people&quot; who?
<br>
<p>The pools of blood are very recent under the European's feet. You don't
<br>
think that they understand what it feels like to have thousands of
<br>
people murdered? Of course they understand, much better than your
<br>
patronizing tones indicate. They don't want _more_ blood. They have a
<br>
fair amount of experience that the U.S. approach will fail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is not an event that happened to distant stranger miles from us. 
</em><br>
<p>Europeans had relatives and friends and business associates die
<br>
on September 11.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Amara, I don't expect you would know this in Germany 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- but almost all of us at least knows someone that knew someone that died. 
</em><br>
<p>???  I was born and I lived in the U.S. for 37 years. Please give me
<br>
some credit for having close friends, coworkers, and a family in the
<br>
U.S., and my life permanently changed by those atrocties. I would
<br>
sincerely like them to be safe from the stupidities of the current
<br>
actions of the U.S. government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But you are right about the seriousness of what could come out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this. This could get out of hand and become WWIII. But there is one thing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for sure. They 
</em><br>
<p>Who?
<br>
<em>&gt;have elected us king of the hill 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;us&quot;? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;At least let us conduct ourselves so as to be as economical as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible of innocent American, European and Middle Eastern lives.
</em><br>
<p>At least conduct yourself to be a human being who would like to share
<br>
this planet with other human beings)
<br>
<p>(or is vengence much more important to you?)
