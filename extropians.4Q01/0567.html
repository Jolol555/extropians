<p><em>&gt;I disagree. Distinguishing between dangerous and safe objects is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impossible in general, and I know of no mechanism in the immune
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system that makes such a choice. Rather, the T-cells get &quot;trained&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the thymus to not signal against surfaces found in the body,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but to search for other surfaces. It seems that we have low
</em><br>
<em>&gt;numbers of antibodies against nearly every possible epitope,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;including antigen surfaces we have so far not encountered. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we exhibit immune system reaction even to manmade chemicals
<br>
which do not naturally exist in nature.
<br>
<p>But there are numerous organisms which do live in out bodies
<br>
without provoking immune system reactions, many have evolved &quot;non-
<br>
threatening&quot; chemical coatings. Without trying to carry the
<br>
metaphor too far I was simply saying that our bodies don't reject
<br>
all foreign objects and of course neither should our society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Mites and gut bacteria are normally not in contact with the immune
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I thought the skin itself had some immune functions, guess
<br>
it's back to the books.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Does freedom of information mean freedom of instantaneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;An interesting question. I think I would come down on the yes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;side. I can imagine the use of embargoing information for a while,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but who gets to decide on for how long? If that decision is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible to appeal, then it becomes possible for in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information-embargoing groups to control information just as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were doing actual censorship, simply by putting an extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;long embargo on the information. Once you start circumscribing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom of information - even in the best interest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many people - you allow further, just as reasonable, decreases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freedom of information. Banning certain media can limit the flow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of information tremendously, and if new media are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;automatically given freedom then the effective freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information might decrease - in many countries you may have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right to write what you want on paper or in letters, but if it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any point becomes digital it is suddenly not free. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I think we have to draw a distinction between freedom of
<br>
information and mass media. Mass media outlets in this country are
<br>
rarely even remotely fair, prefering to bias a story to their own
<br>
views. This is the problem associated with out attempts and the
<br>
networks out of Quatar.
<br>
<p>I oppose giving the media access during specific phases of military
<br>
operations as an example.
