<em>&gt; Obviously Extropianism would appear as a new sort of migration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (actually translating into geographical migration if you consider
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Yes, but Extropians were not the first to advocate migration to other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watering holes. The real predecessors were science fiction fans who would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have loved to move to better places to live, in the solar system and beyond. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Staying home reading books and letting someone entertain you with his
<br>
dreams about the future doesn't obviously reflect the &quot;disposition to
<br>
embark in the unknown with hope to make your situation better&quot; I was
<br>
thinking of.
<br>
<p>As I was saying to Damien in private, for some reason, I could never
<br>
read a SF book. I tried a cyberpunk classic (if I understand well)
<br>
some months ago (Gibson, Neuromancer), but it fell from my hands.
<br>
<p>However, I don't think this is because I'm such a risk-taker etc., but
<br>
rather because I like both science and literature, but not the mixing
<br>
of the two.
<br>
<p>I know this is a marginal point of view here, so spare your flames, I
<br>
know how SF can help you to think etc. etc. ;-)
