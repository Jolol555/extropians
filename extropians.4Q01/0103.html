Samantha Atkins a écrit (2.10.2001/02:12) :
<br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, we our freedom, wealth, time and even lives on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line does it really matter all that much whether we consider a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kamikaze terrorist to be cowardly or not?  I certainly don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in wasting one more line of text on the subject.  As alwasy, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humble opinion.
</em><br>
<p>You spoke eloquently in another post of the diverse human cultures,
<br>
how precious they are and how much we will benefit from them (and I do
<br>
hope and want to live such a future).
<br>
<p>But here (and in the other thread about justice, islam etc.) I felt
<br>
you show little interest in understanding the people who made 9/11,
<br>
and the cultural aspect of it. More than that : you explicitly reject
<br>
such interest (&quot;I certainly don't see any point in wasting one more
<br>
line of text...&quot;).
<br>
<p>Well, here is a first point : how can you predict them without
<br>
understanding them ?
<br>
<p>We heard &quot;cowardice&quot; (I was surprised, too), and we heard &quot;madness&quot;,
<br>
and we heard &quot;evil&quot;.
<br>
<p>In my view, all three are false.
<br>
<p>What is true is that they caused a DAMAGE to us (so it is &quot;not good
<br>
for us&quot;, that's for sure), and we don't want to let them cause such
<br>
damage again.
<br>
<p>But it's a matter of OUR INTEREST, not of them being &quot;evil&quot;. In their
<br>
world, in fact, they are like David with Goliath. They are unarmed,
<br>
dominated, victim of injustice, ruled by the evil miscreant US-Israeli
<br>
forces, but they are proud, brave, pious, and they act heroically.
<br>
(they already defeated the Soviets !)
<br>
<p>You would call evil someone pervert who hurts for the sake of hurting,
<br>
for example, just because they enjoy to cause suffering. This is just
<br>
not the situation.
<br>
<p>Why is this important ? For two reasons :
<br>
<p>1) First, as I said, to predict them. But not only to predict them in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sense of designy security tricks in the airplanes. Also, to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;predict how such violent movements will be generated from existing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;socio-cultural conditions. That's why I was trying to tell you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about islam in the other thread -- maybe living in a place where we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have 10 % muslims discourages me taking the &quot;black-bok&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;mad-evil&quot;, &quot;coward-or-brave-what-do-we-care&quot; approach on the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violent islamists -- but you answered by general &quot;argument&quot; to make
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any mention of islam irrelevant.
<br>
<p>2) SEcond, because if one's principles are in such a mess that one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must discard reality to be able to act without strong moral
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dissonance, then proper action will be very difficult at some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point. One should get a clear picture of things, what is an ennemy,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and interest, good, evil, damage, justice, these sort of things. So
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is not really about ben Laden. It is about extropian clarity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of mind, principles usable in making choices, not carried like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baggage.
<br>
<p>Ben Laden is not mad, not evil, not coward (I don't know him
<br>
personnally, but at least it doesn't appear to be). But he is an
<br>
ENNEMY (read his &quot;Declaration of war against the Americans&quot; in case
<br>
you have any doubt). Do you need to morally diminish your ennemy to
<br>
acknowledge him as such ? Of course not !
<br>
<p>You may object that this way of thinking tends to polarize the
<br>
situation, by accepting that &quot;good&quot; guys can be our ennemies, and be a
<br>
fullfilling prophecy avoiding that we build a harmonious world
<br>
together, with all the good guys, by explaining them that they are
<br>
wrong to act as they do, and that by just adapting a little their
<br>
behaviour, we can consider them as really good guy and not &quot;very
<br>
evil-mad&quot; good guy. But that which you may overlook, is that they
<br>
don't give a damn of your &quot;harmony&quot; and your &quot;sense of justice&quot;, which
<br>
is just degenerated christian-atheist nonsense. For them, justice is
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
