&lt;&lt;Does it occur to you that &quot;pulling the rug from under&quot; anyone's
<br>
financed universities that teach anything you do not approve us
<br>
is not any of your business?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>No
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Would it not be better to show
<br>
ever more clearly that the US has the best and most workable
<br>
system as widely as possible and thus undercut any
<br>
&quot;anti-American propaganda&quot;?  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I ain't peddling anything to the Muslims. not democracy, not soap-suds, not 
<br>
why its smarter to keep their women unvielded.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Generally, anyone who wants to
<br>
finance their own establishments, especially in foreight
<br>
countries, can teach whatever they want - right, wrong or
<br>
indifferent.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>No, they murdered thousands of Americans, and they have messed with the wrong 
<br>
people. Let them reap the whirl wind. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Conservation is probably not a viable answer but I certainly
<br>
agree that we need to stop depending on oil for primary energy
<br>
as quickly as possible.  
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; I hope we can do it on a much more positive spin than fear of
<br>
more thousands of Americans dead though.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Americans are foolish to have supported such a hostile, bunch of trolls, like 
<br>
the Wahabbis. They could have helped out your Palistinian buddies, for 
<br>
example, with their oil billions, and trillions, 53 years ago; but refuse. 
<br>
They do this largely because of Wahabbi greed, but the Middle Eastern concept 
<br>
of Muslim &quot;pride&quot;, and how &quot;shameful&quot; it was/is to lose a holy struggle 
<br>
against Kaffirs (non-Muslims). It is also a &quot;pressure&quot; to win all the land 
<br>
&quot;back&quot; and atone for their losing warsin the first place. You see, I am quite 
<br>
convinced that the Middle East is messed-up, in the regard. It sucks.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Understanding, not condoning, is required if you actually want
<br>
to skillfully change a situation.  Not understanding is truly
<br>
non-extropian if we need to cast labels about.  I do not care so
<br>
much for others opinions as for doing that which I believe is
<br>
required to improve the situation.
<br>
<p>- samantha&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>But you have just advocated in your post, that it is not &quot;my business&quot; to 
<br>
change the situation. I believe I do understand what happens over there, and 
<br>
how much image and pride are what plays to the Muslim street. Secondly, what 
<br>
you seem to have suggested, in the past 2 months, serves the political 
<br>
interests of Osama Bin Landin, the Islamists, Saddam and the Wahabbis. 
<br>
Because of this, it is no suprise that that the most informed Americans are 
<br>
often the angriest on this issue, Jon Clark included. 
<br>
<p>And yes, it will encourage the encapsulation and isolation of Extropians to a 
<br>
&quot;kook level&quot;, were your views to be adopted.
