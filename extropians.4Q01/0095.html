<em>&gt; Bayer offers post Antrhax attack treatment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayer Corporation's Cipro® (ciprofloxacin) is the only antibiotic (tablet, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oral suspension and IV) indicated for inhalational anthrax (post exposure) to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure. According 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Cipro's prescribing information, the recommended adult dosing for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment of anthrax exposure is 500mg of oral Cipro Tablet or Suspension 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every 12 hours for 60 days. Treatment should begin as soon as possible after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exposure and before symptoms appear. (WirePix/Bayer Corporation)

<p>I saw this article on Anthrax research today:
<br>
<a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20011001/sc/health_anthrax_dc_1.html">http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20011001/sc/health_anthrax_dc_1.html</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amid heightened concern over a biological
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapon attack involving anthrax, scientists said on Monday they had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made important headway in understanding the molecular events triggered
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the bacterium's lethal toxin and developing an antidote for it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing in the journal Current Biology, researchers at Harvard Medical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School identified a gene found in mice that in some forms made mice
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resistant to anthrax. These gene variations -- which the researchers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speculate also exist in people -- seemed to work by augmenting the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response of the body's immune cells to the toxin released by the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bacterium.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately the research sounds like it is in a relatively early
<br>
stage and it will likely be years before it can be translated into an
<br>
effective therapy.  The article sounds some very sobering notes:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthrax -- a deadly bacterial disease spread by spores and generally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confined to sheep, cattle, horses, goats and pigs -- is seen as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a likely agent in any biological warfare attack because it can be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deployed relatively easily and kills about 90 percent of the people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it infects.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthrax is virtually untreatable once symptoms develop. Initial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flu-like symptoms develop two to three days after the bacteria is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inhaled. This is followed by high fever, vomiting, joint ache, labored
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;breathing, internal and external bleeding, lesions and usually death.
<br>
<p>The problem seems to be that while there are treatments, they will not
<br>
be effective once you find yourself sick.  With a 90 percent fatality
<br>
rate and an extremely painful death this would be a horrifying agent to
<br>
use against the general population.
