&lt;Amara, with respect, I think you're falling prey to what I used to call
<br>
&quot;the
<br>
fallacy of the best&quot; when I was spending a lot of time studying Buddhism and
<br>
also pursuing a formal course of East Asian studies in the 1970s.  I'm sure
<br>
folks of my generation recall the flood of books about Buddhism available to
<br>
curious Western students during the 1960s and 70s.  I've got a bookshelf
<br>
full of them, both of the popular variety (Alan Watts, Gary Snyder, Babba
<br>
Ram Das/Richard Alpert etc.) and of the more scholarly kind (a couple by
<br>
Bhikshu Sangharakshita being among my favorites from the time, I see from
<br>
the well-thumbed and marked-up pages).  What I discovered as I read these
<br>
kinds of books, while at the same time studying the over-all history of East
<br>
Asia and specifically the reality &quot;on the ground&quot; in particular places, was
<br>
a significant disparity between what I found in the books about Buddhism
<br>
available to Western students -- and the kinds of people who were going
<br>
about the work of explaining Buddhism in the West -- on the one hand, and
<br>
the actual practice and perception of Buddhism in East Asia on the other.&gt;
<br>
<p>I would echo this sentiment. You find this in virtually every sort of
<br>
religous/
<br>
spiritual phenomena that's written up in Western lit.  Shamanism is very
<br>
similar. In theory it's a marvelous snapshot of the motivations and
<br>
timeless beliefs of preliteracy world over. In practice you sortof get
<br>
this vague feeling that maybe Catholocism is not so bad by comparison
<br>
to gibbering atavistic savagery.  &quot;Fallacy of the best&quot;..that's a very well-
<br>
turned phrase!
