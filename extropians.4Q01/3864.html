I think when Nick talks about Ancestor Simulations, what he means is
<br>
simulation of intelligent beings (possibly by simulating an entire universe
<br>
from big bang forwards). This would be distinct from (well, a superset of)
<br>
the idea of posthumans specifically simulating their own history in order to
<br>
&quot;reanimate&quot; their own real ancestors.

<p>&gt;One question.  Exactly why would posthumans run &quot;ancestor
&gt;simulations&quot;?  Or perhaps I should ask for clarification and
&gt;expansion of that phrase.

It's not hard to think of other possible motivations: curiosity, art, 
nostalgia, wanting to &quot;step into the past&quot; and act out the role of a 
historically significant person, science of alternative routes of
history, 
habitat for diseased or uploaded people, etc. What's interesting is that
<p>future society will lack individuals with any of these desires or is
very 
effective in preventing them from acting on them, or else we are in a 
simulation.
<p>(Another possible cool reason for setting up simulations of various
sorts, 
and to reward their inhabitants for virtuous behavior, is to create 
uncertainty about whether one is living in such a simulation. If one is 
uncertain about that, one would get an extra reason to act morally.)
