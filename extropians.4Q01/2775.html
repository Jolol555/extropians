<p>&lt;&lt;Can This New Surgery Actually Revive a Dying Heart? 
<br>
Upstart Bioheart's complex cell-transfer procedure offers hope against 
<br>
America's No. 1 killer 
<br>
<p>Ten people in Europe are making medical history. Their damaged hearts have 
<br>
all been rejuvenated with the help of implanted cells taken from their 
<br>
thighs. The technique was pioneered by a tiny Fort Lauderdale startup called 
<br>
Bioheart Inc., and it is groundbreaking for a number of reasons--not least 
<br>
because it offers hope to millions of heart attack victims. But the technique 
<br>
also marks an important step forward in the nascent field of medicine known 
<br>
as tissue engineering. Scientists have successfully prodded the human body 
<br>
into regrowing skin, cartilage, bone, and even corneas by manipulating cells. 
<br>
The Bioheart patients, however, represent one of the first successes in 
<br>
regenerating portions of a far more complex organ.
<br>
<p>It is still very early days for this technique, known as myogenesis, but it 
<br>
is already generating considerable buzz among heart disease specialists. 
<br>
Status reports on the 10 patients will be given at a special session during 
<br>
the American Heart Assn. annual meeting in mid-November. Guidant Corp. (&gt;GDT&lt;/A&gt; 
<br>
), a maker of medical devices, was intrigued enough to invest $1.5 million in 
<br>
two-year-old Bioheart in June. And another tissue engineering company, Osiris 
<br>
Therapeutics Inc., is developing a similar technique, which has yet to be 
<br>
tested in humans...&gt;
