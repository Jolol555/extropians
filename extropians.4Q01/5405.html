<p>I'm unsure whether Brian is the author of the above quote (due to
<br>
multi-quoting/indirection) but it *is* worth noting that the
<br>
concept that one can &quot;defend oneself&quot; with &quot;guns&quot; is horribly
<br>
outdated in our current &quot;reality&quot;.  I am not arguing for or
<br>
against guns -- but the argument that they allow one to &quot;completely&quot;
<br>
defend oneself *does* from my perspective generate a false sense of security.
<br>
<p>I'll simply point out the risks the average person faces from the
<br>
&quot;medical community&quot;.  &quot;Doctors Deadlier Than Guns&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.tysknews.com/Depts/2nd_Amend/doctors_deadlier_than_guns.htm">http://www.tysknews.com/Depts/2nd_Amend/doctors_deadlier_than_guns.htm</a>
<br>
<p>While I realize the news media has probably gone overboard on this
<br>
I do not think it unreasonable for reasonable people to engage in
<br>
a pragmatic (informed) discussion of the relative risks they face
<br>
(be they in their drinking water, violence from &quot;criminals&quot;, maltreatement
<br>
by &quot;professionals&quot;, random acts of violence or error by the public,
<br>
comet or asteroid strikes by uncaring hunks of matter running around
<br>
our solar system, etc.)
<br>
<p>THE *ONLY* WAY TO HAVE A RATIONAL DISCUSSION IS TO UNDERSTAND
<br>
THE SPECIFIC RISKS IN SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS AND THEIR HAZARD
<br>
FUNCTIONS RELATIVE TO EACH OTHER.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly why do you have such a low opinion of people around here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you expect them to &quot;run amok&quot; with or without guns?  Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assure you that many people on here are quite capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designing weapons far more lethal than mere guns if they were of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mind to &quot;run amok&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>Samantha has raised an extremely valid point here.  I can presumably
<br>
be cited as an individual with both the knowledge and potentially
<br>
the means to &quot;run amok&quot;.   Using the classical perspective,
<br>
all I lack is a &quot;motive&quot; for doing so.  Looking around the
<br>
world I see plenty of people with &quot;motive&quot; and potentially
<br>
the means -- all they are lacking is &quot;knowledge&quot;.  That
<br>
seems to be a very low barrier (at least to me).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My feeling is that you are suffering from a singular lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagination on this point.
</em><br>
<p>I would have to agree.  I would have to say that the whole &quot;guns&quot;
<br>
debate as it currently structured tends to be nothing but a disservice
<br>
to humanity.  It is a false security to believe that having control
<br>
of a weapon protects you in cases where the pilot of your airplane
<br>
suffers from a reality-shifting mental condition or your drinking
<br>
water has been poisoned by a terrorist.
<br>
<p>Identify the relative risks.  Estimate the relative costs of
<br>
dealing with them in a reliable manner.  Engage in a rational
<br>
discussion, recognizing that opinions are likely to be very
<br>
locale (country/city) specific.  Do I think the risks I face
<br>
in Seattle Washington are the same as those I face in Moscow
<br>
Russia?  Not!  Be adept or be disassembled.
