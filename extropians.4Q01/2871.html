<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;NOTE: Spike &amp; Mike &amp; Co., please hold your fire. I already know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;what your take on this is, and it's not without merit...
</em><br>
<p>Alex, I am not a hawk.  I hate war, all war.  I never want to
<br>
see another shot fired in anger.  I consider myself a techno-dove,
<br>
one who believes that the way to peace is with vastly superior
<br>
weapons and a generous attitude.
<br>
<p>That being said, there are many threads on extropians that
<br>
I would like to reply to, but current circumstances do not permit.
<br>
I just returned from a trip to southern Taxifornia to view the
<br>
Leonids under the dry air east of L.A.
<br>
<p>Things did not turn out as I had planned, for we learned that
<br>
my sister in law has a cancerous ovary, so the family ended
<br>
up gathering in Riverside to put our heads together.  She goes
<br>
in for surgery Wednesday.  They have found the tumor early
<br>
enough that her prognosis is excellent and will likely not require
<br>
radiation or chemotherapy.  Indeed, the medics are fussing over
<br>
the best way to save the ovary.  (Aint modern medicine great?).
<br>
<p>I suggested they remove the organ and freeze it in liquid
<br>
nitrogen for future use, being as she still wants to breed.
<br>
Failing that, remove the ovary, extract the ova therein,
<br>
fertilize them all and freeze the embryos for future use.
<br>
I shall be away for a while, so Ill tell you what happened
<br>
in about a week and a half.  spike
