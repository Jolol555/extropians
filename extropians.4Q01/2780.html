Hmmmm...
<br>
<p>Doug posted this URL:

<br>
<p>which seems really interesting when I look at this URL
<br>
recently posted to the Europa list:

<p>Not much of a window from the time MiniSation 1 goes up (2004)
<br>
until the time the Russions want to stop flying the lifeboats up
<br>
to the ISS (January 2005).
<br>
<p>However if NASA takes the bait and funds 2 Soyuz life boats
<br>
then that means a flight every quarter presumably paid for
<br>
by NASA.  But that is only ~2 weeks (out of 12) per quarter
<br>
of MiniStation &quot;occupation time&quot; leaving room for 5x as many
<br>
&quot;private&quot; flights.  I wonder if the demand for that is there
<br>
at $20M/flight?
<br>
<p>In response to G.P. -- I do not consider &quot;space development&quot;
<br>
to be preparing the way for human settlements in space.
<br>
I consider &quot;space development&quot; to be the development of
<br>
the designs and manufacturing capability that can utilize
<br>
space resources in a productive fashion (e.g. the construction
<br>
of solar cells from materials in smaller gravity wells than
<br>
the Earth, the harvesting of fuel resources (H/O) from aged
<br>
comets, etc.).  Some of the papers from the Colorado conference
<br>
are focused on these issues.  Humans did not evolve to be compatible
<br>
with the environment in space -- we should evolve &quot;machines&quot;
<br>
compatible with that environment, preferably derived from
<br>
resources found in that environment -- only in those
<br>
circumstances will you have real development.
<br>
<p>Will humans eventually go there?  Yes of course, but only after
<br>
we have developed the technology of effectively using the resources
<br>
one finds there (think plows, tractors, dams, blast furnaces, etc.).
<br>
<p>We have put the cart before the horse for too long and need to
<br>
correct that situation.
