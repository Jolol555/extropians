<p>Evolution can be used in two senses, as 'change' and as 'biological
<br>
evolution'. The later is most common here on the list, although many
<br>
seem to like to use the first term often too.
<br>
<p>Biological evolution is *a* learning process, and has produced the kinds
<br>
of learning our nervous system currently can do. But it is based on the
<br>
approach of &quot;reproduce, vary, select&quot; rather than the learning
<br>
strategies we commonly use (the closest would be trial and error, which 
<br>
is really a kind of reinforcement learning with an internally generated 
<br>
reinforcment signal).

</em><br>
<p>Have you met an autist? They don't perceive themselves as missing
<br>
something. If people do not act as expected, the people are *wrong*.
<br>
People with Asperger's learn to understand that they are missing
<br>
something, and can consciously emulate the &quot;thought-reading&quot; most of us
<br>
do unconsciously every day. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;But the real issue is: is mild autism disorders like Asperger something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we should try to fix in others? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ethos should be taken into account, but I'm not focusing on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My interests are solely biology and evolution, and what they say is possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The word fix was a poor choice. A better word, would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutate/adapt/evolve/emerge, or simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change. 
</em><br>
<p>Researchers ignoring the ethos is what makes bioconservatives like Leon
<br>
Kass the bioethics advisor to the president rather than Max More. If you
<br>
only look at what is possible, and not what is desirable, somebody else
<br>
is going to define desirability for you. And that might be a person with
<br>
a very nasty agenda. I think transhumanism can play its most important
<br>
role by formulating a positive ethos of human change; we will not be the
<br>
central researchers, but we can give them the reasons and arguments they
<br>
need to defend and promote their research.
