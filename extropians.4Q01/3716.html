Dean's Machine: Will cities allow it to share the sidewalk with pedestrians?
<br>
<p>Sunday, Dec. 02, 2001
<br>
&quot;Come to me!&quot;
<br>
<p>On a quiet Sunday morning in Silicon Valley, I am standing atop a machine
<br>
code-named Ginger--a machine that may be the most eagerly awaited and
<br>
wildly, if inadvertently, hyped high-tech product since the Apple Macintosh.
<br>
Fifty feet away, Ginger's diminutive inventor, Dean Kamen, is offering
<br>
instruction on how to use it, which in this case means waving his hands and
<br>
barking out orders.
<br>
<p>&quot;Just lean forward,&quot; Kamen commands, so I do, and instantly I start rolling
<br>
across the concrete right at him.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now, stop,&quot; Kamen says. How? This thing has no brakes. &quot;Just think about
<br>
stopping.&quot; Staring into the middle distance, I conjure an image of a red
<br>
stop sign--and just like that, Ginger and I come to a halt.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now think about backing up.&quot; Once again, I follow instructions, and soon I
<br>
glide in reverse to where I started. With a twist of the wrist, I pirouette
<br>
in place, and no matter which way I lean or how hard, Ginger refuses to let
<br>
me fall over. What's going on here is all perfectly explicable--the machine
<br>
is sensing and reacting to subtle shifts in my balance--but for the moment I
<br>
am slack-jawed, baffled. It was Arthur C. Clarke who famously observed that
<br>
&quot;any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; By
<br>
that standard, Ginger is advanced indeed.
<br>
<p>Since last January it has also been the tech world's most-speculated-about
<br>
secret. That was when a book proposal about Ginger, a.k.a. &quot;IT,&quot; got leaked
<br>
to the website Inside.com. Kamen had been working on Ginger for more than a
<br>
decade, and although the author (with whom the inventor is no longer
<br>
collaborating) never revealed what Ginger was, his precis included
<br>
over-the-top assessments from some of Silicon Valley's mightiest kingpins.
<br>
As big a deal as the PC, said Steve Jobs; maybe bigger than the Internet,
<br>
said John Doerr, the venture capitalist behind Netscape, Amazon.com and now
<br>
Ginger.
<br>
<p>In a heartbeat, hundreds of stories full of fevered theorizing gushed forth
<br>
in the press. Ginger was a hydrogen-powered hovercraft. Or a magnetic
<br>
antigravity device. Or, closer to the mark, a souped-up scooter. Even the
<br>
reprobates at South Park got into the act, spoofing Ginger in a recent
<br>
episode--the details of which, sadly, are unprintable in a family magazine.
<br>
<p>This week the guessing game comes to an end as Kamen unveils his baby under
<br>
its official name: Segway. Given the buildup, some are bound to be
<br>
disappointed. (&quot;It won't beam you to Mars or turn lead into gold,&quot; shrugs
<br>
Kamen. &quot;So sue me.&quot;) But there is no denying that the Segway is an
<br>
engineering marvel. Developed at a cost of more than $100 million, Kamen's
<br>
vehicle is a complex bundle of hardware and software that mimics the human
<br>
body's ability to maintain its balance. Not only does it have no brakes, it
<br>
also has no engine, no throttle, no gearshift and no steering wheel. And it
<br>
can carry the average rider for a full day, nonstop, on only five cents'
<br>
worth of electricity.
<br>
<p>The commercial ambitions of Kamen and his team are as advanced as their
<br>
technical virtuosity. By stealing a slice of the $300 billion-plus
<br>
transportation industry, Doerr predicts, the Segway Co. will be the fastest
<br>
outfit in history to reach $1 billion in sales. To get there, the firm has
<br>
erected a 77,000-sq.-ft. factory a few miles from its Manchester, N.H.,
<br>
headquarters that will be capable of churning out 40,000 Segways a month by
<br>
the end of next year.
<br>
<p>Kamen's aspirations are even grander than that. He believes the Segway &quot;will
<br>
be to the car what the car was to the horse and buggy.&quot; He imagines them
<br>
everywhere: in parks and at Disneyland, on battlefields and factory floors,
<br>
but especially on downtown sidewalks from Seattle to Shanghai. &quot;Cars are
<br>
great for going long distances,&quot; Kamen says, &quot;but it makes no sense at all
<br>
for people in cities to use a 4,000-lb. piece of metal to haul their 150-lb.
<br>
asses around town.&quot; In the future he envisions, cars will be banished from
<br>
urban centers to make room for millions of &quot;empowered
<br>
pedestrians&quot;--empowered, naturally, by Kamen's brainchild.
<br>
<p>Kamen's dream of a Segway-saturated world won't come true overnight. In
<br>
fact, ordinary folks won't be able to buy the machines for at least a year,
<br>
when a consumer model is expected to go on sale for about $3,000. For now,
<br>
the first customers to test the Segway will be deep-pocketed institutions
<br>
such as the U.S. Postal Service and General Electric, the National Parks
<br>
Service and Amazon.com--institutions capable of shelling out about $8,000
<br>
apiece for industrial-strength models. And Kamen's dreamworld won't arrive
<br>
at all unless he and his team can navigate the array of obstacles that are
<br>
sure to be thrown up by competitors and ever cautious regulators.
<br>
<p>For the past three months, Kamen has allowed TIME behind the veil of secrecy
<br>
as he and his team grappled with the questions that they will
<br>
confront--about everything from safety and pricing to the challenges of
<br>
launching a product with the country at war and the economy in recession.
<br>
Some of their answers were smooth and assured; others less polished. But one
<br>
thing was clear. As Kamen sees it, all these issues will quickly fade if the
<br>
question most people ask about the Segway is &quot;How do I get one?&quot;
<br>
<p>Fred and Ginger
<br>
<p>The world of technology has never been short of eccentrics and obsessives,
<br>
of rich, brilliant oddballs with strange habits and stranger hobbies. But
<br>
even in this crowd, Dean Kamen stands out. The 50-year-old son of a
<br>
comic-book artist, he is a college dropout, a self-taught physicist and
<br>
mechanical engineer with a handful of honorary doctorates, a
<br>
multimillionaire who wears the same outfit for every occasion: blue jeans, a
<br>
blue work shirt and a pair of Timberland boots. With the accent of his
<br>
native Long Island, he speaks slowly, passionately--and endlessly. &quot;If you
<br>
ask Dean the time,&quot; Doerr chides, &quot;he'll first explain the theory of general
<br>
relativity, then how to build an atomic clock, and then, maybe, he'll tell
<br>
you what time it is.&quot;
<br>
<p>A bachelor, Kamen lives near Manchester in a hexagonally shaped,
<br>
32,000-sq.-ft. house he designed. Outside, there's a giant wind turbine to
<br>
generate power and a fully lighted baseball diamond; in the basement, a
<br>
foundry and a machine shop. Kamen's vehicles include a Hummer, a Porsche and
<br>
two helicopters--both of which he helped design and one of which he uses to
<br>
commute to work each day. He also owns an island off the coast of
<br>
Connecticut. He calls it North Dumpling, and he considers it a sovereign
<br>
state. It has a flag, a navy, a currency (one bill has the value of pi) and
<br>
a mutual nonaggression pact with the U.S., signed by Kamen and the first
<br>
President Bush (as a joke, we think).
<br>
<p>But if Kamen's personality is half Willy Wonka, the other half is closer to
<br>
Thomas Edison. While he was still struggling in college, Kamen invented the
<br>
first drug-infusion pump, which enabled doctors to deliver steady, reliable
<br>
doses to patients. In the years that followed, he invented the first
<br>
portable insulin pump, the first portable dialysis machine and an array of
<br>
heart stents, one of which now resides inside Vice President Dick Cheney.
<br>
This string of successes established Kamen's reputation, made him wealthy
<br>
and turned DEKA Research--the R.-and-D. lab he founded nearly 20 years ago,
<br>
in which he and 200 engineers work along the banks of the Merrimack
<br>
River--into a kind of Mecca for medical-device design.
<br>
<p>The seeds of Ginger were planted at DEKA by what had previously been Kamen's
<br>
best-known project: the IBOT wheelchair. Developed for and funded by Johnson
<br>
&amp; Johnson, the IBOT is Kamen's bid to &quot;give the disabled the same kind of
<br>
mobility the rest of us take for granted&quot;--a six-wheel machine that goes up
<br>
and down curbs, cruises effortlessly through sand or gravel, and even climbs
<br>
stairs. More amazing still, the IBOT features something called standing
<br>
mode, in which it rises up on its wheels and lifts its occupant to eye level
<br>
while maintaining balance with such stability that it can't be knocked over
<br>
even by a violent shove. Kamen gets annoyed when the IBOT is called a
<br>
wheelchair. It is, he says, &quot;the world's most sophisticated robot.&quot;
<br>
<p>As Kamen and his team were working on the IBOT, it dawned on them that they
<br>
were onto something bigger. &quot;We realized we could build a device using very
<br>
similar technology that could impact how everybody gets around,&quot; he says.
<br>
The IBot was also the source of Ginger's mysterious code name. &quot;Watching the
<br>
IBOT, we used to say, 'Look at that light, graceful robot, dancing up the
<br>
stairs'--so we started referring to it as Fred Upstairs, after Fred
<br>
Astaire,&quot; Kamen recalls. &quot;After we built Fred, it was only natural to name
<br>
its smaller partner Ginger.&quot;
<br>
<p>With Ginger, as with the IBOT, Kamen explains, &quot;the big idea is to put a
<br>
human being into a system where the machine acts as an extension of your
<br>
body.&quot; On first inspection, balancing on Ginger seems only slightly more
<br>
feasible than balancing on a barbell. But what Kamen is talking about is the
<br>
way Ginger does the balancing for you. Lean forward, go forward; lean back,
<br>
go back; turn by twisting your wrist. The experience is the same going
<br>
uphill, downhill or across any kind of terrain--even ice. It is nothing like
<br>
riding a bike or a motorcycle. Instead, in the words of Vern Loucks, the
<br>
former chairman of Baxter International and a Segway board member, &quot;it's
<br>
like skiing without the snow.&quot;
<br>
<p>Exactly how the Segway achieves this effect isn't easy to explain; Kamen's
<br>
first stab at it involves a blizzard of equations. Eventually, though, he
<br>
offers this: &quot;When you walk, you're really in what's called a controlled
<br>
fall. You off-balance yourself, putting one foot in front of the other and
<br>
falling onto them over and over again. In the same way, when you use a
<br>
Segway, there's a gyroscope that acts like your inner ear, a computer that
<br>
acts like your brain, motors that act like your muscles, wheels that act
<br>
like your feet. Suddenly, you feel like you have on a pair of magic
<br>
sneakers, and instead of falling forward, you go sailing across the room.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pulling off this trick requires an unholy amount of computer power. In every
<br>
Segway there are 10 microprocessors cranking out three PCs' worth of juice.
<br>
Also a cluster of aviation-grade gyros, an accelerometer, a bevy of sensors,
<br>
two batteries and software so sophisticated it puts Microsoft to shame. If
<br>
Kamen gets irked when the IBOT is called a wheelchair, imagine his pique
<br>
when--if--the Segway is called a scooter.
<br>
<p>Fish and Bicycles
<br>
<p>The possibility that the segway will be viewed as simply a high-end toy, a
<br>
jet ski on wheels, is one of Kamen's greatest concerns, especially after
<br>
Sept. 11. He wants his machine taken seriously, as a serious solution to
<br>
serious problems. That anxiety was one of the reasons he and his team
<br>
decided to concentrate at first on major corporations, universities and
<br>
government agencies--large, solid, established institutions--rather than
<br>
dive straight into the consumer marketplace.
<br>
<p>Whether such institutions would embrace Segways, however, was an open
<br>
question. Before last January's leak, Kamen had demoed his invention only
<br>
when absolutely necessary, or for luminaries such as Steve Jobs and Amazon
<br>
CEO Jeff Bezos. After the leak, he became even pickier. He entertained the
<br>
Postmaster General, who was keen to put letter carriers on Segways, and the
<br>
head of the National Parks Service, who wanted to do the same with park
<br>
rangers and police. (Both are among Segway's first customers.) Kamen also
<br>
stirred up interest at the Department of Defense, which was intrigued by the
<br>
notion of giving Segways to special forces, and at Federal Express. But few
<br>
other potential customers were allowed to pass through DEKA's tightly sealed
<br>
doors.
<br>
<p>A few weeks ago, with the launch approaching, Kamen began to let some others
<br>
in. The Boston police department sent a clutch of cops to Manchester. The
<br>
city of Atlanta sent a contingent of city planners. And Thanksgiving week,
<br>
Kamen took his act to California. In one jam-packed day in Silicon Valley,
<br>
he revealed the Segway to officials from San Francisco International
<br>
Airport, the California department of transportation, the city of Palo Alto,
<br>
Stanford University and Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers. Especially
<br>
gratifying to Kamen was the reaction of Andy Grove, the chairman of Intel
<br>
and, unlike so many Silicon Valley boosters, a bone-deep skeptic. Perched
<br>
tentatively on the machine, the 65-year-old Grove was rolling slowly along
<br>
when Doerr ambled over and pushed him in the chest. When the Segway kept him
<br>
from losing his balance, Grove emitted a distinctly un-Grove-like giggle.
<br>
&quot;The machine is gorgeous,&quot; he said later. &quot;I'm no good at balancing; it
<br>
would take me a hundred years to learn to snowboard. This took me less than
<br>
five minutes.&quot;
<br>
<p>I asked Grove what he thought of the Segway as a business. &quot;The consumer
<br>
market is always harder,&quot; he said. &quot;But when you think about it, the
<br>
corporate market is almost unlimited. If the Postal Service and FedEx deploy
<br>
this for all their carriers, the company will be busy for the next five
<br>
years just keeping up with that demand.&quot;
<br>
<p>A patient entrepreneur would revel in that assessment. But Kamen is a man
<br>
running short on patience. For him, conquering the corporate market is
<br>
merely a prelude to the battle to come. &quot;The consumer market is where the
<br>
big money is,&quot; says Michael Schmertzler, a Credit Suisse First Boston
<br>
managing director and, with Doerr, Segway's other major financial backer.
<br>
&quot;But this is about more than money for Dean. Pardon the cliche, but he
<br>
really does want to change the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>With the Segway, Kamen plans to change the world by changing how cities are
<br>
organized. To Kamen's way of thinking, the problem is the automobile.
<br>
&quot;Cities need cars like fish need bicycles,&quot; he says. Segways, he believes,
<br>
are ideal for downtown transportation. Unlike cars, they are cheap, clean,
<br>
efficient, maneuverable. Unlike bicycles, they are designed specifically to
<br>
be pedestrian friendly. &quot;A bike is too slow and light to mix with trucks in
<br>
the street but too large and fast to mix with pedestrians on the sidewalk,&quot;
<br>
he argues. &quot;Our machine is compatible with the sidewalk. If a Segway hits
<br>
you, it's like being hit by another pedestrian.&quot; By traveling at three or
<br>
four times walking speed, and thus turning what would have been a 30-minute
<br>
walk into a 10-minute ride, Kamen contends, Segways will in effect shrink
<br>
cities to the point where cars &quot;will not only be undesirable, but
<br>
unnecessary.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kamen isn't so naive as to underestimate America's long-standing romance
<br>
with the automobile. (&quot;I love cars too,&quot; he says. &quot;Just not when I'm
<br>
downtown.&quot;) And he is well aware that uprooting the vast urban
<br>
infrastructure that supports cars, from parking garages to bridges and
<br>
tunnels, won't happen soon. Which is why he has pinned his greatest hopes
<br>
not on the U.S. but abroad, especially in the developing world. At a meeting
<br>
with Jobs a year ago, the Apple co-founder proclaimed, in typically
<br>
hyperbolic fashion, &quot;If enough people see this machine, you won't have to
<br>
convince them to architect cities around it; it'll just happen.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kamen agrees. &quot;Most people in the developing world can't afford cars, and if
<br>
they could, it would be a complete disaster,&quot; he says. &quot;If you were building
<br>
one of the new cities of China, would you do it the way we have? Wouldn't it
<br>
make more sense to build a mass-transit system around the city and leave the
<br>
central couple of square miles for pedestrians only?&quot; Pedestrians and people
<br>
riding Segways, that is.
<br>
<p>&quot;There's no question in my mind that we have the right answer,&quot; he
<br>
continues. &quot;I would stake my reputation, my money and my time on the fact
<br>
that 10 years from now, this will be the way many people in many places get
<br>
around.&quot; Kamen pauses and sighs. &quot;If all we end up with are a few
<br>
billion-dollar niche markets, that would be a disappointment. It's not like
<br>
our goal was just to put the golf-cart industry out of business.&quot;
<br>
<p>Remember Tucker?
<br>
<p>One of the hardest truths for any technologist to hear is that success or
<br>
failure in business is rarely determined by the quality of the technology.
<br>
Betamax was better than VHS; the Mac operating system is superior to
<br>
Windows. Even in the transportation business, there is the cautionary tale
<br>
of Preston Tucker, who in the 1940s designed a &quot;car of the future&quot; packed
<br>
with such safety innovations as a padded dashboard, disk brakes and safety
<br>
glass--a car so far ahead of its time that only 51 were ever produced. In
<br>
fact, the annals of high-tech history contain remarkably few cases in which
<br>
the most innovative technology has emerged triumphant in the marketplace.
<br>
<p>This is the sort of thing that keeps Kamen up at night. There are countless
<br>
others. High on the list are congenitally skittish regulators who will
<br>
decide if the Segway is safe and if it will be allowed to roll on sidewalks.
<br>
<p>Kamen maintains, with characteristic chutzpah, that Segways are &quot;even safer
<br>
than walking.&quot; Only slightly less emphatic, and slightly more plausible, was
<br>
the verdict of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which began reviewing
<br>
the device last May. According to Ron Medford, a senior CPSC official, the
<br>
Segway has &quot;safety features that are far more substantial than we normally
<br>
see in a consumer product--features closer to those associated with medical
<br>
devices.&quot; (Medford, it must be said, was so impressed that he is taking a
<br>
sabbatical at DEKA, though he remains on the government's payroll.) To make
<br>
the machine even safer, it comes equipped with three computerized keys that
<br>
set speed and performance limits. The slowest setting, now called training
<br>
mode, used to be jokingly referred to around DEKA as CEO mode.
<br>
<p>The sidewalk issue is dicier. In order to ensure that Segways are permitted
<br>
to move alongside pedestrians, Kamen's regulatory-affairs mavens will have
<br>
to keep the machine from being classified either as a motor vehicle or as a
<br>
scooter. At the federal level, the deal is done--though, for a while, the
<br>
Occupational Safety and Health Administration wanted to classify the Segway
<br>
as a &quot;powered industrial truck.&quot; Technically, final sidewalk authority rests
<br>
with state and local governments. Kamen is betting, however, that the
<br>
decision will be made not by lawmakers but &quot;de facto, by what becomes
<br>
standard practice. If we have police and mail carriers riding on the
<br>
sidewalks for a year, how is anyone in government going to say, 'It's O.K.
<br>
for us but not O.K. for you'?&quot;
<br>
<p>No matter how inherently safe Segways may be, someone, somewhere is going to
<br>
kill himself on one. &quot;It's inevitable,&quot; says Gary Bridge, Segway's marketing
<br>
chief. &quot;I dread that day.&quot; Never mind that people die every day on bicycles,
<br>
in crosswalks, on skateboards, in cars. The Segway is the newest new thing,
<br>
and nothing does more to set hearts afire on the contingency-fee bar. &quot;There
<br>
are some very deep pockets around this thing,&quot; remarks Andy Grove. &quot;I fear
<br>
this could be a litigation lightning rod.&quot;
<br>
<p>Not to mention a lightning rod for fierce competition. Although Kamen
<br>
trashes the automobile at every opportunity and is plotting a future in
<br>
which cars are barred from cities, he insists that the Big Three and their
<br>
brethren will see the Segway as no threat. &quot;Nobody in America or any
<br>
developed nation will buy one of these instead of buying a car,&quot; he says.
<br>
&quot;People will buy these in addition to owning a car.&quot; But a former top auto
<br>
executive thinks Kamen is kidding himself--or kidding me. &quot;The car companies
<br>
track market share by one one-hundredths of a percentage point,&quot; he says.
<br>
&quot;They're incredibly sensitive on that front, and this is going to dent
<br>
somebody's market share.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even if the auto barons leave the Segway alone, other players are unlikely
<br>
to be so forgiving. When Kamen and his lieutenants draw up lists of probable
<br>
rivals, companies in other branches of the transportation industry--firms
<br>
that make ATVs, motorcycles, scooters, even snowmobiles--are near the top.
<br>
But the lists have been long and varied, including a raft of appliance
<br>
makers, engineering companies and, especially, consumer-electronics giants,
<br>
such as Sony. Kamen's team is confident it has a long technological lead, as
<br>
well as patents on most of its key innovations. &quot;Reverse engineering this
<br>
thing won't be easy,&quot; says Schmertzler. &quot;This is not a pet rock.&quot; Yet if the
<br>
Segway is a runaway hit, you can bet that a flood of knock-offs--much less
<br>
sophisticated but also much cheaper--will soon wash over the market.
<br>
<p>Will the Segway be a runaway hit? A device that reduces the need for
<br>
walking, one of the healthiest activities known to man, may strike many
<br>
people as the last thing our culture needs. (Kamen scoffs, &quot;Because I give
<br>
kids calculators doesn't make them stupider.&quot;) And three grand may strike
<br>
many others as an awful lot to pay for something they've managed so far to
<br>
live happily without. John Doerr, who helped bankroll Compaq in the infant
<br>
days of the personal-computer industry, points out that the first PCs cost
<br>
$3,000 to $5,000. The analogy is worth pondering. The brave souls who bought
<br>
those early PCs were willing to cough up big bucks not simply to own
<br>
computers that were small and powerful but also to be part of a kind of
<br>
revolutionary vanguard. Will consumers today make the same calculation about
<br>
the Segway?
<br>
<p>If it's seen as sufficiently cool, they might. But here Segway faces a
<br>
double-edged sword. If not for the media frenzy a year ago, Kamen and his
<br>
invention would be receiving a good deal less attention. At the same time,
<br>
that frenzy ginned up expectations so absurdly extravagant that they will be
<br>
hard to live up to. There is a very real possibility that for those whose
<br>
only experience of the Segway is on TV or in the press, the reaction to it
<br>
may boil down to five lethal words: Is that all it is? And that possibility
<br>
is only enhanced by the fact that to many eyes giving the photos only a
<br>
cursory glance, a Segway doesn't look like a revolution. It looks...well,
<br>
sorta like a scooter.
<br>
<p>But looks can be misleading, as anyone who's ridden a Segway can attest.
<br>
Just ask Jeff Bezos. On a rainy morning in Seattle recently, Bezos dropped
<br>
in at a meeting between Kamen, his team and a pair of Amazon execs. The
<br>
meeting was being held in an Amazon &quot;pick and pack&quot; facility--a warehouse in
<br>
which employees pick stock from shelves and pack it in boxes for shipment to
<br>
customers. Kamen had come to sell Amazon some Segways by demonstrating that
<br>
they would, as Bezos put it, &quot;improve our picking productivity.&quot;
<br>
<p>Like Grove, Bezos is confident that Segway will make a mint selling to the
<br>
corporate market; also like Grove, he is less certain about its consumer
<br>
prospects. &quot;At Amazon, we didn't know at first, and nobody knew, whether
<br>
people would want to buy books online, and the same is true for whether
<br>
people will want to ride these,&quot; he says. &quot;Walking is a superb mechanism for
<br>
getting around--I don't see it being replaced anytime soon. And for long
<br>
hauls, driving is darn good too. The question is whether there's a middle
<br>
ground, some intermediate zone where these would be better than all the
<br>
alternatives?&quot;
<br>
<p>Just then, Kamen rides up and hands his Segway over to Bezos. As the Amazon
<br>
boss races madly around the warehouse, hooting and cackling and flapping his
<br>
arms, someone yells out, &quot;Yo, Jeff, what were you saying about the consumer
<br>
market?&quot; Whizzing past, Bezos shouts back, &quot;There's definitely at least a
<br>
consumer market of one!&quot;
