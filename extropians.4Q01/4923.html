<p>This tactic of calling something you disagree with a religion is getting

very tedious. It's also a lazy way of not having to make an argument, 
<br>
instead slandering something in a community of mostly non-religious people. 
<br>
Give us a break. Or wait until you have your own views referred to as 
<br>
religious by someone who disagrees with you (like a humanist dismissing 
<br>
your transhumanist views). See if you find it a constructive, intelligent 
<br>
approach.

<p>A curious view. If markets have shortcomings, as they surely do, the 
<br>
advance of technology -- so far -- seems to help remedy them. For instance, 
<br>
markets have a difficult time with a few public goods problems (though 
<br>
there may be ways around them that are not being used, such as conditional 
<br>
contracts). Establishing private property rights in things like schools of 
<br>
fish or airborne pollutants might have been practically impossible in the 
<br>
past. A government solution, crude as it might be may work better. I'd 
<br>
grant that there *may* be a reasonable role for government in funding basic 
<br>
research. (See, I'm not a libertarian.) However, with more advanced 
<br>
tracking technology, defining and tracking such property becomes more 
<br>
feasible. I can't think of an instance where advancing technology favors 
<br>
more government.
<br>
<p>I'm curious to know if you have some real thinking behind your comment. It 
<br>
seems to indicate that you agree that nonmarket economies have real 
<br>
problems. How do you see those problems being fixed by technology? (And why 
<br>
wouldn't those technologies at the same help markets work more effectively 
<br>
-- just as we see happening now, as with Web-enabled supply chain 
<br>
management, customer relationship management software, KM, customer 
<br>
analytics, embedded wireless RFID tags in tracking, etc. etc.?) If markets 
<br>
are generally better right now, why not support them until something 
<br>
clearly better comes along?
<br>
<p>Onward!
