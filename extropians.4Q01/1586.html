<p><em>&gt;I think that the age of downloading will probably reduce the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amount of money that goes to artists, and will certainly produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least a temporary reduction in quality until a new generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of topnotch artists willing to work for free arrives to replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the current cream of the crop, who have grown up expecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;payment.  But I also think that the age of downloading has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enormously powerful forces behind it, verging on inevitability. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Music as material good, as tape or record, is dead.  Now it's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;informational good and can be copied.  I don't know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information wants to be free, but information certainly wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be downloaded.  In the new world, people who want information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;download that information.  If prices are set too high, they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;download without paying.
</em><br>
<p>Theft of copyrighted material is theft no matter what those who do
<br>
it say to try and justify it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Each additional download creates wealth, because information is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinitely duplicable good.  If we all paid exactly the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amount to artists and middlemen, but got ten times as much content
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at one-tenth the price per unit, the net effect on industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revenues would be zero, and yet an enormous amount of wealth would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been created.  That's why information wants to be downloaded. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't say it wants to be free, but it definitely wants to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;downloaded, because each download creates wealth.  Whether money
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gets transferred, and where it goes, is almost a side issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compared to downloading; money is conserved, but downloading is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinite.  Information just wants you to download it - it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really care whether downloading ten times as much information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;costs you ten times as much money, or twice as much money, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same amount of money, or half as much money, just so long as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;download.  Information wants to be downloaded because each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;additional download creates new wealth; money doesn't care whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hands it's in because that doesn't create wealth one way or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other.  But, in real life, I think that this effect will tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reduce total industry revenues - regardless of whether that's good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or bad for the individual artists, or for the art - because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;puts control of wealth flow in the hands of the downloaders, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shifts the payment motive from &quot;pay for what you take&quot; to &quot;pay for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what you copy&quot;, two entirely different ethics.
</em><br>
<p>Each download that is paid for increases wealth, each download that
<br>
is stolen decreases both wealth and value.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;So I understand that the artists are upset, and that the middlemen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are in a state of crazed fear, but whatever solutions they try are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to have to fit with the two new facts: first, information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wants to be downloaded; and second, whether information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;downloaded is a choice that now lies with the downloader.
</em><br>
<p><p>Same old excuses for theft.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There are various things that can be done about the probable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decrease in artist revenues.  Eliminating middlemen will increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the amount that goes to artists.  For those who are willing to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effort into this, I think the most leveraged approach is to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tipping infrastructures, with tips going directly to the artists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;despite the screams this will cause by the RIAA and MPAA.  But in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the long run, even that is doomed.  Content that doesn't request
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tips will drive out content that requests tips.  I don't download
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shareware anymore because there's almost always an entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free alternative at CNET downloads.  I don't know that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decreases the quality of software, but my guess is that it does -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;although open-source may make up for that, and too little time has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;passed to tell in any case, and it was just a guess to begin with.
</em><br>
<p>You left out another option, the affected artists can bring legal
<br>
action against those responsible for theft. Difficult or not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But the age of downloading is here, regardless.
</em><br>
<p>So apparently is the age of theft.
