<p><em>&gt; &quot;don't pay politicians&quot;? Good idea!! How do you propose to evade paying taxes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which are used to pay politicians)? As for entangling alliances... I guess
</em><br>
<p>1) Lobby like hell to protect online privacy, crypto and anonymity. Support
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the EFF and the ACLU.
<br>
2) If you code and have spare time, support the efforts of various groups
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing and testing e-cash and crypto software.
<br>
3) Open an account with E-Gold or a similar company, and use this account
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at every opportunity. BUT AVOID THOSE DAMN NAZI SELLOUTS AT PAYPAL. IMO.
<br>
4) Whenever possible, buy stuff you need through auction sites. This helps
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individuals and small businesses and gets you a better deal.
<br>
5) Look into establishing an offshore bank account. For less than a grand,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can get a checking account and a pre-paid Visa or Mastercard debit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;card (last I checked), so you'll be buying privacy without sacrificing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the convenience.
<br>
6) Vote Libertarian. Especially in local elections. Join your local
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Libertarian chapter.
<br>
7) Adopt a smart but uninformed person who seems interested in this stuff
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and show them how to use computers, how to protect their privacy, etc.
<br>
8) Come up with ideas to disintermediate authority and refine these ideas
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with members of your favorite think tank.
<br>
9) Above all, remember that government is not a fact of life, not a force
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of nature, just another institution that we built, and that we will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dismantle once it has completely outlived its usefulness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; they go with the territory, no matter where the territory is, and no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how small the territory. Office politics infect even small businesses.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have a problem with alliances or politics. I have a problem with
<br>
incompetent policies being decided in secret supposedly on my behalf but
<br>
really benefitting entities I don't give a damn about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Granted, but as a tax payer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There you go... you're paying politicians.
</em><br>
<p>Grr. Don't remind me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm forced to foot part of this cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; regardless of how many petroleum products I actually consume.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you buy petroleum products, you pay the extra excise tax collected at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pump or point of sale.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps this tax should be increased until it reflects the actual
<br>
costs of the services the US armed forces provide to oil
<br>
companies. Why should people who walk to work subsidize other people's
<br>
fuel? Furthermore, such a tax will increase the economic incentive for
<br>
developing alternative energy sources, thus obsoleting yet another lot
<br>
of porkbarrel projects. TANSTAAFL.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with government, but then, in the US the government and industry are savvy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to know that they are two sides of the same coin, and that coin means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic stability.
</em><br>
<p>Except they're working with imperfect information just like everybody
<br>
else, and in fact causing political and economic instability. CF:

<p><em>&gt; &gt; As a thought experiment, what if we just stopped having a foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; policy for a decade or so?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, you mean like re-instate the Clinton administration? ©¿©¬
</em><br>
<p>??? In what sense was the Clinton administration non-interventionist?!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, that sounds good to me, but the US government wouldn't go for it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it would mean that a huge part of government would be out of jobs, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequently the liberals (aka, socialists) wouldn't go for it because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would reduce the size of government, which is something they want to avoid.
</em><br>
<p>Liberals and conservatives both, these days. Notice how you haven't been
<br>
hearing any 'big government' rhetoric from the right lately? They only
<br>
favor less pork when they're the piggies furthest away from the feeding
<br>
trough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Better yet, just say: The only good Wahhabi is a dead Wahhabi.
</em><br>
<p>No, because then I'll sound like an ignorant, trigger-happy
<br>
redneck. It's important to me that I am recognized for the
<br>
cosmopolitan, post-modern, educated, trigger-happy redneck that I am.
