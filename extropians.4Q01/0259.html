<em>&gt; &gt;### Just for the sake of philosophical hair-splitting - murdering

<em>&gt; &gt;innocent civilians is definitely evil, but not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;cowardly, and in some legal systems is not even criminal. If you

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem isn't your philosophical system, it's mine, and in mine

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These acts took place within the borders of the continental U.S.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and by our standards and laws they are both cowardly and criminal.
</em><br>
<p>But by our standards, when the CIA with little or no oversight
<br>
and using secret funds goes to various countries and topples
<br>
their elected governments using a variety of means including
<br>
those which cannot be termed other than terrorism, torture,
<br>
assasination, sabotage and so on - is this somehow not criminal
<br>
but a reasonable function of the government?
<br>
<p>It seems to me there is a bit of a double standard here.  As bad
<br>
as WTC was we have been involved in covert operations in
<br>
countries we were not at war with, even in countries we were
<br>
supposedly friends with that are every bit as horrendous.  Some
<br>
of our secret operations resulted in much higher loss of life
<br>
and property.  Does it enter into anyone's head along with
<br>
chest-beating righteous anger that some of the anger and venom
<br>
directed toward us is not without cause?  Do we understand that
<br>
our rhetoric is roundly condemning as utterly beyond the pall
<br>
actions that portions of our own government have committed, are
<br>
committing and plan now to commit even more egregiously?  Some
<br>
of what is proposed as curative would include a variety of even
<br>
more ambitious covert activities around the world and even
<br>
within our own borders by some of these same players and any
<br>
undesirables they may see fit to influence, use or recruit. 
<br>
Have we learned a damn thing from the history of using such
<br>
methods?  Does anything seem a bit cockeyed about this sort of
<br>
&quot;solution&quot;?
