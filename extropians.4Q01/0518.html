(...still largely skimming the list, so forgive me if this doesn't quite
<br>
&quot;fit&quot; ...)
<br>
<p>I think there's a lot to this idea -- that robotics, AI, VR and advanced
<br>
nano could in essence create a &quot;magical&quot; world once imagined by our
<br>
ancestors (and unfortunately still fervently believed in by the majority of
<br>
humanity).  One &quot;legal&quot; take on this idea that's occurred to me before (and
<br>
that I think I've mentioned here before):
<br>
<p>One of the primary sources of modern Western law is Roman culture.  Roman
<br>
law, while quite rational and systematic in its development, was based on a
<br>
deep foundation of mythic belief.  Looking at its early substance and
<br>
practice, we see no sharp dividing line between what we would call today
<br>
&quot;law&quot; and what we would see now as religion and superstition.  One small
<br>
example that has struck me as resonant with this concept of a world
<br>
&quot;animated&quot; with high technology is the ritual and legal procedure for
<br>
conveyance of real property.  In Roman legal practice an essential element
<br>
of a proper conveyance was joint communication by the seller and buyer with
<br>
the boundary gods or &quot;terminii&quot; of the piece of land involved.  The parties
<br>
to the contract would ritually communicate their desire to transfer
<br>
ownership to the terminii, so that they would thereafter perform their
<br>
magical functions on behalf of the new owner.
<br>
<p>I can see a similar practice and mentality developing with regard to &quot;smart
<br>
property&quot; (see Nick Szabo's development of this idea for newcomers here).  A
<br>
piece of smart property that would have within it both the intelligence and
<br>
effective means to know and enforce property rights would also have to be
<br>
&quot;propitiated&quot; in any transfer of ownership or even temporary rightful
<br>
possession.  In some important respects, this would be indistinguishable
<br>
from the Ur-law of Rome.
<br>
<p>Clarke's Third Law, indeed . . .
