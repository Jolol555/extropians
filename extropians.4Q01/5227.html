<em>&gt;This seems to have been historical fact, as the term is used. However, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  observe the Japanese economy over the last 11 years, their economic bubble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has burst. So, do  you sense that this is because of their united
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;concept?
</em><br>
<p>Personally, I think it is a case of them overextending themselves as well 
<br>
as dumping, which costs them for every item sold. The stock market built up 
<br>
the values of some companies beyond reasonable levels, and things just 
<br>
finally leveled out again. Being basically Libertarian, I like to believe 
<br>
that a large part of the bursting bubble was due to their own government's 
<br>
&quot;aid&quot; backfiring at last.
<br>
<p>The biggest problem with the Japanese' market tactics is not only that we 
<br>
lost so much of our infrastructure in high-tech fields when American 
<br>
companies went under - as has been pointed out - but we are now terribly 
<br>
dependent on foreign firms for parts for our own industries. Too often, 
<br>
companies discontinue parts used mostly by American firms, thus 
<br>
hamstringing production. Not to be too chauvinistic about it - our own 
<br>
Motorola's semiconductor group is famous for killing off single-sourced 
<br>
parts after getting businesses to design them into their products.
<br>
<p>I think an ongoing problem with businesses is the process of forecasting 
<br>
eternal growth of the market. Expecting 5% to 10% growth is not reasonable 
<br>
in many markets, once the saturation level is reached. For example, cell 
<br>
phones - the marketers now have to push different colors and styles, rather 
<br>
than new features, because almost everyone who wants one already has one. 
<br>
Plants built on the prediction of an endless demand are now being shuttered 
<br>
and the workers laid off. This kind of effect may have been part of the 
<br>
Japanese collapse.
