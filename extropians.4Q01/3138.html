James' post about Leon Kass prompts me to make some general comments about
<br>
the recent controversy here over Samantha Atkins' postings about the
<br>
Afghanistan War and John Clark's responses to them.
<br>
First, my usual disclaimer regarding my own personal list participation.
<br>
Since 911 I've been preoccupied with matters that have taken me away from
<br>
writing here.  Because of the international nature of my work, the terrorist
<br>
attacks had a direct impact on my daily life that I am only now getting
<br>
under control.  The main U.S. office of one of my largest clients was
<br>
destroyed in the attack.  (Fortunately, all of the people in the office got
<br>
out of the WTC alive, since they were on the 48th floor of the first tower
<br>
and the head of the office had the good sense to tell his people to get the
<br>
hell out immediately, without regard for the important and sensitive records
<br>
that were left behind and all lost.)  Carefully laid plans for the work I
<br>
was to be doing for the rest of this year were undermined and had to be
<br>
rethought and new plans set in motion.  Beyond that, the attacks had a deep
<br>
intellectual and emotional impact on me.  As I've mentioned briefly here
<br>
since, I embarked on a course of Islamic studies that is by no means
<br>
finished.  I've also spent more time since 911 doing things that just make
<br>
me feel better - spending time with my wife and friends, doing art work,
<br>
going to the theater, playing music - because the violence and irrationality
<br>
of the attacks have made me realize more than ever how important it is to
<br>
balance &quot;work&quot; with play, and ambition with love.
<br>
<p>Second, thanks to James for posting the article about Leon Kass.  It points
<br>
up the danger threatened by irrationalities other than Islamic
<br>
fundamentalism, an ironically welcome change for me from worrying about the
<br>
dangers originating in the Middle East.
<br>
<p>Finally, some specific comments about the &quot;Atkins/Clark War&quot;.  I have to
<br>
begin, as others have, by saying that I agree with John and disagree with
<br>
Samantha on almost every specific point that's been raised.  As a life-long
<br>
student of military history, I believe it is simply wrong to say, as
<br>
Samantha has, that the United States has &quot;attacked Afghanistan&quot;.  Far, far
<br>
more than any other military establishment in history, the current U.S.
<br>
armed forces are animated by a deep and broad value of avoiding civilian
<br>
casualties wherever possible, demand extremely clear-cut war aims and
<br>
operate in a general political environment in which the use of violence is
<br>
prescribed as narrowly as possible.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, I understand both the intellectual and visceral repugnance John
<br>
has expressed at the criticism of the current U.S. policy Samantha has made.
<br>
If there were ever to be a situation that would justify the use of force in
<br>
response to provocation, it is the 911 attacks.  Action taken to firmly
<br>
break al Quaida, its ideological fellow-travelers and the nation states that
<br>
support them is, to me, a defense of civilization.  Failure to act
<br>
decisively - and yes, violently - at this juncture would be a confession of
<br>
weakness in our civilization, a lack of confidence in our own identity as a
<br>
culture that would be tantamount to collective suicide.
<br>
<p>Because of the strength of my feelings and the to me overwhelming logic of
<br>
these conclusions, it is difficult to tolerate repeated references to the
<br>
past sins of U.S. foreign policy, great as they may have been.  Being in the
<br>
business of conflict myself, I know that the moment of maximum battle is no
<br>
time to undermine resolve with doubts: That is an exercise for prior
<br>
consideration and debate and the weighty job of assigning credit and blame
<br>
after the fact.  And, with a few notable and important exceptions, I believe
<br>
that the United States does a better job today than in the past of both the
<br>
tasks of prior consideration of its foreign policy values and the work of
<br>
self-criticism after the fact.  The U.S. exercised restraint in imperial
<br>
triumph in the Gulf War, engaged its military might in Haiti and the Balkans
<br>
with almost dainty impact and has generally been infused with a greater
<br>
element of self-criticism and self-doubt in the last thirty years than any
<br>
other imperial power in history.
<br>
<p>With all that said, though, I have to agree that John's rhetoric has been
<br>
over the line.  The simple fact is that the minimal governance of this list
<br>
requires that a line be drawn at personal attacks.  Making distinctions when
<br>
the subject of discussion is one about which people have very strong
<br>
feelings is a difficult task.  Is it wrong to call Samantha &quot;an idiot&quot;, but
<br>
OK to call Jeremy Rifkin &quot;a dangerous moron&quot; (as I have)?  I have to say
<br>
&quot;yes&quot;, and this is why: Samantha is a list subscriber and regular poster and
<br>
Rifkin is not.
<br>
<p>So that it's clear, I have to say that I actually agree with John that some
<br>
of the views at least implicitly expressed by Samantha are actually
<br>
dangerous, in the sense that their widespread adoption would significantly
<br>
undermine the security of those who work to implement the transhumanist
<br>
agenda.  Furthermore, although I have only been skimming the list these last
<br>
couple of months, I FEEL (based on that brief skimming) that Samantha may
<br>
have been lighting a few rhetorical matches in the gasoline-soaked
<br>
environment of inflammatory feelings in the aftermath of the attacks.
<br>
However, it is important to note that she is not alone in her thoughts and
<br>
also that she shares many of the same goals and values held by people who
<br>
disagree with her on the matters at issue recently.  It seems to me to be
<br>
more important to encourage open and civil debate so that we can all
<br>
understand each other better, than to simply vent personal frustration or
<br>
even repugnance, tempting though it may be to do so.  Observing a
<br>
prohibition against personal attacks best encourages such debate.
<br>
<p>A final note: bear in mind that it is more infuriating to hear someone with
<br>
whom you share at least some values and goals and who you otherwise like and
<br>
respect express opinions with which you strongly disagree than it is to hear
<br>
the same opinions expressed by someone with whom you share nothing or for
<br>
whom you have no affection or respect.  I will give a personal example:
<br>
Since 911 I have found the postings on the subject of Islamist terrorism and
<br>
the US response that Amara has made to be wrong in some basic ways.  Amara
<br>
is someone whom I have admired from afar for a long time and who I was very
<br>
pleased to finally meet in person at Extro5.  She turned out to be just as
<br>
intelligent and charming as I had imagined, and my admiration for her soared
<br>
even higher.  Yet I have felt that her opinions about Islam and the general
<br>
subject of how the civilized world should respond to the Islamist threat
<br>
were wrong in ways that it was difficult for me to fathom.  I confess to
<br>
being literally angry when I read some of the things she wrote.  Why?
<br>
Because I couldn't understand how someone who was so intelligent could be so
<br>
mistaken about something that seemed so clear to me.  In such a situation
<br>
restraint is a greater virtue than it would be with someone for whom I feel
<br>
no respect: It is all the more important to maintain civility.
<br>
<p>So I end with a plea that each list subscriber take the responsibility to
<br>
maintain a general atmosphere of civility here.
