This all takes me back... much &quot;study&quot; (ie: harrassment) of ants when I was
<br>
a little tucker.
<br>
<p>It also raises a couple of questions...
<br>
<p>1 - Why do hive insects care if there is more than one queen? She doesn't
<br>
seem to exert centralised control, so what's the big deal? Does she release
<br>
signal hormones or something like that, which require atomicity?
<br>
<p>2 - How do hive insects evolve??? The genes involved in reproduction seem to
<br>
come from the queen &amp; drones, who are far removed from the survival of the
<br>
hive. 
<br>
<p>I would guess that drones must evolve to be better at mating with the queen,
<br>
but the rest of it is a bit trickier. Are whole colonies analogous to a
<br>
single organism in terms of reproductive fitness? If so, then we have the
<br>
case that colonies are actually asexual reproducers, in that they split to
<br>
reproduce; two colonies do not combine their DNA to form an offspring. 
<br>
<p>So, if the colony's reproduction is actually the splitting of the colony,
<br>
then the production of individual insects is more akin to the creation of
<br>
new cells in a human body, and plays the same role in terms of reproduction
<br>
of the colony; that is, not much of a role at all.
<br>
<p>The colony would have a lifespan, or generation time, anyway, on the order
<br>
of large animals, not on the order of non-colony insect generation times.
<br>
How do they compete with insects which evolve far more quickly? Does the
<br>
colony organisation put them out of direct competition with other insects,
<br>
and into the same kind of space as larger animals???
<br>
<p>Any comments appreciated!!

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi Spike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I love to watch ants too, and have seen this before. When I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a kid we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had a large nest of meat-ants (dunno their proper name -- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about half an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inch long with red body and black abdomen) near the house 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which we used as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a garbage disposal for all the things that the dog, the local 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wild birds, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the fish didn't want or couldn't eat. This colony grew 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and grew. I used 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to very carefully squat on the edge of the enormous mound and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watch the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little critters for hours. It always amazed me that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never tried to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One day I was walking down the long bush path to the house 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I noticed a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trail of ants with exactly the qualities you mention. They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had cleared a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highway in the undergrowth -- astonishing in itself. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed the path 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both ways -- to its source and its destination. The source was the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enormous, well-fed colony near the house. The destination was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a spot some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred yards away (maybe less). Initially I thought they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were migrating, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I realised after the traffic had dwindled and eventually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stopped that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the colony had split.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have often wondered what determined which ants went to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which colony. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume the move was triggered by the colony reaching critical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass and some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hormonal trigger causing the split. I wonder if the new queen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was produced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before or after the migration. I don't think ants are as ummm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antsy about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having more than one queen as bees or wasps are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The complex behavior that ants are capable of in groups is quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enthralling. I wonder how much analogy can be drawn between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group behavior 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in humans and in social insects. Craig Reynolds' classic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flocking behavior 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires only 3 simple rules:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   - Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   - Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   - Cohesion: steer to move toward the average position of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local flockmates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can see them at work in any crowd of people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ants have similar simple rules that govern apparently complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some work by Chris Langton has uncovered some of these. Craig 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reynolds has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also worked on them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you like ants, you should see our bull-ants. They are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largest ants 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the world -- about an inch long. They have quite small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonies of less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a thousand individuals I believe. There are smaller 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variants, about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3/4 of an inch, commonly called bulldog ants which are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerably more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ferocious than the larger ones. Bulldog ants will actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chase and jump 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at you. All kinds of bull-ants have very painful stings. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been stung 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so many times I hardly get any reaction now apart from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial pain and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later furious itch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My 2 brothers once watched an army of bulldog ants surround 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and take a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; termite mound in all-out war. Wish I had seen that. How the hell they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coordinate such maneuvers boggles the mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Happy ant-watching.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best wishes,
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;Today I witnessed something that is baffling the hell outta

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;something today that I have never seen before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;When one sees an ant trail, one always sees ants going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;both directions, nearly balanced, so that the net ant flux is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;approximately zero.  Those who have been to my house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;know that I have an integral garden {because it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;raised area with a curved wall shaped like an integral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;sign} and an eliptical grass area, golden ratio ellipse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I saw an ant trail going from the integral garden to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the ellipse *with a definite direction*.  The ant trail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;had a very high one way flux, perhaps as high as 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ants per second, with only an occasional wanderer going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;back the other way.  This was an ant colony that had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;suddenly just decided to *move* somewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I saw no obvious food source in the grassy ellipse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I searched but found no reason why the integral garden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;had suddenly become the place not to be.  No sprinklers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;had come on, no chemicals were released.  I noticed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;many of the ants were carrying eggs.  None of the few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;backtrackers had eggs, whereas about a third of the forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;movers had eggs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Another thing about ant lines is that they do not change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;suddenly.  This one did.  Over a period of about 15
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;minutes, the ant flux declined from about 10 per second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to nearly zero: the backtrackers remained constant while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the forward goers quickly dropped to about the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the backtrackers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This was a clear case of a colony moving somewhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;but what I dont understand is why, and why now exactly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and how do they signal everybody to grab an egg and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;walk this way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Can anyone suggest how to make an instrument which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would watch an ant trail and measure flux?  I need something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I can connect to a computer so it can watch all the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;while I go to work.  spike
