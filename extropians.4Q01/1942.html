</em><br>
<p>Not being a supporter of democracy myself, I don't see the point of
<br>
supporting oligarchies or military dictatorships either.  Again, the US
<br>
government should just disengage...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, I don't want a democracy in Egypt or Saudi Arabia or Pakistan and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps not even in Iraq because however unsavory the dictators of those
</em><br>
countries
<br>

</em><br>
religious zealots
<br>
<em>&gt; aiming at martyrdom.
</em><br>
<p>The regimes in Egypt and Saudi Arabia helped to make al Qaeda possible.
<br>
Most of its members and its leadership are from -- you guessed it! -- these
<br>
two countries.  In fact, one of the best kept secrets -- from the American
<br>
people -- is that Egypt creates some of the most militant terrorists in the
<br>
whole region.
<br>
<p>Also, the Pakistani government -- of course, after the coup it's much the
<br>
same -- helped to put and keep the Taleban in power!
<br>
<p>The pattern has been repeated.  If you ignore Jimm Carter's cry not to look
<br>
at &quot;ancient history&quot; -- in other words the 25 years before the Islamic
<br>
Revolution of '79 -- you'll see that the US support of the Shah of Iran
<br>
helped him to [unwittingly] radicalize the Muslim population there.  Surely,
<br>
neither the Shah nor his US supporters intended this, but his repressive
<br>
policies basically destroyed the Iranian middle class and what hope there
<br>
was from the 1950s to 1979 for a secular, open society.  (Today, Iran is
<br>
starting to move back in that direction.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; do you think the CIA was prohibited from being in the assasination
</em><br>
business
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in 1981 for no reason at all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fortunately it looks like the CIA will soon get back into the
</em><br>
assassination business,
<br>
<em>&gt; we all know who number one on the target list will be.
</em><br>
<p>And it's about time!  Once such assassinations begin, hopefully, war will
<br>
turn into leaders being killed -- as opposed to civilians or drafted
<br>
soldiers.  If war returns to being a specialized affair of the elites, then
<br>
the masses will, hopefully, turn away from it and we can approximate and
<br>
hopefully improve on the the pre-Napoleonic view of war as just the affair
<br>
of kings -- and not of whole societies against one another.
<br>
<p>Pax!
