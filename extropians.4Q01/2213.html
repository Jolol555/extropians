an angry dog? It will try different escapes and escape strategies. The

perhaps less behavioral flexibility.

</em><br>
<p>OK, this is a reasonable position I can agree with. An increased risk
<br>
is handled by adding a commensurate safeguard. But I don't see *why*
<br>
you soften your initial position here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;However, the commision of murder(=killing of an innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;self-aware entity against its wishes) or even a verifiable willingness to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;commit murder, is reason enough to lose the right to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you were an anti-abortionist this would be a great argument for killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abortion doctors and pro-abortion people, wouldn't it? The biggest danger of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your argument is that it can be interpreted so broadly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ####  Anti-abortionnists do not define murder as I do - they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epistemological difficulties leading them to erroneously conclude that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embryos have human rights. So, their ethics might be unimpeachable (they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to kill those who initiate violence against defenseless children) but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their knowledge of the world is poor, therefore they make wrong decisions. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think that my basic argument can be abused any more than other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles. After all, &quot;striking back&quot; can also be very broadly interpreted.
</em><br>
<p>The problem here is that it might not just be epistemological
<br>
differences, but simply a different definition of human.
<br>
<p>I once met a girl who greeted me with &quot;Hi, murderer&quot;. She had heard of
<br>
my interest in uploading, and considered it murder since at the end of
<br>
the process you end up with a disassembled (dead) human and a non-human
<br>
simulacrum. A consistent position I disagree with, but understand. But
<br>
if she subscribed to your view of when it is allowed to initiate force,
<br>
she would not just be right in killing me when I tried to upload
<br>
someone, but also in killing me *now* because I would gladly upload a
<br>
willing test subject if it was possible - and hence show my disregard of
<br>
(deluded) human life from her position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This goes far beyond merely being allowed to strike back at somebody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiating force against you, since it also allows you to make pre-emptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strikes against people judged (by whom?) as *potentially* able to initiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a terrible danger in making rights contingent on mental states that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be checked, rather than based on actual behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### You are entirely correct - however, the problem you are pointing to is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an ethical issue per se - it is much more of a problem with having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited knowledge of mental states. Presently we have only very unreliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools for predicting somebody's likelihood for sociopathic behavior but in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future you might be able to  predict with a great degree of certainty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the person sitting next to you in the cafeteria would immediately kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you if you were defenseless, had no social structure to protect you and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could take your breakfast. The least you would need to do would be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent ever being at the mercy of such a person (never let him join the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police, run for office).
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. And it might be reasonable to try to get the person treated or
<br>
supervised. But if you attack him without him attacking you first, he
<br>
would have a moral right of defend himself regardless of how twisted he
<br>
was. 
<br>
<p>The problem is that some information is subjective to a degree that no
<br>
amount of brain scan can give it to us. If we have different
<br>
philosophical views of what it means to be a human, then we might want
<br>
to kill each other as being clear menaces to human life but a judge
<br>
could not do anything other than rule on what definition of humanity the
<br>
legal system accepts - none of us can ever be shown wrong. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   Beside the obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slippery slope of making other, less central rights (such as freedom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property) also contingent on having the right thoughts and beliefs *as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by others*, revoking the right to live now depends on a judgement of mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability which is quite subjective, easily affected by prejudices and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest and in general hard to control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### These are important arguments, especially the self-interest one, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, they are valid only if our methods of predicting human behavior are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective - if you can run a virtual reality test on a person (with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person being unaware of the simulation), and he repeatedly shows objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a disregard for the life of others (will almost always kill an elderly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple in an expensive car, stranded on a highway at night, just to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ride in the car) then the answers are much less subjective. His beliefs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not so important as is his willingness to kill innocent persons, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revokes his own right to live. If you kill in VR, you might kill in RR, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's OK to kill you for real.
</em><br>
<p>Aha, so all the players of Quake and Doom should be executed? OK, they
<br>
knew it was a simulation. But what about the killers who actually think
<br>
*this* world is a simulation? They are wrong, but ethically it is not
<br>
obvious they are different from the Quake players. 
<br>
<p>Detecting potential killers this way is a great idea - but I think
<br>
killing people for a virtual action (even if they thought it was real)
<br>
is not just excessive but immoral. No crime has been comitted: I view
<br>
crimes as bad things actually done to another being with rights, not
<br>
just a one-sided action - it is an interaction between two ethical
<br>
subjects. When you punish (severely) non-crimes, the whole scale of
<br>
justice tilts. 
<br>
<p>The greatest risk is that your right to life is suddenly entirely in the
<br>
hands of the government (or whoever runs the testing). What happens when
<br>
a mistake is done, or some malicious person(s) forge data? You can never
<br>
appeal if you are dead.
<br>
<p>A deeper problem is that when you start to take away the most valuable thing
<br>
there is - life - then there is less resistance to take away other
<br>
valuable things.  If people can't make informed political decisions, why
<br>
allow them to vote? People who can't manage their economy, shouldn't
<br>
more competent people take their money and use it wisely on their
<br>
behalf? If you think so, maybe you should move to us in Sweden ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A society where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to life is not universal and can be revoked not just for actions but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because your *thinking* violates certain standards sounds like an extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #### By the way, correct me if I am wrong, you agree that the right to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be revoked for actions, right?
</em><br>
<p>Only for initiation of force, and even then only to a minimal extent. I
<br>
do not, for example, believe that executions are ethically acceptable.
