<p>This is a key point.  At the times when I'm struggling to come to grips
<br>
with something that Eric or Robert Freitas has written, I really feel
<br>
this is true.  The fact that it has taken ~20 years for more than
<br>
a handful of serious scientists to catch up with Eric's insights
<br>
(or 40 years to catch up with Feynman's) *really* points out the
<br>
degree to which standing just a little bit above the crowd allows
<br>
you to see forever.
<br>
<p>More importantly, we now seem to have some empirical evidence that
<br>
intelligence is not a simple linear scale.  A couple of British
<br>
mathematicians seem to have shown that a relatively small increase
<br>
in &quot;capacity&quot; buys a *lot* in terms of &quot;effective&quot; intelligence.
<br>
<p>Here is a *really* poor news summary from Wired News:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,48576,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,48576,00.html</a>
<br>
<p>One can hope that someone more qualified to comment on the
<br>
results will publish something a bit clearer about the methods.
<br>
(Perhaps someone can find something in the preprint archives...)
<br>
<p>But it tends to support Damien's point.  I would propose a corollary --
<br>
If you cannot hold the enormity of the problem in ones consciousness
<br>
then developing effective solutions is *really* difficult.
<br>
<p>Some examples that come to mind are the 4-color Map Theorem,
<br>
Fermat's Last Theorem, and of course what would be the most
<br>
extropic U.S. Foreign Policy.
