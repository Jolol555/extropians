</em><br>
<p>Depends on the market value of a vote. When news coverage starts being
<br>
more rightly regarded as campaign contributions (considering how biased
<br>
most news coverage is), I'll start thinking more about campaign reform.
<br>
As it is, Time-Warner/AOL owns CNN, TBS, and the rest of the Turner
<br>
broadcasting empire. So, they not only get to outspend me, they get to
<br>
tell me from an alleged 'objective' press platform that the groups I
<br>
support like the NRA are 'special interests' while their editorial
<br>
decisions are not. They also get to donate many millions to causes which
<br>
oppose my Constitutional civil liberties, yet claim that my group is
<br>
nothing but a paid hack for the gun manufacturing industry.
<br>
<p>The fact is that there are far more of us than there are of them. The
<br>
NRA, which generates a smaller percentage of its revinues from industry
<br>
than any other major advocacy group in DC, (including the AARP) yet is
<br>
regarded by lawmakers and the lobbying industry as the most effective
<br>
CITIZENS advocacy group (and most effective group in general). A lack of
<br>
endorsement by the NRA is regarded as a potential death knell to
<br>
campaigns in most of the country, specifically because it has over 3
<br>
million paying members and represents a constituency of gun owners that
<br>
is a supermajority of the voting public (whether they think it
<br>
represents them or not). NRA anti-candidate campaigns kill more
<br>
candidacies than any other group.
<br>
<p>Yet the media, owned by big corporations, continues to portray the NRA
<br>
as a 'fringe' group of 'extremists' and 'industry' special interests.
<br>
<p>Why is it then that most groups who espouse an anti-coporate agenda are
<br>
also opposed to the NRA? It is important to understand this sort of
<br>
dynamic, because a similar problem exists with extropy. Most of our
<br>
positions are opposed by both the corporate/government world and by
<br>
those groups that oppose them, despite the fact that extropic ideas
<br>
resonate on an individual basis to varying degrees with most people.
<br>
<p>The NRA is effective because it has &quot;God&quot; on its side politically: The
<br>
Constitution says the NRA is right, in terms that are easy to understand
<br>
for most people. The term &quot;The right of the people to keep and bear arms
<br>
shall not be infringed&quot; is extremely easy for the average dope to
<br>
comprehend. They don't need a lawyer or law maker or judge to tell them
<br>
what that means. There isn't more than two two syllable words in there,
<br>
and no terms that are not ordinary speech.
<br>
<p>For extropy, I think the best thing we can do on the political front is
<br>
to find similar language and grab onto it. Claim it as our own, that
<br>
only we can truly defend the people's interests in it, etc. This
<br>
establishes our cause as having a tradition worth defending, one that
<br>
every person has an interest in.
<br>
<p>I think that this is inevitable. Politics doesn't work at all well on
<br>
the &quot;I am an army of one&quot; philosophy.
