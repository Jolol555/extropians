</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the filter of &quot;who can you *trust*&quot;.  I don't really have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any good ideas as to how you would do that unfortunately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We do have concrete evidence that immigrants from Arab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries have a negative trust quotient while immigrants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Canada or Mexico would seem to have a positive trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quotient.  While I hate to say it due to its political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncorrectness should we not use that evidence to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves?
</em><br>
<p>I think that we might develop some handicaps based on national origin,
<br>
but these should not be applied in all cases. For example, some of the
<br>
hardest working and most productive, loyal and patriotic people I know
<br>
came to this country as refugees from countries that have poor respect
<br>
for markets, democracy, and individual liberties. More properly, perhaps
<br>
a series of personality tests could be mandated for permanent residents
<br>
and those seeking citizenship, to test each individual on their own
<br>
merits rather than biasing against them because the rest of their
<br>
countrymen are bad people.
<br>
<p>Today, we do try to prevent those with criminal records, for example,
<br>
from coming into the country, but this of course depends on the
<br>
cooperation of the government of their home country to be honest. This
<br>
tends to work, and we do have automatic flags pop up for extra scrutiny
<br>
of those coming from certain countries like Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon,
<br>
Syria, etc. who have a record of supporting terrorism.
<br>
<p>So here are some ideas:
<br>
a) those claiming refugee status are treated differently than
<br>
opportunity immigrants, in that they only have personality tests to
<br>
detect moles. They get free ESL and history/political science courses.
<br>
b) opportunity immigrants (relatives, employment, wealth, etc) are
<br>
handicapped by their country of origin and are subject to personality
<br>
tests as well as citizenship requirements (public service or military
<br>
service, history and political courses, and possibly even ESL (they pay
<br>
for their own tests and coursework)).
<br>
c) temporary visitors get an international background check (Interpol as
<br>
well as their countries of birth and origin), must provide a letter of
<br>
invitation from a US citizen that is notarized by a city or court clerk,
<br>
and we scale back the list of 24 countries that get visa exemptions.
<br>
d) all visitors and immigrants are equipped at the border/customs
<br>
station with a wrist transponder like those used by electronic home
<br>
detention systems, only these work via satellite (GPS and satphone) to
<br>
help law enforcement locate each immigrant/visitor. Immigrants can have
<br>
the unit removed when they attain citizenship. Visitors who have visited
<br>
the US at least once per year for ten years are not required to wear the
<br>
transponder.
<br>
<p>Outside of these requirements, I'd let the door open, no quotas except
<br>
for some countries that have poor trust handicaps.
