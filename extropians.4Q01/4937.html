By &quot;banning mockery&quot; I do not mean outlawing it, but overreacting to
<br>
it and denying its suitability as a debating technique. I believe that
<br>
sometimes mockery can be a good way to point to the fact that others
<br>
carry an idea, even a valid one, too far. The original post by Mark,
<br>
as a read it, is a joke pointing to the fact that some worship the
<br>
free market as a deity rather than seeing it as a good tool, a very
<br>
good one, that can still be improved by analysis and practice. The
<br>
reply by E. Shaun, and yours, sound like you feel offended by the fact
<br>
that blasphemous non-believers dare mocking the Free Market God. So
<br>
you &quot;fall in the trap&quot; and give even more force to the first argument
<br>
(the joke). I think the free market deserves a better defence. Please
<br>
correct me if I misinterpreted any of the posts I refer to.

</em><br>
<p>You are right, and I apologize to E. Shaun. I will follow your advice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The rest of your comments were inappropriately tagged as being E. Shaun's, though his were at the bottom and

<em>&gt;double-&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;'d. Please consider more careful proofreading of your posts.
</em><br>
<p>Now I am a bit lost since I am unable to identify the sarcasm you are
<br>
referring to. Perhaps you could point it to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;OK, and this hope for more F is helped precisely _how_ by sarcasm? Is sarcasm &quot;analysis&quot;?
