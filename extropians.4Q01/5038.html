<p>Amen to the above paragraph.
<br>
<p>I find identification with states and races utterly boring and
<br>
retrograde.  I cringe whenever I see the pronoun &quot;us&quot; used to refer
<br>
to the US government, the West, white males or the like.  In the
<br>
early years of this list (a decade ago!?) the state was something
<br>
to be smashed, or at least completely avoided, and race, sex, and
<br>
sexual orientation were annoying baggage that could and should be
<br>
thrown off ASAP.  We were racial/ethnic mongrels already, and sex
<br>
would be infinitely mutable with transhuman technology, so what of
<br>
it?
<br>
<p>Now I see attempts to think outside millenia-old collectivist
<br>
debates scoffed at as unrealistic.  Depends upon one's perspective.
<br>
Eliezer's right, from another perspective these debates seem absurd.
<br>
<p>Next time you're worked up about supposed threats to the homeland,
<br>
&quot;western&quot; values, or competition between your very distant relative
<br>
and your slightly more very distant relative, do one of the following
<br>
or invent your own:
<br>
* Go outside, look at the stars
<br>
* Look at something under a microscope
<br>
* Create and/or learn something new
<br>
