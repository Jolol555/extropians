</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 1)  The US intervention in Afghanistan is doing more harm than good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why they don't drop ONLY food bombs ,and let afghans access net to say by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own??
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that it's doing more harm than good.  Neither do the Afghan
<br>
people dancing in the streets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2)  A superior strategy for the US would have been to turn the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cheek, thus gaining moral superiority and showing the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we don't always bomb people we don't like.
</em><br>
<p>We tried that the last time the trade center was attacked.  The taliban just
<br>
tried again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3)  The number of dead Afghan civilians has vastly exceeded the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of dead American civilians, and this puts the US in the wrong.
</em><br>
<p>You must be listening to different numbers than I am.  Who is claiming that
<br>
we have killed over 6,000 people with our bombs?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and - with the technology involved? bombs? strange actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is USA poor or rich? or simply - bandites!
</em><br>
<p>I don't see your point.  We're rich?  So?  Are you saying that there is a
<br>
more humane way to wage war and we aren't using it because of cost?  I doubt
<br>
it.  Fighter jets with precision aimed bombs are VERY expensive, and very
<br>
humane.  We don't have to (and aren't) carpet bombing the whole country.
<br>
We're just bombing the Taliban strongholds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 6)  Bin Laden may not have had just cause to blow up the World Trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Center, but a lot of Middle East citizens have reason to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty annoyed at the US - perhaps more reason to be annoyed at the US
</em><br>
than the US has
<br>
<em>&gt; reason to be annoyed at Bin Laden.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  That's why we are bombing the Taliban and not the entire Middle
<br>
East.  We are not bombing people because they hate us.  We are bombing
<br>
people who bombed us first, so that they won't bomb us again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bin laden could drop Biological-Bomb instead of ONLY crashing WTC.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i think Bin Laden was VERY polite!
</em><br>
<p>Actually, he was just stopped.  Don't you recall the guy trying to smuggle
<br>
anthrax into Washington state from Canada?  Haven't you heard of our foiling
<br>
weapons grade arms sales to the Taliban?  It's not Bin Laden being polite,
<br>
it's the US preventing him from using his weapons.  When all is said and
<br>
done, what the terrorists did, they did with box-cutters because they
<br>
couldn't sneak in anything more lethal.  It has NOTHING to do with
<br>
politeness.
