</em><br>
<em>&gt; the man with a condition called Capgras Delusion. He knew who and where he
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward his parents, he concluded that they were lying look-alikes. (Reminder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to uploaders: Don't forget to include the enteric nervous system.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another file concerned John, who has temporal lobe epilepsy, and his seizures

<em>&gt; leave him with the absolute conviction that he is God. The doctor suggests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the seizures may have disrupted a part of the brain &quot;whose activity is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The doctor failed, however, to mention that it may also be conducive to the

<em>&gt; Conclusion: The cognitive significance of sensations makes experience the most

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So can we draw the following conclusions?
<br>
<p>1. Up until recently, the DEMM (deep emotional meaning manufacturing) chunk
<br>
of the mind was a positive factor for society overall. While it led to
<br>
the development of religions which became rather rigidly enforced on the
<br>
society, this also allowed the society to remain stable, which probably
<br>
allowed science and technology and trade etc. to grow. Societies of
<br>
individuals without this hardware must not have been as stable.
<br>
<p>2. Unfortunately, this same DEMM hardware is now very dangerous to the
<br>
future.
