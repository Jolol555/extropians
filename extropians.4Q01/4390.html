<em>&gt; Barbara Lamar wrote:...She went off into a rant about how that would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going against God's will. It was useless to try to point out to her that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medical procedures have the aim of prolonging life (the will of the god she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worships is apparently for people to live short, meaningless lives). Barbara
</em><br>
<p>She should be introduced to Seventh Day Adventist philosophy.  They
<br>
teach that it is gods will that humans should live long and healthy lives,
<br>
ideally forever, and that it is satan's will that man should die (so death and
<br>
evil are all satans fault).  Most religions have no good answer for how god
<br>
can be both all powerful and all good, since good people suffer.  SDA has
<br>
toyed with a god-model where god *really isnt all powerful* and
<br>
cannot necessarily save sinners indefinitely.
<br>
<p>Note that among the early SDAs were many health reformers and
<br>
encouragers of vegetarianism, such as John Harvey Kellogg, the
<br>
inventor of corn flakes and other breakfast foods.  I figure if any
<br>
christian religion ever gets behind cryonics, it will be SDA, since
<br>
they will see cryonics and other radical life extension techniques
<br>
as being in accordance with the will of god.  Christians, in general,
<br>
often find reasons against cryonics within the framework of their
<br>
beliefs, however, I have yet to find a single SDA who can think
<br>
of any aspect of their religion which is in opposition to cryonics.
