U.N. report points out new robo-possibilities
<br>
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/650105.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/news/650105.asp</a>
<br>
GENEVA, Oct. 31 —  Robots, already used in record numbers in industry across
<br>
the world, could be employed more widely in the fight against terrorism, a
<br>
U.N. expert said Wednesday.
<br>
<p>MOBILE BOMB-FIGHTING robots can already inspect suspicious cars, buildings or
<br>
mail for explosives or hazardous materials, according to Jan Karlsson, an
<br>
expert at the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the airliner hijacking attacks on the World Trade Center in New
<br>
York and the Pentagon near Washington on Sept. 11, which killed about 4,800
<br>
people, along with anthrax cases among postal workers, exposed security gaps
<br>
which robots could fill.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It is quite clear that it would have been an expanding area even
<br>
without Sept. 11. Everything to do with inspection, surveillance and handling
<br>
substances in environments hostile for human beings is expanding, not just for
<br>
anti-terrorism but for maintenance purposes,” Karlsson told Reuters.
<br>
<p>ROBOTIC RECORD
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Geneva-based commission, in its annual study of the industry issued
<br>
Wednesday and titled “World Robotics 2001,” said a record 100,000 robots were
<br>
installed last year, up 25 percent on 1999.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 750,000 robot units now work worldwide in sectors ranging
<br>
from the car industry to farming and health care.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is definitely a much higher incentive to invest in automated
<br>
technology to fight terrorists,” Karlsson said. “It could be used in post
<br>
offices, in surveillance of offices after hours and to inspect suspicious
<br>
cars.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Postal Service — whose postmaster told a Senate panel Tuesday
<br>
that the financial impact of the anthrax crisis could be several billion
<br>
dollars — uses robots to sort parcels, but other automated equipment sorts
<br>
letters, according to Karlsson.
<br>
<p>BETTER AND CHEAPER
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karlsson told a news briefing: “Robots are getting cheaper and
<br>
cheaper and better and better. At the same time, labor costs are more and
<br>
more.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For industrial robots, 2000 was the best year ever,” added the Swede.
<br>
“Not only in Japan and Europe and North America, but they have also started to
<br>
take off in some developing countries, for example in Brazil, Mexico, China
<br>
and South Africa.”
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annual sales of robot units are estimated at $5 billion to $6 billion,
<br>
Karlsson said. But with the cost of installing necessary software and
<br>
integration systems, the total robotics market could be worth closer to $25
<br>
billion, he said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 50 systems of firefighting and bomb-disposal robots have been
<br>
sold through 2000 in countries including Israel and Britain, according to
<br>
Karlsson.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study, written before the devastating U.S. attacks, predicts sales
<br>
of 120 systems by 2004.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 2,300 robots work in demolition, servicing or dismantling
<br>
nuclear, chemical, waste or other hazardous complexes, the report said.
<br>
Another 60 robots work in surveillance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Guard robots are used privately and professionally to detect intruders
<br>
or fire,” Karlsson said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Pentagon have several, and they are used in nuclear plants in the
<br>
United States and Europe, but the market is still rather marginal,” he said.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
