<em>&gt;From: &quot;J. R. Molloy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jr@shasta.com?Subject=Re:%20BOOK:%20The%20Mystery%20of%20Capital&In-Reply-To=&lt;200110191342.GAA16413@well.com&gt;">jr@shasta.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;So they need deeds, titles, and corporate law, otherwise they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not playing for keeps. Alright, that makes sense. It's not enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to use money, they also need to use a whole new memeplex. Well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't forget that the West had to go through a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revolutions (French, American, Renaisance, etc.) to get where it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is today. We should expect no less trauma in bringing the Balkans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into 21st century capitalism. China is still working on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remnants of its &quot;cultural revolution&quot; and is predicted by some to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become the next economic super power, but other parts of the far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;East are capitalist tigers already(Singapore, Taiwan, Japan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc.), so if they can do it, then so can the Balkans. Did de Soto
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forget that it's not just &quot;the West&quot; that is prospering with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capitalism? India's on the verge of taking the plunge too.
</em><br>
<p>The theme of De Soto's book is that even in the west we forgot how
<br>
capitalism evolved. Countries try to adopt the end result without
<br>
having in place the necessary infrastructure.
<br>
<p>De Soto went back in history to study the evolution of the American
<br>
economic system. He draws parallels between the very same problems
<br>
experienced by newly formed free market societies and early
<br>
America.
<br>
<p>He then attempts to show what is necessary to go from where they
<br>
are to where they want to be. It is nothing short of revolutionary.
<br>
<p>I bet this guy wins a Nobel prize.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;How 'bout China? Not taking off? What do you want... everything at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wal Mart is made in China.
</em><br>
<p>One of the reasons I don't shop Wal-Mart. De Soto has mentioned
<br>
both India and China (I'm 25% into the book) but has already
<br>
pointed out significant problems with both.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;de Soto sez:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;They have adopted superficial products of capitalist society, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not the &quot;representational forms&quot; underlying capitalist societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and freeing capital in a &quot;vast hidden process that connects all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the assets to the rest of the economy&quot; and gives them a &quot;parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;life in the creation of new assets.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;.... and that's Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Everywhere Else?
</em><br>
<p>Yep, and makes a damn good case for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Yes, de Soto continuz:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the real problem is that such countries have yet to establish and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;normalize the invisible network of laws that turns assets from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;dead&quot; into &quot;liquid&quot; capital. In the West, standardized laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;allow us to mortgage a house to raise money for a new venture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;permit the worth of a company to be broken up into so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;publicly tradable stocks, and make it possible to govern and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;appraise property with agreed-upon rules that hold across
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;neighborhoods, towns, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;regions. This invisible infrastructure of &quot;asset management&quot;--so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;taken for granted in the West, even though it has only fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;existed in the United States for the past 100 years--is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;missing ingredient to success with capitalism, insists de Soto.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;But even though that link is primarily a legal one, he argues
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that the process of making it a normalized component of a society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is more a political--or attitude-changing--challenge than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;anything else.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;So, the answer is: Everyone needs to own their own home. Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they'll have a stake in the welfare of their communities. Big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deal... any Real Estate Principles teacher could have told us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that. Why do you think State governments provide low interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;loans (VA, graduated mortgage, Cal-Vet, FHA, RECD, etc.) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;potential home buyers? That's right, to encourage home ownership.
</em><br>
<p>Its a great deal more complex than that, you've oversimplified what
<br>
he is saying. As he points out bureaucracy makes it almost
<br>
impossible to own your own home/land/company in many countries much
<br>
less use it as an economic asset.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;All we need to understand (and teach formerly communist countries)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for. capitalist success is &quot;asset management.&quot; It's something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way too few Americans understand, which is why too many young
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Americans suffer the consequences of enormous credit card debt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(The US economy isn't as healthy as your stock broker would like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you to believe either.)
</em><br>
<p>I agree that everyone needs to learn this, but this is not the
<br>
whole answer as I believe De Soto correctly points out.
<br>
<p>Without the infrastructure, asset management as we practice it here
<br>
in the west isn't possible in these countries.
<br>
<p>I really think you'd enjoy the book, I'm damn sorry I wasn't
<br>
introduced to it at Extro-5. (Damn I hated missing that!)
