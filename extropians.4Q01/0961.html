<p>My knowledge of history is dubious at best, but I think there was
<br>
a time in Europe where the Christians were forbidden under usury
<br>
laws from profitting from loaning capital.  Fortunately they had Jews
<br>
living among them who were under no such restrictions.  The Jews
<br>
had many restrictions in other areas, such that the structure of the
<br>
laws practically forced them into banking, which turned out to be
<br>
enormously profitable.  Perhaps someone can fill in the details.  spike
