Thanks! I've glanced at your criticism, and it looks like food for thought.
<br>
<p>I'm not delving deeply into Bartley until I get ahold of his second edition
<br>
a fortnight from now. I find myself looking for decent heuristics, not
<br>
absolute truth; but I'll try to remain as intellectually honest as possible
<br>
in the process.
<br>
<p>In your work cited, you say 
<br>
&quot;I believe other philosophies can answer the skeptic, but only ones that 
<br>
provide a system that goes further than pancritical rationalism allows.&quot;
<br>
<p>I look forward to reading more of your stuff to see what I make of it, but 
<br>
I'm not sure Bartley's skeptic is your skeptic. :) That verb, &quot;is&quot;, sure can
<br>
be tricky. :)
<br>
<p>What do you make of Lakoff and Johnson? Apologies if you've already said.
<br>
I think Lakoff is doing something interesting, even if I disagree with his
<br>
interpretations or emphases.
