<em>&gt; My comment concerns the dropping of the other shoe. That W Bush needs to liberate American reliance from Wahabbi-owned fuels-namely oil. And no! I don't buy the &quot;lets use their oil up first&quot; philosophy peddled by morons, who have no &quot;backup&quot; fuel source
</em><br>
.
<br>
<p>It's not necessarily moronic. It deprives them of future resources that
<br>
would be needed if they ever got their infrastructure and strategic
<br>
gamesmanship asses together, they are willing to sell out their futures
<br>
on the cheap in exchange for a reliable income (and long term oil supply
<br>
contracts, which make up more than 2/3 of the oil market, go for far
<br>
less per barrel than the spot market rates you read about in the funny
<br>
pages) today.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, there is a 'backup' fuel source: nuclear power.
<br>
<p>The SUV phenom of the 90's would never have taken place if the
<br>
efficiency gains of the 1980's had not gone way overboard beyond what an
<br>
unimpeded market would have developed.
<br>
<p>I'm sitting here in New England which just had one of the coldest years
<br>
in 100, including the latest ending winter and the earliest frost since
<br>
the 19th century. Despite having one of the highest fossil fuel
<br>
consumption density levels in the world, we are experiencing not only no
<br>
global warming, but no local warming either. How many were amazed at
<br>
Extro5 (June 15th) at my explaination for my buzz cut (I get it cut
<br>
after the first truly hot day of the year). I was still shoveling myself
<br>
out of the driveway in May. Most of the leaves have fallen and it's
<br>
barely past the middle of october, the geese are already well into their
<br>
migration, as are the woodcock.
<br>
<p>While one year a trend does not make, I'm having significant doubts
<br>
after a few similar years as to the validity of claims that the US needs
<br>
to account for CO2 externalities in its tax structure on the fuel
<br>
market.
<br>
<p>The spoiler:
<br>
Here is the real reason foreign spats mess with our oil market so badly:
<br>
oil windfall profits taxes. If you make too big a profit on oil you take
<br>
out of the ground here at home, you pay extra taxes on it. Consequently,
<br>
when foreign suppliers spike their supplies, pushing the spot market
<br>
higher, well established low cost domestic wells shut down production
<br>
for the duration to avoid paying the windfall profits tax, only to start
<br>
up again when the prices drop back to the high teens to low 20's per
<br>
bbl.
<br>
<p>I know a fellow who has shut down all of his wells, which produce for
<br>
between $8.00-12.00 per bbl, until oil prices drop back to below $20.00
<br>
per bbl.
