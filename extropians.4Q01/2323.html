<p><em>&gt;&gt;One of the most difficult tasks for any social system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;figuring out what to do with its young males. These are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;invariably the most impressionable, energetic, socially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;exigent, and politically inept members of any group. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cause trouble for their elders and ruthlessly hassle each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;other. They pose chronic danger to public order when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;drive, drink and take drugs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The author makes a HUGE assumption that Muslim teenagers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different from teenagers all over the world, and the author
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continues to place links before the reader that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Muslims == terrorists.
</em><br>
<p>Read the text.  The author is pointing out the teenagers are
<br>
the *same* everywhere, viz, problematic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Almost all of the Muslims strongly dislike the activities of the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;terrorists, including bin Laden.   
</em><br>
<p>That's a claim, and needs to be backed up.  Certainly enough
<br>
approve to make &quot;Osama/Usama&quot; become a far more common
<br>
name than it used to be.  Enough to mangage substantial
<br>
demonstrations in favor of the event. And enough that the
<br>
one Muslim guy at the Halloween party I went to thought it
<br>
was required and justified. (!)
<br>
<p>If a lot of Muslim support such activities we have a big problem
<br>
even if the majority don't
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;high sex segregation&quot; ? &quot;tightly restricted&quot; ?
</em><br>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, if a woman goes to a supermarket all men must
<br>
leave it first.  They can't drive, either.  I'll go for &quot;high sex
<br>
segregation.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Wrong. In Egypt young people, men and women, are mixed in their
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;interactions with each other. The only segration occurs inside of a
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;mosque.
</em><br>
<p>Correct; most Muslims don't live under sharia; but bin Laden and 
<br>
company want them to.  Egypt is near the top of their hit list, 
<br>
precisely so they *can* segregate women there.  Ditto for the 
<br>
fact the most Egyptian women avoid oppressive veiling; that will
<br>
be changed if Al-Qaida gets its way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Polygamy is not common there. Not in Egypt. It's slighly more common
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;in the Gulf states than in Egypt, but it's still very unusual. Of
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;men, you find mostly the richest (in Saudi Arabia, for example) or
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;the most powerful politicians living a polygamous lifestyle (even
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;though their religion permits it).
</em><br>
<p>As Robert pointed out, just a few % polygamous creates millions
<br>
of unmated males.  1 million men is a huge army.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;On 5 August 1996, Egyptian academic and writer Dr Nasr Hamed
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Abu-Zeid was ordered to divorce from his wife after being branded an
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;apostate by the Court of Cassation.
</em><br>
<p>Note: even in a *moderate* Muslim society people are exiled,
<br>
forced to divorce, and imprisoned for religious beliefs.  I don't remember
<br>
exactly what this guy said, but I remember the controversy and that
<br>
he was proposing a Muslim version of current mainstream Christian
<br>
theology.  People die in Pakistan for less, and I am *not* exaggerating.
