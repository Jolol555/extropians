See if you agree with this:
<br>
<p>Suppose we lived in a world in which copy protection of information
<br>
could be achieved.  It seems unlikely that we live in such a world, but
<br>
suppose that were the case.  It might be possible in a fully transparent
<br>
society, for example (since violations could be observed and prosecuted -
<br>
this has been my theory from the beginning for why David Brin originally
<br>
advanced this notion).
<br>
<p>And suppose further that reproduction of information in this world is
<br>
still essentially free.
<br>
<p>Then I would propose that this would lead to the optimal allocation of
<br>
resources for the production of information and other goods.  That is,
<br>
allowing for enforceable restrictions on copying information would
<br>
maximize the total wealth of society.  And further, even though creators
<br>
of information would have total control over its copying, prices would
<br>
be driven down to the point where information was almost free.
<br>
<p>This follows from the basic theorems of market behavior, that markets
<br>
optimally allocate resources and prices are driven towards the costs
<br>
of production.  And it is further supported by the observation that
<br>
public goods (which is what information would be if controls on copying
<br>
were impossible, as the original article noted) are under-produced by a
<br>
market economy.
<br>
<p>Hence the optimal situation would be one where copying of information was
<br>
impossible without permission of the creator.  Do people here agree?
<br>
<p>Note though that it does not follow that we should impose such controls
<br>
at any cost.  If allowing this kind of control has significant costs, as
<br>
appears to me to be the case, then that has to be taken into consideration
<br>
as well.
<br>
