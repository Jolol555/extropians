<em>&gt; ### You are quite right pointing out that the change from oil will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take many years - it's unlikely that there will be a sudden breakdown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the production of oil (short of WW III for real). Even if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Middle East were to become unstable, there are enough altenative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources to tide the US over, although at a steep price. Most likely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as outlined in an article in the Scientific American last year (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; September, I think), there will be a gradual decline in oil production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a slow changeover to other sources of energy, which will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effected without the need for government intervention (except basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; R&amp;D)
</em><br>
<p>Oil production will never cease, though it might become a minor energy
<br>
source. Use of petrochemicals in the materials industry for plastics and
<br>
other polymers and composite materials will expand once again when the
<br>
current glut in the metals industry produced by the opening of Russia to
<br>
western trade is absorbed by economic growth.
<br>
<p>If we get to the point of building a skyhook, it will likely become the
<br>
largest consumer of oil byproducts in history.
