<em>&gt; I don't know if you got my point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) I wouldn't feel safe with _anyone_ in that bar carrying a gun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   not even you or me. Why? Because one of the &quot;ordinary&quot; persons could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   feel so &quot;empowered&quot; to escalate the situation. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) I wouldn't feel safe if someone would always carry a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Molotov Cocktail either, because this would (from my view) also be a sign
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   of a fearful and potential dangerous person. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (3) I am talking from my perspective here in Germany, where we'd rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   call the police than try to play the hero. (cf. Sting: &quot;Englishman In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   New York&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>Your point 3 contradicts your point 1, because you /do/ in fact want the
<br>
policeman to carry a gun, otherwise he will be unprepared to deal with the
<br>
possibly dangerous and violent situation for which you called him.  You
<br>
seem to have a typically European bias that somehow the policeman is more
<br>
qualified to &quot;play hero&quot; than other citizens, while the American tradition
<br>
leans more toward self-reliance.
<br>
<p>Secondly, how do your feelings deal with the fact that technologies are
<br>
on the horizon that make a handgun seem like a child's toy?  The &quot;problem&quot;
<br>
(if there is one) with firearms is no different from any other empowering
<br>
technology: it empowers evil people to do more evil, and good people to
<br>
do more good--but since we fear the former, we restrict the technology
<br>
which ends up limiting the latter.  The extropian ideal is to create new
<br>
and better technologies that empower the good guys more, to keep ahead of
<br>
the bad guys, and figure out what causes people to become bad guys and
<br>
deal with that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have heard this argument before: &quot;The minorities&quot; are far more violent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and criminal than the rest. (I won't discuss prejudices of the police and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice here) It is sad to say that the numbers seem to confirm this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, in the US as well as here.
</em><br>
<p>Mike said nothing of the sort, and nothing even remotely resembling this.
<br>
It seems clear to me that you didn't even try to read and understand what
<br>
he did say, and this reflects very poorly on the value of anything you
<br>
might have to say.
