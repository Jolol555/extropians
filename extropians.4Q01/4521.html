<p>Lord, the 2nd time in 3 months people have expressed an opinion with
<br>
regard to 'censoring' my expressions.
<br>
<p>I guess I'll have to write it off to: &quot;Q7: Other people frequently tell me
<br>
that what I've said is impolite, even though I think it is polite.&quot; to which
<br>
I &quot;slightly agreed&quot;.
<br>
<p>I will defend it from the perspective of &quot;Here is a perspective&quot;.
<br>
I do not know if is the &quot;best&quot; or &quot;right' perspective, but it is
<br>
a perspective with both (a) some experience; and (b) some reason
<br>
behind the perspective.  So it is a &quot;defensible&quot; position.
<br>
I would challenge people to assay the progress that would occur
<br>
in our society if all individauls attempted to conform to the median.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I think that announcing one's autism or Aspergerish nature might prove,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm on the record with regard to tearing down the solar system
<br>
so I don't think there is much salvation by renouncing my position there.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the best I can do is announce that there is little to attract
<br>
my kleptomaniac tendencies (why steal something when one could invent
<br>
something better) and the only point to womanizing is to practice it
<br>
on individuals who can enjoy and appreciate such entertainments.
<br>
I suspect that is a relatively small fraction of the overall population.
<br>
<p>Robert
