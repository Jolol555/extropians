quoeth miriam
<br>
&lt;Most people are happy to put up with a lot 
<br>
of inequity in order to make the system work&gt;
<br>
<p>Miriam, 
<br>
As much as I love all y'all socialists ;0
<br>
I'd like to suggest you amend this statement
<br>
in accordance with the sort of results that
<br>
empathic statism generally brings.
<br>
<p>The statement should be
<br>
&lt;Most of the people [who's opinion's
<br>
aren't disqualified by being people who are
<br>
evil/hate-ridden/greedy/selfish] are happy
<br>
to put up with a lot of inequity [especially
<br>
in the lives of others] in order to make the
<br>
system [appear to] work&gt;.
<br>
<p>The system doesn't *work*. It just parasitizes.
<br>
The less it parasitizes, the healthier we all are.
<br>
&nbsp;To even attempt making the system work
<br>
requires coercion, because there will ALWAYS
<br>
be people who find your politics (or my politics or
<br>
ANBODY'S politics) repellant.  Just because you
<br>
think something is a neat and happy shiny caring
<br>
idea is not sufficent justification for Big Brother to
<br>
get in on a crusade.  That's the real problem with
<br>
private production of anything resembling a
<br>
replacement for government, isn't it?  If you had
<br>
to make your notions of utopia work without the
<br>
&quot;power that comes from a barrel of a gun&quot; and
<br>
force monopolies that back up the taxation system...
<br>
well you might not get as far. (Don't take that the wrong
<br>
way...we ALL have Utopian notions :)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember...ultimately the best thing to do to others
<br>
is to leave them alone..and vote for people who will do
<br>
the same.
<br>
<p><p>just my 3cents.
<br>
Brian
