Dickey, Michael F wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; Is it me or does this conversation seem to be skipping the important point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the backup is not me, but a copy of me.  And that if I die, even if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backup lives on, there is no continuity of conscioussness.
</em><br>
<p>If you check the archives, you will see that this is a never-ending debate
<br>
on this list.  It has been rehashed many times, and I am not aware of anyone
<br>
changing their mind during any of the discussions.
<br>
<p>Some people (including myself) agree with you that a person and a copy are
<br>
two identical yet separate individual consciousnesses.  Other people will
<br>
argue that if they are exact copies, they are the &quot;same&quot; consciousness,
<br>
indistinguishable, and it doesn't matter which one lives on.
<br>
<p>Both sides insist that their way is obvious and logically provable.  As far
<br>
as I can tell, the logical proofs of both sides are each consistent within
<br>
themselves and consistent with the framework of the presenter.  However,
<br>
neither side's logical proofs seem to translate to the other side's
<br>
framework, because the very definitions of identity, &quot;same&quot;, &quot;separate&quot;, and
<br>
even methods of counting individuals are inconsistent.
<br>
<p>The argument finally boils down, in my opinion, to semantics.  Given the
<br>
definition of identity that claims the two copies are separate, we can prove
<br>
that the two copies are separate.  Given the definition of identity that
<br>
claims all copies are the same individual, we can prove that all copies are
<br>
the same individual.  Assuming the opposing side's definitions for the sake
<br>
of argument, most logical thinkers will agree that the opposing side's
<br>
viewpoint holds true.  However, the thinker still is not convinced to switch
<br>
sides, because they are attached to one definition over another.
<br>
<p>In the end, it boils down to different definitions of goals and personal
<br>
preferences.  Some prefer that every instance of consciousness continues
<br>
onward, while others only desire that at least one instance of each
<br>
consciousness continues onward.  Thus, neither can be proven right or wrong.
<br>
Both scenarios can occur in the real word.  The real disagreement is the
<br>
personal choice of which is desirable.  Each individual must answer this
<br>
question for themselves.
<br>
<p>However, the problem does keep popping up on this list.  As above, there is
<br>
a fundamental difference of opinion whether a mass murder had been
<br>
committed, or whether a mere temporary distraction has occurred.  Some
<br>
people will propose solutions to problems that to them sound like a simple
<br>
solution, and to others sound like a holocaust.  In many ways, this is
<br>
similar to the abortion debate.  Are we killing a few cells, or are we
<br>
killing a person?  There are obviously different reactions depending on how
<br>
we define a living individual.
<br>
<p>I would love to see a discussion about this, but I don't think it belongs in
<br>
this forum.  It is a very specific philosophical question about how to
<br>
define the self, others, identity, and other meta-questions about what it
<br>
means to be &quot;me&quot;.
