<p>Crash Inquiry Focuses on Tail Fin That Broke Off
<br>
By MATTHEW L. WALD and AL BAKER
<br>
<p>Investigators are focusing on how the tail fin of American Airlines Flight 
<br>
587 was ripped away from the spine of the aircraft in the moments after 
<br>
takeoff Monday, and what role that played in the deadly crash.
<br>
<p>Officials of the National Transportation Safety Board are not close to 
<br>
declaring that the loss of the fin, a 27- foot-high structure that is 
<br>
essential to flight, was the cause of the crash, or even the first part to 
<br>
leave the jetliner, an Airbus A300, in its puzzling in-flight breakup.
<br>
<p>But as a sign of how air safety experts are concentrating on the fin, 
<br>
American Airlines decided yesterday to inspect that part on its 34 surviving 
<br>
A300's. Officials with Airbus, the European manufacturer of large airplanes, 
<br>
were discussing whether to advise other airlines to do the same. And federal 
<br>
investigators called their top scientific experts on materials to the crash 
<br>
site to study the part, which is made of a combination of plastic and carbon 
<br>
fibers, not metal.
<br>
<p>The tail was torn off, leaving the attachment points, which are made of the 
<br>
same composite, still bolted to the plane's metal frame, investigators said. 
<br>
They have not found any evidence that an explosion or contact with another 
<br>
object in flight caused the damage.
<br>
<p>The tail was found in Jamaica Bay, the first piece in a trail of debris, 
<br>
though officials said they could not conclude it was the first part of the 
<br>
plane to break off. Information being retrieved last night from the plane's 
<br>
damaged flight data recorder may shed more light on what happened, officials 
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Despite this new focus on the tail fin, the board has not ruled out any 
<br>
cause for the crash, which killed 260 people on the plane and 5 on the 
<br>
ground in Belle Harbor, Queens. Investigators still say that they have found 
<br>
no evidence of criminal acts, including terrorism.
<br>
<p>Loss of the tail fin would have made flight impossible, pilots said. Among 
<br>
the questions for investigators are whether the fin separated because of 
<br>
stresses that its design should have been able to handle or if the plane, in 
<br>
the air less than two minutes on a day with light winds and clear air, 
<br>
somehow encountered extreme air conditions.
<br>
<p>The cockpit voice recorder captured the sound of the plane rattling, and the 
<br>
two pilots said they believed they were encountering the turbulent wake of 
<br>
an airplane ahead of them. Such encounters are routine, though investigators 
<br>
have not confirmed that Flight 587 actually did pass through turbulence from 
<br>
another plane.
<br>
<p>It was following a Japan Airlines Boeing 747 as it departed Runway 31 at 
<br>
Kennedy International Airport Monday morning. Rules require that planes be 
<br>
separated by four miles on takeoff, and indications so far are that the 
<br>
distance between the two planes was greater than that.
<br>
<p>Marion C. Blakey, the chairwoman of the transportation safety board, said at 
<br>
a briefing yesterday afternoon that the paths of the two planes and the 
<br>
timing &quot;would be consistent with a wake vortex encounter.&quot;
<br>
<p>She added: &quot;That said, I want to stress that we do not know the specific 
<br>
facts here, beyond that. We do not know whether this really contributed in 
<br>
any way to the actual accident, but we are looking at this very closely.&quot;
<br>
<p>On Tuesday, the safety board took the unusual step of calling its chief 
<br>
materials scientist from his laboratory to the crash site. Yesterday it 
<br>
asked the Federal Aviation Administration to call in its top scientist with 
<br>
that specialty. If the crash is attributed to the failure of a nonmetal 
<br>
composite part, it would be the first time that had happened to a commercial 
<br>
jetliner, experts said.
<br>
<p>Airbus, far more than Boeing, its main rival, relies heavily on composite 
<br>
materials, to save weight and to avoid corrosion. Experts say that composite 
<br>
materials are stronger per pound than aluminum, and are less prone to 
<br>
fatigue, in which repeated flexing weakens the material.
<br>
<p>But composite materials also can weaken. Sometimes the reinforcing carbon 
<br>
comes loose from the matrix that forms the bulk of the composite, or layers 
<br>
come apart, a process called delamination.
<br>
<p>Investigators seemed to be settling in yesterday for a long investigation, 
<br>
although they have already begun clearing away the wreckage. Both engines 
<br>
were trucked to Kennedy Airport for analysis. They will then be sent to an 
<br>
American Airlines maintenance base in Tulsa.
<br>
<p>&quot;We won't have a eureka moment here,&quot; said a high-ranking investigator. He 
<br>
added that he was confident that the safety board would find the cause, 
<br>
although it might take months.
<br>
<p>The crash, the first in the United States of an Airbus, is unusual because 
<br>
big jets seldom break up in the air. But it is now usual for the 
<br>
circumstances of crashes to be unusual, because the level of air safety is 
<br>
so sophisticated. Once a problem is found to have caused one crash, it is 
<br>
corrected on other airplanes and seldom given the opportunity to cause 
<br>
another. Thus each crash tends to be from a new cause.
<br>
<p>One transportation official described the investigation as filled with 
<br>
&quot;head-scratching and bafflement and puzzlement.&quot; George W. Black Jr., the 
<br>
member of the safety board assigned to the crash, said the case was &quot;weird.&quot;
<br>
<p>At a briefing last night, Mr. Black gave several details that tended to 
<br>
narrow the focus of the investigation:
<br>
<p>¶Analysis of the sounds on the cockpit voice recorder showed that the 
<br>
engines continued working beyond the point where the pilots seemed to lose 
<br>
control of the plane.
<br>
<p>¶According to the maintenance log recovered from the crash site, there had 
<br>
been no major repairs recently, and no items awaited repair.
<br>
<p>¶The fittings that hold the fin to the fuselage are visually inspected every 
<br>
five years; the most recent inspection for the plane that crashed was in 
<br>
December 1999.
<br>
<p>¶Before the plane was delivered in 1988, the composite material in one of 
<br>
the six fittings holding the tail in place was found to be delaminating, 
<br>
meaning its layers were coming apart. It was fixed by adding layers and 
<br>
inserting rivets, and the manufacturer decided that no extra inspections 
<br>
were required afterward.
<br>
<p><p>The investigators have many areas of inquiry still open. One is that seven 
<br>
years ago, the plane hit turbulence in flight and 47 people on board were 
<br>
injured. Whether this could have produced structural damage that went 
<br>
undetected was not clear, although the plane itself was designed to 
<br>
withstand a degree of turbulence that could result in injuries or deaths.
<br>
<p>One new area for investigators is the composites, which are harder to read 
<br>
for clues than metal parts. They have been used for years, but usually in 
<br>
doors or panels, not in the plane's skeleton. American Airlines will use a 
<br>
variety of inspection techniques, including a tap test, in which technicians 
<br>
hit the part and listen for sounds that would indicate a void, said Thomas 
<br>
Haueter, the board's deputy chief of aviation safety.
<br>
<p>Advocates say carbon composites are better than metal. &quot;It will outperform 
<br>
aluminum in fatigue,&quot; said Stephen I. Miscencik, the chief of design 
<br>
engineering at TPI Composites, a company in Warren, R.I., that makes bus 
<br>
bodies, yachts and windmill blades out of composites. &quot;It's a super material 
<br>
to use in fatigue applications,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.
<br>
<p>The carbon and plastic composites used by aircraft manufacturers tend to be 
<br>
extremely strong and resistant to cracking, and were strenuously tested, 
<br>
Robert T. Bocchieri said. Dr. Bocchieri is an expert in assessing failures 
<br>
of composite materials and a senior engineer at Applied Research Associates, 
<br>
an engineering firm in Sunnyvale, Calif.
<br>
<p>Cracks develop in metals or plastics as they age, but cracks tend to be 
<br>
stopped in these materials by the embedded fibers, he said. Still, &quot;aircraft 
<br>
makers have tended to be extremely conservative in their use of composites,&quot; 
<br>
he said.
<br>
<p>Because the materials, when proposed for airliners, were intended for a new 
<br>
domain in which hundreds of lives were at stake, they &quot;were put through 
<br>
massive numbers of cycles of full-scale testing,&quot; Dr. Bocchieri said. &quot;They 
<br>
had to simulate the entire life history of the aircraft.&quot;
<br>
<p>Airbus has made progressively greater use of composites. It plans to expand 
<br>
their use even further in its A380 superjumbo jet. According to Airbus, each 
<br>
A300 uses 14,600 pounds of composites, and by doing so, saves 3,300 pounds 
<br>
of weight.
<br>
<p>The fin of the A300 is almost all composite. Mr. Black said yesterday that 
<br>
when it was pulled from Jamaica Bay, the fin looked good.
<br>
<p>&quot;With the exception of the area where it separated, it is almost in new 
<br>
condition,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Both the fin and the rudder, the movable panel at the back of the fin, can 
<br>
float, he said. Aviation experts said that both could have traveled a 
<br>
significant distance from the spot at which they separated from the plane. 
<br>
Thus, although they were found closer to the airport than the main wreckage, 
<br>
investigators are not certain that they were the first to come loose.
<br>
<p>The investigators displayed a poster-size chart of radar images, but some of 
<br>
the images clustered like flocks of birds, which they probably were.
<br>
<p>With further work, the investigators hope to determine which of the radar 
<br>
echoes were actually airplane parts.
