old.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Olga, where is the racist jibe? I don't see one. ... He didn't even
</em><br>
*complain*
<br>
<em>&gt; about the situation. He simply gave his view of why he lost his job,
</em><br>
fairly
<br>
<em>&gt; plausibly.
</em><br>
<p>I took the very fact that Mike posted what he did into consideration.  In
<br>
the past he has referred to various cultures in South America and Mexico as
<br>
kleptocracies, and if I remember correctly - was one of the people who saw
<br>
nothing racist in that lovely article that someone posted by Fred Reed.  But
<br>
(please oh please oh please) we don't need to rehash the Reed screed.
<br>
<p>It may in fact be Mike's opinion that he is being displaced by &quot;Indian job
<br>
shops.&quot;  I'm not exactly sure what that is, and I am assuming he didn't mean
<br>
&quot;Indians&quot; from a  particular Indus Valley civilization, but our own native
<br>
kind, yes?
<br>
<p>If Mike had said:  &quot;...while local employers prefer to outsource the sort of
<br>
work I do to Jews ...&quot; would that that have been racist?  I think so.  Of if
<br>
he had said &quot;...while local employers prefer to outsource the sort of work I
<br>
do to blacks...&quot; would that have been racist?  I think so.
<br>
<p>In my own locality of King County, Washington, voters defeated an
<br>
Affirmative Action bill not too long ago.  Do I think that was racist?  Yes.
<br>
While some people think Affirmative Action itself is &quot;racist&quot; (even though
<br>
the group of people who've benefited the most from Affirmative Action in the
<br>
past, I believe, have been &quot;white&quot; women) I think it balances things out
<br>
better (and much faster) than if humans were left to root out for the milk
<br>
of human kindness on their own.
<br>
<p>While Mike may not have been complaining directly, it seemed as if he were
<br>
playing a kind of &quot;blame game&quot; with racist overtones, at the very least.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He simply gave his view of why he lost his job, fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausibly.
</em><br>
<p>And I've simply given my view of how what Mike said came across to me.  I
<br>
have nothing against Mike personally.
<br>
<p>O.
