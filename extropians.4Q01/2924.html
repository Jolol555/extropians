<p><em>    &gt;Regardless of whether they are *right* or *wrong*, the above propositions
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; are not *idiotic*
</em><br>
<p>Well some are some are not, let's take them one at a time.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; 1)  The US intervention in Afghanistan is doing more harm than good.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, not idiotic just wrong.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; 2)  A superior strategy for the US would have been to turn the other
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; cheek, thus gaining moral superiority and showing the world that we don't
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; always bomb people we don't like.
</em><br>
<p>That is Idiotic and it is more. If western civilization is perceived as being so effete
<br>
that even the murder of 6 thousand of its citizens will not provoke it into action then
<br>
it's suicidal for us as well. Non violence worked for Gandhi because he was dealing with
<br>
the British, it would not have been a successful strategy for the Jews to use against
<br>
the Nazis and it won't work against a creature like Bin Laden.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; 3)  The number of dead Afghan civilians has vastly exceeded the number of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; dead American civilians, and this puts the US in the wrong.
</em><br>
<p>First of all I don't believe that's going to turn out to be true, but I grant you that part is
<br>
not idiotic. However the idea that you count the number of American civilians killed and
<br>
then kill exactly 5952 Afghanistan civilians and stop is idiotic.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; 4)  What happened to the US was directly caused by the US carrying out an
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; inconsistent and immoral strategy in foreign relations over the past fifty years.
</em><br>
<p>Totally Irrelevant but not totally untrue.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; 5)  The US is currently in the grip of a fever of destructive hatred and
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; this hatred is both morally wrong and strategically counterproductive,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; regardless of all other moral issues involved.
</em><br>
<p>More of the not idiotic just wrong category.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; 6)  Bin Laden may not have had just cause to blow up the World Trade Center, but [...]
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly what makes my blood boil, the &quot;may&quot; and the &quot;but&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; 7)  It would be wrong to impose US culture on Afghanistan as retaliation
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; for the World Trade Center Attack.  I do *not* believe this
</em><br>
<p>I'm glad to hear you say that because this is big time idiotic.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; 8)  Technology, science, and the Internet are mere artifacts of Western
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; culture which don't belong to the ancient Afghan traditions - rather than
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; being the products of intelligence itself and therefore the universal
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; heritage of every human on the planet, regardless of what the Taliban
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; believes about the &quot;Westernizes&quot; of technology, as the result of temporary
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; differentials in technological advancement that happen to be correlated
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; with different cultures.  (I believe the latter.)
</em><br>
<p>Huh? What does that have to do with the price of eggs?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Samantha attacked your ideas; she didn't attack you.
</em><br>
<p>A distinction without a difference. I don't have ideas I am ideas, if Samantha Atkins has
<br>
idiotic ideas then Samantha Atkins is an idiot. This is life and death, politeness be damned.
