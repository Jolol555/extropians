<p>Actually, if you study animal behavior you will find that many animals do
<br>
have something that appears as a wish to live - when subjected to pain and
<br>
danger they try to escape it, sometimes going at great lengths of pain and
<br>
suffering just to survive. They might not have an elaborate world- or
<br>
self-model and it is not quickly or easily adjusted, but the purposeful
<br>
action towards survival is there. They wish for survival, although their
<br>
understanding of what survival means is only partial compared to human
<br>
understanding. 
<br>
<p>I agree with you about the AIs, although they still might have a right to
<br>
self determination.

<em>&gt; The word &quot;innocent&quot; stands here for a large and unwieldy meme-complex. In

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a life-wish, and for precisely that reason their wish to live need not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respected. While on a cognitive level such persons might be quite higly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; placed, from a moral standpoint their level of sentience is no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant. Whether they are dehumanized totally, losing their rational

<em>&gt; faculties, or whether their only failing is a lack of concern for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival wishes of other entities, the conclusion is the same - they may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminated as needed to advance the life-wish of innocent humans.
</em><br>
<p>Does this mean that you are allowed to shoot sociopaths whenever you feel
<br>
like it? It does advance the life-wish of innocent humans. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, the commision of murder(=killing of an innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-aware entity against its wishes) or even a verifiable willingness to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commit murder, is reason enough to lose the right to live
</em><br>
<p>If you were an anti-abortionist this would be a great argument for killing
<br>
abortion doctors and pro-abortion people, wouldn't it? The biggest danger of
<br>
your argument is that it can be interpreted so broadly.
<br>
<p><p>This goes far beyond merely being allowed to strike back at somebody
<br>
initiating force against you, since it also allows you to make pre-emptive
<br>
strikes against people judged (by whom?) as *potentially* able to initiate
<br>
force. 
<br>
<p>There is a terrible danger in making rights contingent on mental states that
<br>
cannot be checked, rather than based on actual behavior.  Beside the obvious
<br>
slippery slope of making other, less central rights (such as freedom and
<br>
property) also contingent on having the right thoughts and beliefs *as judged
<br>
by others*, revoking the right to live now depends on a judgement of mental
<br>
capability which is quite subjective, easily affected by prejudices and
<br>
self-interest and in general hard to control. 
<br>
<p>There is also a clear social danger here, since people now have no guarantees
<br>
for their lives and hence no reason to refrain from bad behavior if they have
<br>
reason to think that others consider them lacking rights - in fact, it is
<br>
imperative for them to act before their opponents. 
<br>
<p>Sure, a strict legal regulation of this might solve some of the direct
<br>
problems, but legislation is not ethics - and if you try to legislate away
<br>
ethical problems they tend to come back and bit you. A society where the
<br>
right to life is not universal and can be revoked not just for actions but
<br>
because your *thinking* violates certain standards sounds like an extremely
<br>
dangerous situation.
