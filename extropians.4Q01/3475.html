<p>
Some thoughts on the subject of terrorism, for what it's worth.
<br>
<p>I think it is very important to understand why we were attacked.
<br>
Understanding why someone attacked you may help you avoid a similar
<br>
situation in the future, for one thing.
<br>
<p>Our President has given us the official reason: we were attacked because we
<br>
represent &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;.
<br>
<p>The alleged mastermind says it was because of our interventionist foreign
<br>
policy.
<br>
<p>Others say it is fueled by fundamentalist Islamic hatred of western culture.
<br>
<p>If the President is right, then we were attacked for no good reason. If
<br>
Bin-Ladin is right, then we should realize that innocent Americans are going
<br>
to be targeted because of our governments interventionist foreign policy.
<br>
<p>Many other Western countries are wealthy, have an extensive industrial and
<br>
commercial presence overseas, support religious freedoms, democracy, export
<br>
their culture, products and services, yet seem to have much less of a
<br>
problem with terrorism than does the U.S.
<br>
<p>In 1997 it was estimated that roughly 1/3 of all terrorist attacks worldwide
<br>
are perpetrated against US targets [1].  This is high considering that the
<br>
US [unlike other nations targeted for terrorism like Algeria, Turkey, the
<br>
UK] has no internal civil war or quarrels with its neighbors that spawn
<br>
terrorism.
<br>
<p>I think there is good evidence to support the view that terrorists strike at
<br>
the U.S. because they consider Washington to be at war with them. As the
<br>
Pentagon's Defense Science Board surmised several years ago, &quot;Historical
<br>
data show a strong correlation between U.S. involvement in international
<br>
situations and an increase in terrorist attacks against the United States.&quot;
<br>
[2]  This view is supported with over 60 examples in the Cato paper &quot;Does
<br>
U.S. Intervention Overseas Breed Terrorism? The Historical Record&quot;,
<br>
available online at <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb-050es.html">http://www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb-050es.html</a>.  Even
<br>
if some terrorist attacks against the U.S. are a response to &quot;what it is&quot;,
<br>
rather than &quot;what it does&quot;, the incidents cataloged in this December 1998
<br>
paper suggest that many terrorist attacks can be traced back to an
<br>
interventionist foreign policy.
<br>
<p>IMHO, terrorism cannot be understood or effectively dealt with in isolation
<br>
from American foreign policy. Terrorism is a tactic, and it is
<br>
intellectually confusing to declare war on a tactic. You can kill individual
<br>
terrorists, but if the cause of their hatred is our interventionist foreign
<br>
policy, more will just take their place.
<br>
<p>What to do now?
<br>
Joseph Sobran recently remarked that it is a lot easier to avoid falling
<br>
into an abyss than to climb out of one. Like other Libertarians he had
<br>
warned for decades that our overseas interventions would prove costly. This
<br>
has proven so. When he was asked what we should do now, he said he felt like
<br>
the doctor who warned his patient that smoking could cause cancer. The
<br>
patient ignored him, smoked heavily, got cancer as a result and then asked
<br>
the doctor, &quot;ok, you're so smart, what do I do now?&quot; There may be no great
<br>
answer.
<br>
<p>I fear that no amount of federalization of airport security, whiz-bang
<br>
technology, cruise missiles, mile-wide atomic helicopters, offices of
<br>
homeland security or electronic surveillance will stop Americans from being
<br>
attacked if our government continues to generate such hatred abroad.  But
<br>
the political leadership of the U.S. does not want to change its
<br>
interventionist foreign policy, instead, it will insist that Americans give
<br>
up their freedoms in exchange for promised security.
<br>
<p>I recently read that a widely accepted definition of terrorism is &quot;the
<br>
deliberate use of force against civilians to achieve political goals.&quot;  I
<br>
don't make an exception for state terrorism.
<br>
<p>May 12, 1996: On &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; Lesley Stahl brought up the subject of the
<br>
effects of the U.S. led embargo on Iraq with then-Secretary of State
<br>
Madeleine Albright: &quot;We have heard that a half a million children have died.
<br>
I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. Is the price worth it?&quot;
<br>
Albright did not dispute the figure or the causality, but instead remarked:
<br>
&quot;.we think the price is worth it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Washington authorities have an often stated policy of no relief from
<br>
blockade as long as Saddam stays in power[3].
<br>
<p>How realistic or just is this policy of demanding that dictators get
<br>
themselves killed or at least thrown out of power (and then tried for &quot;war
<br>
crimes&quot;) and then starves the nations' innocent civilians on and on for
<br>
years while nothing changes?
<br>
<p>How convenient for our leaders that most talking heads on TV use their
<br>
dictionary. Hey, maybe it's just me, but I can't shake the notion that our
<br>
gov/media is pushing the view that when terrorists attack, they're
<br>
terrorizing. When we attack, we're retaliating. When they respond to our
<br>
retaliation with further attacks, they're terrorizing again. When we respond
<br>
with further attacks, we're retaliating again.
<br>
<p>Like &quot;collateral damage.&quot; I heard it first used by the Pentagon during the
<br>
Gulf War to describe the deaths of innocent Iraqis during the massive
<br>
bombing campaign in 1991 and it seemed like an attempt to obscure and
<br>
rationalize these deaths through Orwellian jargon. &quot;Collateral damage&quot; also
<br>
was invoked to describe the effects of attacks on civilian passenger trains,
<br>
refugee convoys and the headquarters of Radio Television Serbia during the
<br>
war in Kosovo.
<br>
<p>October 6, 1998: Denis Halliday, Assistant Secretary General of the UN, gave
<br>
a speech on Capitol Hill, citing a &quot;conservative estimate&quot; that Iraqi &quot;child
<br>
mortality for children under five years of age is from five to six thousand
<br>
per month.&quot; Halliday states: &quot;There are many reasons for these tragic and
<br>
unnecessary deaths, including the poor health of mothers, the breakdown of
<br>
health services, the poor nutritional intake of both adults and young
<br>
children and the high incidence of water-born diseases as a result of the
<br>
collapse of Iraq's water and sanitation system--and, of course, the lack of
<br>
electric power to drive that system, both crippled by war damage following
<br>
the 1991 Gulf War.&quot;
<br>
<p>6,000 children dead per month for 10 years, but I bet Saddam still eats
<br>
pretty good. Now there's a foreign policy to win friends and influence
<br>
people.  Half a million kids; that's like 1 or 2 WTC's a month.for 10 years.
<br>
Why would anyone hate us? Double America's current justifiable rage and
<br>
multiply by 10.  Does anyones calculator have that many digits?

[2] The Defense Science Board 1997 Summer Study Task Force on DoD Responses
<br>
to Transnational Threats, U.S. Dept. of Defense, October 1997, Vol 1, Final
<br>
Report,  p.15.
<br>
[3] May 20, 1991: President George Bush: &quot;At this juncture, my view is we
<br>
don't want to lift these sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.&quot;
<br>
James Baker, Secretary of State: &quot;We are not interested in seeing a
<br>
relaxation of sanctions as long as Saddam Hussein is in power.&quot;
<br>
March 26, 1997: Albright, in her first major foreign policy address as
<br>
Secretary of State: &quot;We do not agree with the nations who argue that if Iraq
<br>
complies with its obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction,
<br>
sanctions should be lifted. As Secretary of State, I have to deal in the
<br>
realm of reality and probability. And the evidence is overwhelming that
<br>
Saddam Hussein's intentions will never be peaceful.&quot;
<br>
November 7, 1997: Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz: &quot;The American
<br>
government says openly, clearly, that it's not going to endorse lifting the
<br>
sanctions on Iraq unless the leadership of Iraq is changed.&quot;
