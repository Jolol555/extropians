<em>&gt; The only way I see is by meme warfare.  But this is admittedly an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excrutiatingly slow way to wipe out theism.  Particularly since religions

<p>Neuroscientists Map 'God Module'
<br>
<a href="http://www.catalaw.com/detox/reverse/10.shtml">http://www.catalaw.com/detox/reverse/10.shtml</a>
<br>
Baltimore, MD -- A team of neuroscientists based at Johns Hopkins University
<br>
has announced successful completion of a study designed to investigate the
<br>
operation of theism, a mysterious and often misunderstood mental aberration
<br>
unique to the human species and afflicting a large percentage of its
<br>
population.
<br>
<p>Building on the discovery last year of a so-called 'god module' in the human
<br>
brain, Dr. Cyrus Naptik led the team. &quot;The god module hypothesis was very
<br>
exciting since it presented us with a direction for our research,&quot; he
<br>
explained. &quot;We are trying to delineate the intellectual gymnastics required of
<br>
people who suffer from theism yet still use common sense in other areas of
<br>
their lives.&quot;
<br>
<p>The progress of previous research was hampered by scientists' lack of
<br>
knowledge of any distinct locus of theistic neurological activity. The god
<br>
module provided the focus for the latest study, which mapped its behaviour to
<br>
decipher the operation of theist brains.
<br>
<p>'Logic' of Theism Uncovered
<br>
Early on, Dr. Naptik's team realized that the module is &quot;a brain within a
<br>
brain,&quot; with its own memory center (dogma) and reasoning system (faith). They
<br>
painstakingly waded through the detritus of dogma and faith to extract the
<br>
fundamental pseudo-logical rules that control the functioning of the god
<br>
module and thus the theist brain.
<br>
<p>Four rules were identified:
<br>
<p>Everything inside the module is true.
<br>
In case of contradiction inside the module, apply rule #1. Be creative.
<br>
In case of contradiction between something inside the module and something
<br>
outside the module, apply rule #1. Be creative.
<br>
If the contents of the module are irrelevant to an issue outside the module
<br>
(according to rules determined inside the module), apply a different set of
<br>
rules to the issue. Do not use these different rules inside the module.
<br>
The god module acts as a gatekeeper to the conscious thought of the host
<br>
brain, eventually conditioning it to comply unconsciously, too.
<br>
<p>The researchers were initially self-congratulatory upon formulating the four
<br>
rules, but unanswered questions remained. For example, all but the most
<br>
advanced theists studied were stumped during examination and assessment of
<br>
their god module-enhanced creativity. Obviously, &quot;Be creative&quot; was not
<br>
included in their rule-set.
<br>
<p>Module Types: Client, Server and Command
<br>
The theory required modification to account for this and other anomalies. A
<br>
hierarchical model was proposed. Now the dominant theory of theism, it
<br>
includes three primary types of god module.
<br>
<p>The original four rules are ascribed to only the rarest and most powerful, the
<br>
command module. Subservient to it is the more common server module, in which
<br>
&quot;Be creative&quot; is replaced by &quot;Consult command module.&quot; Most common, and lowest
<br>
in the hierarchy, is the client module, which instructs the host brain to
<br>
&quot;Consult server module&quot; when faced with contradiction.
<br>
<p>The affliction of theism, understood in this way, adapts to conceptual
<br>
opposition by propagating creative interpretations of dogma and contortions of
<br>
faith. They originate in a command version of the brain's god module, proceed
<br>
to the server modules and, finally, to the highly deferential client modules.
<br>
<p>The study found some people in whom the area of the brain occupied by the god
<br>
module was not commandeered by theism. Either it was never infected, or it had
<br>
been purged of the malicious meme by the only known cure: doubt. The
<br>
neurological resources in the area were free to be used seamlessly with the
<br>
rest of their brains.
<br>
<p>&quot;The fact that these individuals are called non-theists,&quot; Dr. Naptik said,
<br>
&quot;indicates just how common theism has become. We suggest that it is more
<br>
appropriate to call them healthy.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
