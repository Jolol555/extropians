<p>
I have to confess, some of the discussion on Extropians these days is
<br>
making me feel sick to my stomach.  It is enough to make me seriously
<br>
consider leaving, possibly for good, or until someone else informs me that
<br>
the list has made a recovery.  If Extropy and ExI takes a serious hit from
<br>
the xenophobia now being tossed about on the mailing list in the name of
<br>
free speech, don't say I didn't warn you, because transhumanists in
<br>
general *are* being held responsible for what gets said in these public
<br>
forums.  I am sick and tired of hearing about how transhumanism (or even
<br>
the Singularity!) is a form of Social Darwinism in which the slow runners
<br>
are forced out of the race, but after watching the debate on the list
<br>
these past months, I can see why the idea keeps popping up.  I'm writing
<br>
this message in the hopes that those who have joined the list only
<br>
recently can get a taste of what transhumanism is really about - that the
<br>
ideas now being expressed don't represent the majority opinion, but only
<br>
the opinions of those posters who are *still* posting, instead of having
<br>
given up months ago.
<br>
<p>As the child of two science fiction readers, I grew up reading books that
<br>
preached peace and tolerance toward other life forms, whether they had
<br>
hands or tentacles, whether they breathed oxygen or liquid helium, as long
<br>
as they were sentient.  Tolerance toward other *human* countries was so
<br>
obvious that it rarely even needed to be stated explicitly.  Where there
<br>
were group conflicts, the good guys were generally &quot;humanity&quot; - although
<br>
sometimes it was humanity that was in the wrong, and if so (the books
<br>
said) a real good guy would still be sure to fight on the side of right,
<br>
even against their own species.
<br>
<p>Unnoticed in these dramas of good against evil was the implicit notion of
<br>
one species, one faction.  The unity of humanity was taken for granted;
<br>
what the books tried to teach was tolerance of *aliens*.  Or at least that
<br>
was the way I saw it when I was, oh, nine years old or thereabouts.  Today
<br>
I have a more detailed view of science fiction, and yes, I can see that
<br>
some of it implicitly accepts the idea of human factions by preaching that
<br>
human factions ought to be nice to each other - but I still think that the
<br>
best argument of all is the one my ears heard initially, that humanity is
<br>
really one world, one species, one faction, all in the same boat,
<br>
regardless of whatever short-term arguments currently plague the world.
<br>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, this is part of what transhumanism is all about. 
<br>
If we can learn that uploads and AIs and augmented humans are on our side,
<br>
then it implies - as a simple, even overlooked corollary, which is much
<br>
better than explicit preaching - that all humans must be on the same side
<br>
as well.
<br>
<p>Only the most clueless of Singularity gradualists, in severe hard takeoff
<br>
denial, could even begin to imagine that the Singularity was an argument
<br>
for Social Darwinism; it is cluelessness of the same order as arguing that
<br>
the Singularity concept leads to passivity.  If the value of the whole
<br>
world is a quadrillion dollars, and a quintillion dollars of new wealth is
<br>
created by an egalitarian superintelligence, the previous distribution of
<br>
wealth becomes irrelevant; ripples erased by a tidal wave.  *Any* wealth
<br>
created by a Friendly AI, or created by an altruistic egalitarian
<br>
transhuman such as a transcended Eliezer or Samantha, is an equalizing
<br>
force that smoothes over or completely wipes out the old divisions between
<br>
humans.  The Singularity meme is a psychological force that mediates
<br>
against any form of prejudice by showing that all inequalities are
<br>
temporary, even genuine inequalities; it doesn't matter who has an IQ of
<br>
130 and who has an IQ of 90 today, if both can cooperate to have an IQ of
<br>
180 in a few years.  And the *real* Singularity is a fundamentally
<br>
egalitarian force because I expect the Singularity to completely ignore
<br>
the faction fights that humans spend so much time pursuing.  Nor does gray
<br>
goo respect national boundaries.  We win together, or lose together.  We
<br>
are all in the same boat.
<br>
<p>There are no &quot;Indians&quot;.  There are no &quot;Afghani&quot;.  There are only humans. 
<br>
Transhumanism, and Singularitarianism, are basically egalitarian
<br>
philosophies, because they permit the analysis of cosmic perspectives, and
<br>
when you look through a cosmic perspective the modern-day divisions
<br>
between humans become absurd.  There is no reason why the happiness of an
<br>
American computer programmer should weigh more in my calculations than the
<br>
happiness of an Indian computer programmer.  They are both the same kind
<br>
of entity.  They are both evolved biological organisms.  There is no
<br>
reason why one would have any greater intrinsic worth than the other. 
<br>
Humans may spend most of their day dividing into factions and fighting,
<br>
but that doesn't mean the factions are real, it just means that most
<br>
people sadly lack the perspective of species-wide unity which is provided
<br>
by thinking about transhumanity and uploads and AI.
<br>
<p>Well, that's what it's really about.  I think it'd be nice if everyone who
<br>
agrees with this reasoning posts a &quot;Me too!&quot;, and everyone who disagrees
<br>
with the argument but agrees with the conclusion posts a note saying that
<br>
as well.  The people who are new to the list need to see something to
<br>
outweigh some of the poisonous remarks that seem to be getting so much
<br>
airtime.  Of course I fear that most of the good guys in this battle may
<br>
have already gotten sick of the list and unsubscribed, so it may be too
<br>
late.  But for the record, I want to say that there was a time when I
<br>
would never have needed to post this message, and *that* is what
<br>
transhumanism is *really* about, no matter what happens to this mailing
<br>
list.
