Samantha asked:
<br>
<p>There is nothing wrong with the government forcefully prying
<br>
open my mind or yours on the least suspicion of wrong doing or
<br>
of withholding information it wishes to acquire?
<br>
<p>### If you do not respond to a policeman asking you to pull over, and insted
<br>
try to run away, he is usually allowed to use potentially damaging or even
<br>
in some cases deadly force to stop even if there is no other indication of
<br>
any wrongdoing on your part. Refusing to answer questions may be allowed by
<br>
the U.S. Constitution but then this is a document written two hundred years
<br>
ago and rather out-of-date in some respects. &quot;Prying open a mind&quot; was at
<br>
that time limited to torture or extortion and justly prohibited. Now, with
<br>
some perfectly safe and pleasant-to-use drugs (barbiturates) or even without
<br>
them, important questions can be answered, saving many lives. Why would an
<br>
honest person refuse to answer a legitimate question? This is so
<br>
inconceivable to me. As long as all the information becomes public within a
<br>
reasonable time, allowing public scrutiny of the officials involved (if
<br>
necessary, by narcoanalysis), there is hardly any risk of abuse for
<br>
totalitarian purposes.
<br>

 What could be
more a use of force than this?
<p>#### The rack, the Iron Maiden, a car chase. Narcoanalysis is not torture,
it's about as forceful as a urine test and you remember less.
<p>----
<p>  What happened to the 5th amendment? 
<p>### Should have never been written.
<p>----
<p>  What happened to privacy?
<p>### Hopefully will soon be a thing of the past.
<p>  What happened to the
sacrosanct individual?  All gone for a little more &quot;security&quot;.
<p>### The individual life is as sacrosanct as it gets and that's why we should
protect it by &quot;prying open minds&quot;, if necessary.
