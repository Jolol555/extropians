<em>&gt; &gt; You don't necessarily lose an argument by using an ad hominem.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just can't really win an argument with an ad hominem.  The rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the argument may well stand on its own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes, as in this case, an attack on an opponent's character rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by an answer to the contentions made is justified because this particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponent can put so much that's wrong into so small a space, and do it in such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way that it takes ten times (or more) that space to explain carefully just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how wrong it all is. No wonder it's the most favored debating tactic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologues. They do it deliberately to try to impose the greatest burden of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasted time, energy, and effort on their opponents, meanwhile making their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; malicious, emotionally loaded arguments to the ignorant. If one believes there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a such a thing as neurosis, and if one believes that they can make &quot;idiotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements,&quot; then such people surely are neurotic, if not quite &quot;blithering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idiots.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, since I assume you are indirectly choosing me as a
<br>
case in point, you are being quite paranoid.  I simply express
<br>
the way I see the situation at the moment as best I can.  I may
<br>
be any mix of right, wrong, muddle-headed, clear-headed and so
<br>
on but one thing I am not doing, never have done and never will
<br>
do is being manipulative and attempting to waste other's time to
<br>
counter what I say.  I highly resent the bald assertion that I
<br>
am doing any such thing.  I will not defend against it since it
<br>
is baseless.  I don't want to put you in the position of
<br>
defending such baseless nonsense either.
