<em>&gt; Samantha, please explain to me WHAT it takes to qualify as the epitome of evil in your mind??  I would really like to know!  I think a person need only commit one vicious murder or rape to enter epitome of evil status.

<p>Actually, I don't hold such a category as &quot;epitome of evil&quot; as
<br>
being a terribly useful construct in most circumstances.

I also wonder why calling American foreign policy evil presumably has a point as you say it or imply it in nearly ever line you write, this in spite of the fact that they haven't crashed a civilian airliner into a civilian skyscraper recently.

<em>&gt; Samantha, were you a lawyer, even the ACLU would find you too liberal!!  I think of you as a caring, but very naive person.  I respect that you want to go to the wall for civil rights, but see you as misguided.

<p>I am gratified to have your opinion.  However, the Taliban
<br>
themselves didn't attack us.  And it is less than just, imho, to
<br>
act as if they are exactly as guilty as those who did.

<em>&gt; &gt;Abetting murder is a crime in every civilized &gt;country I'm aware of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I must agree there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Abetting requires clear proof.  Not simple accusation.  And even
<br>
then it would be unjust to claim that every member of a group,
<br>
some of whom, allegedly abetted such an action, are all guilty
<br>
of doing so.
