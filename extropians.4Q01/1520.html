Eric quoted:
<br>
<p>His, point is that there are no interests of society which are different
<br>
from the interests of individuals.  There is no society at
<br>
all without individuals.  I have often pointed out that society is only a
<br>
collection of individuals.
<br>
<p>### I wouldn't agree with the claim that the society is just a collection of
<br>
individuals anymore than say that my body is just a collection of cells. In
<br>
fact, I could imagine changing my body as well as parts of my mind and still
<br>
maintain my personal identity. I could get rid of all my so selfish genes by
<br>
uploading and continue my existence. Similarly, a sufficiently developed
<br>
human society could get rid of all its starting components, substituting for
<br>
them minds designed to function and survive only within the society. Such
<br>
specialized entities would not have their own, independent survival
<br>
instincts and would be wholly and consciously devoted to the survival of the
<br>
society. Just like the skin cells on my feet are not slaves of the neurons
<br>
in my brain but rather co-workers in a common undertaking (putting their
<br>
genes through to the next generation), the minds making up the supersociety
<br>
would not be the oppressed, externally controlled or deceived victims of a
<br>
tyranny. They would be supremely conscious of their situation and would be
<br>
designed to be earnestly willing to perform their duties. At least I think
<br>
so - I would find it hard to imagine that the only general intelligence you
<br>
can build needs to have motivational mechanisms similar to ours, primarily
<br>
focused on individual survival.
<br>
<p>We, humans are somewhat similar to slime molds (as mentioned on the site
<br>
being referred to) because we can and usually are willing to survive outside
<br>
of our initial cultural environments. The cells of our bodies are fully
<br>
committed to the welfare of the whole body, and, just think about how much
<br>
more than slime molds can these cells achieve. 
<br>
<p>As Anders mentioned earlier, the universe does not care about our wishes. It
<br>
is possible that the transhuman form of consciousness best adapted to
<br>
survive over long periods of time might be the supersociety rather than the
<br>
society of free individuals as we know them. The supersociety is not morally
<br>
superior and has no more of an idependent claim to existence than we or
<br>
slime molds have but it could work so much better as to make us obsolete.
<br>
<p>If this is true, then only the cosmic equivalents of rotting logs would
<br>
offer ecological niches for individualistic transhumans.
