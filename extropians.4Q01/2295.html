Wei Dai offered some comments on the differences between &quot;moral
<br>
relativism&quot; and &quot;moral equivalidity&quot;, concluding with:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many ways to break the apparent symmetry between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moralities. My personal favorite is to use the indexical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that I am me, and simply accept my own moral system as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privileged above all others.
</em><br>
<p>I think it may also be argued that one may also distinguish based
<br>
on the &quot;purpose&quot; for which the system was created.  This goes back
<br>
to the Burch-Bradbury debate on whether or not you can eliminate
<br>
the substrate on which your copies run.
<br>
<p>I suspect that the Sandberg-Burch camp would argue that conscious
<br>
entitites that are moral actors have an inherent set of rights
<br>
which extend up to the point where actions infringe on the rights
<br>
of other moral actors.
<br>
<p>However for me to &quot;hold&quot; the logical contradiction that I consider
<br>
it to be &quot;moral&quot; to create and use laboratory mice for medical
<br>
research purposes but &quot;immoral&quot; to allow ones cat outside where
<br>
its raison-d'etre is to non-painlessly kill mice that do not
<br>
normally interfere with my rights I have to look at the &quot;purpose&quot;
<br>
for which the mice were created.  (Others might argue that mice
<br>
are not conscious moral actors and so they have no rights, but
<br>
I suspect that the range of rights that specific actors *should*
<br>
have is much more continuous spectrum than we currently grant
<br>
because of our currently limited understanding of consciousness).
<br>
<p>The fact that I may construct simulation hardware, create copies
<br>
that run on it and terminate the simulation when I've obtained
<br>
the desired results of the experiment seems moral to me.  I
<br>
suspect that to Anders &amp; Greg this is immoral because my
<br>
equivalent selves obtain equivalent moral actor status the
<br>
second I've started them running.
<br>
<p>It seems that the only logical way out of this is that once
<br>
you discover you are running in a simulation you accept the
<br>
fact that your moral actor rights are subject to the rights
<br>
of the simulation creator.  I.e. the simulation creator's
<br>
moral system supercedes your own.
