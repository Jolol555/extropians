<em>&gt; Amara Graps wrote:  Dear Extropes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I returned to Heidelberg 1.5 days ago from my business/personal trip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the U.S., and since this was my first trip back 'home' to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. since September 11, I am compelled to note my observations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the U.S. appears to me these days.
</em><br>
<p>This post had more impact on me than perhaps any other one
<br>
since the attacks.  Herein I share a few thoughts on the matter,
<br>
not necessarily debating, but making observations as Amara
<br>
has done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, for those of you women who have upcoming travels: it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that women traveling alone are a red flag for U.S. airport security...
</em><br>
<p>My wife confirms this.  We went to Florida at Thanksgiving, then
<br>
I had to go to New York on travel while she returned to Taxifornia
<br>
alone.  In the Orlando airport she was &quot;randomly&quot; selected and
<br>
searched *four times*.  They unpacked all the luggage, twice, then
<br>
got all proctological with the metal detector at each of the checkpoints.
<br>
<p>Let us ask why this is happening.  One must wonder what has become
<br>
of the security crews that were on duty the morning of the attacks,
<br>
specifically those who realized their failure to detect the weapons resulted
<br>
<p>in the loss of thousands of lives.  Have any of these taken their own
<br>
lives?  Would not their quality of life approach zero?  One must
<br>
understand that every airport security crew in the world will now
<br>
go to extraordinary measures to not become the next person who
<br>
must live with that dreadful burden for the rest of his or her life.
<br>
<p>Terrorists might imagine the next attempt at using an airliner for a
<br>
guided missile would require a woman, preferably a fair-haired
<br>
blue-eyed one, to carry the weapons on board, reasoning that
<br>
Jihad Barbie has a greater chance of actually getting the arsenal
<br>
past the guards.
<br>
<p>Thus, the security crews might be extra careful scrutinizing a
<br>
woman traveling alone.  Thoughts?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or sometimes I got the impression that the flags were more like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashionable trend.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  No argument at all there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (&quot;Universe Bless the Milky Way&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>Roger that.  Everything we are, every atom, very nearly every photon
<br>
that reaches our eye originated in the Milky Way, and will likely always
<br>
be so.  I want a flag with a single spiral galaxy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I was living [in the states], I would find it very difficult to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative peaceful solutions to the 'War' with the media hammering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away as it is.
</em><br>
<p>The news media play that which sells.  Thank the universe for the
<br>
off switch.
<br>
<p>Suppose you could isolate yourself from the hammering media.  Would
<br>
you still have difficulty thinking of alternative peaceful solutions to the
<br>
war?  My notion is that we have insufficient technology to do much
<br>
else besides what is currently being done.
<br>
<p>I have a vision of what future weapons will be like.  These might not
<br>
even be recognizable as weapons, at least not in the sense that we
<br>
know weapons today.  They would not hurl chunks of metal the
<br>
way our current primitive weapons do.  Extrapolate the trends from
<br>
the last half century in technology.  Imagine advanced weapons that
<br>
would not destroy property, nor even lives.  Sufficiently advanced
<br>
weaponry would not even cause physical injury.  They would,
<br>
however destroy certain memes.  Sufficiently advanced weaponry
<br>
would destroy the memes that motivate the Taliban to do the
<br>
inhuman acts they carried out on such a massive scale.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately we currently do not have sufficiently advanced weapons.
<br>
Let us develop them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The means to generate funds to benefit those close to the September 11
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victims appears to be taken to new levels I've not seen before: product
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labels carrying elements of the September 11 events...commercialization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too... slick. Like selling cars. I would rather grieve about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; September 11, losses without the commercialization.
</em><br>
<p>As would we all.  But the government has nothing to say to business
<br>
about how they sell their products.  This is anarcho-capitalism at work.
<br>
Crass as it is, I would have it no other way, for I know of no other
<br>
way that would work as well, nor any other way which would work
<br>
under the sacred first amendment of the US constitution.  Do you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, I observed a transformation in America, that frankly scared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me. It's there now, and is trickling outside. Fear, suspicions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes paranoia.
</em><br>
<p>Bin Laden has quoted a verse in the Koran which says &quot;...Fight
<br>
them [the infidels] until they confess that there is no God but Allah...&quot;
<br>
<p>I will not say that.  I know many here who will not say that.
<br>
Amara, I suspect that neither you nor Samantha nor Anders
<br>
nor Damien nor any of the others here will give in to this
<br>
religious tyranny.  Even if we did say it, they would know
<br>
we were lying.  This nation cannot be ruled by the koran.
<br>
<p>The Taliban seem to have a special hatred for the US, however
<br>
they also consider all of Europe as the home of infidels.  Guided
<br>
by the words of Mohammed, they would fight there as well, until
<br>
every European confesses that there is no god but allah.  Europe
<br>
cannot be ruled by the koran.  Asia cannot be ruled by a koran-
<br>
inspired tyrant.
<br>
<p>Given that we have no advanced meme-destroying weaponry,
<br>
we are stuck with the ancient technique of destroying the
<br>
meme carrier.  The evidence is sufficient: OBL and his minions
<br>
hate us, they want us dead.  We want us alive.  I am open to
<br>
suggestion here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...I couldn't escape the feeling that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place where I was born and lived for most of my life (the U.S.) has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone a little bit insane.
</em><br>
<p>Granted.  This is what happens in war.  War is a crime.  We hate
<br>
all war and wish to end it.  Ideally all killing should end.  How?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Before I moved out of the U.S. ~4 years ago, I was, in a small way, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pacifist, believing that one doesn't answer violence with yet again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more violence.
</em><br>
<p>Again, we are open to suggestion.  Appeasement will not
<br>
stop the violence.  This planet will not be ruled by the koran.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also believe that any group's rampant unhappiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or disrest has an element of truth embedded, and it must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressed in a civil way...
</em><br>
<p>...Short or worshipping allah or wearing beards/burqas please.
<br>
<p>Honestly, we cannot stop our culture from invading theirs, for
<br>
we cannot stop radio waves.  Our government does not control
<br>
business, it does not control Hollywood Incorporated.  The
<br>
US government cannot be held responsible for that which our
<br>
own first amendment prevents it from controlling.
<br>
<p>The Taliban hate the infidel because they know their own people
<br>
will choose the ways of the infidel over the ways of allah,
<br>
*if given the freedom to choose*.  If their people can pick up
<br>
Baywatch, they will do so.  The reprehensible Taliban fights
<br>
by destroying freedom, in order to preserve their deplorable
<br>
memes.  If you can think of a way to destroy those memes,
<br>
without destroying the meme carriers, we are open to suggestion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...or the violent cycle will continue.
</em><br>
<p>I have no doubts there will be more terrorism.  Our infrastructure
<br>
is still very vulnerable, especially airlines and roads.  We need
<br>
better technology for discovering and preventing such attacks.
<br>
That is something every pacifist will support.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The events since September 11, and my U.S. observations the last weeks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have polarized me (unexpectedly) much more as a pacifist, and I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now that the U.S. is not a good fit as an environment for me to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or to raise a kid).
</em><br>
<p>Our loss is great.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know if my observations are useful to anyone in the U.S. and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I won't entertain arguments or debates, since they are mostly my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations. I'll only state that I'm very worried with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction that the U.S. humans (and others) on this planet are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following.  Amara
</em><br>
<p>As are we all.  But let us look at the positive for a minute.  Right
<br>
or wrong, the war will be over in a few days.  As I suspected, there
<br>
are masses of middle eastern infidels whose rights were crushed
<br>
under the Taliban.  These people are free now, or at least freer than
<br>
they were.
<br>
<p>I am looking for something analogous to a capitalist/feminist
<br>
revolution to sweep over the Arab world, which will revolutionize
<br>
their society in a much more fundamental way than did the cultural
<br>
revolution of the 1960s here.  I foresee a backlash against any
<br>
form of religious compulsion.  Middle eastern countries may write
<br>
some form of a first amendment into their own governmental
<br>
constitutions.  I believe we need the meme of universal freedom
<br>
of conscience before we have any chance at world peace.  We
<br>
can all work towards that goal, regardless of where on this
<br>
planet we choose to live.  spike
