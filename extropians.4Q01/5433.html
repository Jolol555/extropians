<p><em>&gt; The only basis for coercion is the need to protect innocent life-wish,

</em><br>
<p>You encouraged me to:
<br>
<p>Fire away!
<br>
<p>### OK, here we are:
<br>
<p>Above all I wish to survive. It's nice to be free, have a good standard of
<br>
living, but what really counts for me is my survival. The only criterion I
<br>
use to evaluate a society is it's ability to enhance my long-term survival.
<br>
At first pass of the analysis it doesn't matter how, only the results count.
<br>
<p>That's why the optimal political system for me would, conditionally, be a
<br>
theocracy, or absolute tyranny - with the condition of me being the deity,
<br>
or maybe just an emperor. However, since it would be unrealistic to expect
<br>
others to share my vision, I have to direct my attention to systems that
<br>
could be accepted by a sufficient number of persons to make them viable,
<br>
while still affording good chances for my personal survival.
<br>
<p>Such system would have to be based on shared, or compatible, individual
<br>
wishes. The idea of reciprocity is strongly embedded in our collective
<br>
cognitive framework, so the society has to incorporate this idea as well.
<br>
So, in the second pass of analysis, I have to give a sincere consideration
<br>
to other person's needs, if I want my wishes to be respected.
<br>
<p>As far as I know, for the vast majority of adult humans, including me, there
<br>
are three absolutely basic needs - life, truth, and freedom.
<br>
<p>We want to live, we are very upset about being lied to or manipulated
<br>
(because under the natural conditions of evolution, those who were too
<br>
easily lied to, tended to die early), and we really dislike being forced to
<br>
do something against our will (restricting our freedom of choice), because
<br>
under natural conditions of evolution... you know what.
<br>
<p>A successful society has to allow maximum expression of these three wishes.
<br>
Additionally, the rule of reciprocity absolves us from having to respect the
<br>
wishes of those who disrespect ours. It makes sense - you do not improve
<br>
your survival chances by helping somebody who wouldn't help you if the roles
<br>
were reversed. We can then add a limiting clause to our three main
<br>
commandments - it is &quot;innocent&quot; life, truth, and freedom wish that must be
<br>
respected. Innocent in the first commandment sense is a person who never
<br>
killed, or tried to kill an innocent person. Similarly with the other
<br>
commandments. The current full formulation of my moral commandments is as
<br>
follows:
<br>
<p>1) The innocent person's wish to remain alive (shall not be thwarted/must be
<br>
upheld)
<br>
2) The truth shall not be denied (= you may not lie, except if absolutely
<br>
unavoidable to comply with the First Commandment)
<br>
3) The freedom to do as you wish shall not be abridged (physically limited
<br>
by a premeditated action of an entity), except to uphold 1 and 2.
<br>
<p>I derive essentially all my opinions about politics from these three rules,
<br>
or as Eliezer might say, the supergoals, aided by scientific epistemology.
<br>
<p>The hierarchy of the three commandments(3C) is not strict - life without
<br>
freedom isn't worth living, and without truth it tends to be short anyway.
<br>
Etc.
<br>
<p>All other moral values are either derivable from the 3C, or invalid. The
<br>
right to own property, of free speech, to carry a firearm, even the idea of
<br>
justice, fairness, and duties - all are only elaborations of the basic 3C.
<br>
Some ideas, like &quot;Pacta servanda sunt&quot;, are moral heuristics derivable from
<br>
3C through careful observation of their impact in real-life situations.
<br>
<p>So much for an introduction. Now let's try to put coercion and violence in
<br>
this context.
<br>
<p>Coercion is the use of a threat of death (against C1), or bodily harm
<br>
(usually against C3). From C1 it follows that the first type of coercion may
<br>
only be used against non-innocent humans, or against humans who previously
<br>
agreed to be coerced, thus relinquishing their life-wish. You may kill a
<br>
killer or somebody trying to kill you, if you are innocent. You may execute
<br>
a person reneging on a contract, if such contract contained a clause
<br>
allowing it, as in some military situations. You may not intend to kill an
<br>
innocent person to save your own life - because thus you are no longer
<br>
innocent. You may kill an innocent person if it is absolutely necessary to
<br>
save at least two other persons, because refraining from such action would
<br>
thwart a person's life-wish.
<br>
<p>Why are taxes sometimes morally acceptable?
<br>
<p>There are some life-prolonging services which for technical reasons are
<br>
difficult to provide on an individual basis, as in a free market. Military
<br>
defense usually requires maintaining control over a geographic area. It
<br>
would be difficult to provide this service to only a subset of the
<br>
inhabitants, especially if two or more groups would try to purchase such
<br>
service from different providers. Therefore, if innocent life is to be
<br>
protected from evil invaders, all inhabitants have to receive the service
<br>
from one provider. Now, those unwilling to accept and pay the local provider
<br>
may be forced to leave, or else financial support for the provider might be
<br>
insufficient, with more and more persons hoping to freeload, until defense
<br>
is impossible. 
<br>
<p>A very similar argument applies to the support of basic scientific research.
<br>
<p><p>So, if taxes are used to support necessary defense and research, they are
<br>
morally right, especially if the taxpayers have the option of leaving the
<br>
area in search of other providers.
<br>
<p>The whole argument is based on long-term survival prolongation, as verified
<br>
by empirical data. Taxation, or even initiation of violence, do not have
<br>
independent moral significance, they are only evaluated in the context of
<br>
the 3C. In general, the practical conclusions I draw from 3C are quite
<br>
similar to libertarianism but with a few important exceptions, some of which
<br>
I already mentioned.
<br>
<p>This grew into an excessively long post, so let me finish here.
