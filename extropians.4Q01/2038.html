&lt;&lt;Some countries that have poor solar resources, such as Japan, have very 
<br>
good
<br>
geothermal resources.  IIRC, Japan has already determined that 3% of their
<br>
land is suitable for cheap geothermal technologies with a total generational
<br>
capacity that is somewhere around 5-7 orders of magnitude greater than
<br>
current consumption in Japan.
<br>
<p>The U.S. is the Saudi Arabia of geothermal, having the worlds largest
<br>
high-grade geothermal resevoir (the region between the Rocky and the Sierra
<br>
Nevada mountains inclusive).  MIT has estimated that with conventional
<br>
technology, the geothermal generational capacity of the U.S. is ~3
<br>
Terawatts.  With cheap HDR geothermal, the geothermal capacity of the U.S.
<br>
is in the mid-Petawatt range.  Note that &quot;cheap HDR&quot; is typically defined as
<br>
an HDR resevoir that is 5km deep or less.  In most regions of the world, HDR
<br>
resevoirs are at least 7km deep and in some places, tens of kilometers down.
<br>
In the case of the U.S., it is probably of some value that among the best
<br>
places for solar power harvesting are also the best places for geothermal
<br>
harvesting.
<br>
<p>Cheers,&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;Excellent email. We need to go to Hot Rock Geothermal, despite its cost to 
<br>
drill extremely, deep; it gives us an alternative source then Nuclear Fusion 
<br>
which never seems to arrive. We can use HDR Geothermal to make hydrogen, 
<br>
methane, hydrane, methanol, ethanol, or even gasoline to propel vehicles. The 
<br>
economics of HDR georthermal is not certain for fuels, but eventually.
