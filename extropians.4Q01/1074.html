<em>&gt;the &quot;Law&quot; this is a social convenience and is interpreted for

<p><em>&gt;I suggest to you that your notion of &quot;law&quot; (so-called) is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>As a games programmer (and organiser of the World
<br>
Chaturanga Championships) I see RULES as essential.
<br>
In fact games are defined by having rules that are agreed
<br>
amongst the players .... otherwise the games couldn't be
<br>
played and we wouln't have any fun! 
<br>
<p>Laws fortunately are not &quot;set in stone;&quot; unless you 
<br>
happen to believe in the Ten Commandments or Islamic
<br>
Sharia ... so are negotiable amongst &quot;players&quot; in any
<br>
democratic societies. If you absolutely can't live with 
<br>
them, (1) find a country with Laws that suit you better,
<br>
(2) go live in the desert by yourself, or (3) try to get the
<br>
Laws changed, maybe by joining the Posthuman.Org 
<br>
global electoral struggle?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As long as you hallucinate some of the noises and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scribbles emanating from the mouths and pens of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*human political cheaters* as &quot;the law&quot; (so-called),
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Baptists, Islam &amp;c.
</em><br>
<p>True, all internal dialogue is auditory hallucination. So what!
<br>
If we were all fully enlightened beings their would be 
<br>
no need for codification of behaviour patterns, but until
<br>
then I would prefer to see homocidal maniacs &amp;c. 
<br>
locked up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As long as you think in terms of &quot;changing various Laws,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I will consider you *in this respect* to be engaging in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human politics at the same primitive/backward level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as the Vatican, Mormons, Baptists, Islam &amp;c.
</em><br>
<p>So you are a complete nihilist and want any type of
<br>
behaviour to be allowed? What about property law?
<br>
How would business function without commercial
<br>
agreements? Sure, it needs reform .... maybe AI
<br>
expert-system judges to replace or augment humanoids.
<br>
<p>ADVANCE!
