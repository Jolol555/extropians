<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; At the very least I must say that the evidence your average medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ethicist is significantly more virtuous  than I am is somewhat less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; than compelling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; An ad hominem for all seasons.;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Attacking a _profession_ is fair game, because people choose their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; professions, and are therefore rightly judged by those choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A medical ethicist is someone who has willfully chosen as a profession
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to increase death and suffering in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Generally an ad hominen argument is considered to be an illegitimate form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument because it fails to provide the right sort of evidential relation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between premise(s) and conclusion. John claimed the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot; I have never, absolutely never, heard a medical ethicist say anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be put in one of 2 categories:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A) Wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B) Bloody obvious.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let us suppose that John's claim about their level of virtue is correct. How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does this provide evidential support for believing that everything they say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be put into one of either two categories? Suppose it turns out that both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aristotle and Kant were a couple of dog-kicking baby-punching immoral pricks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in practice. Would this in itself constitute a refutation of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical writings on ethics?
</em><br>
<p>It is disengenuous to expand the definition of ad hominem to attacks on
<br>
an entire profession, for there are many circumstances that anyone can
<br>
think of where such attacks are entirely warranted and are supported by
<br>
the facts. For example:
<br>
<p>&quot;I have never, absolutely never, heard a politician say anything that is
<br>
not either a) a lie, or b) bloody obvious.&quot;
<br>
<p>or (worried about invoking Godwin's Law):
<br>
<p>&quot;I have never, absolutely never, heard of a Nazi do or say anything that
<br>
was not either a) stupid or b) evil.&quot;
<br>
<p>Saying it in this way also leaves open the possibility that the accused
<br>
group may have individuals who may have said or done something outside
<br>
these possibilities when out of the speakers sight or hearing. It is not
<br>
an absolutist statement. A truely absolutist statement that would be ad
<br>
hominem would be to say: &quot;Medical ethicists NEVER say anything which is
<br>
not either wrong or bloody obvious.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, so far as 'medical ethicists' are concerned, I have heard many in
<br>
the medical profession refer to them as the &quot;superstition liason
<br>
officers&quot;.
