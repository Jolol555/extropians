<p>There is an interesting chapter in Rhode's Making of the
<br>
Atomic Bomb where Oppenheimer is doing some soul
<br>
searching during the test phase.  He realizes the atom
<br>
bomb is a lousy weapon, for many of the same reasons
<br>
bioweapons fail, assuming one is making war for some
<br>
specific political aim.
<br>
<p>Bioweapons are the terrorists dream come true however;
<br>
they are cheap and perfect for accomplishing the clearly
<br>
stated goal of the terrorists, i.e. to slay as many people as
<br>
humanly possible, and keep doing so until all infidels and
<br>
unbelievers are dead.
<br>
<p>Oppie realized that the nuke would give the U.S. a short
<br>
term advantage, but in the long run would actually be
<br>
disadvantageous, since it would tend to neutralize the
<br>
edge we had enjoyed for so long, isolation by oceans
<br>
and a political infrastructure that encourages people to get
<br>
out and go to work every day, resulting in a superior
<br>
manufacturing environment.  All those same arguments
<br>
apply even more to bioweapons.  spike
