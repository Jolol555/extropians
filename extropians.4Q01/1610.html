<p><em>&gt; Look at it from the other direction: the market was willing to cough

<em>&gt; where those people could download the songs themselves for near-zero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That means the mere convenience of getting it on a small disk that
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; their conscience that they are obeying present law, was worth $100M.
</em><br>
<p>Another thing they're paying for is circumventing latency. When Ani
<br>
DiFranco's Up-up-up-up-up-up came out, I bought the disk b/c I knew it
<br>
would take me forever to track down all the individual songs from it,
<br>
and I'd have to wait until they percolated out into Napsterland in the
<br>
first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's completely on top of what they get for live concerts, appearances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on television, endorsement deals, and other income not dependent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IP.  Anyone who argues that the age of downloading (which takes away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only the value of that conscience-stroking) will cause artists to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starve isn't doing the math.
</em><br>
<p>Let's stack the argument even more against voluntary payment. Let's
<br>
say that a cold 50% of those people were unaware that they could
<br>
download all the Dixie Chicks they wanted with almost no chance of
<br>
getting caught. That cuts DC's gross to $50 million. Let's say the
<br>
band makes 2% of that after all the 'little people' have their cut
<br>
ending up with a paltry $1 million. $333,000 and change per Dixie
<br>
Chick per year. I wouldn't quit my current (extropic) job to have
<br>
theirs, but I'd quit the one I had in Michigan in a hot minute.
<br>
<p>Of course, with such a business model in place, DC would take in
<br>
far more than 2%, since as pointed out by other posters, they could
<br>
tell their record label to take a hike and distribute their music
<br>
directly. Smaller pie, bigger slice.
