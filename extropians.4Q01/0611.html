<em>&gt; &gt; Science is a formalized tool that reflects a greater whole - for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the experimental method reflects (among other things) the Bayesian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Probability Theorem.  I don't need magic to know whether or not I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happy.  There's a certain subjective sensation I call happiness, and it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not exactly hard to tell whether it's present, and at what intensity, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In addition, since happiness correlates to serotonin and other neuromodulator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hormone levels, it can be measured scientifically. Other emotions correspond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to brain activity in specific regions. For example, love is coincident with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, middle insula, putamen, and caudate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nucleus. Consequently science can determine if one is in love by measuring the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intensity of activity in these regions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www4.cnn.com/2000/HEALTH/11/08/love.in.lights.ap/index.html">http://www4.cnn.com/2000/HEALTH/11/08/love.in.lights.ap/index.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>This is a serious oversimplification. If I saw a brain with activity in
<br>
those regions, I would say &quot;this is a strongly emotional brain state,
<br>
likely pleasurable and fairly complex&quot; - but I am pretty sure there are
<br>
many other mental states like that that would produce the same
<br>
activation pattern. Functional neuroimaging is still struggling to
<br>
become more than neophrenology. If a brain area is activated, that
<br>
merely tells you that this functionality is involved, not which function
<br>
of that functionality is active. If I could stimulate the above areas, I
<br>
would most likely get something far different from love (most likely a
<br>
kind of nausea experience with tremor) - what is required is stimulating
<br>
certain neural networks embedded within these regions, which we at
<br>
present cannot distinguish from the other networks dealing with other
<br>
emotions and actions. 
<br>
<p>Correlation is not equivalence: even if I with a high probability can
<br>
guess the right emotion from the activation pattern, that does not mean
<br>
the pattern *is* or corresponds to the emotion. It could simply be due
<br>
to a more subtle change somewhere else, causing both the emotion and the
<br>
pattern. 
<br>
<p>As an emotion-interested neuroscientist I think we will one day
<br>
understand emotions scientifically: how do they work, why do we have
<br>
them, how will they be affected by different interventions and maybe
<br>
how this ties in with the phenomenology of emotion. But today we
<br>
are far from being able to say things like &quot;happiness is serotonin&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In further support of your comments, I'd add that since intelligence impels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific methodology, intelligence may also decide when such methodology is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessary to solve lesser problems.
</em><br>
<p>Science was &quot;invented&quot; roughly 400 years ago. But we have had largely
<br>
the same intelligence for several hundred thousand years before that. So
<br>
I would disagree that intelligence impels science - science-like
<br>
thinking is part of intelligence, but turning it into an effective
<br>
system of thought is something else. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Nothing beats science...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What a great slogan! Would make a nice bumper sticker.
</em><br>
<p>As an empiricist and Popper fan, I would say: Nothing beats science yet.
