Mike Darwin wrote what was for me some very touching comments on the new film Vanilla Sky.  I was happy to to see that for him the film was a sign his life's work has had an effect on the world around him. 
<br>
<p>The folks at Alcor were given an advance screening.  
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>

For those of you who are fans of Monet, Vanilla Sky is a great impressionist painting. It is also a complex and stunning movie about many things; what 
<br>
rock and roll has become (a broken guitar on a rich man's wall), where our deepest hopes and fears can leads us, and yes, it is about cryonics. 
<br>
<p>It is about Life Extension and Cryonics. This is without a doubt the first film that deals intelligently with the issues raised by cryonics. It is the first movie that captures the imagery created by cryonics technology (Alcor and Trans Time style) as filtered through the media.
<br>
<p>I will not spoil the plot for you. I will say that you may have to see this movie twice, or more, before you understand the complexities of its many 
<br>
levels of messages.
<br>
<p>Finally, I will tell you that it was very, very strange to see the world I have participated in creating in microcosm writ large, and now clearly a part of The Culture. My goal was to poison the cultural groundwater of this culture with cryonics. Vanilla Sky is the proof, at last, of my success.
