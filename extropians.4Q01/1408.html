<p>Having a reconfigurable language cortex would be great. 
<br>
<p>As a swede, I don't find the german verb splitting particularly
<br>
annoying. It is remembering the proper genus of all words which bothers
<br>
me - I think english does it right by ignoring it. On the other hand,
<br>
german and even more swedish have one feature which I think would be
<br>
useful in english: free word construction. In swedish it is completely
<br>
normal to put together prefixes and words into composite words:
<br>
tätningsbricketillverkningschef - grommet production chief :-) (and
<br>
that was just a short one). The benefit is that it is possible to
<br>
contruct new concepts as needed - sure, you can string together words in
<br>
english too using hyphens, but these are bona fide acceptable words and
<br>
far less contrieved (they also make writing swedish and german
<br>
spellcheckers tricky, since although the language itself has far fewer
<br>
words than english, they can be combined into a huge space of potential
<br>
correct words). 
<br>
<p>What I really want is good macros in language. And an extended
<br>
linguistic working memory so that more complex and evocative
<br>
sentences/concepts can be parsed with no risk for stack overflow. And
<br>
while we are at it, hypertext capabilities...
