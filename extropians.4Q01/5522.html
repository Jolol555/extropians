</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, agreed.  They provide the illusion of working - which, itself, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to stimulate the economy and do a bunch of other good things -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but as to what they were originally intended to do, they fall down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, most large corporations buy into the illusion enough that their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions are based on a belief that the laws work; if they think the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will protect them against all assaults, why invest in further defenses?
</em><br>
<p>Speaking as someone who deals with the internal workings of many
<br>
corporations, I'm of the following opinions:
<br>
<p>1) The system works for companies because a fairly predicatable cost can be
<br>
assigned to *initiating* legal action against another company, based on size
<br>
of company and a couple of other factors. As we all know, predictable costs
<br>
are a very good thing in markets.
<br>
<p>2) This cost can then be factored in whenever dealing with another company.
<br>
i.e. you know it's going to cost them X to start sueing you, so provided you
<br>
inconvenience them to a value &lt; X, you're probably fine. You try very hard
<br>
never put yourself in the position of possibly netting Y &gt;&gt; X for someone
<br>
who could sue you. My point being, it all factors in very easily.
<br>
<p>3) No C-level person I've ever spoken to believes that the laws work, but
<br>
all try very hard to propagate that illusion in public. This is no different
<br>
than all the normal illusions put out by companies with
<br>
investors/employees/etc to keep happy.
<br>
<p>So it's not really a matter of certainty in anything other than the costs
<br>
associated with conducting business by legal means.
<br>
<p>Personally, I'm very much in favor of eliminating almost all current laws
<br>
and advancing to a principals of power society (i.e. only three rules, all
<br>
of which pretty much boil down to no coercion, everyone is responsible for
<br>
the results of their own actions, do no harm) in which judges are assigned
<br>
at random from the local populance on a per-case basis, judgement is
<br>
completely subjective, precedent doesn't exist, and the penalty for repeat
<br>
offences is permanent exile. Of course, this would take a revolution and
<br>
probably a completely transparent society to put in place, but oh well. Add
<br>
it to the list of things I'd like that would take a revolution to put in
<br>
place.
<br>
<p>More reasonably, it would be nice to get rid of the laws that remove
<br>
personal responsibility for actions. All drug laws, all prevention laws.
<br>
Hmm, all corporate law. Never mind. Back to the previous paragraph very
<br>
quickly there. Is it just me, or is the vast body of Western law all there
<br>
to implicitly deny that people have any responsibility for their actions?
