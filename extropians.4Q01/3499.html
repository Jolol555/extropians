<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Pat Fallon&quot; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Some thoughts on the subject of terrorism, for what it's worth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I think it is very important to understand why we were attacked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Understanding why someone attacked you may help you avoid a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;similar situation in the future, for one thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;the rest of a long post distilled down to one sentence&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Give the terrorists what they want and they won't be terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anymore.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not going to happen.
</em><br>
<p>Not neccessarily. It's worth thinking about this from the viewpoint of
<br>
realpolitik/raison d'etat. If people attack you you need to know what their
<br>
beef is so you can calculate the relative cost of 1. Killing them, 2. giving
<br>
them what they want 3. giving them some of what they want but making it
<br>
clear that's all they're going to get. If giving your enemy what they want
<br>
is too costly (a threat to some vital interest or the existence of the
<br>
state) then you accept the cost of killing them. If the cost balance works
<br>
out the other way you make a deal - this is what the British government has
<br>
done with IRA/Sinn Fein.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We know what the terrorists want, and they are not going to get it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first thing they want is for us/U.S to stop supporting Israel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so they can try/fail again to destroy it, and that is not going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Why not ? Clearly Israel is not going to make a deal because it
<br>
(realistically) sees that as a threat to its existence (see above). However
<br>
you need to ask - is a threat to Israel a threat of equivalent severity to
<br>
the national interest of the United States ? If it is then how is it ? I can
<br>
see a case for arguing that the loss of the oil under Saudi would be a
<br>
devastating blow to U.S. interests but doesn't supporting Israel make that
<br>
outcome more likely ? (My own view is that the House of Saud is past its
<br>
sell-by date and won't survive much longer. Raison d'etat would lead the
<br>
U.S. to support the regime for as long as possible, say for 8-10 years,
<br>
while sorting alternative sources of energy). The point is the world is
<br>
probably safer if people act on the basis of The Prince rather than
<br>
moralistic arguments. Steve Davies
