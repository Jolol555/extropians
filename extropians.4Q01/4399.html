<em>&gt; Let us ask why this is happening.  One must wonder what has become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the security crews that were on duty the morning of the attacks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically those who realized their failure to detect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons resulted
</em><br>
<p>Nobody snuck weapons on board the planes.  The previous rules allowed small
<br>
knives to be taken aboard.  We have no idea if these were detected and OK'd
<br>
by security.  Even if personnel followed all security procedures perfectly,
<br>
it wouldn't have mattered.  The failure was in security design, not security
<br>
implementation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Have any of these taken their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives?  Would not their quality of life approach zero?  One must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand that every airport security crew in the world will now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go to extraordinary measures to not become the next person who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must live with that dreadful burden for the rest of his or her life.
</em><br>
<p>The security crews were following instructions before the attacks, and they
<br>
are following instructions now.  The instructions have changed due to
<br>
heightened security rules.  You don't have to look for psychological or
<br>
motivational reasons for these changes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Terrorists might imagine the next attempt at using an airliner for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guided missile would require a woman, preferably a fair-haired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blue-eyed one, to carry the weapons on board, reasoning that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jihad Barbie has a greater chance of actually getting the arsenal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past the guards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, the security crews might be extra careful scrutinizing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; woman traveling alone.  Thoughts?
</em><br>
<p>A more likely explanation is that women are more likely to have a carry-on
<br>
bag to search.  Women carry purses more often than men, while briefcases and
<br>
laptop computers are more evenly distributed among the sexes.
