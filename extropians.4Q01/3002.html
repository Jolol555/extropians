<em>&gt; &gt; When you /are/ right (for other reasons), it's nice to have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might to protect yourself from those who are wrong.  And even, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in this case, when you're only slightly less wrong than the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guy.  Sure, we've done some wrong things, but nothing even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remotely close to unthinkable horrors of Pearl Harbor or WTC.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See what we did in Nicaragua and Chile.  See the hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands dying and dead in Iraq from our actions during and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense Desert Storm.  See spreading cluster bombs all over parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Southeast Asia we were officially not at war with and claimed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we were not involved in.  See the bloody thugs we supported for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades in Haiti who killed more hundreds of thousands.  See
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombin whoever we feel like whenever we feel threatened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of international niceties.  In terms of lives lost,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreams destroyed, unilateral nastiness I don't think we come out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so obviously good in comparison as we would like to believe.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish I thought otherwise but I honestly do not.
</em><br>
<p>That's a fair position; active support (with money or political
<br>
influence) is something of a moral sanction, so to the extent we
<br>
have supported regimes that have done evil, some of that blood is
<br>
on the hands of the US government.  You won't get any argument
<br>
from me about that.  Evils are hard to compare.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Evil exists.  Some people, nations, and cultures are evil and wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and dangerous.  Denial of this simple fact won't make it go away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A couple of well-placed nukes 50 years ago did make some of it go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; away for a long time, and Mike is just pointing that out.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular method won't work in Afghanistan or against Al-Qaeda, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; let's hope we can find a method that does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see.  And when branded &quot;evil&quot;, rightly or wrongly, by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently powerful group, everything goes and everything is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified heh?  What a wonderful world.
</em><br>
<p>No, &quot;dangerous&quot; is required before action is justified.  It's not
<br>
enough that someone belives evil things, he must actually threaten
<br>
the lives or liberty of innocent people.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A short glance back in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history will show many groups and nations being branded as evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and decimated by strong opponents.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  And many times, that branding was wrong.  And sometimes it
<br>
wasn't.  When it wasn't wrong, the action was justified.  When it
<br>
was wrong, the action itself was evil.  That's why the most
<br>
important factor in morality is epistemology: how do we know what
<br>
the consequences of our actions will be, and how to we know that
<br>
others are a real threat rather than an imagined one?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just perhaps, branding someone or some nation as utterly evil,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not the sanest and best way to proceed.
</em><br>
<p>Evil exists.  Therefore calling someone evil /when they are,
<br>
in fact, evil/, is the only sane and rational thing to do.  Calling
<br>
them evil when they are not is indeed irrational.  That's why
<br>
rational thought is important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  When the &quot;other&quot; is &quot;evil&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the temptation is to believe that one's own group must be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;good&quot; and that any who point out where that just isn't so are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves &quot;evil&quot;.   Both sides are dehumanized by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process.  Truth is the first casualty of war.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, that too is a bad thing.  A's being evil does not in any
<br>
way imply that B is good, even if B calls A evil, and B disagrees
<br>
with everything A says.  Anyone who believes this is irrational,
<br>
and such bad arguments need to be pointed out.
<br>
<p>Epistemology matters.
