<em>&gt; For example, the Dixie Chicks sold 9 million copies of their Fly album in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the two years after it was released [1].  It probably sold for about $15.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they had reduced the cost to 1/10 as much or $1.50, would they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sold 10 times as many copies?  90 million copies?  That's almost as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as there are households in America (116 million [2]).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think the market is that big for the Dixie Chicks' music.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even at $1.50 a copy, they would not sell an album to every household
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the country.  They would make less money at 1/10 the price per unit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Dixie Chicks do better to sell their album for a larger amount and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sell to fewer people.  The exact point of optimality will depend on how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly the market falls off as the price rises.
</em><br>
<p>Look at it from the other direction: the market was willing to cough
<br>
up $100 million dollars to listen to a Dixie Chicks album, in a world
<br>
where those people could download the songs themselves for near-zero.
<br>
That means the mere convenience of getting it on a small disk that
<br>
they can take to the car, the &quot;coolness&quot; of having an authorized copy
<br>
with artwork and liner notes, etc., and perhaps the value of assuaging
<br>
their conscience that they are obeying present law, was worth $100M.
<br>
That's completely on top of what they get for live concerts, appearances
<br>
on television, endorsement deals, and other income not dependent on
<br>
IP.  Anyone who argues that the age of downloading (which takes away
<br>
only the value of that conscience-stroking) will cause artists to
<br>
starve isn't doing the math.
