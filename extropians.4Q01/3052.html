<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most New Zealanders do not mind US interventions _as long as_ they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see that America is not acting in its own interests and that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acting altruistically towards other people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is, does *anyone* beleve america acts altruistically?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if it does, it's considered dubious by most people. The Gulf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War is a classic example.
</em><br>
<p><p>Though I think that it is the freedom of anyone to behave
<br>
altruistically, and to show compassion, I don't think this should be
<br>
forced on anyone, nor even preached by anyone.
<br>
<p>It has been shown many times that, while altruism in itself was fine,
<br>
asking for it and preaching it actually pursues manipulative goals
<br>
that no one should tolerate.
<br>
<p>Read Ayn Rand's &quot;The Virtue of Selfishness&quot;. Read Friedrich Hayek's
<br>
&quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;. Read Nietzsche (who himself obviously
<br>
had a strong tendency to compassion, but who always rejected any
<br>
preaching of compassion for these same reasons).
<br>
<p>If this is true for individuals, I think it is a fortiori true for
<br>
states, as getting your state to act altruistically means forcing the
<br>
other individuals composing the state to be altruistic (if the notion
<br>
of forced altruism has any meaning). A state should care about his
<br>
interests, leave other states free to pursues their goals, and enter
<br>
in voluntary, mutually beneficial relationships with other states.
<br>
<p>As it forces all the individuals who compose it to participate in
<br>
(finance) its actions, it should not go beyond that. Let individuals
<br>
be generous if they care to be, and form private generous
<br>
organisations if they can get other individuals to voluntarily
<br>
participate in their cause.
<br>
<p>I have no idea why so many Europeans and apparently Australians think
<br>
that Americans should be altruistic. I guess it is sheer distraction.
<br>
They may be generous at times. But how can you DEMAND or even expect
<br>
it, this is beyond me.
<br>
