<p>Thank you J.R.  I am particularly careful with giving offense,
<br>
due to an unfortunate incident that dates back to my days as
<br>
a theology student.  You see, those believers who are ignorant
<br>
of the bible (the vaaaast majority) tend to have the notion that
<br>
the scriptures are free of contradictions and quirks.  Theology
<br>
students, who study the document every day, know that it is
<br>
fillllled with bugs.
<br>
<p>I was on a first date just such a young lady.  She was a fine young
<br>
lass, kind and good, and filled to overflowing with the afore-
<br>
mentioned biblical ignorance and subsequent sense of its
<br>
sacredness.  We went to a religious service with my roommate
<br>
and his fiancee.  Afterwards the four of us were sitting around
<br>
in the lobby of the women's dormitory talking.  When two or
<br>
more theology students get together, eventually someone will
<br>
say something that leads to the comment &quot;You know, they had
<br>
{x} in the bible&quot;  Second student &quot;Oh?  How so?&quot;  A number of
<br>
corny jokes will ensue, such as:
<br>
<p>Did you know they had cars in the bible?
<br>
<p>Oh?  How so?
<br>
<p>The book of Acts says &quot;The disciples were together in one
<br>
accord.&quot;
<br>
<p>Harrraarrarrarar.  Did you know they had motorcycles
<br>
in the bible?
<br>
<p>Oh?  How so?
<br>
<p>The book of Kings says &quot;David's triumph was heard throughout
<br>
the land.&quot;
<br>
<p>Harrraarrarrarar.  Did you know they had tennis in the bible?
<br>
<p>Oh?  How so?
<br>
<p>The book of Exodus says &quot;Moses played in pharoah's courts.&quot;
<br>
<p>Harrraarrarrarar.  Did you know they had cigarettes in
<br>
the bible?
<br>
<p>Oh?  How so?
<br>
<p>The book of Genesis says &quot;Rachel lighted on a camel.&quot;
<br>
<p>Harrraarrarrarar.  My roommate, who was sitting across from
<br>
me and my date noticed she was getting squirmy at the impieties.
<br>
He subtly tried to get me to cut the crap, but I failed to grok.  He
<br>
said &quot;You know, for a body of literature the length of the bible, it
<br>
is remarkable that it is totally free of overt humor.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Contraire,&quot; I replied, not recognizing the discomfort of my date.
<br>
&quot;One of the funniest comments I have read is in Judges 1:19.&quot;  I
<br>
opened my bible and quoted, verbatim:
<br>
<p>&quot;The Lord was with Judah; and He drave out the inabitants of
<br>
the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the
<br>
valley, because they had chariots of iron.&quot;
<br>
<p>My girl looked me and said coldly, &quot;I fail to see the humor.&quot;
<br>
<p>I replied, &quot;Look at what he is saying.  We had God on
<br>
our side, but they had IRON CHARIOTS!  A bunch of
<br>
tough thugs in iron  chariots got together and kicked
<br>
GODs butt!&quot;
<br>
<p>She stood up and tried to rebuke me for my blasphemies,
<br>
but got a little tongue tied.  She exclaimed &quot;You speak
<br>
great BLAMMISPHIES!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Blammisphies?&quot;  I laughed.  She turned on her heel and
<br>
stalked off.
<br>
<p>I tried to inject a bit of humor into the tense silence:  &quot;Oh dear.
<br>
As a result of my great blammisphy, I fear that I shall not be
<br>
experiencing sexual relations this evening.&quot;
<br>
<p>My roommate busted out laughing at this comment, which
<br>
caused his girl to get up and stalk off.  Neither of us got
<br>
laid that night.  My date never spoke to me again.
