This article from the Sunday _New York Times_ makes a decent case that
<br>
things may finally be starting to look up for Russia and its economy:

<br>
<p>Registration on nytimes.com is free; I'll post the first couple paragraphs
<br>
below.  I'd like to believe that Russia is at the stage now where Poland
<br>
was in 1993 or 94, but I'm skeptical:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Mr. Hirst [President of Citibank Russia] spent most of the 1990's in
<br>
Poland, where leaders imposed wrenching economic and political reforms
<br>
early in the decade to set the stage for growth. He said Russia today
<br>
was roughly where Poland was in 1993 or 1994, a year or two before social
<br>
and fiscal gains began barreling in. Russia could be on the cusp of its
<br>
own Polish-style renaissance, Mr. Hirst said.
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Would that it were so.  The idea of Russian being close to a &quot;Polish-style
<br>
renaissance&quot; strikes me as being a bit fanciful.  People threw around
<br>
this type of optimism after the USSR collapsed, and Russians got a decade
<br>
of stagnation, economic contraction and, with Yeltsin's devaluation in
<br>
1998, financial meltdown.  Comments?
<br>
<p>Here are the first few paragraphs of the article:

At Last, Signs of Economic Revival in Russia
<br>
<p>By MICHAEL WINES
<br>
<p>MOSCOW, Nov. 17 — At last, Russia may be turning the corner. 
<br>
<p>Ask Yevgeny G. Peskin, vice president of IBS Group, an information technology
<br>
company based in Moscow. He says Russian demand for computer hardware
<br>
is growing at a 17 percent-a-year clip. Even better, demand for computer
<br>
services is up nearly 30 percent. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Things have been happening with mind-boggling speed since 1990,&quot; he
<br>
said. &quot;But in the last two years there was a massive change in the way
<br>
business is done in Russia.&quot;
<br>
<p>Or ask Yuri Levada. His National Public Opinion Research Center measures
<br>
general optimism among Russian families, an index that has increased
<br>
more than 35 percent this year, to its highest point ever. 
<br>
<p>&quot;All the ratings of consumer behavior and social behavior are better,&quot;
<br>
he said. &quot;The average person's situation is much better than two years
<br>
— or even several months — ago.&quot;
<br>
