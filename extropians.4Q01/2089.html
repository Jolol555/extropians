<br>
<p>Life span extension and prevention of neurological deterioration in mice
<br>
demonstrated with synthetic catalytic anti-oxidants
<br>
<p>Studies support potential new approach to treating Parkinson's, Alzheimer's
<br>
and
<br>
other neurodegenerative diseases
<br>
<p>Novato, CA and Bedford, MA, November 1, 2001 - Neurodegenerative diseases such
<br>
as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease may be attenuated through the use of
<br>
certain drugs, known as synthetic catalytic scavengers of reactive oxygen
<br>
species (SCSs), that powerfully augment natural anti-oxidant systems,
<br>
scientists reported in the November 2001 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience.
<br>
The report details experiments in which treatment with SCSs rescued a severe
<br>
neurological phenotype in mice engineered to undergo a specific form of
<br>
oxidative damage. Treatment with the SCSs also resulted in a dramatic
<br>
enhancement of lifespan of the mice.
<br>
<p>The research contained in the report was conducted through a collaboration
<br>
among scientists at the Buck Institute for Age Research (Novato, CA),
<br>
Eukarion,
<br>
Inc. (Bedford, MA) and others.
<br>
<p>The studies utilized mice that lack a form of superoxide dismutase (SOD2), a
<br>
natural anti-oxidant enzyme found in the mitochondria. The mitochondria
<br>
essentially serve as the powerplant of the cell, utilizing oxygen and
<br>
nutrients
<br>
to generate the energy that is critical to cellular functions. As a byproduct
<br>
to this key process, known as oxidative metabolism, the mitochondria also
<br>
produce potentially damaging reactive oxygen species and, hence, the
<br>
mitochondria's own antioxidant defenses are extremely important. Oxidative
<br>
damage to the mitochondria has been implicated in several neurodegenerative
<br>
diseases and disorders, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases,
<br>
amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Freidrich's ataxia, and aging.
<br>
<p>Previous studies showed that mice lacking SOD2 undergo oxidative damage to the
<br>
mitochondria and, concomitantly, suffer a variety of severe pathologies in
<br>
many
<br>
tissues. Untreated, these mice live for approximately one week. Treated with
<br>
an
<br>
antioxidant that does not gain access to the brain, the mice live longer, but
<br>
develop a lethal neurological disorder. This disorder, a spongiform
<br>
encephalopathy, involves widespread pathological damage to the brain and
<br>
profound motor disturbances.
<br>
<p>In the Journal of Neuroscience study, mice lacking SOD2 were treated with
<br>
three
<br>
different SCSs. The SCSs are proprietary compounds developed by Eukarion that
<br>
mimic the naturally occurring cellular antioxidant enzymes SOD and catalase.
<br>
These antioxidant enzymes normally work together to protect cells and tissues
<br>
from damage due to oxidative stress. The study showed that treatment with each
<br>
of the SCSs dramatically enhanced survival of the mice, increasing their
<br>
lifespan to greater than three-fold that of untreated mice. In addition, SCS
<br>
treatment rescued the spongiform neurodegenerative disorder, demonstrating
<br>
that
<br>
the SCSs crossed the blood-brain barrier and gained access to the
<br>
mitochondria,
<br>
the main site of oxidative stress.
<br>
<p>&quot;These studies are important and relevant to human diseases,&quot; said Simon
<br>
Melov,
<br>
Ph.D., a founding faculty member of the Buck Institute. &quot;They clearly
<br>
demonstrate, in a mammalian system, the link between a build-up of
<br>
mitochondrial oxidative stress and the development of severe neurodegeneration
<br>
with potential relevance to several age-related degenerative diseases.
<br>
Further,
<br>
they build on previous studies we published which showed a significant
<br>
extension of life span in the nematode worm C. elegans through treatment with
<br>
SCSs, now extending key elements of those earlier findings to mammals.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;These new results also build upon our earlier research in models for
<br>
neurological disorders such as stroke and ALS, demonstrating clearly that SCSs
<br>
cross the blood-brain barrier and protect the brain mitochondria from
<br>
oxidative
<br>
damage,&quot; said Susan R. Doctrow, Ph.D., Eukarion's Vice President, Research,
<br>
&quot;In
<br>
particular, the most effective compound in the study, EUK-189, was designed
<br>
for
<br>
enhanced cellular and brain permeability. We are working to advance SCSs such
<br>
as EUK-189 toward clinical development for treatment of a potentially broad
<br>
range of degenerative, age-related conditions.&quot;

<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
