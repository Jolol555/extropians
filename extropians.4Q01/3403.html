<p><p>A Practical Way to Make Power From Wasted Heat
<br>
<p>By KENNETH CHANG
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
cientists at M.I.T. and a small company in Salt Lake City are scheduled to 
<br>
announce today that they have developed technology that can efficiently and 
<br>
inexpensively transform heat pollution into electricity.
<br>
<p>Although only a few crude samples have been built, Dr. Yan Kucherov, director 
<br>
of research and development at the Salt Lake City company, Eneco Inc., and 
<br>
Dr. Peter L. Hagelstein, professor of electrical engineering at M.I.T. and a 
<br>
technical consultant at Eneco, say that their devices improve the efficiency 
<br>
of the conversion by more than half.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's really first-generation, very primitive implementation,&quot; Dr. Hagelstein 
<br>
said. &quot;Potentially, it's an enormous deal. This opens a door.&quot;
<br>
<p>While the heat generated by car engines and power plants usually does nothing 
<br>
but warm the surrounding air, scientists have long dreamed of building 
<br>
so-called thermoelectric devices that can capture the wasted heat and convert 
<br>
a portion of it into electricity.
<br>
<p>Such devices could significantly increase the electrical output of existing 
<br>
power plants or power the electrical systems of automobiles, replacing 
<br>
alternators and increasing gas mileage.
<br>
<p>The Pentagon, which partly financed the new research, has been interested in 
<br>
using the devices for silent motors. Operating in reverse, thermoelectric 
<br>
devices can also be used as refrigerators.
<br>
<p>Another advantage of thermoelectric devices is that they produce electricity 
<br>
without generating additional pollution.
<br>
<p>Current thermoelectric technology converts only about 10 percent of the heat 
<br>
it absorbs into electricity, too inefficient a return for widespread use. The 
<br>
new devices, however, reach about 17 percent, and Dr. Hagelstein said future 
<br>
devices should be able to improve upon that significantly.
<br>
<p>It is impossible to transform 100 percent of the heat into electricity. The 
<br>
laws of physics dictate a theoretical maximum of about 50 percent at the 
<br>
temperature a thermoelectric device operates at. Current commercial 
<br>
thermoelectric devices, at 10 percent efficiency, get only one-fifth the 
<br>
maximum. Using the new technology, future devices should be able to achieve 
<br>
more than half the maximum.
<br>
<p>The researchers are presenting their findings at a meeting of the Materials 
<br>
Research Society in Boston. Scientific papers describing the experiments have 
<br>
been submitted to the journals Physical Review Letters and Applied Physics 
<br>
Letters.
<br>
<p>If borne out, the findings would be significant, said Dr. George S. Nolas, a 
<br>
professor of physics at the University of South Florida and an organizer of a 
<br>
symposium about thermoelectric devices at the Materials Research Society 
<br>
meeting. Dr. Nolas had not seen the Eneco paper but said the reported 
<br>
efficiency was high enough to find practical use and &quot;would be pretty good 
<br>
news.&quot;
<br>
<p>Eneco's thermoelectric device is a sandwich of three layers of semiconductor. 
<br>
One outer layer is heated; the other is kept at room temperature. The middle 
<br>
layer acts as an insulator to maintain the temperature difference.
<br>
<p>The heat causes electrons to shoot out, some crossing the sandwich to 
<br>
generate an electrical current. The Eneco researchers added impurities — a 
<br>
process called doping — to the heated layer to increase the flow of 
<br>
electrons.
<br>
<p>&quot;The region near the hot part is heavily doped, so it boils off electrons,&quot; 
<br>
Dr. Hagelstein said. &quot;We get more voltage and more current.&quot;
<br>
<p>He added: &quot;The underlying technology is really very simple. It should be a 
<br>
very practical, relatively cheap technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>Leroy Becker, marketing director of Eneco, which is not associated with the 
<br>
Dutch utility Eneco Energie, said the company hoped to produce a prototype of 
<br>
a practical device within a year and sell it within two years.
<br>
<p>Eneco, a privately held company, was created in 1991 to seek to license 
<br>
patents on cold fusion after the controversial claim of two University of 
<br>
Utah scientists that they could produce almost limitless amounts of energy in 
<br>
a room-temperature flask of water. Eneco also financed follow-up research on 
<br>
cold fusion, including work by Dr. Hagelstein. The claims for cold fusion 
<br>
were far overstated, and several years ago, Eneco shifted its focus to 
<br>
thermoelectric devices.
