<p>
Other than putting it in the &quot;mysterious bags of white powder&quot;
<br>
found at the WTC a day after the attack and since forgotten, 
<br>
the ones that everyone laughed and claimed were probably just 
<br>
cocaine?
<br>
<p>Other than that... 
<br>
<p>I'd put it into the ventilation fan of a major building that uses
<br>
recycled air and thus wouldn't vent my precious Anthrax outside
<br>
where it might disspate (however, if I thought crop-dusting with
<br>
it was going to work well, I might not worry about that part...
<br>
unless the crop dusting business was a deliberate red herring).
<br>
<p>Rather lame approach of mailing it to the media, eh?  Can you 
<br>
think of a better way to facilitate panic than to attack the
<br>
propagandists directly and let them spread their own fear? 
<br>
Lame, my ass.  If I were trying to drum-up a major war, I'd
<br>
certainly spend the &quot;intensive&quot; labor of mailing germ warfare
<br>
agents to the propaganda machine of a powerful and determined
<br>
enemy.  Read the Al Qaida propaganda, they WANT a major war,
<br>
they WANT to spread enough fear to provoke the US to do 
<br>
something that will put all one billion muslims on their side.
<br>
That is essentially their stated goal - to draw ALL muslims
<br>
into a Holy War against the corrupt and decadent West and
<br>
the opressive, traitorous Mid East regiemes that the West
<br>
supports.
<br>
<p>Attacking the media with Anthrax wouldn't be a tactic to get
<br>
body-count, it would be a tactic to spread fear.  Now, of
<br>
course, there is no proof that it was Al Qaida that did it as
<br>
part of a deliberate fear tactic, but if it wasn't it is a
<br>
HELL of a coincidence (especially since the first cases 
<br>
were contracted at a time that roughly coincides with the 
<br>
attack...) 
<br>
<p>It's a meme war, and if you believe Tony Blair, we're losing.
<br>
The raisin bombers, so far according to Blair, aren't
<br>
sufficient.  We need a better weapon in the war for the hearts 
<br>
and minds... 
<br>
<p>LL+P,
<br>
Stephan

<p>If you were a terrorist, and you had several kilos of stolen Russian
<br>
anthrax those mean FBI guys wouldn't let you load onto a crop duster,
<br>
what would you do with it? Besides the rather lame and labor-intensive
<br>
approach of mailing it to various newspapers and television stations?
<br>
Think carefully, the ass you save by predicting their next move may be
<br>
your own.

<br>
