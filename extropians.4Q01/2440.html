<p>LIFE EXTENSION WEEKLY UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
New mechanism found for NSAIDs against Alzheimer's disease
<br>
<p>In a study partly funded by the National Institutes of Health published in
<br>
the November 8 2001 issue of the journal Nature <a href="http://www.nature.com">http://www.nature.com</a> ,
<br>
researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine and
<br>
the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida discovered that the nonsteroidal
<br>
anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen,  indomethacin and sulindac sulphide
<br>
inhibit the formation of the most harmful plaque-producing protein that
<br>
occurs in Alzheimer's disease, independently of their anti-inflammatory
<br>
effect.  Although it is known that the use of  nonsteroidal antinflammatory
<br>
drugs, or NSAIDS, is associated with a lower incidence of Alzheimer's
<br>
disease, control of inflammatory processes in the brain through
<br>
cyclooxygenase inhibition appeared to be their most obvious mechanism of
<br>
action.
<br>
<p>Alzheimer's disease involves the abnormal production and deposit of
<br>
amyloid-beta peptides which form plaques in the brains of its sufferers.
<br>
The harmful protein inhibited by the drugs is the 42-residue isoform of the
<br>
amyloid-beta peptide, or AB42, which is the type of amyloid-beta initially
<br>
deposited in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, and believed to be the main
<br>
culprit in the disease.
<br>
<p>The researchers treated cell cultures with increasing concentrations of the
<br>
different NSAIDs and analyzed levels of AB40 and AB42.  The AB42 peptide was
<br>
found to have been lowered up to 80% by ibuprofen, indomethacin and
<br>
sulindac.  Other NSAIDs:  aspirin,  Naproxen and celecoxib, failed to lower
<br>
AB42.   When the researchers gave ibuprofen to mice bred to produce amyloid
<br>
precursor protein, they had lower brain levels of AB42.   The researchers
<br>
then treated cells genetically engineered to lack the cyclooxygenase, or
<br>
COX, enzymes with sulindac and found that AB42 levels were lowered as well.
<br>
This proved that an anti-inflammatory response, dependent on COX inhibition,
<br>
was not involved in the drug's action.  It is the anti-inflammatory action
<br>
of NSAIDs that is the cause of their adverse gastrointestinal and
<br>
kidney-related effects.  Currently, the drugs are not recommended for
<br>
Alzheimer's disease because the high doses needed could lead to these
<br>
unwanted effects.  Senior author Edward Koo, of UC San Diego's Department of
<br>
Neurosciences explained, &quot;The dose required to inhibit production of AB42 is
<br>
far too high. This is a secondary effect of the NSAIDs. For example, a
<br>
patient would need to take the equivalent of more than 16 tablets of Advil a
<br>
day.  Our findings suggest a new mechanism through which NSAIDs might confer
<br>
protection from Alzheimer's disease - a mechanism independent of direct
<br>
anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDs.&quot;
<br>
<p>This new discovery will aid in the development of anti-Alzheimer's therapies
<br>
with fewer side effects.
<br>
<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Alzheimer's disease
<br>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. However, it is a
<br>
diagnosis of exclusion. The diagnosis is only 85% to 90% accurate and the
<br>
diagnosis is only absolutely confirmed by brain biopsy after death. Brain
<br>
biopsy is usually unacceptable prior to death, and other causes of dementia
<br>
must be considered and eliminated before the diagnosis of Alzheimer's is
<br>
made.
<br>
<p>Alzheimer's-like symptoms can be manifested by a variety of different
<br>
diseases including:
<br>
<p>Space-occupying lesions in the brain, such as brain cancer and subdural
<br>
hematoma.
<br>
<p>Neurological damage, such as occurs after a stroke or with multiple
<br>
infarctions.
<br>
<p>Other neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (a deficiency of
<br>
dopamine), Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis.
<br>
<p>Infectious diseases such as meningitis, late-stage syphilis, and AIDS.
<br>
<p>Endocrine disorders, such as hypothyroidism and hypoglycemia.
<br>
<p>Cardiovascular disorders, such as congestive heart failure and vascular
<br>
disease.
<br>
<p>Liver or kidney dysfunction.
<br>
<p>Nutritional deficiencies of vitamin E, magnesium, and B vitamins (B12, folic
<br>
acid, niacin and thiamin) can also produce symptoms which might be mistaken
<br>
for dementia.
<br>
<p><p>Standard lab tests for Alzheimer's disease include:
<br>
<p>CBC
<br>
<p>Thyroid panel: T3, T4, TSH
<br>
<p>Liver function tests
<br>
<p>STD testing: VRDL for syphilis, HIV if young
<br>
<p>EKG to assess heart function
<br>
<p>EEG to differentiate focal vs. diffuse brain dysfunction
<br>
Vitamin B12 and folate levels
<br>
<p>A CT or MRI of the head is usually ordered to determine if the symptoms are
<br>
caused by multi-infarct dementia or a subdural hematoma.
<br>
<p>Several alternative lab tests may be helpful in evaluating patients with
<br>
Alzheimer's disease to guide treatments. These include:
<br>
<p>A comprehensive hormone panel, including estrogen (E1, E2 and E3),
<br>
progesterone, testosterone, and melatonin
<br>
<p>Adrenal function test, including cortisol and DHEA
<br>
Oxidative stress levels
<br>
<p>Essential Fatty Acid Panel
<br>
<p>Homocysteine, B6, B12, and folate levels
<br>
<p>Markers of inflammation, including C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
<br>
<p>Hair mineral analysis to assess heavy metal toxicity
<br>
<p>A comprehensive vitamin panel (including vitamins A, C, E, and K and
<br>
beta-carotene) should be considered.

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
<br>
<p>Phosphatidylserine
<br>
<p>In 1988, the Foundation published an article about studies in Europe showing
<br>
phosphatidylserine could slow and reverse the rate of brain cell aging in
<br>
laboratory animals. Phosphatidylserine restored mental function in older
<br>
animals to levels exceeding those found in some younger animals. Although
<br>
studies in humans with Alzheimer's disease were less dramatic, they still
<br>
produced significant improvements in cognitive function. In patients with
<br>
mild dementia, significant cognitive and behavioral enhancing effects were
<br>
observed. In one study with mildly demented elderly patients, the
<br>
improvement in neural function continued 30 days after discontinuing
<br>
phosphatidylserine (PS) therapy. This suggests that relatively low doses or
<br>
cyclical dosing of PS therapy over an extended period of time in healthy
<br>
people may produce sustained antiaging results.
<br>
<p>Brain tissues are especially rich in PS, but aging causes a decline in the
<br>
PS content of cells throughout the body. Research has shown that in addition
<br>
to improving neural function, PS enhances energy metabolism in all cells. In
<br>
the brain, PS helps maintain cell membrane integrity and youthful synaptic
<br>
plasticity, protecting brain cells against the functional deterioration that
<br>
occurs as a result of aging.

<p>Vinpocetine
<br>
<p>Vinpocetine is derived from vincamine, the major indole alkaloid of the
<br>
periwinkle plant. Vinpocetine has been used for many years in Europe to
<br>
enhance memory and mental function by increasing neuronal firing rate. No
<br>
toxic effects have been seen from vinpocetine use at levels far above
<br>
therapeutic dosages.
<br>
<p>When taken orally, vinpocetine can:
<br>
<p>Improve blood supply to the brain
<br>
<p>Increase oxygen and glucose use by the brain
<br>
<p>Improve brain tolerance to hypoxic excitoxicity
<br>
<p>Increase vasodilation response to hypoxia
<br>
<p>Increase ATP levels in the brain
<br>
<p>Reduce abnormal coagulation of blood
<br>
<p>Raise brain levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin

<br>
How Coenzyme Q10 protects the brain
<br>
Conclusion of a 3-Part Series on Cellular Bioenergetics and CoQ10
<br>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common adult-onset dementia. In recent years
<br>
researchers have discovered many of the mechanisms involved in the disease,
<br>
but we cannot yet clearly separate causes from effects in this complex
<br>
pathology. The theories we discuss are necessarily quite speculative.
<br>
<p>The main effects of Alzheimer's disease on brain tissue are extensive neuron
<br>
loss and insoluble fibrous deposits called senile plaques and
<br>
neurofibrillary tangles. The core of the plaques is a toxic protein,
<br>
amyloid-beta, that assails cells on several fronts. Amyloid-beta generates
<br>
oxidative stress, damages mitochondrial DNA, impairs cellular bioenergetics,
<br>
and alters proteins so as to form neurofibrillary tangles.
<br>
<p>A number of recent studies have found that the degree of disability in
<br>
Alzheimer's disease patients correlates with impairment of energy metabolism
<br>
in the brain. In fact, a new study suggests that cellular energy production
<br>
may be a better indicator than senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease
<br>
severity. This study of Alzheimer's patients in a nursing home found that
<br>
their degree of clinical disability correlated with a mitochondrial
<br>
abnormality involved in cellular respiration, but did not correlate with the
<br>
density of senile plaques.
<br>
<p>Together with amyloid-beta, a potent free radical called peroxynitrite
<br>
oxidizes lipids in neuronal membranes. This generates the highly toxic
<br>
byproduct HNE that is found in excess in multiple regions of the Alzheimer's
<br>
disease brain. HNE kills brain cells directly, and also indirectly by making
<br>
them more vulnerable to excitotoxicity. As we have seen, the coantioxidants
<br>
coQ10 and vitamin E protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation, and
<br>
coQ10 has been found to reduce peroxynitrite damage and HNE formation in the
<br>
bloodstream.
<br>
<p>We do not know whether Alzheimer's disease arises from a single underlying
<br>
cause. An interesting multiple-factor theory was published in the journal
<br>
Gerontology (Ying W, 1997). According to this theory, Alzheimer's disease
<br>
develops from four causes: imbalances in APP (amyloid precursor protein) and
<br>
calcium, oxidative damage and bioenergetic deficit. The author cites studies
<br>
showing that each of the factors reinforces and is reinforced by each of the
<br>
other factors. This &quot;deleterious network,&quot; as the author calls it,
<br>
potentially fits the therapeutic profile of coQ10. However, CoQ10 has never
<br>
been included in a clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease. The reasons for
<br>
this may not be scientific ones, as discussed at the end of this article.
