<p><em>&gt;My thoughts on Identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am relatively new to this particular list so I had not seen this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion come up before.  I have thought some about this  and think it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a very important issue to resolve.
</em><br>
<p>This discussion has come up before, and some do not think it belongs
<br>
to this forum. I agree that it is an important issue (even if we
<br>
cannot perhaps &quot;resolve&quot; it yet). It is indeed crucial to the proposed
<br>
preservation of consciousness and identity through uploading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... the sentient being that awoke would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all my thoughts and experiences and would have a continuity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness.  However, this sentient being is, by definition, a copy.  Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an exact copy me?  I dont think so, I think its  just an exact copy *of* me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This means that the original me does not ever perceive a waking up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensation.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that if the copy has all your thoughts and experiences, and
<br>
a continuity of consciousness, then he (not it) feels like &quot; the
<br>
original you&quot; has perceived a waking up sensation. I would say that
<br>
this statement is identical to &quot;the original me perceives a waking up
<br>
sensation&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In reality, unless the copy of me is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identical at the quantum level, theoretically a test could be made to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that this is not indeed the original me and is a copy.
</em><br>
<p>IMO this depends on how you define &quot;the original me&quot;. Of course the
<br>
statement above is true if you include your physical properties in the
<br>
definition. But it is also true if I wake up in the hospital after an
<br>
amputation. Here the common sense view is that I am still me after the
<br>
amputation. I believe this common sense view still holds if part or
<br>
all of the physical brain is removed, provided the &quot;identity&quot; encoded
<br>
in the brain is preserved. And after a lot of thinking and reading on
<br>
this issue, I am more and more convinced that the simplest working
<br>
definition of &quot;identity&quot; is consciousness and memory. In other words a
<br>
conscious being with all my memories is me. Or at least it contains me
<br>
(thinking of more complex cases where more than one set of memories
<br>
are uploaded to the same conscious processor).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is no doubt in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my mind that this copy is a sentient being,  but there is a doubt in my mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it is *me*  Sure, my thoughts hopes dreams and fears and any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contribution I may bring to the world may live on in this copy, but I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wake up and live on.
</em><br>
<p>I think that if the copy feels continuity between the original you and
<br>
himself, then you wake up and live on. Unfortunately there appears to
<br>
be no way to establish an operative difference between this position
<br>
and yours. Perhaps we have to wait until the copy/restore process is
<br>
technically feasible, and then just ask the question to a copy. But to
<br>
continue the argument, how can you be sure that you don't die every
<br>
night when you go to sleep and that the conscious being who awakes the
<br>
next morning is not a copy with the same memories?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In conclusion, I do not find any solace in a copy of me living on, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is objectively identical to me, subjectively it is  not.  So, I think,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until the above scenario is achieved, I would opt for dearly protecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physiological mechanism currently  housing my consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Well of course I also wish to continue living in my body, at least as
<br>
long as it provides me with a reasonable quality of life. But when
<br>
this option is not on the table anymore, and of course copy/upload
<br>
technology has been developen in the meantime, I believe I would be
<br>
willing to try.
