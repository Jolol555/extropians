<p><p>This is essentially my basic operating rules, which seem very reasoned and
<br>
fair to me as well.  However, I've noticed that this basic reasoning doesn't
<br>
fly very well with a lot of potential partners, even at an abstract level.
<br>
&quot;Logical and reasonable&quot; isn't a good reason for many people &lt;sigh&gt;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; That doesn't mean that one cannot develop a monogamous relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a tip of the hat to Spike) through voluntary sign-up but there would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be opt-out clauses (for me).  The structure of most common contracts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and therefore most meme sets other humans possess), e.g. marriage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tends to be all or nothing.  I've yet to find someone with whom one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can define how this aspect of a relationship should be structured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on reason rather than emotion.
</em><br>
<p><p>The most satisfying development in my personal relationships has been the
<br>
adoption of a policy of explicitly agreeing to the basic terms (and
<br>
limitations) of the relationship at the beginning.  Any terminal
<br>
incompatibility will be readily obvious by doing so, and it helps eliminate
<br>
miscommunication due to differing basic, and frequently unstated,
<br>
assumptions.  Unfortunately, most people don't REALLY seem to want to
<br>
explicitly state the terms and conditions of a relationship.  I've only met
<br>
one or two women that seem capable of actually addressing and living up to a
<br>
relationship based on explicit terms, all of whom have been anomalously
<br>
reasoned and rational about everything in general.
<br>
<p>On my personal rant issue of marriage specifically, the contents and
<br>
administration of marriage contracts would be utterly unacceptable if
<br>
applied to business in most States.  Yet the State basically defines those
<br>
rules by fiat, giving the individual little leeway in tailoring their
<br>
specific &quot;relationship contract&quot; to meet there specific needs and desires.
<br>
In theory one could create a custom legal surrogate for State defined
<br>
marriage, but it would take a lot more effort.  I would prefer to eliminate
<br>
marriage as a special statutory contract altogether, as even if you accept
<br>
the basic premises of the statutory forms, the current incarnations are
<br>
generally sub-optimal for most people.  Eliminating the &quot;one size fits all&quot;
<br>
marriage contract would probably go a long way towards reducing the divorce
<br>
rate.  For starters, I think many people in today's western society would be
<br>
better served by time limited contracts (none of this &quot;in perpetuity&quot; crap)
<br>
that have to be renewed, renegotiated, or simply dropped on regular
<br>
intervals.  This would force the contracts to have proper exit/termination
<br>
clauses, the general lack of which is why divorce courts are so busy these
<br>
days.
