Brain may forge some memories in waves
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/20011110/fob6.asp">http://www.sciencenews.org/20011110/fob6.asp</a>
<br>
<p>Although people effortlessly remember all sorts of everyday events, scientists
<br>
are struggling to explain how the brain makes this possible. In two critical
<br>
brain areas, such memory may hinge more on the timing than on the strength of
<br>
neural activity, according to a team of neuroscientists.
<br>
<p>As volunteers study word lists, clusters of neurons in the rhinal cortex and
<br>
the hippocampus-adjacent brain areas already implicated in memory-fire
<br>
synchronized electrical bursts that pave the way for remembering those words
<br>
later, argue Jürgen Fell of the University of Bonn in Germany and his
<br>
colleagues.
<br>
<p>Moreover, the coordination of cell activity in the same two brain regions
<br>
plummets for a fraction of a second just after participants remember a word
<br>
from the list, possibly signaling an end to a coordinated neural effort,
<br>
Fell's team proposes in an article slated to appear in Nature Neuroscience.
<br>
<p>&quot;These are enticing data,&quot; says neuroscientist Anthony D. Wagner of the
<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;Memory may emerge when rhinal and
<br>
hippocampal neurons synchronously oscillate and then desynchronize.&quot;
<br>
<p>Some scientists theorize that synchronized neural firing, which generates
<br>
brain waves, lies at the root of perception and memory (SN: 2/20/99, p. 122).
<br>
Attention has focused on gamma waves, which are the result of thousands of
<br>
neurons emitting equivalent electrical pulses about 40 times a second.
<br>
<p>Fell's group studied gamma waves in nine epileptic adults in whom surgeons had
<br>
temporarily implanted electrodes to find seizure sites. None had suffered a
<br>
seizure for at least 1 day. In the investigation, the volunteers studied a
<br>
word list, performed a brief distracting task, and then tried to recall words
<br>
from the list.
<br>
<p>About one-quarter second and again one-half second after viewing words that
<br>
they would later remember, participants displayed bursts of gamma activity in
<br>
the rhinal cortex and the hippocampus. One second after they recalled a word
<br>
from the studied list, synchronized neural firing declined sharply for a
<br>
fraction of a second.
<br>
<p>No distinctive type of gamma activity occurred while participants viewed words
<br>
that they later failed to recall or when they tried to recall a word in vain.
<br>
<p>It's unclear how the waxing and waning of gamma activity in the rhinal cortex
<br>
and the hippocampus boosts memory, the researchers note. Preliminary evidence
<br>
suggests that gamma waves in the hippocampus render cells more capable of
<br>
receiving incoming messages, they say.
<br>
<p>The origins of synchronized firing in the rhinal cortex and the hippocampus
<br>
are also unknown, Wagner remarks. Another brain area, the prefrontal cortex,
<br>
may regulate memory-related gamma activity elsewhere, in his view.
<br>
<p>Another open question concerns the type of memory fostered by rhinal
<br>
cortex-hippocampus cooperation. Fell's team examined conscious recall, which
<br>
has often been attributed to the hippocampus. In contrast, many
<br>
neuroscientists suspect that the rhinal cortex supports a sense of familiarity
<br>
that falls short of conscious recall of previously encountered information.
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
