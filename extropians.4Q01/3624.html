</em><br>
<p>To answer, I would merge the cases:
<br>
<p>&lt;EDITED&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All info on you that is necessary to make an absolutely perfect copy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stored; same internal state in your finite state machine self.  This
</em><br>
process
<br>
<em>&gt; happens at point A.  Said info is shipped to point B.
</em><br>
<p>After some arbitrary time...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A duplicate of you at that point in time is created at point B.
</em><br>
<p>Also, after some arbitrary time...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The original you is now destroyed.
</em><br>
<p><p>I claim that the data at point B, being separated from point A, will not be
<br>
affected by actions at point A.  Specifically, it doesn't matter whether the
<br>
original is destroyed before the copy is created, right after the copy is
<br>
created, or lives it's entire life to be destroyed long after the copy is
<br>
created.
<br>
<p>Now, I will admit, that the above does not answer the question, but I want
<br>
you (the reader) to consider if it is a valid point.  If it IS a valid
<br>
point, then I have an answer to the question from experience.
<br>
<p>I am an identical twin.  My twin is Harvey Newstrom, who also posts to this
<br>
net.  Early in the womb, when our cells were first divided, we were exact
<br>
copies.  As time went on, we evolved into two separate beings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my experience, I can say, that I do NOT perceive my twin as &quot;another
</em><br>
me&quot;.  I also have an older brother, who looks pretty much like we do.  (Same
<br>
hair, same eyes, etc.)  If my parents had not told me that I was a twin, I
<br>
don't think I would have noticed any difference between my two brothers.
<br>
The fact that one is a &quot;copy&quot; of me, and the other isn't is not perceived in
<br>
any way.
<br>
<p>Therefore, I think that if you DO make an exact copy, you are creating a new
<br>
consciousness.  It may be indistinguishable from me, from the outside, but
<br>
from the inside, my consciousness is only connected to this body.  The
<br>
copies are not relevant to me, any more than any other human being.
<br>
