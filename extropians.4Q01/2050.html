<p>When a Picture Is Worth a Thousand Secrets: The Debate Over Online Steganography 
<br>
<p>By Andy Carvin (<a href="mailto:acarvin@benton.org?Subject=Re:%20The%20Digital%20Beat:%20The%20Debate%20Over%20Online%20Steganography&In-Reply-To=&lt;3BE2AF3B.4F30802@mindspring.com&gt;">acarvin@benton.org</a>) 
<br>
<p>Introduction 
<br>
<p>In the weeks since the horrendous September 11 attacks on New York and
<br>
Washington DC, investigators around the world have poured over tens of thousands
<br>
of leads. With each turn, it seems, authorities explore new pieces of evidence
<br>
that somehow fit into the giant puzzle that makes up the al Qaeda terrorist
<br>
network. 
<br>
<p>As the news media continues its marathon coverage of the attack and subsequent
<br>
U.S. retaliations, one accusation has received particular attention. Reports
<br>
from ABC News, the Associated Press, the New York Times and Newsweek, among
<br>
other media outlets, have alleged that terrorists associated with Osama bin
<br>
Laden may have communicated covertly by imbedding secret messages into publicly
<br>
available files on the Internet, including images from adult porn sites. 
<br>
<p>This allegation has yet to be proven -- the FBI has stated in briefings that
<br>
they don't have evidence to back up these charges. But these media reports have
<br>
re-ignited interest in this ancient cloak-and-dagger technique, adding more fuel
<br>
to the fire in the searing debate over online civil liberties in a
<br>
post-September 11 world. 
<br>
<p>Steganography: Hiding in Plain Sight 
<br>
<p>Steganography, the science of hiding secret messages within publicly accessible
<br>
material, is by no means new. One of the first accounts of steganography in
<br>
action dates back to the Greek historian Herodotus. In the fifth century BCE he
<br>
documented the story of Demeratus, who struggled to find a way of alerting
<br>
Sparta that the Persian Great King Xerxes was gearing up to invade Greece.
<br>
Knowing that any overt message would be intercepted easily by the Persians, he
<br>
scraped off the wax surface of a wooden writing tablet and scratched his warning
<br>
into the underlying wood. Demeratus then re-coated the tablet with a fresh layer
<br>
of wax, thus allowing the apparently blank writing tablet to be carried off to
<br>
Sparta without arousing suspicion. 
<br>
<p>The term steganography dates back to 14th century. German mathematician Johannes
<br>
Trithemius penned a book on black magic entitled Steganographia -- Greek for
<br>
&quot;hidden writing.&quot; Indeed, the controversial book was about hidden writing.
<br>
Instead of being a treatise on black magic, the manuscript was actually a
<br>
well-disguised essay on cryptography -- so well disguised that it took half a
<br>
millennia to crack it completely. 
<br>
<p>During the 19th century, spies used creative forms of steganography throughout
<br>
the course of the legendary Great Game -- the decades-long war of stealth
<br>
conducted between imperial Russia and Great Britain as they competed for
<br>
dominance in Central Asia. The famed British-Indian spies known as pundits used
<br>
the accoutrements of itinerant monks to disguise the fact that they were mapping
<br>
out the complex topographies of Tibet and Afghanistan. Pundits would carry a
<br>
modified rosary made up of 100 prayer beads (instead of the 108 beads usually
<br>
found in a Buddhist rosary), allowing them to secretly tabulate the number of
<br>
paces as they walked in any given direction. The details of their covert
<br>
surveying work would then be hidden amongst handwritten prayers contained in the
<br>
center of the Tibetan prayer wheels they carried openly. 
<br>
<p>In modern times, steganography was used successfully during wartime as a way of
<br>
transmitting messages in plain view. German and allied forces both employed
<br>
steganography during the First World War; in one particular case, a German spy
<br>
transmitted the following message: 
<br>
<p>Apparently neutral's protest is thoroughly discounted and ignored.  Isman hard
<br>
hit.  Blockade issue affects pretext for embargo on byproducts, ejecting suets
<br>
and vegetable oils. 
<br>
<p>A casual observer might easily ignore this seemingly innocuous message, but if
<br>
you take the second letter in each word, you'll soon discover a secret message: 
<br>
<p>Pershing sails from NY June 1. 
<br>
<p>A well-publicized example of steganography occurred during the height of the
<br>
Vietnam War, when Commander Jeremiah Denton, a naval aviator who had been shot
<br>
down and captured by North Vietnamese forces, was paraded in front of the news
<br>
media as part of well-staged propaganda event. Denton knew he would be unable to
<br>
say anything critical of his captors outright, so as he spoke to the media, he
<br>
blinked his eyes in Morse code, spelling out T-O-R-T-U-R-E. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most public post-September 11 accusation regarding steganography
<br>
occurred several weeks ago when the Arab-language news service Al Jazeera
<br>
broadcast videotaped statements by Osama bin Laden and his associates in their
<br>
entirety. The Bush administration quickly responded by requesting that all media
<br>
outlets use greater discretion when it came to airing statements from Al Qaeda,
<br>
fearing that the unedited statements might contain secret messages -- messages
<br>
communicated by means of certain words or phrases being used, combinations of
<br>
clothing or discrete nonverbal gestures. 
<br>
<p>Old Tricks, New Techniques 
<br>
<p>Steganography, as the above examples demonstrate, is not limited to one
<br>
particular medium or technology -- it's simply a matter of disguising a covert
<br>
message within an overt one, whether that overt message is an ancient wax
<br>
tablet, a telegram or a person speaking through a television broadcast. So it
<br>
should come as no surprise that the technique has also found its way onto the
<br>
Internet. In fact, steganography tools are freely available for public use.
<br>
Steganography software allows users to secretly incorporate data into various
<br>
digital media - text, jpeg images, MP3 audio files, etc. 
<br>
<p>One relatively innocuous example of online steganography in action can be found
<br>
at the Web site SpamMimic.com. This site allows users to encode and decode
<br>
secret text messages in what appears to be rambling spam messages. For example,
<br>
SpamMimic.com can produce a text message that looks like this: 
<br>
<p><p>Dear Friend , Especially for you - this breath-taking news . If you no longer
<br>
wish to receive our publications simply reply with a Subject: of &quot;REMOVE&quot; and
<br>
you will 
<br>
<p>immediately be removed from our club ! This mail is being sent in compliance
<br>
with Senate bill 1621 ; Title 6, Section 301 ! This is a ligitimate business
<br>
proposal ! Why work for somebody else when you can become rich in 54 months.... 
<br>
<p>(Note - the full message is longer than this paragraph and has been trimmed for
<br>
length. A complete copy of the message can be found in the appendix at the
<br>
bottom of this article.) 
<br>
<p><p>This seemingly incoherent advertisement can then be transmitted to anyone on the
<br>
Internet. For the average netizen, the message would undoubtedly find its way
<br>
into the trash folder, but for people who know that it's been encoded by
<br>
SpamMimic, they can go to the Web site, select the &quot;decode&quot; option, and submit
<br>
the full text (see appendix) to find this secret message: 
<br>
<p>Happy Halloween! 
<br>
<p><p>Of course, hiding brief text messages within larger text is limited by the
<br>
overall size of the larger text: text files simply aren't big enough to hide
<br>
more complex data like images or audio files. A solution to this dilemma can be
<br>
found in the availability of around 140 steganography software packages readily
<br>
available over the Internet. Free download sites have collections of various
<br>
steganography tools, including one called Invisible Secrets 3.0. Invisible
<br>
Secrets leads users through a series of easy steps that allows them to encode a
<br>
file secretly into another file. 
<br>
<p>As a demonstration, I've set up a simple Web page with three photos on it: 
<br>
<p>&lt; <a href="http://www.benton.org/DigitalBeat/stegdemo.html">http://www.benton.org/DigitalBeat/stegdemo.html</a> &gt;
<br>
<p>Here you'll see two photos that look identical to each other - a public domain
<br>
image of the space shuttle from NASA. The photo on the left is the original
<br>
image, while the photo on the right has been altered steganographically: I've
<br>
used the software Invisible Secrets 3.0 to hide a picture of my cat Winston
<br>
inside of it. The steganography software scatters the data of my cat photograph,
<br>
hiding that data amongst the bits and bytes that makes up the NASA photo. The
<br>
result of this process is the second copy of the NASA photo, a covert kitten
<br>
hidden within it, which I could share as publicly as I would like -- emailing it
<br>
to a listserv, placing it on my Web site, etc. To the unsuspecting viewer, it's
<br>
just a photo of the space shuttle, but to someone who knows I've altered it
<br>
steganographically, it's a secret envelope that can be used to deliver any piece
<br>
of data I'd like -- in this case, a picture of my cat. 
<br>
<p>Do Terrorists Dream of Steganographic Sheep: When Rumors Lead to Bad
<br>
Policymaking 
<br>
<p>Whether used for safeguarding business secrets, watermarking copyright-protected
<br>
data or just for personal amusement, steganography was largely seen as just
<br>
another aspect of Internet culture until the September 
<br>
11 attack. Though news outlets such as USA Today and Wired News had reported
<br>
earlier this year on speculation that terrorists like Osama bin Laden might use
<br>
steganographic software for encoding secret messages into publicly available
<br>
pornographic image files, rumors regarding such activities have caught on like
<br>
wildfire in the weeks following the attack. All of these reports had one thing
<br>
in common: they stated that authorities suspected that bin Laden and his
<br>
associates _might_ have used steganography. 
<br>
<p>There was no direct proof, however. Internet journalist Duncan Campbell reported
<br>
in the online magazine Telepolis that FBI officials stated in two successive
<br>
briefings that there was no evidence to suggest that terrorists had employed
<br>
steganography. To date, the only comment from a government official implying a
<br>
direct connection between terrorists and online steganography has come from an
<br>
unnamed source formerly connected to the French defense ministry. The source, as
<br>
noted in an October 30 story in the New York Times, claimed that a terrorist
<br>
suspect named Jamal Beghal used the technique to plan a failed bombing plot of
<br>
the U.S. embassy in Paris. Details about the alleged use of steganography remain
<br>
scant, however. 
<br>
<p>Declan McCullagh, Washington DC correspondent for Wired News as well as one of
<br>
the first journalists to report on allegations of terrorist online
<br>
steganography, was also skeptical of the recent reports. &quot;I've said in the past
<br>
that we should assume for purposes of political debate that terrorists will use
<br>
crypto and stego, because if they're not now, they eventually will,&quot; he wrote in
<br>
an email to his Politech e-newsletter. &quot;The September 11 attackers were cunning,
<br>
if nothing else. But there is a huge difference between expecting that
<br>
terrorists will eventually go in this direction -- and accepting as fact vague
<br>
and self-promoting reports that the 19 suicide-hijackers did.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Adding to this skepticism is a recent report from University of Michigan
<br>
computer scientists who scanned over two million online images for evidence of
<br>
hidden messages using special stego-detecting software they had developed. (The
<br>
art of detecting steganography, for those who are interested, is known as
<br>
steganalysis.) Their sweep of these two million images identified no trace of
<br>
steganography, whether for passing along secret orders between terrorist cells
<br>
or for passing along the Mrs. Fields cookie recipe. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I am not aware of evidence that indicates the use of encryption or
<br>
steganography,&quot; explains Neils Provos, one of the authors of the University of
<br>
Michigan study. &quot;The terrorist attacks are being used by some politicians as a
<br>
reason to pass legislation that they could not pass before.... There is no
<br>
indication that any encryption technology has been used.&quot; 
<br>
<p>As Provos and others point out, one of the greatest concerns among online civil
<br>
libertarians is that these unsubstantiated claims of terrorists using
<br>
steganography will serve as ammunition for politicians to put further
<br>
restrictions on both steganography and encryption. Civil libertarians are
<br>
already finding themselves being shouted down by policymakers determined to
<br>
expand government surveillance activities and clamp down on tools used for
<br>
hiding or scrambling information. In the Netherlands, legislators have moved to
<br>
regulate public use of strong encryption on the Internet, backing off on a 1998
<br>
policy memorandum that stated, &quot;The use of cryptography will remain
<br>
permissible.&quot; 
<br>
<p>In the United States, the sweeping anti-terrorism legislation signed into law by
<br>
President Bush on October 26, among other things, greatly expands the ability of
<br>
authorities to tap email accounts, access personal data and snoop through
<br>
electronic voice mail. &quot;This bill does not strike the right balance between
<br>
empowering law enforcement and protecting civil liberties,&quot; worried Sen. Russ
<br>
Feingold (D-WI), the only senator to vote against the legislation. &quot;I don't know
<br>
anybody in this country who's afraid of their law enforcement people at this
<br>
time -- they're afraid of terrorism,&quot; responded Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), one of
<br>
the key supporters of the new law. 
<br>
<p>The law contains many provisions that are profoundly frustrating to civil
<br>
libertarians, but this particular piece of legislation does not contain any
<br>
specific challenges to steganography. This is not to say that future legislation
<br>
will not attempt to curtail the rights of citizens to utilize or develop
<br>
steganography software, however. The very fact that these public allegations of
<br>
terrorists using steganography happen to contain a bizarrely seductive mix of
<br>
political issues that are close to the heart of many a legislator (namely
<br>
protecting national security and curtailing online pornography) suggests that
<br>
proposals to limit access to steganography could be just around the corner. 
<br>
<p>Of course, the passage of such proposals would lead to the next inevitable
<br>
question -- would anti-stego legislation actually serve their intended purpose?
<br>
If terrorists are indeed sophisticated enough to employ steganography software,
<br>
it would not be surprising if they also possessed the sophistication to develop
<br>
their own software should current stego tools become inaccessible, or if
<br>
investigative authorities were granted even greater access to the decoding keys
<br>
for these tools. So assuming that terrorists had the wherewithal to craft their
<br>
own steganography tools, the only people who would truly feel the effects of
<br>
anti-steg legislation would be law-abiding citizens who might wish to employ
<br>
steganography to protect their online private interests. Additionally, if you
<br>
consider the allegations regarding bin Laden's supposed use of old-fashioned
<br>
steganography in videotape broadcasts, cracking down on _online_ steganography
<br>
would do nothing to prevent terrorists or other criminal elements from using
<br>
more traditional, _analog_ means to pass along messages to each other. 
<br>
<p>Conclusion: Much Ado About Nothing? (or at least nothing visible without the
<br>
assistance of stego software...) 
<br>
<p>The media hype surrounding bin Laden, steganography and pornography make for
<br>
enticing copy -- but the stories published to date simply don't add up to actual
<br>
proof, let alone successfully demonstrate that changing the law to curtail
<br>
steganography would actually accomplish much in the war on terrorism. In these
<br>
trying times, it would be difficult to challenge the sincerity of lawmakers as
<br>
they use the tools at their disposal to combat terrorism and keep America safe.
<br>
Yet alongside their duty to help preserve the security of the country is the
<br>
equally important duty to recognize and preserve our civil liberties. This is no
<br>
truer than in times of war, when emotion, fear and the desire for swift justice
<br>
can cloud our constitutional judgment.
