<p>And what about those who prefer to manage their own individual
<br>
property?  What about those who have reason to believe that they'll be
<br>
discriminated against in any collective they're likely to have the
<br>
option of joining?
<br>
<p>Reminds me of a story.
<br>
<p>I was at a workshop of so-called anarchists (though for practical
<br>
purposes, socialists). I asked whether people would still have the
<br>
right to keep and bear arms in the society they envisioned. They
<br>
seemed incredulous that anybody would even want to. I asked it if
<br>
would be illegal, and of course it wouldn't be, just nobody would want
<br>
to make or procure weapons, since everything would be shared and blah
<br>
blah blah. So I asked what means other than illegalization they would
<br>
employ to insure that nobody would trade in weapons.
<br>
<p>Why would anybody want to?
<br>
<p>Sigh. Okay, just take it as a given that I like guns for whatever
<br>
unfathomable reason, and I've just opened a gun shop in the middle of
<br>
Socialismville. What now?
<br>
<p>The reply essentially was that the 'community' would initiate force to
<br>
deprive me of my property. Nobody contested this reply or even looked
<br>
like they were shocked by it.
<br>
<p>They can take socialism or liberalism or whatever new-wave gen-X name
<br>
they may decide to call it and shove it up their collective recti.
