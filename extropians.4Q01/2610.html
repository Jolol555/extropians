<p><em>&gt;Its not over until its over -- and it is unlikely to be

<em>&gt;the events of the last several months are the tip of the

<p>The great thing about pessimism is that there is always
<br>
tomorrow....
<br>
<p>The fact is that things are better, much much better today, and
<br>
with a little hard work can be even better tomorrow.
<br>
<p>Those who said it would be years, if ever, for these gains to be
<br>
accomplished were WRONG.
<br>
<p>The trick to defusing the fundamentalists is to make future plans
<br>
and scenarios all inclusive. Those who want to take part can and
<br>
those who don't want to can stay home and sulk.
<br>
<p>The battle is clearly on the side of advanced technology, bringing
<br>
along advanced ethics is also a good idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The best we may be able to hope for is minimal casualties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on both sides.  In that respect the news of the last couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of days has been heartening since we can get on with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;business of feeding people rather than bombing or shooting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not hopping for minimal casualities on the Taliban side or the
<br>
Al-Quaeda side.
<br>
<p>Message to Taliban/Al-Quaeda: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Soon All your base are belong to us.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>I'm glad the people of Afghanistan have a new beginning.
