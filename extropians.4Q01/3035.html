</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the current method (hands off except for in extreme circumstances such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the gun discussion moratorium in '99) is the best.
</em><br>
<p>The bilge that some have dumped on me is not contemptible?  I
<br>
hold it in great contempt.  If you want a formal complaint or
<br>
require one before you take notice then consider this a formal
<br>
complaint.  The treatment I have received from John Clark and
<br>
Mike Lorrey does not belong on a civilized list.  The list rule
<br>
says no personal attacks.  It has obviously been violated. 
<br>
Either the rule means something or it doesn't.  You decide.
<br>
<p>Not that I can't deal with such and ignore them largely.  But it
<br>
certainly does detract from my enjoyment and willingness to
<br>
participate and ability to share what I am actually here for. 
<br>
So, yes, I do experience such as a degradation of the list
<br>
personally.  Enough so that I have been tempted multiple times
<br>
of late to give this list up as a bad job.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;The responsibility for the destruction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;reputation of ExI, and of the list and all its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;participants does not, however, rest with John Clark,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;but with the list owners and their failure to insist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;on and enforce a standard of respect for the discourse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;in this forum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the list rules (which I will send separately after this message), there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a disclaimer that &quot;...Extropy Institute does not take responsibility for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the use or misuse of posts addressed to the extropians list.&quot;  While I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasionally discouraged by the level of discussion on this list, I beg to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differ that the reputation of ExI is being destroyed by the discourse on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list.  I don't see that as being the case at all; please let me know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how you feel this has been done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bottom line is this: am I happy that there have been ad hominem attacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this list over the past few days?  No, I'm not happy about it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.  However, I've paid close attention to the threads as they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progressed and don't feel that they need any administrative force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied.  For the record, the administrative process would be this: I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find (via forwarded complaint, offensive post etc.) something I felt to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an issue of concern.  I would then forward that to Max More so that he (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the board of Directors as well as VP Greg Burch) could determine whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not action should be taken.  Those measures would then be carried out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In short you have a bureaucracy, would have to file paperwork
<br>
and would greatly prefer not to be bothered.  OK. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If anyone has an issue with the way I have done my job, please let Max and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I have an issue with what looks like being rather defensive.  I
<br>
can handle the bullies and muckrackers but please don't tell me
<br>
that such is nothing that is against the rules of the list or
<br>
damaging to the list.  I can handle insults much more easily.
