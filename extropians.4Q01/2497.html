Another significant point about this sort of thing (some variants 
<br>
being known in some trades as &quot;The Motorman's Friend&quot;) is that one
<br>
does not completely void all the liquid; and though a healthy person's
<br>
urine is generally pretty near sterile while in the body, the same cannot
<br>
be said for it sitting around in a piece of ambient-exposed synthetic 
<br>
tubing, etc.
<br>
<p>Combine reflux (slosh) and the incomplete voiding of the bladder proper, 
<br>
the latter being quite likely for any male who has micturated while sitting 
<br>
on a firm surface, due to the geometry and location of the relevant
<br>
parts--you can easily get UTIs and such. Especially if you don't
<br>
completely switch out gear at the next rest stop, and strain the
<br>
lizard the old fashioned way to help rinse your personal plumbing out.
<br>
<p>Even minus the latex formfitting adaptor, things can get tricky for
<br>
guys who don't completely void. They sell things that look like melted
<br>
bud vases at aviation shops.
<br>
<p>Of course urination while sitting on the seat of a porcelain throne
<br>
doesn't present the same pressures (so to speak)--but it can present 
<br>
other challenges including geometry and hygiene concerns, depending.
<br>
<p>Oh, I got that pun in. Call me Mr. Happy!

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extrobikers, There is a product advertised on page 80 of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current issue {December 2001} of Rider magazine called the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; E-Z Leaker.  Before you go paying 49 dollars for such a device,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do read of my own attempt at such a thing about 16 years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soon after I got the Cavalcade, I noticed there was a drain hole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just aft of the gas filler.  If you overfill the tank, this tube drains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fuel harmlessly to the ground.  This gave me an idea.  Since I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often rode across the Mojave desert, and out in places like Death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Valley, where the temperature is often triple digits, {by 8 oclock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the morning, I might add} one does not like to stop for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason.  I drilled a hole in the bottom of the left glove box in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to insert a plastic tube.  I could then put a bag of ice in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the left saddlebag and run a tube up thru that hole in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drink profusely as I was riding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of the water thus ingested was eliminated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspiration, however some still needed to be drained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the traditional fashion.  Hoping to do so without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually stopping in the brutal heat, I fashioned a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invention not so different from the business end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EZ Leaker, using a device which can be purchased for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4 bits in many gas station restrooms.  Cutting off the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and using a rubber band to attach a piece of the plastic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tube, I inserted the other end of the tube into that gasoline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drain line and I was all set.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or so I thought.  On one of those triple digit summer days,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I set off across the desert, drinking the water as fast as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; melted, which is to say, extremely.  After an hour or so, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was ready to try out my new invention.  I tried, but nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened.  So I drank more and within half an hour nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was calling, loudly.  So once again I tried out my new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invention but once again no success, as my mind was telling me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in its own subtle way that my mind uses to tell me such things:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SPIKE you IDIOT!  You cannot piss while riding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a MOTORCYCLE!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was right of course.  It refused to allow the appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sphincter to relax.  Grimly determined to avoid wasting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 75 cents I had already invested in my clever invention,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I drank still more water and pressed on, until my brain was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the receiving end of another set of subtle signals, these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming from below:  SPIKE!  Pull this motorcycle over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOW and drain the radiator!  NOW!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I let these two fight it out for a while, and eventually the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower region won out.  {Doesnt it always?}  However
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was a most difficult and trying experience, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; furthermore, the aforementioned device from the gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; station is not actually designed for this particular usage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So let us just say &quot;one size fits none&quot; and leave it at that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So before you blow 49 bucks on the device presented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on page 80 of this month's Rider magazine,  do fashion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one yourself for 75 cents and see if you can make it work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any better than I was able to.
</em><br>
