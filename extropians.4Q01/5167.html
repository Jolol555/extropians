<em>&gt;     &gt;While I support free markets, I also support anti-dumping laws. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;degree to which the Indian government subsidizes its domestic computer
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;free trade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly dumping is free trade. If the Indian government wishes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsidize an industry it's foolish of them, and it harms the Indian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxpayer, but it benefits those it sells to. Selling things for less than it costs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make is not the key to success and the market will soon inform them of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, but if somebody is dumb enough to try it for a while who am I to say no.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dumping is stupid but I like to take advantage of the stupid, I think of it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution in action. Of course special interests, such as yourself, could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmed from time to time but most will benefit. At any rate if I want to buy

</em><br>
<p>Fine, and I can retaliate by paying your customers to do business with
<br>
other people as well, and require that all packets that pass through my
<br>
section of the network must be stopped and inspected, byte by byte,
<br>
before they are allowed to be passed on, and any packets that contain
<br>
the 'product' of those who compete unfairly with me will be spoofed with
<br>
identical packets with randomized data.
<br>
<p>What I find so ironic about this sort of discussion is that those
<br>
companies who are now advertising the most here in the US for consumers
<br>
to 'invest' in America by buying American products after 9-11 are those
<br>
who most frequently are exporting jobs to third world countries. There
<br>
is nothing wrong with exporting jobs per se, but there is something
<br>
ethically wrong with the demonstrated hypocrisy of pleading with
<br>
consumers to stay loyal to American corporations at the same time.
<br>
<p>This is not exclusive to corporations. Many non-profit agencies are
<br>
doing the same, especially those who are involved in servicing the
<br>
unemployed. I suppose in a twisted way it is smart to help ensure you
<br>
have 'customers' by making sure they are less able to become employed,
<br>
in the same way that the anti-nuke movement is against the dismantlement
<br>
of the Trident missile submarines now that their missiles have been
<br>
removed.
<br>
<p>India not only gives free college educations to all Indian citizens
<br>
majoring in computer sciences and other high tech fields, it grants tax
<br>
breaks to Indian businesses that hire Indians, and they also have
<br>
barriers against immigration as well, so another person's suggestion
<br>
that I move to India is not a possibility.
<br>
<p>And, no, John, dumping is NOT free trade if the government is
<br>
subsidizing the market. That is not to say that our own is innocent.
<br>
FedEx, for example, is the number one overnight delivery service
<br>
specifically because all of its large jets are financed through the
<br>
federal government at very low interest rates as part of the Reserve
<br>
Transport Service program (i.e. the planes are subject to being called
<br>
up in wartime like any reservist.)
<br>
<p>Dumping is predatory trade, and is typical of monopolists. I'd like to
<br>
see what sort of world would occur if we instituted a Trade Reciprocity
<br>
Act, where every trade regulation another country has with respect to
<br>
our products is mirrored by us with respect to their products. For
<br>
example, the reason cars built by US firms have never gained any market
<br>
share in Japan is that the Japanese, for 'quality' reasons, essentially
<br>
requires that every US car that is imported be 'inspected', i.e.
<br>
entirely dismantled and put back together at the port when it comes off
<br>
the boat, with the cost of this passed on to the buyer in the sticker
<br>
price.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, think about the costs of dumping that are externalized:
<br>
foreign company A dumps its products on our market, which drives
<br>
domestic company B, C and D into bankruptcy, passing the debts of those
<br>
companys onto the US taxpayer. By endorsing dumping, you are not only
<br>
increasing your own taxes, you externalize the money you save on cheap
<br>
products into everyone else's pockets. That's not very free market OR
<br>
libertarian of you.
