<p>That is interesting.  Actually a suitcase nuke would make an
<br>
altogether too effective terror weapon.  It is one of my worse
<br>
nightmares.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Bioweapons are the terrorists dream come true however;
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Are you claiming the above is a blanket goal of all terrorists
<br>
or some terrorists?  Clearly not all terrorism is  done for any
<br>
religious goal whatsoever and not all terrorism has the intent
<br>
to slay as many people as possible and especially not all
<br>
terrorism wishes to slay all who do not think and believe like
<br>
the terrorists do.  So I don't see why you wrote this
<br>
paragraph.  What is it you want to say here?
<br>
<p>Unless you have a bioweapon that is real deadly and fast acting
<br>
but not too much so unless it self-check its own spread and can
<br>
manage to distribute it really well and keep it from backfiring
<br>
on your own population, a bioweapon is a really poor choice for
<br>
wiping out all of a particular people or type of people.  Even
<br>
if that is your goal.
