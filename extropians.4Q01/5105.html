<em>&gt; A couple carrying a deleterious allele had a kid suffering a gruesome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condition, Fanconi's anemia. He can possibly be saved with stem cells from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a histocompatible source; the plausible candidate is placental cord stem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells from a new sibling. So the parents are petitioning for the right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use IVF technology to prepare a number of in vitro blastocytes, screen them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to remove those with the genetical anomaly, then implant a healthy one. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due course, they'll have another child spared the disorder, and his or her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cord blood will provide the cure for the existing dying child. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TV news reports of this issue are speaking of the proposal as `genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering' (rather than, say, screening for healthy embryos). Monash's Dr
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alan Trounson is wearily for it, but you can see the poor fellow tiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the ceaseless barrage. It doesn't seem to occur to the nitwits that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *no* alterations are being proposed in the new baby's genome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naturally the reporters all babble about `playing god' and `feeling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolted'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this mischievous, or maybe just ignorant, misuse of words needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be combatted every time it arises. Of course, maybe it's better to let it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run unchecked... because then by the time people *are* doing real genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering, the boy will have cried wolf so often everyone will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heartily sick of the silly noise.

<p>I recently saw a documentary where a couple had gone through with this exact 
<br>
scenario. I forget when and where, but I believe it to be the first case. 
<br>
The subject wasn't described as genetic engineering and was shown in a 
<br>
positive light. The program itself was dedicated to genetics and this 
<br>
particular section seemed to be given as &quot;evidence for&quot; applied genetic based 
<br>
medicine, rather than the usual &quot;THE TOMATOES WILL GROW FEET AND KILL US !!!&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I remember the Boy who received the cord blood is now around 13 
<br>
and healthy. What interested me the most was the family dynamic that had 
<br>
grown around the sibbling who's blood was used. As I remember it was a girl 
<br>
and she was treated by her 'now cured' brother and parrents as a gift and 
<br>
greatly loved by all.
<br>
She an unwanted child that they just had to deal with or get adopted, or even 
<br>
chopped into easily usable parts and kept in the freezer until another 
<br>
'Wanted' family member needed a spare part.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing. I was really shocked, as the media must have been. in fact I 
<br>
think they must have been shocked into silence.
<br>
