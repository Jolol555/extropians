<p>You must be a new subscriber, because you've obviously missed my
<br>
previous comments about this myth. The 'oil will run out in 20-40 years'
<br>
myth is based on a lack of understanding about what this number
<br>
represents. When this number is reported, it is based on the estimates
<br>
of oil reserves that are *known* and *recoverable* at the current market
<br>
price. As the price drops, the amount of available oil drops. As the
<br>
price rises, the amount 'available' also rises. Because, outside of
<br>
artificial fluctuations induced by cartel enforced political agendas,
<br>
market dynamics generally work more often than not, there is ALWAYS
<br>
somewhere around a 20-40 year supply of oil available. There was 40
<br>
years of oil available in 1970, and there is 40 years available today,
<br>
despite the fact that the estimate of 1970 meant we should only have ten
<br>
years of oil left.
<br>
<p>As prices rise, and as currently exploited reserves run out, other
<br>
reserves are opened to pumping which are competetive in the market, and
<br>
companies explore for more reserves and make estimates about what the
<br>
cost per barrel such new reserves would be to recover. As technology
<br>
advances, the cost of recovering deeper, more remote reserves drops, so
<br>
more reserves become market competetive as older reserves are used up.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, there does seem to be a degree of replenishment of oil in
<br>
older fields. It is theorized that oil is mostly produced by
<br>
extremophilic bacteria deep in the ground reacting with geothermal
<br>
originated energy. There is a small but significant market for reopening
<br>
long abandoned wells to cheaply recover oil at lower production rates
<br>
which has refilled the salt domes and sand strata where oil collects as
<br>
it percolates up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then ofcourse must be a strong political movement against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raising of nuclear power plants, because it will probably end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in similiar political lobby, but far more desructive.
</em><br>
<p>How? Please explain how the nuclear industry is more dangerous to human
<br>
life and health than the petrochemicals industry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway, good idea for powering sattelites, beaming energy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth is too dangerous (some SF author already discussed this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he been afraid of beam errors)
</em><br>
<p>No, it isn't. It does have the potential to be used as a weapon given
<br>
the proper alterations, but outside of that, it is not dangerous. Used
<br>
normally, beam intensity allows for normal plant forms to grow under and
<br>
around such antennae.
