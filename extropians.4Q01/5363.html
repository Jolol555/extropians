<p>
Beginning Jan. 5, NASA-sponsored teams at 200 high schools will start building
<br>
robots in a nationwide annual competition aimed toward a national championship
<br>
at Disney World in April.
<br>
The NASA-sponsored teams will join hundreds of others in constructing robots
<br>
that will compete in regional contests and a final, national competition in
<br>
April at Disney World's EPCOT Center, Orlando, Fla. Students at the competing
<br>
schools will be challenged to design a robot that will complete a specified
<br>
set of tasks within rules to be outlined next week.
<br>
The robotics project will kick off at the Verizon Center in Manchester, N.H.,
<br>
with a demonstration of the task for this year's regional and national
<br>
competitions. Rules, goals and other details, such as the layout of the
<br>
playing field, will be revealed during NASA TV's broadcast of the ceremony.
<br>
Detailed requirements of the robotic games are carefully guarded until
<br>
announced at the kickoff event.
<br>
-------------
<br>
&quot;Education is key to the success of our country, and this approach represents
<br>
one of the most powerful ways to get students motivated,&quot; said Mark Leon,
<br>
project manager of the Robotics Education Project <a href="http://robotics.nasa.gov/">http://robotics.nasa.gov/</a> at
<br>
NASA's Ames Research Center, in California's Silicon Valley. &quot;Some of these
<br>
student may go on to help NASA engage in bold new missions of exploration of
<br>
our solar system. The idea here is to involve students in hands-on activities
<br>
to turn them on to science and math.&quot;

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual

uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,

non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
