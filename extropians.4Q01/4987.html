<p>
Can someone post some evidence one way or the other to clarify Mike's 
<br>
claim that software jobs flowing to India from the USA are caused by 
<br>
a distortion of the free market, as opposed to natural market forces? 
<br>
Mike?
<br>
<p>The strong US dollar has certainly benefited the local film 
<br>
industries in Australia and New Zealand (and Canada). The fact that 
<br>
the Aussie dollar is worth about .50c to the US dollar makes us very 
<br>
cost competitive for film production (e.g., The Matrix). It would be 
<br>
interesting to work-out how much the Lord of the Rings would have 
<br>
cost if it was filmed in the USA rather than New Zealand.
<br>
<p>On the surface it would seem to me that software jobs in the US would 
<br>
be even more vulnerable to the strength of the US dollar. Why pay 
<br>
someone X US dollars to hack in LA when a perfectly competent 
<br>
programmer can be paid closer to half-X in Melbourne (and still be 
<br>
afforded the same lifestyle -- the cost of an espresso is about $A2 
<br>
in Melbourne or $US2 in LA). Presumably the same $$$ will go even 
<br>
further in places like India (and Israel)?
<br>
<p>I would have thought that it was a great success of both technology 
<br>
and the free market that programmers in New Delhi, Tel Aviv, or 
<br>
Melbourne can benefit from competing directly with programmers in 
<br>
Maine. Onward! TANSTAAFL!
<br>
<p>P.
