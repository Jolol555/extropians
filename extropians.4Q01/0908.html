<p>Sorry, I missed a comma. Entanglement creates violation of light speed
<br>
limits. Just because I signalled someone instantaneously 1 light year
<br>
away with an entangled pair doesn't mean that they can communicate with
<br>
me in my past with the same signal. If they turned around immediately
<br>
after I signalled them and sent it back instantaneously, their signal
<br>
would still arrive after I had sent my first signal. No communicating
<br>
with the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>And just how would this occur?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Next, have this second party change

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>These ideas about communicating with the past via exceeding light speed
<br>
are a misperception caused by too much Star Trek watching.
<br>
<p>There is an absolute frame of reference in at least one dimension. For
<br>
example, we all know the Big Bang occured at some point in the past.
<br>
Temporally speaking, therefore, we can all deal relativistically with
<br>
each other in reference to the Big Bang event, so in the dimension of
<br>
time, there IS an absolute frame of reference. This is essentially what
<br>
occurs when we are x many light years from each other. We may experience
<br>
more time than others due to our relative veolcities (even then, the
<br>
rate of temporal passage occurs in reference to actual zero velocity.
<br>
This is an interesting question to ask: Just what frame of reference
<br>
results in the fastest possible passage of time? Is this determined by
<br>
the velocities of the majority of the matter in your local region, your
<br>
galactic arm, or your galaxy? If all matter in the universe is screaming
<br>
away from all other matter, which one has the frame of reference with
<br>
the fastest possible passage of time?)
