<p>EAFV, that's brilliant. I wish there was some kind of strategic tip line...
<br>
or does that .gov site soliciting consultation double as that? (just got
<br>
confirmation of my account from them, but not enough time to check out
<br>
their guideliknes yet).

<em>&gt; wreck havoc especially if they have nuclear weapons....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -America depends on foreign oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -A terrorist from the middle east would not want to destroy their own oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing capacity  only disable the ability of the USA to use it to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Each attack to have the most effectiveness should be both catastrophic in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of economic destruction and human life as well as not a repeat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous ones (for most surprise/fear/terror effect).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Let's for discussion purposes assume that nuclear weapons are in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists possession.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if several oil tankers  are surreptitiosly fitted with warheads.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if the origin is not important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if several tanker nukes are similtaneously at several USA port
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refineries, close enough to the actual refinery so that a blast would level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the refinery, as well as decimate the surrounding city.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -If I were to invoke such a senario it might most likely happen when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heaviest petrochemical use occurs... early to mid winter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if I were looking for another attack on the USA it would be between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christmas and New year (the real start of the new millenium) and I would look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for unusual methods of delivery such as oil tankers?????
