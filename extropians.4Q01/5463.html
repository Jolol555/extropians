<p>OK. So in your view cops are better for those enumerable reasons.
<br>
I don't want to argue the matter, I just wanted to know where you stand. Thank you.
<br>
I think training is mandatory, along with practice that police seldom get.
<br>
So in a funny way, my standards are higher than yours.

</em><br>
<p>Fine. In the long long run, we don't disagree much--but I won't cry if that
<br>
vision turns out to be unattainable. I can settle for less.
<br>
<p>Here's what I want: I want to help create a world where tech is just tech and where 
<br>
how anyone shapes the atoms mostly doesn't matter. You made a gun? How cute!
<br>
We are not there now, hm? Confusing the two (now, and that ideal future) 
<br>
can lead to very bad mistakes. Getting there from here might not be a straight line.
<br>
I accept this. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; See, I don't accept that a free and liberal society has to be so

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are in utter agreement on this point, as written. There are a bunch of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think I never shall.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see. Do you carry a gun? Why? How would you feel without it? Why?
</em><br>
<p>What? You've missed my previous statements to you that provide direct answers
<br>
to your questions. 
<br>
<p>-No, I do not presently carry a gun when I'm just walking around.
<br>
-So &quot;Why?&quot; does not apply. 
<br>
-&quot;Without it&quot; could mean lots of things. If you mean without _carrying_ it,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the answer is &quot;I'd feel exactly the way I feel right now&quot;, because of my first answer.
<br>
-So the second &quot;Why?&quot; is answered &quot;because there is no change between the two conditions&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I hear reports that there are _some_ highschools where _some_ students
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are criminals who carry firearms, and there are _other_ (scared) students
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could change it. That is at present beyond my powers. It sucks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You mean, rather than solving the problem, you try to cure the symptoms by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreading the desease? May be I am to european to find this a very logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way...
</em><br>
<p>No, that is not what I mean at all. I report the state of affairs. I am not God.
<br>
I said it was beyond my power to change, not that I made it happen.
<br>
If I had a magic button I could press that would eliminate all weapons everywhere,
<br>
I would think hard and long about pressing it, not dismiss the idea out of hand.
<br>
<p>But I would suspect there might be Faust's price to pay. Because I'm not God.
<br>
<p>Today, in the world as it is, guns in the US appear to save many more lives than they take.
<br>
But let's not have an argument about that statement. Take it up with Mike Lorrey,
<br>
he loves to deal with it. And please take it up on his list. That's simple politeness,
<br>
the issue has been done to death here. So to speak.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have heard this argument before: &quot;The minorities&quot; are far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; violent and criminal than the rest. [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Minorities being more unhappy, or violent, or criminal, is a really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complex topic. I don't feel qualified to discuss it, and so I don't bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pardon, but we will not come very far with &quot;Dünnbrettbohren&quot; (avoiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex topics).
</em><br>
<p>It was a complete side point to what I was talking about. Effectively a red herring
<br>
as far as this thread goes. Start a new thread, and maybe I'll have something to say someday.
<br>
<p>How far do we get if people discuss it who don't know what they'd be talking about?
<br>
<p>This is what I have admitted. Lately I am less willing to talk like an expert 
<br>
when I am not an expert. Thinking about this topic is hard. Spouting rhetoric 
<br>
about it is easy. I grow fatigued with that. When I have something to say, I'll
<br>
say it. That's the very best I can do.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Someone also suggested that the reason for the different crime rates is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the inhomogeneity(?) of the US society compared to a more homogeneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Europe. Hm. But the &quot;majority&quot; also consists of former minorities, here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; as well as in the US, correct? Unless you propose that the &quot;new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; minorities&quot; are intrinsically more violent than the &quot;old&quot;, what magic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; turned a mixture of minorities into a homogeneous, peaceful, law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; abiding majority?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't answer that, since I am not confident of the premise and never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; claimed the premise as mine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Too bad. I thought this could be a promising way of discussion.
</em><br>
<p>When I say I am not confident of the premise, 
<br>
here I mean that the model seems too simple. 
<br>
<p>I must therefore confine myself to 
<br>
remarking that argumentation in this medium, as well as in general, is poorly
<br>
suited to dealing with webs of interacting cause and effect factors.
<br>
<p>Claiming that there is a single or even predominant cause requires one to hold
<br>
too many other things constant for me to believe that it's any more relevant
<br>
than trying to find out what piece of the brain holds the location of the cheese
<br>
in a trained rat. These &quot;wicked problems&quot; are hard, or we don't undertand them,
<br>
which makes them worse than hard.
<br>
<p>Talk to me in five years, after I've coded my &quot;weather simulator&quot; where many of the
<br>
factors can be wired up, and maybe I'll at least be able to tell you I am no closer to
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p>Right now, my choice is to cop out, or to spout bullshit. I choose the former over the latter.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; A fair question. I have no final answer. I agree the question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important, and am happy to see that we agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A very good question. I wish you luck and courage in finding an answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that satisfies you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you really try to sneak away so soon? 
</em><br>
<p>I do not sneak away. I seek, and I acknowledge my limitations as humbly as I can.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Now, what about the glorious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future of &lt;you-name-it&gt; technology, when you can't use it because someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could misuse it to kill you?
</em><br>
<p>I have a very hard time comprehending this sentence.
<br>
<p>Here is what your question turns into when I plug in a specific example:
<br>
<p>Kai, paraphrased: [Now, what about the glorious future of superpencils, when MMB can't use a superpencil because someone
<br>
could stick it in MMB's brain(--through MMB's eye or ear or soft palate or...) and kill MMB?]
<br>
<p>I don't understand the &quot;because&quot;.
<br>
<p>Do you mean &quot;when I will be prevented from having a superpencil because [some unknown person] 'prevents' me&quot;?
<br>
<p>If that's what you mean, all I can say is, it depends, exactly as it would today.
<br>
<p>As you have said, I've been focusing on the here and now. I did this because I find it an easy thing to talk about: it's
<br>
here, it's now; I trust some people you don't trust, and now I know a little better how we differ. But I do think about
<br>
the far future.
<br>
<p>MMB ON DESIRABLE FUTURES
<br>
<p>I want a civilization where no one who chooses membership has to fear very much at all--where practically no *thing* (up
<br>
to, say, the size of a planet) is anything like as dangerous as a modern bathroom in the industrialized world, and where
<br>
anyone with any excessive fear might be pitied but is still respected and protected, and listened to. And where people
<br>
who don't join are somehow not persecuted, and where there is still adventure for those who seek it. The freedom to
<br>
LEAVE. And come back. Freely.
<br>
<p>What do I guess might be involved?
<br>
<p>Ubiquitous available cheap redundant distributed copies of people, strong customs of honor, respect and a willingness to
<br>
leave others alone because they almost _can't_ hurt you, no matter what atoms they happen to collect in what patterns.
<br>
Exceptions for whatever few dangers remain, carefully limited by custom and with an ongoing and like minded approach
<br>
(don't legislate, create a real solution). Possibly smart contracts and &quot;blue goo&quot;. Possibly Eliezer's Friendly AI/SI.
<br>
Possibly an Extrosattva movement.
<br>
<p>What might doing this take? At least more competent people, more justified trust, wisdom, luck, criticism, lateral
<br>
thinking, diplomacy, integrity, courage, kindness, skepticism.
<br>
<p>But the above is the dream I have; one ideal aim, not an entry in my appointment book. 
<br>
It might turn out to be impossible. So, quite independent of my dream, I have an intention.
<br>
<p>My intention is to do my best to help create a civilization
<br>
--that I would not mind coming back to, AND
<br>
--that wouldn't mind bringing me back,
<br>
in that order of importance.
<br>
<p>I am too limited today to have a grand detailed plan to lay out. I know my limitations.
<br>
I have no idea if the path will be a nice monotonic curve, or if there will be glitches.
<br>
Assuming that I know the path seems very naive or delusional to me.
<br>
If you don't share these limitations, good for you. Maybe I'll meet you there.
<br>
<p>For now, though, if you want me to provide a snappy final answer, or a fight, I have neither one for you. 
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
<p>MMB
