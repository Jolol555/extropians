<p>Well, that settles it then....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;These acts took place within the borders of the continental U.S.,

<p>And these standards are of course unflawed....

</em><br>
<em>&gt;They most certainly did slink away rather than face the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Their associates will not be able to slink away.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm....Then why did you invent all those stealth aircraft, if not to 
<br>
&quot;slink&quot; in, do the damage, then &quot;slink away&quot; again?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;The 9/11 fanatics and some of their still living buddies are,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;A matter of your own opinion, and in violation of your own
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;By our standards they are cowards,

<p>Oh, they're _our_ standards now?  How kind, you saved us the trouble of
