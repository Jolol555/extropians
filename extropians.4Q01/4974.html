<br>
: Adrafinil is the only other drug in the same class as Modafinil
<br>
(&quot;eugorics&quot;
<br>
: I believe), and was actually a primitive version of Modafinil.  Adrafinil

in

targeting
<br>

I

<br>
: &gt;&gt; In addition to its wakefulness-promoting effects and increased

locomotor
<br>
: &gt;&gt; activity in animals, in humans, PROVIGIL produces psychoactive and
<br>
: &gt;&gt; euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, and thinking, and
<br>

<br>

<br>

unlikely

<br>
:
<br>
: One of the hallmarks of eugorics is that the effect is largely
<br>
unnoticeable.
<br>
: This has made them unpopular in the recreational drug world.  Several
<br>
: western militaries have adopted modafinil, citing very good real world
<br>
: performance and a lot of evidence suggesting far fewer long-term
<br>
: consequences (e.g. brain damage) than the amphetamine type drugs
<br>
previously
<br>
: used.  The basic operational subtlety from a military standpoint is that
<br>
: amphetamines prevent sleep, whereas eugorics eliminate the need to sleep.
<br>
: As I recall, one of the features that the military liked with modafinil
<br>
was
<br>
: that most people on it had the ability to sleep at will regardless of
<br>
where
<br>
: they were in their dosing cycle.  This greatly aided in the use of
<br>
unnatural
<br>
: and irregular sleep schedules without significant reductions in
<br>
performance.

: This is all from memory, though, so I could be mistaken.
