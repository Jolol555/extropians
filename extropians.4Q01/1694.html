<em>&gt; Suppose we lived in a world in which copy protection of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be achieved....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then I would propose that this would lead to the optimal allocation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources for the production of information and other goods....
</em><br>
<p>So how do you propose to measure the immense loss of valuable goods
<br>
from those people who would have made use of a larger public domain
<br>
of art and ideas to create, but who were priced out?  Your argument
<br>
assumes that &quot;creative&quot; works appear ex nihilo, and that they have
<br>
some inherent value, both of which I can't agree with.  Creative
<br>
works are worthless.  They only have value when there is demand, and
<br>
you can only create demand by exposure to similar works or to the
<br>
products or research.  As for patents, it is very likely that the
<br>
people best able to make good products from an invention, and those
<br>
best able to market those products, are not the inventors or those
<br>
hired by the inventors.  By limiting the use of the invention to
<br>
&quot;authorized&quot; uses, you effective shut out the imaginations of the
<br>
billions of people who might have come up with better uses for the
<br>
idea, or slightly better crafted products, or slightly derivative
<br>
works of great value.
