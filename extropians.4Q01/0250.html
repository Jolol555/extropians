<p>
Plague, the disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis (Y pestis), has
<br>
had a profound impact on human history. In AD 541, the first great plague
<br>
pandemic began in Egypt and swept over the world in the next four years.
<br>
<p>Population losses attributable to plague during those years were between 50
<br>
and 60 percent. In 1346, the second plague pandemic, also known as the Black
<br>
Death or the Great Pestilence, erupted and within 5 years had ravaged the
<br>
Middle East and killed more than 13 million in China and 20-30 million in
<br>
Europe, one third of the European population.
<br>
<p>Advances in living conditions, public health and antibiotic therapy make
<br>
such natural pandemics improbable, but plague outbreaks following an attack
<br>
with a biological weapon do pose a serious threat.
<br>
<p>Plague is one of very few diseases that can create widespread panic
<br>
following the discovery of even a small number of cases. This was apparent
<br>
in Surat, India, in 1994, when an estimated 500,000 persons fled the city in
<br>
fear of a plague epidemic.
<br>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. and Soviet biological weapons programs
<br>
developed techniques to directly aerosolize plague particles, a technique
<br>
that leads to pneumonic plague, an otherwise uncommon, highly lethal and
<br>
potentially contagious form of plague. A modern attack would most probably
<br>
occur via aerosol dissemination of Y pestis, and the ensuing outbreak would
<br>
be almost entirely pneumonic plague.
<br>
<p>More than 10 institutes and thousands of scientists were reported to have
<br>
worked with plague in the former Soviet Union.
<br>
<p>Given the availability of Y pestis in microbe banks around the world,
<br>
reports that techniques for mass production and aerosol dissemination of
<br>
plague have been developed, the high fatality rate in untreated cases and
<br>
the potential for secondary spread, a biological attack with plague is a
<br>
serious concern.
<br>
<p>An understanding of the epidemiology, clinical presentation and the
<br>
recommended medical and public health response following a biological attack
<br>
with plague could substantially decrease the morbidity and mortality of such
<br>
an event.
<br>
<p>A plague outbreak developing after the use of a biological weapon would
<br>
follow a very different epidemiologic pattern than a naturally occurring
<br>
plague epidemic.
<br>
<p>The size of a pneumonic plague epidemic following an aerosol attack would
<br>
depend on a number of factors, including the amount of agent used, the
<br>
meteorological conditions and methods of aerosolization and dissemination.
<br>
<p>A group of initial pneumonic cases would appear in about 1-2 days following
<br>
the aerosol cloud exposure, with many people dying quickly after symptom
<br>
onset. Human experience and animal studies suggest that the incubation
<br>
period in this setting is 1 to 6 days.
<br>
<p>A 1970 World Health Organization assessment asserted that, in a worst case
<br>
scenario, a dissemination of 50 kg of Y pestis in an aerosol cloud over a
<br>
city of 5 million might result in 150,000 cases of pneumonic plague,
<br>
80,000-100,000 of which would require hospitalization, and 36,000 of which
<br>
would be expected to die.
<br>
<p>There are no effective environmental warning systems to detect an aerosol
<br>
cloud of plague bacilli, and there are no widely available rapid, diagnostic
<br>
tests of utility. The first sign of a bioterrorist attack with plague would
<br>
most likely be a sudden outbreak of patients presenting with severe
<br>
symptoms.
<br>
<p>A U.S. licensed vaccine exists and in a pre-exposure setting appears to have
<br>
some efficacy in preventing or ameliorating bubonic disease. The mortality
<br>
of untreated pneumonic plague approaches 100%.
<br>
<p>Research and development efforts for a vaccine that protects against
<br>
inhalationally acquired pneumonic plague are ongoing. A number of promising
<br>
antibiotics and intervention strategies in the treatment and prevention of
<br>
plague infection have yet to be fully explored experimentally.
<br>
<p>Given that naturally occurring antibiotic resistance is rare and the lack of
<br>
confirmation of engineered antibiotic resistance, the Working Group believes
<br>
initial treatment recommendations should be based on known drug efficacy,
<br>
drug availability and ease of administration.
<br>
<p>People with household or face-to-face contacts with known pneumonic cases
<br>
should immediately initiate antibiotic prophylaxis and, if exposure is
<br>
ongoing, should continue it for 7 days following the last exposure.
<br>
<p>In addition to antibiotic prophylaxis, people with established ongoing
<br>
exposure to a patient with pneumonic plague should wear simple masks and
<br>
should have patients do the same.

<p><p><em>&gt; Hoo boy.  Not sure where this is from, but interesting if true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bubonic plague genome is &quot;unusually fluid&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 19:00  03  October  01
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Debora MacKenzie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bubonic plague, the bacterium blamed for the Black Death of medieval
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe and now a potential biological weapon, has had its entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genome sequenced. The genes seem to be &quot;unusually fluid&quot;, readily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-arranging themselves and picking up new genes from other microbes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That could mean that more virulent strains of plague might emerge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More ominously, it suggests that enhanced strains might be relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy to develop as weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bacillus that causes bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis, commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infects rodents in Asia, Africa and the Americas. But it occasionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreads to humans, with lethal effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does so by infecting both insects and mammals. Fleas that feed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infected rodents swallow the bacteria, which infect and block their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; midguts. The starving fleas feed voraciously, but only regurgitate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the blood they try to swallow - along with the bacteria. So plague
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreads among rodents, often causing only mild disease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the infected flea bites a human, however, up to half the victims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die, unless treated with antibiotics. If the bacteria invade the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lungs of such patients, and they cough them out, nearby people may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catch &quot;pneumonic&quot; plague. This is always fatal without treatment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pneumonic plague is the form feared as a potential biological weapon,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it can be released as an aerosol and can spread directly among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, without the intervention of fleas. The Soviet Union developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a plague weapon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Pathogenicity islands&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The gene sequence of Yersinia pestis, produced by Julian Parkhill of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Sanger Centre in Cambridge, UK and colleagues, shows how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bacillus learned to infect both insects and mammals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It picked up genes directly from baculoviruses that infect insects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including one for a toxin that damages the midgut. It also acquired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pathogenicity islands&quot;, assemblages of genes from other bacteria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that help cause human disease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The sequence also reveals novel surface molecules, which might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide new ways to attack plague. But &quot;this genome displays unusual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fluidity,&quot; comment Stewart Cole and Carmen Buchreiser in Nature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the genome is published. Numerous Yersinia genes have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copied backwards and have swapped positions within the genome,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes creating different variants in the same population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These recombinations could mean differences in virulence in a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; batch of plague, they note. That could also mean that the bacteria -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or bioweapons developers - have the genes at their disposal for new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and potentially nastier strains of disease.
