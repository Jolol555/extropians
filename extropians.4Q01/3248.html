</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The recent debate about US interventions in other countries is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the lack of non-US citizens on this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, hey, I was going to write something along this line in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta &quot;this list has gone to the dogs&quot; post earlier, but gave up half way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just couldn't be bothered with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but what the hell. I lurk, I used to write to this list years and years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and YEARS ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I stopped a while ago as the list became saturated with a vicious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right-wing mindset,
</em><br>
<p>I assume that Ned includes me in that mindset. I can counter by saying
<br>
that I know more extropians who do not sub to this list anymore (as
<br>
opposed to those who still do) specifically because it has become
<br>
inundated by left winger socialist types in the last 3 years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which I'm sure I could spend the rest of my life arguing against, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be that long, so I'd rather have one than spend all my time arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with maniacs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The impression I have gotten is that a hell of a lot of other people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, leaving the list overpopulated with maniacs.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but apparently not the maniacs you are thinking of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most New Zealanders do not mind US interventions _as long as_ they see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; America is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not acting in its own interests and that it is acting altruistically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is, does *anyone* beleve america acts altruistically? Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it does, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered dubious by most people. The Gulf War is a classic example.
</em><br>
<p>What surprises me is that the moral relativists have such difficultly
<br>
grasping the idea that just because America doesn't act according to
<br>
YOUR principles that it doesn't act according to its own as IT
<br>
understands them (NOT YOU). I'd think that people with such allegedly
<br>
broad minds would be able to grasp, embrace, and even apologize for such
<br>
things before breakfast.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That said, the opinions of New Zealanders are sadly based on (a) what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; NZers tell them to think (b) What they see on Tv
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have just described 90% of the Western world.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but we don't all watch the same TV channels, do we? Some of us live
<br>
where most of the available media is not funded or produced by the
<br>
government to fit its own agenda.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An example is East Timor. Recently, during the lead up to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vote, when Timorese were being terrorised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by Indonesian militias, there were calls in this country by pacifist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lefties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the US to liberate East Timor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The US actually offered troops to supervise the elections and that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebuffed by Australia and others. These troops were then frantically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the shit actually *did* go down, but I found it highly interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other than the initial newspaper report, this has never been mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia since then
</em><br>
<p>Of course not. Popular world opinion is that either a) US military
<br>
forces are a bunch of murderous raping criminals, or else b) that they
<br>
are effete pampered pansies who can't put their combat boots on right,
<br>
compared to the military in their own particular country. In either
<br>
case, it's obviously embarrassing to be seen asking for such infantry to
<br>
join your particular cause.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also, the various anti-american americans on the list miss the point-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is reacting to the &quot;intervention&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by Osama bin Ladens forces on its soil, so the retaliation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clearly different to other interventions in the past.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, allegedly retaliating, we have yet to see any evidence.
</em><br>
<p>After the NA forces complaining that we were not bombing enough to the
<br>
western press (I found it so hilarious that the US tv media was trying
<br>
to embarrass the Bush administration by reporting the NA recommendations
<br>
that we carpet bomb MORE villages).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is significant that the various and bloody Soviet interventions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never demonised in teh same way as american actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ??? You are joking, aren't you? There was a huge global outcry, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moscow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Olympics were torpedoed, etc.
</em><br>
<p>We, the US, torpedoed the Moscow olympics by staying home, but I don't
<br>
recall many other countries staying home. Perhaps you can provide more
<br>
info.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It may or may not be significant that Samantha assumes responsibiltiy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all actions by individuals in the US govt for the past 50 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She's a spook!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see it as two aspects, there's the American *people* and there's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *govt* which I think is a tool of big business and international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will simply bail when it gets too awkward, much as they bailed out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it got sticky in the middle of last century. A lot of people blame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US *people* whereas a lot of the americans I know complain bitterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how they feel that they have lost control of their govt to business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately the NYC attack was aimed at the people and not the govt.
</em><br>
<p>Many more of us feel we've lost control of our government to NGO special
<br>
interests funded by millionaire/billionaire aristocrats like Ted Turner
<br>
and Andrew MacKelvey.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The proper role for US foreign policy is to operate by principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefit to US (these 2 are not mutually exclusive) . I am not sure why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not so since in new zealand the govt has often pursued an idealistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; policy at cost to our relations with other countries eg the Labour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; govts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stance on nukes in 1985 resulting in terrorism by France on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rainbow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Warrior and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the collapse of the ANZUS treaty with America. The reason is that NZ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wanted idealistic foreign policy and Labour wanted to be in govt,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than Labour being altruistic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you'd find that if NZ was a world-striding collossus like the US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the NZ govt would be highly imperialistic, the same as the govt of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all major world Powers are, sort of goes with the turf. NZ can afford to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be idealistic as the biggest threat to NZ is an invasion from Samoa.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If NZ were stuck in the middle of Africa or Asia then I suspect things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a wee tad different.
</em><br>
<p>A very good point. NZ can afford a principled isolationist stance
<br>
specifically for the same reasons the US could afford the same prior to
<br>
WWII: you can't git theyuh frum heyah.... that easily.
