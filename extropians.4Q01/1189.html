<p><em>&gt;You certainly aren't managing to keep your rational balance

</em><br>
<p>The above seems like an argumentum ad hominem tirade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Your idea of personal agreements regards property transactions is

</em><br>
<p>Straw man. I've never said there shouldn't be a &quot;wider code of
<br>
behaviour.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I don't believe in &quot;Natural Law&quot; in any divine sense, but a belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there are &quot;Laws&quot; is pretty undeniable ... every country

</em><br>
<p>Straw man. Distortion. Can't you tell the difference between the
<br>
rules by which games are played and the pretended &quot;laws&quot; of
<br>
political liars and cheaters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Animal society have social norms, enforced by violence or

<p>Straw man. Irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I would hope that posthuman 'codes/ laws' are a big modification
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;to replace Law with Lawlessness, which seems to be your aim.
</em><br>
<p>Straw man. I've never expressed above. I invite you to question
<br>
the notion of &quot;law&quot; (so-called) in your head. See &quot;Clear-Your-Mind
<br>
Reports&quot; &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm</a>&gt;.

<p><em>&gt;Oh yeh, and this e-group is subject to Yahoo! terms of service
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(rules). Surely I am entitled, like them, to ask adherence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my company's requests, for e-groups that choose to avail themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of belonging to this 'club.' If you break club rules/ laws the Yahoo!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could (directly &amp; legally) kick you out of the club? You accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rules as a pre-condition of joining ... so what is wrong with Laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of this type?
</em><br>
<p>Fraudulent argument. I agreed to Yahoo! RULES. Period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Sure there is a problem with (human) POLITICIANS, but this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a separate issue entirely from the Legislative process. They would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably be grasping ego-maniacs even in our monkey-troupe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society .....
</em><br>
<p>I invite you to consider that there might be a much deeper problem
<br>
from which practically all humans suffer, namely certain deep
<br>
concepts/notions such as &quot;law&quot; which underpin human politics.
<br>
See &quot;Clear-Your-Mind Reports&quot;
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm">http://www.buildfreedom.com/dir_clear.htm</a>&gt;.
<br>
Until you clear these primitive concepts/notions from your mind
<br>
you most likely will remain incapable of Posthuman Politics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  My advice .. read King Asoka. www.multisell.com/philosophy.htm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and learn about Bentham , JS Mills and others regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when it is OK to break an unjust Law. I want better Laws and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better process, not the removal of Law with no viable replacement.
</em><br>
<p>Straw man. I've never suggested the &quot;removal of Law.&quot; I have
<br>
suggested that you remove the silly notion of &quot;law&quot; (so-called)
<br>
from your head.
<br>
<p>My advice to you is to learn about Bentham, starting with 'Bentham's
<br>
Theory of Fictions' by C.K. Ogden, from which I quote:
<br>
<p>* &quot;Out of one foolish word may start a thousand daggers.&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;Behold here one of the artifices of lawyers. They refuse to administer
<br>
justice to you unless you join with them in their fictions; and then their
<br>
cry is, see how necessary fiction is to justice! Necessary indeed; but
<br>
too necessary; but how came it so, and who made it so?
<br>
<p>As well might the father of a family make it a rule never to let his children
<br>
have their breakfast till they had uttered, each of them, a certain number
<br>
of lies, curses, and profane oaths; and then exclaim, &quot;You see, my dear
<br>
children, how necessary, lying, cursing, and swearing are to human
<br>
sustenance!&quot;
<br>
<p>* &quot;Look to the letter, you find nonsense -- look beyond the letter,
<br>
you find nothing.&quot;
<br>
<p>Frederick Mann
