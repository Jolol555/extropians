<em>&gt; I think probably everyone would agree that we want a colorblind

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few days ago, Damien made a comment about the hippies'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to decree away jealousy, free love for all, etc.  But that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not make it go away.  Today no one even pretends we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how, as a society, to do away with jealously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You don't do it &quot;as a society&quot;.  You do it person by person with
<br>
hopefully societal support or at least sufficient saturation
<br>
eventually occurring.  But it still happens one person at a
<br>
time.  Luckily, there is parallelism. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We find in ourselves many examples of socialization that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no longer useful, yet many of us find it difficult or impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to simply turn them off.  We seem to have been hard wired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Difficult.  Not impossible.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We want a world of peace.  Wanting it doesn't get us there.
</em><br>
<p>Will you practice peace in everything you do?  It starts there
<br>
if you really want this and ifit starts at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Last night I had the strangest dream Id ever dreamed before,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I dreamed the world had all agreed to put an end to war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I dreamed I saw a mighty room, the room was filled with men,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the paper they were signing said they'd never fight again.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But we did fight again.  Good chance we will fight again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Decide and live by your decision.  There is no other way.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We want a world free of racism.  But how do we get to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective of species-wide unity?  Just by thinking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanity, uploading  AI and the singularity? 
</em><br>
<p>Good question.  No I don't think that is all you need.  It would
<br>
help to think and act in terms of all of humanity for a change
<br>
or at least come up with why you think that won't work and what
<br>
if anything can be done to change it. Most of the time the
<br>
default assumption seems to be that of scarcity.  With that
<br>
assumption thinking in terms of all of humanity is a losing
<br>
proposition because we don't believe there is enough to do
<br>
reasonably well by everyone.  To the extent that is true (and I
<br>
don't believe it is very true even now), better technology
<br>
(especially licking energy and production/distribution problems)
<br>
is an enabler.  But if the attitude doesn't shift and most
<br>
importantly, if why we are developing the technology doesn't
<br>
include upfront committment to the good of all of humanity
<br>
(instead of simply maximizing profits) then better technology
<br>
alone will not do the job.  Attitudes, goals and committment to
<br>
those goals are crucial to these kinds of change.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Is that really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all we need?  Are there any wetware changes, physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modifications we need to do?  Are we not hardwired to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compete?  To fight? 
</em><br>
<p>Not so much that it can't be overcome even without rewiring
<br>
ourselves physically imho.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To favor those who are more genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to ourselves?  To be jealous of others' amorous attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to our mates?  Can we really decree all this away, just be wanting to?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We are not automatons to such a deep degree that we cannot
<br>
choose how to act to at least some extent.  If we were we would
<br>
not be at this very different sort of life than what most of our
<br>
evolution geared us for. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I hope so.  But I may be a bit less optimistic that you are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer.  Thought provoking post, tho, thanks!  {8-]  spike
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  
<br>
<p>Optimism, in the sense of determination to find a way to what is
<br>
more optimal for our survival and thriving, might be required
<br>
for us to even put much effort into these things.
