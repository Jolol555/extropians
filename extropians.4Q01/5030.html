I am an American, not an Earthian. I will embrace my fellow specie as one, 
<br>
when I have reason to believe that they will do the same. For example, there 
<br>
is nobody on or off this list that could've disuaded Islamic Fundamentalists 
<br>
(Wahabbis) from propagandizing their fellow Muslims, not to massacre 
<br>
Americans. To believe otherwise is to embrace a kind of narcissism. 
<br>
<p>Economics is practiced by some nations as warfare. Cooperation is much better 
<br>
for the long-term, but this is not axiomatic that such nationialistic 
<br>
attempts will always faily in the short term. A prime example is OPEC, which 
<br>
is largely prommulgated by Wahabbi political goals as well as economic. There 
<br>
have been the Japanese economy of the 1980's which prided itself on unfair 
<br>
labor practices. The chickens came home to roost in their case, but we shan't 
<br>
always be so lucky.
<br>
<p>I am not an Earthian, and though I prefer cooperation, I realize that all may 
<br>
never feel this way. I am opposed to giving away the store, without anything 
<br>
in return, because I believe mutuality and reciprocation are what guarnatees 
<br>
cooperation, not noble words.
