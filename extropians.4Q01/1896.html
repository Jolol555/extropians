<em>&gt; &gt; Why is protection of publishing industries more important to American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; politicians than ammendments I, IV, V, and X?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does the 1st Amendment apply? Your right of free expression does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean you have the right to express other people's expressions without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their consent.
</em><br>
<p>It also prohibits derivative works: I cannot produce a translation,
<br>
adaptation, or a work in another medium based on a copyrighted work
<br>
(such as, say, a book comparing short stories by different authors,
<br>
or a rap song sampling differing tunes).  I can't use a song as the
<br>
soundtrack to a movie, or make a remix, or many other creative things.
<br>
And this is true even if the artist is long dead and cannot possibly
<br>
benefit from copyright protection, because most copyrights are owned
<br>
by publishing companies.  Just ask anyone who has tried to make
<br>
undergound cartoons with Disnet characters.  Copyright stifles
<br>
expression as much, if not more, than it encourages it.  Likewise
<br>
patents prevent me from making a minor improvement to an existing
<br>
invention, or combining inventions in useful ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 4th? Considering an artist who never makes any money because his art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is stolen by millions of ungrateful fans starves to death, I propose...
</em><br>
<p>That one's been batted out of the park so many times I won't even
<br>
bother with it, except to say that I'm surprized how many otherwise
<br>
libertarians, who would otherwise never assume that a law actually
<br>
accomplishes what the politicians who passed it says it will, are so
<br>
willing to assume that copyrights and patents actually accomplish
<br>
what they claim, or even that the real reasons for their passage
<br>
are the same as the claimed reasons.  And what do you say, Mr. Lorrey,
<br>
to the former admins of anon.penet.fi, who used to run a popular
<br>
anonymization service that was shut down by the feds at the request
<br>
of the Church of Scientology over copyright issues?  Was that a
<br>
reasonable seizure of criminal taking money from the pockets of
<br>
artists?  What do you say to Dmitri Sklyarov, now in jail under the
<br>
DMCA for publishing security information about a piece of software?
<br>
Was that seizure reasonable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 5th? dont' see it
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I see his point there either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 10th? that is states rights.
</em><br>
<p>...and the unenumerated rights of the people.  Such as the basic
<br>
human right to use the information in your head to improve your
<br>
life, without having to know where every little piece of it came
<br>
from or which uses are legal and which aren't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One could say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual property rights, because they exist within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitution, are the 0th Amendment rights.
</em><br>
<p>That section of the constitution enumerates the rights of congress,
<br>
one of which is the right to make laws estabishing intellectual
<br>
property rights.  It does not require them to do so, it only allows
<br>
them to (and they have chosesn to pass such laws).  The Bil of Rights
<br>
enumerates those things that congress _cannot_ legislate away from
<br>
the people, because they are basic human rights.  When sections of
<br>
the constitution conflict, the courts and congress are expected to
<br>
compromise.  It is not at all unreasonable to suggest that present
<br>
copyright law should be re-evaluated in the light of its effect
<br>
on free speech and other rights.
