Why bring the metal and volatiles from a near-earth asteroid to earth?
<br>
They would be quite useful in building something interesting in space
<br>
without having to haul so much up the gravity well.  A favorite fantasy
<br>
of mine is to have robots (smart and/or teleoperated) extract and
<br>
separate useful materials from such an asteroid for use in subsequent
<br>
manned or remote operations.  If the asteroid is hollowd out in the
<br>
process then it could perhaps become a rough base  for human
<br>
occupation.  The precious metals and such not directly useful could be a
<br>
source of trading income with Earth.
