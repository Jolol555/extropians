<em>&gt;&gt; Some thoughts on the subject of terrorism, for what it's worth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think it is very important to understand why we were attacked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Understanding why someone attacked you may help you avoid a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; similar situation in the future, for one thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;the rest of a long post distilled down to one sentence&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Give the terrorists what they want and they won't be terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anymore.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, yeah, I'm not really worried about what the terrorists themselves 
<br>
want.  They went over the line and should just be killed.  However, I'm 
<br>
worried about the half a billion other Middle Easterners who haven't 
<br>
done anything to us directly, but sympathize with the cause of the 
<br>
terrorists.  Some of them might sympathize enough to take up the 
<br>
terrorists' banner after we wipe out the current crop.  How many 
<br>
billions of dollars and thousands of lives will that cost us?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The first thing they want is for us/U.S to stop supporting Israel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so they can try/fail again to destroy it, and that is not going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen.
</em><br>
<p>As an American friend of mine whose parents came here from Palestine 
<br>
said to me recently, &quot;Yes, Palestinians at one point were only 
<br>
interested in the destruction of Israel, but they lost that battle.  
<br>
After fifty years of eating shit, though, they'd just settle for having 
<br>
control over most of the original Palestine that they were apportioned.&quot;
<br>
<p>Instead, Israel refuses to give up more than a token amount of the land 
<br>
that they took.  They're importing &quot;Jewish&quot; citizens by the thousands, 
<br>
and setting them up on Palestinian land.  Looks like a recipe for 
<br>
eternal turf battles to me.
<br>
<p>Also, this is more than just about Israel.  This is also about continued 
<br>
US support for puppet regimes like in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
<br>
<p>Sure, the US talks a good game about democracy and freedom, but Middle 
<br>
Easterners who would wish to have freedom and democracy in their own 
<br>
countries have to not only battle their own governments, but also the 
<br>
dollars and military of the United States.
<br>
<p>The Cold War is over.  This support of the &quot;lesser of evils&quot; no longer 
<br>
makes the sense that it did a couple of decades ago.
<br>
<p>I'd rather see us withdraw from the Middle East completely than continue 
<br>
to be embarrassed about our policies there.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What the terrorists are going to get is dead.
</em><br>
<p>I certainly hope so.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Chris Russo
