<p><em>&gt; This is an utterly off-the-wall question.  Nothing in the very

<em>&gt; legitimate points I raised justifies any raising of &quot;cultural
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; response.  I would prefer that the country I live in have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm just trying to cut to the chase, and I'll never get there unless I
<br>
read between the lines and then make the implicit explicit. As I see
<br>
it, there are people who always only say nice things about the USA.
<br>
The are brainwashed and I will not discuss them any further here. What
<br>
I'm interested in is what separates the reaining two groups-- those
<br>
who sometimes support and sometimes criticize the USA and those who
<br>
only criticize it. So, if I was asked this question, I would answer &quot;I
<br>
would prefer to live in a secular country, and I wish the government
<br>
of the country I now inhabit was even more secular than it is.&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't blame you for refusing to answer this question, though,
<br>
because it may force you into a painful contradiction. To answer as I
<br>
did, you'd be admitting that the so-called American Way of Life is
<br>
better for you than, say, the Afghanistani Way of Life or even the
<br>
Saudi Way of Life. On the other hand, you can't say that you'd rather
<br>
live under an Islamic theocracy, because their values are the
<br>
diametrical opposite of your own Western, post|modern, Liberal
<br>
values. On a practical level, you would also find yourself deprived of
<br>
the many freedoms you as a Westerner take for granted or even seek to
<br>
curtail.
<br>
<p>The reason I asked the question is basically to establish some
<br>
framework for understanding where you are coming from, and which of
<br>
your core values takes priority when it gets down to brass tacks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would prefer not to be exploited at all.  And I would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that world powers keep their hands off of my own country in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case.  I would especially prefer they not undermine its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government (if legitimately elected at least) and not bomb its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; territory any time they believe it might be in their interest to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so without due process.
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't we all. We'll never be sure that the US government has
<br>
stopped its exploitation because 1) it's more than happy to lie in
<br>
order to win our support and 2) its enemies are more than happy to lie
<br>
in order to deprive it of our support. As long as governments exist
<br>
power will be distributed neither in accordance with egalitarian
<br>
principles nor with meritocratic ones, so all we get to choose is who
<br>
exploits us. So, where on the selfish imperialists vs. oppressed but
<br>
itching to become the oppressor scale would your ideal place to live
<br>
be?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why is it that it's okay to criticize the excesses of Christianity, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those of Islam? Religion is religion is a crutch for the weak at best a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; virulent meme disease at worst.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is always ok to criticize.  It is not OK to conflate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions of some extremist elements with the entire religion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of its practictioners.  The latter is prejudice and sloppy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and very dangerous) thinking.
</em><br>
<p>I just don't remember ever seeing you taking pains to defend the good
<br>
name of moderate Christians when someone flames the Christian fundies.
<br>
Given that until recently anti-Christian flames were far more
<br>
frequent, this disparity is puzzling. I could be wrong, though, and if
<br>
so I apologize.
