I take the below report with a large lump of halite. Trust the _Telegraph_? Mmmmmmaybe. My bogometer hasn't pegged yet,
<br>
but it's definitely in the red. This, in particular, doesn't pass my smell test: &quot;history should be a witness that we
<br>
are terrorists. Yes, we kill their innocents&quot;
<br>
<p>Bad translation? Utter tabloid fabrication to get a nice grabber lede? Hmm. The whole &quot;innocent but not civilian&quot; thing
<br>
is mired in tough culture and semantics matters. I have to admit I have no idea what the Koran prohibition against
<br>
collateral damage actually says, let alone _means_; I am neither a reader of Arabic nor a mullah. Then again, the West
<br>
is certainly no stranger to killing for peace.
<br>
<p>Any Siggraph groupie has known about faking videos since _'way_ before Hollywood and Michael Crichton pumped out _Rising
<br>
Sun_. It is not out of the question that this is clever clandestine disinformation-agitprop by someone with some
<br>
render-farm time and a decent voice actor. Injection/initial distribution of such is the trickiest part.
<br>
<p>That said, people who rise to this call, whatever its true source, make themselves &quot;tall poppies&quot;, as the Ozzies say.
<br>
And if they want me dead, well, that clarifies my position toward them, I guess.
<br>
<p>It is also important to be mindful that terrorism is a _technique_. It is not an ideology. It is not a country. It is a
<br>
_modality_. So Obi-L might have said exactly what's been reported.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>Sorry if this is formatted poorly; I'm trying to strip out the HTML as best I can.

&nbsp;Looks like Binnie's taking credit for the WTC attack, after all. x-x-x-x Bin Laden: Yes, I did it
<br>
By David Bamber

(Filed: 11/11/2001) <a href="http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/11/11/wbin11.xml">http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/11/11/wbin11.xml</a>
<br>
&nbsp;OSAMA BIN LADEN has for the first time admitted that his al-Qa'eda group carried out the attacks on the World Trade
<br>
Centre and the Pentagon, the Telegraph can reveal.
<br>
In a previously undisclosed video which has been circulating for 14 days among his supporters, he confesses that
<br>
&quot;history should be a witness that we are terrorists. Yes, we kill their innocents&quot;.
<br>
<p>In the footage, shot in the Afghan mountains at the end of October, a smiling bin Laden goes on to say that the World
<br>
Trade Centre's twin towers were a &quot;legitimate target&quot; and the pilots who hijacked the planes were &quot;blessed by Allah&quot;.
<br>
<p>The killing of at least 4,537 people was justified, he claims, because they were &quot;not civilians&quot; but were working for
<br>
the American system.
<br>
<p>Bin Laden also makes a direct personal threat against Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, for the first time, and warns
<br>
nations such as Australia, Germany and Japan to stay out of the conflict.
<br>
<p>The video will form the centrepiece of Britain and America's new evidence against bin Laden, to be released this
<br>
Wednesday.
<br>
<p>The footage, to which the Telegraph obtained access in the Middle East yesterday, was not made for public release via
<br>
the al-Jazeera television network used by bin Laden for propaganda purposes in the past. It is believed to be intended
<br>
as a rallying call to al-Qa'eda members.
<br>
<p>In the video, bin Laden says: &quot;The Twin Towers were legitimate targets, they were supporting US economic power. These
<br>
events were great by all measurement. What was destroyed were not only the towers, but the towers of morale in that
<br>
country.&quot;
<br>
<p>The hijackers were &quot;blessed by Allah to destroy America's economic and military landmarks&quot;. He freely admits to being
<br>
behind the attacks: &quot;If avenging the killing of our people is terrorism then history should be a witness that we are
<br>
terrorists. Yes, we kill their innocents and this is legal religiously and logically.&quot;
<br>
<p>In a contradictory section, however, bin Laden justifies killing the occupants of the Twin Towers because they were not
<br>
civilians - Islam forbids the killing of innocent civilians even in a holy war.
<br>
<p>He says: &quot;The towers were supposed to be filled with supporters of the economical powers of the United States who are
<br>
abusing the world. Those who talk about civilians should change their stand and reconsider their position. We are
<br>
treating them like they treated us.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bin Laden goes on to justify his entire terror campaign. &quot;There are two types of terror, good and bad. What we are
<br>
practising is good terror. We will not stop killing them and whoever supports them.&quot;
<br>
<p>He directly threatens the lives of President Bush and Mr Blair. &quot;Bush and Blair don't understand anything but the power
<br>
of force. Every time they kill us, we kill them, so the balance of terror can be achieved.&quot; He also calls on all Muslims
<br>
to join him. &quot;It is the duty of every Muslim to fight. Killing Jews is top priority.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bin Laden warns other nations to keep out of the conflict, implying that they could face terror attacks if they do not.
<br>
<p>In the video, he also claims responsibility for an unspecified terrorist outrage in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which he
<br>
claims was sparked by secret messages in one of his videos.
<br>
<p>He admits for the first time using public pronouncements on video to whip up terrorism - a danger about which the
<br>
British and American governments have warned broadcasters.
<br>
<p>It is significant that throughout the video he uses the personal pronouns &quot;I&quot; and &quot;we&quot; to claim responsibility for the
<br>
attacks. In the past, he has spoken of the attackers only in the third person.
<br>
<p>Bin Laden has publicly issued four previous videos since September 11, always denying carrying out the atrocities.
<br>
<p>He now claims to have access to nuclear and chemical weapons. Bin Laden made the claims on Friday night during an
<br>
interview with the English language Pakistani newspaper Dawn.
<br>
He said: &quot;If America used chemical or nuclear weapons against us, then we may retort with chemical and nuclear weapons.
<br>
We have the weapons as deterrent.&quot;
<br>
<p>Defence analysts dismissed these claims. They said that although bin Laden could have access to nuclear material through
<br>
links with Pakistan or former Soviet republics, he was unlikely to have the technology to cause an explosion.
<br>
<p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: &quot;We know that he was looking for that capability. We believe he does not have
<br>
it.&quot;Emergency powers to imprison suspected international terrorists indefinitely using special closed courts will be
<br>
announced this week. The measure, which will require exemption from human rights legislation, will be used to round up
<br>
about 20 suspects hiding in Britain beyond the reach of existing laws.
