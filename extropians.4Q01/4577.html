<p><em>     &gt;We have directly disrupted and destroyed the duly elected
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;government of various nations
</em><br>
<p>It's happened a few times, Chile and Iran come to mind. War is a dirty business
<br>
so there are probably even examples somewhere in the history of the 40 year
<br>
cold war where America deposed elected leaders and should also feel ashamed
<br>
of itself because of it, but I can't think of an example off the top of my head.
<br>
I'm sure there must be a few instances where the world would have been better off
<br>
if America had not done it, but not many. Democracy does not guarantee virtue or
<br>
even sanity to those who get the most votes.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Every country does not do this
</em><br>
<p>Wrong. Every country tries to influence other countries to do things they like,
<br>
the most extreme example is war, covert action is tried if you want to fix
<br>
things in a less drastic way.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;and even if they did, it would still be clearly wrong
</em><br>
<p>When discussing world events you talk a lot about morality, indeed you
<br>
talk about little else, but to me morality is just a tool, a tool to reduce the
<br>
amount of misery in the world. If at the end of the day your ethical
<br>
gymnastics lead you to conclude that Bin Laden should be allowed to
<br>
hatch more terrorist plots in Afghanistan or Saddam Hussein allowed to
<br>
invade his neighbors rule the world economy and brew his bio weapons
<br>
then I have absolutely no use for your morality because being &quot;moral&quot; will
<br>
cause more pain torture and death than being &quot;immoral&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt;Saddam Hussein's Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt;the world, today he would also own of the first and third largest too
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt;and thus control the world economy if he hadn't been defeated militarily
</em><br>
<p><em>  &gt;Tough.
</em><br>
<p>Tough? You're confronted with the prospect of a creature like Saddam Hussein
<br>
ruling the world's economy and all you can say is &quot;Tough&quot;? If that's moral then
<br>
I'm immoral, and proud of it.
<br>
<p><em>      &gt;Do you believe in free enterprise or not?
</em><br>
<p>It's original I'll give you that, you bring up a line of argument that I confess had
<br>
not occurred to me, it just never crossed my mind to think of Saddam's tanks
<br>
pouring over the border as an example of free enterprise.
<br>
<p>But I'm really not surpassed you opposed Desert Storm, even though it was
<br>
sanctioned by the UN. You said you didn't like the war in Afghanistan because
<br>
it wasn't done through international efforts like the UN but I had a hunch that
<br>
wasn't the real reason. It's safe to advocate retaliation  if you figure there is
<br>
zero chance of the UN actually doing such a thing. I don't think you'd ever
<br>
advise taking military action, or action of any sort for that matter, against a
<br>
dictator regardless of how evil his deeds were, except perhaps if the USA
<br>
didn't want any action taken.
<br>
<p>You then go on to say that the USA wanted Iraq to invade Kuwait and to point
<br>
out that America had done bad things itself from time to time so if Iraq was the
<br>
only superpower on Earth and Saddam Hussein was running the show things
<br>
would not be any worse than they are now and might even be better. I thing there
<br>
could be a teeny tiny possibility that you just might be a little bit wrong about that.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; We also sold him  (indirectly through Canada) that nerve gas so he
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;could better  whoop up on the Iranians who we also wanted to keep in line.
</em><br>
<p>Yea, right, and I hear the Lost City of Atlantis was helping Saddam too.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I would want nukes or  something equally deterrent myself if I was the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;ruler of Iraq.  Wouldn't you?
</em><br>
<p>No, I can quite honestly tell you that I very definitely would not! I do find it
<br>
interesting however that you would desire weapons of mass destruction if
<br>
you were the ruler of Iraq, I guess our difference in this regard is due to
<br>
your superior morality.
