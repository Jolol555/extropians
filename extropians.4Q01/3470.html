<p>Hmmmmm... Jeff, I'm really not sure I understand your
<br>
position on these issues, do you think it might be possible
<br>
for you to state it a somewhat more clearly?   :-;
<br>
<p>On the lighter side... I got a telephone call today from
<br>
an individual at the office of &quot;Tom Davis&quot; (R) Washington
<br>
State [Not a representative of my district in Congress].
<br>
They invited me to listen to a message from Mr. Davis
<br>
inviting me to join the &quot;Washington Business Leader&quot;
<br>
roundtable (something that seemed to have the smell of
<br>
&quot;fundraising&quot;) in an effort to support efforts of representatives
<br>
to pass bills to accelerate depreciation, lower capital gains
<br>
tax rates, etc. (all the typical things businesses should support
<br>
and something the Republicans are pushing on in our &quot;economic&quot;
<br>
crisis that will have little or no effect in the short term and
<br>
perhaps even a negative effect in the long term).
<br>
<p>I calmly explained to them that I was the president of
<br>
a biotechnology company and that I viewed the position
<br>
of the House and the President on cloning as highly
<br>
unacceptable.  Not only was it bad for my business but
<br>
I viewed it as tremendously unacceptable to value a
<br>
cell or collection of cells over the possibility of
<br>
developing therapeutic treatments for living humans.
<br>
<p>The individual said they understood and ended the conversation.
<br>
I could almost hear the wheels turning on the other end of
<br>
the telephone line -- &quot;... perhaps this was *not* the correct
<br>
individual to call ...&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't know... Perhaps it would have been more fun
<br>
to go in as a mole, wait for the right time, then
<br>
denounce an appropriate speaker from the back of the room.
<br>
<p>Robert
