<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You misunderstand what &quot;created equal&quot; is supposed to mean. You

interpret the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; statement in strictly biological terms, and then it of course becomes
</em><br>
wrong.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But the writers of the above document did most certainly *not* think
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; polymorphisms or skin color, they were basing this on *ethical*
</em><br>
equality.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'll offer a voice as an individual with an &quot;American&quot; education (vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps a European education).  When we are educated in America and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; U.S. History is the subject -- in 8th grade if I recall so one is ~14
</em><br>
yrs
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; old -- &quot;ethics&quot; is not part of the discussion.  Ethics comes up perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when one takes philosophy classes in High School or College.  I cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recall a situation in my education when the Declaration of Independence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was discussed from an &quot;ethical&quot; perspective.  So while I may agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anders comments, I strongly question whether the average American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perceives them as Anders does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, you are likely right about this. And of course, the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; European would have roughly the same lack of understanding - I doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is any country where the ethical aspects of one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitution is a subject discussed in school below university level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which IMHO is a big problem - if you want democracy, then you better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain to children why democracy isn't just an arbitrary choice but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also the right choice (and quite practical too).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
In _Government and the Mind_ Joseph Tussman argues that there are in fact
<br>
four branches of government: the executive, the legislative, the judiciary
<br>
and the &quot;teaching power&quot; and that democracy's (especially the U.S) have lost
<br>
sight of this fourth branch and what it means. Well worth the read. Here's a
<br>
taste:

(One of my teachers studied with him, I guess that makes me his
<br>
grandstudent).
