<em>&gt;From: Anders Sandberg &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20If%20we%20do%20get%20Afghanistan,%20what%20shall%20we%20do%20with%20it?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200111192022.MAA04944@well.com&gt;">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt;As for Afghanistan, it is going to be a tricky case. But the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of dealing with it that has the most likeliehood of actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;succeeding and not resulting in more undesirable side-effects like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another bin laden is not to attempt to turn it into New Jersey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rather, there are many remnants of liberal islam and civil society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to build on. When Kabul television re-started yesterday it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very symbolic that it was a teenage girl who was presenter - it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was both a symbol of the new order, and a reminder of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation before the chaos (she had apparently been a presenter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;childrens programs before the taliban threw out television). There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are many similar strands that can be picked up, repaired and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;re-used to build Afghan society with outside help. That help will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;necessarily be biased and have an agenda, but it doesn't have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be coercive or seek to remake society into something it isn't and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have never been. What is needed is the conditions enabling a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bottom-up change of society rather than the top-down change. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speed with which many people reverted after the taliban shows that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;top-down changes are only skin deep. 
</em><br>
<p>Very good points.
<br>
<p>What Afghanistan needs right now is not another military force, it
<br>
needs a police force and a judicial system, at least until it can
<br>
reestablish it's own.
<br>
<p>Afghanistan needs order, and some emergency relief.
<br>
<p>The U.N. is very good at things like emergency relief and basic
<br>
education programs, exactly what Afghanistan needs right now.
<br>
<p>With an international force in place to quell rivalries for awhile.
<br>
things can get a chance to gell.
<br>
<p>The U.S. can remove it's unwanted self from the scene but still
<br>
maintain influence via dollars.
