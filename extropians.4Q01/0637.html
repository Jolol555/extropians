<em>&gt; Okay, so maybe it is about Islam. Perhaps it's time for our cherished cultural

</em><br>
<p>At the least, we better hope it is NOT about Islam. If it is
<br>
then and if it is public spoken of and fault on that basis then
<br>
we have opened the gates of hell.

<em>&gt; Samantha, if you could choose, and other things being equal, would you prefer
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer that the country you reside in currently be more or less secular?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is an utterly off-the-wall question.  Nothing in the very
<br>
legitimate points I raised justifies any raising of &quot;cultural
<br>
relativism&quot; at all.  I am amazed that such would be raised in
<br>
response.  I would prefer that the country I live in have a
<br>
greater
<br>
percentage of people who can actually think and are willing to
<br>
look
<br>
at sides of an issue objectively without knee-jerk positioning.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If you suddenly found yourself living in one of the Shariya countries, would
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; world power or your local theocracy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I would prefer not to be exploited at all.  And I would prefer
<br>
that world powers keep their hands off of my own country in any
<br>
case.  I would especially prefer they not undermine its
<br>
government (if legitimately elected at least) and not bomb its
<br>
territory any time they believe it might be in their interest to
<br>
do so without due process.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Why is it that it's okay to criticize the excesses of Christianity, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those of Islam? Religion is religion is a crutch for the weak at best a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virulent meme disease at worst.
</em><br>
<p>It is always ok to criticize.  It is not OK to conflate the
<br>
actions of some extremist elements with the entire religion and
<br>
all of its practictioners.  The latter is prejudice and sloppy
<br>
(and very dangerous) thinking.
