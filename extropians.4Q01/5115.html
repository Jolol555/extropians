</em><br>
<p>Please note I've changed the subject line of Eliezer's original post to our
<br>
more recent discussion title.
<br>
<p>As for &quot;absolute colorblindedness&quot; - hmmm, I'm not really sure what that
<br>
means, and I'm doubly unsure what the consequences of a &quot;colorblind&quot; policy
<br>
may be.  It doesn't seem to point to the reality in our society and culture.
<br>
The preaching of colorblindedness may, however, be useful in absolving the
<br>
preacher from any responsibility to come up with solutions for the here and
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>Certainly &quot;nature knows no color line&quot; (also a title of a J.A. Rogers book
<br>
published decades ago), and that the whole business about there being
<br>
&quot;races&quot; is scientifically meaningless.  But that fact hasn't prevented the
<br>
practice of racism in our society.  Racism trickles down and all around us
<br>
in ways familiar to us and in many ways more subtle (an example of the
<br>
latter, with all facts being equal, that &quot;white&quot; women can practically
<br>
subsidize their college education by being &quot;egg donors,&quot; while the eggs of
<br>
black women are not much desired).
<br>
<p>I talked to a young [white] woman just the other day (there are millions of
<br>
stories like this in the Naked City), who told me her father had disowned
<br>
her for taking up with a &quot;Negro.&quot;  She was young, perplexed and in pain, and
<br>
it would have been somewhat cavalier of me to say something to her along the
<br>
lines of &quot;[R]aces are figments of the racist imagination.&quot;
<br>
<p>Colorblind?  I don't know.  I keep seeing this cartoon in my head of two
<br>
people at a party, talking and laughing and maybe even flirting, and then
<br>
one of them says to the other, &quot;Oh, you mean you're &quot;white&quot;? (or vice versa,
<br>
&quot;black&quot;?)  Ha, ha, ha, whyyyyyyyyyy ... I didn't even *NOTICE* ... ha, ha,
<br>
ha, I'm colorblind!&quot;  It's kind of like that, &quot;Funny, you don't look Jewish
<br>
...,&quot; remark which can justifiably be considered insulting.   Take it to
<br>
another level:  &quot;Funny, you don't look gay.&quot;  Or another: &quot;You mean you're
<br>
only five feet tall?  Whyyyyyyy, that's funny, I didn't even notice!  I'm
<br>
heightblind!&quot;
<br>
<p>The point is, there's nothing wrong with being black[skinned] or
<br>
white[skinned] or blue eyed or curly haired or a bit bow-legged.  These (and
<br>
many more) superficial genetic traits don't have to be ignored.
<br>
<p>Noticing that someone is white or black is okay.  We don't have to be or
<br>
need to be colorblind.  If the whole concept of &quot;races&quot; is specious (and I
<br>
believe it is), then we don't have to be colorblind, do we?  And, as well,
<br>
we don't have to ignore the real problems that exist in our country (and in
<br>
the world) because there are many other people who DO believe in some kind
<br>
of racial hierarchy, causing problems for all of us, bringing us all down.
<br>
<p>I strongly disagree with the concept that it make us &quot;racist&quot; by noticing
<br>
that &quot;racism&quot; exists.  That's not being colorblind ... just blind.
