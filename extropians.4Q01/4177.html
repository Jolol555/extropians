I'd been wondering about the possibilities of investing in renewable energy
<br>
sources now, too. Not doubting Mike, but I'd welcome more opinions on this
<br>
subject.
<br>
<p>Is it the right time to invest in renewable energy? Which type?
<br>
<p>Note that you can probably assume that readers of this list have some
<br>
interest in renewable energy from a social and/or technological viewpoint.
<br>
Can we please ignore the feel-good factor, and just talk $?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Emlyn

<p><em>&gt; On a different note, right now is the best time in 40 years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to invest in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; renewable energy generation. Since renewables are so capital intensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in up front costs (while operating costs are negligible), the cost of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; renewables generation is highly affected by interest rates. With
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest rates at an all time low, it is a great time to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invest in such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology: OTEC, solar, wind, hydropower, wave energy, etc
</em><br>
