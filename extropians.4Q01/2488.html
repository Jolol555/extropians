<em>&gt; This thread reminds me a bit of Anton's syndrome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have noticed how many Americans simply don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand and can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notice when their reality doesn't fit the reality of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world. 
</em><br>
<p>Their ***perception*** of reality doesn't fit that of
<br>
the rest of the world because the information which
<br>
gives rise to that perception isn't the same.  Also,
<br>
they are mostly only aware that the rest of the world
<br>
has some problem or disagreement with *America* but
<br>
lack exposure to the details, the *facts*, which
<br>
underlie that disagreement. 
<br>
<p>The whole world is flummoxed by the horseshit fed them
<br>
by media spinmeisters.  Each country and culture has
<br>
its own.  Remember how the Serbians seemed to be in
<br>
complete denial about the circumstances in Kosovo?  It
<br>
would be very easy to think that they were in denial,
<br>
but it's only denial if you have access to the truth
<br>
and then deny it.  While there is almost certainly a
<br>
large degree of personal responsability, in the form
<br>
of a willingness to believe, despite an intellectual
<br>
awareness of the universal prevalence of propaganda,
<br>
the larger part of the problem is the simple lack of
<br>
unspun truth.  I didn't personally read the Serbian
<br>
press, but I can guess with a pretty high degree of
<br>
confidence that it reported the Serbians as the good
<br>
guys and the Albanians as the bad guys. (And who am I
<br>
to say what the truth actually was, since *our* press
<br>
has, IMO, an equally abysmal record re spin-free
<br>
truthfulness.) Most people haven't the skills, the
<br>
time, or the inclination to go digging out the truth,
<br>
by, say, looking at all the different spin versions
<br>
and finding a way to reconcile the differences.
<br>
<p>I probably would have passed this by without comment
<br>
except that I heard that pattern of speech --in this
<br>
case writing, actually--which is part of the problem: 
<br>
one says *Americans* think such and such, and one says
<br>
*America* does such and such, but the brainwashed
<br>
Americans who have a good-faith misperception of
<br>
reality--the vast population of deeply decent
<br>
Americans--are not the power elite who do the doing--
<br>
inflict American foreign policy on the world beyond
<br>
American borders.  And while the power elite probably
<br>
largely internalizes--comes to believe--its own
<br>
propaganda, they have vastly more opportunity to see
<br>
the real truth, prior to fucking the world on behalf
<br>
of the moneyed interests and in pursuit of their own
<br>
little share of the spoils. 
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>Now look at the broad nouns and pronouns below, which,
<br>
due to lack of specificity, coarsely attribute
<br>
actions, attitudes, intentions, and beliefs to vast
<br>
numbers of people who, in reality, are simply
<br>
misinformed, and fail utterly to assign responsibility
<br>
to the genuinely responsible. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The perceived hypocricy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogance of 
</em><br>
<p>*the US* 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to this - while from an 
</em><br>
<p>*american*
<br>
<p><em>&gt; perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many actions make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense, they are widely perceived as hypocritical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such as supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many non-democratic governments) and arrogant (when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far-flung geopolitics). When 
</em><br>
<p>*the americans*
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; react with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomprehension that 
</em><br>
<p>*their*
<br>
<p><em>&gt; nice intentions are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horribly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misinterpreted, this in turn is interpreted as even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more arrogance -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>*they*
<br>
<p><em>&gt; don't even care to understand the views of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others!
</em><br>
<p>Don't get me wrong Anders.  This is not a criticism of
<br>
your personal use of language--take a look at my first
<br>
paragraph; I do the same thing-- but rather an
<br>
observation of an almost universal problem associated
<br>
with speaking about people in large groups, and in a
<br>
context of responsibility for actions which are, in
<br>
fact, executed by very distinct, separate,
<br>
(potentially)identifiable individuals.
<br>
<p>I want a world where those who act with power are
<br>
under a microscope, unable to hide in a crowd of
<br>
innocents, naked to the truth, and who will
<br>
automatically and inescapably be held responsible for
<br>
their actions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
