[Shelly Goldstein]
<br>
<p>Moreover, it would not be at all sensible for a theory to acknowledge that 
<br>
&quot;any statement about the world has to make reference to observation,'' 
<br>
since Zeilinger's assertion is plainly false. Statements about history are 
<br>
not statements about history books, and statements about dinosaurs are not 
<br>
statements about fossilized dinosaur bones.
<br>
<p>[Mitch]
<br>
<p>Without picking a fight with Anton Zeilinger, I would argue with Goldstein, 
<br>
that tangentially, statements about History, can certainly be viewed on 
<br>
whether or not someone's' History Book was indeed, accurate. Or as we say in 
<br>
Ohio, &quot;where'd you go to school, in Kentucky?&quot;  Statements about dinosaurs, 
<br>
surely, relate to statements about dinosaur fossils. Paleontologists handle 
<br>
little else but fossilized bones. Occasionally someone outside the field, 
<br>
like Alvarez, can turn the topic on its ear, by viewing phenomena outside the 
<br>
box, as he did by studying chemical traces of iridium. 
<br>
<p>[scerir]
<br>
<p>About Zeilingers's &quot;any statement about the world has to make reference 
<br>
to observation'' I think that Shelly Goldstein's opposite view might have
<br>
some unexpected support from Einstein (contrarian of contrarians).
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; The following year, 1926, is one of high drama in this growing but troubled 
<br>
relationship. In April, Heisenberg gave a two-hour lecture on his matrix 
<br>
mechanics in von Laue's famous physics colloquium at the University of Berlin. 
<br>
In the audience, with a whole group of potentates, was Einstein. It was their 
<br>
second meeting. Einstein, interested and no doubt disturbed by the lecture, 
<br>
asked Heisenberg to walk home with him (there is that walk again) and thus 
<br>
ensued a remarkable discussion, which Heisenberg first reported in print in 1969 (*).
<br>
<p>In the discussion with Einstein, Heisenberg once more tried to draw attention to 
<br>
his having dealt not with unobservable electron orbits inside atoms, but rather with 
<br>
observable radiation. He said to Einstein: &quot;Since it is acceptable to allow into a 
<br>
theory only directly observable magnitudes, I thought it more natural to restrict 
<br>
myself to these, bringing them in, as it were, as representatives of electron orbits.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Einstein responded, &quot;But you don't seriously believe that only observable 
<br>
magnitudes must go into a physical theory?&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Heisenberg goes on, &quot;In astonishment, I said, I thought that it was exactly 
<br>
you who had made this thought the foundation of your relativity theory. . . .&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Einstein replied, &quot;Perhaps I used this sort of philosophy; but it is nevertheless 
<br>
nonsense.&quot;. And then came Einstein's famous sentence: &quot;Only the theory 
<br>
decides what one can observe.&quot; &gt;&gt; (**)

<br>
<p>I like to believe (against all odds) that information is somehow physically 
<br>
stored in the universe, somehow. But I guess that is why pharmaceutical 
<br>
companies make prozac ;-)
<br>
<p>[scerir]
<br>
<p>I'm checking Stonier's book, to see where he stores his &quot;infons&quot; (and his
<br>
prozacs).
