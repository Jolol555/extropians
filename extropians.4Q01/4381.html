</em><br>
<p>I grieve with you, G.P. My father died last month. Over the past two years
<br>
cancer robbed him of his curiosity, strength and love of life. At the end,
<br>
he was an emaciated, helpless old man (though as long as he was conscious he
<br>
retained his intelligence sense of humor).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aging and death are not necessary, they are just a horrible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid, cruel and pointless waste.
</em><br>
<p>I couldn't agree more. DEATH SUCKS.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By mastering the sciences ad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies of life and information, we will take full control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our development and make aging and death ugly things of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past. In memory of Anna, I will do my best to help achieving this goal.
</em><br>
<p>And so will I. But I fear our society is riddled with insane beliefs that
<br>
will impede progress. I saw many examples of this during the months before
<br>
my father's death. About a year ago, I tentatively mentioned the possibility
<br>
of cryonics to my mother. She went off into a rant about how that would be
<br>
going against God's will. It was useless to try to point out to her that all
<br>
medical procedures have the aim of prolonging life (the will of the god she
<br>
worships is apparently for people to live short, meaningless lives).
<br>
<p>During the couple of months before my father died, while he was trying to
<br>
cope with the knowledge that he wasn't going to be around much longer, my
<br>
mother hounded him incessantly about &quot;accepting Jesus as his savior&quot; so he
<br>
could &quot;go to heaven.&quot;  My brother and I could be enjoying a good
<br>
conversation with him, but when he heard my mother coming he'd pretend to be
<br>
comatose. It's particularly ironic that a substantial portion of the money
<br>
he earned during his lifetime will be donated by my mother to churches and
<br>
other religious organizations which will use it in part to lobby for laws
<br>
prohibiting research that could make aging and death ugly things of the
<br>
past.
<br>
<p>Religious beliefs can't be countered with logic. People dissociate--they
<br>
switch off the logic when they discuss their religious beliefs. There has
<br>
been discussion from time to time about whether &quot;Extropianism&quot; is a sort of
<br>
religion. While one would certainly not want to encourage unthinking
<br>
adherence to extropian principles, the fellowship aspects of religion are
<br>
somewhat appealing. People seem to have a hard-wired need to belong to a
<br>
group, even people who have a hard time socializing  (there are, e.g.,
<br>
online Asperger communities).
