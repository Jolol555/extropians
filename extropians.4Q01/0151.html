<p>Furthermore, in vitro fertilization is hardly an unstressful
<br>
procedure.  Stress is known to shunt resources such as glucose
<br>
away from non-essential body systems (e.g. the reproductive
<br>
tract, the immune system, etc.) to make them available for the
<br>
fight-or-flight response (See books by Robert Sapolsky).  So
<br>
if prayer serves to alleviate stress by taking the success
<br>
of the procedure out of your hands (i.e. it will turn out
<br>
according to &quot;God's will&quot; and you have no &quot;real&quot; control over
<br>
the situation), then stress levels are likely to be lower
<br>
and more resources may be available to allow successful
<br>
attachment and growth of the embryo.
<br>
<p>No nitwit many-worlds explanation required -- simple applied
<br>
endocrinology and physiology.
<br>
<p>### But the prayed-for and their doctors reportedly didn't know somebody was
<br>
praying for them. How can that be explained by placebo?
<br>
<p>If this study is not fraudulent or statistically insignificant, it would
<br>
open up new vistas for science. Perhaps scientists could deal some blows to
<br>
organized religion (if it turned out that atheists like me could get the
<br>
same results as Christians) and find ways of contacting the other branches
<br>
of the multiverse, or maybe religion would become another branch of applied
<br>
science (if it turned out that the big daddy in the sky is real).
<br>
<p>Well, actually it feels to me more like fraud or silliness, after all. But I
<br>
will still be looking forward to more news on this subject.
