<em>&gt; writes about an aborted test flight of the XCOR Aerospace (Doug Jones'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company) rocket plane.  It's not clear from the article when the events
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened; it was to be the second test flight but there was a fire which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fortunately didn't damage the plane, and they say that the flight was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful a few days later, although I guess the reporter wasn't present.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The print edition had a photo but the online version doesn't seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have it.
</em><br>
<p>The aborted flight was Nov 1; there was no damage (except to our
<br>
nerves), we fixed the problems and flew again Nov 9 (flight 4, 2nd
<br>
up&amp;away flight).  The photographer was present but not the reporter. 
<br>
Our public rollout and flight today was a great success, and we should
<br>
be getting more favorable coverage soon from various avaiation
<br>
magazines.  KABC channel 7 got some excellent footage from the spectator
<br>
area, but we had our own cameras right at the runway and on top of the
<br>
airport tower- look for these on our website soon.
<br>
<p>We've been working incredibly hard and making great progress.  It's a
<br>
rough job, but somebody's gotta do it.
<br>
<p>There's also a nice picture in Time Magazine, although the article has a
<br>
shallow emphasis on Jeff (the reporter was not very attentive).

<br>
<p>It's a bit amusing that the next &quot;invention&quot; in the magazine is the
<br>
Groen Bros gyrocopter; they had the booth right next to ours at the
<br>
Oshkosh airshow in July.  Small world.
