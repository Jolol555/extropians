I'm in the middle of a paper on what the gradual evolution
<br>
of bioterrorism might look like (and scaring myself silly in the
<br>
process).  Unfortunately it isn't going to be a public paper.
<br>
<p>You know the &quot;crop duster&quot; idea?  It turns out that was developed
<br>
by our own theorists as a good way to attack Washington with
<br>
Anthrax spores and published in an Office of Technology Assessment
<br>
report in 1994.  [Stupid, stupid, stupid...]
<br>
<p>A good source is a collection of articles from the CDC:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no4/contents.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no4/contents.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Particularly the Tucker, Davis and Olson articles.
<br>
<p>Samantha, I'd like to particularly suggest that you read them.
<br>
<p>Lets assume the Iraqi's still have 1/10th of the 84,250 liters
<br>
of anthrax spores they were supposed to have produced.  Lets
<br>
assume that 100 kg (@ 1kg/l) can kill the low end of the 130,000
<br>
to 3 million people estimated in the OTA assement.  That quantity
<br>
of spores would kill more than 10 million people if they could
<br>
find a way to deliver it effectively.
<br>
<p>Hussein has already demonstrated a willingness to use such
<br>
weapons.  The only thing stopping him is the knowledge that
<br>
we wouldn't hesitate to erase him from the planet if he did.
<br>
<p><p>Heed these words:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Too many times in the past we have failed to anticipate future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developments; refused to think the unthinkable and expect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unexpected. Too many times we have been out maneuvered by those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take the time to think and plan and do not simply rely on reacting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to events. We must learn to think like our potential adversaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we are to avoid conflict or blunt an attack, because only superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking and planning (not just better technology) will enable us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive biological warfare.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Christopher J. Davis, Johns Hopkins, 1999(!)
