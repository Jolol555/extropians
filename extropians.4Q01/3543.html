<p><em>&gt;Well, yeah, I'm not really worried about what the terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves want.  They went over the line and should just be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;killed.  However, I'm worried about the half a billion other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Middle Easterners who haven't  done anything to us directly, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sympathize with the cause of the terrorists.  Some of them might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sympathize enough to take up the terrorists' banner after we wipe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out the current crop.  How many billions of dollars and thousands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of lives will that cost us?
</em><br>
<p>The world has changed and the rules have changed.
<br>
<p>The anger of much of the middle east has turned to confusion as
<br>
they see the Afghans are now better off now than they were before
<br>
we arrived. The Taliban who always strictly controlled the media
<br>
are gone and the actual citizens are telling their own network, Al-
<br>
Jazzera, their horror stories.
<br>
<p>The truth is winning the day.
<br>
<p>We should stick to a straight and nobel path. Finish the job in
<br>
Afghanistan then get out. Help with the talks in Bonn, and make it
<br>
clear that further U.S. aid is tied to certain concepts, like
<br>
universal rights.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;As an American friend of mine whose parents came here from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Palestine said to me recently, &quot;Yes, Palestinians at one point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were only interested in the destruction of Israel, but they lost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that battle. After fifty years of eating shit, though, they'd just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;settle for having control over most of the original Palestine that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were apportioned.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Instead, Israel refuses to give up more than a token amount of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;land that they took.  They're importing &quot;Jewish&quot; citizens by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thousands, and setting them up on Palestinian land.  Looks like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recipe for eternal turf battles to me.
</em><br>
<p><p>Your friends are in the minority.
<br>
<p>The Palestinians lost their land when they joined the rest of the
<br>
Arab world in attacking Israel the day after it was declared.
<br>
<p>They have continued to miss every opportunity to regain it ever
<br>
since. They have waged a war of terror which continues to this day
<br>
and is the single major stumbling block from reaching a settlement.
<br>
<p>Both Jordan and Syria occupy former Palestinian land and isn't it
<br>
funny that you never hear boo about it?
<br>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I'd like to see this set right, but the
<br>
Palestinians are every bit as much at fault, if not more so, than
<br>
the Israelis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, this is more than just about Israel.  This is also about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continued US support for puppet regimes like in Saudi Arabia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Kuwait.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure, the US talks a good game about democracy and freedom, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Middle Easterners who would wish to have freedom and democracy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their own countries have to not only battle their own governments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but also the dollars and military of the United States.
</em><br>
<p><p>So what right to we have to go around kicking in governments?
<br>
<p>Liberals always want to have things both ways.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The Cold War is over.  This support of the &quot;lesser of evils&quot; no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longer makes the sense that it did a couple of decades ago.
</em><br>
<p><p>Which is better, a corrupt government or a fundamentalist one?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I'd rather see us withdraw from the Middle East completely than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to be embarrassed about our policies there.
</em><br>
<p><p>There are places in the middle east where we are welcome, Kuwait
<br>
for example.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; What the terrorists are going to get is dead.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I certainly hope so.
</em><br>
<p>Bet your last dollar on it.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
