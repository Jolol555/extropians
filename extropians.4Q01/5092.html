</em><br>
<p>Yes, you are likely right about this. And of course, the average
<br>
European would have roughly the same lack of understanding - I doubt 
<br>
there is any country where the ethical aspects of one's
<br>
constitution is a subject discussed in school below university level.
<br>
Which IMHO is a big problem - if you want democracy, then you better
<br>
explain to children why democracy isn't just an arbitrary choice but
<br>
also the right choice (and quite practical too). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Don't take it wrong, but your engineering perspective makes you miss a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reference that is glaringly obvious to anyone involved in philosophy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; especially political philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders, Anders, Anders... the *average* person has virtually no education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in &quot;philosophy&quot; (at least here in America).
</em><br>
<p>And unlike the image that I have noticed occasionally in american
<br>
culture that we europans are all cultured, refined and have great
<br>
classical educations, the average european has absolutely no education
<br>
or interest in philosophy either. Or any refinement either :-)
<br>
<p>The engineering reference was related to the two-cultures thing: I think
<br>
we in the sciences tend to be less exposed to the humanist traditions
<br>
than we should be. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What they really talk about here is that every human has an equal inherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human dignity, the inherent value of being a human being living a life on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one's own terms and with one's own goal. From this axiom follows inalienable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rights such as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  There is an intuitive self-referential argument that one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want everyone to have equal opportunities because you would also like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have those opportunities oneself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the devil is in the details -- if one buys off on the concept that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone has &quot;equal dignity&quot;, then one should buy off on the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone should have equal starting conditions.  So, the human social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment should be exactly like &quot;horse racing&quot; -- where one handicaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the horses with greater inherent advantages to make the race an exercise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fairness (more ethical?) rather than one where one simply selects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those with the greatest gene set (natural selection).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that doesn't follow. If your and mine lives have equal worth,
<br>
it doesn't imply that (unless you include some extra assumptions) that
<br>
we should have equal starting conditions. 
<br>
<p>[ I just discovered that Swedish seems to have a distinction that
<br>
english doesn't have (quite rare): we have the words &quot;jämlik&quot; and &quot;lik&quot;.
<br>
Both would be translated as &quot;equal&quot;, but the first means &quot;equal in
<br>
value&quot;, the second &quot;equal&quot; as in identity or similarity. Two people can
<br>
be jämlik but not lik. (Of course, the same confusion of having equal
<br>
rights as implying having equality of opportunity or even outcome is
<br>
quite common here, and has been a powerful driving force in much of
<br>
Swedish politics the last sixty years). ]
<br>
<p>Equality of opportunity can be a positive or a negative right. As a
<br>
negative right it means that nobody should be hindered due to their
<br>
background from making an attempt, as a positive right you get something
<br>
more akin to the handicap approach: everybody should have equal starting
<br>
situations. As a negative right it actually helps promote both
<br>
individual uniqueness and works well with the idea of equal dignity. As
<br>
a positive right things can easily get anti-individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As for racism, devaluing somebody's dignity because of their genome or culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is clearly against this concept of humans as self-developing, self-directing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goals in themselves.  You can of course dislike a person or group of person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; depending on what they do or think, but that should never remove the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recognition of their basic human dignity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, but to what extent should each independent actor be obligated (coerced?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into compensating for the genetic or cultural disadvantages that specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals are dealt?
</em><br>
<p>In my opinion there is no obligation to compensate at all. But each
<br>
individual is of course allowed to be as compassionate and helpful as
<br>
they wish, and may of course cooperate to create more efficient
<br>
compensation and help systems. This is a consequence of my view that
<br>
there exists a kind of general ethics, which should be universal in a
<br>
society but is in general as minimalist as possible, that upholds rights
<br>
but only in the negative sense (such protection from coercion), but not
<br>
making any other ethical demands (a minimalist operating system). On top
<br>
of this everybody has their own private ethics (an application layer),
<br>
telling what is good and bad beside the universals: here compassion and
<br>
different views of how to help others come in. 
<br>
<p>This libertarian system is of course not used anywhere yet, but I think
<br>
it would be a workable compromise for many pluralist societies. You're
<br>
not allowed to coerce anybody to pay for compensation, but you are
<br>
welcome to participate in networks that agree on a voluntary level of
<br>
compensation. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Given my background and education (typical middle-class American) it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was completely &quot;reasonable&quot; that one should be taking from the rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and giving to the poor because that would result in everyone being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;equal&quot; (just like it said in the founding documents for our country).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [If you look back into the &quot;town meeting&quot; tradition of government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly in New England, there is a constant thread that everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should have an &quot;equal&quot; voice.  There is environmental pressure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone *should* be &quot;equal&quot;.]  
</em><br>
<p>Note how the semantic confusion here works to promote a coercive agenda;
<br>
the town meeting system likely is based on the equality of dignity idea,
<br>
but it gets turned into equality of opportunity which then gets turned
<br>
into equality of outcome. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; since a lot of the formulations in the Extropian Principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; similarly has to be understood in terms of a long humanist and liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tradition. If you do not place them in a larger philosophicl context they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not really make much sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then they aren't going to make much sense to *most* people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the U.S. Census Dept. the 20-24 age group (Y2000) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 18.6 million people (~3.7 m people at each age) and according to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dept. of Education (<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/proj01/tables/table27.asp">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/proj01/tables/table27.asp</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number of college graduates in Y2000 is ~1.2 million (~32%).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only Americans who understand &quot;humanist&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; traditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are probably those who have a college education and those who study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these areas (philosophy &amp; pol sci majors).  So you are now down to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than ~10%, more likely &lt; 5% of the population.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. This is unfortunately true. And if you try out the principles on
<br>
most people, you will find that they do not get them. Here in Europe the
<br>
situation is likely worse, because many (most?) of the college educated
<br>
people with the right majors have been steeped in a memetic environment
<br>
that is strongly on the equality of outcome side - they have a hard time
<br>
taking such bizarre statements as the extropian principles seriously! If
<br>
they weren't turned off by the technophilia and americanness of them
<br>
(yes, the fact that extropians are americans has been used in
<br>
transhumanism-critical articles as a kind of argument against the whole
<br>
idea! If americans believe it, it is wrong or stupid) then the liberal
<br>
ideas would actually feel rather alien. To 90% of all Swedish academics
<br>
equality of opportunity actually means equality of outcome. 
<br>
<p>But even if the principles make assumptions and references that are not
<br>
obvious, they are still good and can affect people. Ideas have enormous
<br>
power, and can be expressed and re-expressed in a myriad forms.
<br>
Gradually over time they can percolate through culture and change it.
<br>
But it helps if the bearers of the ideas are aware of where they come
<br>
from and what they link to.
