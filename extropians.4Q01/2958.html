<em>&gt; &gt; Sovereign _individuals_ are more important than sovereign states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A state that tramples the rights of its people has no right to exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In international relations, states predominate.  This might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunate (I think it is) but it is the focus of international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law and diplomacy today.  If you say that we are charged with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the job of protecting/securing individual rights globally or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least have every right to do so then this is tantamount to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declaration of nearly global war.  I don't think that is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intention so I am curious as to how and where you draw the line.
</em><br>
<p>We are not charged with protecting the rights of individuals
<br>
everywhere, but we /are/ charged with protecting the rights and
<br>
physical safety of Americans.  If doing that requires interfering
<br>
with a state that doesn't have any right to exist in the first place,
<br>
I can live with that.  If a state threatens our people, we have the
<br>
moral duty to defend our people against it.
<br>
<p>Yes, international relations occur between states, but their
<br>
/purpose/ is about protecting people.  If states have to die to
<br>
keep people alive, then that's what has to happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I brought up Russia to show that it is not pragmatic to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from such principles as you seem to espouse when it comes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other sovereign governments generally.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody ever said it was easy.  but it's a lot better to work from
<br>
principles than to work without them, as we seem to have done in
<br>
the past far too often.  It's also important that we not let
<br>
overreaction to our past of unjustified aggression stop us from
<br>
using justified aggression when we need to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I've never argued otherwise.  Indeed, I've prety consistently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; argued that the US government is a criminal organization, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our foreign policy is stupid and inconsistent.  But let's not go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from there to say that we must correct it by completely pulling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out of all foreign relations.  We correct it by enforcing policies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that are more sensible and consistent, and some of those policies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can and will call for intervention in foreign governments, so long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as we do it sparingly and for the right reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah.  Here we largely have some agreement.  I don't suggest we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pull out of all foreign relations by any means.  I do suggest we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start acting on the basis of our much touted principles with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regard to other nations instead of effectively assuming that any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and all means are justified by our hoped for ends, even when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means effectively deny and destroy the stated ends. 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, but respect for foreign states (or even my own state for
<br>
that matter) is /not/ one of my principles.  Respect for the lives
<br>
of human beings is.  Nothing in Somalia threatened American lives;
<br>
we should have kept our noses out of their business (except for
<br>
allowing private aid).  Nothing in Kosovo threatened American lives;
<br>
we shouldn't be there.  But the Taliban government of Afghanistan
<br>
threatens American lives by protecting perpetrators of evil against
<br>
us, and by indoctrinating its people in a culture of hatred toward
<br>
our values and our nation.  We cannot allow this to continue.
