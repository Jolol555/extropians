Subject: Big government for what
<br>
Date: Wed, 17 Oct 2001 16:50:10 -0700
<br>
<p>I have to admit there is a sick irony about the situation as it has
<br>
emerged.
<br>
<p>The United States was so concerned with it's war on drugs, so unconcerned
<br>
about immigration, writing so many laws limiting the right of the American
<br>
people (James Bovard, Lost Rights, I think he has a new book as well) and
<br>
both the government and industry ignored the advise of their own security
<br>
experts (their recommendations were too expensive) on terrorism it is a
<br>
supprise that there are only 6000 dead and not 60000 or 6 million.
<br>
<p><p><p>I think there is a lot of truth to what you say.  I have come to think that
<br>
in many ways the USA is run like a sheep ranch.  The rancher is not all that
<br>
concerned with his sheep.  He certainly will not grant them rights unless
<br>
forced.  It seems to me that there was a lot more, for lack of a better
<br>
phrase, &quot;power to the people&quot; about 25-35 years ago.  Maybe I am just
<br>
imagining it.  There certainly seemed to be more laws enacted that empowered
<br>
people, or that were truly to the benefit of teh &quot;masses.&quot;  I dunno....
<br>
<p><p>Returning to the analogy of the rancher, I cannot see that maximizing the
<br>
rancher's profit necessarily helps the sheep.
