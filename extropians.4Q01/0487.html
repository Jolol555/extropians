<em>&gt; Yes. The factory in Sudan was blown up late at night to minimize casualties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was blown up because it was believed to be manufacturing biological weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now it is possible they were wrong about that, perhaps the murderous power

<em>&gt; hungry thugs who run Sudan decided to build a  baby food factory instead,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps they decided to ring the baby food factory with barbed wire, security

</em><br>
<em>&gt; airliners into the World Trade Center is yet another example of poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mr.Chomsky's moral tone deafness handicap.
</em><br>
<p>There was no proof that the plant was manufacturing nerve gas
<br>
and so on beyond a precursor chemical commonly used in many
<br>
things including pesticides being found in the soil near the
<br>
plant.  This chemical is not listed on any recognized
<br>
international restrictions  on possible biological or gas weapon
<br>
production. The claim they were making never gas was largely
<br>
discredited.  The plant did manufacture 50% of the countries
<br>
basic pharmaceuticals. We blew hell out of part of their
<br>
pharmaceutical industry.  We blew up parts of Sudan and
<br>
Afghainstan supposedly in response to the East Africa bombings. 
<br>
We launched missles against the territory and facilities of
<br>
countries we were not at war with.  If such a thing was done
<br>
against US targets or over US soil we would rightly consider it
<br>
an act of war.  And yet we talk about how humane we were to do
<br>
it in the middle of the night?  By current international
<br>
conventions we had no right to do this at all.   We ultimately
<br>
did it because we could get away with it and perhaps because it
<br>
took some attentions of Clinton's doemstic woes and because it
<br>
was &quot;doing something&quot;.  
<br>
<p>In short we were major international bullies in this incident.
<br>
We blew up a civilian target in the middle of a country's
<br>
sovereign territory doing a great deal of harm to part of their
<br>
economy for largely domestic political reasons and perhaps to
<br>
give notice that we could &quot;reach out and touch someone&quot; whenever
<br>
we wish regardless of relevant international law and the
<br>
niceties of diplomacy.
<br>
<p>There were none of the bizarre contrivances listed above.  The
<br>
factory was thrown open to international examination. 
<br>
<p>An investigation was called for in the UN and was backed by the
<br>
22-nation Arab League.  It was blocked by the US and Britain.
