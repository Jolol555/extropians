<p>There is &quot;stimuation&quot; and then there is cancerous growth.  Our
<br>
economic growth has on the one hand created a lot of wealth in
<br>
the sense of real value, on the other hand it has wasted a lot
<br>
of lives and minds on the mere production and accumulation of
<br>
tokens signifying little but the production and accumulation of
<br>
tokens.  The tokens are not value in and of themselves and do
<br>
not help us in and of themselves.  It is all too easy to forget
<br>
this.  
<br>
<p>The laws have become in part tools to shuffle the tokens around
<br>
regardless of questions of both value and any real justice.  The
<br>
laws governing IP especially have done tremendous damage to
<br>
creativity and the production of truly greater wealth - wealth
<br>
of increasing value.
