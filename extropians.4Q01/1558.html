<p><p><em>&gt; This is the crux of the matter.  In my (admittedly superficial) study of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islam of late I was specifically looking for evidence that Muhammad
</em><br>
exhorted
<br>
<em>&gt; Muslims to spread their faith militarily.  I could find none.  If you
</em><br>
could
<br>
<em>&gt; refer me to what you have read which leads you to believe that Muhammad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocated military conversion of non-believers, I would greatly appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p><p>Zero, it seems there are three approaches to this question, the first of
<br>
which can be treated briefly, the second unfortunately requiring more time
<br>
than I have to devote to the subject at present and the third perhaps
<br>
addressable over a period of a few days.  The first approach is to simply
<br>
look at the text itself and the undisputed facts of Muhhamed's life and draw
<br>
one's own conclusions.  The second approach leads through the dense network
<br>
of the hadith and the even more dense jungle of hadith scholarship, a path
<br>
that none of us on the list is likely qualified to follow at this point and
<br>
about which I have doubts I could be qualified to opine even if I spent 20
<br>
years on the subject.  The third approach is to look at the actual
<br>
expression of the over-all cultural milieu influenced by the ulamma and
<br>
immamate as it exists now in the world, i.e. &quot;the state of the ummah&quot;, as it
<br>
were, and draw some conclusions about what Islam means based on how people
<br>
who call themselves Muslims actually behave.
<br>
<p>On the first path, I find the following surrah particularly instructive:
<br>
<p>9:3: &quot;And an announcement from Allah and His Apostle to the people on the
<br>
day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah and His Apostle are free from
<br>
liability to the idolaters; therefore if you repent, it will be better for
<br>
you, and if you turn back, then know that you will not weaken Allah; and
<br>
announce painful punishment to those who disbelieve.&quot;
<br>
9:5 &quot;So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters
<br>
wherever you find them, and take them captives and besiege them and lie in
<br>
wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and
<br>
pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them; surely Allah is Forgiving,
<br>
Merciful.&quot;
<br>
9:29 &quot;Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the latter day, nor do
<br>
they prohibit what Allah and His Apostle have prohibited, nor follow the
<br>
religion of truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they pay
<br>
the tax in acknowledgment of superiority and they are in a state of
<br>
subjection.&quot;
<br>
<p>8:12: &quot;When your Lord revealed to the angels: I am with you, therefore make
<br>
firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who
<br>
disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip
<br>
of them.&quot;
<br>
8:39-42: &quot;Say to the Infidels: if they desist from their unbelief, what is
<br>
now past shall be forgiven; but if they return to it, they have already
<br>
before them the doom of the ancients! Fight then against them till strife be
<br>
at an end, and the religion be all of it God's.&quot;
<br>
<p>I read these passages from the Q'ran in the context of the period in which
<br>
Muhhamed is said to have uttered these words on behalf of Allah: After the
<br>
heijira, when Islam was experiencing its first period as a state religion
<br>
backed by an army of believers.  The policy developed by Muhhamed at that
<br>
time was one in which jihad was to be the order of the day until kuffirs
<br>
submitted to the dominance of Islam, paid the jizaat and refrained from any
<br>
act contrary to the dicatates of the Q'ran in public life.  As I wrote in my
<br>
initial post, this is fundamentally a policy of pursuit and enforcement of a
<br>
state religion, an aim that is utterly irreconcilable with the basic
<br>
constitution of modern society shaped by Enlightenment values.
<br>
<p>Although I've abjured the &quot;middle path&quot; of trying to navigate the landscape
<br>
of the sunnah as it is universally acknowledged within the Islamic world
<br>
(i.e. as being guided by the hadith, whichever hadith are accepted as
<br>
authoratative and whatever interpretive doctrine are followed in the
<br>
particular sect or territory in question), I will say that there is a
<br>
SIGNIFICANT body of scholarship out there that supports a violently militant
<br>
and expansionist model of Islam.  One need only spend a few hours navigating
<br>
the many links one can find on the web to the dauntingly large universe of
<br>
sunnah scholarship to see this.  I acknowledge that there are less militant
<br>
schools of thought.  However, it is my strong sense that the &quot;center&quot; of the
<br>
diffuse world of sunnah scholarship and doctrine lies far toward what anyone
<br>
accepting basic Enlightenment values would call &quot;totalitarian&quot; -- i.e. the
<br>
consensus view among the ulamma or immammate is one of a sharia derived from
<br>
the Q'ran and the sunnah that establishes commands governing essentially
<br>
every aspect of individual, social, economic and political life.  Yes, there
<br>
is disagreement about what those dictates are in detail, but there is almost
<br>
universal agreement that there is no support in Islamic texts or doctrine
<br>
for a separation of church and state or the existence of zones of life not
<br>
governed by sharia, however sharia may be interpreted by the specific school
<br>
in question.
<br>
<p>Finally, one can look at the expression of Islam in social and political
<br>
life. I think it is an indisputable fact that there has been a resurgance of
<br>
militant fundamentalist Islam over the last 300 years and that that trend
<br>
has been steadily accelerating.  One cannot find a single country from
<br>
Morroco to the Phillipines where there have not been outbreaks of violence
<br>
carried out by fundamentalist Muslim groups.  While it is certainly possible
<br>
to rationalize each individual expression of this violence in terms of
<br>
secular causes, as is the constant theme of the &quot;post-colonialist&quot; writers,
<br>
these groups are ALL united in espousing an ideology that is 1) founded in a
<br>
totalitarian view of the sharia and 2) expresses profound opposition to the
<br>
basic Enlightenment values of tolerance.
<br>
<p>The most troubling thing to me is the lack of an &quot;ideological firebreak&quot;
<br>
between the most extreme forms of Islamist miltancy and any kind of moderate
<br>
or liberal ideology.  In other words, there is a smooth spectrum between the
<br>
most extreme forms of Islamist totalitarianism and those who claim to be
<br>
more moderate.
<br>
<p>Here's a nice example of a &quot;moderate&quot; Egyptian Islamist group's position
<br>
with regard to basic Enlightenment values:
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Q: What do Ikhwan think about Democracy and presonal freedome?
<br>
<p>This depends on you definetion of democracy, if democacy means that people
<br>
decide who leads them than Ikhwan accept it, if it means that people can
<br>
change the laws of Allah and follow what they wish to follow then it is not
<br>
acceptable. Ikhwan only accept to participate in such systems because more
<br>
benefit will be achived if they do, and more evil will be avoided. A little
<br>
help is better than no help at all.
<br>
<p>About personal freedome, Ikhwan accept personal freedome withen the limits
<br>
of Islam, However, if personal freedome to you means that muslim women can
<br>
wear shorts or muslim men can do Haram stuff then Ikhwan do not approve of
<br>
that. &quot;
<br>
<p>from <a href="http://www.ummah.org.uk/ikhwan/questions.html">http://www.ummah.org.uk/ikhwan/questions.html</a>.  I commend this web site
<br>
that I picked more or less at random from a review of the pronouncements of
<br>
groups that are trying to actually participate in the open political process
<br>
in their native countries.  It shows how the &quot;center&quot; of Islamist thinking
<br>
is constantly radicalized by the inability to draw a line between a moderate
<br>
position and the most radical ones because any failure to express
<br>
totalitarian views is condemned as apostasy.
<br>
<p>... I've run out of time this morning, but I leave to further discussion the
<br>
question of how prevalant the more militant and totalitarian forms of
<br>
Islamism may be.  My &quot;gut guess&quot; is that there is something like 10-20% of
<br>
the Islamic world that have become utterly radicalized, a population of some
<br>
100-200 million people.
