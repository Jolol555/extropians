<p><em>&gt;Not being a lawyer, shouldn't the US have acted according to what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it felt was right? Your argument above makes sense, but I was told
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about two wrongs not making a right a long time ago. It seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me that this is a lot of the problem, using these weapons lowered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those who used them in the eyes of the world, whereas restraint,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or acting according to principles the US espoused, would have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the better option. Unless of course there were other reasons for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;using it other than the publicly announced reasons.
</em><br>
<p>The U.S. did act according to it's principals, it did do what it
<br>
thought was right.
<br>
<p>The issue of the atomic bomb has always been a strange one. We
<br>
killed many more people in the firebombing and other raids, yet
<br>
people try to single out the A-Bomb as something categorically
<br>
different.
<br>
<p>Explain to me the difference between killing 400,000 in the
<br>
firebombing raid on Tokyo vs the 50,000 killed by the bomb in
<br>
either Hiroshima or Nagasaki.
<br>
<p>The estimates were a million U.S. casualties alone to end the war.
<br>
Those who used it felt it was the lesser of two evils.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I have not read the Geneva convention but I'd have thought that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one country signing it binds them to act accordingly, not that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both parties have to be signatories for it to apply. Although, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are talking war here, so it may well be full of loopholes.
</em><br>
<p>The Geneva convention is a contract between two or more parties
<br>
where they agree on the rules of the fight. If they both do not
<br>
sign and abide, there is no contract and almost anything goes.
<br>
<p>Take the current war.
<br>
<p>Ossama Bin Laden in his declaration of war said that he would make
<br>
no distinction between civilians and military personnel, he also
<br>
said it would be confined to men, but he violated that on Sept 11.
<br>
<p>He also used men out of uniform, in a sneak attack, and directly
<br>
targeted civilians.
<br>
<p>So he gets nothing, no rules apply, including quarter. If a member
<br>
of the Taliban or Al-Quaeda raises his hands to surrender it has no
<br>
meaning, they can be shot dead. This is an option of the individual
<br>
soldiers conscience.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The &quot;the Russians would have risked a nuclear war in the future if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it wasn't demoed properly&quot; argument makes a LOT of sense to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much more so than the reason we are given (Japanese surrender).
</em><br>
<p><p>Since this is your opinion no reply is required.
