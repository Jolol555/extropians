</em><br>
<p>Of course, this applied not just during OPEC shenanigans, but when real
<br>
resource supply walls are hit at high economic velocities. Resource
<br>
supply walls impose real inflation upon an economy that no amount of
<br>
interest rate tweaking can counter.
<br>
<p>The current severe drop in consumption of oil since 911 has created a
<br>
glut and price drop to the $18 range which OPEC is now seeking to
<br>
counter with a 1.5 million barrel production cut. This price drop, if it
<br>
is sustained, will hinder any effort at oil independence, although it
<br>
will permit low volume producers from legacy wells to open up their
<br>
wells again to avoid the windfall profits tax. 
<br>
<p>If we are truly interested in reviving the economy and fostering energy
<br>
independence, we need to get rid of the windfall profits tax.
