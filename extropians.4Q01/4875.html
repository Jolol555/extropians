</em><br>
<p>Amara, don't pull your hair out over this.  I was trying to point
<br>
out the middle ground.  I'll to explain why.
<br>
<p>Lets assume you've spent the last decade or so of your life studying
<br>
biotechnology &amp; nanotechnology and are trying to start a company
<br>
to accelerate the approaching wave of those technologies (having
<br>
already started one such company somewhat prematurely and so
<br>
not being particularly enthusiastic about being too far ahead
<br>
of the curve again).  Lets say that you've read all the material
<br>
I've read such that you can really &quot;see&quot; the future, such that
<br>
you can point out exactly where people who consider themselves
<br>
&quot;future&quot; prognosticators, even the moderately good ones such
<br>
as Kaku &amp; Kurzweil, have failed to do their research.  Lets say
<br>
you sit down with someone like Robert Freitas (which I've done)
<br>
and look closely at the situation and ask -- to what extent can
<br>
the wave be accelerated or decelerated? -- and you come to the
<br>
conclusion that the most you could do is change the arrival
<br>
time by +/- 3-5 years (depending on whether you had $10 billion
<br>
to work with or were deanimated and cryonically suspended).
<br>
<p>Only on my most pessimistic days do I think that the inertia of
<br>
our current path will not carry us forward sufficiently fast
<br>
enough that I will be unable to benefit from it (whether I'm working
<br>
either for it or against it).  So &quot;live longer, healthier,
<br>
smarter, stronger, etc.&quot; *will* happen (no matter what I
<br>
personally do).  It is also likely to happen no matter what
<br>
the U.S. government does (within reason).  It will even happen
<br>
despite the efforts of the luddites, greens, etc. (no matter
<br>
what they or we do).  [Yes, I *know* others on the list feel
<br>
differently, but this is about what *I* think.]
<br>
<p>So, knowing that it is going to happen -- no matter what you do --
<br>
then an interesting dilemma appears.  How much is one willing
<br>
to increase ones personal risk of not making it in order to accelerate
<br>
the curve?  Or looking at it another way -- how much of ones
<br>
non-essential freedoms is one willing to sacrifice to ensure
<br>
that you personally make it?
<br>
<p>I've flown over half-million miles in the last 15-20 years.
<br>
When people ask why I'm not signed up for cryonics, I tell
<br>
them its because I view my risk of death from an airplane
<br>
accident as being higher than my risk of death from any
<br>
other cause I can think of.  Generally speaking one does
<br>
not survive airplane accidents in a form suitable for cryonic
<br>
suspension so a suspension contract makes little sense (for me).
<br>
If you were to walk around &quot;knowing&quot; that the chances you
<br>
were going to live thousands of years are probably 99.9%
<br>
(as I've done for most of the last decade) and you also &quot;knew&quot;
<br>
that was going to be true for most of the people alive today
<br>
on the planet (under the age of ~50 or so) -- then the needless
<br>
irrevocable deaths of individuals who would otherwise have been able
<br>
to surf the wave becomes quite significant.
<br>
<p>Much of my time during the last month was devoted to finishing
<br>
a paper on how existing and near-future technologies could
<br>
be used by bioterrorists if they had the knowledge base that
<br>
I have.  I am sure that after reading it most people would
<br>
feel a great deal less secure than they currently do now --
<br>
which is presumably less secure than they did before 911.
<br>
So I take safety and security *very* seriously -- particularly
<br>
when vehicles and technologies that I consider essential components
<br>
of accelerating the wave are being used as WOMD.
<br>
<p>There are tradeoffs to make between being free and surviving.
<br>
The higher the trust and security level within a society the
<br>
greater probability there seems to be that one will survive
<br>
until such a time that even greater freedoms can be granted.
<br>
(I can grant you huge freedoms to do whatever you want when you
<br>
are located on the other side of the galaxy and little you do is
<br>
going to effect me.)
<br>
<p>Until those times come, I will be asking myself questions like:
<br>
Is flying safe?; Is flying worth the time it takes to get through
<br>
the security checkpoints in Seattle?; Is eating out worth the
<br>
risk of food poisoning? (natural or terrorist); Is the small loss
<br>
of freedom of asking ~5000 people in America to talk with law
<br>
enforcement officials about whether they have potential knowledge 
<br>
of terrorist activities a small price to pay for 1 life?  What
<br>
about for 1000 lives?;  Is spending $1 billion a year on the
<br>
development of good treatments for agents that might be used
<br>
by bioterrorists useful?  What about $10 billion?  Etc.
<br>
<p>I think whether you view it as &quot;way out of proportion&quot; has a lot
<br>
to do with ones frame of reference.  My frame of reference is
<br>
that it is *only* the unanticipated or unprepared for that is
<br>
likely to prevent me from living thousands of years.  So I
<br>
spend a lot of time trying to anticipate and/or better prepared
<br>
for whatever it might be.  If I personally feel secure then I'm going
<br>
to be pushing in directions to accelerate the wave.  If I personally feel
<br>
insecure then I'm going to be attempting to find someplace safe to park
<br>
my life until the tornado blows past.  One doesn't get to live
<br>
thousands of years by thinking any other way.
<br>
