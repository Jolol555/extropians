Robert Bradbury noted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The paper author isn't just any &quot;Criswell&quot; -- he is *the* David Criswell of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;star lifting&quot; fame.  Hmmm, lunar power systems after you propose how to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lengthen the lifetime of a star.  Kind of a let down if you ask me. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I liked David Criswell's notion of using solar power to fire arrays of proton 
<br>
cannons at the sun's equator (many centuries from now) to suport a vastly, 
<br>
expanded human occupation of the solar system. Human population was to be in 
<br>
the trillions, or quadrillions, and the idea was to provide additional 
<br>
habitats for this population, by converting the sun into a different sequence 
<br>
star on the hertzprung-russell chart-allowing the stellar life to be 
<br>
sustained to 100 billion years. The material stripped from the sun was to be 
<br>
used to make space habitats.
<br>
<p>This was all before computer tech really took off, and the notion of mind 
<br>
uploading became a meaningful possibility, in the equation.  Now we come to 
<br>
the environmental impact statement of Criswell's proposal; how is hitting the 
<br>
earth with microwave beams going to impact biota, as well as the climate? 
<br>
<p>Clearly, this proposal appears 'down the road' compared to other energy 
<br>
systems such as fossil fuels, renewables, or nuclear. And much of fossil 
<br>
fuels, renewables, and nuclear, apparently, are commercially 'down the 
<br>
road',' also, as far as the 'market' is concerned.
