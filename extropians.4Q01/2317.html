<p>I believe the AI case is worse.  If the AI is sufficiently smarter than you
<br>
are, the containment mentioned above is hopeless.  The AI will simply give you
<br>
some very compelling reason to open the door, which it knows will get you,
<br>
having run a sufficiently close simulation of you.  Cult leaders do this all
<br>
the time with promises of eternal life, endless delights in an after life,
<br>
etc.  A super intelligent AI is going to make the most charismatic cult leader
<br>
look like a carnival barker by comparison.
<br>
<p>The other thing is the &quot;hostile mind&quot; issue.  It depends so much on view
<br>
point.  My cats always put me in this category when I get out the carriers to
<br>
take them to the vet.  I cannot convince them otherwise.  What my dentist did
<br>
to me last month sure seemed hostile to me at the time, but I had to go on
<br>
some level of trust that what she was doing was actually good.  There is no
<br>
way for us to know if an action taken by a super intelligence is good or bad
<br>
until we see the result (which is problematic in general, anyway, because the
<br>
final result of any action is not knowable in finite time).
