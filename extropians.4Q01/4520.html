From: &quot;Harvey Newstrom&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20most%20powerful%20approach%20to%20AI%20ever%20discovered?&In-Reply-To=&lt;013001c186f0$b1dfed00$e55c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; If they really had this discovery, they would make more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money using the technology.  Why sell it to competitors for $50K a pop?
</em><br>
<p>That's like saying &quot;if IBM really had a supercomputer, they would make more
<br>
money using the technology; why sell it to competitors?&quot;
<br>
The answer is: The more computers are in use, the more valuable the technology
<br>
becomes. Likewise, if only one human is literate, literature is not of much
<br>
use. But when many people are literate, then the worth of literature is
<br>
amplified proportionately.
<br>
<p>According to the news story:
<br>
&quot;He predicted that applications developed for the brain OS will be able to
<br>
instill genuine machine intelligence into next-generation &quot;conversational&quot;
<br>
applications such as talking automatic teller machines or fully automatic
<br>
customer-service &quot;personalities&quot; that outperform even a knowledgeable human
<br>
being in answering ad hoc queries. HNC said it will assist participating
<br>
engineers in creating their own AI applications during the technology course.&quot;
<br>
<p>What makes it hype is that &quot;he predicted,&quot; etc., because if an expert system
<br>
is capable of building a more expert system, then the economic principle of
<br>
distribution no longer applies... instead of a goose that lays golden eggs, it
<br>
has become a goose that lays eggs that hatch into geese that lay mega-golden
<br>
eggs, that hatch into geese that lay... a phase transition in intelligence,
<br>
aka singularity. So, if a corporation owns the patent on such devices, it will
<br>
make Microsoft look like a Mom and Pop kitchen table enterprise.
<br>
<p>&quot;When you can buy intelligence, alliances are more important than ability.&quot;
<br>
--Kim Cosmos
<br>
<p>...and has there ever been a time when intelligence could not be bought?
<br>
<p><p><p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
