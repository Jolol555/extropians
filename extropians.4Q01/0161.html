<br>
<p>&lt; None of the researchers are employed by religious organizations and were
<br>
not asked by religious groups to perform the study. Dr. Kwang Y. Cha,
<br>
director of the Cha Hospital and an associate research scientist at OB/GYN
<br>
at Columbia University College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons, funded the
<br>
research through his hospital. &gt;
<br>
<p>Google couldn't find Kwang Y. Cha, except in the original Eureka ref. But
<br>
Cha Hospital sounds a tad dodgy, given that it's the provenance of Dr Cha.
<br>
So...

<p><p>&nbsp;Cha Hospital symposium examines
<br>
&nbsp;future of alternative medicine
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The College of Medicine at Pochon Cha
<br>
&nbsp;University hosted a symposium titled &quot;Traditional
<br>
&nbsp;and Alternative Medicine in the 21st Century&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;yesterday at the Pundang Cha Hospital, south of
<br>
&nbsp;Seoul. Experts from 7 countries, including the
<br>
&nbsp;United States, China, Japan, France, United
<br>
&nbsp;Kingdom and India presented their findings and
<br>
&nbsp;opinions at the symposium. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Cha Kwang-yul, currently professor at Columbia
<br>
&nbsp;University in New York, organized this
<br>
&nbsp;symposium with the purpose to provide
<br>
&nbsp;information on the development of research done
<br>
&nbsp;in alternative medicine and its emergence in the
<br>
&nbsp;international medical arena. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;...
<br>
&nbsp;The symposium consisted of two sessions.
<br>
&nbsp;Session one, titled &quot;Factors that affect practice and
<br>
&nbsp;research of traditional medicine,&quot; was moderated
<br>
&nbsp;by Daniel Eskinazi from the Rosenthal Center for
<br>
&nbsp;Complementary and Alternative Medicine at
<br>
&nbsp;Columbia University. He also presented
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Overview of factors that shape practice and
<br>
&nbsp;research of alternative and traditional medicine&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;as the first paper of the session.  
<br>
&nbsp;Later on in the session, Fredi Kronenberg from
<br>
&nbsp;the same institution made a presentation on
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Academic/funding perspectives in developing
<br>
&nbsp;alternative medicine: Th experience of the
<br>
&nbsp;Rosenthal Center.&quot; Papers were also read by Gail
<br>
&nbsp;Mahady from University of Illinois, Cui Meng
<br>
&nbsp;from China Academy of Traditional Chinese
<br>
&nbsp;Medicine, Kazuhiko Horiguchi from Kawado
<br>
&nbsp;Clinic for Kampo and Acupuncture in Japan, U.
<br>
&nbsp;G. Geeta from Foundation for Revitalization of
<br>
&nbsp;Local Health Traditions in India, Bruce Madge
<br>
&nbsp;from the British Library and Chang Ill-moo from
<br>
&nbsp;Seoul National University. Jean Bossy's paper was
<br>
&nbsp;read by Eskinazi as she was not able to attend the
<br>
&nbsp;symposium. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The second session was on &quot;Traditional and
<br>
&nbsp;alternative medicine in Korea,&quot; with Korean
<br>
&nbsp;speakers on the trend of practice of traditional and
<br>
&nbsp;alternative medicine. Kim Chong-yul,
<br>
&nbsp;ex-president of Kyunghee Medical College
<br>
&nbsp;presided over the session. An overview was given
<br>
&nbsp;by Chun Sae-il of Yonsei University. The session
<br>
&nbsp;dealt with the bio-energy of Korean traditional
<br>
&nbsp;foods, Korean acupuncture techniques, Korean
<br>
&nbsp;QuiKong, Korean medicine and the affects in
<br>
&nbsp;integrating traditional medicine and modern
<br>
&nbsp;medicine. 
<br>
...
<br>
&nbsp;The Pundang Cha General Hospital is the one of
<br>
&nbsp;the first hospitals in Korea to conduct
<br>
&nbsp;collaborated treatment of modern and traditional
<br>
&nbsp;medicine, which accounts for its hosting the
<br>
&nbsp;event. Pochon Cha University was the first in
<br>
&nbsp;Korea to open alternative medicine as an official
<br>
&nbsp;subject in its curriculum. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The organizer, Cha Kwang-yul, was the first
<br>
&nbsp;president of the university and is an active scholar
<br>
&nbsp;in the field of alternative medicine at Columbia
<br>
&nbsp;University in the U.S.

<p>The C.C. (Cha Columbia)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infertility Center is a direct
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extension of the Infertility Medical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Center of the Cha General Hospital
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Seoul, Korea. Headed by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;internationally renowned clinician and researcher Dr.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwang-Yul Cha, the C.C. Infertility Center provides
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specialized care to our Korean community. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, we received the grand prize at the American
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) annual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeting for the first successful delivery in the world
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after using immature oocyte. Our pregnancy rate is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over 25% using immature oocyte in Polycystic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) or Ovum Donation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;program while reducing costs by not administering
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super-ovulation medications during the IVF
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;program. We are also well known for successful
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pregnancies by being the first in the world at using
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the newly established oocyte vitrification method. An
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award was given in 1998 by ASRM for this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplishment. Again in 1998, we received a grand
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prize by ASRM for developing laparoscopic tubal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reanastomosis. We are one of the most advanced and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cost-effective fertility centers in the country with high
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pregnancy rates.
