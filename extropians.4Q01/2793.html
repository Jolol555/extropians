<p><p>Arsenic is a poorly understood element with respect to biology.  It is
<br>
recognized as an essential micronutrient with many actions in the body, but
<br>
its general mechanisms are not known for the most part.  Supplementation is
<br>
necessary in some locales and has been practiced for a very long time.
<br>
<p>In some parts of the world, arsenic deficiency is a chronic problem due to
<br>
lack of local dietary sources and has traditionally been supplemented either
<br>
with arsenic rich food sources that have been imported or the mineral
<br>
itself, mostly to improve fertility and as a cure for wasting.  Some
<br>
indications of arsenic deficiency are weakness, low weight, and infertility.
<br>
It is also thought to have beneficial activity in the cardiovascular system
<br>
and central nervous system, but these aren't well understood.  Trace
<br>
quantities of arsenic have been added to animal feed for centuries to
<br>
improve animal health and weight.
<br>
<p>The biggest source of arsenic in the human diet by far is meat, and seafood
<br>
in particular tends to contain large quantities of it.  Ground water is the
<br>
number two contributor, but by itself does not contribute enough arsenic to
<br>
come close to meeting the proposed RDA for that mineral.  Vegetable sources,
<br>
while frequently containing arsenic, often demonstrate poor bio-availability
<br>
for this mineral.  Many plants have zero bio-availability, even though they
<br>
may contain enough arsenic to be extremely toxic (the arsenic is excreted in
<br>
the urine).
<br>
<p>Which doesn't mean anyone should go around chowing down on arsenic, but the
<br>
toxicity of trace quantities has been highly overstated.  Like chromium and
<br>
other micronutrients, an RDA has not been established yet.  However, the
<br>
estimates for an arsenic RDA actually suggest a larger intake than for many
<br>
other minerals (e.g. several times larger than for chromium).
<br>
<p>Cheers,
