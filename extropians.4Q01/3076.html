<p><em>    &gt; It would be a very weak reading of what I wrote to say I
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; condoned WTC.  I don't and never did.  But
</em><br>
<p>Ah, the obligatory &quot;But&quot; that must without exception follow any hint that the
<br>
WTC horror was less than a nice thing.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;I also don't condone  the pretense that WTC came out of a vaccuum
</em><br>
<p>If it wasn't a quantum vacuum fluctuation then yes something caused it.
<br>
Perhaps in 50 years we'll have enough historical perspective to know
<br>
what it was, perhaps in 50 years I will care what it was. I don't now.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;or the notion that we can just by using enough force eradicate all
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;anger and despair in the mideast and thus make ourselves safe.
</em><br>
<p>You disapprove of the method, military force, but think the goal of
<br>
eliminating anger and despair in the mideast is a proper way to make
<br>
us safe. I approve of the method but think such a goal is totally impractical.
<br>
Nobody knows how to make an entire civilization happy, if we did we'd use
<br>
it on ourselves; my goal is much more modest and we do know how to put
<br>
a bullet in the brain of those trying to kill us.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Perhaps people should bother to understand what I have written
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; before they fly into a rage.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is I understand better than you what you have written.
