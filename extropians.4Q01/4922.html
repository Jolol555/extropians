<p>
Olga,
<br>
<p>I am very glad you asked the questions you did as I think at
<br>
least some of them are very important.  
<br>
<p>Sometimes I feel as if there is a bit of undercurrent here at
<br>
times that might be expressed (if given voice) as &quot;The world and
<br>
all its problems can go hang as long as I survive and the
<br>
technology moves along fast enough and is accessible enough that
<br>
I can continue to survive and progress personally.&quot;   This
<br>
undercurrent, to the extent it is accurate, can lead to rather
<br>
glib responses to some types of problems imho.  And I agree that
<br>
such do us no good.  I will go further and say that I think many
<br>
of them and of this &quot;me-centric&quot; attitude are great dangers to
<br>
our fondest hopes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I personally am very interested in what progress may bode for humas (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthumans) in the future, but what prevents me from calling myself an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian are the somewhat (from my perspective) odd mixture of politics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ayn Rand, for instance.  She's on the extropian reading list.  Er.... isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she considered a joke?  (I read a lot of Ayn Rand in college many years ago,
</em><br>
<p>She is certainly not considered a joke by by many of us who have
<br>
read and studied her fiction and non-fiction works.  I disagree
<br>
with some of her axioms and with several places I believe she
<br>
was not balanced in her reasoning, but I greatly admire the
<br>
intellectual strength and courage that she demonstrated.  She
<br>
thought through the implications of a great many things that
<br>
most people, including many prominent intellectuals, blithely
<br>
considered gospel truth.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so I'm not unfamiliar with her writings, but to take her seriously...yipes!)
</em><br>
<p>If you can refute her philosophy in its most general terms
<br>
(especially if her starting axioms are acceptable to you) I will
<br>
be greatly surprised.  You probably can refute her on specific
<br>
points.  
<br>
<p><p>- samantha
