</em><br>
<em>&gt;to parse some of the stickybuns...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Since the Extropian movement is heavily invested in libertarian

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I had an old link in my history file... End Side-bar).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Checking both the Principles and the FAQ, I see no mention of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;libertarian&quot;.  In fact &quot;politics&quot; is only mentioned once in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;either document and only then from the perspective that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should not &quot;surrender independent judgement&quot; with regard to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>disingenuous...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Libertarianism creeps in on the heels of &quot;freedom&quot;, particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IMO on the &quot;freedom&quot; to evolve.  However(!) the Principles also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cite the importance of &quot;personal responsibility&quot;.  I suspect that

<em>&gt;an individual may have and what communities one views oneself most

<p>non sequitir...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which purportedly stresses individual rights and property
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rights, how do the Extropians reconcile the &quot;open borders&quot; philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; advocated by Extropians,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This trips *right* into the transhumanist ethical dilemma.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'll state it as harshly as I can -- do &quot;individual&quot; rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(from which property rights derive as an enforcement mechanism)
</em><br>
<p>of course property can be held by groups of citizens...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;entitle one to claim a greater share of the computronium (matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&amp; energy) and thereby deny others with relatively equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a priori claims their fair share?
</em><br>
<p>computronium...how is this relevant?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I think this can be simplified -- &quot;Which is better -- natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selection or fairness?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You have once again wandered in a fantasyland of extropian jargona and
<br>
doctrine....massive non sequitir....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I'm fairly sure that I've said it before but it is probably worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repeating -- if you opt for fairness (the human &quot;social animal&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preference most likely) you are likely to end up with sub-optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adaptations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is in some respects a recasting of the captialism vs. socialism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or communism approaches to societal organization (yea, I'm sure the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;readers well versed in political history may slice this analogy into diced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ham, but from my arm-chair position [not too different from J. Q. Public]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it works).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with the fact that most American citizens oppose open borders
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In spite of the fact that most Americans are descended from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people who took advantage of relatively open borders.
</em><br>
<p>How is this relevant?  At what point does this twisted logic end? When
<br>
there are 6 billion people here? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In part this is natural human xenophobia and in part this
</em><br>
<p>That's good...I always respond to labels like &quot;xenophobe&quot; and &quot;commie,
<br>
commie&quot;....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;is simple economics -- wanting to preserve the advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(position, connections, environmental adaptations, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that one has developed over one or more generations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Make it really simple -- Why should I as a taxpayer with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no children in the city of Seattle be paying taxes to educate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the children of the XYZZY class of immigrants?  The only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rational arguments I can make for this are if I plan to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an employer and I expect to need an educated workforce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or an extropian who would like more educated rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people in the world -- but that is probably really stretching
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the public educational system).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The immigration system by its very nature was designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;promote production -- ~200 years ago it was designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;promote the production of furs.  ~100-150 years ago it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;designed to promote the production of metals and food.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;~50-100 years ago it was designed to promote industrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manufacturing.  It is my sense that the immigration policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is now passed on because those of us whose ancestors at one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point were able to use it as a point of leverage feel it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is only just that others should be able to do so as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In other words its a &quot;generous gift&quot; and not a &quot;right&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>The immigration system ALWAYS benefited those who own and hurt those
<br>
who work...
<br>
<p>And now history is used as emotional leverage...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To resolve this problem from an ethical perspective, one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to construct a complete view of precisely what obligation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any human has with regard to the survival opportunities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of any and each other human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Seems as if Extropians would wish to trample
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the individual rights of most Americans by implementing open
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; borders--not to mention taking the food out of the mouths of working
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; class Americans by lowering wages with immigration...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One could have an open border policy with no guarantess of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;rights to work&quot; policy.  With sufficiently strict enforcement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there would be no lowering of wages.  One could have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;right to work&quot; and &quot;pay social security&quot; with no rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to benefits.
</em><br>
<p>why?
<br>
People who tresspass into the USA in the name of stealing benefits of
<br>
citizenship are criminals and should be prosecuted as such. That
<br>
should deter illegal immigration.  The will of the American punlic
<br>
(60% want less immigration) should be enforced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are lots of possible architectures that would create
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a more graduated system between the country from which people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might choose to emigrate and workin the U.S.A.  Adopting such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;architectures places us in the middle of the &quot;fairness&quot; issue and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think that is someplace that the American public and ExI are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;currently unable to reasonably position themselves.
</em><br>
<p>huh? Could you poosibly write in a more convoluted and oblique style,
<br>
as befits this forum?  :=)
