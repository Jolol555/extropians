</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So please, let us start with the true basics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with the providing &quot;true basics&quot; -- the question would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how best to achieve that.  The Afghans have farmed their land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for millennia -- in the face of the current drought, I'm unsure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *what* could be done to rapidly resolve the current crisis.
</em><br>
<p>For starts you could reopen and strengthen all of the
<br>
interrupted food aid programs.  This can be done quite rapidly
<br>
and must be ton to avert disaster (famine). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A mini-loan program for village wells, water purification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facilities and basic food crops would be a place to start.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if people do not know these are available it does no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good. 
</em><br>
<p>A loan program in the midst of starvation this winter is clearly
<br>
not first priority if you wish to save lives.  For rebuilding
<br>
such programs are certainly worthwhile.  It is also very much
<br>
needed, as Amara mentioned,  to clean up the outrageous amount
<br>
of landminds and other unexploded ordinance in Afghanistan.  The
<br>
US has consistently refused to sign landmine treaties and
<br>
produces much of the landmines in the world.  Laos and Cambodia
<br>
are also to this day suffering from landmines and various
<br>
unexploded ordinance from the Vietnam war.  The US still refuses
<br>
to share much of its data about how specific devices from that
<br>
era work with those attempting to find and defuse the landmines. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If people *cannot* read (e.g. much of the younger female
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population), then &quot;free press&quot; doesn't do much good.  You would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to setup a massive top-down education program (this is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Hunger Project does) or other verbal/sight communication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems (e.g. satellite TV).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You can also teach them to read, once they survival is
<br>
reasonably in hand. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Massive foreign &quot;support&quot; systems produce little in the way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people developing sustainable economies and produce lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities to promote corruption (as several efforts to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support Russia in the mid-'90's have shown).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, we did use the Afghanis and all those fighters from other
<br>
countries and their country as a whole in our cold war and we
<br>
have just finished tearing up a bit more of the infrastructure
<br>
and forbidding a lot of food aid from moving in the critical
<br>
period before many areas are closed by winter.  I think we owe
<br>
some reparation and aid big time.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How on earth do you get that from the above?  Not propping up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mad dictators doesn't require you have to bomb anyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was asking a rhetorical question to see what solution Neil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would propose.  The pseudo-dictatorships in the mid-Asia former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soviet Republics did *not* arise from U.S. political or military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions.  They arose purely as a result of the remnents of power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures in the old Soviet communist party.  How would *you*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propose to eliminate them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure I would attempt to directly eliminate them at
<br>
all.  I simply would not prop them up just because they would
<br>
agree to some things my interests would benefit by.  And I would
<br>
still speak against them and do what I could to let the people
<br>
know there are other and better alternatives.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; military rescue operations can be conducted while the U.S. tries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cleanup the mess in Afghanistan?  I'll note that it is *highly*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; unlikely the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan Friendship Bridge would now be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What &quot;military resuce operations&quot; do you have in mind?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The type that took place when exiled Afghan leaders returned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Afghanistan and were captured by the Taliban, or the kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the prisoners in N. Afghanistan attacked the people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whom they had surrendered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The situation at the prison is much more complex than the above
<br>
characterization.  There is some thought that the attack was
<br>
deliberately provoked as an excuse to wipe out all these foreign
<br>
fighters.  This is in keeping with the reputation of the
<br>
Northern Alliance commander in charge.  We helped kill almost
<br>
all of them.  It needs a bit more study.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually there were quite cleanly operating trucking operations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into Afghanistan from Pakistan that brought in the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the food before this war iirc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the reports I've read, these trucking operations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have been reaching Kabul but they were not reaching some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the hardest hit cities further North such as Masur-al-Sharif.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best support lines into those countries are from the central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Asian republics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But we have still stopped many aid lines and programs and
<br>
it is desperately needed they resume and increase.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We shut them down on or about Sept. 16.  You can't insinuate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we made the ability to get aid into the country better when in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact we have refused to let much of the aid in for most of this war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We&quot; didn't shut them down for long.  There may have been several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeks during which the truck drivers thought it was too chaotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take the supplies in, but once it became clear that it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe, I believe those supplies resumed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually we did shutdown several routes and the main bridge and
<br>
kept them shutdown well into December.  It is not just because
<br>
things were chaotic althought that certainly did not help.  And
<br>
no, they did not resume when things were simply safe.  They
<br>
resumed when we let them resume.  Some of the situation is
<br>
unclear since we have also greatly limited reporters in
<br>
Afghanistan.  I am not clear if we have even yet opened up all
<br>
the aid lines.  I do know that some aid groups have been shut
<br>
down because we accused or suspected that some of the aid might
<br>
reach Al Qaeda.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It was Gen. Tommy Franks who kept the above bridge closed for so long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Facts Samantha, not &quot;beliefs&quot;.  The Uzbek's closed the bridge over 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago when the Taliban first came to power.  Please cite something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other than our assisting in the overthrow of the Taliban regime that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have induced Uzbekistan to open the bridge.
</em><br>
<p>It is a fact that Tommy Franks kept one of the bridges closed as
<br>
I can substantiated by a UK Guardian story of a few week back if
<br>
you want me to dig it up.   Many things could induce Uzbekistan
<br>
to open the bridge.  I don't see how that is relevant to the aid
<br>
we ourselves have stood in the way of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As far as I know we still have some aid operations shut down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for fear they might also be of aid to Al Qaeda or make our search
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for bin Laden harder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect any reluctance to resume food supplies to certain areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be more due to their being hijacked by local warlords (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *has* occurred) and the inability to guarantee the safety of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people distributing food to the people who most need it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Regardless of the reasons, people will starve if those supplies
<br>
are not let through.  How is it that with all our military might
<br>
we cannot guard food caravans or aid in the distribution of
<br>
food, medicine and so on?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I hope it is clear that someone who has made significant contributions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an organization such as The Hunger Project who are really trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to address problems such as the sustainable reduction of world hunger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is as concerned as you with regard to the situation of the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Afghanistan.  We may only differ in our perceptions of the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to achieve this.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.
