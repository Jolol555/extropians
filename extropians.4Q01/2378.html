<p>In general I agree, but things aren't as simple as they seem...

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>1. and 2. may be mutually exclusive.  And terrorists rarely die fast
<br>
enough without help.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. Stop meddling in other countries' governments. (Maybe then, fewer

</em><br>
<em>&gt; annoyed at Americans).
</em><br>
<p>I think we should do this, but don't make the mistake of believing that we
<br>
won't be hated because of it.  One of the major complaints the Afgans have
<br>
is that after we helped (and only to a limited degree) them eject the
<br>
Soviets...unlike imperialist powers the world over, we *left*.  They blame
<br>
their civil war on the fact that that we *didn't* meddle.  Of course, we
<br>
could have left them to the tender mercies of the Red Army...and they
<br>
would have loved us for that?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 4. Let people in other countries find what's appropriate for their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture, make their own mistakes, and so on. If they ask for your help,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then give it to them, if you can, and preferably, not with the help of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think we have been doing this more or less.  Can you think of any
<br>
circumstance in the recent past where &quot;help&quot; was given to people who
<br>
*didn't* ask for it in some way?  If &quot;finding what is appropriate&quot; and
<br>
&quot;make their own mistakes&quot; includes the form and structure of government,
<br>
how can we help the people without helping their government?  How can we
<br>
avoid being accused of supporting dictatorships then?  How can we withhold
<br>
help based on the form of government without being accused of &quot;meddling&quot;. 
<br>
How can the &quot;people&quot; do any of those things under an authoritarian
<br>
government?  If we (U.S., government or not) help them change their
<br>
government so they can, how is that *not* meddling?
<br>
<p>Is the World Bank a U.S. government organization?  The IMF?  The Red
<br>
Cross?  Doctors Without Frontiers? Chase-Manhatten Bank? Where do you
<br>
cross the line from government to non-government help?  How does the
<br>
average angry young man (and possible future terrorist) tell the
<br>
difference?
<br>
<p>We can be hated for being an imperial power imposing our will on the
<br>
world, or be hated for withdrawing from the world and permitting evils
<br>
that others perceive (rightly or wrongly) we have the power to eliminate. 
<br>
Or we can be hated for trying to find a middle ground between the two,
<br>
which is what I think the U.S. is and has been doing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4. Practice respect for people, places, and cultures outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the U.S. borders.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  I've lived in Europe and have been painfully embarrassed many
<br>
times by my fellow Americans. I've probably embarrassed myself without
<br>
knowing it.
<br>
<p>Of course, there is a minority in the world that think that &quot;respecting&quot;
<br>
their cultures means not letting them build McDonalds or watch Hollywoood
<br>
movies, even though the vast majority of their neighbors *like* these
<br>
things.  I don't know how to avoid being hated by them, short of
<br>
systematically destroying our own culture. 
<br>
<p>The U.S. seems to be widely accused of &quot;arrogance&quot;, and I can certainly
<br>
understand why people would feel that way.  But if I told the judge that I
<br>
killed my next door neighbor because he was &quot;arrogant&quot;, I don't think I'd
<br>
get any slack in the sentence.
<br>
<p>So, while I agree that we should mind our own damn business, I don't think
<br>
it would make any real change in how much we are hated or in the risk of
<br>
things like Sept 11.  We are rich and powerful, and there will always be
<br>
many people muderously angry with us for not using the money and power in
<br>
a way that they see fit.  
<br>
<p>I see only two real long term solutions:  systematically destroy our
<br>
military and technological capability, reduce the economy to third world
<br>
standards, and shoot anyone who ever made a movie or rock video.  Or we
<br>
can help make the *rest* of the world rich and powerful as well.  But if
<br>
you think people are screaming about our &quot;meddling&quot; and &quot;arrogance&quot; now,
<br>
wait till we try *that* one in earnest.
