</em><br>
<p>Well, look at what they've done with what they've got so far. If one's
<br>
trust rating is to be based in past behavior, they just don't qualify.
<br>
As I've spoken frequently here, truly free societies can only exist
<br>
where there is high trust between individuals. When high trust societies
<br>
absorb large low trust groups into their electorate, the trust quotient
<br>
is diluted and freedom suffers. Nations like India and China are
<br>
relatively low trust societies (as is much of the world), so making our
<br>
freedom subject to their vote at this point in time is simply asking to
<br>
be enslaved. Give them time to 'grow up', they may eventually get to a
<br>
point where they attain higher trust levels.
<br>
<p>Your conclusions are based on a stasist point of view, assuming that a)
<br>
Hitchins never wants such a world, or cannot fathom a future high trust
<br>
world, and b) you yourself are assuming that those countries could never
<br>
attain high trust societies. It is you who are assuming the 'them' vs
<br>
'us' dichotomy to be a permanent condition, so the 'fascism' is in your
<br>
own mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And what would this government most likely decide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;do in order to satisfy its supporters and be reelected? The government would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;probably find that the so-called Western world had far too much wealth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the rest of the world, in particular China and India, had far too little,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and hence, that a systematic wealth and income redistribution would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;called for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are very good arguments for wealth redistribution.
</em><br>
<p>There are never any good arguments for wealth distribution by force.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in them. He wants to scare people into thinking that democracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is somehow equated with the idea that &quot;they&quot; could come and take &quot;our&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth away. In actual fact raising the rest of the world towards the level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of wealth of the developed world would more likely make the developed world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even richer. I won't go into those arguments here.
</em><br>
<p>You don't make the rest of the world richer by taking away everything
<br>
that we have. That is a zero sum worldview typical of lefties who don't
<br>
understand economics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Or imagine, for your own country, that the right to vote were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;expanded to seven year olds. While the government would not likely be made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;up of children, its policies would most definitely reflect the 'legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;concerns' of children to have 'adaequate' and 'equal' access to 'free'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hamburgers, lemonade, and videos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here he uses an absurd scenario to bolster his argument. It draws upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's biases again. Many people automatically think that children are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally irresponsible (the Lord Of The Flies syndrome). I am continually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amazed at how quickly people forget how they thought when they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children. For a year I managed Awaba, a virtual world for Australian kids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I decided to make it an experiment in anarchy and laid out the ground rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early on that there be no laws. There was only one guiding principle: that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people try not to upset each other. What I found was that the kids were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very responsible, helpful, and mature. We had kids as young as 5 years old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming into the world and building and interacting with other kids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Problems were extremely rare.
</em><br>
<p>Only because those who are of a bullying and taking nature were not
<br>
interested in playing your 'pinhead' games. They were already out
<br>
shaking down and ripping off adults in the real world. Designed
<br>
societies work very well in most instances when there is a preexisting
<br>
filter that somehow rigorously excludes bad elements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hoppe's sneering attitude to kids and other groups underlines much of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he says in his article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;One-man-one-vote combined with 'free entry' into government - democracy -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;implies that every person and his personal property comes within reach of -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and is up for grabs by - everyone else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leaving aside the fact that very few places in the world have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-man-one-vote -- most have some kind of inequitable vote distribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built into the system. (But it is better than no vote... and I firmly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe getting better.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, leaving that aside, he never really shows how democracy has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything to do with his demon of &quot;them&quot; grabbing what &quot;we&quot; have. He thinks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that by giving people the chance to vote for self-determination the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing that they will do is steal from their neighbor. He has a very low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion of people, and he shows that time and time again throughout the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article.
</em><br>
<p>Outside of the US, it has been more the rule than the exception that to
<br>
varying degrees, you always get 51% of the people voting to tax 49% of
<br>
the people more than the rest (it even occurs here). Since time
<br>
immemorial, it has always been the rule in democratic systems that this
<br>
was the fatal flaw: that the game was over when the masses figured out
<br>
how to vote themselves bread and circuses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democracy is not the same thing as socialism, and neither of those are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same as communism. Giving people the right to have a say in their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future instead of being ruled by &quot;those that know better&quot; doesn't mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world reverts to pure communism. To equate democracy and communism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either sloppy or intentionally deceptive.
</em><br>
<p>Tyranny of the majority in a low trust society will always result in the
<br>
growth of influence of communist/socialist groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;A 'tragedy of the commons' is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;created. It can be expected that majorities of 'have-nots' will relentlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;try to enrich themselves at the expense of minorities of 'haves'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gee, he is *sooo* paranoid. He really has a fixation that the poor will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come and take away his goodies and keeps harping on this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the past, the only time such uprisings have happened is when the rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have put the bulk of people into servitude and turned themselves into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealthy parasites. However it sounds just like the sort of system he wants,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so in a funny way he would be correct in his paranoia that they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebel, and come and take his stuff away.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, in the US, we doubled the franchise to women in 1919,
<br>
and less than 20 years later we instituted the largest redistribution of
<br>
wealth to the poor in world history. In the 1960's, we instituted the
<br>
Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, and within a decade the welfare
<br>
state had expanded to encompass more than 20% of our populace in
<br>
permanent idolence that would perpetrate through three generations.
<br>
<p>You are correct on one account: the senior citizens have enslaved the
<br>
productive citizens here.
