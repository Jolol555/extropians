<p>It would also take twice as long, even if we could get it started right
<br>
after lunch. (Mmm... lunch.) Assuming you wish to allow your superhumans to
<br>
mature, and they take the standard 15-25 years to do so. Neoteny suggests
<br>
that they might take *longer* than normal, despite the evidence of Eliezer
<br>
and other bright [former] kids. The AI path seems likely to be swifter.
<br>
Still, you note:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;it would seem wise not to put all our

</em><br>
<p>The bigger problem is that now you *are* running into Kantian objections
<br>
immediately, since it's likely that experiments along these lines wouldn't
<br>
work right on the first few dozen or maybe hundreds of kids; you'd be
<br>
producing unpredictably deformed humans as probes. Morally preferable to
<br>
wait for the computational capacity to model complex phenotypic outcomes,
<br>
I'd have thought. True, in the meantime the Singapore or Iraqi governments
<br>
will do it, but they do all kinds of horrid things we shouldn't recommend.
