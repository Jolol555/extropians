<br>
Subject: what I envision
<br>
<p><p>It occurs to me that perhaps I could better express what
<br>
I see as a viable future and how to get there and my
<br>
view on current events by being
<br>
more proactice than reactive.  It is at least less
<br>
likely that my opihions will be seen as a battling
<br>
with the words and thoughts of
<br>
others, or worse yet, with they themselves.
<br>
<p>When speaking of the future I could speak of many levels
<br>
of future to greater or lesser effect.  But I wish to
<br>
first speak of that future I want to see for and among
<br>
human beings on this earth.  Extending it to include other
<br>
beings, especially ones that we create (or at least seed),
<br>
and beyond earth can come later.
<br>
<p>So what is it that I wish to see come to pass?  I want
<br>
a world that goes beyond the premises of STNG - a world
<br>
where the wealth of each and everyone one of us is seen
<br>
as truly maximal only to the extent that the potentials
<br>
of each of us to contribute our own genius and gifts, no
<br>
matter how large or small, are maximized.  I believe that
<br>
world is best which is truly best for all. So what is
<br>
&quot;best&quot;?
<br>
<p>Best is first of all an abundance of all physical
<br>
necessities of life.  Once we have MNT this should not
<br>
present  any insurmountable technical hurdle.  There are
<br>
considerable sociological and psychological hurdles.  We
<br>
have become conditioned to physical scarcity and base much
<br>
of our thinking and institutions upon it.  There is
<br>
considerable difference from what we are used to in a world
<br>
where there is no question of oneself or anyone else ever
<br>
lacking adequate food, shelter, clothing, medicines and tools.
<br>
How will we cope when we have come to believe that we must
<br>
do a great variety of things to insure we have these things
<br>
or have them &quot;better&quot; than others and that if we do not
<br>
work really hard then perhaps we will not have these things
<br>
at all? How are we to go beyond the notion that if we have
<br>
it it is because we &quot;deserved&quot; it and if someone else does
<br>
not have it then it is because they were &quot;undeserving&quot; and
<br>
even &quot;evil&quot;?
<br>
<p>I dream of a world where every single person can study,
<br>
access, learn from and contribute to any information and
<br>
knowledge ever acquired. We can make a world of universal
<br>
information access with no cost barriers or restrictions
<br>
whatsoever.  The use of some knowledge that is deemed
<br>
dangerous might be monitored but there is no reason that
<br>
access has to be.  As the world moves into utter physical
<br>
abundance there is simply less and less reason for
<br>
&quot;competition&quot; and therefore keeping information restricted
<br>
to give &quot;a competitive advantage&quot;.  It is much more to the
<br>
advantage of all of us if all people can access and use the
<br>
information to advance the state of knowledge and technology
<br>
maximally.
<br>
<p>To get to this type of world a huge hurdle is the hurdle
<br>
of violence in all of its many forms.  Between nations the
<br>
enmity and the endless jockeying for power over one another
<br>
must end just as it must end between individuals.  In a world
<br>
of near endless abundance where our wealth increases directly
<br>
in proportion to the well-being of each one, why should we
<br>
be busy seeking power over one another or seeking our good at
<br>
another's detriment?  Again, doing so is based on the
<br>
fundamental deep axiom of scarcity - an axiom which it is
<br>
increasingly in our power to overturn.
<br>
<p>Nonviolence goes still deeper.  We need to learn ways of
<br>
resolving our conflicts and disagreements without violence
<br>
of &quot;fist, tongue or thought&quot;.  It needs to sink in deeply
<br>
that each and every person is an extension of our own
<br>
being - a part of our own success or failure, our own
<br>
happiness or sadness, health or disease.  In short we need
<br>
what many spiritual leaders have taught.
<br>
<p>Nonviolence is built upon assuming that each and every person is
<br>
as valuable, even if temporarily in a very bad and even
<br>
dangerous state, as you yourself or anyone that you respect.
<br>
The criminal is another sibling who is temporarily in what
<br>
amounts to an unsane state of consciousness and actions.
<br>
Surely, people like ourselves who claim to believe in the
<br>
possibility of immortality, cannot easily condemn a person for
<br>
all &quot;eternity&quot; (i.e. kill them or accept killing them) on the
<br>
basis of whatever ill state they are temporarily subject to.
<br>
Surely, we of all people must look beyond the moment's
<br>
presentation of individuals and see also their potential
<br>
and wish for its full flowering.   Of all people we should
<br>
not be able to lightly speak of the death of anyone much less
<br>
millions due to their seeming attitudes of the moment and their
<br>
current anger and animosity toward ourselves or that which
<br>
we hold dear.
<br>
<p>I envision a world where every person will do only that
<br>
work/play/quest that ve most believes is ver own, that
<br>
which most &quot;sings&quot; ver - that ve actually cares about.  I
<br>
believe that with automation and adequate tools and knowledge,
<br>
all tasks needed to keep everything running smmothly and well
<br>
can be taken care of without forcing anyone directly or
<br>
indirectly into work they do not choose for themselves.  I don't
<br>
believe that there is any advantage in the world soon upon us
<br>
in exploiting anyone's labor or consumption.
<br>
<p>Many will say that I have concocted nonsense.  They will say
<br>
that the &quot;reality&quot; is that nature is &quot;red of tooth and claw&quot; and
<br>
that we have no choice but to be vicious until some of us
<br>
&quot;victors&quot;
<br>
create perhaps the &quot;Friendly Sysop&quot; to straighten the mess out
<br>
more gracefully than we were able to or we all check and balance
<br>
each other as we become Jupiter Braisns and beyond armed
<br>
to the teeth lest any other should encroach upon what is
<br>
&quot;mine&quot; as it is only &quot;natural&quot; to expect them to do.   But
<br>
how can this be?  We have the power or soon will have to
<br>
engineer our own genome. We claim to have a deeper and
<br>
deeper understanding of how our minds work.  If this is so
<br>
then surely we are not simply at the mercy of our evolutionary
<br>
programming.
<br>
<p>Just how likely is it that we can survive to Singularity or
<br>
even get there if we continue to see ourselves
<br>
in a scarcity model, to see ourselves as at war (or in that
<br>
&quot;peace&quot; which is only a temporary suspension of open conflict)
<br>
with one another and especially with those others who do not
<br>
think our dreams of our ascendancy and immortality should
<br>
ever come to pass?  How likely is it that we will succeed and
<br>
transcend if we simply destroy any and all who threaten us
<br>
with violence until we can somehow go beyond where they,
<br>
any &quot;they&quot;, can possibly be a threat?
<br>
<p>What if instead we could convert they to &quot;us&quot;?  What if we
<br>
took our power and intelligence and set out to improve
<br>
without ceasing the lot of every single person on this
<br>
planet?  We could do that if we wished.
<br>
<p>It is not beyond our means to feed, clothe, shelter and
<br>
educate everyone on earth even before MNT arrives.  There
<br>
are difficulties but they are not insurmountable,
<br>
especially once it sinks in that there is no secret agenda,
<br>
that we mean exactly what we say.
<br>
<p>Do this and every honest benevolent person and benevolent
<br>
system of thought or belief will be with you.  Do this and
<br>
those that are not benevolent will lose adherents quickly
<br>
as their followers see that there is a clearly superior and
<br>
joyous alternative.  Do this and the world stands a very good
<br>
chance of suriving the ramp up to Singularity and thriving
<br>
throughout it.
<br>
<p>But to do this you have to leave your ego - your assumptions
<br>
that you and your gang/culture know everything and have
<br>
all the best answers and others are all wet, at the door.
<br>
You have to honestly see and admit your individual
<br>
and collective faults and weaknesses in order to correct
<br>
them and go beyond them.  Healing the world and making it sane
<br>
begins with your own wounds and insanity.
<br>
<p>It is because of my fundamental vision of what it is that I
<br>
truly want to help bring into being that I cannot and do
<br>
not support a &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;.  Mounting terror
<br>
and hatred on top of all the anger and hatred that gives
<br>
birth to terrorism solves nothing and takes us ever further
<br>
from what I believe is our best future and perhaps only hope.
<br>
<p>It is because of this vision that I cannot see the disowning
<br>
of any of  my brothers and sisters anywhere on this earth as
<br>
anything but a tragedy of lessening and a deep wound within our
<br>
being.  These wounds require an attempt to heal them.
<br>
<p>There are many areas where this vision is not yet worked out
<br>
and not clear enough.  There may be places where it needs
<br>
amending.  But it is a vision, a set of working goals.  I
<br>
will work to make them actual and will not give up on or
<br>
amend them until ample ingenuity and effort has been
<br>
fully deployed to solve any problems that arise within
<br>
the context of and in congruence with the vision.  In other
<br>
words, amendments will come only in those aspects and
<br>
details that prove truly impossible rather than simply at
<br>
first seeming so.
