Anders asked:
<br>
<em>&gt; How would this work? 
</em><br>
in response to my comment that we might be able
<br>
to get a factor of 10^9 using ballistic heat removal.
<br>
<p>As you are probably aware, I'm basing this on comments made
<br>
by Michael Franks from his paper that was from a Foresight
<br>
Conference a few years back (cited in my primary MBrain paper).
<br>
<p>It looks like nanotubes will do ballistic transport, e.g.

<p>The distances are still short 10^2-10^3 nm, but it provides hope
<br>
for improvement.
<br>
<p>There is also this:

<br>
(which to be honest, I'm somewhat skeptical about...)
<br>
<p>If a way to turn heat into electron velocity can be worked out
<br>
(a not-so-small detail I'd guess), then one can replace the
<br>
phase-change fluid coolant (patented by Henson &amp; Drexler) with
<br>
buckytube heat conducting tubes.  I suspect (though calculations
<br>
would need to be done to be sure) that this allows the 1 cm^3
<br>
nanocomputer to shrink quite a bit giving you a fairly nice
<br>
bump in throughput.
<br>
<p>I asked Michael Franks once about how to magically convert
<br>
the heat into ballistic electron (or proton I suppose)
<br>
velocity but he never provided an answer that I was
<br>
satisfied with.  I suppose its going to be a very interesting
<br>
question to resolve.  If heat is simply the vibration of atoms
<br>
and you have a buckytubes encased in a diamondoid matrix and the
<br>
buckytubes are connected to solid H2 heat sinks what the
<br>
heat removal capacity will be.  Also of interest would
<br>
be whether flowing liquid He through the interior of the
<br>
buckytubes would do any better.  I think the problem hangs
<br>
on the resistance to heat transfer at the interface surfaces,
<br>
e.g. diamondoid-to-buckytube or buckytube to lHe.
<br>
<p>One thing that does occur to me is that there seems to be
<br>
a lot of work going on using carbon nanotubes as electron
<br>
emitters, e.g.:
<br>
<a href="http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT9/Abstracts/Brenner/index.html">http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT9/Abstracts/Brenner/index.html</a>
<br>
You could envision a design of an emitter tube inside of
<br>
a larger evacuated nanotube.  If you can setup magnetic
<br>
fields such that the electrons reliably fly down the evacuated
<br>
tube (kind of like a linear accelerator), then I could see
<br>
the transfer of heat to the emitter and thence to the
<br>
electrons as a ballistic heat removal device.  The
<br>
questions then become how do you channel the heat within
<br>
the nanocomputer *to* the emitters; *what* would the
<br>
temperature of the emitters; and what the velocity of
<br>
the electrons be?  [This is a problem for Spike I think.]
