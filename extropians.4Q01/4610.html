I saw your note in a huge batch of email when I got back to my computer after spending the last five days in the hospital watching my father die. Naturally, I concur completely and send you my condolences.

<p>Hello Ken,
<br>
<p>I want to say my heart goes out to you.  I have not yet gone through this agonizing life experience.  When I know of a man who had a good father that was there for him, I feel a renewed sense of hope for humanity.  It sounds like you had been very blessed to have him in your life.     
<br>
<p>I believe your father still does exist in an afterlife, though I realize you may not.  Still, I think in a way he does live on through the various things he instilled into you.
<br>
<p>This makes me wonder how many extropians had fathers who were really there for them?  Dads who really made a difference in their lives...  
<br>
<p>very sorry for your great loss,
<br>
<p>John
