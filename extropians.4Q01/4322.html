<p><em>    &gt; Getting copied in a destructive manner is different from getting
</em><br>
whacked on
<br>
<em>    &gt; the head and waking up a few minutes later in a few key areas 1)
</em><br>
getting
<br>
<em>    &gt; whacked on the head does not destroy you
</em><br>
<p>&quot;But that's what we're arguing about, I would maintain that getting copied
<br>
in a
<br>
destructive manner and then being rebuilt would not destroy &quot;you&quot; either.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------------
<br>
<p>I am sure you would maintain that, but can you back it up with a logical
<br>
line of reasoning?  I will outline my argument supporting my opinion...
<br>
<p>Assertion: Sentience and subjective continuity is reliant on both the
<br>
pattern of atoms and the atoms themselves.
<br>
<p>1 - Sentience and perceptual continuity is reliant on the pattern of atoms.
<br>
<p>If someone took that atoms that made up your mind, and mushed them up, it
<br>
would not pass the Turing test let alone pass as a reasonable representation
<br>
of you in conversation.  Same atoms, different pattern.  Therefore the
<br>
pattern of atoms is important.
<br>
<p>2 - Sentience and perceptual continuity is reliant on the atoms themselves
<br>
that make up the pattern.
<br>
<p>- non-Destructive copying example -
<br>
<p>I lay on a table, a passive scanner determines the precise location of every
<br>
atom in my body, its type, and what neighboring atoms it is bonded to, and
<br>
proceeds to construct a atomic level duplicate of me.  We are both awakened
<br>
and escorted to separate rooms, the 'copy' is asked if he is able to see
<br>
what the 'original' (me) sees, the 'copy' reports that he can not.
<br>
Therefore the copy is not me, as he does not experience, subjectively, what
<br>
I experience.
<br>
<p>- non-destructive scanning with delayed destruction -
<br>
<p>I lay on a table, a passive scanner determines the precise location of every
<br>
atom in my body, its type, and what neighboring atoms it is bonded to, and
<br>
proceeds to construct a atomic level duplicate of me.  We are both awakened
<br>
and escorted to separate rooms, the 'copy' is asked if he is able to see
<br>
what the 'original' (me) sees, the 'copy' reports that he can not.
<br>
Therefore the copy is not me, as he does not experience, subjectively, what
<br>
I experience.  The 'original' (me) is then killed.  
<br>
<p>Is the 'copy' me? 
<br>
<p>- Destructive copying example -
<br>
<p>I lay on a table, a destructive scanning machine determines the precise
<br>
location of every atom in my body while disrupting the information of the
<br>
previous atom it scanned.  Using the collected information, an atomic level
<br>
duplicate is made of me.  This duplicate is then asked if he is the
<br>
original, as far as he can tell, he is.  Did he experience subjectivity
<br>
continuity of consciousness?  Given the information provided in the previous
<br>
two scenarios, it is reasonable and logical to assume he did not.  'I'  the
<br>
original 'me' therefore did not experience continuity of consciousness.
<br>
Therefore sentience and continuity of consciousness relies on the material
<br>
making up the pattern as well, otherwise it is a copy experiencing its own
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>Since this logical excursion demonstrates that...
<br>
<p>1) Sentience and continuity of perception is reliant upon the pattern of
<br>
atoms
<br>
<p>2) Sentience and continuity of perception is reliant upon the atoms that
<br>
make up the pattern
<br>
<p>Then is it reasonable, logical, and scientific to assume that a 'copy' is
<br>
subjectively not me, but in fact a unique individual of its own.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------------
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;2) and the mechanism that houses  your consciousness never changes.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;That is certainly untrue, getting hit in the head so hard you black out
<br>
must
<br>
make big (temporarily it is to be wished) changes  in your brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>Concussions are caused by the brain slamming against the interior wall of
<br>
the skull and an associated massive firing of nuerons (or something to that
<br>
effect)  While it is likely that some damage occurs to the brain, no
<br>
macroscopic large scale damage is usually reported.  If it is, it is
<br>
associated with a decrease in nueral functionality.  This argument is the
<br>
same as the 'You are not the same person you were years before / some of
<br>
your nuerons die and get replaced' one I outlined before.  The rebuttal to
<br>
that is that not 'ALL' of your nuerons are destroyed and replaced, as in a
<br>
destructive copying system, in fact, only a small number of them are ever
<br>
afffected compared to the overall number of nuerons.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;Living through a session of complete neural cessation also does not
</em><br>
involve
<br>
<em>   &gt;the changing of the physical mechanism housing the consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Not so, expect huge chemical changes, probably physical ones too.&quot;
<br>
<p>By 'changing the physical mecahnism housing the concioussness' I was
<br>
referring to the fact that a destructive scanning / copying systems destroys
<br>
and replaces each and every one of the molecules comprising your nueral
<br>
structure in a short period of time.  This is a far cry from a few hormones
<br>
being released.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I can be reasonable sure that when I go to sleep at night I don't die
</em><br>
for a
<br>
<em>    &gt; few reasons 1) Hooking me up to any kind of machine that measures
</em><br>
brain
<br>
<em>    &gt; activity would never measure any absolute cessation in activity
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Not in normal sleep but it would under deep anesthesia. When you go to the
<br>
hospital to have your tonsils removed are you the same man when you walk
<br>
out?&quot;
<br>
<p>Are you saying that nueral activity completes ceases under deep anesthesia?
<br>
I am highly skeptical of that claim.  You are still breathing?  You brain is
<br>
still regulating metabolic functions, hormone releases, etc. etc.  I
<br>
seriously doubt there is a complete ceasation of nueral activity, as that
<br>
would mean you are brain dead, and need a machine to keep you breathing and
<br>
alive.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;The molecules and atoms that make up my mind and  house my
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;consciousness are never observed to change form or shape during the
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;course of the evening.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I don't understand this obsession with atoms, there are no scratches on a
<br>
hydrogen atom to tell one from another, they are far from unique, if they
<br>
can't even give this interesting property to themselves they can't confer
<br>
it to us.&quot;
<br>
<p>The 'obsession' with atoms corresponds to this obsession that 'how do you
<br>
know when you sleep you arent copied' that is unscientific, irrational, and
<br>
illogical.  I say this because it is unscientific, irrational, and illogical
<br>
to assume something happened becuase no evidence exists to suggest it did
<br>
not happen.  Scientists do not roam around assuming that there are invisible
<br>
dragons floating in thier garages, alien clones in place of the president,
<br>
or evil gnomes stealing thier care keys merely because these things exist in
<br>
the realm of the possible and have no evidence proving they are *not*
<br>
occuring.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I can also be reasonably sure that I was not murdered last night
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Yes, you can be reasonably sure you were not murdered last night,
<br>
of course you can't be absolutely sure of anything. I think.
<br>
Anyway a more interesting question is if you were murdered last night
<br>
and replaced by a &quot;copy&quot; is there any rational reason to be upset about
<br>
it this morning? I can't think of any.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the sense that a sentient being was lost to the universe, yes there is a
<br>
reason to be upset.  Of course, that question would be like asking the
<br>
'copy' &quot;Are you upset we made you?&quot;  The copy, who isnt aware that he is a
<br>
copy, would probably respond with a resounding 'No'.  That does not relate
<br>
to the validity of subjectivity continuity in question though.  
<br>
<p>But, as I have outlined multiple times, simple because you could have been
<br>
murdered and couldnt tell that you were *doesnt* mean that you *were*
<br>
murdered.  Should I awake to fine blood and brains splattered over the wall
<br>
and some large elaborate scanning and molecular assembly device next to my
<br>
bed with a sticker that says 'Copies R Us' I may have reason to suspect I
<br>
may have been murdered and copied.  But since I have yet to awaken to either
<br>
of these things, I find it just as likely and reasonable to assume that I
<br>
have been murdered and copied as it is reasonable to assume faeries, gnomes,
<br>
demons, elves and witches are roaming the lands.  
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;As I pointed out in my original response to this, replacing one atom at
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>    &gt;time is far different from replacing all atoms at once. [...]  The RATE
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>    &gt;the replacement is the key difference.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;So there must be a fastest permissible rate, if the copy is made 50% too
<br>
fast
<br>
does it make it 50% you? Or perhaps it works like a switch and if the copy
<br>
is made
<br>
.00000001% too fast it's not you at all.&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, there probably would be, as replacing one nueron at a time (every
<br>
second for instance) would not be something I would consider a loss of
<br>
contunity of concioussness any more than I would consider replacing all
<br>
*but* one nuerone a continuity of subjective experience.  Of course,
<br>
replaceing one nueron at a time would take 100 trillion seconds, or ~31
<br>
million years, a little to long for my taste.  But even replacing 1/1000 of
<br>
your nuerons per second would equate to a replacement time of only 1,000
<br>
seconds.  To err on the side of caution and hopefully make sure that I would
<br>
have subjective continuity of conscioussness then if you spread out the
<br>
replacement over the course of a year, there are 3.15 x 10^7 seconds in a
<br>
year, so replacing 3.17 x 10^7 nuerons per second would take about a year.
<br>
At any given second, fewer than 1/31 millionth of your neurons were being
<br>
replaced, or 3.1 x10^-7 %, if my calculations are correct.  That is
<br>
certainly a number I would feel comfortable with.  But if not, take 10
<br>
years, thats just about 1/300 millionth of your nuerons.
<br>
<p>&quot; And then there is the problem that Einstein
<br>
tells us that there is no one true objective rate of change, it depends on
<br>
the
<br>
observer.&quot;
<br>
<p>Perhaps you could elaborate on the relevance of that statement, A little
<br>
confused as to how that relates to the question at hand.
<br>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you could say it's you if at any one time you don't change
<br>
much, but if I make the &quot;any one time&quot; a nanosecond and then blow you up
<br>
with
<br>
dynamite you won't change much.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Kurzwiels 'Age of Spiritual machines' &quot;The reset time on neural firing
</em><br>
is about 5 milliseconds, permitting only about 200 calculations per second
<br>
in each neural connection,&quot;  Therefore, if you change or alter the state of
<br>
an individual nueron (or copy it) in a period of time shorter than its
<br>
quickest firing time, your brain would never know the difference.  So copy
<br>
it (or change it to a silicon based nueron) in less than 1/200 of a second
<br>
(or, 1/1,000 of a second to be safe).  If you could imagine a large cog that
<br>
is spinning and hitting a cam, if it hits the came once every 10 seconds,
<br>
then taking one second to replace that cam will make no difference, as long
<br>
as you are not doing it at the instant it is being hit.  This, of course,
<br>
relates back to the argument of copying 'all' your nuerons at once faster
<br>
than 1/1000 of a second, but the same argument about how many nuerons are
<br>
replaced applies to that question.  
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;if a copy is made with a passive scanning system and we are both
</em><br>
revived,
<br>
<em>     &gt;do we perceive the same thing?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;You could be perceiving the same thing, it depends on how the experiment is
<br>
set up.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yeah, if you are in the same room looking at the same thing you are
<br>
experiencing the same thing.  But turn the 'copy' around or bring him into
<br>
another room that is a different color, and then ask yourself if they are
<br>
experiencing the same thing.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you are not seeing the same thing then the memories of the two of you
<br>
will be
<br>
different and you will no longer be copies. You'll each go your separate
<br>
ways.&quot;
<br>
<p>That is indeed the case, you are two seperate individuals.  It can certainly
<br>
be argued that you are two seperate individuals from the very moment the
<br>
copy is created, since you do not subjectively experience the same thing.
<br>
As I outlined in my 'non-destructive copying' example above.
