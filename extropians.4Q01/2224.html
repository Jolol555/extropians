This reminds me of a passage from the Illuminatus! Trilogy:
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I was young and ignorant of everything outside ten million books
<br>
I'd gobbled and guilty-unsure about my imaginative flights away from my
<br>
father's realism and of course stoned of course but I finally understood
<br>
why he was watching me that way, it was (this part of it) pure Zen,
<br>
there was nothing I could do consciously or by volition that would
<br>
satisfy him and I had to do exactly that which I could not not do,
<br>
namely be Simon Moon.  Which led to deciding then and there without any
<br>
time to mull it over and rationalize it just what the hell being Simon
<br>
Moon or, more precisely SimonMooning, consisted of, and it seemed to be
<br>
a matter of wandering through room after room of my brain looking for
<br>
the owner and not finding him anywhere, sweat broke out on my forehead,
<br>
it was becoming desperate because I was running out of rooms and the
<br>
Padre was still watching me.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nobody home,&quot; I said finally, sure that the answer wasn't good
<br>
enough.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's odd,&quot; he said.  &quot;Who's conducting the search?&quot;
<br>

<p><em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... If the experience is a void within a void, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then something has got to recognize the void as an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, and the act of recognizing it would be connected 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to some aspect of a sense experience wouldn't it?
