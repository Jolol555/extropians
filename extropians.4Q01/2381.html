<br>
aware of these mental constructs internally?  
<br>
We tie them to symbols, language, etc., which are the memories of sensory
<br>
experience.  The question is:  are there internal events which could be
<br>
used for this purpose?  Emotions come to mind, although they, too, are
<br>
composed of sensory events.  Are there purely internal events not tied to
<br>
any sensory input of which we are aware or can become aware?&lt;  
<br>
<p>Repost:  Here is my thought:  It seems that there is a &quot;current
<br>
non-sensory&quot; (Max More phrase which he and I agreed upon works for us when
<br>
aruging this topic today) experience that helps to explain the state a
<br>
person experiences when he or she does not rely on past sense input vs a
<br>
current (immediate) conjecture/experience.  A mathematician can conjure up
<br>
a formula in her head in a present/current experience.  However, her
<br>
ability to experience/conjure it is based upon her *past* experience of
<br>
knowing what the formula looks like.  We can conjecture ideas, but usually
<br>
they are based on past information.  We can conjure ideas in the current
<br>
without sensory input, although it seems that the conjectures stem from
<br>
past sensory experience.
<br>
<p>If a person is born without vision, audition, the sense of touch or feel,
<br>
an inability to smell, or to experience balance, that person resides in a
<br>
void with only the innate mental programming and the functioning of brain
<br>
waves.  He cannot hear the outside world, see it, taste it, touch it, feel
<br>
it or perceive it through balance.  What type of sensory experiences does
<br>
this person have?
