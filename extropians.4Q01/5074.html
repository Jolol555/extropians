<p>
[delurking for a short while]
<br>
<p>Whilst I agree with the sentiment of Eliezer Yudkowsky's post, and know that
<br>
he has devoted his own life to getting from here to there, I am not
<br>
confident that our current technological acceleration will decrease the
<br>
current gap between the advanced nations and the poorest cultures. There are
<br>
states in Africa whose inhabitants are sunk in a state of immiserisation
<br>
that is pitiful to behold.
<br>
<p>Bruce Sterling's &quot;Islands in the Net&quot; posits a future where these regions
<br>
opt out of the international architecture or unable to amass the resources
<br>
necessary for entry to the global system. They are effectively left behind.
<br>
<p>There are those who will choose not to participate in the future on
<br>
religious, moral or political grounds and it is their right to opt out so
<br>
longer as they do not hinder others who wish to opt in.
<br>
<p>However, there are millions who are too poor, too uneducated and too
<br>
immersed in their own culture to have been given their opportunity to
<br>
consider the paths of knowledge that we take for granted. We cannot perceive
<br>
these individuals or their cultures as contributing in any way to the
<br>
futures discussed on this list in the short or medium term (and I note
<br>
Robert J Bradbury's radical and thought-provoking essay on Afghanistan when
<br>
he looked at this problem).
<br>
<p>Do we accept that those &quot;luddites&quot;, who are too poor and unschooled to
<br>
understand the aims and goals of Transhumanism, the Singularity Institute or
<br>
Extropianism, will follow on their own path of development decades or
<br>
centuries after the West and that we cannot guarantee that they will also be
<br>
lifted by the technological tsunami.
<br>
<p><p>Philip Chaston
<br>
<p>We live in a world we ourselves create.
<br>
