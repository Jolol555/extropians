&lt;&lt;But I doubt in the short term we have the conversion capacity for this to
<br>
be particularly useful.  As with many other things its the inertia against
<br>
the rapid construction of manufacturing capacity that hangs you out to dry.
<br>
<p>Robert&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, indeed. But with the death of 3500 Americans, in the attacks on the WTC, 
<br>
and DC, I, for one, would rather build such conversion plants, in My Back 
<br>
Yard, then fill Wahabbi pockets, so they can turn around and undermine 
<br>
America. Consider me the 1st anti-NIMBY on the list. IMBY? Inertia may give 
<br>
if patriotism supervenes gas tank prices, although this requires determined 
<br>
leadership, as well as anti-market sensibilities.
<br>
<p>Economics, despite the dry crunch of numbers, is also the observation of 
<br>
crowd behavior when they buy and sell things. The science is dispassionate, 
<br>
but the subjects themselves are emphatically not. Lets build the plants, pay 
<br>
more, and sink the Islamic Fundies, whose stupidities have caused so much 
<br>
sorrow in the world.
