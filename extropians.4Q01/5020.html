As I don't share, at least for now, Eliezer's convictions about the
<br>
&quot;Singularity&quot; (which are in fact not part of the Extro Principles), I
<br>
cannot really say &quot;me too&quot; on this.
<br>
<p>But I do share his sense of proximity to all human beings, in light of
<br>
the &quot;cosmic perspective&quot; and otherwise, and of course, if there are
<br>
people here mainly concerned with race issues they are in the wrong
<br>
place ; go away ! (for Newton sake)
<br>
<p>However I do find unfortunate that the post alludes to Mike's &quot;Indian&quot;
<br>
post in this context, as to me it was only Olga's interpretation (and
<br>
further quiet insistance) that was problematic.
<br>
<p>I love the openness and independence from PC baggage that I find here,
<br>
so please keep it that way. People should not feel threatened that if
<br>
they say something possibly un-PC they will be responsible for long
<br>
pointless flames. It is impossible to please everyone and to take into
<br>
account any out-of-control interpretations ; nor is it our business to
<br>
do so.
<br>
<p>And finally, I think the problem of the list (which I enjoy very much
<br>
all the same) is not xenophobia but the fact that some contributors
<br>
want to convince everyone (or only one person, but publicly, for some
<br>
reason) of their political ideas and historical takes about things
<br>
past, rather than actually think about the future and cover new
<br>
ground.

<em>&gt; I have to confess, some of the discussion on Extropians these days is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making me feel sick to my stomach.  It is enough to make me seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider leaving, possibly for good, or until someone else informs me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list has made a recovery.  If Extropy and ExI takes a serious hit from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the xenophobia now being tossed about on the mailing list in the name of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free speech, don't say I didn't warn you, because transhumanists in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general *are* being held responsible for what gets said in these public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forums.  I am sick and tired of hearing about how transhumanism (or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity!) is a form of Social Darwinism in which the slow runners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are forced out of the race, but after watching the debate on the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these past months, I can see why the idea keeps popping up.  I'm writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this message in the hopes that those who have joined the list only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently can get a taste of what transhumanism is really about - that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas now being expressed don't represent the majority opinion, but only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the opinions of those posters who are *still* posting, instead of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given up months ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the child of two science fiction readers, I grew up reading books that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preached peace and tolerance toward other life forms, whether they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hands or tentacles, whether they breathed oxygen or liquid helium, as long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as they were sentient.  Tolerance toward other *human* countries was so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious that it rarely even needed to be stated explicitly.  Where there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were group conflicts, the good guys were generally &quot;humanity&quot; - although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes it was humanity that was in the wrong, and if so (the books
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said) a real good guy would still be sure to fight on the side of right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even against their own species.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unnoticed in these dramas of good against evil was the implicit notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one species, one faction.  The unity of humanity was taken for granted;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the books tried to teach was tolerance of *aliens*.  Or at least that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was the way I saw it when I was, oh, nine years old or thereabouts.  Today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a more detailed view of science fiction, and yes, I can see that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of it implicitly accepts the idea of human factions by preaching that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human factions ought to be nice to each other - but I still think that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best argument of all is the one my ears heard initially, that humanity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really one world, one species, one faction, all in the same boat,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of whatever short-term arguments currently plague the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as I'm concerned, this is part of what transhumanism is all about. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we can learn that uploads and AIs and augmented humans are on our side,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it implies - as a simple, even overlooked corollary, which is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than explicit preaching - that all humans must be on the same side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only the most clueless of Singularity gradualists, in severe hard takeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denial, could even begin to imagine that the Singularity was an argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Social Darwinism; it is cluelessness of the same order as arguing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity concept leads to passivity.  If the value of the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world is a quadrillion dollars, and a quintillion dollars of new wealth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created by an egalitarian superintelligence, the previous distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth becomes irrelevant; ripples erased by a tidal wave.  *Any* wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created by a Friendly AI, or created by an altruistic egalitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman such as a transcended Eliezer or Samantha, is an equalizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force that smoothes over or completely wipes out the old divisions between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans.  The Singularity meme is a psychological force that mediates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against any form of prejudice by showing that all inequalities are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporary, even genuine inequalities; it doesn't matter who has an IQ of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 130 and who has an IQ of 90 today, if both can cooperate to have an IQ of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 180 in a few years.  And the *real* Singularity is a fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; egalitarian force because I expect the Singularity to completely ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the faction fights that humans spend so much time pursuing.  Nor does gray
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goo respect national boundaries.  We win together, or lose together.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are all in the same boat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are no &quot;Indians&quot;.  There are no &quot;Afghani&quot;.  There are only humans. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanism, and Singularitarianism, are basically egalitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies, because they permit the analysis of cosmic perspectives, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you look through a cosmic perspective the modern-day divisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between humans become absurd.  There is no reason why the happiness of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American computer programmer should weigh more in my calculations than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness of an Indian computer programmer.  They are both the same kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of entity.  They are both evolved biological organisms.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason why one would have any greater intrinsic worth than the other. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans may spend most of their day dividing into factions and fighting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that doesn't mean the factions are real, it just means that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people sadly lack the perspective of species-wide unity which is provided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by thinking about transhumanity and uploads and AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, that's what it's really about.  I think it'd be nice if everyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agrees with this reasoning posts a &quot;Me too!&quot;, and everyone who disagrees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the argument but agrees with the conclusion posts a note saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well.  The people who are new to the list need to see something to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outweigh some of the poisonous remarks that seem to be getting so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airtime.  Of course I fear that most of the good guys in this battle may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have already gotten sick of the list and unsubscribed, so it may be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; late.  But for the record, I want to say that there was a time when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would never have needed to post this message, and *that* is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism is *really* about, no matter what happens to this mailing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list.
