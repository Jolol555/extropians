<p>
So, the little mechanisms in my head seem to have turned over, such that it's
<br>
time to try to Do Something with my life, and I want to go to grad school, in
<br>
some sort of cognitive science program.  What I've said for years I wanted to
<br>
do Sometime, only Sometime is Now.  Or next year, I guess, given admissions.
<br>
<p>So if anyone has advice, whether about applying in general or about specific
<br>
programs or schools to apply to, it'd be welcome.  As background, I've liked
<br>
Hofstadter's type of work as expressed in _Fluid Concepts and Creative
<br>
Analogies_, and Pinker's _How The Mind Works_ was a recent catalyst, towards
<br>
&quot;this is cool, damnit, I want to help&quot;.  My assets are a planetary science
<br>
degree from Caltech, with a crappy GPA, and not much releated coursework,
<br>
although I should be able to get a good GRE score.  So applying is a bit more
<br>
intimidating than when I was headed for undergraduate school as a high school
<br>
prodigy.
<br>
<p>Advice should probably be sent directly to me, since I haven't been
<br>
reading listmail regularly in quite some time.
<br>
<p>Thanks!
<br>
<p>-xx- Damien X-)
