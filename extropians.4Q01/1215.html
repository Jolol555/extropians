<p>
A single particle [the example is discussed in references 4, 2, 1]  
<br>
at time t_0 is (preselected) in the state  
<br>
|psi_0&gt; = 3 ^ (-1/2) ( |a&gt; + |b&gt; + |c&gt; )
<br>
and at a later time t_f is (postselected) 
<br>
in the state |psi_f&gt; = 3 ^ (-1/2) ( |a&gt; + |b&gt; - |c&gt; )
<br>
where |a&gt;, |b&gt; and |c&gt; correspond to the particle being found 
<br>
in 3 boxes: A, B and C, respectively. (The N boxes case
<br>
is discussed in reference 3.)
<br>
<p>At the intermediate time t_i, where t_0 &lt; t_i &lt; t_f, 
<br>
a measurement is performed on the system.
<br>
<p>The ABL rule [see reference 5] states that if a measurement
<br>
is performed, at time t_f, on this system, with the above 
<br>
preselection and postselection of states, the probability
<br>
for an outcome of either a or b (eigenvalues corresponding
<br>
to find the particle in box A or in box B, respectively) is 100%.
<br>
<p>That is to say, the intermediate measurement cannot project 
<br>
the initial state |psi_0&gt; onto the state 2 ^ (-1/2) ( |b&gt; + |c&gt; ) --
<br>
particle not found in A -- or onto the state  2 ^ (-1/2) ( |a&gt; + |c&gt; )
<br>
-- particle not found in B --. That's because both states 
<br>
are othogonal to the final state |psi_f&gt;. Both states are 
<br>
then impossible.
<br>
<p>As long as we keep the QM formalism and the ABL rule,
<br>
in each case any particles (which end up postselected) 
<br>
are ones which could not have been in any box except
<br>
the one which was opened, be it A or B.
<br>
<p>Possible solutions? There are some. In example....
<br>
<p>1. QM formalism is right. There is no paradox. That's real.
<br>
<p>2. QM formalism is right. That's not real. QM does not speak
<br>
of reality.
<br>
<p>3. Counterfactuals. To make a claim about the elements 
<br>
of reality of an individual system we have to consider the *physical* 
<br>
situation involved in an individual run of the experiment. But here,
<br>
in each run, we have to make a *choice* to measure A or B.
<br>
If we choose A, all postselected particles had to be found
<br>
in box A. If we choose B, all postselected particles had to be found
<br>
in box B. But the property of being, with certainty, in any one 
<br>
of those 2 boxes (depending on wich one is opened) cannot apply 
<br>
to the *same* *individual* particle in *any* given run of the
<br>
experiment.
<br>
<p>4. We cannot use the ABL rule here [see reference 6], because
<br>
of the counterfactuals.
