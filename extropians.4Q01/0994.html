</em><br>
<p>It is a common misconception that the Y2K bug never occurred.  I can
<br>
personally report that many major failures were found and corrected in
<br>
advance.  Many major failures actually were not found and were corrected
<br>
shortly after Y2K.  Major financial and industrial institutions lied and
<br>
covered up any problems because they were embarrassed to have missed them
<br>
after so much hype.  I myself personally tested and detected many Y2K
<br>
failures and saw them fixed after the event.  I also personally have seen
<br>
massive failures by institutions that publicly claim that they had zero
<br>
failures.
<br>
<p>The fact is, Y2K was a major disaster which was predicted, corrected,
<br>
mitigated and hidden after the fact.  We were very lucky that it occurred
<br>
over a weekend and that most businesses were not depending on the
<br>
infrastructure until Tuesday morning after the three-day holiday weekend.
<br>
<p>I actually predicted that IT professionals would be blamed for Y2K no matter
<br>
what.  If failures were announced, they would have been seen as failures of
<br>
IT.  If failures were not announced, the IT people would be seen as crying
<br>
wolf.  Most institutions opted for the latter, preferring to tell there
<br>
customers that there was never really any danger.
