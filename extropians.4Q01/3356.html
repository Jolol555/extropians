<p><em>&gt;Eisenhower, King, Nimitz, MacArthur, and many others all agreed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;H&amp;N had no meaningful military value.  Nobody, not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proponents, thought the A-bombs would inhibit Japan's ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fight the war.
</em><br>
<p>The people you mentioned all thought we could have won the war
<br>
without the bomb (and with a million casualties) and therefore it's
<br>
use was to them unnecessary.
<br>
<p>The opinions of generals and admirals who were not the ones dying
<br>
on the beaches of Iwo Jima and Tarrawa, or going to die on the
<br>
Japanese mainland, are of no concern to me. I know what relatives
<br>
who were there thought then, and thought until their deaths.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;It was a terrible thing, but thank God we had it.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Numerous proponents of the bomb thought it would inhibit Japan's
<br>
ability to fight the war, and Emperor Hirohito's surrender speech
<br>
directly credits it's use with the surrender. So in my opinion, and
<br>
many others, the proponents were correct.
