First of all, let's get one thing completely straight.  The term
<br>
&quot;transhuman&quot; is sometimes used as if it meant &quot;transhumanist&quot;, which I
<br>
object to, but is nonetheless an existing usage.  The term &quot;posthuman&quot; is
<br>
absolutely reserved for genuine posthuman entities.  You can be a
<br>
posthumanist, but not a posthuman.
<br>
<p>With that out of the way, your strategies are still messed up.  They
<br>
require far too many people to function.  A research project may require
<br>
serious funding and serious people, but at least it doesn't require a
<br>
majority of an entire country's population.  Strategies that require a
<br>
majority of a population to participate have been known to succeed.  The
<br>
American Revolution succeeded.  Martin Luther King succeeded.  But
<br>
anything on that massive a scale takes billions of dollars, a core group
<br>
of activists willing to devote their entire lives to the problem, and even
<br>
then it still takes a generation to set up the initial conditions if they
<br>
haven't been set up already.
<br>
<p>You don't have that kind of time, and furthermore you're treating this
<br>
whole issue like a contest for the position of tribal chief.  The
<br>
objective here is not to take over the existing tribe or go split off your
<br>
own.  This is about technology.  If you're still interested in seceeding,
<br>
I suggest you go read &quot;How To Start Your Own Country&quot; so that you can
<br>
become discouraged enough to give up.
<br>
<p>Maybe I'm being too harsh here.  I guess a lot of these ideas look a lot
<br>
less silly if you're planning for a 50-year or, ha ha, 100-year outlook. 
<br>
But try pretending, as a mental exercise, that everything you do with your
<br>
life has to be completely finished by 2008 to do any good, and see what
<br>
that does to your perspective.
