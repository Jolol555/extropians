<p><em>&gt; Well, all those things are needed but don't you think you better

</em><br>
<em>&gt; So please, let us start with the true basics. 
</em><br>
<p>I agree with the providing &quot;true basics&quot; -- the question would be
<br>
how best to achieve that.  The Afghans have farmed their land
<br>
for millennia -- in the face of the current drought, I'm unsure
<br>
*what* could be done to rapidly resolve the current crisis.
<br>
A mini-loan program for village wells, water purification
<br>
facilities and basic food crops would be a place to start.
<br>
But if people do not know these are available it does no
<br>
good.  If people *cannot* read (e.g. much of the younger female
<br>
population), then &quot;free press&quot; doesn't do much good.  You would
<br>
have to setup a massive top-down education program (this is what
<br>
The Hunger Project does) or other verbal/sight communication
<br>
systems (e.g. satellite TV).
<br>
<p>Massive foreign &quot;support&quot; systems produce little in the way of
<br>
people developing sustainable economies and produce lots of
<br>
opportunities to promote corruption (as several efforts to
<br>
support Russia in the mid-'90's have shown).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How on earth do you get that from the above?  Not propping up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mad dictators doesn't require you have to bomb anyone.
</em><br>
<p>I was asking a rhetorical question to see what solution Neil
<br>
would propose.  The pseudo-dictatorships in the mid-Asia former
<br>
Soviet Republics did *not* arise from U.S. political or military
<br>
actions.  They arose purely as a result of the remnents of power
<br>
structures in the old Soviet communist party.  How would *you*
<br>
propose to eliminate them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; military rescue operations can be conducted while the U.S. tries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cleanup the mess in Afghanistan?  I'll note that it is *highly*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unlikely the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan Friendship Bridge would now be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What &quot;military resuce operations&quot; do you have in mind?
</em><br>
<p>The type that took place when exiled Afghan leaders returned
<br>
to Afghanistan and were captured by the Taliban, or the kind
<br>
when the prisoners in N. Afghanistan attacked the people to
<br>
whom they had surrendered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually there were quite cleanly operating trucking operations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into Afghanistan from Pakistan that brought in the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the food before this war iirc.
</em><br>
<p>According to the reports I've read, these trucking operations
<br>
may have been reaching Kabul but they were not reaching some
<br>
of the hardest hit cities further North such as Masur-al-Sharif.
<br>
The best support lines into those countries are from the central
<br>
Asian republics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We shut them down on or about Sept. 16.  You can't insinuate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we made the ability to get aid into the country better when in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact we have refused to let much of the aid in for most of this war.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;We&quot; didn't shut them down for long.  There may have been several
<br>
weeks during which the truck drivers thought it was too chaotic
<br>
to take the supplies in, but once it became clear that it was
<br>
safe, I believe those supplies resumed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was Gen. Tommy Franks who kept the above bridge closed for so long.
</em><br>
<p>Facts Samantha, not &quot;beliefs&quot;.  The Uzbek's closed the bridge over 5
<br>
years ago when the Taliban first came to power.  Please cite something
<br>
other than our assisting in the overthrow of the Taliban regime that would
<br>
have induced Uzbekistan to open the bridge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as I know we still have some aid operations shut down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for fear they might also be of aid to Al Qaeda or make our search
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for bin Laden harder.
</em><br>
<p>I suspect any reluctance to resume food supplies to certain areas
<br>
may be more due to their being hijacked by local warlords (which
<br>
*has* occurred) and the inability to guarantee the safety of the
<br>
people distributing food to the people who most need it.
<br>
<p>I hope it is clear that someone who has made significant contributions
<br>
to an organization such as The Hunger Project who are really trying
<br>
to address problems such as the sustainable reduction of world hunger
<br>
is as concerned as you with regard to the situation of the people
<br>
in Afghanistan.  We may only differ in our perceptions of the best
<br>
way to achieve this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dealing with and &quot;propping up&quot; are also not necessarily the same thing.
</em><br>
<p>No doubt.  And I suspect if we went through the details of &quot;dealing with&quot;,
<br>
&quot;propping up&quot; and &quot;undermining&quot; we would find examples of U.S. foreign
<br>
policy where each strategy has failed miserably.
<br>
<p>If you have a sure-fire policy that is going to reliably promote
<br>
human survival and increases in quality of life, I'm all ears.
<br>
I suspect we have hundreds, if not thousands of people in the
<br>
Dept. of State who have studied political history much more than
<br>
any of us on the list who can recite chapter and verse those
<br>
situations where the best strategy was &quot;X&quot; and it turned out
<br>
miserably wrong.
