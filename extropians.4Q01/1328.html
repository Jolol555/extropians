I'm sorry, but I think you missed my point.  I saw nothing in your
<br>
reply that addressed it.

<em>&gt; &gt; True.  But you also need to pay the people who design the stuff to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use even a large fraction of the metal in a single asteroid) of it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be brought back down to Earth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are after a near earth asteroid and are using robots
</em><br>
<p>Construction of which was paid for how?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you might not need to snag the rock at all for the beginning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extraction and refining and hollowing out some habitation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space.
</em><br>
<p>Designers of said space paid for how?  (Without at least some design,
<br>
the robots will leave an unstructured, cracked void which would be
<br>
useless - without repairs and remodeling - for habitation.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When the work has preceded for a while and the rock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; returns to its nearest point might be the time to send out a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human team.
</em><br>
<p>Which will be years, probably at least a century or two, later for most
<br>
such rocks.  Humans usually aren't that patient.  This may change in
<br>
a century or two, assuming greatly extended lifespans come into play,
<br>
but I'm talking about strategy to get space colonized *within* a single
<br>
century.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How much is extended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure, material, fuel and habitation already in space worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to would be space enterprise?
</em><br>
<p>Right now?  $0, or close enough to make no difference.  I'm not
<br>
kidding: NASA might well, say, boost its discarded shuttle fuel tanks
<br>
into orbit if someone where to pay it enough; design studies have even
<br>
been done on it.  But no one so far has been willing to pick up the
<br>
tab.  Maybe the ISS will eventually change that, but despite all the
<br>
participants, that is still mainly a NASA project, not very
<br>
international and *definitely* not primarily commercial, when one
<br>
follows the money.
<br>
<p>Develop the market - or at least get launch costs down enough so there
<br>
can *be* a market - and then it'll be worth something.  Until that
<br>
happens, though, history says that no one will pay for such, because
<br>
the rest of what they'd need to do is just so expensive as to make it
<br>
unprofitable.
<br>
<p>The hard fact is: there are very few activities that have been
<br>
identified as more profitable (measured in monetary or any quantifiable
<br>
terms) to do in space than on Earth, given even 10x lower than present
<br>
costs of accessing space.  Asteroid mining, *if one delivers the
<br>
minerals to Earth to sell them*, is one such activity.  Once these
<br>
activities have started up, *then* support activities (such as mining
<br>
asteroids for use in orbit) become worthwhile, but not before (i.e.,
<br>
not now).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Keeping 'em up there becomes more feasable for the later asteroids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But we need to get from here to there before we're there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually I think keeping the materials up there is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasible for the first asteroid or two.  Only ship to Earth high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value minerals that you don't have much pragmatic use for in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbit.
</em><br>
<p>== all minerals of any Earthside value, for the first asteroid or two.
<br>
There *is* no pragmatic use for them in orbit until you get space
<br>
industry going, because until then, there is no one willing to pay the
<br>
costs of obtaining an asteroid unless the minerals will be delivered
<br>
to the ground.
