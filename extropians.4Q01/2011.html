</em><br>
<p>When you start freezing brainwashed people, don't you think brainwashed
<br>
people will start freezing non-brainwashed people too? Or more likely,
<br>
have been doing it for quite some time. After all, westerners have been
<br>
brainwashed by zionist controlled media and a corrupt culture into a
<br>
decadent way of thinking, which is really hard to undo without extreme
<br>
measures or by placing them in contact with a normal, healthy Wahabi
<br>
societies. Hence the humane thing to do, while trying to make the world
<br>
sane and safe for fundamentalist Islam, is to freeze or execute
<br>
brainwashed westerners. 
<br>
<p>See the problem with your reasoning? The fact that some people have bad
<br>
mental software doesn't mean they are without rights, and when you start
<br>
to try to pre-empt their bad behavior by violating their rights they
<br>
will have even more reason to strike at you. There are far better ways
<br>
at pre-empting terrorism.
<br>
<p>Right now many US schools try to pre-empt more shootings by detecting
<br>
&quot;risky&quot; students and expelling them. Does anybody think that will really
<br>
solve the problem of young people with very bad feelings about
<br>
themselves, the world and especially their peers? It does decrease the
<br>
risk for the school doing the expelling a slight bit, but it increases
<br>
the risk to society as a whole. 
<br>
<p>As for how much bad mental software can be undone, I think you are
<br>
unduly negative. There is a huge difference between the frontal lobe
<br>
insufficiency that makes many criminals &quot;incurable&quot; and merely a
<br>
self-reinforcing belief system. Still hard to deal with, and I doubt it
<br>
is workable to &quot;treat&quot; everybody for having the wrong memes (why them
<br>
and not us?), but there are other ways: gain the support from the vast
<br>
majority of moderate, average people for your ideas, and the
<br>
fundamentalists will be &quot;treated&quot; every day in their societies, the less
<br>
hardcore members slowly having their faith eroded and the real hardcore
<br>
members increasingly isolated and with less support.
<br>
<p>I see a danger in that many people have got so scared by the current
<br>
threats that they believe they can solve the threats through some purely
<br>
technological-administrative solution, usually an extremely coercive
<br>
one. But such solutions seldom work practically, and they fail both
<br>
ethically and culturally - in the end I expect them to do much damage
<br>
and worsen the situation. Just look at what is happening to civil
<br>
liberties right now, and think about a similar panic about technology. I
<br>
have seen even otherwise rational transhumanists propose centralized
<br>
control over powerful technologies with little thought about
<br>
accountability, reliability and robustness of the scheme, just
<br>
motivating it by the argument that a disaster could be so bad that it
<br>
allows *any* countermeasures - without thinking of *better*
<br>
countermeasures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So while we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invoke the &quot;rationality&quot; perspective, I really question whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground that concept stands on isn't quite swampy.  It was once rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consider the world was flat or that physical constants never change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We know now the former is wrong and the later is up for serious challenge.
</em><br>
<p>Which is really what rationality is about: the willingness to update
<br>
your world model when new facts arrive, in order to make it fit reality
<br>
better.
