<p><p>The fact that I may construct simulation hardware, create copies

the desired results of the experiment seems moral to me.  I
<br>
suspect that to Anders &amp; Greg this is immoral because my
<br>
equivalent selves obtain equivalent moral actor status the
<br>
second I've started them running.
<br>
<p>It seems that the only logical way out of this is that once
<br>
you discover you are running in a simulation you accept the
<br>
fact that your moral actor rights are subject to the rights
<br>
of the simulation creator.  I.e. the simulation creator's
<br>
moral system supercedes your own.
<br>
<p>### I take the A&amp;G side here, partially - sentient entities, whether copies
<br>
or naturally evolved ones, have rights insofar as they recognize and cherish
<br>
the rights of other entities. If a copy (and by extension the original),
<br>
believes that the existence of a self aware entity may only be terminated if
<br>
the entity agrees to it (without duress), or if the entity is willing to
<br>
disregard a life-wish (=the entity is immoral and therefore has no rights),
<br>
then you may not terminate it. This is an innocent person. However, if your
<br>
copy believes that destroying innocent entities is acceptable, then this
<br>
copy is immoral, and may be terminated. In other words, if you think its
<br>
wrong to kill others, then it's to kill you. If you believe that it's OK to
<br>
kill others, then it's OK for others to kill you. If I made a copy of
<br>
myself, I would be prohibited from killing it, because I (and my copies)
<br>
believe you may not kill innocent others. If you make a copy of yourself, (a
<br>
copy that believes that it is OK to kill copies), then you may kill it. A
<br>
more thorny issue is whether it's OK to kill you, and personally I think it
<br>
would be wrong - since you kill only guilty entities, copies which are
<br>
willing to kill, then you are not any more culpable than a hangman,  who
<br>
kills guilty persons. But then, if a copy escaped and managed to kill you,
<br>
it would be also blameless.  This is based on the old Kantian reciprocity,
<br>
with a little twist to it.
<br>
<p>Of course, if are in a simulation, your ability to enforce your morality
<br>
might be limited but this is a technical, not ethical problem.
