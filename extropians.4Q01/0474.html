Following Anders's lead on linking stuff to Extropianism:  How does Hoppe's
<br>
views -- in <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html</a> and his
<br>
recent book _Democracy: The God that Failed_ -- on government relate to
<br>
Extropianism or, at least, transhumanism?
<br>
<p>Well, they could for or against or some mix.
<br>
<p>I think they are mostly complimentary.  In order to sustain technological
<br>
and cultural progress we need a market like social structure -- one that can
<br>
easily, nonlinearly search the possibility space for new ideas.  (Markets
<br>
are spontaneous orders; ultimately, the kind of libertarianism proposed by
<br>
others and me is based on an equality of authority -- each person being her
<br>
or his own leader -- rather than an equality of some results.)
<br>
<p>A command structure -- the only social alternative; another nonsocial one
<br>
being autarky where there are not social interactions -- would not do this.
<br>
It would centralize all the decision making and limit the search space to
<br>
whatever either the majority as a majority or the leadership could imagine
<br>
or desire.
<br>
<p>Therefore, I think market-like structures -- or social structures that allow
<br>
market interactions -- i.e., individual, voluntary ones -- are more
<br>
Extropian than the alternatives.  This does not mean every society must be
<br>
exactly the same, down to the lowest interaction level.
<br>
<p>Notably, the more free, in terms of individual initiative -- what other type
<br>
of freedom is there? -- a social there is, the more overall progress there
<br>
typically is.  Also, self-transformation and not serving a social order is
<br>
the hallmark of such societies.  (Granted, members of such societies might
<br>
not always choose the right way to do this and most people, sadly, prefer
<br>
confromity, but this is true of all society types.)  Such societies also
<br>
exhibit practical optimism, since the focus of change is usually at the
<br>
microlevel -- not at the level of grand social schemes than absorb and blur
<br>
out individual choice.  All of these are Extropian values, right?
<br>
<p>Now, a society that stifles microlevel change is, in my eyes, less like a
<br>
dynamic society able to support progress.  At best, the command society can
<br>
foster sweeping changes but only top down.  The directions for change are
<br>
limited, and typically many individuals are unable to adjust.  They get left
<br>
out.  Strict majority rule, e.g., does this.  The majority gets its way.  If
<br>
the majority wants pizza, the rest can't choose to have the salad or
<br>
whatever.
<br>
<p>Let me explicate another point.  I think we can all agree that Extropianism
<br>
to be optimally carried out is not compatible with every form of society.
<br>
This is a meta-issue in this debate.  Or do we agree on this?
<br>
<p>I'm not saying Hoppe would totally agree with this -- or that I would
<br>
totally agree with Hoppe.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
