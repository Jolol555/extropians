<em>&gt; &gt;Hypothetically, what if there was a religion (not Islam, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hypothetical religion that doesn't exist at all in our timeline)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;diametrically opposed to the liberal, secular, rational, humanist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;egalitarian values. Would it be acceptable for us to regard this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;religion as a problem rather than as a valid point of view, much like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we regard bigotry and hatred as problems rather than as opinions?
</em><br>
<p>I think most rational folks don't see any difference between religious
<br>
points of view and things like bigotry and racism.  The latter are
<br>
just opinions too, and deserve equal freedom.  A man has just as much
<br>
right to be a bigot as he does to be a Christian.  It is when either
<br>
reaches the level of _action_ that we become concerned.  With religious
<br>
groups, the primary action to be concerned about is legislation.
<br>
<p>It is true that society at large sees it differently; most people
<br>
probably do disapprove of bigotry and approve of religion.  But the
<br>
fact taht society sees it that way doesn't make it rational.
