<br>
<em>&gt; For whatever reason, statistics are routinely abused by the media to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceal important safety facts.  Look at the numbers behind the numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before accepting such myths.  Men drive 2 1/2 times as many miles as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women.
</em><br>
<p>That's because men spend less time on the road, so that makes sense.
<br>
<p>The current analysis (measuring probability by miles-to-accidents)
<br>
is flawed.  Probability ought to be measured as a function of
<br>
time-on-the-road to accidents.  And, men may drive more miles, but
<br>
at a higher speed, and so they spend less actual time on the
<br>
road.
<br>
<p>The reason why I say measuring probability is only meaningful
<br>
as a function of time vs. accidents is because regardless of
<br>
your vehicles speed, the odds of getting into an accident
<br>
are the same (50/50, or 0.50) -- you either do, or you don't.
<br>
So, you really need to break things down into &quot;number of
<br>
accidents per unit time&quot; ... and being that even though women
<br>
drive fewer miles, I'd bet that a large majority of women drivers
<br>
spend their time driving local roads at 25 MPH vs. men who
<br>
are commuting (at 55 MPH-65 MPH, or even 75 MPH and up).  So,
<br>
even if men drive twice the miles of women, 1 hour at 25 MPH
<br>
should be compared equally to 1 hour at 50 MPH ... now factor
<br>
in for that hour of driving, who has more accidents.  Is it
<br>
still the women?  Or men?
<br>
<p>Now, presume that women spend more actual time driving than
<br>
men do.  Use that to normalize the number of accidents.  Who
<br>
has a worse driving record now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you want data on men as better drivers, take a look at the names of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winners of auto races (which are open to anyone with a qualifying lap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time).
</em><br>
<p>Are you really this dumb?  That's like saying &quot;if you want data on
<br>
men as better presidents of the United States, take a look at the
<br>
names of the US presidents to date (which is open to any natural
<br>
born citizen or citizen of the United States that is 35 years and
<br>
has been a resident of the United States for 14 years).&quot;
<br>
<p>Or, it's like saying &quot;women make better ballet dancers, if you want
<br>
proof just look at the number of successful women ballet dancers
<br>
vs. the number of successful men ballet dancers.&quot;
<br>
<p>Do not mistake coincidence for causation.  Really.
<br>

<br>
(You know, for a long time, there were many more successful
<br>
male computer programmers than females.  Did this mean that
<br>
males were better programmers than females?  I don't think
<br>
so.)
