<em>&gt; &gt; I think as Extropians we would support the notion that collective and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-human entities should have rights if they are able to request them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what exactly is meant by &quot;request them&quot; here?  I think it's pretty easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me to understand a request in English from another human.  However, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called collective -- such as the ones you list: &quot;[c]orporations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partnerships, marriages, other groupings&quot; -- them don't usually make such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requests.  Their members do, so they are not truly individuals -- or most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't view them as such, especially since their members can and do act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independently.  For instance, a member of XYZ, Inc. can do stuff that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation itself would be against.  Typically, a human's mouth does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say things it doesn't want to say.  (Yeah, there are exceptional cases, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people don't speak in tongues or have Torette's Syndrome.:)  If they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did, our social context would be radically different.)
</em><br>
<p>People are not all that unified.  They are often of two minds about an
<br>
issue.  Minsky's &quot;Society of Mind&quot; model points out how you can think
<br>
of a human mind as an interacting collection of agents.  And for that
<br>
matter people may find that their bodies betray them.  The spirit is
<br>
willing but the flesh is weak, and all that.
<br>
<p>While it is true that people generally have a greater degree of cohesion
<br>
than most organizations, I think there is likely to be overlap.  That is,
<br>
there are partnerships which are more cohesive and unified in purpose
<br>
than some single individuals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We envision a time when social and mental structures will be much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complex than the simple distinction we have today between individuals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; organizations.  We could have hybrid beings with some of the properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it might be hard for creatures on lower levels to notice this.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, if a collective conscious emerges on the social level, it might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only communicate with other social level consciousnesses.  It might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unaware of its members as you are unaware of your neurons when you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking.  Heck, from a member's vantage point, the member might not even be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware any higher level consciousness exists.  He or she might just react to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his or her context as you and I currently react to our social context.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not talking about something this abstract.  Individuals and
<br>
corporations interact in the same real world.  Similarly people will
<br>
interact with other conscious entities with a wide variety of mental
<br>
structures.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; If two or more people want to hook up their brains and think collectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it should be OK.  If someone wants to subdivide their consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into multiple semi-autonomous parts, that should be permitted as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We should encourage experimentation like this.  It will add diversity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the world and make more opportunities available to everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think anyone was suggesting to disallow this...  However, the rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of such entities is still something that has to be worked out, especially in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regards not just to relations to plain vanilla humans, but in regards to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts or wholes.  For instance, if I could split my mind into several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subpersonalities, would one of them be allowed to do things that might hurt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the others?  If I became part of a collective consciousness, would the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective consciousness trump my individual rights?  This becomes even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important if the new consciousness is emergent and not created by agreement.
</em><br>
<p>One question I have often wondered about is whether our own minds could
<br>
be considered to be violating rights in some sense; for example, our
<br>
cortex overrides the more primitive parts of the brain.  Perhaps from
<br>
a sufficiently enlightened perspective, our internal mental structures
<br>
are immoral.  Future generations may avoid coercive mental architectures.
<br>
<p>These issues become even more apparent and difficult, as you suggest,
<br>
when we consider mental structures where the individual components are
<br>
visible, rather than invisible inside someone's head as they are today.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Also, even ones created by agreement -- such as several of us getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together to form one group mind -- will not be cut and dry.  After all, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not have worked out all the details...  Suppose we (what's left of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;we&quot;:) decide to individuate, but the group mind doesn't want to die?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then?
</em><br>
<p>At some level we could leave it up to the group/individuals to decide.
<br>
The question is whether we outsiders should intervene on behalf of
<br>
one side or the other.  As individuals we might be forgiven for being
<br>
prejudiced and identifying with that side of the struggle.  But the
<br>
other side may have a case as well.
