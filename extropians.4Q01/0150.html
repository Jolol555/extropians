replaced with electrical or natural gas systems.  This approach is

not really feasible on a short term time frame, and because any crisis

<p>### You are quite right pointing out that the change from oil will take many
<br>
years - it's unlikely that there will be a sudden breakdown in the
<br>
production of oil (short of WW III for real). Even if the Middle East were
<br>
to become unstable, there are enough altenative sources to tide the US over,
<br>
although at a steep price. Most likely, as outlined in an article in the
<br>
Scientific American last year (in September, I think), there will be a
<br>
gradual decline in oil production and a slow changeover to other sources of
<br>
energy, which will be effected without the need for government intervention
<br>
(except basic R&amp;D)
