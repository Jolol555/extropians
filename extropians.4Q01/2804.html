I'm sure many of us watched the meteor shower last night.  I was lucky 
<br>
enough to see the beginning part ( at around 1:20 or so) from the top of 
<br>
MIT's great dome, and later saw the most intense part from the roof deck of 
<br>
my from 4:00 to 5:30.  This brings me to something I found a little 
<br>
puzzling.  Near the beginning of the shower, the meteors seemed to be 
<br>
brighter than the ones that came later.  I've come up with a few possible 
<br>
explanations, such as faster traveling comet fragments getting here faster 
<br>
and burning brighter, or the smaller fragments being slowed more by 
<br>
collisions with cisterran dust and the solar wind.  If somebody knows the 
<br>
answer, or even just solar wind density and velocity, along with the 
<br>
velocity of the comet at the time the meteors broke off, I'd be much obliged.
