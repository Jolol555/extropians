From: &quot;Colin Hales&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:colin@versalog.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Sincere%20Questions%20on%20Identity&In-Reply-To=&lt;003a01c183ea$f68ff520$345c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">colin@versalog.com.au</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; In copying you are disconnecting a sentience from it's I/O
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (sensors/actuators), keeping all its memories, copying it, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reconnecting the copy to it's own set of I/O, in a different physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; location. From that instant you have two sentiences on divergent life-paths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course they are not the same. For in-depth analysis of this phenomenon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consult that prodigious journal of wisdom - Red Dwarf, where Rimmer and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy of himself gradually diverge from total sameness to completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different to enemies. All in a half hour show.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you (and Rimmer) for providing the definitive analysis of the Identity
<br>
Question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I asked the list a long time ago if anyone had ever 'graded' sentience. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never got any reply but I grow more concerned that we may need a system of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; licences to control the creation of sentience beyond a certain level. A true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience, that knows that it knows that it knows - replete with experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and values and relationships - should not be allowed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copied/killed/mutated willy nilly.
</em><br>
<p>Then again, what sentience, that knows that it knows that it knows, would take
<br>
it upon itself to dictate which beings should be allowed whatever? The
<br>
ultimate sentience transcends such petty decisions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The life of the sporadic holo-doctor on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Star Trek Voyager is still a life - can you imagine the series without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him/her/ve/whatever?
</em><br>
<p>Of course a fictional story devised for children needs an immature character
<br>
to appeal to viewers. Can you imagine a world in which people fail to grow up,
<br>
so that they continue to need imaginary characters to complete their lives?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a book - SciFi - Robin Cook...can't remember the name?? where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans live multiple serial lives in different bodies. When they've burned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a body they go into a machine. It makes a carbon mesh copy of the brain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they gestate a new body, and grow the new brain with the pattern of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original. Voila....immortality. Or is it?
</em><br>
<p>Sounds somewhat like a parallel to real life, where children inherit the
<br>
genetic procilivities of their parents. Some (square) people think of families
<br>
as a kind of immortality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only thing you can say for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure is that the original human went into the machine quite by choice, happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the knowledge that something good was going to happen. A dead body came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out. The rights of the potential sentience in the new body were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressed in any serious fashion. Nor were the rights of the 'potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continued sentience' of the old body.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds even more like conventional bio-reproduction. Humans have
<br>
rationalized the continuance of themselves through their children since humans
<br>
discovered that children are similar to their parents. The extreme
<br>
techno-extropic position is Hans Moravec's Mind Children, which are very
<br>
different from the parents, yet carry on the tradition of parents making
<br>
children which surpass themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whilst in the machine the sentience could still be 'related to' verbally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although what they replace all the sensory and organ I/O with beats me.
</em><br>
<p>This device of verbal relationship provides the magic element that
<br>
disconnected parent/child evolution lacks. Notice how intensely, almost
<br>
desperately, parents try to communicate with their newborn children.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a weird experience. Imagine all those hormone secretion synapses in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretend neuron mesh trying to 'squirt' non-existent hormones into ...what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I digress.
</em><br>
<p>The digression is worthy of discussion. Hormone computing has only very
<br>
recently emerged as a feasible and potentially very powerful tool for creating
<br>
artificial intelligence.
<br>
<p>Gotta leave now...
<br>
Perhaps we can go into this in more depth later.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:

&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
