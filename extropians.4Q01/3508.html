<em>&gt; Some thoughts on the subject of terrorism, for what it's worth.
</em><br>
snip
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many other Western countries are wealthy, have an extensive industrial and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercial presence overseas, support religious freedoms, democracy, export
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their culture, products and services, yet seem to have much less of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with terrorism than does the U.S.
</em><br>
<p>This is incorrect. No other nation exports its culture and media to the
<br>
level that the US does. I defy you to show any other nation that shows a
<br>
trade surplus in news media, entertainment, and other cultural markets
<br>
to rival that of the US.
<br>
<p>Most nations that have a worldwide brand recognition generally do so for
<br>
less than a handfull of brand names. I defy you to show a list of
<br>
worldwide brand names that is not overwhelmingly dominated by those
<br>
originating in the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1997 it was estimated that roughly 1/3 of all terrorist attacks worldwide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are perpetrated against US targets [1].  This is high considering that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US [unlike other nations targeted for terrorism like Algeria, Turkey, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UK] has no internal civil war or quarrels with its neighbors that spawn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism.
</em><br>
<p>If you had measured this in 1987, you would have seen that the
<br>
overwhelming majority of terrorist attacks occured in western europe.
<br>
Western European nations got tough on terrorism in some cases, and in
<br>
others bribed the foreign powers sponsoring the terrorists to stop
<br>
targeting them (the primary French practice). They put soldiers armed
<br>
with machine guns in many public venues.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, this is ENTIRELY ignoring the record of domestic terrorism
<br>
here in the US by Americans. The above referenced study counts the Ruby
<br>
Ridge, Waco, and Oklahoma City incidents as terrorist attacks (despite
<br>
the fact that the first two were instigated by the government), for
<br>
example. The study also counts many minor incidents of vandalism and
<br>
assault involved in the Sagebrush Rebellion that has been ongoing in the
<br>
western US since the 1970's. It counts attacks by Puerto Rican
<br>
Nationalist groups on police and politicians, as well as anti-war and
<br>
other counterculture groups in the 60's and 70's, Black Panther and
<br>
other minority extremists, attacks by communist led farmers in South
<br>
Korea against US military installations, as well as attacks against US
<br>
military installations in europe by communist groups like the
<br>
Bader-Meinhoff Gang and others.
<br>
<p>Given all of this, it is evident that the vast majority of 'terrorist'
<br>
attacks on or in the US had absolutely nothing to do with its foreign
<br>
policy, but with its domestic policies of various kinds.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think there is good evidence to support the view that terrorists strike at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. because they consider Washington to be at war with them. As the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pentagon's Defense Science Board surmised several years ago, &quot;Historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data show a strong correlation between U.S. involvement in international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations and an increase in terrorist attacks against the United States.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [2]  This view is supported with over 60 examples in the Cato paper &quot;Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. Intervention Overseas Breed Terrorism? The Historical Record&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available online at <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb-050es.html">http://www.cato.org/pubs/fpbriefs/fpb-050es.html</a>.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if some terrorist attacks against the U.S. are a response to &quot;what it is&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than &quot;what it does&quot;, the incidents cataloged in this December 1998
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper suggest that many terrorist attacks can be traced back to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interventionist foreign policy.
</em><br>
<p>Of those that do have to do with US foreign policy, what would you have
<br>
us do? Are you for the abandonment of the jews in Israel? Do you
<br>
actually think that the Palestinians would ever deal fairly with them if
<br>
they were at a strategic disadvantage? Furthermore, do you actually
<br>
think that the presence of terrorist attacks against the US somehow
<br>
indicates that US foreign policy is wrong? People who engage in
<br>
terrorism around the world are generally not nice people, and their
<br>
goals are generally not those which we in the west would find at all
<br>
acceptable (their real goals, not just those they espouse in their
<br>
propaganda).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMHO, terrorism cannot be understood or effectively dealt with in isolation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from American foreign policy. Terrorism is a tactic, and it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually confusing to declare war on a tactic. You can kill individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists, but if the cause of their hatred is our interventionist foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy, more will just take their place.
</em><br>
<p>Declaring war on a tactic is entirely unconfusing. It is saying &quot;If you
<br>
have a greivance, you will not use these methods to address them or get
<br>
attention&quot;. The Laws of War were established for a purpose: to reduce or
<br>
eliminate the abuse and killing of civilians by combatants in conflicts.
<br>
The reason for this purpose is because it has been found that it is far
<br>
easier to keep the peace after war if this is adhered to than if not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What to do now?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joseph Sobran recently remarked that it is a lot easier to avoid falling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into an abyss than to climb out of one. Like other Libertarians he had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warned for decades that our overseas interventions would prove costly. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has proven so. When he was asked what we should do now, he said he felt like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the doctor who warned his patient that smoking could cause cancer. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patient ignored him, smoked heavily, got cancer as a result and then asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the doctor, &quot;ok, you're so smart, what do I do now?&quot; There may be no great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer.
</em><br>
<p>His analogy can also be applied to the Laws of War: it is far easier for
<br>
everyone to follow them than to allow a tit-for-tat descent into a chaos
<br>
of abandoning these principles. The current atmosphere of terrorism
<br>
exists because we have not shown the intestinal fortitude to properly
<br>
punish those who have disregarded them in the past (including ourselves,
<br>
BTW). In this regard, the whiners are right, however their proposed
<br>
solution is not workable.
<br>
<p>However, your counting of domestic terrorism incited by repressive
<br>
domestic policies is entirely disengenuous.
