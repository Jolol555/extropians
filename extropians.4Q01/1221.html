JOSEPH JACOBSON of the M.I.T. Media Lab and E Ink seeks to create the effect
<br>
of real paper that prints itself. His ultimate goal is a cybercodex, &quot;the last
<br>
book,&quot; a bound volume of hundreds of e-ink pages with enough memory chips to
<br>
store the entire contents of the Library of Congress.

<p>The Electronic Paper Chase

<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/2001/1101issue/1101ditlea.html">http://www.scientificamerican.com/2001/1101issue/1101ditlea.html</a>
<br>
OFFERING A GLIMPSE of a future with rewritable periodicals, this E Ink
<br>
Corporation prototype &quot;prints&quot; text using electronic ink. Voltages are
<br>
supplied to the ink by a thin-film-transistor panel, from IBM. The panel is
<br>
800 by 600 pixels; each pixel is formed by charged pigment--the &quot;ink.&quot;
<br>
Electrically erasable programmable memory sticks (sitting atop display, at
<br>
right) are used in setting the text.
<br>
<p>The Last Book
<br>
Almost from the beginning, Jacobson's long-term vision for e-ink has included
<br>
&quot;the last book&quot;: several hundred bound pages of self-printing paper with a
<br>
separate processor imprinted on each page and enough memory chips in the
<br>
hardcover volume's spine to store the entire contents of the Library of
<br>
Congress. With a single page of e-inked paper able to replicate any stored
<br>
page of text, graphics or even video, why bother binding together so many
<br>
pages? According to Jacobson, one reason is to engage a reader's spatial
<br>
memory: thumbing through a book-length work makes it easier to locate a
<br>
particular passage or illustration.
<br>
<p>Somewhere between Jacobson's e-tome and Sheridon's e-scroll, there's another
<br>
format that electronic paper publishing could adopt. This one is an updated
<br>
variation on early printing's folios--binary multiples (8, 16 or 32) of pages
<br>
cut from a single large printed sheet. In 1999 Robert Steinbugler, head of
<br>
IBM's corporate strategic design program, unveiled a design prototype for the
<br>
eNewspaper--a rubberized, flexible, portfolio-style display device containing
<br>
eight two-sided pages made of digital paper (actually plastic mock-ups, for
<br>
now). Based on interviews with newspaper publishers and readers, Steinbugler
<br>
concluded that a sheaf of pages afforded the ability to flip back and forth
<br>
among stories without having to redraw their text, while also offering the
<br>
serendipitous juxtaposition of stories that still distinguishes newspapers in
<br>
print from their online, one-screen-at-a-time versions.
<br>
<p>Given today's accelerated quest for electronic paper, it may not be too long
<br>
before Scientific American readers are offered a choice of e-folio,
<br>
e-hardcover or e-papyrus editions.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
