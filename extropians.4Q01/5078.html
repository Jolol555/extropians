<p><p>The night-blindness comment was not one of the ones I found offensive, and I
<br>
doubt if other women would--except possibly for the context in which it
<br>
appeared--that is to say, along with statements that women drive 25 mph in
<br>
the fast lane while applying their makeup and deliberately run into
<br>
telephone poles. NOTE: I don't remember who made which statements. Not
<br>
holding anything against anyone. Just thought you guys might find a woman's
<br>
perspective useful and might keep it in mind when you're in social
<br>
situations involving women.  I'm not suggesting being phony, just that you
<br>
consider what you're saying and speak of women (and all people, for that
<br>
matter) respectfully as individuals.
