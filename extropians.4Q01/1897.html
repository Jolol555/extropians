<p>No, John, it isn't. It's far cheaper and economically stimulating than a
<br>
missile defense system, for those facilities can be used for other
<br>
purposes, even as one's primary dwelling, though the establishment of
<br>
such large inventories of consumables would likely cause business cycles
<br>
to become exacerbated, as families would turn to their stockpiles in
<br>
downturns and thus reduce consumer spending at a time when it is needed
<br>
most.
<br>
<p>One could posit that the whole 'just in time' inventory philosophy is
<br>
mostly responsible for the relative tempering of economic downturns in
<br>
recent decades. Consumers have always operated in such a manner in
<br>
respect to needed consumables. Few people today stockpile food and other
<br>
supplies like many who survived the Great Depression. Those that do
<br>
generally do so in a far more perishable condition (frozen foods) than
<br>
previously used (canned, dried, etc).
<br>
<p>On a related note, last night I watched the broadcast of the movie
<br>
&quot;Blast From the Past&quot; (1997), about a family who spent the last 35 years
<br>
cooped up in their bomb shelter after a jet plane crashed on their house
<br>
during the Cuban missile crisis, and their son's attempts to get along
<br>
in the modern world as a 35 year old virgin living on 1950's points of
<br>
view and education in modern day Los Angeles. Pretty funny (nothing like
<br>
Monty Python there, but still good).
