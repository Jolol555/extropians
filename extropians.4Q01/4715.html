<p>Huh?  I *hate* to tell you this but electricity and telephones are the
<br>
last things people in the 3rd world need to improve their lives.  Equality
<br>
between women and men, access to credit, supportive educational systems
<br>
and rule of law (not dictators or warlords) is what 3rd world contries
<br>
need.  (I base this on 20 years of reading the literature supplied by
<br>
The Hunger Project (www.thp.org) who have worked in the trenches of 3rd
<br>
world countries trying to provide people with the necessities of life.)
<br>
<p>I'd have to side with Lee -- a free press, or perhaps free and open
<br>
access television (groups of people can watch satellite TV powered by
<br>
solar cells, pedal generators, etc.) is perhaps the best way to
<br>
get the things they *really* need (education, knowledge of funding
<br>
sources, debate about political corruption, etc.).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in fact in many respects one can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the seeds of the economic, humanitarian, religious &amp; military situation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan in the foreign policy of the US, Pakistan &amp; the USSR,
</em><br>
<p>The current situation in Afghanistan follows directly from the cold war.
<br>
Russia wanting to expand its sphere of influence and the U.S. trying to
<br>
prevent that.  Whether the current Afghan situation is &quot;good&quot; depends
<br>
on how you balance it against the progress of democracy in Eastern Europe
<br>
and Russia over the last decade.  Could we have done a better job?
<br>
Most probably.  But as they say hindsight is 20-20.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The propping up of mad dictators &amp; inhumane juntas MUST stop.
</em><br>
<p>So should we bomb Uzbekistan and Tajikistan into rubble as well while
<br>
we are at it?  Or would you prefer that we not have bases from which
<br>
military rescue operations can be conducted while the U.S. tries to
<br>
cleanup the mess in Afghanistan?  I'll note that it is *highly*
<br>
unlikely the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan Friendship Bridge would now be
<br>
open (supplying food to people facing starvation) had the U.S.
<br>
taken a &quot;hands off&quot; policy with regard to Afghanistan or not
<br>
gotten its hands &quot;dirty&quot; by dealing with Uzbekistan politicians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The exploitation of foreign workers and ecologies for the profit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a few rich shareholders MUST stop.
</em><br>
<p>I'll simply note that the reason that we lost interest in Afghanistan
<br>
after the Soviets left is precisely because there are no American
<br>
interests there (in contrast to say Saudi Arabia).  I think if you
<br>
look at the economies of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, etc. it seems
<br>
difficult to make the case that &quot;exploiting&quot; foreign workers has
<br>
caused them to remain mired in poverty.
<br>
<p>I agree with much of remainder of what you said but would like to
<br>
close with a couple of thoughts.
<br>
<p>When Russia was mired in its economic pit in the mid-'90's and
<br>
many people were calling on the U.S. to &quot;help&quot; Russia, President
<br>
Clinton made a statement to the effect of, &quot;The United States cannot
<br>
help Russia -- only Russia can help Russia&quot;.  The same is true of
<br>
*all* countries.  The U.S. cannot &quot;magically&quot; make them work.
<br>
<p>Historically we have had the &quot;guns vs. butter&quot; economic tradeoffs.
<br>
Now its more like &quot;defense vs. domestic &amp; international welfare vs.
<br>
R&amp;D (NSF, NIH, the Advanced Technologies Program, etc.).  I tried
<br>
to make a utilitarian argument about the value of future lives
<br>
saved vs. present day lives lost once previously on the list and
<br>
got crucified for it.  It failed because it required the use of
<br>
active force and because of the uncertainty of how to value
<br>
past and future lives.  But one can eliminate the &quot;active force&quot;
<br>
part of the equation and the debate becomes &quot;domestic defense&quot;
<br>
(e.g. more emergency response teams) vs. domestic &amp; international
<br>
welfare (health care, education, Peace Corps, etc.) &amp; R&amp;D
<br>
(anthrax anti-toxins, stem cells, etc.)
<br>
<p>I think there will be a point where spending every penny one has
<br>
on R&amp;D will maximize the number of individuals that survive
<br>
through the singularity.  I also think there will be a different
<br>
point in time when you may be able to &quot;mortgage the future&quot;
<br>
(as Regan did) under the &quot;prevailing&quot; market conditions -- and allocate
<br>
large amounts of money to all 3 of the above tradeoffs (perhaps
<br>
salvaging even more people).  This may be feasible because the
<br>
singularity will bail you out just as the productivity improvements
<br>
of the '90's (and perhaps social security) bailed out Regan's gambit.
<br>
<p>However it is going to require a much clearer crystal ball than
<br>
mine to predict precisely *when* those points in time will be.
<br>
We might already be past them.  But I don't have that much
<br>
hindsight yet.
