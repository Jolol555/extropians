<em>&gt; I don't understand how a quantum computer can work, but I read a little

<em>&gt; time back that it can do multiple calculations simulataneously. That is, if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have 2 qubits they can perform 4 calculations at once by simultaneously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiencing (in some way I can't begin to understand) all possible state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combinations at once. Similarly that 3 qubits &quot;feel out&quot; 8 states, 4 qubits 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 16 states, and so on.
</em><br>
<p>Don't forget, with an ordinary computer 3 bits can hold any one
<br>
of 8 states, four bits can hold any one of 16 states, and so on.
<br>
The difference with the QC is that it can operate on multiple states
<br>
simultaneously.  You can put your 3 bits into all 8 possible states
<br>
at the same time, and then perform some operation on each of these 8
<br>
possible states, ending up in a superposition of all 8 possible results.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would be a pretty impressive computer if I have that right. Would that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it possible to handle all the computations of all the neurons (10^12) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and synapses (perhaps 10^3 per neuron) of the brain even taking into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account about 1,000 levels of exciteability for each synapse... with just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 60 qubits!!?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That can't be right... can it?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it is quite right.  Accepting your figures, you don't just
<br>
multiple 10^12 times 10^3 times 10^3 to get the number of possible brain
<br>
states, and then take the log base 2 to get the number of qubits needed.
<br>
<p>Rather, to represent a single synapse state you would need 10 bits for
<br>
10^3 possible states.  Then you would need to replicate those 10 bits,
<br>
10^15 times.  So the total number of bits needed to represent a single
<br>
brain state is 10^16, not 60.
<br>
<p>If you had a QC with 10^16 qubits, it could represent all possible
<br>
brain states at once.  So it could in principle simulate all possible
<br>
brain experiences with one calculation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It must require at least one qubit to store an item of information, even if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculations can be made in different ways simultaneously on that one bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of info, it is still just one bit.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is a better instinct.  You can have quantum parallelism but
<br>
you still need enough qubits to represent the individual information
<br>
units that you are operating on in parallel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if each bit can be a single atom (one day in the future) that still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes a tiny human mind -- using 10^18 atoms for storage. The entire mind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be that small of course because you still need some way to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shuttle the info around inside it, but even if the the means of moving data 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around required 100,000 atoms for each storage atom the entire thing is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still just a sixth of a mole of material! If the &quot;brain&quot; used 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanostructures of pure carbon for instance then that would be a device 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weighing just 2 grams (Avogadro's constant puts 6*10^23 atoms of carbon at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12 grams).
</em><br>
<p>This reminds me of Robin Hanson's &quot;Lilliputian Uploads&quot;.  Robin used
<br>
similar reasoning to compute that the brain could be miniaturized to just
<br>
about fit someone who was 1/4 inch tall.  Also, the degree of speedup
<br>
due to the nanotech brain could be matched to the mechanical speedups
<br>
appropriate to a being of this size.  I can't find the full article but
<br>
Robin has a short essay at <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/lilliput.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/lilliput.html</a>.
