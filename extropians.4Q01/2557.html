<p><em>&gt;From: Amara Graps &lt;<a href="mailto:amara@amara.com?Subject=Re:%20Pardon%20my%20rant,%20(was%20Re:%20Afghanistan%20after%20the%20war)&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b815b14365a7@[213.6.50.146]&gt;">amara@amara.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Let them tell you. The Afghans are a fiercely independent, proud
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;people, with a rich history going back centuries, with deep inner
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;lives, with the last one or two hundred years tied strongly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;their land. The binding of that culture is their language and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;combination of the above.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The people of Afghanistan are a whole series of tribes
</em><br>
<p>A loose collection of perhaps half-dozen associated groups who
<br>
love wild open spaces and have a close affinity with their land, who
<br>
in the past had a long tradition of song, art, poetry and a deeply
<br>
mystical life. They were in the middle of an intellectual emergence
<br>
when the Soviets invaded. At that time, the different Muslims (Shia
<br>
and Sunni) cooperated, their brand of Islam was very moderate, women
<br>
were going to universities and 'unveiled', wearing  western dress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;with a long history of fighting with each other as tribes will do. The only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time they are known to unite is to fight outsiders.
</em><br>
<p>It might be hard to say _now_ who the Afghans are because at least
<br>
1/2 of them are dead or in exile: murdered by the Soviets between
<br>
1979 and about 1985 and later by whoever else. That was about one
<br>
million Afghans killed. Or was it two million? three million? Nobody
<br>
knows for sure. In the mid 1980s, the largest refugee population in
<br>
the world were Afghans: Many millions over the world from the four
<br>
million refugees in Pakistan, a couple of million in Iran, hundreds
<br>
of thousands in London, Paris, Canada, the USA, Austrailia. A
<br>
newly-emerging intellectual class disappeared into the Soviet jails
<br>
in 1979 and were not heard from again. Beautiful, ancient towns full
<br>
of art treasures bombed flat. There is not much left of the country
<br>
any more.
<br>
<p>The Afghans call the Soviet 1979 Invasion: &quot;The Catastrophe&quot;.
<br>
I wonder why.
