<em>&gt; I'm going to propose a heresy -- and probably get myself dragged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the coals for it -- but nothing ventured, nothing gained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am going to propose that &quot;information&quot; should not be free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is based on the idea that if you are insufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educated with regard to the information you cannot properly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluate its significance and use it responsibly (extropically).
</em><br>
<p>Knowledge leeds to knowledge, Ignorance leeds...yada yada.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things I now know about in some depth are a result of trying to 
<br>
understand information about something I knew nothing about. If your proposed 
<br>
rule applied, I would have no knowledge of these subjects, because my 
<br>
original exposure to them would not be allowed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, for example, a limited knowledge of molecular biology, genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering, etc. has given a large number of people an axe to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grind against AgBio companies.  As recent experiments have shown,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Monarchs do not seem to be at risk from GM crops.  No significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ill effects have been demonstrated for GM crops.  And yet it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely that people will continue to purchase &quot;organic&quot; crops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disproportionately to any benefit that they can reasonably expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to receive from them.  I.e. people can be &quot;programmed&quot; to behave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrationally (events of the last month being a possible case in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point).
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think that limited knowledge is wholly to blame in cases such 
<br>
as this. I would tend to say that lack of inteligence and people not finding 
<br>
out the facts for themselves are slightly more to blame. Also good ole 
<br>
fashion peer pressure plays a part, be it &quot;My mate BOB says....&quot; or even 
<br>
media coverage, which is the greatest peer pressure in the world.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the real facts and information was not available to the ignorants, 
<br>
then they could never learn the truth.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To take two recent Extropian topics --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Aging isn't a disease&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    -- Do we have any question that Laura Bradbard from the FDA has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       done the extensive survey that Robert Freitas has done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       to begin a rational classification of what &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       a &quot;disease&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Fwd: Secrecy foe scrubs data on Internet&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    -- Do we have any evidence that any potential terrorists have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       not already obtained the information on these sites (in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       case scrubbing it is pointless) or that scrubbing it will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       likely to increase security? (It may decrease it since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       scrubbing may not allow members of the general public to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       what potential targets may exist and exercise a right to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       proximity to such targets).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not claim to be a security expert or to understand the details
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the U.S. security system.  However my general impression is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it operates on the basis of a &quot;need-to-know&quot; and &quot;trustability&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should the knowledge to manufacture chemical weapons or biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons be available to those who would use them unextropically?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the concept developed in the Aristoi -- that one had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to develop the skills to use knowledge productively and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust relationships that you would use such skills in an extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion are worthy of consideration.  I do not believe we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully dealt with the issue of when &quot;freedom&quot; is extropic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g. from Extropian Principles 3.0, Section 5, &quot;Open Society&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;freedom of speech, freedom of action, freedom of experimentation&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runs directly up against, Section 6, &quot;Self-Direction&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;independent thinking, indepdendent freedom, personal responsibility&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have the freedom to speak for the destruction of a people?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, as they have the freedom to speak of your destruction. The act is 
<br>
not Extropic, but the principle is.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Do you have the right to act towards such a goal?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm, this would infringe the rights of others. On the other hand, if 
<br>
it were in the interests of the whole of humanity to do so then it could be 
<br>
justified to an extent. It purely depends on the specifics of the situation. 
<br>
A very grey area.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Should &quot;independent thinking&quot; be promoted if it is &quot;irrational&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (violating principle 7)?  &quot;Remaining open to challenges to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs and practices&quot; seems to leave open the door to people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being willing to sacrifice their lives to challenge your beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and practices.
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also give them the right to explore all avenues of thought in the 
<br>
search for the right path. It will always be the case that a few will take 
<br>
the wrong route thinking it is correct.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe all beliefs should be open to challenge, just in case they 
<br>
are wrong. if this wasn't the case, we would all still live on a flat Earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a fundamental question for me -- on the one hand I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly like the information to be available to overthrow an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppressive government dedicated to limiting my freedoms.  At the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time I am reluctant to adapt a position that makes such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information available to people (essentially &quot;other tribes&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would like to use it not only to destroy my security shield
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but *my* way of thinking entirely (be it *either* a U.S. self-preservation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or an extropic maximization of information content perspective).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, here is the question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should access to information be based on accreditation?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not on your nelly.
