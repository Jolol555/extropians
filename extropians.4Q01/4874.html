</em><br>
<p>You misread my earlier post (Notice that I didn't call you a fool
<br>
either? It takes a lot more than that for me to say something like that,
<br>
and you've got a long way to go). I specifically wrote earlier that the
<br>
Geneva Conventions SPECIFICALLY allow the detention of ALL foreign
<br>
nationals who are citizens of countries from which attacks on the US
<br>
have been launched, supported, funded, or based. Given that OBL and his
<br>
followers are based in many different countries (Sudan, Somalia, Iraq,
<br>
Saudi, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Phillipines, etc), we are fully
<br>
allowed BY INTERNATIONAL LAW to detain and filter any and all citizens
<br>
of those countries. We are required to house and feed them to standards
<br>
established under the Conventions and overseen by the International Red
<br>
Cross for the duration of the conflict, although we can, if we choose,
<br>
release individuals that we determine to be non-threats as we choose,
<br>
but any individuals who are found to be suspected of being illegal
<br>
combatants can be separated from the general population.
<br>
<p>Under the Geneva Conventions, illegal combatants are completely
<br>
unprotected. They can be summarily executed or interrogated. Spies, for
<br>
example, are illegal combatants who have in many cases been summarily
<br>
executed, or executed after being heavily interrogated. Illegal
<br>
combatants do not have ANY rights under the UN Universal Proclaimation
<br>
of Human Rights. For example, when turncoat Aldrich Ames sold out to the
<br>
Soviet Union, the information he provided to the KGB resulted in the
<br>
arrest of 12 'illegals' who were executed, and this result is entirely
<br>
permitted under the Geneva Conventions. The US has traditionally held
<br>
itself to a far higher standard than that spelled out in the GCs,
<br>
primarily because it has found it more profitable to hold spies it has
<br>
caught in prison in order to exchange them with opponents when our own
<br>
spies have been caught.
<br>
<p>Now, the US is being far more gracious than is actually required as a
<br>
minimum by the Geneva Conventions. In Afghanistan, Afghan and al Qaeda
<br>
prisoners are not tortured in any way by US forces, no drugs, no
<br>
physical force is used. In this instance, prisoners who have been fully
<br>
expecting to be executed are far more willing to talk when faced with
<br>
such tender and respectful treatment (these are apparently low ranking
<br>
types though. Upper rankers are being far more reticent, it seems).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They came for the Japanese and noone complained.  We learned.  When they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came for the Arabs, there was a big uproar.  Not that they couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detain them, but they had to be careful.  There are a lot of people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think they aren't being careful enough.  Not many would argue that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police investigation and the questioning shouldn't be done, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want our government to learn from past bad examples and respect people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights.  We don't know which of them are innocent, so we should be real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; careful to treat them all as if they probably are until there's good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, it is entirely because of this attitude that the 911 attacks
<br>
were able to occur. We had Moussawi in jail for a month before the
<br>
attacks, with him refusing to talk. If we were able to interrogate him
<br>
further, then over 3,000 lives would have been saved. How many lives are
<br>
such rights worth, especially in the case of people who are not even
<br>
citizens?
<br>
<p>Outside of OBL and al Qaeda, the rest of the blame for 9-11 falls
<br>
squarely on the shoulders of the ACLU and their ilk.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the actual terrorists who were on airplanes, it didn't take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigators long to come up with reasonable evidence that they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected to Al Quaeda.  Anyone that they couldn't come up with similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence on in a similar period, they should be treating with kid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gloves, and that doesn't seem to be happening.
</em><br>
<p>You don't know that. You have absolutely no idea how prisoners are being
<br>
treated in detention. Most people questioned have simply been mailed
<br>
letters asking them to come in for an interview.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [...]  The Japanase government has never apologized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for this treatment, generally denies that it took place in their history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; books, and has never paid a dime to the survivors or their families,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a different problem from the actions of our government in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depriving citizens of their rights, and I have no problem with those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focus on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and our government prevents our citizens from suing the Japanese over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that this is wrong.  I shouldn't have to complain about either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these wrongs in order to complain when our government throws citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or others who should be presumed innocent, my my reasoning) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detention camps, and confiscates their belongings.
</em><br>
<p>You can consider what the US did wrong. Under the Geneva Conventions, at
<br>
least SOME of those detained were detained legally. Natural born
<br>
citizens of Japanese decent were not proper detainees, and IMHO their
<br>
detention was wrong. Detention of Japanese immigrants was not wrong
<br>
under the Geneva Conventions. If you think that such detention is wrong,
<br>
then you need to lobby to amend the Conventions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that the Japanese (were/may have been) worse isn't a defense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US government's actions.
</em><br>
<p>Especially when it's time to blame the US for nuking the Japanese...
