Amara wrote (in response to my citing the Lionel Tiger article):
<br>
<em>&gt; This article set off my &quot;DANGER: Huge-bias&quot; Detector. He's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropologist ... *of course* there's a scientific theory for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Western) newspaper (of which, gives always highly accurate information..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; err...) so that the article is &quot;credible&quot; for the readers ...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The article so biased, that it's almost a cliche.
</em><br>
<p>Amara, as you probably know I tend to favor &quot;nature&quot; over &quot;nurture&quot;
<br>
unless there is a very large amount of well-intended &quot;nurture&quot; to
<br>
overcome the &quot;nature&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, yes, I know that anthropologists have been called into question
<br>
over some of their methods and assumptions over the last decade.
<br>
But that doesn't erase the fundamental issues -- by and large
<br>
men start wars, not women.  By and large it is for power that
<br>
they do this.  I know of no point for accumulating power unless
<br>
it is some misdirected survival instinct.  Since we currently know,
<br>
unless technologies change, survival is inherently limited and the only
<br>
rational (genetic) outlet for that instinct is reproduction it seems
<br>
logical that males would be willing to risk survival (in war) for
<br>
reproductive opportunities.  Now the *wierd* thing about Islamic
<br>
fundamentalism is that it seems the reproductive opportunities
<br>
are being promised in the afterlife rather than this life.
<br>
<p>While I question the numbers of women who may be monopolized by
<br>
wealthy Arabs (Suadis skimming from the state treasury) which
<br>
would trickle down to contribute to a shortage of potential mates
<br>
for the average Arab on the street -- I do not doubt the problem of
<br>
the Arab &quot;baby boom&quot; producing large numbers of Arab males in the
<br>
15-30 yr. age group resulting in a large population of unemployed
<br>
males who are inherently &quot;undesirable&quot; to women seeking a mate that
<br>
can support a family.  
<br>
<p>You can challenge the article on:
<br>
a) There is no Arab &quot;baby boom&quot;.
<br>
b) There is no unemployment problem in Islamic nations.
<br>
c) Young Arab women are likely to marry young unemployed Arab men.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps other criteria I'm unable to imagine at present.
<br>
You should make your objections clear with regard to concrete
<br>
falures of the article -- not simply claiming it is &quot;so biased&quot;.
<br>
<p>Everything I have read seems to indicate that there is
<br>
a pool of perhaps 50+ million young Arab males whose prospects
<br>
for a family life are rather poor and who can be indoctrinated
<br>
into channeling basic instincts into violent channels.  If you
<br>
can make the case that that statement is inaccurate, then please
<br>
do so.  In addition to this situation there seem to be cases where
<br>
wealthy Arabs are being extorted into, or even &quot;rationally&quot; in their minds
<br>
willingly, providing financial support for the export of terrorism.
<br>
<p>Natural drives combined with indoctrination at a young age
<br>
combined with financial means.  This is not something to be
<br>
taken lightly.  And the fact that it has been occurring for
<br>
the last 20+ years and is becoming increasingly sophisticated
<br>
argues it is not going to go away anytime soon.
<br>
<p>If we do not understand the trends and underlying motivations
<br>
that are producing this situation then we will fail to adequately
<br>
prepare for and respond to it.
<br>
<p>Robert
