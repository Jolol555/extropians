<em>&gt; It probably would be worth allowing adults who want to accept the

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; outbreak.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's an automajic filter that those who have been previously
<br>
immunized won't have adverse reactions to being immunized. Simply doing
<br>
that should go a long way to help reduce any outbreak velocity to
<br>
managable levels. Essentially everybody over 30 has been previously
<br>
immunized, and that makes up over half the population, so rather than a
<br>
pool density of 280 million people, you get it closer to 140 million
<br>
without expensive tests. 
<br>
<p>Then you've got kids who breast fed in the last 30 years, and thus
<br>
inherited some antibodies from mommy. Do they experience the negative
<br>
reactions at the same level as kids who were not breast fed?
