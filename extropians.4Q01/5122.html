</em><br>
<p>The crucial bit of info you're missing is this: You can buy a liter of milk
<br>
in Melbourne for something like A$1.25 (the Aussies on the list can correct
<br>
me if I've got the numbers wrong--but I know they're in the ball park). You
<br>
can rent an apartment for under A$1000 per month. You can buy a new car for
<br>
under A$20,000.  And so forth.
<br>
<p>So a person could afford to live a lifestyle in Melbourne for, say,
<br>
US$60,000 that would cost more like $US115,000 in the US. And people are not
<br>
poorer there. Overall, I'd say the standard of living is higher in Australia
<br>
than in the US, especially for people at the lower end of the scale.
