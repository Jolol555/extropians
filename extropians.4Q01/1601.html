<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So it's a little too soon to assume that the music
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; industry as we know it is a corpse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; While this author's explanations aren't very rigorous (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is to be expected for public-consumption prose), the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; facts are hard to avoid.  Any industry that currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; _relies_ on the excludability of content is on its deathbed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Encryption may provide a few last gasps, but it cannot solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the basic problem (for those who see it as a problem :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think obscurity is a better bet than encryption.  Music and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other linear media are very easily captured and any attempts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at anti-piracy will inevitably fail.  It only takes one kid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working at a music store who has the technical know-how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redistribute all the newest releases throughout the Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This already happens with software.  However, after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illicit copies are out there, the average music buyer needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be aware of them and be able to download them.  At the moment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's easier to get music from a P2P application than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate source, this needn't be the case.  With micro-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payments it should be possible to not only sell legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digital copies but pay commission for referrals, just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amazon does with its affiliates program, thus giving an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentive to websites to refer people to legitimate retailers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ultimately, the entire experience - from discovering a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artist, to finding the particularly song you want, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchasing it - will be controlled by a string of cooperating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middlemen.  The Internet gives far greater control over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole process of promoting and selling an artist; it shouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be too hard to make sure that the majority of consumers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both unaware of illicit methods of obtaining digital media and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would prefer the &quot;genuine&quot; version anyway.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, exactly.  That is indeed one of the business models of
<br>
the age of free content.  And there are many more...
