<em>&gt; While this author's explanations aren't very rigorous (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to be expected for public-consumption prose), the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts are hard to avoid.  Any industry that currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _relies_ on the excludability of content is on its deathbed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Encryption may provide a few last gasps, but it cannot solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basic problem (for those who see it as a problem :-)
</em><br>
<p>I think obscurity is a better bet than encryption.  Music and
<br>
other linear media are very easily captured and any attempts
<br>
at anti-piracy will inevitably fail.  It only takes one kid
<br>
working at a music store who has the technical know-how to
<br>
redistribute all the newest releases throughout the Internet.
<br>
This already happens with software.  However, after the
<br>
illicit copies are out there, the average music buyer needs to
<br>
be aware of them and be able to download them.  At the moment
<br>
it's easier to get music from a P2P application than a
<br>
legitimate source, this needn't be the case.  With micro-
<br>
payments it should be possible to not only sell legitimate
<br>
digital copies but pay commission for referrals, just as
<br>
Amazon does with its affiliates program, thus giving an
<br>
incentive to websites to refer people to legitimate retailers.
<br>
Ultimately, the entire experience - from discovering a new
<br>
artist, to finding the particularly song you want, to
<br>
purchasing it - will be controlled by a string of cooperating
<br>
middlemen.  The Internet gives far greater control over the
<br>
whole process of promoting and selling an artist; it shouldn't
<br>
be too hard to make sure that the majority of consumers are
<br>
both unaware of illicit methods of obtaining digital media and
<br>
would prefer the &quot;genuine&quot; version anyway.
