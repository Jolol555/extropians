<p>Frankly I don't see the difference. I must be completely missing the

</em><br>
<p>I have read it, but it frankly makes no sense in this situation. Some of
<br>
the flaws:
<br>
<p>The theory that by darwinian reasoning we can show that open societies have
<br>
won does not apply to future existential risks scenarios such as open-
<br>
developed nanotech that is cheaply reproducible by all. In fact the paper
<br>
says so: &quot;This paper is concerned with the impact of secrecy vs. openness
<br>
policy on the development of military technology in a long duration peacetime
<br>
rivalry.&quot; The cold war is not applicable here.
<br>
<p>Complaints that secret research tends to lead to unexplored avenues and
<br>
lack of free thinking is not a sufficient reason to allow open development
<br>
of nanotech. If the case for open development can be made that shows it
<br>
can be done safely, then and only then will it be ok to do so. If you can't
<br>
do it safely openly, and doing it closed makes it even worse, then the
<br>
only answer is don't do it at all.
<br>
<p>Note that the author of the paper does not advocate openness for all things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What exactly is your scenario for where terrorists have drextech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yet don't cause severe worldwide damage? A nanotech immune system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And what happens when they come up with a worm that breaches the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defenses? Humans have already proven themselves incapable of devising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a system that would prevent such disasters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly what systems have been tried and failed? You make it sound like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people have tried to build immune systems forever. In reality, what we
</em><br>
<p>Well they basically have- I'm talking about something relatively simple
<br>
compared to building nanotech immune systems: computer security. Only
<br>
the problem with nanotech is you have to get it right from the very
<br>
start- you don't get 30 years to fool around. Accelerating the date at
<br>
which the technology is available to &quot;threats&quot; only makes the problem
<br>
more likely to occur as far as I can see.
<br>
<p>Have you read &quot;Bloom&quot; by Wil McCarthy?
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345408578/">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345408578/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; need is different kinds of defenses against different threats,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overlapping and evolving to match the pace of what people invent or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine. It seems very likely that people would spend a sizeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment on immune systems, institutions controlling nano use and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various other methods of limiting risk, and the collective investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be far larger than any investment in coming up with malicious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotech.
</em><br>
<p>The problem seems to me: isn't it only possible to really work on and
<br>
test nanotech defenses /after/ nanotech itself is &quot;invented&quot;? And if
<br>
it is invented openly and the &quot;recipe&quot; is known by all, then the bad
<br>
guys are going to have a wide open hole of multiple years with which
<br>
to do bad things while the defenses are still being set up.
<br>
<p>Or are you proposing no assemblers be openly released until we have
<br>
thought up every possible offensive use and defense? You'll be waiting
<br>
a long time...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be useful if we could estimate how dangerous a dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person with nanotech is - and when? You have to estimate not just his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offensive capabilities, but also how dangerous they are compared to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defenses of society around him. Quite a few of the nano-scare debates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to lack this kind of analysis.
</em><br>
<p>See above. From what I see, in an open development process, the dangerous
<br>
person can utilize the technology for their purposes as soon as it is
<br>
technically feasible for them to do so, which will only be determined
<br>
by their research environment (budget, available complementary tech, etc.).
<br>
If there are not foolproof defenses in place before then, then the whole
<br>
notion of open development makes no sense. You have to convince me that
<br>
somehow (unlike the Internet/computing example) the defenses will always
<br>
be one or more steps ahead of the offense instead of the reverse.
<br>
<p>The first Net worm occurred well before the Net became very widespread- in
<br>
fact you could say it was during the period that the Net was still being
<br>
created and researched. So apparently you can't trust that the academics
<br>
and others with access to it at that stage will all be good. Will the same
<br>
thing happen with nanotech?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why fool around with such a possibility when leaving the nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; carefully centralized would probably still allow for 90% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; usefulness? Do I really need a home assembler? What for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because centralization means that somebody has more control over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nano than you have. Who do you trust with it? As I said, governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a bad history of that. This is why we need oversight and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accountability, and not just put all the responsibility at one group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I would trust the USA government with it more than leaving it open for
<br>
terrorists to use. I don't mind paying an extra $10 for my nanocomputer
<br>
to be fedexed to me. What I care more about is surviving to be able to
<br>
use it. If you feel that the USA could not be left to develop it in
<br>
a carefully controlled fashion like they did with nukes, then perhaps
<br>
this really is so dangerous it should just be left alone?
