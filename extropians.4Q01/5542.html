<em>&gt;From: Neil Blanch &lt;<a href="mailto:neilb@nswcc.org.au?Subject=Re:%20Aid%20for%20Afghanistan&In-Reply-To=&lt;200112311637.IAA14668@well.com&gt;">neilb@nswcc.org.au</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Brian - to be frank your comments disturb me in their arrogance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The USA is dropping bombs on these people for god's sake! 
</em><br>
<p>The U.S. is dropping bombs on portions of their country because
<br>
terrorists trained in their country and with the support of their
<br>
acting government, murdered thousands of Americans.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The USA is at least partly responsible for the rise of the Taliban
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to power. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Nonsense. The Taliban did not even exist when we funded rebel
<br>
groups in Afghanistan to oppose the Soviet invasion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The USA helped create, train &amp; directly funded, elements in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Afghanistan that are at least partly responsible for the terrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years of war &amp; bloodshed that the country has endured.
</em><br>
<p><p>The U.S. supported groups defending against the Soviet invasion. It
<br>
was after the Soviets left that they started fighting amongst
<br>
themselves for control. Something they have always done.
<br>
<p>This hardly makes us responsible, try sticking to the facts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; How many Afghanis have died as a direct result of American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;policies? Should the people of Afghanistan say &quot;Well the US fucked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us over for the last twenty years, they helped psychotic religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nuts become our government by giving them guns &amp; missiles, they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bombed the crap out of us day &amp; night for the last few months,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they killed twenty people in my village by mistake last week, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now they just gave me a bag of wheat so now USA is A-OK&quot;. Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really expect twenty odd years of utter bastardry to be just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forgotten, just because NOW you've decided to act with SOME
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decency? 
</em><br>
<p>You have your facts all wrong pal.
<br>
<p>The U.S. gave nothing to the Taliban, and therfore did not fuck
<br>
anyone over in Afghanistan for the last twenty years.
<br>
<p>The reason U.S. bombs are dropping is because terrorists trained
<br>
there with the support of the government murdered thousands of
<br>
Americans.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There are people in this world who hate America &amp; America has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;given them plenty of good reasons to have that hate. 
</em><br>
<p><p>A matter of opinion, an opinion we don't share.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If you truly want the US to be safe then the US must act
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsibly. It must stop its political &amp; military support of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorists (sorry, they're &quot;freedom fighters&quot; - at least they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until they start bombing YOU) against legitimate elected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;governments. 
</em><br>
<p>Be specific. You're claiming the Soviets were the legitimately
<br>
elected government of Afghanistan? 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It must stop its support of governments &amp; dictators that torture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&amp; kill &amp; rob their own citizens. It must stop putting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well-being of its business &amp; military interests above the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human rights of other people, regardless of their citizenship. 
</em><br>
<p>Name a government we support that does these things. I mean now,
<br>
today. We have a saying in this country about &quot;glass houses&quot;, you
<br>
might want to look it up, and then at the current policies of your
<br>
own country by the way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It will not be more security that will prevent more terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attacks. It will not be the death of every Al Quada member that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prevents more terrorist attacks. 
</em><br>
<p>Side bet?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It will not be facial recognition software &amp; the automatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;detention of every Muslim that will prevent more terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attacks. 
</em><br>
<p>This is not about muslims, it is about terrorists. 
<br>
<p>We did not round up every muslim, but a few of those currently
<br>
guilty of visa violations.
<br>
<p>More problems with your facts or actually the lack thereof.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It will not be American military might that will prevent more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorist attacks. 
</em><br>
<p>Another side bet?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;America must become responsible &amp; decent. 
</em><br>
<p><p>America is both.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The empty rhetoric of &quot;liberty &amp; justice for all&quot;, the lie of &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protector of freedom&quot; &amp; the &quot;champion of justice&quot; must become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true. America could become what the dream of America has always
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been, America can lead the world, and not just militarily or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commercially but ethically as well, if only the government &amp; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people of America have the strength and courage. 
</em><br>
<p><p>America is the freeist and most just country on the planet.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There can be no justification for the events of 9/11 just as there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be no justification for the many atrocities &amp; crimes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convenience that have been committed in America's name. The cycle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of hatred has to stop somewhere or we will see the events of 9/11
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happening again. And again. And again. 
</em><br>
<p><p>We can and will put an end to terrorism, grab a pen and take notes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;America can be more than just America the great, it could truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become America the good, America the just, America the free, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only the nation &amp; it's people have the courage &amp; the humility to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change for the better, to give as well as receive, to heal instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of harm, to become a true leader of humanity. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Your rhetoric is really starting to get a little thick. I couldn't
<br>
agree less with your opinion of what America currently is.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;The rebuilding of Afghanistan is only the first challenge, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is an important one. It is a chance for the US to show that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is more to it's motives than simple revenge. It is a chance for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US to show that it can rise up against anger &amp; grief &amp; hatred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There was no shortage of bravery among the fire-fighters &amp; police
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who risked all on 9/11 - can America the same selfless courage as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a nation?
</em><br>
<p><p>We will help our friends, smite our enemies, and move on.
