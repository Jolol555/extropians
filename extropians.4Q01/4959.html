<p><p>That's bullshit; you are really working hard to read into it.  My last
<br>
company prefered to outsource the work I do to Canadians.  Does that make me
<br>
or the company I worked for anti-Canadian?  The way you construct it, using
<br>
the word &quot;Jew&quot; in ANY sentence is to be construed as racist.  If it had been
<br>
a Russian job shop instead of an Indian one, would that have not been
<br>
racist?  Since when did certain nationalities and ethnicities become
<br>
unutterable words to all &quot;non-racist&quot; folk?
<br>
<p>If Mike is being displaced by outsourcing to Indian job shops (and it is
<br>
very plausible), then there is nothing in his saying so that can be
<br>
legitimately construed as racist.  Or can a fact be racist?
