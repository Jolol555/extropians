<p><em>    &gt; One small problem.  We were not at war with this country
</em><br>
<p>Some places are not countries they are a mishmash of warlords fighting among
<br>
themselves. I think it's probable that the reason the Taliban doesn't boot out
<br>
Bin Laden is that they can't, he's stronger than the &quot;government&quot; of Afghanistan
<br>
and he has already declared war on us, both in words and in deeds.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;the court should be international, not American.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, after 10 years, 15 more likely, after all the red tape, after the compromises,
<br>
after the provisional feasibility studies, after the environmental impact statements,
<br>
after millions of Americans are dead this wonderful international court of yours
<br>
issues a judgement and condemns Bin Lauden. Now what, who is going to enforce it?
<br>
Well, lets form a sub committee and study the matter, but first lets talk about who should
<br>
be on the committee.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; The government of Sudan has been screwy for sometime but
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; struggling to become more normalized.
</em><br>
<p>They gave safe harbor for years to the most wanted terrorist in the world,
<br>
If they were struggling to be &quot;normal&quot; they weren't struggling very hard.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; There was no nerve gas.
</em><br>
<p>Would you stake your life on that? And even if it never made any it certainly had
<br>
the capacity to do so. I can't say I cry myself to sleep at night because the warlords
<br>
of Sudan no longer have that capability.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;You don't just bomb hell out of your neighbors whenever you feel like it
</em><br>
<p>But you do bomb the hell out of your neighbor when they're trying as hard as they
<br>
possibly can to kill you. Listen to Bin Laden's latest statement, he wants us dead,
<br>
all of us dead, and he has shown it's not just empty words. What  the hell sort of
<br>
people do you think American's are, do you expect us to just stand around with
<br>
our hands in our pockets and let him slaughter us?
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;If that is your attitude then everyone not in your  US club is quite justified in
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;despising you as an immoral curr.
</em><br>
<p>I'd rather be a despised but living cur than a loved but dead coward.
