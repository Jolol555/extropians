<em>&gt; I don't think it is a FAQ - rather it is a FDA: a Frequently Desired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answer. (Ouch, that is a horrible abbreviation :-) As you say, what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need is to create a discourse that builds an answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for po2, I think I can at least throw out a first iteration: trust is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about long-term relations. As Axelrod suggested, you can build trust in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IPD-like situations since participants know they will be around each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other for a long time, and hence it is in their interests to cooperate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it was Novak who later on did some game theory on how reputation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also helps: if your actions become known to others, then it pays to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself trustworthy since other members in your community will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your past actions into account even when they were aimed at somebody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else. So trust can be promoted by making past interactions clearer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well known, and by the awareness of that there is a long future ahead.
</em><br>
<p>Also consider that trust between strangers evolves from each individuals
<br>
characteristics, which is one reason why 'discrimination' or 'prejudice'
<br>
is a natural phenomenon of human relations. If your experience tells you
<br>
that men or women are more trustworthy than the other, you will trust
<br>
individuals in the future based on that experience. If your experience
<br>
is that you can trust blacks more than whites, you will do so with
<br>
blacks you don't know as well (and vice versa if your experience is the
<br>
reverse).
<br>
<p>This is why bin Laden's terrorism handbooks advise infiltrators of the
<br>
US to groom and dress themselves as westerners, obtain western
<br>
identities and documentation, etc: not only does this tactic take
<br>
advantage of this implicit trust, but it also amplifies the effect that
<br>
subsequent terrorist attacks have by causing Americans to question this
<br>
implicit trust of people appearing in western guise.
<br>
<p>This is a blatant attack on the foundations of trust that keep our
<br>
society open and free. Frankly I highly dislike advocating the policies
<br>
of temporary limited repression I currently do, but I see little
<br>
alternative other than to just sit there and accept further attack as a
<br>
cost of being free and open. I want to go back to trusting others again.
<br>
This cannot happen while we remain open to attack.
<br>
<p>This week, we see that our airliners are still no safer, other than that
<br>
passengers are less willing to accept such behavior. Reid was able to
<br>
smuggle a bomb of C-4 onto the plane, despite being extensively checked
<br>
by French authorities and refused entry to a plane once already.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem we face here is that we now have a far larger and diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society with larger tensions - suddenly everything is global, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbour is a gay zoroastrian sociologist and the smallpox genome can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be found on the Internet. Solutions trying to fix things by making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world a smaller place (isolationism) are practiclly unworkable (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits are enormous), as are attempts to put genies back in bottles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (relinquishment). Attempts to make people less diverse are not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethically questionable and impractical, they also tend to breed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistance that produces just the kind of nasty backlashes we have come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fear. Hence any solution has to deal with strengthening those webs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Part of this is mechanisms to better filter out those
<br>
untrustworthies who have infiltrated the webs of trust. As a chain is as
<br>
strong as its weakest link, the solution is to check each and every link
<br>
for integrity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the NYT article makes a mistake by suggesting the choice is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between a less open society (artificial trust established by having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special trusted part - the government - being given all the power), a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more controlled world (which seems to imply the same thing, but now on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global scale) or higher risk. The naked airlines idea really shows a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out: a bit of lateral thinking mixing a technical solution with a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the west has exported hightech but not the social fabrics necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use it reasonably safely, we better find ways of packaging social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fabric with the hightech (maybe as packing material?).
</em><br>
<p>Well, it also depends on the method of application. For instance, take
<br>
face recognition technology. Does a FRT device need to have a database
<br>
of ALL individuals? No, it only needs a database of those whose
<br>
trustworthiness has been limited in some way, much as the Insta-check
<br>
system for firearms purchase only contains names of those who are
<br>
prohibited from purchasing.
<br>
<p>Should a non-citizen have the same trustworthiness as a non-citizen?
<br>
It's rather obvious that a citizen will be more well known by a society
<br>
than a non-citizen of that society. Using the above formula for citizens
<br>
in that crime records only record the reputations of criminals, not of
<br>
law abiding citizens, a criminal citizen would have a more thorough
<br>
reputation with a society than a person who has never violated a law.
<br>
Who is therefore more trustworthy?
<br>
<p>This is why reputation brokers like credit agencies use a flawed
<br>
methodology with citizens, because they automatically assume that
<br>
someone with no reputation is implicity untrustworthy. When you are
<br>
dealing with non-citizens, this may be applicable, but not with
<br>
citizens.
