There is a flaw in this argument.  Since Jones has at times received
<br>
posts from Eliezer past midnight on the left coast, it would be
<br>
past 0300 in Atlanta.  So evidently Eliezer sleeps during
<br>
the day, if he sleeps at all.  y'all.  {8-]  spike

<p>I always thought prominent Elder God extropians like Eliezer, Anders, Max, Natasha, Greg, etc. didn't need sleep.  I remember during Extro-5 when Robert Bradbury would stay up all night holding court in the Hilton bar.  While the rest of us were so painfully tired(but utterly fascinated) he was just full of energy!
<br>
<p>And while at Spike's house, Anders was next door to my bedroom.  Though I would see Anders bedroom light off, sometimes I would hear the noise of rustling pages.  I often wonder if he was actually reading all night, but keeping the lights off so I would not suspect anything!  Of course, night vision comes with the extropian Elder God package deal(or a nightlight).  
<br>
<p>Spike on the other hand did show the normal signs of fatigue at night.  So, I suppose he is still a normal human!
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John :)
