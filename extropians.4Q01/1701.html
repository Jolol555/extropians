MENTAL GYMNASTICS
<br>
Read a book upside down. Brush your teeth with your wrong hand. Sniff
<br>
vanilla essence while listening to classical music. Breaking your normal
<br>
mental routine will help invigorate your brain, and encourage its cells
<br>
to make new connections and pump out neurotrophins that feed and sustain
<br>
its circuits. This is the theory behind &quot;neurobics&quot; - mental workouts
<br>
that are believed to shape and sculpt the brain in much the same way as
<br>
physical exercise tones and trains the body. But does it work? Brain
<br>
scans do indeed suggest we use a lot more of our grey matter when
<br>
carrying out new or strange tasks. And rats raised in bright cages with
<br>
toys are known to sprout more neural connections. So if you exercise
<br>
your brain, will it grow? Is there a brain-boosting regime that could
<br>
allow you to &quot;think&quot; yourself cleverer? This week's New Scientist
<br>
magazine investigates the possibility of turning brains into
<br>
superbrains.
<br>
<p>Keep Your Brain Alive
<br>
<a href="http://www.neurobics.com/explain.html">http://www.neurobics.com/explain.html</a>
<br>
Neurobics is a unique new system of brain exercises based on the latest
<br>
scientific research from leading neurobiology labs around the world -
<br>
including Dr. Katz' lab at the Dept of Neurobiology in the Duke University
<br>
Medical Center in Durham, NC. The deceptively simple exercise program is the
<br>
first and only program scientifically based on the brain's ability to produce
<br>
natural growth factors called neurotrophins that help fight off the effects of
<br>
mental aging. Neurobic exercises use your five physical senses and your
<br>
emotional sense in unexpected ways and encourage you to shake up your everyday
<br>
routines. Neurobics don't require paper and pen or isolating yourself with
<br>
puzzles. Everyday life is the Neurobic Brain gym. They can be done anywhere,
<br>
anytime in offbeat, fun and easy ways while you're getting up, commuting,
<br>
working, eating, shopping or relaxing. They are designed to help the brain
<br>
manufacture its own nutrients that strengthen, preserve and grow brain cells.
<br>
<p>Something as simple as closing your eyes and using your other senses of touch,
<br>
smell and spatial memory to unlock your door, enter your home at the end of
<br>
the day and find your way to the coat closet and answering machine is a
<br>
typical Neurobic exercise. What happens in your brain while you're doing this
<br>
becomes exercise because different, underused nerve pathways and connections
<br>
get activated. The result is the production of a kind of natural brain
<br>
fertilizer that strengthens nerve connections and helps them and your nerve
<br>
cell receivers (dendrites) stay younger and stronger. And the benefit of that
<br>
is a fit and flexible mind ready to meet any mental challenge whether it be
<br>
remembering a name or where your car keys are or mastering a new computer
<br>
program or staying creative in your work.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
