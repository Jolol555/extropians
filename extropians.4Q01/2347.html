On another list, a guy wrote of the `midichlorians' in THE PHANTOM MENACE:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;virtually everything in the Star 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wars universe turns out to be lamer than you think as soon as Lucas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;takes the time to explain it more, the Force being no exception
</em><br>
<p>[I then commented:]
<br>
<p>Same as the let-down when Arthur Clarke `explained' in rather clunkingly
<br>
realistic terms what Kubrick had shown as luminous and numinous and
<br>
incomprehensibly awe-inspiring and all.
<br>
<p>But maybe that's what *has* to happen when scientific understanding--or its
<br>
simulacrum--is brought to bear, despite Richard Dawkins' raptures in
<br>
UNWEAVING THE RAINBOW (frequently echoed by me in science-booster mode).
<br>
Maybe the ancient sensawunda module only works when the rest of the
<br>
reality-checking brain is pushed offline, paradoxical though that might
<br>
seem when the ostensible format is `mind-blowing adventure in a
<br>
scientifically understandable universe'.
<br>
<p>[another pal adds:]
<br>
<p>Indeed. Leaving aside all questions of cinematic preferences for the 
<br>
moment, the question of why almost everybody disliked the midichlorian 
<br>
stuff is interesting. After all, it isn't an nonsensical idea; the Force, 
<br>
&quot;mystical&quot; or not, is an empirically measurable energy field. It has real 
<br>
effects on the material universe - moves solid objects, crushes throats, 
<br>
etc. And sensitivity to it is inherited, so is presumably due to some 
<br>
physical variable affected by genes. So it's hardly surprising that they 
<br>
have developed a method of diagnosing force-sensitivity. The idea that it 
<br>
might be expressed in sub-cellular structures like mitochondria is even a 
<br>
bit interesting as an idea. It's probably the closest thing the Star Wars 
<br>
films have come to actual science fiction. And I like science fiction.
<br>
<p>So why did I hate it all the midichlorian stuff so much? I think that it 
<br>
actually makes sense in functional/developmental terms. The moment of 
<br>
understanding is a thrill, but understanding itself is just a fact. Useful, 
<br>
but not moving, because it is now merely an accomplished fact, without 
<br>
challenge, threat, or promise of future reward. Understanding, Dawkin's 
<br>
raptures aside, is yesterday's news, a done deal.
<br>
<p>There may also be a simple psychological reason; incomprehension and a 
<br>
feeling of being overwhelmed are how kids feel all the time when 
<br>
contemplating the vastness of their world. To feel the unknown is to feel 
<br>
like a kid again, which can also be enjoyable in the right circumstances.
<br>
<p>All of which explains why I, a science fan of long standing and unashamed 
<br>
supporter and apologist for technology and modernity, cannot deny a feeling 
<br>
of wary disappointment at the notion that scientists may one day find a 
<br>
unified theory of everything that would take all mystery out of the 
<br>
material universe. Cut it down to size, so to speak. This despite the fact 
<br>
that as a more-or-less extropian, I am rooting for them to get on and 
<br>
explain it all in time to save my butt.
<br>
<p>The Loch Ness Monster as a mysterious, unexplained phenomenon is exciting. 
<br>
Like an unopened Xmas Present, it is full of possibilities. Explained, even 
<br>
as something as unusual as a living plesiosaur, it is just a zoo exhibit. 
<br>
Sigh. Face it, a mysterious universe will always be more entertaining.
<br>
<p>====================================
<br>
<p>It's worth musing on this observable effect, I think. I now expect to read
<br>
a dozen rants explaining why *knowing* is better than *nescience*, and more
<br>
satisfying, and more deeply numinous than nay-saying ignorant bullshit...
<br>
but the fact is, it often isn't experienced that way. We might need to take
<br>
this into account.
