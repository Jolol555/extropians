In an economical reasonning, I think it is natural to consider the
<br>
agents as (generally, more or less) rational, and seeking their
<br>
interest. That doesn't make one paranoid, or hater of the human race.
<br>
<p>This doesn't mean that some other of your arguments aren't valid.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Darn, I was hoping nobody would ask. I have work up to my armpits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The thing that annoys me most about what he writes is that he appeals to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's preconceptions and prejudices then gives them just enough to make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them think he has justified their biases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Imagine a world government, democratically elected according to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;principle of one-man-one-vote on a world wide scale. What would the probable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;outcome of an election be? Most likely, we would get a Chinese-Indian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;coalition government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an appeal to xenophobia. In his eyes the worst we could do is give 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;them&quot; any power over &quot;us&quot;. Of course if the logic of his statement is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed properly, when &quot;they&quot; have democratic societies then &quot;they&quot; are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;us&quot; and we share responsibility in a world together, but he has no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest in this. He wants to divide people and use xenophobia to make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy look like a bad idea: &quot;they&quot; can't possibly use votes sensibly, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so should never be allowed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And what would this government most likely decide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;do in order to satisfy its supporters and be reelected? The government would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;probably find that the so-called Western world had far too much wealth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the rest of the world, in particular China and India, had far too little,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and hence, that a systematic wealth and income redistribution would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;called for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are very good arguments for wealth redistribution. He is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in them. He wants to scare people into thinking that democracy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is somehow equated with the idea that &quot;they&quot; could come and take &quot;our&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth away. In actual fact raising the rest of the world towards the level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of wealth of the developed world would more likely make the developed world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even richer. I won't go into those arguments here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Or imagine, for your own country, that the right to vote were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;expanded to seven year olds. While the government would not likely be made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;up of children, its policies would most definitely reflect the 'legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;concerns' of children to have 'adaequate' and 'equal' access to 'free'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hamburgers, lemonade, and videos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here he uses an absurd scenario to bolster his argument. It draws upon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's biases again. Many people automatically think that children are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally irresponsible (the Lord Of The Flies syndrome). I am continually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amazed at how quickly people forget how they thought when they were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children. For a year I managed Awaba, a virtual world for Australian kids. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I decided to make it an experiment in anarchy and laid out the ground rules 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early on that there be no laws. There was only one guiding principle: that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people try not to upset each other. What I found was that the kids were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very responsible, helpful, and mature. We had kids as young as 5 years old 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming into the world and building and interacting with other kids. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Problems were extremely rare.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hoppe's sneering attitude to kids and other groups underlines much of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he says in his article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;One-man-one-vote combined with 'free entry' into government - democracy -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;implies that every person and his personal property comes within reach of -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and is up for grabs by - everyone else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leaving aside the fact that very few places in the world have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-man-one-vote -- most have some kind of inequitable vote distribution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built into the system. (But it is better than no vote... and I firmly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe getting better.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, leaving that aside, he never really shows how democracy has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything to do with his demon of &quot;them&quot; grabbing what &quot;we&quot; have. He thinks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that by giving people the chance to vote for self-determination the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing that they will do is steal from their neighbor. He has a very low 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion of people, and he shows that time and time again throughout the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democracy is not the same thing as socialism, and neither of those are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same as communism. Giving people the right to have a say in their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future instead of being ruled by &quot;those that know better&quot; doesn't mean that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world reverts to pure communism. To equate democracy and communism is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either sloppy or intentionally deceptive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;A 'tragedy of the commons' is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;created. It can be expected that majorities of 'have-nots' will relentlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;try to enrich themselves at the expense of minorities of 'haves'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gee, he is *sooo* paranoid. He really has a fixation that the poor will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come and take away his goodies and keeps harping on this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the past, the only time such uprisings have happened is when the rich 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have put the bulk of people into servitude and turned themselves into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealthy parasites. However it sounds just like the sort of system he wants, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so in a funny way he would be correct in his paranoia that they would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebel, and come and take his stuff away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;...the 'permanently' rich and the 'permanently' poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are usually rich or poor for a reason. The rich are characteristically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bright and industrious, and the poor typically dull, lazy, or both. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;not very likely that dullards, even if they make up a majority, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;systematically outsmart and enrich themselves at the expense of a minority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of bright and energetic individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am continually blown away by his contempt for the human race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have friends who are poor and are the hardest workers I have known. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also have friends who are rich and lethargic. And I have friends who are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich and diligent and work themselves into an early grave. I have friends 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are poor and are the most hopeless slobs. But each of those people is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good person and I am honored to be able to call them all friends. I can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of any who would enrich themselves at the expense of their fellows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But even if he was right in his low estimation of people, given his point 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the smarties will always cream off the best stuff and leave the whey 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the dummies, what is his problem? I know what his problem is. He needs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total assurance that &quot;they&quot; could never hope to gain *any* of his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages. This is why I called him a fascist. He needs total power over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the poor, that they could never hope to rise beyond their natural station 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in life. Only the rich should have the right to &quot;systematically outsmart 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and enrich themselves at the expense&quot; of others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Rather, most redistribution will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;place within the group of the 'non-poor', and frequently it will actually be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the better-off who succeed in having themselves subsidized by the worse-off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Just think of the almost universal practice of offering a 'free' university
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;education, whereby the working class, whose children rarely attend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;universities, is made to pay for the education of middle-class children!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is weird jump in logic! He would have you believe that free university 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education would be disadvantageous to the poor!!! Leave aside the fact that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free university education is far from universal these days, the only way he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can conclude that a free uni education is bad for the poor is if they never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use it. But the fact is they *do* use it! Many poor individuals and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; families still put themselves through hell to get themselves or their kids 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through uni even now when it costs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Moreover, it can be expected that there will be many competing groups and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;coalitions trying to gain at the expense of others. There will be various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;changing criteria defining what it is that makes one person a 'have'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(deserving to be looted) and another a 'have-not' (deserving to receive the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;loot). At the same time, individuals will be members of a multitude of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;groups of 'haves' and/or 'have-nots', losing on account of one of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;characteristic and gaining on account of another, with some individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ending up net-losers and others net-winners of redistribution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is strange that he sees all social life as a battle of one group against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another, each trying to rob the other. In his universe each individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to lie awake at night trying to work out ways to rob their neighbor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blind. But that isn't how the bulk of humanity works at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In reality many people enjoy collaborating on worthy projects. Many people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pursue ideals that relate little to money at all. Most people want to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensure their family are comfortable and well provided for. For very few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people that involves stabbing others in the back in order to get it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While his article tells us little about real society, it speaks volumes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about his own psyche.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;All redistribution, regardless of the criterion on which it is based,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;involves 'taking' from the original owners and/or producers (the 'havers' of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;something) and 'giving' to non-owners and non-producers (the 'non-havers' of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;something). The incentive to be an original owner or producer of the thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in question is reduced, and the incentive to be a non-owner and non-producer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is raised. Accordingly, as a result of subsidizing individuals because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are poor, there will be more poverty. In subsidizing people because they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unemployed, more unemployment will be created. Supporting single mothers out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of tax funds will lead to an increase in single motherhood, 'illegitimacy',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and divorce. In outlawing child labor, income is transfered from families
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with children to childless persons (as a result of the legal restriction on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the supply of labor, wage rates will rise). Accordingly, the birthrate will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fall. On the other hand, by subsidizing the education of children, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;opposite effect is created. Income is transfered from the childless and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;those with few children to those with many children. As a result the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;birthrate will increase. Yet then the value of children will again fall, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;birthrates will decline as a result of the so-called Social Security System,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for in subsidizing retirees (the old) out of taxes imposed on current income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;earners (the young), the institution of a family - the intergenerational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bond between parents, grandparents, and children - is systematically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;weakened. The old need no longer rely on the assistance of their children if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they have made no provision for their own old age, and the young (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;typically less accumulated wealth) must support the old (with typically more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;accumulated wealth) rather than the other way around, as is typical within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;families. Parents' wish for children, and children's wish for parents will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;decline, family breakups and dysfunctional families will increase, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;provisionary action - saving and capital formation - will fall, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;consumption rises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This long-winded rave is so screwy I am reluctant to even comment upon it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He starts by saying that all redistribution is a taking and giving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involving takers and givers. This is such a simplistic statement that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost feel inclined to let it go... but I can't, because it is so easy to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of ways to redistribute wealth with the rich investing in some group 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of poor, helping them to develop ways to create wealth, and at the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time returning more wealth to the rich person who provided the initial seed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then he gets onto that favorite taboo of many paranoid money-lovers: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsidising. He makes the nutty assertion that by subsidising people you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take away their desire and you spread poverty. This runs completely counter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reality. I know many libertarians believe so strongly in it that it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amounts almost to fanaticism, but it is one thing to believe something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on Hollywood stereotypes, and quite another thing to have experience 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with such people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He gets fairly muddled at a few points in the above paragraph talking about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsidised single parents, child labor, subsidised child education, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retirees all having direct effects upon the birth rate. But that is just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trite nonsense and not even worth my time. He waves his arms airily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appealing again to people's prejudices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In subsidizing the malingerers, the neurotics, the careless, the alcoholics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the drug addicts, the Aids-infected, and the physically and mentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;'challenged' through insurance regulation and compulsory health insurance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;there will be more illness, malingering, neuroticism, carelessness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;alcoholism, drug addiction, Aids infection, and physical and mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;retardation. By forcing non-criminals, including the victims of crime, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pay for the imprisonment of criminals (rather than making criminals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;compensate their victims and pay the full cost of their own apprehension and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;incarceration), crime will increase. By forcing businessmen, through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;'affirmative action' ('non-discrimination') programs, to employ more women,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;homosexuals, blacks, or other 'minorities' than they would like to, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will be more employed minorities, and fewer employers and fewer male,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;heterosexual, and white employment. By compelling private land owners to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;subsidize ('protect') 'endangered species' residing on their land through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;environmental legislation, there will be more and better-off animals, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fewer and worse-off humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow! He not only hates most people but animals too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see why he doesn't just kill himself and be done with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He should at least get some therapy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just couldn't be bothered arguing with this. Anybody who can't see the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holes in this has already embraced such warped philosophies so tightly that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything I say here is not going to change them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Grrr... darn. I can't let it go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If he thinks that people will get ill (he especially singles out AIDS) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because there is insurance, then is is an idiot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He plays the same old tunes over and over to make his listener dance if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they share some of his prejudices. Yes folks, &quot;we&quot; goodies shouldn't be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying for those dirty criminals. They should pay for their crimes. (Well, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do have that arrangement already, or hasn't he noticed?) But, he says, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the &quot;criminal&quot; is one of &quot;us&quot; then they shouldn't have to pay -- they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should, for example, be able to wipe out endangered species with impunity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His rants are jumping all over the place. The only common thread is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thick, smelly vein of prejudice and hate that runs through it all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Most importantly, by compelling private property owners and/or market income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;earners (producers) to subsidize 'politicians', 'political parties', and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;'civil servants' (politicians and government employees do not pay taxes but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are paid out of taxes), there will be less wealth formation, fewer producers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and less productivity, and ever more waste, 'parasites' and parasitism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Charlie mentioned, very few people today are primary producers. If civil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; servants are seen as parasites then a good case can be made for Hoppe being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a parasite too, and me, and most of you reading this. But of course we are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not parasites (well, maybe Hoppe is) we weave thoughts and concepts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together that add value to other things... whether it is making a computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of manufactured chips, refined metal and synthesised plastic, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether it is rearranging light on a screen to create virtual worlds for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to meet and play in, or whether it is teaching other people so that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are capable of doing these things, or whether it is organising the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monetary accounts for someone else to give them the time to do these things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, as Charlie mentioned, the civil servants are workers who, like the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of us spend their wages and facilitate movement of money which helps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make for a healthy economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Contrast this point with what Hoppe wants: a world where all wealth resides 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanently in a static rich class with a moribund economy. The poor have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little to spend so the wealthy get richer mainly by feeding off each other. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The economy would stagnate and the whole system would get more and more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstable and top-heavy till it came crashing down in social upheaval and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebellion. Yeah, sounds like such a great future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Businessmen (capitalists) and their employees cannot earn an income unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they produce goods or services which are sold in markets. The buyers'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;purchases are voluntary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except when it is necessary for life... or when it is a monopoly... or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where fashion-brainwashing is involved...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hoppe loves simplistic ideas. They make his wonky arguments look as if they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually mean something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;By buying a good or service, the buyers (consumers)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;demonstrate that they prefer this good or service over the sum of money that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;they must surrender in order to acquire it. In contrast, politicians,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;parties, and civil servants produce nothing which is sold in markets. No one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;buys government 'goods' or 'services'. They are produced, and costs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;incurred to produce them, but they are not sold and bought. On the one hand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this implies that it is impossible to determine their value and find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;whether or not this value justifies their costs. Because no one buys them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;no one actually demonstrates that he considers government goods and services
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;worth their costs, and indeed, whether or not anyone attaches any value to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;them at all. From the viewpoint of economic theory, it is thus entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;illegitimate to assume, as is always done in national income accounting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that government goods and services are worth what it costs to produce them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and then to simply add this value to that of the 'normal', privately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;produced (bought and sold) goods and services to arrive at gross domestic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(or national) product, for instance. It might as well be assumed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;government goods and services are worth nothing, or even that they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;goods&quot; at all but &quot;bads&quot;; hence, that the cost of politicians and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;entire civil service should be subtracted from the total value of privately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;produced goods and services. Indeed, to assume this would be far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;justified. For on the other hand, as to its practical implications, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;subsidizing of politicians and civil servants amounts to a subsidy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;'produce' with little or no regard for the well-being of one's alleged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;consumers, and with much or sole regard instead for the well-being of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;'producers', i.e., the politicians and civil servants. Their salaries remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the same, whether their output satisfies consumers or not. Accordingly, as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;result of the expansion of 'public' sector employment, there will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;increasing laziness, carelessness, incompeence, disservice, maltreatment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;waste, and even destruction - and at the same time ever more arrogance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;demagogery, and lies ('we work for the public good').
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, as we can see from the above Hoppe knows a lot about arrogance, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demagogery, and lies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Australia 2 of our TV channels are government subsidised. It is often 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned by them and others that we pay just a few cents a day for them (I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it is 12c... my bad memory for numbers comes out again). They are far 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better value than the crappy, cloned, lowest-common-denominator, commercial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; channels. This is even more evident with the radio stations. Commercial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radio survives on regurgitating music from the past few decades and running 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-brow talkback. Government-subsidised stations run documentaries on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important topics (often angering the politicians and big businesses in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their exposes) and one government-subsidised, Australia-wide station in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular -- Triple J -- plays cool music for kids that no commercial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; station will touch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, just because it may be difficult to place a $$ value on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something it doesn't mean it is worthless or has a negative value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;After less than one hundred years of democracy and redistribution, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;predictable results are in. The 'reserve fund' that was inherited from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;past is apparently exhausted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh boy... he sounds like a religious fundamentalist. They want people to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think things are getting worse too. Unfortunately for them, we are better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off than ever before and it is getting better. There doesn't look to be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limit to how well-off we can all become.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;For several decades (since the late 1960s or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the early 1970s), real standards of living have stagnated or even fallen in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the West.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He says while typing on his amazingly powerful computer connected to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet. He sits in his air-conditioned office, wearing a cotton underwear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and immaculate, inexpensive shoes and clothes, probably munching on a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microwaved frozen snack, with these standards available now to more people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than ever before. Today he has the ability to learn almost anything he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants at almost no cost... if he chooses to open his eyes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The 'public' debt and the cost of the existing social security and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;health care system have brought on the prospect of an imminent economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;meltdown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reagan and his right-wing reaganomics ruined USA's wealth. Didn't he take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; USA from being the biggest creditor nation to the biggest debtor nation in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the western world? Thatcher did the same thing to UK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More recent redeployment of the safety net has helped to undo some of that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and give people the ability to take risks again, however I don't wish to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oversimplify -- obviously much more is involved than just re-establishment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a safety net.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;At the same time, almost every form of undesirable behavior -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unemployment, welfare dependency, negligence, recklessness, uncivility,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;psychopathy, hedonism and crime - has increased, and social conflict and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;societal breakdown have risen to dangerous heights. If current trends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;continue, it is safe to say that the Western welfare state (social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;democracy) will collapse just as Eastern (Russian-style) socialism collapsed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;in the late 1980s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually many of those indicators have been lessening.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Property crimes have lifted a little sometimes during periods of less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money, but on the whole they, along with other criminal activity seem to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declining. Ask any criminologist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hoppe doesn't need to ask anyone -- he &quot;knows&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, I couldn't be bothered with the rest of this. He continues with his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar hate-rant. It will achieve nothing to rebuke it further.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have work to do and bills to pay.
