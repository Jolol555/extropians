<em>&gt;Randy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have stated many, many times, that I think that ANYONE and EVERYONE with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;legitimate MD shoukd be able to come here to the USA. In fact, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggested PAYING them large sums of money to come here. I have suggested
</em><br>
<em>&gt;building medical schools in 3rd worlds so we can get MORE M.D.s here. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same thing goes for PhD's or even for *legitimate* students who want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;study for a PhD here, and already have a *good* degree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;### Good. Here we agree - persons with skills useful in the American 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should not be prevented from joining the job market here,
</em><br>
<p><p>Let me clarify: I think that people with advanced degrees in science and 
<br>
expecially MD's are beneficial to the &quot;owners&quot; of America (its citizens) and 
<br>
therefore I espouse allowing them into our country, our commonly property.  
<br>
Just as many businesses seek to hire people who will benefit the business. 
<br>
If I, Randy Smith, own a business, and I want to hire, I hire the person who 
<br>
will benefit me, Randy Smith.  And if I am a partner in a business, we, the 
<br>
partners, will dicuss candidates, and hire the ones that benefit us, the 
<br>
partners, the most.  The candidates that are more likely to put more pieces 
<br>
of green paper in the wallets of the partners are those candidates who will 
<br>
be hired. An advanced degree is science is often a good marker of such a 
<br>
candidate (in many cases).
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;certainly not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protect anybody's six-figure income from competition.
</em><br>
<p>See above re: &quot;greem pieces of paper&quot;. That means currency, money, moola, 
<br>
bucks, etc.  And since we own the &quot;place of business&quot; we are INDEED 
<br>
concerned about OUR income.
<br>
That, my friend, is the way of the world. Unfortunately, many of my AMerican 
<br>
citizen-partners have been swayed by very wealthy parties such as 
<br>
corporations, who benefit from bringing in more immigrants to lower wages.
