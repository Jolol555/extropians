<p><p>Chrysler Offers Fuel Cell Van with Soapy Twist
<br>
By Justin Hyde
<br>
<p>DETROIT (Reuters) - A chemical cousin of laundry detergent could make
<br>
clean-running cars and trucks a reality, if a new fuel cell concept
<br>
vehicle from the Chrysler side of DaimlerChrysler AG proves its worth.
<br>
<p>Chrysler said its Natrium concept minivan pairs a hydrogen powered fuel
<br>
cell with a novel fuel storage system that uses borax, the active
<br>
ingredient in many detergents. The setup offers a way around some vexing
<br>
problems that have hindered the development of hydrogen-powered fuel
<br>
cell vehicles, which hold the promise of pollution-free transportation.
<br>
<p>``The most important unresolved issue with fuel cell vehicles is not the
<br>
fuel cell -- it's the fuel,'' said Thomas Moore, head of Chrysler's
<br>
Liberty research and development group, in a statement released Tuesday.
<br>
<p>Fuel cells use hydrogen to produce electricity with only heat and water
<br>
as byproducts. Automakers are spending billions of dollars on the theory
<br>
that fuel cells will eventually replace polluting internal combustion
<br>
engines as power sources in cars and trucks.
<br>
<p>But most automakers have also said it would be at least a decade before
<br>
fuel-cell vehicles are common, in part because of the problems with
<br>
storing and using highly flammable hydrogen. Concepts from General
<br>
Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and several other companies either use
<br>
``reformers'' to extract hydrogen from liquid fuels or try to store pure
<br>
hydrogen in large, high-pressure tanks.
<br>
<p>Both methods have drawbacks in cost, weight and size. Reformers require
<br>
either gasoline or methanol, and produce some pollution on their own.
<br>
And the driving range of fuel cell concept vehicles so far has been
<br>
about half or less of similar production vehicles.
<br>
<p>To solve those problems, Chrysler's system stores hydrogen in sodium
<br>
borohydride powder, which is nonflammable and nontoxic. After mixing
<br>
with water, the solution is passed through a catalyst which separates
<br>
the hydrogen gas and leaves only sodium boride, or borax, as a residue.
<br>
The borax can then be recycled into sodium borohydride.
<br>
<p>Unlike gasoline, the chemicals in Chrysler's system are readily
<br>
available in North America and much of the world. A tank of sodium
<br>
borohydride solution about the size of a regular gas tank can power the
<br>
concept vehicle about 300 miles -- much further than other fuel-cell
<br>
vehicles.
<br>
<p>There are several problems Chrysler hasn't solved yet, the major one
<br>
being how to deliver the chemicals and recycle borax once it's used.
<br>
Chrysler and its partner on the Natrium, Millennium Cell Inc., said they
<br>
also needed to develop a better method for putting hydrogen back into
<br>
the chemicals; the current process uses natural gas and produces some
<br>
pollution.
<br>
<p>Chrysler said the Natrium would be provided later next year as a test
<br>
vehicle to the California Fuel Cell Partnership, a government and
<br>
industry joint venture aimed at testing fuel cell vehicles and speeding
<br>
their development.
