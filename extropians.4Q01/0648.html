SlugBot: Enemy of Slugs
<br>
By Louise Knapp
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,47156,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,47156,00.html</a>
<br>
In the near future, the very mention of SlugBot could send waves of terror
<br>
through the slug community, while farmers will sing its praises.
<br>
<p>A prototype robot capable of hunting down over 100 slugs an hour and using
<br>
their rotting bodies to generate electricity is being developed by engineers
<br>
at the University of West England's Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory.
<br>
<p>The SlugBot is an attempt to build the world's first fully autonomous robot.
<br>
When completed, the SlugBot will be the first robot to work completely
<br>
independent of human care. It won't even need help to recharge its batteries.
<br>
<p>&quot;Slugs are slow,&quot; said Dr. Ian Kelly, SlugBot's creator. &quot;You can't expect the
<br>
speeds of a cheetah chasing a zebra. Slugs are small and manageable.&quot;
<br>
<p>Resembling a DJ's turntable mounted on four wheels, the robot has a carbon
<br>
fiber arm with a three-fingered claw grabber at the end. The claw is equipped
<br>
with an electronic eye for finding its slimy prey and scrapers for wiping off
<br>
slug slime.
<br>
<p>The robot's arm can rotate through 360 degrees and reach nearly 2 meters in
<br>
any direction, including upwards.
<br>
<p>&quot;It takes a lot of energy to move over rough terrain,&quot; said Kelly who is
<br>
currently working at the Collective Robotics Research Group at California's
<br>
Institute of Technology. &quot;Having a long reach means the robot does not have to
<br>
move around so much.&quot;
<br>
<p>The SlugBot uses an electronic eye mounted on its claw to ferret out slugs,
<br>
which are nocturnal.
<br>
<p>Slugs are difficult to see at night with the naked eye, but show up as bright
<br>
blobs in the SlugBot's image sensor when illuminated with a special red lamp.
<br>
<p>When it spots a slug, the SlugBot picks it up and drops it into an on-board
<br>
hopper, which is about the size of a two-liter ice cream container.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is a problem with stopping the captured slugs from climbing out,&quot; Kelly
<br>
said. &quot;We may utilize a low-energy electronic shock system to keep them in the
<br>
container.&quot;
<br>
<p>The SlugBot navigates using a combination of the Global Positioning Satellite
<br>
(GPS) system, and an active infrared localization system. It detects obstacles
<br>
through a combination of ultrasonic sonar and bump sensors.
<br>
<p>After a hard night of slug hunting, the robot returns to home base and unloads
<br>
its victims into a fermentation tank.
<br>
<p>And while the SlugBot recharges, the fermentation station is busy turning slug
<br>
sludge into electricity.
<br>
<p>Decomposing bacteria converts the slugs into a combustible bio-gas, which is
<br>
then loaded into a fuel cell to generate electricity.
<br>
<p>Kelly and his team decided to use slugs as a source of energy for an
<br>
autonomous robot because they are so easy to capture. They also have no
<br>
exoskeleton, which makes them easier to break down in the robot's digestive
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>Slugs are also plentiful; up to 200 slugs can be found per square meter in
<br>
fields of winter wheat, which makes them a major pest. About $30 million a
<br>
year is spent in Great Britain alone trying to eradicate the slimy critters.
<br>
<p>Kelly said he'd like to see armies of coordinated SlugBots protecting
<br>
farmland, eradicating slugs from farmers' crops.
<br>
<p>&quot;The robots will share a map between them showing where the greater density of
<br>
slugs are and allowing them to coordinate so they don't get into each other's
<br>
way and so they don't go back to the same area two days in a row,&quot; Kelly said.
<br>
<p>Kelly said one of the main advantages of SlugBot is that it may help phase out
<br>
molluscicides, harmful pesticides that kill slugs and snails.
<br>
<p>&quot;Molluscicides have the side effect of killing off other things and because
<br>
they are used in such high quantities they can get into the ground water,&quot;
<br>
Kelly said.
<br>
<p>So far, the team has built a prototype SlugBot, which has cost around $3,000
<br>
in parts. Kelly said the price would come down if the robot went into mass
<br>
production. And of course, there are few ongoing expenses.
<br>
<p>The SlugBot will not, however, be ready for the production line for at least
<br>
another three to four years.
<br>
<p>So far, it has been tested only in the lab. Kelly said it has correctly
<br>
identified and homed in on slugs, but has trouble picking them up, especially
<br>
if they are partly nestled in dirt.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have accomplished the hard part of the research by getting the robot to
<br>
identify the slug,&quot; Kelly said.
<br>
<p>Diane Schivera, assistant director of technical services with the Maine
<br>
Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, said smaller growers probably
<br>
couldn't afford slug-eating robots.
<br>
<p>&quot;Using copper tape as a deterrent or Remay (a thin fabric cover) would
<br>
probably be less expensive,&quot; Schivera said. &quot;Plants are only at risk from
<br>
slugs when they are babies, so these methods for smaller farmers work.&quot;
<br>
<p>However, Schivera said that increasing pressure to move away from pesticides
<br>
may cause some farmers to consider it.
<br>
<p>&quot;For bigger farmers it may be something that might work,&quot; Schivera said.
<br>
&quot;Those with extra cash to blow on something like this.&quot;
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
