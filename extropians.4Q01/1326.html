<p>&lt;&lt; The correct relation between Wahabism and violence is this: Most Wahabis 
<br>
are
<br>
&nbsp;not violent -but-virtually all violent Muslims are Wahabis. i don't know how
<br>
&nbsp;close to correct 80% is but I'm confident the figure is over 50%. That does
<br>
&nbsp;not mean 80% or what ever of U.S. muslims are fifth columnists but that
<br>
&nbsp;there is a minorty who are. Typically young, male, unmarried and fairly well
<br>
&nbsp;educated, probably in the sciences. SD

I don't think this is like an equation. I think that there is a more simpler 
<br>
approach. If the United States is able to impose it's will on the world, and 
<br>
its &quot;will&quot; has a payoff for the &quot;imposed-on&quot;, then we have, perhaps, a much 
<br>
more stable, and progressive, world situation.
<br>
<p>What the USA's &quot;will&quot; turns out to be, is a matter of great conjecture, and 
<br>
is subjective in nature. Many people will be outraged by my jingoistic 
<br>
statement. But I will stick with it anyway. Let me set up some sub-goals for 
<br>
this great world future, that I will impose from my computer desk, to the 
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>1.Peace, or the supression of violence.
<br>
2. Global prosperity
<br>
2.Non-violent revolutionary political changes
<br>
3.An expansion of secular-democracy, also known as a republic
<br>
4.Global education and an internationalization of goods and services
<br>
<p>Meta-Goal/Method: Utilization of Science and Technology to supports the 
<br>
aforementioned goals.
<br>
<p>You want to defuse Islamic Fundamentalist Guerilla Terror, aimed at the USA
<br>
(which is what W Bush really is aiming for)
<br>
<p>Hatred of America crosses tribal and political lines in the Islamic &quot;world&quot;. 
<br>
Not all the Islamic celebrators of September 11 attacks, are hard-line 
<br>
religious fundies. My niece in NJ personally viewed, what appeared to be 
<br>
Arabic families celebrating the smoke column in the foreground, laughing and 
<br>
posing for pictures.
<br>
<p>To undermine, the religious fanatics, the USA must possess technological 
<br>
prowess, and know how to use it. I am suggesting goodies and not war 
<br>
material-energy technolgies, medical advances, other goodies they would want 
<br>
and we would have.
<br>
Plus, yes, we need to also work on the military aspects too, but having our 
<br>
own fuel supplies is far more critical.
<br>
<p>My brother-in-law attended a conference on epidemilogival attacks on the 
<br>
city-tularemia, smallpox, yes ...anthrax, botulinus clostridium, etc. We are 
<br>
vulnerable, but we also have to focus, in a parabnoid way, on potential 
<br>
attackers, before they attack. That is the short-term, while the long-term is 
<br>
technology, and the attraction of western walues and lifestyle, to undermine 
<br>
the wahabis, the saddams, the khomeinis, the khaddafy's etc.
