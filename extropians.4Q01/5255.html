<p>Consider the case of the Geo Metro/Toyota Corolla.  As you may know if
<br>
you read Consumer Reports, they rate cars using customer feedback.  The
<br>
Chevrolet Geo rated about one standard deviation below average whereas
<br>
the Corolla rated one sigma above.  The punchline is that it is exactly
<br>
the
<br>
same car.  Both were manufactured at the Fremont Taxifornia, right up
<br>
the
<br>
street from where we had Extro5.  Being loss leaders, neither car was
<br>
significantly modified by either Toyota or GMC.
<br>
<p>The investigation caused a huge uproar, with Chevrolet accusing the
<br>
Fremont plant of sending them the Monday and Friday cars, with the
<br>
nice Tuesday thru Thursday cars going to Toyota.  A huge investigation
<br>
ensued, which exonerated the Fremont plant.  The cars were pretty
<br>
much random, but the customers were claiming their Toyotas were
<br>
better, according to Consumer Reports.
<br>
<p>Chevrolet then investigated their dealers.  Perhaps the dealers were
<br>
treating the buyers of loss-leaders with no respect, causing them to
<br>
perhaps dislike their cars and take less care of them.  That theory
<br>
was not proven.
<br>
<p>It was never adequately explained why a Japanese car scored 2 sigma
<br>
higher than an American car, even tho the machines were mechanically
<br>
indistinguishable.  I dont know how that incident ever finished out, but
<br>
<p>I now view with suspicion those reports that Japanese manufacturing
<br>
quality is inherently better than that of the US or Europe.
<br>
<p>Those of you who notice motorcycles, next nice spring day count
<br>
the number of Harleys you see on the road.  All this expensive iron
<br>
from a company that was nearly buried in much cheaper Japanese
<br>
imports back in the mid 80s.  spike
