Yes, it is an extremely serious concern. However, the Military of 1945 did 
<br>
not have effective spy satellites as we possess today, and the analysis 
<br>
capability, to identify critical targets. A massed army can eliminated with 
<br>
nuclear strikes, and a dispersed line of invaders can be decimated with high 
<br>
explosives, such as the daisy cutter. And ultimately, if one was faced with a 
<br>
large Islamist threat, there are two areas that would induce large-scale 
<br>
political and psychological disruption-Mecca and Medina. If those two cities 
<br>
were eliminated, it would &quot;prove&quot; that Allah was on the side of the Kaffirs 
<br>
and using them to deliver a fatwa on the Muslim peoples.
<br>
<p>Even though we have to face our problems I would prefer emphasizing the 
<br>
&quot;better memes of our nature&quot; and work on clean energy production and matters 
<br>
of space and time. I am not denying I thinking like a murderous, bastard; 
<br>
merely that I am happier focusing on happier issues.
<br>
<p><p><p>&lt;&lt;We should heed those lessons -- a pan-Arabic state stretching from
<br>
Algeria to Pakistan with 500+ million people, united under
<br>
a single leader (Hitler/Stalin prototype) and/or an interpreted
<br>
(irrational) religious unifying force, with atomic weapons
<br>
*is* something to be seriously concerned about.
