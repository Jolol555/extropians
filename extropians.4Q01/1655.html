<p>Who's going to pay the absurd costs of enforcement? You and I? Why

would any rational individual choose to do that? That's what.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First I'd do probably exactly what the copyright holders are doing,

<br>
<p><em>&gt; people who manufacture equipment that assists in this theft.

<p>You mean, CD-burners, ethernet cards, general purpose computers?
<br>
Pretty much everything except the constitutionally protected
<br>
presses of the dead tree variety?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I had the political clout, I'd go after the backbone itself,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S.
</em><br>
<p>Filter WHAT? Specific ports? Specific types of protocols?  Snoop the
<br>
content ala carnivore? How would you prove beyond the faintest
<br>
possibility of any doubt to me, the voter and consumer you're trying
<br>
to convince, that my &quot;I Hate Disney&quot; website, my manuscript for a book
<br>
about why drugs should be legalized, and my pornographic cartoons
<br>
featuring Jesus will not be snooped, censored, investigated, or
<br>
touched in any way?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People aren't opting for the free alternatives, they want these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; items, they just don't want to have to pay for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the digital age theft has become so easy and the chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punishment so small, that millions pretend they're not stealing at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.
</em><br>
<p>You may be among the few individuals who do things motivated by right
<br>
and wrong. Sadly, most others are insipred by maximizing their
<br>
material benefit and minimizing their material cost.  Or at least
<br>
that's what they were teaching in economics last time I took a class
<br>
in it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They are trying to protect their material and it's associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenue stream.
</em><br>
<p>Of course they are. Just as I as an independent content creator and
<br>
consumer am attempting to break their chokehold on the market. Their
<br>
revenue stream is of no interest to me, just as I'm sure mine is of no
<br>
interest to them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Call it downloading, call it theft, call it etaoin shrdlu. The age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of whatever you choose to call it is upon us. Perhaps I misnamed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this thread. I should have posed it as a question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's like the old story about &quot;if you call a dogs tail a leg how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many legs does a dog have?&quot; The answer is still four because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling the tail a leg doesn't make it one. Calling theft of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copyrighted material &quot;downloading&quot; doesn't make it a leg either.
</em><br>
<p>Nor does calling downloading of copyrighted material &quot;theft&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I await your answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You got it.
</em><br>
<p>No, I haven't, but it's my own fault for not being clear enough. I
<br>
meant the answer to the question &quot;When is an MP3 anything but a
<br>
nonexcludable, nonrival good?&quot;
<br>
<p>To save time, I'm preemptively rebutting the following answers:
<br>
<p>1) Because it's just wrong to copy something without the original author's
<br>
permission.
<br>
Why this argument is not valid: argument by axiom, argument by definition.
<br>
C.f. &quot;It's just wrong for unmarried adults to have sex with each other&quot;
<br>
<p>2) Because it's illegal to copy something without the original author's
<br>
permission.
<br>
Why this argument is not valid: laws are a human construct. Humans
<br>
pass, obey, enforce, and repeal them. I'm NOT only arguing against
<br>
obeying intellectual property laws. I'm arguing against passage,
<br>
obedience, enforcement, and for repeal. I don't dispute the fact that
<br>
under current law the majority of this list are criminals of one
<br>
non-violent sort or another, including but not restricted to copyright
<br>
infringement. I dispute the legitimacy, utility, and enforceability of
<br>
current law. C.f. &quot;The Bible is the book of God because it says so in
<br>
the Bible&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Aside to Eliezer and Mike: tbbbpt! Last time I'll ever be metaphorical
<br>
with you guys. Really.
<br>
