This isn't exactly new - Antonio Damasio made a name for himself in
<br>
quite wide circles with his _Descarte's Error_ a few years back. The
<br>
emotional systems are essential for putting value into decisions (not to
<br>
mention motivation), and without them rational decisions tend not to
<br>
work. What mystifies me with the article is how you determine activity
<br>
in the brain with X-rays?! That sounds like a mistake, but the article
<br>
refers both to fmri and the radiological society, so maybe I'm missing
<br>
something here.

<p>While the concept of the mind as a purely logical and symbol based
<br>
decision system is being eroded at a fast pace, it doesn't mean that we
<br>
are irrational. Rather it shows the *parts* of rational thought, and
<br>
suggests how they might affect the whole system in less rational
<br>
directions when they do not work right or become unbalanced. By knowing
<br>
the limitations of our brains we can figure out ways of getting around
<br>
them.
