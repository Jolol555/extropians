</em><br>

<em>&gt; Which is why the CIA organised a coup in 1953 that ousted a

</em><br>
<p>Sez who? The same people who said that Allende was not a socialist and

the Rosenbergs and Alger Hiss were innocent?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It had a hell of a lot more to do with cheap oil, and taking

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Oh, sure, despite the fact that every fledgling democracy that ever
<br>
bordered the USSR or communist China quickly became subverted by
<br>
communist forces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _That_ particular pigeon came home to roost with a vengeance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 1979 (although the signs suggest that Iran is settling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down again).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, as I have illustrated previously, the anti-US feeling among
<br>
the common people in Iran had far more to do with predatory policies of
<br>
dumping US grain (subsidized, of course, by farm bills written by dems)
<br>
disguised as 'humanitarian aid' on the Iranian market which drove the
<br>
local farm industry into the tank.
<br>
<p>The rantings of some religious nuts would have found no purchase if the
<br>
common  Persian-on-the-street wasn't out of work due to US 'humanitarian
<br>
aid'. Note also that the Ayatollahs did not return to Iran till at least
<br>
6 months after the Shah was booted. The Iranian revolution ran much like
<br>
the Soviet one: a moderate menshevik revolution and broad based
<br>
democratic government overtaken by adherents to a radical
<br>
theology/ideology who brooked no dissent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; These things have to be considered in their historical context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely! And the sad fact is, history as taught in the US appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be about as accurate as the history taught in Japanese or German or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russian schools, or preached in mosques ... i.e., not very.
</em><br>
<p>As opposed to what? The British?
