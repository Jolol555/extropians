<br>
<em>&gt; Feedback from the body qualifies as an experience, AFAIC.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That experience depends on sensory input, again, from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body. As you may have heard, Marvin Minsky is working on an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Emotion Machine&quot; that he believes will supply the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary emotional elements of AI. If we take the sensory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part out of experience, we are left with memories or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial constructs of sensory input. These phantom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences can build emotional renditions of real life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd call these &quot;emotional hallucinations&quot; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences. These emotional hallucinations form perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the majority of what are called &quot;religious experiences&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some people report during (and especially after)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seizures. When we become untethered from real life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, it's possible to deceive ourselves that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imaginary emotional &quot;experiences&quot; are real, when they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually emotional hallucinations. I question the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usefulness of hypotheses about &quot;non-sensory experiences&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which do not include the information that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;experiences&quot; are derived from previous sensory events.
</em><br>
<p>If such an experience were strictly the result of, say, a flood of
<br>
hormones within the brain, I should be able to reproduce the experience
<br>
simply releasing these same hormones in the same amount.  Indeed, there
<br>
is evidence that certain emotional states, particulary mystical
<br>
experiences, can be induced by low-level electromagnetic stimuli applied
<br>
to the brain.  But something seems missing in the &quot;eureka!&quot; case --
<br>
would I have the experience that I'd just made some great discovery even
<br>
though I wasn't thinking about anything in particular?
<br>
<p>Even if we accept that &quot;government&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; are artificial
<br>
constructs of sensory input, these concepts can apparently be
<br>
manipulated without further sensory input to produce new emotional
<br>
states, and even other such constructs.  I find the labeling of these
<br>
constructs and their manipulation-sans-input &quot;emotional hallucinations&quot;
<br>
overly pejorative.  If these experiences can produce insights that may
<br>
be utilized in the external world, they are useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regardless of the direction of transmission, the &quot;eureka!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience (note well the exclamation mark, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant) relies on feedback in the nervous systems of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the organism. If the organism rewards itself with relief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and exhilaration upon solving a problem or discovering a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive pattern, the experience is accompanied by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensations which are, of course, sensory. The exclamation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mark noted by the way you've referred to the &quot;eureka!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, denotes a shouting, celebrative vociferation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This vocalization (or alternatively, silent relief of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tension) provides auditory sensory input (or the sensation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of muscle relaxation, or whatever) to the brain. Hence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-stimulation also qualifies as a sensory event.
</em><br>
<p>So you are willing to accept that there can be experiences that are not
<br>
directly associated with any *external* stimulus, whose direct cause is
<br>
internal (e.g., discovering a conceptual association), so long as we do
<br>
not try to separate the internal cause from the resulting sensory
<br>
experiences?  In that case there doesn't seem much to argue against.  I
<br>
don't know if the biofeedback resulting from an internal cognitive event
<br>
can be separated from the event, or even whether there's any point in
<br>
trying.  But there remains, it seems to me, an important distinction
<br>
between internally- and externally-generated experiences.  I thought
<br>
that was the point of labeling some experiences as &quot;non-sensory&quot; -- to
<br>
indicate that their source was internal rather than external.
