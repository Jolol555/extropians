Perhaps you simply don't like to be lied to (with your permission of course) 
<br>
by grand storytellers? Curiously, enough, Clifford Pickover regularly 
<br>
recommends the works of science-fiction writers like Greg Egan when dealing 
<br>
with Extropian issues. 
<br>
<p>I lurk on Yahoo's Fabric of Reality List, in which Oxford physicist, David 
<br>
Deutsch occasionally, participates. He recommended some science fiction works 
<br>
as well as the Extropian list for issues relating to immortality and 
<br>
cosmology. 
<br>
<p>I tend to like papers that appear at the LANL Archives myself, so give me 
<br>
science or philosophy. There are lots of people can tell stories (bubba 
<br>
meissers), but at some point, one has to hit a peer review level to seem 
<br>
real. Extropianism is either dealing with the 'real' or is merely 
<br>
fantasy-ridden. Time and deliberation and luck of the draw, will tell.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;As I was saying to Damien in private, for some reason, I could never
<br>
read a SF book. I tried a cyberpunk classic (if I understand well)
<br>
some months ago (Gibson, Neuromancer), but it fell from my hands.
<br>
<p>However, I don't think this is because I'm such a risk-taker etc., but
<br>
rather because I like both science and literature, but not the mixing
<br>
of the two.
<br>
<p>I know this is a marginal point of view here, so spare your flames, I
<br>
know how SF can help you to think etc. etc. ;-)  &gt;&gt;
