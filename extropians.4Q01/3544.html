In addition to disease treatment, the sequencing project could open up new
<br>
possibilities that verge on science fiction. The argument is that if there
<br>
is less than 2% difference between chimp and human genes, then that must
<br>
account for everything that makes us human, from our increased intelligence
<br>
to our ability to use language. Comparing sequences will allow us to isolate
<br>
the genes responsible for our &quot;humanness&quot;. Once we know what the genes are,
<br>
we may be able to alter them to give future generations desirable
<br>
characteristics such as improved intelligence.

I argued a similar line in my Ph.D. thesis. I noted too that the pygmy chimp
<br>
has an almost identical code to that of the regular chimp so it would be
<br>
useful to use all three in the investigation. Interestingly, the pygmy chimp
<br>
is not smaller all around but only certain body parts are--suggesting that
<br>
there are genes for controlling the allometric curve for dissociable body
<br>
parts like the brain. Recent discoveries involving homeobox genes have given
<br>
us a plausible mechanism to explain these phenotype difference. The
<br>
following is part of a little ditty I am working on:
<br>
&quot;Homeobox genes control the development of the body plans of a larger number
<br>
of organisms.  For our purposes what is of interest is that there are a
<br>
number of homeobox genes that that control the growth of various brain
<br>
regions.  For example, if you want to make a larger brain in a frog embryo
<br>
simply insert some RNA from the gene X-Otx2 and voilà-you have a frog embryo
<br>
with a larger brain, specifically, the mid and forebrain mass is increased.
<br>
Homeobox genes also come in various forms of generality. Otx2 is obviously
<br>
very general in its scope; in contrast, for example, Emx1 controls the
<br>
growth of the isocortex (one of the two regions of the neocortex). Thus, if
<br>
we believe that intelligence and wisdom might be aided by tweaking
<br>
one area of the brain or another there may be just the right homeobox gene
<br>
for this task.&quot;
<br>
<p>(See P. Holland, P. Ingham, and S. Krauss (1992), &quot;Development and
<br>
Evolution. Mice and flies head to head&quot;, Nature 358, 627-628; and R.
<br>
Finkelstein and E. Boncinelli (1994) &quot;From fly head to mammalian forebrain:
<br>
The story of otd and Otx&quot;, Trends in Genetic 10, 310-315, and Boncinelli,
<br>
E., and A. Mallamaci (1995) &quot;Homeobox genes in vertebrate gastrulation&quot;.
<br>
Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 5, 619-627)
<br>
<p>BTW, I think there are a couple of reasons genetic engineering ought to be
<br>
given more prominence in Transhumanist thinking. First, it is something that
<br>
we could start right after lunch--at least we have the technology, we just
<br>
need the resources and the political will. Imagine if genetic engineering
<br>
smarter persons were taken on with the same sort of political enthusiasm as
<br>
landing men on the moon. I realize that around here genetic engineering is
<br>
not as &quot;sexy&quot; as uploading but it would seem wise not to put all our
<br>
posthuman eggs in one basket. (After all, the claim that humans can create
<br>
an AI is an empirical and falsifiable proposition). Second, my experience
<br>
suggests that when it comes to presenting the Transhumanist case it is
<br>
better in the first instance to discuss concepts like 'posthuman' in meat
<br>
terms. Talk about SIAI requires two conceptual leaps for most people,
<br>
namely, that we can create superintelligence and we can create AI.
