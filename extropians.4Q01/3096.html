I am not sure that I am reasonable, or that it matters to me at this point. 
<br>
The Middle Easterner's problems are that of their own making, and I hold that 
<br>
they use the United States as a scape goat. Your Wahabbi friends, apparently, 
<br>
are aware of this, and fund propaganda, at Islamist Universities, to promote 
<br>
this view, in order to take the heat off their own asses. 
<br>
<p>My guess is the &quot;students&quot; who attend such schools are aware of this, but 
<br>
understanding the cultural sub-text in which they are born and raised, follow 
<br>
along.
<br>
<p>I believe that for public relations reasons, alone, 4 million Afghanis will 
<br>
not starve to death, especially the way the war appears to be going, as you 
<br>
had stated. I also suspect that unless the world cuts back on purchasing 
<br>
Saudi oil, the issue of Islamist international terrorism will continue.
