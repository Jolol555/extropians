</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to include general sentient rights as people become more aware of

</em><br>
<p>AI slavery is less expensive than biological slavery, but if you insist
<br>
that there is any difference whatever between the two, it's easy enough to
<br>
imagine Osama bin Laden biologically cloning seventy-two helpless
<br>
virgins.  From my perspective, these are people too and they have just as
<br>
much claim on my sympathy as you or anyone else.  If it's worth saving the
<br>
world, it's worth saving them too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The important thing to remember about systems like this is that we do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to get everything perfectly right at the first try. Good political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions are flexible and can be adaptive.
</em><br>
<p>1)  This sounds to me like a set of heuristics unadapted to dealing with
<br>
existential risks (and not just the Bangs, either).  Some errors are
<br>
nonrecoverable.  If Robin Hanson's cosmic-commons colonization race turns
<br>
out to be a Whimper, then we had better not get started down that road,
<br>
because once begun it won't stop.
<br>
<p>2)  The cost in sentient suffering in a single non-federation community,
<br>
under the framework you present, could enormously exceed the sum of all
<br>
sentient suffering in history up until this point.  This is not a trivial
<br>
error.
