<p><em>&gt;Yes, apparently there is something you don't know about. They demand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;personal information, including a billing address and credit card
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number before they let you spend more than a certain cutoff amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over the ENTIRE life of your account (i.e. not a $100 cap per
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transaction, but for the whole thing). So basically anonymity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shot. Furthermore, they have a history of freezing accounts for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing more than what they consider to be suspicious patterns of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activity (i.e. transfers in excess of a few grand). That makes them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essentially useless for any sort of high volume business.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What do they get out of bending over for the man and being volunteer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;police whores? Who knows. Maybe they just don't have any guts. Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some sort of legal threat. Maybe simply an informer's fee. Don't know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and if anybody does, please post! Liars need to be exposed.
</em><br>
<p>Paypal is skirting the edges of being a &quot;bank&quot; but not having to comply with 
<br>
all the onerous banking regulations that apply to real banks.  They know 
<br>
that they are already on the government radar screens and could easily be 
<br>
shut down if some bureaucrat decides tomorrow that they have been running a 
<br>
bank in violation of the regulations.  Paypal has a lot to gain from staying 
<br>
on Big Brother's good side.  Not only that, they don't need any hassles from 
<br>
the man while they are planning to go public.  Wired magazine ran a pretty 
<br>
informative article about Paypal a while back.  You can get it at:

<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
