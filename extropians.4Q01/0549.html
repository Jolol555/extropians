<p>I don't see you as flippant at all, this is a good question.
<br>
<p>Such evil people as say Ossama Bin Laden for example, may have had
<br>
many traits we would consider positive before they committed evil
<br>
acts.
<br>
<p>But after such acts any such traits are no longer relevant in my
<br>
accounting. I would never bother to refer to Mr Bin Laden as
<br>
intelligent for example (if he were) and would have no particular
<br>
reason to discuss such, except for military purposes. He is a
<br>
terrorist, a terrorist who is now responsible for thousands of
<br>
innocent deaths (by my accounting) and will now be held accountable
<br>
for his actions.
<br>
<p>Whatever other traits he may possess are irrelevant.
