There are a very few people who are down on my list as &quot;hit them as hard
<br>
as you like, you won't accidentally shatter their psyche&quot;.  Being on that
<br>
list is a deep compliment, and I try very hard to get on others' versions
<br>
of that list.
<br>
<p>Samantha Atkins is on the list.  She can hold her own - against the entire
<br>
list, if necessary - because, like Anders Sandberg and Nick Bostrom... and
<br>
myself... and others... she's made a deliberate study of rationality. 
<br>
Look to your own mental integrity, not to hers.
<br>
<p>I think that many folk here are finding it impossible to distinguish
<br>
between thinking through the issues and taking personal offense at the
<br>
people thinking about them, an absurdity that reached its heights when
<br>
somebody publicly plonked no less than Lee Daniel Crocker - an act of such
<br>
breathtaking audacity that I was almost impressed.  I am disturbed to find
<br>
some of the people I had most respected before this point are falling prey
<br>
to such an elementary mental trap.  Nonetheless asking people to take it
<br>
easy on Samantha is no less audacious than plonking Lee Daniel Crocker.
<br>
<p>I wish people would shut up about people and get back to the issues, not
<br>
because I'm worried about anyone's feelings getting hurt, but because it
<br>
was such an interesting discussion up until then.
