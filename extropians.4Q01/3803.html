<br>
<em>&gt; Even German minimalist (&quot;Ambient&quot;) composers such as Markus Popp (Oval)
</em><br>
and Stefan Betke (Pole) seem to approching texture and
<br>
<em>&gt; structure in a mannerist fashion by self-consciously adding pops, clicks
</em><br>
and glitches.  Of course, this is the trendy present.
<br>
<p>Some would argue that this is no longer the trendy present and has now
<br>
become &quot;yesterday&quot;. As yet I have not been able to get an answer from these
<br>
people as to what is then &quot;today&quot;.
<br>
So then how do people define &quot;new&quot;? I mean how many times do we see
<br>
arguments about who did it first, and is it important? Are we really going
<br>
to hear new sounds or are we going to hear new ways of putting sounds
<br>
together? Or is it new ways of getting sounds?
<br>
Or is it just going to be what the artist says about his music that will
<br>
define its place?
<br>
<p>Earlier in this thread somebody mentioned the replacing of &quot;real&quot; drummers -
<br>
which I do not necessarily disagree with although in my experience it is
<br>
actually 'sometimes' easier to use a real drummer than having to programme
<br>
irregular timing, velocity, etc. I mean imagine sampling the complexity of a
<br>
drum kit and then mapping it - hitting the rim, hitting the centre of the
<br>
skin, a de-tuned kit, various velocities, etc.
<br>
<p>On the most part digitally programmed drums will give you the &quot;perfect&quot;
<br>
sound, etc. But perfect drums sound shit in a rock group. Is it that there
<br>
is a time and place for both? I think so.
<br>
<p>Create a nice day.
<br>
Bricoleur.
<br>
<p>Jeremy Turner - I would love a copy of your interviews. Thanks.
