AI: Artificial Intelligence
<br>

Abstract
<br>
Who will be in charge of whom? How will we decide whether decisions taken by
<br>
machines are morally good or bad? These are questions Steven Spielberg raises,
<br>
but does not really come to grips with in AI: Artificial Intelligence.
<br>
<p>Movies have long dealt with the humanization of machines and the mechanization
<br>
of humans. Fritz Lang's seminal Metropolis (1927) brought us the robot Maria,
<br>
who assumes human form and leads the working classes into revolt against &quot;the
<br>
thinkers.&quot; In Demon Seed (1977), Julie Christie tries (and fails) to avoid
<br>
becoming the surrogate mother of an intelligent computer that becomes driven
<br>
by its desire to procreate. Now, in AI: Artificial Intelligence (directed by
<br>
Steven Spielberg; starring Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law), Spielberg
<br>
investigates the concept of thinking robots at a higher level, but only
<br>
glances at it. Haley Joel Osment is hypnotic as David, who, we are told, is an
<br>
11-year-old boy whose love is real, although he himself is not. Robot David is
<br>
given to a couple whose real son is cryogenically frozen after being comatose,
<br>
and once the unique code words are said to David by his would-be mother, David
<br>
loves his mother without condition. But all goes awry when the real son
<br>
miraculously awakens, comes home, and rejects David, eventually forcing his
<br>
adoptive mother to dump him in the woods, unwittingly into the care of a robot
<br>
male prostitute (Jude Law with a wax finish). With Pinocchio in mind, this
<br>
unlikely synthetic pair heads off to search for the Blue Fairy, who can make
<br>
David, and hopefully his love for Mommy, real.
<br>
<p>AI calls to mind Searle's Chinese Room argument.
<br>
<em>&gt;From a scientific perspective, the film raised, but did not really get to
</em><br>
grips with, the notion of artificial consciousness. This operated at several
<br>
levels in the film: there was Teddy, the apparently indestructible supertoy,
<br>
who gradually revealed more and more unbelievable abilities. An extra large
<br>
dollop of anthropomorphism is clumsily thrown in here, as well as cognitive
<br>
abilities so advanced in Teddy that David didn't seem to represent that much
<br>
of an advance - just the addition of a &quot;love&quot; subroutine. In many ways, AI
<br>
calls to mind Searle's Chinese Room argument: can you ask questions of David
<br>
that will allow you to distinguish whether he is robot or human? When he was
<br>
rejected by Mommy, David's reactions were indistinguishable from those of a
<br>
human child. Or, to pose the question in more emotive terms, how realistic
<br>
does a robot have to be before you become unwilling to switch it off at night?
<br>
In Blade Runner (1981), the question that sorted the men from the robots was
<br>
what they would do if they found an upturned tortoise in the desert. AI takes
<br>
a more subtle approach, but with ultimately the same outcome. The fact that
<br>
Mommy could not bring herself to take David back to the factory to be
<br>
dismantled indicates that she was, by this time, persuaded that he was more
<br>
than a mechanical object. Sophistication is direly lacking in the moral issues
<br>
raised in AI regarding artificial consciousness. There is the portrayal of
<br>
human resistance to all the other robots in the film, in scenes in which a
<br>
quasi-religious group aimed to &quot;rid the earth of artificial life.&quot; Only
<br>
workers in the robot business would be sympathetic to their plight. But the
<br>
real questions here are, Who will be in charge of whom? How will we decide
<br>
whether decisions taken by machines are morally good or morally bad?
<br>
<p>AI's future is heavy-handedly polar.
<br>
Spielberg picked up this story from Stanley Kubrick, who had been developing
<br>
it for some 18 years until his death in 1999. Unlikely bedfellows, Kubrick and
<br>
Spielberg allegedly collaborated on this project for several years. But
<br>
Kubrick's typically misanthropic vision is fully absent. AI's future is
<br>
heavy-handedly polar - good people live in an Ikea world, wooden, chrome, and
<br>
frosted glass: bad guys and robots occupy a kind of fiery neon heavy-metal
<br>
gig. Despite Kubrick's influence, Spielberg can't resist giving in to his
<br>
overwhelming fascination with schmaltz.
<br>
<p>One of Kubrick's most enduring and popular characters was HAL, the
<br>
supercomputer from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), a film that dealt with the
<br>
evolution of consciousness. HAL displayed genuine artificial intelligence, so
<br>
much so, in fact, that his was the most rounded character in 2001, complete
<br>
with massive, murderous flaws. David is not as smart as HAL, and unfortunately
<br>
his love is not real. And this is the fundamental problem with AI. It asks us
<br>
to sympathize with a machine that has no understanding of why or how it has
<br>
emotional cognitive functions in the first place. David's artificially
<br>
intelligent traits are no different from those of Arnold Schwarzenegger's
<br>
cyborg assassin, Terminator: he learns, and copies human behavior and
<br>
emotions. Not many of us felt compassion for that killer.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
