<em>&gt;&quot;Life lives us, not the other way round&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This line triggered some Greek music and dancing thoughts and notes.
<br>
<p>Sometimes when Greeks are full with a high sense of well-being that
<br>
they call &quot;kefi&quot;, they can no longer contain the urge to express
<br>
their satisfaction with life and so they begin to dance. Dancing has
<br>
been integral part of their life from the present time, back to
<br>
ancient times.  They dance it when they are filled with kefi, they
<br>
dance when they are filled with grief. Especially during their 400
<br>
years occupation, small expressions like this was/is a way to hold
<br>
on to sanity in a world with suffering. In the film: Zorba the
<br>
Greek, Zorba, when he is grieving over hs son's death, gets up and
<br>
starts dancing; he said that if he didn't dance at that moment he
<br>
felt that he would surely go mad.
<br>
<p>There are hundreds of Greek dances, women can join in with the men's
<br>
dances, although they are usually performed by men. The dance that
<br>
Anthony Quinn performed in Zorba the Greek is called a &quot;zeibekiko&quot;
<br>
where the dancer's arms are outstretched, resembling the wings of a
<br>
bird (sometimes it is called the dance of the eagle).
<br>
<p>Many of the Greek dances revolve around music from the bouzouki,
<br>
which is a mandolin-like instrument, and the atmosphere of the
<br>
waterfront tavernas would inspire bouzouki music and spontaneous
<br>
dancing.
<br>
<p>In addition to their dances, the Greeks created another form of
<br>
expression, the &quot;rebetika&quot;, which was rooted in the late 1800s and
<br>
came to full form right after WWI. The rebetika is a blend of old
<br>
folk songs, Oriental rhythms, Byzantine hymns, often played on the
<br>
bouzouki, songs which emerged from the deepest levels of urban life:
<br>
waterfront dives, slums, opium and hashish dens. The musicians were
<br>
called Smyrna musicians, and by the mid-1920s this music spread to
<br>
Athens and more respectable cabarets. This music had the most
<br>
profound influence on Greek music last century. Originally the
<br>
lyrics reflected their origin in the dens that produced them: &quot;I am
<br>
a rascal and a bum, and I enter the opium den still high from the
<br>
night before&quot;, then the songs evolved into reflections of their
<br>
dreams, hopes and apprehensions: &quot;The moon is down, the darkness is
<br>
deep, only one man, cannot fall asleep&quot; (this about loneliness).  A
<br>
majority of Greeks at that time (and perhaps since) found their
<br>
'soul' in the music because of a close harmony with the music and
<br>
poetry and bouzouki instrument plus a blending of the musical
<br>
elements of their previous ~500 years history.
<br>
<p>A good description of how the rebetika moved the Greek are these
<br>
words by a Greek composer named Hadjidkis. This is how he felt when
<br>
he heard a rebetika for the first time:
<br>
<p>&quot;Dazed by the grandeur and depth of the melodic phrases, a stranger
<br>
to them, young and without strength, I believed suddenly that the
<br>
song I was listening to was my own, utterly my own story.&quot;
