<p>
Please if you are one who is easily offended by
<br>
blammisphy and silliness, do hit the delete key immediately.
<br>
I have been pre-forgiven by several off-list posters.
<br>
<p>The life and career of Jesus Christ is generally well
<br>
known, but this canardic screed is meant to clear up
<br>
a few historical misunderstandings on the twin
<br>
brother of Jesus, the far more obscure character,
<br>
Hoerkheimer Christ.
<br>
<p>As Jesus began his ministry, Hoerkheimer attempted
<br>
to create his own following, in order to take in some of
<br>
that gold, frankencense and myrrh, especially gold.  But
<br>
it never really took off.  In a blatant example of violation of
<br>
intellectual property rights, Hoerkheimer stole the hymns
<br>
that were being used by his Jesus’ followers, shamelessly
<br>
inserting his own name in place of that of his brother.
<br>
The modified hymns generally failed to catch on however,
<br>
for unknown reasons.
<br>
<p>Hoerkheimer learned early in life that whenever he was with
<br>
Jesus, people would show up bringing gold, frankincense
<br>
and myrrh, for no apparent reason.  After the initial wise
<br>
guys left, Hoerkheimer soon ended up with all the gold.
<br>
The boys rolled and smoked the frankincense as teenagers,
<br>
but the myrrh would not burn.  They never did figure out
<br>
exactly what it was, or what it was for, or why a wise guy
<br>
would actually give it as a gift.  Perhaps it was analogous
<br>
to our modern fruitcake, another curious and useless
<br>
material that has never been chemically identified.
<br>
<p>We do know from various historical reports that myrrh was
<br>
often discussed in the Christ household as the brothers were
<br>
growing up.  Religious historians believe it was some sort
<br>
of a game, perhaps started simply because they liked
<br>
saying the word “myrrh.” In the Christ Brother’s Carpentry
<br>
and Woodworking shop, the discussion would often start as:
<br>
<p>“Hoerkheimer, hast thou seen the myrrh?”
<br>
<p>“Nay, for I hath not seen the myrrh.”
<br>
<p>“Art thou certain, for the myrrh hath disappeared.”
<br>
<p>“Jesus Christ, thou twit!  Verily I hath not taken away the myrrh!”
<br>
<p>“Well, myrrh myrrrrh myrrrrrrrrh!”
<br>
<p>Soon the droogies and other workers in the shop, and even
<br>
the customers would join, exclaiming myrrh, myrrrrh, with various
<br>
silly voices.  Passers-by became quite puzzled at this.
<br>
<p>Although we now know that frankincense is actually
<br>
cense that has been genetically engineered via DNA modification,
<br>
modern biblical scholars still have not the foggiest notion
<br>
what myrrh is.  A field of science is dedicated to unraveling
<br>
this biblical mystery, commonly known as myrrhmecology.
<br>
I would suggest adding the term “myrrh” to the extropian
<br>
terms and definitions list, except of course none of us have
<br>
a clue what that definition actually is.  But I digress.  (I have a
<br>
condition identified by psychiatrists as digressive-repulsive
<br>
behavior. Since this is a disease, with an actual name, I
<br>
therefor am handicapped.  My fond hope is to some day own
<br>
enough money to be considered eccentric, instead of merely
<br>
cracked.)
<br>
<p>Although Jesus was thought to be sinless, he had a
<br>
wicked sense of humor.  The Christ brothers would
<br>
often switch clothing in order to play gags on the dedicated
<br>
followers.  Whenever Jesus needed a break from
<br>
the savior business, Hoerkheimer would often stand in for
<br>
a time.  This worked out fine, except that they were
<br>
doing this switcheroo trick when the Roman soldiers
<br>
showed up, resulting in Hoerkheimer being accidentally
<br>
executed.  When Jesus turned up alive three days later,
<br>
an enormous misunderstanding ensued, the historical
<br>
consequences of which have repercussions to this day.
<br>
Jesus tried to cover his tracks and save the reputation
<br>
of Mary's sister Martha, and the whole story became
<br>
quite tangled.
<br>
<p>This too begs an explanation.  It is often said that the
<br>
New Testament is very puzzling in that the words of
<br>
Jesus often sound as if spoken by two different persons.
<br>
The fact is the words actually were spoken by two different
<br>
persons, thus explaining such curious juxtapositions
<br>
as John 14:27 “Peace I leave with you, my peace I
<br>
give unto you,” (Jesus, for sure) and Matthew 10:34
<br>
“Think not that I am come to send peace on earth:
<br>
I came not to send peace, but a sword,” (pure Hoerkheimer).
<br>
It is a well known fact that Jesus was actually a very
<br>
gentle, nice guy, but that Hoerkheimer Christ was a
<br>
son of a bitch.
<br>
<p>That two siblings should be so similar in appearance
<br>
yet so different in character should come as no surprise,
<br>
as illustrated by our own Newstrom brothers, Harvey
<br>
and Louis.  Today we even have a specific term for
<br>
such situations: “evil twin.”  Amara Graps and I are
<br>
each others evil twins.  So similar are we in appearance
<br>
that we are indistinguishable even by our friends and closest
<br>
parents.  At Extro5 we switched places several times, and
<br>
no one even noticed.  But I digress.
<br>
<p>The sermon on the mount was classic Jesus.  But that
<br>
little overturning of the moneychangers tables incident
<br>
in Matthew 21:12 was pure Hoerkheimer.  He had been
<br>
smoking frankincense, and his judgment was compromised.
<br>
That whole money-changers tables caper in fact eventually
<br>
led to the hapless Hoerkheimer’s untimely demise.  When the
<br>
Roman authorities came to arrest Jesus, the actual charge was
<br>
failure to pay liquor taxes on that wine that he had made
<br>
from water at the wedding in Cana nearly four years
<br>
previously (John 2:7).  He failed to mention that value-
<br>
added miracle on his tax return, even though there was
<br>
clearly profit expected in the creation of wine from water.
<br>
Then as now, you don't mess with the IRS.  Also then
<br>
as now, the wheels of government grind slow, but they
<br>
grind fine.
<br>
<p>While Jesus was out of town (and Martha Magdalena
<br>
was also conspicuously absent) Hoerkheimer was
<br>
mistaken for his brother and hauled before the magistrates.
<br>
The authorities gave him a mock trial, again in an eerily
<br>
familiar precedent to the way the IRS works today.  They
<br>
were content to let him go with the 39 lashes from the
<br>
cat-o-nine-tails, confiscation of the carpentry shop and
<br>
all his other worldly goods, but the crowd insisted upon
<br>
his crucifixion.  They recognized Hoerkheimer as the
<br>
bastard who had dumped their money changing tables
<br>
at the temple, and they were still highly incensed about
<br>
that whole incident.  At their insistence Hoerkheimer
<br>
was slain.
<br>
<p>Peter was in on the plan for letting Jesus have a few
<br>
days off.  This explains his comment when Hoerkheimer
<br>
was being led away, in Matthew 26:74, “Then he [Peter]
<br>
began to curse and swear, saying I know not the man.”
<br>
I trust you grok what they mean in the bible when they
<br>
use the term “know,” in that gentle, delicate 17th century
<br>
English way of speaking.  Consider Genesis 4:1, “and
<br>
Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived.”
<br>
<p>When the crucifixion of Hoerkheimer Christ was taking
<br>
place, his last words were also misunderstood by the
<br>
reporters, perhaps because of his southern accent.  Recall
<br>
that the Christ brothers were from Nazareth, which is in
<br>
the south of Galilee.  Thus the accent alluded to in Matthew
<br>
26:73 “...thy speech betrayeth thee...”  We recognize that
<br>
all the great preachers have southern accents.  Jimmy
<br>
Swaggart. Billy Graham. Martin Luther King, Jim and
<br>
Tammy Bakker, Oral Roberts, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson,
<br>
all of the biggie Christian preachers with high standing in the
<br>
church speak earnest southern.  Today if a minister wants
<br>
to go anywhere at all, he must manufacture a southern accent
<br>
even if he is not actually from the south.  An example is
<br>
Reverend Lovejoy from the Simpsons, who was actually
<br>
born in Springfield.  So this southern accent tradition goes
<br>
all the way back to the boss, who had the old Nazareth-in-
<br>
the-south-of-Galilee going for him.  As did his brother
<br>
Hoerkheimer, of course.
<br>
<p>As he was perishing upon the cross at the hands of the
<br>
Romans, Mark 15:34 reports that Hoerkheimer was
<br>
heard to say “My god my god, why hast thou forsaken me?”
<br>
translated from the words “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani.”
<br>
He actually said “Oy vey, Y’all, thou done got the wrong guy!”
<br>
The two phrases do sound a lot alike.
<br>
<p>I hope I have cleared up a few misunderstandings.  My
<br>
sincerest hope is that on this Newtonmass eve, each of
<br>
you find in the bible the truth that you seek, such as what
<br>
in the hell is myrrh.
