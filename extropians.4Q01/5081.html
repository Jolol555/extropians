On Mon, 24 Dec 2001, Anders Sandberg, commenting on my comments wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You misunderstand what &quot;created equal&quot; is supposed to mean. You interpret the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement in strictly biological terms, and then it of course becomes wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the writers of the above document did most certainly *not* think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polymorphisms or skin color, they were basing this on *ethical* equality.
</em><br>
<p>I'll offer a voice as an individual with an &quot;American&quot; education (vs.
<br>
perhaps a European education).  When we are educated in America and
<br>
U.S. History is the subject -- in 8th grade if I recall so one is ~14 yrs
<br>
old -- &quot;ethics&quot; is not part of the discussion.  Ethics comes up perhaps
<br>
when one takes philosophy classes in High School or College.  I cannot
<br>
recall a situation in my education when the Declaration of Independence
<br>
was discussed from an &quot;ethical&quot; perspective.  So while I may agree with
<br>
Anders comments, I strongly question whether the average American
<br>
perceives them as Anders does.
<br>
<p>What does the average American perceive?  Well, if I use the period from
<br>
perhaps 1960-1985(?), a significant part of the economic foundation of
<br>
the U.S. was the graduated income tax -- if you had more you paid more.
<br>
(Also the situation in Sweeden and many other countries I believe).
<br>
Now, this was justified to the average American citizen on the &quot;Robin Hood&quot;
<br>
principle.  The government would take from the rich and give to the poor.
<br>
This generated the &quot;welfare&quot; state, affirmative action, quota hiring
<br>
and a host of other policies designed to correct perceptions of &quot;injustices&quot;.
<br>
<p>Given my background and education (typical middle-class American) it
<br>
was completely &quot;reasonable&quot; that one should be taking from the rich
<br>
and giving to the poor because that would result in everyone being
<br>
&quot;equal&quot; (just like it said in the founding documents for our country).
<br>
[If you look back into the &quot;town meeting&quot; tradition of government,
<br>
particularly in New England, there is a constant thread that everyone
<br>
should have an &quot;equal&quot; voice.  There is environmental pressure that
<br>
everyone *should* be &quot;equal&quot;.]  
<br>
<p>Only since the mid-'80's and the Regan driven simplifications to
<br>
the tax code, does there seem to be some reversal of the Robin Hood
<br>
principle.  The debate still continues today when one sees articles
<br>
regarding the salary of corporate CEOs vs. their employees or the
<br>
divide between the richest vs. the poorest in a society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't take it wrong, but your engineering perspective makes you miss a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference that is glaringly obvious to anyone involved in philosophy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially political philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>Anders, Anders, Anders... the *average* person has virtually no education
<br>
in &quot;philosophy&quot; (at least here in America).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; since a lot of the formulations in the Extropian Principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarly has to be understood in terms of a long humanist and liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradition. If you do not place them in a larger philosophicl context they do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not really make much sense.
</em><br>
<p>Then they aren't going to make much sense to *most* people.
<br>
According to the U.S. Census Dept. the 20-24 age group (Y2000) is
<br>
18.6 million people (~3.7 m people at each age) and according to the
<br>
Dept. of Education (<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/proj01/tables/table27.asp">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2001/proj01/tables/table27.asp</a>)
<br>
the number of college graduates in Y2000 is ~1.2 million (~32%).
<br>
<p>The only Americans who understand &quot;humanist&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; traditions
<br>
are probably those who have a college education and those who study
<br>
these areas (philosophy &amp; pol sci majors).  So you are now down to
<br>
less than ~10%, more likely &lt; 5% of the population.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What they really talk about here is that every human has an equal inherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human dignity, the inherent value of being a human being living a life on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's own terms and with one's own goal. From this axiom follows inalienable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights such as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  There is an intuitive self-referential argument that one would
<br>
want everyone to have equal opportunities because you would also like
<br>
to have those opportunities oneself.
<br>
<p>But the devil is in the details -- if one buys off on the concept that
<br>
everyone has &quot;equal dignity&quot;, then one should buy off on the idea that
<br>
everyone should have equal starting conditions.  So, the human social
<br>
environment should be exactly like &quot;horse racing&quot; -- where one handicaps
<br>
the horses with greater inherent advantages to make the race an exercise
<br>
in fairness (more ethical?) rather than one where one simply selects
<br>
those with the greatest gene set (natural selection).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; As for racism, devaluing somebody's dignity because of their genome or culture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is clearly against this concept of humans as self-developing, self-directing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals in themselves.  You can of course dislike a person or group of person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on what they do or think, but that should never remove the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognition of their basic human dignity.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but to what extent should each independent actor be obligated (coerced?)
<br>
into compensating for the genetic or cultural disadvantages that specific
<br>
individuals are dealt?
<br>
<p>Robert
