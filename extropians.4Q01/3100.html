<em>&gt; &gt; You needn't stretch to find worse US parallels.  Dresden, Hiroshima,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and Nagasaki were all straight-up terrorist acts - trying to force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action onto governments/societies by killing civilians in areas of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minimal military importance.
</em><br>
<p>Dresen, certainly, because the war was pretty much already over
<br>
and it didn't accomplish anything but a sense of retribution,
<br>
which I agree isn't as effective in international relations as
<br>
it might be in interpersonal ones.
<br>
<p>But Hiroshima and Nagasaki were different: at the time, there
<br>
was no reason to belive the war wouldn't continue for a long
<br>
time, at the cost of many thousands of lives.  A show of
<br>
devastating, overwhelming, terrifying force against an enemy
<br>
that was clearly the agressor, leaving him no choice but total
<br>
unconditional surrender, accomplished exactly the right goal:
<br>
war over, lives saved, no questions.  I have a lot of sympathy
<br>
for folks who argue for restraint in the use of force in most
<br>
cases, and I think many of our own uses of force were unjustified.
<br>
But Hiroshima and Nagasaki were that exceptional case, and
<br>
were the right thing to do at the right time.
