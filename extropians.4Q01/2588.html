Samantha Atkins a écrit (12.11.2001/15:36) :
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thanks for the info. That's certainly good (I couldn't find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; translated transcripts of the interviews with Google though). I still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that something that lasts could be useful. Words said on TV are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; readily wiped out by persuasion from people present in your physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And answering (hostile) questions is not the same as freely choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to introduce yourself in some way. Something that all could refer to,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and discuss ; and that Americans would somehow endorse, too (compare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with talks of diplomats we don't even know about). Something a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deeper, broader...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I heard some Afghanis were actually convinced by the Talibans that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; food dropped by US airplanes was poisonned, and starved to death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instead of eating it...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I very much doubt this last as many of the Afghanis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are now at the point of ruining their stomachs eating grass they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are so hungry.  The truth is that not nearly enough food is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to prevent the deaths of millions.  And no, it is not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not just, the fault of the Taliban.  The country has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ravaged by war and various repressive regimes for 3 decades. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its agricultural and economic understructure is a total shambles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and was even before the bombing.  The vast majority of food aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to come by truck convoy from Pakistan.  We stopped those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convoys on or around September 16.  The food packets we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dropped have been only a drop in the bucket of what is needed if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions are to avoid death by starvation, malnutrion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunistic disorders as a result of that and/or exposure.   
</em><br>
<p><p>I know about that.
<br>
<p>The example was to point the depth of the misconceptions that people
<br>
of the Arab nations can entertain about the US, and how you can easily
<br>
convince them of how evil and malevolent the US are.
<br>
<p>It was not to say : ah, if only they would take this food, that would
<br>
solve all the problems...
<br>
<p>YOU know that it's not likely that the US drop poisonned food to kill
<br>
the Afghans. But they don't seem to know it for sure. That's the surprise.
<br>
<p>I do think, and made the experience in a dialogue a few weeks ago,
<br>
that misconceptions of the US' intentions (whatever their wrongs, and
<br>
you did insist on them very much already here) are very deep in the
<br>
Arab public.
<br>
<p>And that something should be done about it.
