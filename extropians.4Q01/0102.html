<p><p><em>&gt; Yes on both here too, and I'm a good subject since I tend to get sick as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dog on long trips unless I'm flying the plane or driving the car.  Having
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones don't cause drowsiness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would I not get sick if I'm driving the car or flying the plane? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder if there's a theory on that. Looking straight ahead helps. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get sick as easily riding as a passenger in the front seat as I do riding in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the back. But that's not the whole answer, because I do get sick sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a front seat passenger.

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have exactly the same problem, as many do, If i'm not driving, I get 
<br>
sick. I also travel long distance by train and absolutely cannot face 
<br>
backwards. I cant comment on having the shades down on a plane as I always 
<br>
have my face pressed up against the glass marveling at the world below ( 
<br>
flying never fails to impress me).
<br>
<p>A couple of things I have noticed about travel sickness are that if the 
<br>
vehicle i'm in is subject to high frequency vibrations, I dont get sick but 
<br>
when the vibration is low ( Like the lurching in a plane) I get sick very 
<br>
quickly. This has always been a big problem on Buses and coaches due to the 
<br>
constant low vibration from the engine when the vehicle is stationary at 
<br>
lights or junctions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noticed an odd effect when driving. Sometimes I become 
<br>
acutely aware of the rearview mirror, this gives the effect of driving 
<br>
forwards but traveling backwards which is an instant stomache turner. But I 
<br>
dont get the same effect when looking in the mirror. Very strange, But  I 
<br>
think it highlights the pyschological basis of motion sickness.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddly I never get travel sick when i'm drunk especially if i'm driving 
<br>
(just kidding)
<br>
So if the seats in a plane are facing backwards I think i'd have to resort to 
<br>
a bottle of Jack D' to get me through the trip.
