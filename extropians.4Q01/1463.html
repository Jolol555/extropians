<p>It is WRONG.  Do you belief for a minute that the precedent will
<br>
not be applied to US citizens suspected of aiding and abetting
<br>
terrorists?  Especially when what that label can be applied to
<br>
is currently ultra-fuzzy?  How about a bit of torture of mere
<br>
suspects while we are about it?  Do you think it is open season
<br>
on &quot;non-citizens&quot; just because of 9-11?  Would you like the same
<br>
treatment when you go abroad?  Would you like this treatment on
<br>
mere suspicion without legal counsel?  The day that the US
<br>
government uses such methods is the day it becomes my sworn
<br>
enemy.
