</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Can you give any examples of nation-building working?  What exactly do
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mean by it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Post-WWII.  Marshall Plan.  Germany.  Japan.  You know, those two highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrialized liberal democracies, allies of the USA, that used to be our
</em><br>
<p>Our?  I don't recall you and I being there...
<br>
<p>Also, the remains the argument put by forth by Thomas Fleming (in _The New
<br>
Dealers' War_) and others (e.g., John T. Flynn and Robert B. Stinnett) that
<br>
FDR did his best to manipulate Japan and Germany (his real target)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; blood enemies sixty years ago?
</em><br>
<p>First off, the Marshall Plan was not nation building, but wealth transfer
<br>
mainly justified to fight against Communism.  (The way the war was
<br>
prosecuted by the US kind of wiped out any potential balance in Europe and
<br>
Asia against the Soviets.  As Paul Seabury and Angelo Codevilla note in
<br>
their _War: Ends and Means_, people going to war should always do so to win
<br>
a better peace.  War should not be just about beating up the enemy, but
<br>
mainly about the long run -- the time after the war is over.)
<br>
<p>Second, from reading _The Fourth and Richest Reich: How the Germans
<br>
Conquered the Postwar World_ by Edwin Hartrich several years ago, I got the
<br>
impression that the Marshall Plan was not as successful.  The deciding
<br>
factor in nations springing back from war was mostly what internal policies
<br>
they decided to implement.  Notably, [West] Germany built itself back up,
<br>
while Italy (and Greece) remained basket cases.
<br>
<p>To add weight to this &quot;internal policy&quot; argument, it's notable that it was
<br>
only after both West Germany and Japan shook off a lot of the continued
<br>
economic interventions from the US and other Allies that their economies
<br>
started to take off.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
