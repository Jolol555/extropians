It is part of the culture. If I took the bribes for grades I was offered I
<br>
could have retired a wealth man. You are talking a state university and
<br>
bribes for grades ranges up to the 5 figure levels.
<br>
<p>You slap them on the hand and tell them this is just not done in the University.
<br>
In reality, a lot did not know that.

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Its an economic

<em>&gt;&gt; Are you sure?  He calls them &quot;corrupt&quot; but that doesn't mean the same

<em>&gt;No, he is right (though you are too). There has been an ongoing brouhaha
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over the amount of skimming and kickbacks that occur on projects in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Kingdom. Generally it is widely accepted that at least 10-20% of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;public expenditures are spent on bribes, kickbacks, skimming, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;financial peccadillos of the Sauds, the bin Ladens (Usama's brothers),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and other elite scions of the ruling families in the Kingdom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That they get away with such un-muslim activities within the kingdom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without being struck down by Allah certainly emboldens them to set aside
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proper Wahhabi habits when in the west. Both are part and parcel of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same corruption.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One of the reasons that many saudi scions are pissed at the US presence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that part of the deal of our forces being based in the Kingdom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;included a concession that support of US operations would involve no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kickbacks, bribes, etc. which they think they have a right to.
