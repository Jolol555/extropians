<em>&gt; Spike writes, regarding firing shots into the air:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the event of such an attack, I figure a five hundred proles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; squeeze off 10 rounds each to accumulate about a 50% chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a score, so we should expect about 5 deaths and 10 injuries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by falling bullets per shootfest.  Let us hope it never comes to this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The article goes on to say that this is fast enough to penetrate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skin and potentially cause serious injury.  But I doubt that you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill someone hitting them on the top of the head with a bullet going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only this fast.  Hal
</em><br>
<p>Drooges, there was a little girl killed by a falling bullet in San Jose a
<br>
couple
<br>
years ago.  The proles fire guns skyward at midnight on New Years.
<br>
In the dozen years I have lived here, this is the first death.  I intended
<br>
my estimate to be conservative (pessimistic) but after I posted I
<br>
thought of several reasons why my number would be more than
<br>
an order of magnitude too pessimistic.  One of those is the point
<br>
you mention Hal.  Another is that most of the proles would be
<br>
indoors or in a car, which would be sufficient to shield.  Another
<br>
is that my neighborhood is denser than most, as I and my
<br>
neighbors are shall we say, capital challenged.  Another
<br>
is the 30 by 30 cm square fatal region is probably pessimistic
<br>
by a factor of at least 20 by itself: probably more than 6 or 7
<br>
cm diameter region of possibly deadly area, this being on the
<br>
top of the head, and even then most likely would apply only
<br>
to something really heavy like rifled shotgun slugs.  A typical
<br>
falling small caliber rifle bullet would likely have an insufficient
<br>
ballistic coefficient to slay.  I revise my estimate to a death by
<br>
falling bullet being about as likely as downing the attacking aircraft,
<br>
which is to say, un.
