Interesting case developing in Australia right now. 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,3487370%255E27">http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,3487370%255E27</a>

<p>A couple carrying a deleterious allele had a kid suffering a gruesome
<br>
condition, Fanconi's anemia. He can possibly be saved with stem cells from
<br>
a histocompatible source; the plausible candidate is placental cord stem
<br>
cells from a new sibling. So the parents are petitioning for the right to
<br>
use IVF technology to prepare a number of in vitro blastocytes, screen them
<br>
to remove those with the genetical anomaly, then implant a healthy one. In
<br>
due course, they'll have another child spared the disorder, and his or her
<br>
cord blood will provide the cure for the existing dying child. 
<br>
<p>TV news reports of this issue are speaking of the proposal as `genetic
<br>
engineering' (rather than, say, screening for healthy embryos). Monash's Dr
<br>
Alan Trounson is wearily for it, but you can see the poor fellow tiring
<br>
under the ceaseless barrage. It doesn't seem to occur to the nitwits that
<br>
*no* alterations are being proposed in the new baby's genome.
<br>
<p>Naturally the reporters all babble about `playing god' and `feeling revolted'.
<br>
<p>I think this mischievous, or maybe just ignorant, misuse of words needs to
<br>
be combatted every time it arises. Of course, maybe it's better to let it
<br>
run unchecked... because then by the time people *are* doing real genetic
<br>
engineering, the boy will have cried wolf so often everyone will be
<br>
heartily sick of the silly noise.
