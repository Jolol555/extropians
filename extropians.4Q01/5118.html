<p>Yeah, true. Would be better to say something like &quot;produce an embryo.&quot;

<p>But short term may be *really* short; long term might not be all that far
<br>
away, given the accelerating rate of technological advance (as you've
<br>
pointed out in *The Spike*). And, selfishly, I'm concerned about medical
<br>
procedures that will help me and my grown child rather than only procedures
<br>
that would be useful for people whose parents are (or possibly who are
<br>
themselves) still of childbearing age. We need to take every opportunity to
<br>
address the basic issues, one of the most important being the definition of
<br>
human.
<br>
<p>The US Supreme Court abortion decision Roe v.Wade has always been
<br>
vulnerable, because it didn't adequately deal with basic issues such as the
<br>
legal definition of human.
<br>
<p>I believe there are, or have been in the course of human existence, cultures
<br>
that define a child as human only after it reaches a certain age, say one
<br>
year after birth. Also, I think defining embryos as human, as a significant
<br>
subset of our culture does, is peculiar. I don't think most people realize
<br>
how arbitrary the dividing line between human and pre-human is. Seems as
<br>
though this arbitrary dividing line is the most difficult hurdle to overcome
<br>
in assuring ourselves that we'll have access to the medical procedures we'll
<br>
need to extend our lifespans.
<br>
<p>Maybe neuroscience can help here by showing what cognitive processes are
<br>
possible at each stage of embryonic and fetal development?
<br>
<p>I don't think one can hope to change the minds of true believers, at least
<br>
not without some sort of mass, illogical crusade. But it seems feasible to
<br>
educate more open-minded people. There has been some discussion on the list
<br>
about how little most people know about philosophy. But most people know, or
<br>
can imagine, what it's like to face losing someone they love.
