There have been many studies of prayer; if you do enough studies some will 
<br>
come up significant
<br>
and get published.  Nobody would publish a study showing prayer is 
<br>
ineffective (they will if
<br>
there's a significant claim out that it's effective, but not now).  The 
<br>
elaborate scheme of this
<br>
study (group a prays for the patients, group b prays for a, group c prays for 
<br>
a and b) very
<br>
strongly suggests at least 2-3 negative studies in the file drawer.  The 
<br>
first experiment would
<br>
be group a only; a negative result would probably get repeated; then you 
<br>
might add b, then
<br>
c.
<br>
<p>The observed difference is large compared to psi experiments because the 
<br>
groups are small.
<br>
With small groups and binary outcomes huge differences are expected by chance 
<br>
(remember,
<br>
there's multiple studies and the published ones are the best).  In psi  
<br>
experiments you can 
<br>
repeat ad nauseam and the law of large numbers gets rid of the large 
<br>
deviations.
