<p>I think thats &quot;natural&quot; systems.  I've seen discussions that
<br>
suggest that in photobioreactors you may be able to get up to 8-9%.

<p>Its entirely a infrastructure cost issue.  You can (a) invest in
<br>
self-replicating &quot;natural&quot; systems that will reproduce themselves
<br>
with very little investment (other than upfront engineering
<br>
costs) or you can build more and more solar collector factories that
<br>
you are going to be little used in the long term.  The self-replicator
<br>
approach is *much* faster and cheaper than the factory building approach.
<br>
<p>In the long run, building the factories makes sense (actually building
<br>
the factory that builds the factories is what really makes sense),
<br>
but in the short run it may be much more efficient to go with pseudo-natural
<br>
systems at a poor 4% efficiency and take the money you save in so doing
<br>
and dedicate it to designing the factory for the factories for the highly
<br>
efficient long-lived solar cells.
<br>
<p>You ultimately want a self-repairing system that can repair or replace
<br>
parts damaged by UV.  Until those are designed into solar cells the
<br>
natural systems may have certain low maintenance cost advantages.
