Omron ready to test demand for robo-cat
<br>

<br>
Is there a market for a pet robot which serves no practical purpose? Following
<br>
in Sony's paw prints, Omron Corp. will introduce a limited-edition robot cat
<br>
with &quot;fur&quot; for more than $1,500, a price and marketing strategy comparable to
<br>
that of Sony's Aibo robot line.
<br>
<p>The robot, named Necoro - neko, or &quot;cat&quot; in Japanese, + communication +
<br>
robot - is modeled after a typical American feline. Like Sony's pet robots,
<br>
Necoro does nothing useful. It just communicates with its &quot;owner&quot; in a cat's
<br>
manner. It is about the same size and weight as a real cat, but it does not
<br>
walk.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sensing and control technology are Omron's core competence technologies. We
<br>
developed Necoro as a combination of these technologies and a human/machine
<br>
interface,&quot; said Hideki Masuda, executive vice president acting as senior
<br>
general manager of Omron Business Development Group.
<br>
<p>Necoro has tactile sensors in the head, chin and back. A microphone is built
<br>
into the head, and an image sensor is built into a nose hole. Two
<br>
accelosensors and one auxiliary sensor detect its position. It grows
<br>
emotionally, depending on how it is treated by its owners. Patting it softly
<br>
or hitting it will yield different behaviors.
<br>
<p>Omron plans to market the cat robot in Japan first at about $1,530, with sales
<br>
limited to 5,000 units. The pricing and limited-edition strategy resembles
<br>
Sony's marketing for Aibo. Though the marketing plan is similar, &quot;Necoro has
<br>
fur,&quot; said Toshihiro Tashima, project leader of E. Pet-Project at Omron
<br>
Business Development Group. &quot;Touching is the first communication, so the fur
<br>
is essential. We want to pursue how close Necoro can be to a real cat,&quot; said
<br>
Tashima.
<br>
<p>Sony has previously offered robots that resemble dogs, but they were not
<br>
realistic. Even Tashima, the robot development leader at Omron, admitted that
<br>
it is difficult to make a robot like a living cat. That halfway resemblance
<br>
may strike some people as incongruous, some analysts said.
<br>
<p>Omron had announced the first cat robot prototype in September 1998. &quot;At that
<br>
time, we used [Hitachi's] SH3 RISK CPU. The CPU used for this model is a lower
<br>
level CPU, compared to the SH3.&quot;
<br>
<p>Omron did not disclose details of the Necoro. But the basic configuration is
<br>
apparently based on existing technology and components. Omron has not designed
<br>
any new LSIs for the robot. Omron currently uses a simple, proprietary
<br>
operating system. &quot;For a large robot or a walking robot, a high-speed CPU
<br>
would be needed, but Necoro does not require such a CPU,&quot; Tashima said. &quot;If
<br>
Sony's Open-R becomes a de facto standard, we won't hesitate to support it.
<br>
But it has not opened enough,&quot; said Tashima.
<br>
<p>Since the first prototype, Omron engineers have been building up the Mind and
<br>
Consciousness (MaC) model. In it, recognition and emotion are fed to each
<br>
other to generate behavior. Necoro has six emotional expressions and 48 cat
<br>
sounds linked with emotion. It has a total of 15 joints. Two for each leg, two
<br>
for the tail and two for the neck. Eyelids, ears and a mouth each have one
<br>
degree of movement. &quot;If we add one more joint to each leg, it can walk. But we
<br>
wanted to focus on communication for this model,&quot; said Tashima.
<br>
<p>Sales begin Nov. 20. The company has partnered with one department store,
<br>
which will exhibit and sell the product at seven branch stores. Orders will
<br>
also will be accepted online.
<br>
<p>At first, Omron plans to offer Necoro only in Japan, as the &quot;support system in
<br>
overseas markets is not ready,&quot; said Masuda.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
