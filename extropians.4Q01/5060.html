<p><em>&gt; However, it is a proven fact that for every 1% increase in the law

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'd be interested to read about this 'proven fact' - do you have a
<br>
reference? Presumably your 'proven fact' only applies specifically to US
<br>
society where it is legal to own a handgun (unlike the UK, where it is not -
<br>
any more).
<br>
<p>I am not an expert on the gun control debate; but I do know enough to know
<br>
that there are far too many people on either side making dramatic claims
<br>
about what has been 'proven'; often without much factual evidence. I suggest
<br>
that we should stick to hard evidence and reference this discussion, or it
<br>
will degenerate into meaningless political posturing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, the 'innocent until proven guilty' standard cannot apply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals immigrating. Those wishing to travel to our open society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from societies with much lower standards of trust must be held up to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher standard of behavior.
</em><br>
<p>Pretty shocking stuff. You're advocating an 'open society'; but one which at
<br>
the same time, routinely practices discrimination on the basis of country of
<br>
birth and where all are not equal under the eyes of the law. I believe this
<br>
undermines virtually all the principles on which the United States was
<br>
founded. You're saying that - after gaining permission to reside in the US -
<br>
that some citizens are more equal than others; and more shocking than that,
<br>
that some citizens should not be deemed innocent of crimes until proven
<br>
guilty. 
<br>
<p>I am new to the extropian list, but judging from some of the themes explored
<br>
on the other threads, I believe that this would be a position that would be
<br>
profoundly and totally rejected by most transhumanists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; because, as we have seen, the worst such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies do not generally cooperate with our immigration authorities in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determining who is trustworthy or not (especially in the case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals who are members of state sponsored terrorist groups).
</em><br>
<p>Your argument has moved on. Previously you argued that individuals violated
<br>
their immigration status; now you're suggesting that this deception of the
<br>
INS is aided and abetted by foreign states. What evidence do you have to
<br>
support this assertion?
