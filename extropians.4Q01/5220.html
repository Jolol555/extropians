I have had similar ideas, and I think they make a lot of sense. Sure, there
<br>
is a lot of devils lurking in the details to think of when designing
<br>
scenarios like this, and the problem of getting there from here.
<br>
<p>As I see it, what is really needed for this to function is a kind of
<br>
constitution/operating system for inter-community relations. This is the
<br>
area currently called international law, although it is not obvious what
<br>
the likely or optimal size of the communities would be and whether current
<br>
international or national laws could be extended to them, or if an entirely
<br>
new level of the legal system is needed. The proposed system clearly needs
<br>
some agreed on rules, but it seems that to make it practical they have to
<br>
be as minimalist and simple as possible. Compare this to my earlier
<br>
discussions of having a minimalist universal ethics in a society to
<br>
guarantee rights, with the ethics of individual put on top of this; in this
<br>
case the inter-community constitution would be similar to the minimalist
<br>
ethics and mainly deal with guaranteeing the rights of people and
<br>
communities, but not prescribing their internal structure - that is left to
<br>
their internal rules.
<br>
<p>Can this kind of system emerge? I think so. I don't think many states will
<br>
voluntarily divide into this kind of system, even if there are some
<br>
examples of giving subcultures and ethnicities greater autonomy. A more
<br>
likely path of development would be the current increase in the creation of
<br>
small states and quasi-independent zones. This way international law can be
<br>
used for bootstrapping working relationships, but clearly it won't just
<br>
happen by itself: there is a need to create multilateral treaties (and not
<br>
just a mess of bilateral ones and wordy biased UN proclamations) that lead
<br>
in this direction, a need to counteract the increasing attempts to stop
<br>
people from moving freely around, attempts to bind together regions into
<br>
firmer superstates (which are the exact opposite of this suggested system -
<br>
the EU seems to try to make the member states more similar than trying to
<br>
make interfacing between them easier) and of course an understanding that
<br>
such a &quot;federation of communities&quot; is a better system than the current
<br>
anarchy of states. 
<br>
<p>There isn't any need to try this across the entire world at once, but it
<br>
can be started on a relatively small scale and then develop (both by more
<br>
communities/nations joining, and possibly by the creation of smaller
<br>
sub-communities if it appears promising locally). There could even be
<br>
different approaches to how the &quot;federations&quot; would be constituted, and we
<br>
could see what worked best.
