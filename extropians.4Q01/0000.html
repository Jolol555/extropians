</em><br>
<p>Well now wait a minute.  I would suspect a poison gas attacker would
<br>
fly low, but even if he is only 200 meters up that would still give you time to
<br>
squeeze off a 10 round magazine before having to scamper indoors and
<br>
hope for the best.  I envision we might have a few minutes advance warning
<br>
from a television news report or something.  So what is the density of
<br>
sarin gas?  If someone knows the chemical formula, I can estimate how
<br>
long you have to fire before the stuff could reach you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Should we all go and buy gasmasks, or even full biohazard suits?
</em><br>
<p>Why not?  If you have a few bucks to spare it might be a good investment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And walking around in such garb with a rifle slung over my shoulder could give people reason to panic...
</em><br>
<p>It shouldn't.  They would know why you were doing it, in the event of
<br>
an attack.  Most rifles are perfectly legal even in Taxifornia.  Whenever
<br>
there is a right-to-bear-arms  demonstration around here, one often sees
<br>
guys milling around with elephant guns slung over the shoulder, as there
<br>
are never any laws against those.  I assume anything up to but not
<br>
including an M60 is legal here.  Perhaps Mike Lorrey knows.
<br>
<p>I took a ride over to the local sporting goods store today and found
<br>
that I can get a cheapy 30 aught six for about 250 bucks.  There are
<br>
plenty of WW2 vintage weapons available there for about 100, which
<br>
look like they would serve this application perfectly.  I didnt pick one
<br>
out.  I still wanna see if I can find tracers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And what if you shoot down the plane thinking you are alright, when in fact you have been exposed to a horrible disease like anthrax?
</em><br>
<p>Well, see ya, its been fun.  This *is* war, after all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think for any cryonicists among us, it could be a smart move to keep a big vat of liquid nitrogen in the garage.
</em><br>
<p>You do bring up an interesting point.  If a bunch of people were infected
<br>
with something, I wonder if the cryonicists might pull a wad of cash outta
<br>
their bank accounts and drive down to Phoenix and show up at the door
<br>
of Alcor with a week's notice of needing their services.  Would they be
<br>
able to handle 10 of us?  20?  What if we had something infectious?  Would
<br>
we be turned away?  spike
