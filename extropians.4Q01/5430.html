*** &quot;Archaelogical&quot; evidence we are posthuman already! ***
<br>
Recent research conducted at the University of Tennessee shows that
<br>
the increase of height in human skeletons over the last 100 years is
<br>
only the tip of an iceberg. If a C19th skeleton dug up in the future was
<br>
compared
<br>
to western C20th / early C21st remains, there would be a large enough
<br>
catalogue of differences that they could be considered as two separate
<br>
species!
<br>
<p>Dr.'s Richard &amp; Lee Meadows Jantz, husband &amp; wife team of forensic
<br>
anthropologists, began researching their topic, to differentiate C19th &amp;
<br>
C20th skeletons, in the 1980's  ... with the goal of assisting law
<br>
enforcement
<br>
investigations (murders &amp;c) easier. About 15 years ago a nation-wide
<br>
forensic
<br>
database was set up that combined information from the Jantz's with the
<br>
University of Tennessee's extensive collection of remains, together with
<br>
Dr Mildred Trotter's reams of data from her work processing 1,000's of
<br>
bodies after WW2.
<br>
<p>It was already known that size had grown several inches, but Jantz
<br>
quickly recognised that &quot;the skeletons of modern people are strikingly
<br>
different from those of the (19th) century.&quot;
<br>
<p>Big changes are apparent in
<br>
shapes and sizes of certain bones in legs and forearms that have changed
<br>
in proportion to the rest of the body. C19th and C20th skeletons can
<br>
be told apart, for example, because the C19th femur viewed in cross-
<br>
section is round while the C20th counter-part is &quot;teardrop shaped.&quot;
<br>
<p>There is a difference also in toughness of bones. Short, rounded
<br>
C19th skeletons are able to withstand greater stresses than the
<br>
modern, longer bone of a different shape. The inference is that
<br>
modern people don't have the skeletal toughness of their ancestors.
<br>
<p>Various theories can be offered ... such as combination of better
<br>
nutrition and medical care, coupled with less exercise, has
<br>
triggered &quot;fundamental biological changes in how (humans) grow.&quot;
<br>
<p>As well as the fact that people walk far less in America
<br>
than previously, it is also true that individuals who would have died
<br>
in infancy today live long enough to have children of their own.
<br>
<p>The work comparing skeletons across time carries on in other
<br>
countries and regions to see whether the same trend is duplicated
<br>
across the globe. Croatia and the Balkans have offered up a
<br>
tremendous amount of data that the Jantz's students are starting to
<br>
process.
<br>
<p>Since it is true that skeletal comparisons are the main source of
<br>
data for categorising and (placing in geography &amp; time) the
<br>
various sub-human, pre-human and cro-magnon variants, I feel
<br>
that this evidence above all else goes to show that the transition
<br>
from classic &quot;human&quot; to &quot;after-human&quot; has already happened, at
<br>
least amongst a large swath of the technologically developed world.
<br>
<p>There will probably be further changes over the next hundreds of years,
<br>
but significant enough data exist to indicate that WE are amongst the first
<br>
after-human generations of humanoids ... Transhumans happened
<br>
between Darwin and the baby-boomer generations, the future is here!

<p>Um, that's an incredibly tall order.
