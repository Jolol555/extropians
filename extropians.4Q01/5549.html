<em>&gt; &gt; As someone who works for them, I most emphatically disagree that WLG as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it stands today is any closer than we are to &quot;owning&quot; the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They have zero concept of AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that what brings a monopolistic corporation close to owning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological singularity involves the alliances the corporation has. So,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether it's WLG or Microsoft that ends up with the patents to IT which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompany the rights to human-competitive AI expert systems, GP, etc., depends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on which AI companies they own rather than on their ability to conceptualize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI. It's not necessary to have a concept of internal combustion engines in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to own a fleet of Rolls Royce automobiles. All it takes is money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;When you can buy intelligence, alliances are more important than ability.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --Kim Cosmos
</em><br>
<p>True, *but*...it does take a concept of internal combustion engines in
<br>
order to produce or develop automobiles.  If they buy said concept, so
<br>
be it, but they'll still have it once bought.  And it is not anywhere
<br>
near relevant to their profits to buy into nanotech at this time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The only defense they believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they need is the legal system itself, and they believe they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sufficiently defended by it against all comers, now and forever.  (No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; matter how good a lawyer is, when the law is clear and explicit on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain matter and the facts are known well enough, the outcome tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be predetermined.  Which is kind of the point of laws.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well and accurately said, and because the law works that way, nothing (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even a technological singularity) can evade the law. As Peter Voss has pointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out, there are several reasons why so few researchers are pursuing real AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (See the thread: Artificial General Intelligence Workshops) Add to his list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons that AI research could become illegal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then only outlaws will pursue real AI.
</em><br>
<p>And as has been proven time and again, when the law and reality face
<br>
off, reality tends to win.  &lt;shrugs&gt; Not arguing that, just arguing why
<br>
WLG isn't on a course to &quot;own&quot; the Singularity.  The closest they could
<br>
get would be developing lawyer bots; if general purpose AI were to be
<br>
developed from that, it would have to be through a leak of the source
<br>
code to some other party to develop.  Which could well happen, but the
<br>
result probably wouldn't be traceable back to WLG, at least for legal
<br>
ownership purposes.
