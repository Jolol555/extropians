<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>Movies by Krzysztof Kieslowski enter my life at different times for
<br>
different reasons, and they've come up again, so I'll spend a few
<br>
moments here to describe one of my all-time favorites: the movie
<br>
_Blue_ (and the corresponding music by Zbigniew Preisner). (1993)
<br>
<p>This movie begins with a tragedy, and, on the surface, it is about a
<br>
woman, Julie (played by Juliette Binoche), learning to accept and
<br>
grow out of the largest losses that one can possibly have. When she
<br>
loses her husband and daughter in a terrible car accident,  for all
<br>
of its tragedy and drama, this is a luxurious situation: she is
<br>
completely free. Financially, she is provided for, and she has no
<br>
responsibilities. But how far is she really free? What does
<br>
'liberty' mean? Can one truly live a different life? Can one erase
<br>
the past? How far are we free from feelings? Is love a 'prison'? Or
<br>
is it freedom? In Blue, the main character faces a prison that she
<br>
creates by both her emotions and memory, and works her way out of
<br>
that prison with the help of music. She learns that she actually
<br>
can't free herself entirely from everything that's been.
<br>
<p>Blue is also a movie about music. Musical notes often appear on the
<br>
screen, about the writing of music, about working on music. When
<br>
Julie tries to erase the past, the past comes back to her in the
<br>
music. The musician who scored this movie wrote the music for many
<br>
other Kieslowski's films, and in some sense, Kieslowski's films and
<br>
Preisner's music are inseparable. Kieslowski knew the 'atmosphere'
<br>
that he wanted to create, and Preisner, as the movie was being
<br>
filmed, created the music to bring out more of the atmosphere. One
<br>
composer cited in the movie: &quot;Van der Budenmajer&quot; is a fictitious
<br>
Dutch composer that is Zbigniew Preisner's joke, because the music
<br>
is really his. Preisner took all of his old works, cited a birth and
<br>
death for Van der Budenmajer, and catalogued them with catalogue
<br>
numbers used for recordings.
<br>
<p>All three of the  Kieslowski trilogy: _Red_, _White_, _Blue_ (blue:
<br>
liberty, white: equality, red: fraternity) are about people who have
<br>
some sort of intuition or sensibility, who have &quot;gut feelings. Maybe
<br>
that's why I like these films alot. Kieslowski was (he died in
<br>
1997) a master at portraying the 'human condition', in very subtle,
<br>
and yet very moving ways.
