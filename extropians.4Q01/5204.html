Made me think of Internet mailing lists. (Except that punishment is not
<br>
usually practiced there !)
<br>
<p>Social structuring in the computer medium is likely to prefigure
<br>
nanotech-powered lower-inertia future society.
<br>
<p>This part of what makes the Internet so interesting. It is reality
<br>
made of desires, so to speak.

<p><p>Chen Yixiong, Eric wrote (25.12.2001/12:35) :
<br>
<em>&gt; Previously &quot;One humanity, all in the same boat&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A short note: We should refrain from saying &quot;one humanity&quot; because that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would exclude alien species. I use unity in this case to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean all sentient beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would like to ask readers here to consider a world separated more on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideological divisions rather than mere race, geographical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; location and skin color (or other equally superfluous different). In this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, different communities abound where each community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offers a unique ideology where one can subscribe to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One can choose to join any of these communities freely, and can start a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one if neccessary. This provides free competition (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the uniquely productive rather than redundant sense). The communities will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow a non-interventionist policy what some basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important rules:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Communities cannot detain people who wish to leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) They can restrict the people they take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Those who choose to stay or enter without permission will subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves to the internal rules of the community (such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punishment)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Communities cannot interfere in the affairs of the other communities who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signed this treaty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given this, no dictator can rule his or her own people without having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern about them because these people can always choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go to another community. Meanwhile, it does not deprive others of the choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to join, say, this dictatorship because of certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (perceived) advantages that we might not consider rational (such as for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious reasons).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such a world would provide vastly more choice for all people than say, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominated by socialist sentient AI (I mean this in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive way!) or a world dominated by an anacho-capitalist society. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should not assume that people will have the same goals as us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such as the pursuit of self-interest) or even that they have no goals at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, but to provide them with choices such that they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose their own path.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This could stop a lot of conflicts from happening because if people can live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way they disire, then presumely they would not need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fight for their &quot;cause&quot; whether we consider these rational or not. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exception, of course, lies with those whose ideologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require them to enslave or at least &quot;take over the world&quot;. This could cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some problems until a system exists to keep them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; check (or wait until most people venture space leaving these people with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sparsely populated planet Earth).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suggest considering this approach of &quot;many ideologies, many societies&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over alternative approaches that champion any one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed social systems. No shoe can fit everyone and we should learn that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the easy, rather than the hard way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We should also have a wider prespective rather than the egocentric &quot;my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people&quot;, &quot;my country&quot;, &quot;my planet&quot;  and even &quot;my species&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking. This kind of attachment causes a lot of unneccessary problems when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they conflict with others thinking along similiar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the first lesson any advanced sentient being can teach us, on first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contact, would consist of knowledge on how to live with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves. Technology will not serve us well if we only bothered to use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to build bombs to blast each other.
</em><br>
