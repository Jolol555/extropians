<p>So, it's no wonder that the other side doesn't feel very friendly towards 
<br>
you, right? And why are they our friends and allies? Are the Saudis also 
<br>
our friends and allies? What about Iran, the former evil, now part of the 
<br>
anti-terror alliance? What about Irak, former friend against Iran, now an 
<br>
enemy - while the government staid the same? Please tell me how to find out 
<br>
who is friend and who is enemy - and why this changes from time to time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may spend your money wherever you like, we will do the same.

<em>&gt; We are not the international welfare society.
</em><br>
<p>See, that's exactly the point. If this is so, then we should stop lying 
<br>
about our interests and frankly state that we don't care about human 
<br>
rights, democracy or other peoples fate, that this is only a fairy tale to 
<br>
betray our conscience. We could frankly say that we only care about our 
<br>
own luxury and will use every possible force to aquire it. What a wonderful 
<br>
clear situation: We no better than them, both unscrupulous. A simple 
<br>
barbaric scenario - light years away from extropianism, btw.
<br>
<p>I am second tired of simple explanations. &quot;They did this, therefore we shot 
<br>
them dead&quot;. There's always a reason behind every alliance and every enemy. 
<br>
Judging without understanding the motivation is medieval thinking.
