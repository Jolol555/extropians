<p>Sorry Rafal, I have to disagree here.  A few years ago the U.S.
<br>
added the 2nd part of your policy [wealth based tickets].
<br>
I think you have to demonstrate a net worth of around $1M.
<br>
The problem is that leaves the door wide open for people
<br>
who have accumulated that wealth through illegal means,
<br>
Russian mafia members or Columbian druglords for example.
<br>
<p>In contrast, since members of my family did arrive in this
<br>
country where one sister worked as a servent to bring over
<br>
other sisters and brothers from Ireland I'm not so sure
<br>
that revoking that criteria is a good idea (unless one can
<br>
make the case that there is just cause for changing a policy
<br>
that has historically worked fairly successfully).
<br>
<p>Mike has the right idea, &quot;How do you determine who is going
<br>
to be a positive contributing member of the crew and who is
<br>
going to be a detriment?&quot;.  Randy is trying to apply the
<br>
filter of education, Rafal is trying to apply the filter
<br>
of wealth (or more properly the demonstrated ability to
<br>
function productively in a capitalist economy).
<br>
<p>I'd suggest the best filter may require some aspects of
<br>
those elements but *also*, quite seriously, needs to apply
<br>
the filter of &quot;who can you *trust*&quot;.  I don't really have
<br>
any good ideas as to how you would do that unfortunately.
<br>
<p>We do have concrete evidence that immigrants from Arab
<br>
countries have a negative trust quotient while immigrants
<br>
from Canada or Mexico would seem to have a positive trust
<br>
quotient.  While I hate to say it due to its political
<br>
uncorrectness should we not use that evidence to protect
<br>
ourselves?
<br>
<p>Robert
