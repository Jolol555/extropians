<em>&gt; War is not an American courtroom I don't need proof beyond a reasonable doubt,

<p>One small problem.  We were not at war with this country
<br>
although we certainly acted as if we were.  Before violating the
<br>
sovereign borders of a country you certainly do need some
<br>
procedure if you are not going to be an international outlaw. 
<br>
And the court should be international, not American.

<p><em>&gt; more probable than not is good enough for me. Considering the murderous

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It was not probably in the least.  Try this url on for size:

<br>
<p><p>The government of Sudan has been screwy for sometime but
<br>
struggling to become more normalized.  Bombing out of existence
<br>
part of its industrial infrastructure is not helpful in
<br>
normalizing a country. 
<br>
<p>There was no nerve gas.  Even the paltry evidence elueded to was
<br>
never produced and no such thing found on inspection after the
<br>
bombing.  Your position above seems stubbornly blind to evidence
<br>
and reason.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; We launched missles against the territory and facilities of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; countries we were not at war with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody formally declares war anymore, it's as out of style as hoop skirts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but if Afghanistan wants to go against the tide and declare war on the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's fine by me. Oh wait, I'm wrong,  they've already done that with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jihad. Are you suggesting we just roll over and play dead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me but this is bullshit.  You don't just bomb hell out of
<br>
your neighbors whenever you feel like it without the neighbor
<br>
considering it an act of international criminality and/or
<br>
war.    
<br>
<p>I made no suggestions.  I simply pointed out that your opinion
<br>
is ill-informed saber rattling.  Please reconsider it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;We ultimately  did it because we could get away with it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A keen grasp of the obvious. The good thing is we can and well get away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with even more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think I want to speak to anyone who takes that opinion
<br>
in such matters of human life and death and international
<br>
relations.  If that is your attitude then everyone not in your
<br>
US club is quite justified in despising you as an immoral curr. 
<br>
To the extent the US acts inline with your sentiment they would
<br>
be quite justified in hatred toward it and in taking any means
<br>
they can to strike back.  Is that honestly what you want?  A war
<br>
of all against all until the strongest and perhaps most vile is
<br>
the only one left standing?
