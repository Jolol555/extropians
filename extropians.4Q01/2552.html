<p>
Can computers be creative?
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1647000/1647086.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1647000/1647086.stm</a>
<br>
&nbsp;The paintings are pleasing to the eye
<br>
<p>Creativity is one of those things which makes humans so special.
<br>
But could there ever be a day when computers are composers, theoretical
<br>
physicists, or artists?
<br>
<p>There are already a number of projects in artificial intelligence that try to
<br>
recreate creativity in computers. Harold Cohen has spent his whole career
<br>
designing a program called Aaron which creates original works of art.
<br>
&quot;We've barely scratched the surface of machine intelligence,&quot; says Mr Cohen.
<br>
<p>Pleasing artworks
<br>
He has given the program a knowledge base full of information about how people
<br>
look and how their bodies move. The program also understands composition,
<br>
brushwork and how to paint.
<br>
<p>Aaron plays with these thousands of interrelated variables to create works of
<br>
art.
<br>
Some say this amounts to creativity. Aaron's paintings look like art. They're
<br>
pleasing to the eye, drawing emotional response. Some pictures have even been
<br>
displayed in art galleries.
<br>
<p>&quot;Aaron is creative with a small &quot;c&quot; but not creative with a big &quot;c&quot;. You can
<br>
do creative basket-weaving or creative candle-making,&quot; says Mr Cohen.
<br>
<p>&quot;The problem is we don't know if there is a continuum between creative with a
<br>
small &quot;c&quot; and creative with a big &quot;c&quot;
<br>
&quot;If there is a continuum, then I think Aaron is a good deal more creative than
<br>
creative basket-weaving,&quot; he argues.
<br>
<p>&quot;If, as I suspect, they are two different things, then Aaron is not creative
<br>
and I don't yet know of any program that can be.&quot;
<br>
<p>Who is the artist?
<br>
Mr Cohen has given Aaron the rules, albeit very sophisticated rules with some
<br>
randomised parameters.
<br>
<p>Is Aaron any more creative than other random generation programmes?
<br>
&quot;I wrote the program; the program does the pictures,&quot; says Mr Cohen.
<br>
&quot;Am I the artist or is Aaron the artist? I don't know how to answer that.&quot;
<br>
Perhaps it's fairer to say that Harold Cohen is the artist. But the art here
<br>
is the program, not the end product.
<br>
<p>Model of an artist
<br>
Harold has created a model of the artist at work providing an insight into the
<br>
workings of an artist by formalising the creative process.
<br>
<p>Working in a similar field, Viennese researchers are teaching a computer to
<br>
play like a human pianist, finding patterns in the performance of real
<br>
pianists.
<br>
In other words, they are reducing a creative event to a sequence of rules.
<br>
It is getting harder all the time to tell where man stops and machine starts.
<br>
<p>So the question is whether we assume that there will forever be a core of
<br>
human attributes, like creativity, which will never be taken on board by
<br>
machine.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
