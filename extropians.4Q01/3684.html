This was posted on The Drudge report earlier this morning, I am told. It's 
<br>
now been removed except for the headline. Could this be IT? We'll find out 
<br>
tomorrow. If it is, I don't think it's world-changing, but it's pretty nifty.

<p>New York -- Dean Kamen's long-awaited, secret invention, the Segway &quot;will 
<br>
be to the car what the car was to the horse and buggy,&quot; he tells TIME on 
<br>
the eve of his product's unveiling.
<br>
<p>Kamen imagines them everywhere: in parks and at Disneyland, on battlefields 
<br>
and factory floors, but especially on downtown sidewalks from Seattle to 
<br>
Shanghai. &quot;Cars are great for going long distances,&quot; Kamen says, &quot;but it 
<br>
makes no sense at all for people in cities to use a 4,000-lb. piece of 
<br>
metal to haul their 150-lb asses around town.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the future he envisions, cars will be banished from urban centers to 
<br>
make room for millions of &quot;empowered pedestrians&quot; - empowered, naturally, 
<br>
by Kamen's brainchild, reports John Heilemann in next week's issue.
<br>
<p>The invention is set to be unveiled Monday morning during ABC's GOOD 
<br>
MORNING AMERICA.

<p>The Segway is a self-balancing people mover - powered by batteries and 
<br>
controlled by tilt-sensors and five solid state gyroscopes - that looks 
<br>
like a rotary lawnmower. The magic is in the balancing act ð no matter how 
<br>
hard you try, it won't let you fall.
<br>
<p>For the past three months, Kamen allowed TIME behind the veil of secrecy as 
<br>
he and his team grappled with the questions that they will confront - about 
<br>
everything from safety and pricing to the challenges of launching a product 
<br>
with the country at war and the economy in recession.
<br>
<p>There is no denying that the Segway, previously code-named &quot;IT&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;Ginger,&quot; is an engineering marvel, reports Heilemann, who rode on the 
<br>
machine many times. Developed at a cost of more than $100 million, Kamenis 
<br>
vehicle is a complex bundle of hardware and software that mimics the human 
<br>
bodyis ability to maintain its balance. Not only does it have no brakes, 
<br>
but also no engine, no throttle, no gearshift, and no steering wheel. And 
<br>
it can carry the average rider for a full day, nonstop, on only five cents' 
<br>
worth of electricity.
<br>
<p>Kamen explains how the Segway works: &quot;When you walk, youire really in 
<br>
whatis called a controlled fall. You off-balance yourself, putting one foot 
<br>
in front of the other and falling onto them over and over again. In the 
<br>
same way, when you use a Segway, thereis a gyroscope that acts like your 
<br>
inner ear, a computer that acts like your brain, motors that act like your 
<br>
muscles, wheels that act like your feet. Suddenly, you feel like you have 
<br>
on a pair of magic sneakers, and instead of falling forward, you go sailing 
<br>
across the room.&quot;
<br>
<p>As Kamen and his team were working on the IBOT wheelchair ð a six-wheel 
<br>
machine that goes up and down curbs, cruises effortlessly through sand or 
<br>
gravel, and climbs stairs - it dawned on them that they were onto something 
<br>
bigger. &quot;We realized we could build a device using very similar technology 
<br>
that could impact how everybody gets around,&quot; he says. The IBOT was also 
<br>
the source of Gingeris mysterious codename. &quot;Watching the IBOT, we used to 
<br>
say, ÈLook at that light, graceful robot, dancing up the stairsiÐso we 
<br>
started referring to it as Fred Upstairs, after Fred Astaire,&quot; Kamen 
<br>
recalls. &quot;After we built Fred, it was only natural to name its smaller 
<br>
partner Ginger.&quot; With Ginger, as with the IBOT, Kamen explains, &quot;the big 
<br>
idea is to put a human being into a system where the machine acts an 
<br>
extension of your body.&quot;
<br>
<p>With the Segway, Kamen plans to change the world by changing how cities are 
<br>
organized. To Kamenis way of thinking, the problem is the automobile. 
<br>
&quot;Cities need cars like fish need bicycles,&quot; he says. Segways, he believes, 
<br>
are ideal for downtown transportation. Unlike cars, they are cheap, clean, 
<br>
efficient, maneuverable. Unlike bicycles, they are designed specifically to 
<br>
be pedestrian friendly. &quot;A bike is too slow and light to mix with trucks in 
<br>
the street but too large and fast to mix with pedestrians on the sidewalk,&quot; 
<br>
he argues. &quot;Our machine is compatible with the sidewalk. If a Segway hits 
<br>
you, itis like being hit by another pedestrian.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ordinary consumers wonit be able to buy Segways for at least a year, a 
<br>
consumer model is expected to go on sale for about $3,000, Heilemann 
<br>
reports. For now, the first customers will be deep-pocketed institutions 
<br>
such as the U.S. Postal Service and General Electric, the National Parks 
<br>
Service and Amazon.comÐ institutions capable of shelling out $8,000 apiece 
<br>
for industrial-strength models.
<br>
<p>TIME also takes a hard look at the question of whether this product will 
<br>
really make it in the consumer market. &quot;The consumer market is always 
<br>
harder,&quot; Intel chairman Andy Grove, who also rode the Segway, told 
<br>
Heilemann. &quot;But when you think about it, the corporate market is almost 
<br>
unlimited. If the Postal Service and FedEx deploy this for all their 
<br>
carriers, the company will be busy for the next five years just keeping up 
<br>
with that demand.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>&quot;IT flies, IT zooms, it's gonna change everything&quot;
