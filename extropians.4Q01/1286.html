</em><br>
<p>Correct

<p><em>&gt; 	(even though we have the ability to know HOW - through

</em><br>
<p>You can know all kinds of things about how computers or robots work, but
<br>
that is irrelevant to the &quot;black box&quot; approach of behaviouristics. What is
<br>
relevant is whether the behaviouristics of the human can be matched or
<br>
simulated by the behaviouristics of the machine. Thus I used the example
<br>
of 2 and 3 D mine mapping because I used to be a mine mapper at Discovery
<br>
Mine, NWT, and because I can extract every kind of test for 2 and 3 D
<br>
spatial ability from the mine maps. What goes on inside a human mine
<br>
mapper? Maybe we won't know all of it for 1,000 years. But right now we
<br>
know that a host of questions/problems in this domain can lead to a host
<br>
of answers/solutions when presented to a competent human. When I see those
<br>
outlines sketches from CAD programs on ed tv they look just like the mine
<br>
maps at Discovery. I then reasonably think the behaviouristics of the
<br>
computer or robot with CAD and lots of Q-A sets built in as well has a
<br>
pretty good chance of simulating what the human mapper does. I don't have
<br>
to know any more about computers than any layman to draw that conclusion.
<br>
If there are hardware or software obstacles to that I'd like to hear about
<br>
them. Thus you can go across the profile of human mental abilities,
<br>
category by category (choose your own if you don't like mine) and draw
<br>
your own conclusions. I would hope others interested in AI would do this
<br>
and let me know. At each point in the profile, do you expect that SI&gt;HI or
<br>
HI&gt;SI? Why? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) IF humans have intelligent thinking 'process', and then codify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	(i.e. 'programme') a machine with the PRODUCTS of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	intelligence, and the machine can recapitulate that behaviour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	in response to a given set of input conditions, than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	it matters not if machines have PROCESS, since for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	'pragmatic' approach, it is PRODUCT that matters; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	machines are superb at reproducing PRODUCT once the process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	has been worked out for them (by humans - i.e. 'programmers').
</em><br>
<p>That's about it. Process can be whatever it is for mice, men and machines. 
<br>
Behaviouristics gives you an algorithm for everything manifested in this
<br>
world. At the very least everything manifested in this world is recordable
<br>
on a nominal scale. Those &quot;behaviouristic algorithms&quot; spell out the S-R
<br>
connections for us and THAT is all we need to deal with, not the process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Based on Behaviouristic Principles (i.e. observable, measurable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	PRODUCTS of behaviour), you wish to demonstrate that human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	products of intelligence codified into machine behaviours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	(i.e. 'programming') can exhibit higher speeds of execution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	in the PRODUCTS of Intelligence than humans can implement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	themselves. Therefore, it could be said from the standpoint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	of Behaviourism that within a given range of observable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	behaviour, and certain narrow measurable attributes, SI &gt; HI.
</em><br>
<p>As far as I can tell SI&gt;HI overall, yielding higher &quot;g&quot;, general
<br>
intelligence, for machines. That's quite broad IMO, not narrow. If you
<br>
disagree with me please select your set of HI categories, and then tell me
<br>
how you think machine products will compare in each case. Can the
<br>
correctly programmed machine give us the Q-A, Problem-Solution sets better
<br>
(faster and more accurately) than the human?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) These products of human intelligence that are exhibited in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	the programmed behaviour of machines COULD be mistaken for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	human behaviour (since the effort of the humans creating them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	is actually to mimick the human behaviours),
</em><br>
<p>Yes, depending on how they are presented to the user (eg anthropomorphic
<br>
machine or not).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;and thus to the
<br>
<em>&gt; 	unwitting public - stir up their sympathies, and cause people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	to attribute anthropomorphic qualities to the robots. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	because of this, people will be clamouring for machine rights,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	since they won't be able to distinguish the robot behaviour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	from the human behaviour, because in 'all the observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	categories of behaviour, it would act and respond in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	the same manner as a human (i.e. 'Robo-President').
</em><br>
<p>Sure. Eventually this is likely. I not alone in saying so. &quot;If it looks
<br>
like a duck....&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) the measurable attributes in their totality somehow WILL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	constitute a greater essence, SINCE 'Robo-President' WILL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	outperform humans in ALL aspects (enough to govern).
</em><br>
<p>Essence is not very behaviouristic. It is the SI behaviour which I expect
<br>
is greater than HI behaviour in totality, ie higher &quot;g&quot;. And yes, I think
<br>
the knowledge exists now which could lead to an R4P if 10 years and a few
<br>
billion go with it. But hey, maybe private and secret projects already
<br>
have one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6) Since people will naturally ONLY follow the Behaviouristic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	standpoint,
</em><br>
<p>They will see what they see.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;and since SI &gt; HI in observed measurable behaviours.
<br>
<em>&gt; 	The 'natural sympathy evoked' in people for machines that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	respond with the same 'output' in response to a certain set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	of 'inputs' (i.e. 'just like a human') -&gt; from this, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	follows that Machines should be granted Human Rights.
</em><br>
<p>I don't say they should. But I expect others will say that. &quot;If it looks
<br>
like a duck....&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 7) WHEN they ever get Quantum Computers to work, then maybe we'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	*really* have a 'conscious sentient' machine.
</em><br>
<p>IF they get quantum computers to work well, what I've read about quantum
<br>
effects causes me to think this will push humankind further in the
<br>
direction of PERCEIVING machines as conscious or sentient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if these do not correctly encapsulate your views in an acurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion, please give us the nutshell yourself. :-)
</em><br>
<p>They are close enough to be very helpful for discussion. Thank you for
<br>
taking the time to spell them out.
