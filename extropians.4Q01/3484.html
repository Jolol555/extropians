From: &quot;Pat Fallon&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:pfallon@ptd.net?Subject=Re:%20terrorism,%20what%20is%20and%20what%20should%20never%20be&In-Reply-To=&lt;002e01c177d3$5153b650$271d79a5@braniac&gt;">pfallon@ptd.net</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; I think it is very important to understand why we were attacked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Understanding why someone attacked you may help you avoid a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation in the future, for one thing.
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[snip] 
<br>
<em>&gt; IMHO, terrorism cannot be understood or effectively dealt with in isolation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from American foreign policy. Terrorism is a tactic, and it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually confusing to declare war on a tactic. You can kill individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists, but if the cause of their hatred is our interventionist foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy, more will just take their place.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I fear that no amount of federalization of airport security, whiz-bang
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, cruise missiles, mile-wide atomic helicopters, offices of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homeland security or electronic surveillance will stop Americans from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacked if our government continues to generate such hatred abroad.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the political leadership of the U.S. does not want to change its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interventionist foreign policy, instead, it will insist that Americans give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up their freedoms in exchange for promised security.
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt; How convenient for our leaders that most talking heads on TV use their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictionary. Hey, maybe it's just me, but I can't shake the notion that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gov/media is pushing the view that when terrorists attack, they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorizing. When we attack, we're retaliating. When they respond to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retaliation with further attacks, they're terrorizing again. When we respond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with further attacks, we're retaliating again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like &quot;collateral damage.&quot; I heard it first used by the Pentagon during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gulf War to describe the deaths of innocent Iraqis during the massive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombing campaign in 1991 and it seemed like an attempt to obscure and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalize these deaths through Orwellian jargon. &quot;Collateral damage&quot; also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was invoked to describe the effects of attacks on civilian passenger trains,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refugee convoys and the headquarters of Radio Television Serbia during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war in Kosovo.
</em><br>
<p>Good points.  I've been fidgeting about wanting to send a couple of links from The Progressive (for fear of being subjected to The Wrath of the Extropians:  &quot;Pummel! Pummel! Pummel!&quot;).  Awww, what the hell ...
<br>
<p>Here is Bin Laden in an eerily prescient interview of things to come, from a November 1998 issue: 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.progressive.org/webex/wxbin102401.html">http://www.progressive.org/webex/wxbin102401.html</a>  
<br>
<p>And here is a recent article from Howard Zinn:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.progressive.org/0901/zinn1101.html">http://www.progressive.org/0901/zinn1101.html</a>
<br>
<p>I don't agree with every point Zinn makes, but it was refreshing to read a different perspective than the mainly undistinguishable pablum we are being fed in the dailies and on CNN (&quot;Clone Network News&quot;).
