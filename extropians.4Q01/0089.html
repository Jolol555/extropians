Yes, you are probably safe indoors from a straight-up shot.
<br>
<p>Outdoors, my Fermi numbers say you could get your skull cracked even in this
<br>
(best case) scenario. 
<br>
<p>[Aside: Wood is, as it happens, a crappy model for human tissue. If you don't believe me, 
<br>
ask any regular member of the International Wound Ballistics Association.]
<br>
<p>A grain is 1/7000 of a pound, IIRC. 150 of those is .01 kg, near enough.
<br>
Round 300 fps up to 100 m/s. (1/2)mv^2 gives us 48 kg*m*s^-2, distributed
<br>
on the boattail in this case (the round is probably still gyrostabilized).
<br>
Bump that down a bit if you want. Now consider:
<br>
<p>1) Will the boattail land perfectly flat on your skull? How often? I would guess there
<br>
are at least two orders of magnitude possible variation in the contact area. Owie.
<br>
<p>2) Most rounds will not be going straight up. This makes a lot of difference.
<br>
Commercial and freeware exist for figuring external ballistics. Some is very good,
<br>
the best one I know having been done by perfectionist retired SLACers.
<br>
<p>3) Then there's secondary effects: broken glass hurting people, causing car
<br>
wrecks, etc.
