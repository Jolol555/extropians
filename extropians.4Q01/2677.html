I think people are giving the Taliban far too much credit, they are not
<br>
brilliant supermen and their massive retreat is not a subtle and diabolical
<br>
plot. Sometimes things are really what they appear to be, these are just a bunch
<br>
of not very bright religious fanatics who folded like a paper napkin when faced
<br>
with modern air power. This is not media hype this really is a big deal, they've lost
<br>
all their heavy artillery, most of their tanks, and 80% of their real estate. I know I'm right
<br>
because their soldiers are defecting right and left. The may try to go the guerrilla path
<br>
as there is nothing else they can do now, but I doubt it will work. Every successful guerrilla
<br>
movement has needed to be supplied by a friendly foreign nation or a friendly native
<br>
population, the Taliban have neither.  They're toast, and it was accomplished
<br>
without a single American combat death.
