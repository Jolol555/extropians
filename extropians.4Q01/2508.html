Michael said:
<br>
<em>&gt; Let me reiterate. Obi-L wants me dead until all infidels are out of Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabia. Well, that's what he wanted a few weeks ago. Now he's talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Israel, I hear.  
</em><br>
<p>I *really* think people need to reconsider this.  *If* the
<br>
conspiracy theorists are wrong (I've got *no* idea how to
<br>
validate some of the pointers posted by Daniel and Alex) --
<br>
and the &quot;party line&quot; motivations for bin Laden are correct --
<br>
then we are facing something much much worse than a megalomaniac.
<br>
Note my comment:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the lessons of history are plain -- ignore the desires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of megalomaniacs at your own peril.
</em><br>
<p>It occurs to me that we are not facing a simple &quot;megalomaniac&quot; --
<br>
we are instead facing the first reactions of resistance of the
<br>
pre-post-human meme set to the singularity!  If an essential part
<br>
of rational posthumanism is the development of secular states
<br>
(so children have at least some chance of choosing rationalism
<br>
over blind faith) then terrorist acts by &quot;fundamentalists&quot;
<br>
(Jew, Muslim, Christian, cult, etc.) are all attempts at
<br>
preserving &quot;faith&quot; over &quot;reason&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'll recopy a possible worst case analysis (which I haven't
<br>
seen anyone respond to yet):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here is the question for Amara, Samantha or others who think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. current approach is ill-conceived -- If the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately pulled out of Saudi Arabia, allowing Bin Laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to initiate a full revolt of the poor, unmarried young male
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population so as to depose the royal family and install himself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a leader of a hard line Islamic state -- *Do* you think he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would stop there?!?  Once he had the Saudi oil fields is there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any reason he should not use that card to keep Europe and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. out of the Mid-East while he proceeds to fund and supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies to overthrow the government of Egypt (3x the population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Saudi Arabia), continue on to retake Israel from the infidel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jews (returning it to an Arabic state) and launching a campaign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to wrest Kashmir from India?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, do you really think that Israel and India (both nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powers) are going to sit around and allow that to occur?
</em><br>
<p>The threat of the &quot;worst case&quot; to Michael's governments existing
<br>
&quot;to keep people feeling safe&quot; seems much higher by capitulating
<br>
or ignoring bin Laden than going after him.  I'll note that
<br>
the problem seems unlikely to go away even if bin Laden is
<br>
eliminated because the motivations behind scenarios to eliminate
<br>
secular states and reestablish states where the meme sets are
<br>
dictated by interpretations of a 1200+ or 2000 year old books
<br>
are *not* going to go away in this generation.
<br>
<p>One thing that came up in one of references posted was
<br>
the likelyhood that CIA funds went to bin Laden to
<br>
construct some of the &quot;caves&quot; [bunkers?] in Afghanistan.
<br>
If true, one would presume the CIA knows the location
<br>
of those caves.  It seems logical that the entrances
<br>
to such facilities would best be located in highly
<br>
populated regions (for easy access to critical
<br>
persons during bombing or shelling activities).
<br>
Where better to locate bunkers than underneath a
<br>
Red Cross storage facility?  I think we have met
<br>
the enemy and he is us.
