<br>
By HOWARD W. FRENCH
<br>
<p>YAMATO, Japan - While several other children whipped up a commotion in a
<br>
hospital playroom here, one lone boy lingered in the entrance, too shy or too
<br>
frightened to take off his shoes and enter the fray.
<br>
<p>That is until a hospital volunteer, a student from a nearby university,
<br>
beseeched one of several puppies playing on the wooden floor to raise its paw:
<br>
&quot;Paw, Aibo. Paw.&quot; The dog raised a foot, and with that the boy's shoes were
<br>
off and he quickly lost himself in play.
<br>
<p>Boys and dogs go back too far to reckon. But Aibo is no ordinary package of
<br>
flesh, fur and saliva. He is a robot, made instead of plastic, metal and
<br>
computer circuitry, and capable of deftly simulating emotions, of a wide range
<br>
of doglike behaviors - minus the growling and snapping - and of keeping a
<br>
roomful of children (and adults) absolutely rapt.
<br>
<p>&quot;Being hospitalized can be very stressful for children, and we are trying to
<br>
put them more at ease by using techniques like these,&quot; said Dr. Akimitsu
<br>
Yokoyama, a psychiatrist who runs the robot therapy program at Yamato
<br>
Municipal Hospital, one of several in Japan. &quot;Children who are repeatedly
<br>
hospitalized must constantly make new friends. But for them to know that the
<br>
same Aibo they had befriended during their last visit will be there is very
<br>
comforting.&quot;
<br>
<p>Few, if any, countries have adapted notions like automation and virtual
<br>
reality so widely or embraced them so fully as Japan, where animated films,
<br>
for example, are consistently the biggest hits.
<br>
<p>People here have long taken artificial companionship for granted. From the
<br>
virtual care and feeding of digital toys like the egg-shaped Tamagotchi to the
<br>
computerized maps in cars that speak driving instructions and announce
<br>
landmarks, few Japanese are ever completely alone.
<br>
<p>In fact, for those grown tired of the dating game, in one of the latest fads
<br>
spawned by the ever-present mobile phone, many men nowadays maintain
<br>
&quot;relationships&quot; with virtual girlfriends via cellular e-mail.
<br>
<p>With the development of the Aibo, Sony, the maker of the $1,600 robot, is
<br>
merely pursuing a theme it first developed in 1979 with the first Walkman:
<br>
portable, mood-enhancing companionship. Just two years after the first Aibo
<br>
models went on sale, Sony, along with several Japanese competitors, is
<br>
predicting a future in which man's best friends will be mostly man-made.
<br>
<p>&quot;When we started we had no idea how many of these we could sell,&quot; said Satoshi
<br>
Amagai, president of Sony Entertainment Robot Company. &quot;Most of all, we never
<br>
imagined how many people would have wanted this as a substitute pet. We test
<br>
marketed the first Aibo with only 5,000 units, imagining it as something that
<br>
would interest gadget and technology fans, but we ended up inventing the first
<br>
hi-touch category product line instead.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. Amagai said that hi-touch meant &quot;hi-tech things that provide a sense of
<br>
emotional attachment.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Aibo has taken off in Japan, where the overwhelming majority of the
<br>
120,000 models has been sold, but tellingly has not sold well overseas.
<br>
<p>Moreover, while most fancy new gadgets tend to be embraced first by the young,
<br>
the Aibo is most popular among lonely elderly people, a category that abounds
<br>
in Japan. Even for the gadgets' designers, these disparities suggest basic
<br>
differences in the willingness of Japanese versus Western consumers to embrace
<br>
technological companionship.
<br>
<p>For Sony, though, this just means trying harder. Mr. Amagai said that future
<br>
Aibos would understand far more than the 75 words it can grasp at present, be
<br>
able to recognize people's faces and respond in kind, and relate to other
<br>
mechanical pets through wireless communication.
<br>
<p>Sony's most prominent competitor in the race to develop robotic companions is
<br>
the automaker Honda. At a convention center in Yokohama the other day, Honda's
<br>
Asimo, the first production model of a new humanoid robot, held a large
<br>
audience in thrall, leading them through a nursery school rhymelike pantomime.
<br>
<p>After its performance, the robot, which looks like a diminutive astronaut in a
<br>
space suit, found its own way to the stage exit with the jerky gait of a tipsy
<br>
salaryman, and turned around to bow and wave goodbye.
<br>
<p>Honda eschews its rival's emotional approach, focusing on functionality. For
<br>
now, the Asimo, which roughly means two-legged mobility, is not sold, but
<br>
rather rented to companies to be used as a greeter at industrial shows and
<br>
other meetings. Company officials envision a day when household companions
<br>
will be sold that can fetch a beer or the newspaper, or even cook a meal.
<br>
<p>&quot;You don't need to physically move around for information anymore in the age
<br>
of the Internet,&quot; said Masato Hirose, the 45-year-old father of the Honda
<br>
robot. &quot;But if you want to move objects physically, machines like Asimo will
<br>
be necessary.&quot;
<br>
<p>But for now there is Aibo, whose part in Dr. Yokoyama's therapy sessions
<br>
represents the achievement of a robot-maker's dreams, and perhaps Japan's as
<br>
well. Is there any other country where a doctor would say, with the slightly
<br>
startling giggle of a tinkering scientist, &quot;I know that real animals are even
<br>
better than robots, but by introducing Aibo into the hospital environment, I
<br>
hope to discover why.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;You'll learn to like robots. They'll be nicer than human beings.&quot;

<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
