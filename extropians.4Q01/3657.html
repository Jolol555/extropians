</em><br>
<p>Yes, Eliezer I think, has perhaps an important point here.  My limited
<br>
thinking on the subject was based on the very narrow viewpoint that
<br>
intelligence correlates with success / lack of intelligence correlates
<br>
with lack of success.  { Don't dis me on this, I think this was documented
<br>
quite effectively in a recent article, if I remember properly in Scientific
<br>
American, on how people with IQ's lower than ~90 had higher probabilities
<br>
of criminal activities, lower success in personal relationships, etc. }
<br>
<p>The fact that intelligence may allow one to add an additional vector,
<br>
e.g. intelligence promotes rational thinking is perhaps very useful.
<br>
I'm unaware of &quot;hard&quot; data that says &quot;intelligent&quot; people are less
<br>
likely to believe in myths and fairy tales.  One of the most intelligent
<br>
people I've ever encountered, a hard core physicist who was much smarter
<br>
than myself, was also a committed Christian.  However, I'd tend to
<br>
lean in the direction that more intelligent people have a better
<br>
chance than most of removing irrational memetic paradigms.
<br>
<p>So, I will grant that the point may have some merit.  Perhaps offsetting
<br>
that might be the question of whether one would want to make presumably
<br>
intelligent individuals (Stalin?, Hussein?) with sociopathic tendencies
<br>
even smarter.  [A few bad apples can spoil the whole bunch...]
<br>
<p>As a side comment re: FDA approval -- it isn't clear to me once cells
<br>
have been &quot;approved&quot; for implantation whether the FDA would have any
<br>
say as to *where* or in whom they could be implanted.  There is a *lot* of
<br>
flexibility that indivividual physicians have in the practice of Medicine
<br>
and the current Dept. of Justice vs. Oregon's Euthanasia standoff will tell
<br>
us a lot about the degree to which the constitution will limit the
<br>
federal powers regarding states rights in that area.
<br>
<p>Then, Mike Linksvayer &lt;<a href="mailto:ml@gondwanaland.com?Subject=Re:%20MEDICINE:%20When%20it%20rains%20it%20pours&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10112011915170.23897-100000@server.aeiveos.com&gt;">ml@gondwanaland.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<p><em>&gt; So, if you or anyone would care to speculate a bit more, I'm

</em><br>
<p>I think you would have to ask Anders -- my guess is that anything that
<br>
boosts memory is going to involve the hippocampus.  As far as rational
<br>
thought goes, I'd guess the cortex as a whole.
<br>
<p>I would generally assume that human beings are functional with IQ's up into
<br>
the 170-180 range and so in theory you should at least be able to boost
<br>
people at least that far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But really, concern over intelligence-generated gap between rich
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and poor has got to be combatted.  In a relatively free market, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone gets rich through applying their intellect, they only get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich to the extent they provide superior goods that people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to pay for, increasing the wealth of the entire society in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the process.
</em><br>
<p>I'm forced, upon further reflection, to agree with Mike and Eliezer.
<br>
One would presume that state funded boosts of the least intelligent
<br>
would payoff in reduced state expenditures for such individuals.
<br>
So it makes sense that states would make support for such opperations
<br>
available to all who want them.  (With the caveat that smart hardcore
<br>
criminals are likely to be a bigger problem than less smart criminals.)
<br>
<p>Now, where it gets sticky is perhaps for the &quot;average&quot; individual --
<br>
one who doesn't cost the state anything but one who isn't winning
<br>
a Nobel prize every year either.  I suppose one could argue that
<br>
providing the equivalent of a &quot;student loan&quot; program for them
<br>
to be able to fund their enhancements would make sense.  However
<br>
I'm not sure what happens in a society where everyone has an
<br>
IQ of 170-180.  Do we just get a reflection of the current
<br>
society with a bell curve of intelligence, wealth, etc. that is
<br>
much higher.  Such a society would certainly advance much more
<br>
much more quickly into our future.  If that is the correct picture
<br>
then the early adopters may have a relatively easy time repaying their
<br>
loans but the late adopters may find themselves in a much more
<br>
competitive market.  Alternatively if it makes the society much
<br>
more productive then we might break through into the period where
<br>
survival itself is not dependent upon the exercise of ones capabilities
<br>
so there isn't really any downside per se.
