</em><br>
<p>I suppose there is some unstated linkage in some minds, but personally I
<br>
was on record that the age of downloading would be a good thing long
<br>
before it actually got here.  I see information in much the same way I
<br>
see technology: ultimately, more is better, so I want more of it to be
<br>
created and more people to have it.  Sure, some people will do evil things
<br>
with it, but in the long run they will be overtaken by those who do good
<br>
things.  The only reason we haven't been in the age of downloading for
<br>
100 years now is because our legal system erected barriers to the spread
<br>
of information and technology (ironically, on the pretext of encouraging
<br>
creation of more).  The question to me is not &quot;is the age of downloading
<br>
a good thing&quot;, but &quot;was this present era of IP a good thing, and should
<br>
we even try to maintain it, or reproduce it technically?&quot;  of course
<br>
examining this is very tricky since we can't measure what the last two
<br>
centuries would have been like without it; we can only speculate and
<br>
amke educated guesses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that the age of downloading will probably reduce the total amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of money that goes to artists,...
</em><br>
<p>Value is produced by _desire_; will people want music, books, or art less
<br>
than they do now?  No, the amount of money available should stay about
<br>
the same, because the size of the market is determined by demand,
<br>
not supply.  Who gets how much of that money is another issue.  I tend
<br>
to think artists _can_ get a higher percentage of it than they do now,
<br>
but whether or not the culture will adapt to make it easy for them to do
<br>
that is another question.  For example, there is the silly counter-
<br>
productive &quot;art for art's sake&quot; meme that causes artists to avoid &quot;selling
<br>
out&quot; (i.e. producing something useful to others).  That will certainly
<br>
have to change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are various things that can be done about the probable decrease in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artist revenues.  Eliminating middlemen will increase the amount that goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to artists.  For those who are willing to put effort into this, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most leveraged approach is to create tipping infrastructures, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tips going directly to the artists, despite the screams this will cause by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the RIAA and MPAA.  But in the long run, even that is doomed.  Content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that doesn't request tips will drive out content that requests tips.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't download shareware anymore because there's almost always an entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free alternative at CNET downloads.  I don't know that this decreases the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality of software, but my guess is that it does - although open-source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may make up for that, and too little time has passed to tell in any case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it was just a guess to begin with.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that there will be some short-term upheaval, and dealing with that
<br>
in some way could be useful.  Firing middle-men is a good start--but make
<br>
sure you fire the right ones!  Good marketers produce value too (by
<br>
increasing demand).  IP lawyers are the real leeches; they're first on
<br>
the block, because they produce no value at all.  &quot;Distributors&quot; will be
<br>
the next to go, because distribution of bits is a solved problem, and
<br>
distribution of physical media won't be needed anymore. But that still
<br>
leaves a lot of people to support (concert promoters, technicians,
<br>
advertisers, etc.)  I suspect a lot of them will have to adjust to new
<br>
methods of grabbing consumer dollars, and some won't make it.  But they'll
<br>
find work selling physical things, adn today's visionaries will fill in
<br>
the gaps.
