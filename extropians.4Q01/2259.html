Daniel forwards Tibor Machan:
<br>
<em>&gt; Yet it is rarely suggested that all the government funding of research and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scholarship may well have a corrupting affect on these endeavors. Recently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several philosophers--among them most notably Peter Singer--refused to even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attend conferences on environmental issues sponsored by Shell Oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corporation on the expressed ground that doing so would contribute to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corruption of the disciplines being considered at the conference. Yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of scholars every year take part in government-funded NEH and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarly government-sponsored seminars, and thousands more take money from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government to help them write their books and do their research. I have yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hear the same complaint from the folks so concerned about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industry-sponsored work about government-funded work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet surely the state, given its far greater power and lack of competition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a more serious threat to scholarly and scientific objectivity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonpartisanship than are private firms that must always be careful that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work of other, competing firms will attract great respect and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trustworthiness and, thus, profits.
</em><br>
<p>I think the difference is that private industrial research generally
<br>
makes no claim of objectivity.  As an institution, business has as its
<br>
avowed purpose profit-making.  Research is openly stated to be intended
<br>
to increase profits.  While it is true that overly biased research can
<br>
be counter-productive to this goal, still there is a presumption in
<br>
general that research is there to benefit the company that funds it.
<br>
<p>No such claims or goals exist with government-sponsored research.
<br>
Government research is explicitly designed with the purpose of objective
<br>
advancement of the truth.  There is no open understanding or intention
<br>
that government research exist to further the goals of the government,
<br>
as there is with business.
<br>
<p>Although I do think that in practice there is a bias, at least in some
<br>
politically-oriented research, I think that Machan somewhat misstates
<br>
the nature of the bias in government funding by comparing it to business.
<br>
This analogy would suggest that political researchers would be influenced
<br>
to support current government policies.  Today they would be expected
<br>
to promote Republican economic policies and support the war effort.
<br>
<p>But in fact this is not the sort of bias we see.  Academics generally
<br>
are liberals, much more so than Republicans, and in most cases even
<br>
more so than mainstream Democratic governments.  The academy is the
<br>
most left-leaning of major American institutions, retaining considerable
<br>
numbers of socialists and quasi-communists even as these ideologies have
<br>
failed in the real world.  Academics generally do not work to support
<br>
government policies.  The people who fund research have no expectation
<br>
that the work will advance the causes of whatever government is still
<br>
in power.  The situation is quite different from much industrial research.
<br>
<p>What we do see, as Machan's examples show, is a more familiar form
<br>
of bias: self-interest.  Academics generally support policies which
<br>
will benefit the academy.  They are leftist supporters of even bigger
<br>
governments, a policy which would funnel even more funds into academic
<br>
research.  They object to Machan's libertarianism, not because it is in
<br>
opposition to the policies of the funders, for their own research is as
<br>
well; but because, if put into effect, it would cut off their own funding.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, self-interest is the primal human emotion and there is
<br>
no funding mechanism which will eliminate this effect.  If we did have
<br>
private funding of research, eventually researchers would take on an
<br>
ideological bias in favor of that method which would be just as bad as
<br>
the present system.  If we went to some of the more radical proposals
<br>
such as Robin's Idea Futures, bias would be present as well.
<br>
<p>Undoubtedly Machan has been hurt by the bias present in those who dole out
<br>
funds for political research, which is unfortunate.  But I think he needs
<br>
to narrow his criticism and focus on the actual cause of the problem.
<br>
That will expose how fundamental the trouble is and how hard it is going
<br>
to be to fix.
<br>
