<p>I'm not sure that this experiment can be considered scientific
<br>
at all though.  That is,
<br>
<p>&quot;One group received pictures of the women and prayed for an
<br>
increase in their pregnancy rate. Another group prayed to
<br>
improve the effectiveness of the first group. A third group
<br>
prayed for the two other groups.&quot;
<br>
<p>The real fun would begin if you had yet another group pray for
<br>
the experiment to turn out positive.  Indeed, perhaps they did
<br>
have such a group and it's simply not documented.  It's
<br>
possible that the scientists spouses and/or friends prayed for
<br>
the experiment to turn out positive (or, more likely, just for
<br>
the scientists to be successful) without the scientists
<br>
knowing.  The problem, for me, is that the conjecture - that
<br>
prayer is effective or that people can influence the outcome
<br>
of events from a distance - undermines the experiment if true.
