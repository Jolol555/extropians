</em><br>
<em>&gt; Non-Zero-sum Island.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it's not Zero Sum Island naturally. The extra produce is the
<br>
positive sum result of the guys using shovels rather than bare hands or
<br>
clamshells to till their land. It only became  Zero Sum Island because
<br>
the only guy with a gun imposed Value Added Taxes on everybody' else's
<br>
productive output such that each other person only keeps that amount of
<br>
food they would have raised if they were still tilling with bare hands
<br>
and clamshells.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's another island where a lone genius with a gun and a machine he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built himself out of old clams that makes shovels, which he keeps locked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up. Same story, by the end.
</em><br>
<p>Not quite. At first, there was just one shovel available in the first
<br>
growing season, that had to be shared among the ten farming guys. Thus
<br>
the fellow who produced the one shovel rented it out to each for 10% of
<br>
the crop of each farmer. Since the shovel allowed each farmer to double
<br>
their yeild, everybody is living in Positive Sum Paradise. The next
<br>
year, the guy produces two shovels, because he didn't have to focus on
<br>
producing his own food, and now there are twenty more people who can
<br>
farm, and the shovel maker is now raking in the proceeds of 3 full
<br>
farms, which allows him to hire two apprentices, so the next season they
<br>
are able to produce 6 shovels OR one tilling machine that can do the
<br>
work of ten shovels.....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now Mike will object that the guy with the shovels would never be so stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to act this way. He's always rented those shovels out and earned a fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slice of the work of the digging guys. Not only that, but on the day the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digging guys come and take away his shovels they just use them to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sand castles and everyone starves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lots of islands, lots of stories.
</em><br>
<p>On the island where they just took the shovels and killed the shovel
<br>
maker because he was obviously bourgoisie, within ten years the shovels
<br>
wore out and everybody was reduced to farming with their bare hands and
<br>
being exhorted for not be patriotic little communists, and whoever
<br>
produced the least each year was taken out and shot for
<br>
counterrevolutionary activities and gold bricking. In ten years, only
<br>
two people are left alive on the island, and the surplus people from
<br>
Positive Sum Paradise move in to colonize the island, but are forever
<br>
blamed by the descendants of the two original survivors for ruining
<br>
their hunter-gatherer existence....
