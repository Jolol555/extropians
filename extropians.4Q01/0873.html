<em>&gt; Subject: Re: Posthuman Politics

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First of all, let's get one thing completely straight.  The term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;transhuman&quot; is sometimes used as if it meant &quot;transhumanist&quot;, which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object to, but is nonetheless an existing usage.  The term &quot;posthuman&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely reserved for genuine posthuman entities.  You can be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthumanist, but not a posthuman.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Who are you to tell ME what I can or cannot be! I am not a &quot;human&quot; but
<br>
am &quot;after&quot; (post-) that species, although I acknowledge my human ancestry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With that out of the way, your strategies are still messed up.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require far too many people to function.  A research project may require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious funding and serious people, but at least it doesn't require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of an entire country's population.  Strategies that require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of a population to participate have been known to succeed.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American Revolution succeeded.  Martin Luther King succeeded.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything on that massive a scale takes billions of dollars, a core group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of activists willing to devote their entire lives to the problem, and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it still takes a generation to set up the initial conditions if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't been set up already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
At least I offer a clear strategy, rather than just a talk-shop. Your
<br>
attempt at semantics, as well as being plain wrong in linguistic
<br>
terms, is also counter-productive in getting anything done about
<br>
changing the state of affairs in the world. Mine is PROACTIVE evolution.
<br>
Anti-Darwinism in Richard Dawkin's sense of the word. By claiming
<br>
to be and acting as post-human, I reinforce my and other's opinions
<br>
that yes, I actually AM post-human.
<br>
<p>Of course I might have claimed to be trans-human or extropian, but
<br>
these claims are subsets of the claim to follow the &quot;human&quot; period of
<br>
the species. Even if you are in intermediary stage you are still &quot;after&quot;
<br>
the human stage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't have that kind of time, 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I am saying we DON'T have luxury of a lengthy timescale and
<br>
must be prepared to evolve more quickly, and to be less afraid
<br>
to promote our agenda more positively and to more people MORE
<br>
quickly .... it is the notion that a further 500 years of transition is
<br>
needed that is the tardy approach. The transhuman phase is already
<br>
over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and furthermore you're treating this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole issue like a contest for the position of tribal chief.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I have no wish to personalise things in such a way, and in fact
<br>
am fairly anti-leader, anti-messianic and loosely anarchistic in
<br>
how I see posthuman organisation &amp; politics emerging. Now if
<br>
you mean that I am trying to &quot;give a lead&quot;   .... OK, I am. But
<br>
that is different from claiming that I am trying to be the big 
<br>
cheese and tell everyone else what to do ..... far from it! 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; objective here is not to take over the existing tribe or go split off your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own.  This is about technology. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Yes, but not about technology by itself in glorious, academic 
<br>
isolation. I have strong social ideas that are worth an airing, such
<br>
as the posthuman &quot;quorum&quot; structures, instead of the existing very
<br>
narrow range of choice to pair-bonding (homo or hetero) embedded
<br>
in human-era culture. (<a href="http://www.multi.co.uk/Quorums.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/Quorums.htm</a>).
<br>
<p>It is also about philosophy, and the philosophical struggle we
<br>
have against regressive forces of old-age theology &amp; supernaturalism.
<br>
<a href="http://www.multi.co.uk/supernat.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/supernat.htm</a>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;If you're still interested in seceeding,
<br>
<em>&gt; I suggest you go read &quot;How To Start Your Own Country&quot; so that you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become discouraged enough to give up.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A very negative sentiment that brings shame to you. I want to
<br>
encourage and empower people rather than spread discouragement.
<br>
Unless of course you have some interest in retaining the status quo?
<br>
I believe in continual evolution on the other hand .....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I'm being too harsh here.  I guess a lot of these ideas look a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less silly if you're planning for a 50-year or, ha ha, 100-year outlook. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But try pretending, as a mental exercise, that everything you do with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life has to be completely finished by 2008 to do any good, and see what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that does to your perspective.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My most important work (Median Vision Theory) was finished a
<br>
long time ago (1980) although I still work on expansion and 
<br>
promotion of the idea. <a href="http://www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/primal.htm</a> The genie
<br>
can't be put back into the bottle even if I cease tomorrow.
