writes:It would be really wise, if you want to live a long time, to take some 
<br>
care and respect and learn something of that culture (or any culture!) that 
<br>
the U.S. wishes to &quot;rebuild&quot;.
<br>
<p>I have to agree with Amara.  The book Lucifer Principle makes the point that 
<br>
charity is perceived as a put down.  It says &quot;Look, I am better than you.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand a fellow named Robert L. Humphrey was the best 
<br>
conflict resolver our State Department seems to have had during the 50s and 
<br>
60s.  When communities of overseas Americans would get into cross purposes 
<br>
with the local population the State Department would hire Humphrey to go 
<br>
defuse the situation.  His methods were startling with some people but 
<br>
worked.  I won't try to repeat here what it took him a book to say but 
<br>
basically he said:
<br>
1.  You have to be confident of your ability to protect yourself in a face 
<br>
off.  This is only for self confidence when talking to people and is not a 
<br>
recommendation to go around punching folks out.  He was an ex-professional 
<br>
boxer -- either a welterweight or middleweight.
<br>
2.  You have to get down in the mud where the &quot;other&quot; lives, look them in the 
<br>
eye and show them that you don't think yourself better than they.  This comes 
<br>
mostly from understanding that all 100% of us wish ourselves well and want 
<br>
the best for our spouse and children.  Even the lowest of us wishes as much 
<br>
for himself or herself as the most exalted of us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Humphrey, I think that might be Dr. Humphrey, had some startling 
<br>
conclusions lying behind his rather basic manner of behavior.  Given the 
<br>
world we are facing he offers an idea of how we can win friends.  One of the 
<br>
consequences would be an ability to defeat anyone that attacks us with a 
<br>
smaller, less expensive, military.  In other words OBL would find himself 
<br>
losing friends and supporters to the point that he became a much smaller 
<br>
problem.
