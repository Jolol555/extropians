<em>&gt; Has that hot Aussi sun hardboiled yours and Damien's brains? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ;)  Ok now put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the skis because here we go down the slippery slope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you prefer 2 more years as &quot;you&quot; or a 1000 years of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doppelgangerhood?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Hint: think of the wife and the kids). 
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but you've given the game away right here.
<br>
<p>What you've invoked in this reference to &quot;the wife and kids&quot; here is not 
<br>
the value of my own, personal existence to itself (ie: to me). Rather,
<br>
you are invoking the utility of an Emlyn to other people.
<br>
<p>And in predicting my actions, you would be absolutely correct. If I 
<br>
could choose between 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 more years of Emlyn and 0 years of Emlyn', 
<br>
or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 more years of Emlyn and 1000 years of Emlyn',
<br>
<p>I would choose the latter, most certainly. But not for the right 
<br>
reasons! Particularly, I'd be doing it for &quot;the wife and kids&quot;. To me,
<br>
it would not be life extension, it would actually be a huge personal
<br>
sacrifice. I'd have to do it in secret, too, because it'd only 
<br>
be fair on my family if they never knew.
<br>
<p>It's a similar question to &quot;Would you rather die tomorrow, or 
<br>
live another 1000 years at the cost of 10,000 people on the other side of
<br>
the world, who you never would have interacted with, dying tomorrow&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally, I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take the 1000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than the 50 but I can't say that I have no attachment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of molecules. I would probably take 999.5 years with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present set as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to 1000 as a doppelganger, which probably means I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not as pure a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionalist as I could be, but I am not sure how much more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to sacrifice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Why not go a step further?
<br>
<p>For each of us, chances are that the following statement is true:
<br>
There exists person X, who's utility to society* is greater than yours
<br>
(given that
<br>
we have some magical metric for measuring such).
<br>
<p>Which of the following would you (as a functionalist) do. Which would you do
<br>
as yourself? Why?
<br>
<p>1 - Live out your 3 score &amp; 10.
<br>
2 - Be replaced** tomorrow by your exact (enough) replica, who will live
<br>
1000 years. 
<br>
3 - Be replaced** tomorrow by an exact (enough) replica of person X, who
<br>
will live 1000 years.
<br>
<p>* Insert your personal favourite subset of all people; Nation? Village?
<br>
Family? The guy at the video shop?
<br>
** By replaced, I mean what non-functionalists would understand as &quot;die&quot;.
