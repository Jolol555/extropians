<p>Do you have a personal grudge against Courts or the Police? 
<br>
You certainly aren't managing to keep your rational balance
<br>
amongst all this anti &quot;Law&quot; tirade. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Your idea of personal agreements regards property transactions is
<br>
a complete non-starter. What about all the parties not aware of
<br>
the agreement? Also, how do you enforce the agreement without
<br>
a wider code of behaviour? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't believe in &quot;Natural Law&quot; in any divine sense, but a belief
<br>
that there are &quot;Laws&quot; is pretty undeniable ... every country
<br>
has them and they are written down. If you want to play chess,
<br>
how can you meaningfully engage with other players if you define
<br>
the Laws of Chess exactly how you choose? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Animal society have social norms, enforced by violence or
<br>
threat, but they don't have writing or objective language. Are you
<br>
in favour of monkey-troupe type societies when you basically
<br>
do whatever you can get away with, including killing the young
<br>
of rival males?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I would hope that posthuman 'codes/ laws' are a big modification
<br>
of those devised by primitive human societies, but I wouldn't want
<br>
to replace Law with Lawlessness, which seems to be your aim.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Oh yeh, and this e-group is subject to Yahoo! terms of service
<br>
(rules). Surely I am entitled, like them, to ask adherence to
<br>
my company's requests, for e-groups that choose to avail themselves
<br>
of belonging to this 'club.' If you break club rules/ laws the Yahoo!
<br>
could (directly &amp; legally) kick you out of the club? You accepted 
<br>
the rules as a pre-condition of joining ... so what is wrong with Laws
<br>
of this type?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Sure there is a problem with (human) POLITICIANS, but this is
<br>
a separate issue entirely from the Legislative process. They would
<br>
probably be grasping ego-maniacs even in our monkey-troupe
<br>
society ..... 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My advice .. read King Asoka. www.multisell.com/philosophy.htm
<br>
and learn about Bentham , JS Mills and others regarding
<br>
when it is OK to break an unjust Law. I want better Laws and a
<br>
better process, not the removal of Law with no viable replacement.
