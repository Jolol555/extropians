New Scientist has a nice article on the how the U.K.
<br>
is scrambling to correct its human cloning debacle
<br>
and in the process finding out how much of a swamp
<br>
they have waded into...
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991602">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991602</a>
<br>
<p>You can hear the screams about the proposed fixes...
<br>
<p>&quot;It won't stop human cloned embryos being placed in animals&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Bruno Quintavale of the Pro-Life Alliance
<br>
<p>Precisely...
<br>
<p>Note:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The alliance wanted the new law to ban creation of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloned human embryo, even for therapeutic cloning. &quot;If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you allow creation of cloned embryos, it makes it almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable someone will implant them,&quot; says Quintavalle. 
</em><br>
<p>Ah, well, so thats a good reason to prevent the research
<br>
that might save billions of lives...
<br>
<p>I got a chuckle out of their site:
<br>
See: <a href="http://www.prolife.org.uk/about/legal.htm">http://www.prolife.org.uk/about/legal.htm</a>
<br>
Esp: &quot;Life, Not Death - Vote ProLife Alliance&quot;
<br>
and: &quot;Equality of all: absolute respect for innocent human life&quot;
<br>
<p>Lord, I'm not innocent?  Gee I hope my mother doesn't find out.
<br>
<p>Now, the *really* interesting part of this would appear to
<br>
be the fact that the ProLife Alliance seems to have played
<br>
a critical role in bringing down the government position
<br>
that &quot;cloning&quot; is banned in England.  Why?  Because they
<br>
want to open up parlimentary debate banning all forms
<br>
of cloning...
<br>
<p>Their most recent press release:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The ProLife Alliance is horrified at the news that Mike West of ACT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has created a human clone for embryonic stem cell experimentation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Scientists are clearly no longer guided by ethical restraints,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said a spokesperson from the ProLife Alliance. &quot;They can no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be trusted with the future of mankind.  We urgently need national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and international laws which ban all forms of human cloning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic manipulation.
</em><br>
<p>Now, I'm just &quot;supposing&quot; but it would appear that this
<br>
is a few-person operation (with some very clever marketing).
<br>
If you folks in the Europe want to point out some of the
<br>
flaws in the reasoning, e.g. &quot;Don't I too have a right to
<br>
life if stem cells can provide that?&quot;.
<br>
<p>*PLAY* nice, we want to show our best side:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno Quintavalle 0044 351 9955 mob: 07968 167 323
<br>
<p>I'd recommend people make up a short list of &quot;points&quot; that
<br>
they would like to make.  If you call, you might want to start
<br>
by congratulating Bruno for his contribution in eliminating
<br>
that British Ban on cloning.  Then you should launch into
<br>
&quot;query&quot; mode asking if he has time to explain the Alliance's
<br>
position against cloning (always allow your opponent to &quot;buy in&quot;).
<br>
It is probably useful to allow them to dig their own hole -- you should
<br>
express your opinions calmly and clearly and listen to any responses
<br>
(you can feed them back to the list for further analysis).
<br>
What we ultimately want to do is tie them up in the irrationality
<br>
of their position creating a fair amount of cognitive dissonance.
<br>
IMO, it is unlikely that people like this will change their
<br>
positions.  But enough people telling one that you need to
<br>
reconsider your position will significantly slow down many
<br>
people.  The rest, are unfortunately, hopeless.
<br>
<p>The fundamental question is why do they value &quot;innocent&quot; life
<br>
with a low information content above &quot;lived&quot; life with a high
<br>
information content?  A baby cannot teach a child how to safely
<br>
walk across a street -- an adult can!
