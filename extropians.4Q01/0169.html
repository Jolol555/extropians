From: Greg Burch (<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20religious%20singularity?&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b7e08e7f16e4@[213.6.54.246]&gt;">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>), Sun Sep 30 2001:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Interestingly, the radical monotheism of Islam has given rise to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pantheism that naturally follows from a rigorously unitary notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;god -- in Sufism. Unfortunately, this has then also been coupled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the radically totalitarian vision of shariah, so that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all-pervasive notion of Sufistic pantheism then doubles back on itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to return to the kind of obsessive social universalism we see in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facets of Islam. As my study of Islamic thought and history deepens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and widens, I keep looking for signs of the kind of moderating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influence that the 18th century deists had on Christianity, but to no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;avail. The history of Sufism is a good example of why.
</em><br>
<p>Greg, this paragraph totally confused me. Your use of 'Sufism' makes
<br>
no sense to me. Yes, Sufis tolerate worship of all gods of different
<br>
creeds, cults, or peoples indifferently, but I don't follow the
<br>
'doubling back' part or why you appear to be equating Sufism with
<br>
Islam. Could you please describe what you mean by Sufism? I will
<br>
tell you what I know about Sufism, from by own books and from personal
<br>
experience and perhaps we can reach an understanding.
<br>
<p>(My source for the next several paragraphs is _The Sufis_
<br>
and _The Way of the Sufi_ by Idries Shah, and several more
<br>
of his books.)
<br>
<p>One of the best ways to describe Sufism is to describe what it's *not*:
<br>
it is not a sect, these people are not bound by religious dogma, and
<br>
they use no regular place of worship. They have no sacred city, no
<br>
monastic organization, no religious instruments, no sacred book. They
<br>
don't like even being given a name (&quot;Sufi&quot;), which is more like a
<br>
nickname to them, and prefer to refer to themselves as &quot;people like
<br>
us&quot; or &quot;we friends&quot;. (They recognize one another by certain natural
<br>
gifs, habits, qualities of thought.) Sufism is only known by means of
<br>
itself. The function of Sufism is to be a 'nutrient' for society, and
<br>
to then transmute and disappear, leaving _alterred_ traces only.
<br>
<p>The Sufis are at home in all religions because they believe that
<br>
Sufism is the secret teaching within all religions. To them, Islam is
<br>
a 'shell' of Sufism as equally as other religions are a 'shell' of
<br>
Sufism. However, the Sufi thought has an eastern flavor because Islam
<br>
protected it for a long time. Sufism's origin is not known, but it is
<br>
thought to have existed in B.C. times. The largest impact of Sufism,
<br>
though, was made between the eighth and eighteenth centuries.
<br>
<p>For the Sufis, enlightenment is gained via love, meaning a (poetic)
<br>
love of perfect devotion to a wise Muse. The poets are the chief
<br>
disseminators of Sufi thought (&quot;Under the poet's tongue lies the key
<br>
of treasury&quot; says Nizami, a Persian Sufi).  For example, here are some
<br>
words from the Sufi's &quot;Master Poet&quot;: Ibn El-Arabi (1165-1240), a
<br>
Spanish Arab from Murcia:
<br>
<p>&quot;I follow the religion of Love.
<br>
Now I am sometimes called
<br>
A Shepherd of gazelles [divine wisdom]
<br>
And now a Christian monk,
<br>
and now a Persian sage.
<br>
My beloved is Three-
<br>
Three yet only one;
<br>
Many things appear as three,
<br>
Which are no more than one.
<br>
Give her no name,
<br>
As if to limit one
<br>
At sight of whom
<br>
All limitation is confounded.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Sufis' quest for enlightenment is a self-knowing, overcoming as
<br>
much as possible social conditioning. One way to overcome our social
<br>
conditioning is by using multi-layered stories, parables, poetry,
<br>
which have a new meaning each time you read the same one. If you read
<br>
one and say to yourself &quot;huh&quot; ?, then that means that you didn't
<br>
understand one of the messages, but you shifted your mind in a useful
<br>
new way. (Try reading: _Tales of the Dervishes_ by Idries Shah, to see
<br>
what I mean).
<br>
<p>Another way the Sufis like to shift our thinking patterns is to
<br>
present something as 'ridiculous' (court jesters, clowns, tricksters,
<br>
for example are Sufic). The most famous 'Idiot' ( or Sage?) is the
<br>
Mulla Nasrudin, and the stories of his adventures are pervasive
<br>
throughout Sufi schools because they are teaching stories.
<br>
<p>For example, here is one of my favorite Mulla Nasrudin stories:
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>A man was walking home late one night when he saw the Mulla Nasrudin
<br>
searching under a street light on hands and knees for something on
<br>
the ground.
<br>
<p>&quot;Mulla, what have you lost?&quot; he asked.
<br>
<p>&quot;The key to my house,&quot; Nasrudin said.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'll help you look,&quot; the man said.
<br>
<p>Soon, both men were down on their knees, looking for the key.
<br>
<p>After a number of minutes, the man asked, &quot;Where exactly did you drop it?&quot;
<br>
<p>Nasrudin waved his arm back toward the darkness. &quot;Over there, in my house.&quot;
<br>
<p>The first man jumped up. &quot;Then why are you looking for it here?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Because there is more light here than inside my house.&quot;
<br>
<p>(from _Nasrudin_ by Idries Shah)
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>OK, I hope that I've described to you my understanding of some
<br>
of the Sufi ideas (there are many more, and I'm far from expert).
<br>
<p>My personal experience with some Sufis occurred in 1989/1990 via some
<br>
close friends that were volunteering their time doing office work and
<br>
computer programming for a local Bay Area Sufi organization. Through
<br>
them, I participated in a festival in Fort Mason, San Francisco, that
<br>
winter, where a group of Afghanis were holding a festival, in order to
<br>
raise money to buy goods, supplies, agricultural products (especially
<br>
seed to replant their crops), in order to rebuild Afghanistan after
<br>
the devastation wrecked by the Soviets. During the festival, they were
<br>
selling handworks, music, you could participate in a many-course meal,
<br>
and then at the end of the day they performed some plays of Mulla
<br>
Nasrudin stories. I was a stage-hand, backstage, taking care of the
<br>
props, while my friends were acting the stories. Not once throughout
<br>
that day did anyone there ask me my religious beliefs or impose their
<br>
own religious ideas upon me. I found this group of Afghan Sufis to be
<br>
one of the warmest, deepest, and most interesting groups of people
<br>
that I have ever encountered.
