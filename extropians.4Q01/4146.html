<em>&gt; I don't think land or the aesthetics of land use will be a significant

</em><br>
<p>The difficulty with this handwaving is that a) solar power currently
<br>
costs two to four times the cost per kwh of other energy sources, b) the
<br>
largest components of the manufacturing cost of solar cells are energy
<br>
costs and dealing with the hazardous byproducts. You need, therefore,
<br>
for energy prices to rise to make solar cells competetive, however, as
<br>
energy prices rise, so does the cost of manufacturing the solar cells,
<br>
further pricing them out of the market. Thus, this is a very catch-22
<br>
situation that requires not economies of scale, but technologies of
<br>
manufacture that greatly reduce the amount of energy required to produce
<br>
each solar cell.
<br>
<p>On a different note, right now is the best time in 40 years to invest in
<br>
renewable energy generation. Since renewables are so capital intensive
<br>
in up front costs (while operating costs are negligible), the cost of
<br>
renewables generation is highly affected by interest rates. With
<br>
interest rates at an all time low, it is a great time to invest in such
<br>
technology: OTEC, solar, wind, hydropower, wave energy, etc
