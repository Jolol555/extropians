Subject: Posthuman Language
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Some recent posts on communication and miscommunication on this list have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got me thinking about language.  Have there been any discussions about new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; languages for use by posthumans who aren't advanced enough to just drop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audio communication?  Some who can hold more than 7+/- 2 things in short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term memory without chunking could use some pretty complex grammatical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures to convey their equally complex thoughts.  As Anders mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in his recent post, having more tenses or modifiers for different types of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge would also be good.  So I could say that &quot;MIT nu is in
</em><br>
Cambridge&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; for something that appears certain, or &quot;chocolate mo is better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vanilla&quot; for something that is really subjective, or &quot;Jessica nal is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out with Billy&quot; for something that my best friend's cousin's former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roommate heard in a bar.  Over-engineering a language might lead to a lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of flexibility, but I'm sure posthumans with suitably enhanced brains
</em><br>
could
<br>
<em>&gt; easily invent and learn new ones if they happened to make that mistake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some pretty sophisticated arguments that deny the possibility
<br>
that there could anything like a posthuman language, if by this you mean a
<br>
language that could express thoughts and meanings not expressible by dumb
<br>
old human languages. (A couple of classics are Donald Davidson's &quot;On the
<br>
Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme&quot; reprinted in his _Inquiries into Truth and
<br>
Interpretation_ and Richard Rorty's &quot;The World Well Lost&quot; reprinted in his
<br>
_The Consequences of Pragmatism_. These two essays spawned a minor cottage
<br>
industry.) To make the issue more tractable it is usually resolved to the
<br>
question of whether all natural languages are intertranslatable. So if the
<br>
posthuman's language is translatable into say English then big deal--we can
<br>
express any of their thoughts, although perhaps not as efficiently.  If
<br>
translatability into a known natural language is not one of our criteria for
<br>
languagehood then what are our criteria?
