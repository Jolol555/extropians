<em>&gt; There is &quot;no reason&quot; true enough except that it might simply be

<em>&gt; the possibility out of hand.
</em><br>
<p>I can also come up with &quot;plausible&quot; arguments for why a Mind would tamper
<br>
just so much and no further, although usually such arguments tend to lend
<br>
themselves better to a Mind running a simulation with minimalist
<br>
interference, rather than a Mind reaching back into the past.
<br>
<p>The question is not plausibility or implausibility.  The question is the
<br>
Bayesian Probability Theorem.  My theory - the theory that says that
<br>
you're just imagining it - uniquely predicts that a certain level of
<br>
intereference will be alleged.  If you consider the prior probabilities
<br>
for &quot;permitted level of interference&quot;, these priors have no favored
<br>
tendency to work out at a personally noticeable but not experimentally
<br>
verifiable level of interference.  Sure, it *could* end up that way, but
<br>
the prior probability of it ending up that way, given a Mind, is something
<br>
that I would estimate at 1% or less because of the exotic initial
<br>
conditions required.  This is essentially the same argument against
<br>
noticeable-but-not-verifiable divine intervention - you have to postulate
<br>
a very unusual psychology for God, where most compact descriptions of
<br>
God's psychology will lead either to total uncaring or to a massive
<br>
intervention to reduce suffering.  Now it is of course possible to
<br>
postulate a set of initial conditions that produce a divine psychology or
<br>
Mind psychology that engages in quiet hints for moral uplift but not
<br>
massive interventions.  The problem is that this is extra complexity, a
<br>
considerable amount of extra complexity, which under Occam's Razor reduces
<br>
the likelihood of the hypothesis.
<br>
<p>If someone is honestly considering the Bayesian priors for Mind
<br>
psychology, just trying out the different *a priori* plausible options and
<br>
extrapolating them without trying to generate the specific conclusion of
<br>
noticeable-but-not-verifiable interference, then I don't think you'll ever
<br>
run across a &quot;natural&quot; conclusion (generated without expecting the
<br>
conclusion in advance) of &quot;Aha!  This scenario predicts personally
<br>
noticeable but not scientifically verifiable intervention, which
<br>
intervention is morally uplifting to those who observe it!&quot;  On the other
<br>
hand, the &quot;It's all a meme&quot; hypothesis does predict, as a unique outcome,
<br>
very naturally and without the need for any exotic initial conditions,
<br>
that just this type of intervention will be asserted by a large group of
<br>
human beings.
<br>
<p>Of course, it's hard to make prior predictions without cheating, because
<br>
we aren't AIs and can't close off from ourselves our knowledge of how
<br>
things actually turned out.  Even so, I would expect that the clean
<br>
prediction from the prior of &quot;It's all a meme&quot; would assign at least a 30%
<br>
probability, probably more like 80%, to the observation of certain people
<br>
making the claim &quot;I know that God / a Mind is engaging in personally
<br>
noticeable intervention which is not blatant enough to be immediately
<br>
falsifiable.&quot;  The clean prediction from the prior of &quot;God / a Mind
<br>
exists&quot;, to the Mind having a particular psychology, to that Mind engaging
<br>
in personally noticable intervention which is not great enough to be
<br>
socially verifiable, to people noticing and (correctly) saying &quot;I know a
<br>
Mind exists which is engaging in noticeable-but-not-verifiable
<br>
intervention&quot;, seems to me to be a maximum of 1% and probably more like
<br>
0.1% or 0.01%.
<br>
<p>And then you just run the Bayesian Probability Theorem and ask what the
<br>
chances are for the observation &quot;People claiming
<br>
noticeable-but-not-verifiable intervention&quot; being produced by people with
<br>
actual experience as opposed to being produced by people with imagined
<br>
experience.  It's not that an interventionist Mind is unlikely.  It's that
<br>
the memetic hypothesis predicts a claim of interference exactly balanced
<br>
between noticeability and verifiability, and the actual Mind intervention
<br>
hypothesis does not.
<br>
<p>And that's just for the general, vague version of spirituality.  If you're
<br>
talking about a textual religion such as the Judeo-Christian-Islamic
<br>
tradition, you have to explain why the Mind engaged in massive blatant
<br>
interventions a few thousand years back, but then suddenly kicked the
<br>
habit as soon as civilization started coughing up scientists and
<br>
reporters.  In this case, there's basically no way you can make it
<br>
plausible, no matter what kind of Mind psychology you hypothesize - the
<br>
inconsistent description of past and present events forced by a text-based
<br>
religion has the unique signature of a human-invented false meme, and you
<br>
can't come up with a significant prior probability of that description
<br>
being correct, no matter what initial conditions you postulate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Spirituality is quite falsifiable.  Try it on.  If it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve your life and open up your options in a way that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth something to you then discard it.  Don't expect to weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that rich and intricately part of life with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality and logic alone though.  Not if you really want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Rationality and logic alone?&quot;  'Alone' is a poor word to use for
<br>
something that powerful.  If my mind really is incomplete, it is perhaps
<br>
plausible that my mind would not be able to *fully* understand the power
<br>
of spirituality as it stands.  But to have my mind not notice it at all? 
<br>
I don't buy it.
<br>
<p>And I certainly will not &quot;try on&quot; a meme that appears to contain circular,
<br>
self-reinforcing logic, as for example if the meme asserts that its
<br>
wonderful effects are only visible from inside the meme.  Who do you take
<br>
me for, Inoshiro?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why should the effects be blatant?  Perhaps part of whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this sim is set up for, or especially if it is the Mind's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past, will be harmed by anything too blatant.  This especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works well with the time-travel model.  Improve slightly but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so drastically as to jeopardize the timeline.  Sufficent to do X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and X being advisable within the constraints of the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are quite different things.
</em><br>
<p>Improve slightly but not so drastically as to jeopardize the timeline, I
<br>
could buy.  &quot;Improve just enough that a very large group of individual
<br>
spiritualists correctly notice it and are in basic correct agreement about
<br>
what it represents, but not improve so much that scientists can prove it,&quot;
<br>
I don't buy.  I don't think you can manipulate the physical conditions of
<br>
the technology, or the psychological conditions of the Mind, in such a way
<br>
that this result is a reasonable outcome.  But the existence of people
<br>
incorrectly asserting this result is a very obvious and direct outcome of
<br>
human memetics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would also point out that if you wish to move much of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population of the world in a more positive direction the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language of spirituality is quite important.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, well, I don't just wish to move the population of the world, I want
<br>
to do it ethically.  I can use a certain subset of the language of
<br>
spirituality because I regard that subset as an extension of rationality
<br>
by other means.  I can't ethically use mystical language because I don't
<br>
believe in it myself.  Even if mystical language was the easy and direct
<br>
way to convince much of the population of the world, I still couldn't use
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality that gives rise to most living ethical systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today.
</em><br>
<p>So?  Most living ethical systems today are painfully incomplete.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have yet to acheive a strong ethical system using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason alone.  Creating a world that is viable and forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving requires ethical, political, psychological and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sociological aspects as well as technological/scientific ones.
</em><br>
<p>Ethical, political, psychological, and sociological aspects can be
<br>
understood using rational means.  The choice of ethics may need to rely on
<br>
the human emotional set as part of the baseline (or not - currently I'm
<br>
figuring it both ways) but that doesn't compromise rationality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe the necessary work can be done with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason/rationality as usually understood alone.  If you know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can be I would very much like to hear it.
</em><br>
<p>Use reason and rationality and (ethical) appeal to shared emotions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is your construction that spritual speaking is &quot;shorthand&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are spiritual images, concepts, experiences, teachings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that simply do not translate into the language of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality/logic/reason no matter how long you speak and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patiently intellectual you assume your audience is.
</em><br>
<p>Can you give me an example?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe in a transcendent Mind not limited to what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently understand through science and that that Mind is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immanent as well and is interested and under certain conditions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least somewhat accessible.  I have little choice but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe this as I have experienced it firsthand.  Yes, I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up with rationalizations to &quot;debunk&quot; each such experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the ones that I could possibly have in the future.  But at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some point the effort to &quot;debunk&quot; them becomes less believable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more contrived than accepting such as also valid.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point I have reached and passed in my own life.
</em><br>
<p>I don't mean to sound insulting, but you do realize that unless you cite
<br>
the specific experiences (and I will understand if you are reluctant to do
<br>
so), I have to assume as a working hypothesis that this statement,
<br>
although originating from Samantha Atkins, is of much the same origin as
<br>
similar statements made by others for personal experience of astrology. 
<br>
Of course I am far more inclined to grant you the benefit of the doubt
<br>
given your demonstrated rationality in other areas - but not, I'm afraid,
<br>
*that* much benefit of the doubt, not unless I know specifically what your
<br>
reasoning is.
