<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;But Tipler's explanation is to say that black holes won't evaporate,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because the universe won't last long enough.  In fact he says that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe MUST be of finite duration otherwise black holes would 
<br>
evaporate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which would violate our current understanding of the laws of physics.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Tipler's point is that that completely evaporative blackhole, does violate 
<br>
the quantum and classical principle of unitarity. His contention is that 
<br>
quantum mechanics is physics as we know it to be, why extend general 
<br>
relativity like Hawking does, to support the &quot;physics&quot; of information 
<br>
evaporation?
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the business of theoretical physics is to extend and even 
<br>
speculate on what might be going on, or what is possible. Tipler' and 
<br>
Barrow's other contention is that in a universe that contains intelligent 
<br>
life, must eventually produce an intelligence, to manipulate space-time to 
<br>
cause a bi-directional collapse to an Omega Point, utilizing the higgs-shear 
<br>
&quot;effect&quot; to continue life onward, into the eternal future. This is the 
<br>
essence of speculation, yet it does make a kind of sense, since even Jupiter 
<br>
Brains or Great Attractor Brains would (I guess) not favor their own 
<br>
obliteration.
<br>
<p>As Dr. Finney indicated, Tipler's theory is not the essence of logic, but it 
<br>
is rational and, I am sure, subject to alteration as the eons move forward. 
<br>
There are certainly other theories and theorists who will have their say in 
<br>
these matters. 
<br>
<p>I sometimes find myself favoring the notion of a superciviliation or a 
<br>
Supermind, creating FTL  links the accelerating universe together, in a 
<br>
manner that avoids receding horizons, and connects Mind in a Dysonian 
<br>
fashion. There are optimally different, but related views, such as :
<br>
<p>Eternal Inflation, Black Holes, and the Future of Civilizations;  
<br>

<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;It's interesting now that the evidence seems strong for an open universe&gt;&gt;
<br>
On this account, the theorists seem to be leading toward a varied cosmos 
<br>
which can accelerate or contract, in a rather, hap-hazzard fashion.

<br>
<p>At any rate I agree with Kurzweil's statement at the end of &quot;..Spirtual 
<br>
Machines..&quot; where he inicates that whatever the forces of the natural 
<br>
universe are extent, intelligence will end up controlling it.
