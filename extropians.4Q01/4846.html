<em>&gt; SOFTWARE, PROPERTY &amp; HUMAN CIVILIZATION

<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_pollack.html">http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_pollack.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that what we're seeing in the software area, and this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scary part for human society, is the beginning of a kind of dispossession.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People are talking about this as dispossession that only comes from piracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Napster and Gnutella where the rights of artists are being violated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people sharing their work. But there's another kind of dispossession, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inability to actually buy a product. The idea is here: you couldn't buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this piece of software, you could only licence it on a day by day, month by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; month, year by year basis; As this idea spreads from software to music, films,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books, human civilization based on property fundamentally changes.
</em><br>
<p>One more looter disinfo-grenade. What he is talking about is a
<br>
subscription model for software licensing. First off, little to no
<br>
software out there is sold outright to its users. Almost ALL software is
<br>
licensed, which means they do not own the rights to reproduce it any
<br>
more than that copy of TIME magazine on the coffee table which they
<br>
SUBSCRIBE to.
<br>
<p>The only difference between the single fee license and the
<br>
time-delimited license is the difference between a year's subscription
<br>
and a lifetime subscription fee. With the lifetime subscription fee, the
<br>
IP owner agrees to supply all fixes and provide support for the product
<br>
indefinitely. With the subscription, the support period is fixed, along
<br>
with the usage period. Up to now, all major software producers have been
<br>
drifting to the limited period subscription model by limiting the period
<br>
of free support for the product, as well as not offering free upgrades.
<br>
Now the limited period picture is complete.
<br>
<em>&gt; ---------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I'm trying to do is separate academe from industry by giving academics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back all their intellectual properties, and accept a tithe, like 9 percent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the value of all IP created on campus, including books and software and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options in companies. I call it the &quot;commonwealth of intellectual property,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and through it a community of diverse scholars can share in some way in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success, drive, and luck of themselves and their colleagues. Most people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afraid of this, but I am certain it would lead to greater wealth and academic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom for smaller universities like my own.
</em><br>
<p>Much like tip sharing pools among restaurant employees, these concepts
<br>
are regressive toward innovation and personal initiative, and act as a
<br>
shelter for the unproductive, uncreative, unimaginative types who
<br>
believe ferverently in looter-type socialist mentalities.
