As far as I know, outside of purported outgasings on the lunar surface, it is 
<br>
indeed quiet. But this has not always been so. Early in the moon's formation 
<br>
it was geologically active, as was the earth's surface. Both were kept 
<br>
active, in large part, to the steady slammimgs of large meteorites, which by 
<br>
hydrostatic shock, helped induce volcanos. With the ceasing of so many meteor 
<br>
strikes on the moon (except for that one in the 11th century, observed by an 
<br>
English monk, that caused the moon to swing like a bell in its orbit), 
<br>
volcanic geological activity is minimal.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Hmmm....  I know there are volcanos on Mars &amp; Io and I think a
<br>
couple of other moons, but I didn't think our moon had any.
<br>
I thought the general consensus was its been a dry and
<br>
relatively solid planet most of its life.
<br>
<p>I'm willing to stand corrected if you can find me a picture
<br>
of a volcano on the moon.
