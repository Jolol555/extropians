<p>&lt;&lt; I wish I could subscribe to Professor Forte's sunny conclusion that
<br>
&quot;By
<br>
&nbsp;recognizing bin Laden's evil for what it is, Americans can begin a
<br>
process
<br>
&nbsp;of engagement with the vast populations of the Muslim world.&quot; Instead,
<br>
&nbsp;I must offer a more pessimistic formulation: &quot;By recognizing the wide
<br>
&nbsp;backing of bin Laden's evil for what it is, Americans must begin a
<br>
process
<br>
&nbsp;of confrontation with 10 to 15 percent of the vast populations of the
<br>
&nbsp;Muslim world.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;I tend to subscribe with Pipes pov (no surprise) but I believe it
<br>
points to 
<br>
the dichotomy that exists embedded in all government levels, that we
<br>
really 
<br>
need to maintain this curious relationship with the Wahabbi-led Saudis.
<br>
<p>I believe this is a categorical mistake and has compelled the United
<br>
States 
<br>
to become involved (in part) in the last two wars. This transcends party
<br>
and 
<br>
is, or must be a right of passage in the Commerce department, State, and
<br>
the 
<br>
Pentagon; to genuflect to the oil kings.
<br>
<p>My solution is fragmented, ugly, but I believe, will be the best
<br>
solution.  
<br>
Bluntly stated: we get away from Saudi oil, by hook, or crook; and to
<br>
hell 
<br>
with the 'natural' marketplace. 
<br>
<p>We need to purchase oil that is not dependent on Wahabbi political
<br>
interests, 
<br>
we need to drill for conventional oil, we need to convert heavy oil and 
<br>
natural gas into gasoline, and we need to convert coal and biomass into 
<br>
either gasoline, and run cars on ethanol or methanol.
<br>
<p>Concurrently, we need to begin to phase-in a fuel cell, hydrogen 
<br>
infrastructure, as well as focus on generation methods (no hydrogen
<br>
wells), 
<br>
but as this will take many years to accomplish; we are stuck with the 
<br>
aforementioned 'dirty' sources.
<br>
<p>The President could lose this war by his coaltion mentality. Everyone's
<br>
a 
<br>
armchair general or an energy expert, but a lack of political willpower,
<br>
<p>yoked to 'inside the box' thinking; could mess this up.
