<br>
was based on, and each version has its own pluses and minuses. One thing
<br>
I did like in this (Hollywood) version was the ending was handled a bit
<br>
better. There was a clearer explanation given, so hopefully it will not
<br>
fly over the heads of too many moviegoers.
<br>
<p>One oddity is that many of the reviews of the movie seem to completely
<br>
miss the point... the reviewers somehow want to read more into the movie
<br>
than is there. I think most people are still unwilling to consider the
<br>
idea of cryonics as a real technology. This movie did a much better job
<br>
than Spielberg's terrible AI movie at showing a pretty realistic view
<br>
of the process, although of course the &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; option is not
<br>
currently offered by Alcor :-)
<br>
<p>I am curious if Alcor will manage to get any publicity out of this, or
<br>
if in general the movie will make people a little bit more willing to
<br>
consider such things. Anyway, it's always nice to find a movie with some
<br>
solid transhumanist ideas.
