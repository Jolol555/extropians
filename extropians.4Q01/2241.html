To revert this thread briefly to, you know, the subject header topic. :)
<br>
<p>Here's a quick and perhaps typical response to the discussion on that
<br>
program, which was rebroadcast last night.
<br>
<p>I switched on the radio just before 7pm and found the announcer informing
<br>
the Australian nation that in Background Briefing following the news,
<br>
`We'll hear some whacko techno freaks...' At the end of a brief summary, he
<br>
went on in suitably jaded mode: `Back to the real world at 8...'
<br>
<p>It put me in mind of several other great insightful moments in radio history:
<br>
<p>1931: `We'll hear some whacko techno freaks who believe in something called
<br>
&quot;atomic energy&quot;... Back to the real world at 8...'
<br>
<p>1951: `We'll hear some whacko techno freaks who believe humans will rocket
<br>
into orbit, even land on the Moon... Back to the real world at 8...'
<br>
<p>1971: `We'll hear some whacko techno freaks who think we'll all have
<br>
computers on our desks... Back to the real world at 8...'
<br>
<p>1991: `We'll hear some whacko techno freaks who reckon humans will create
<br>
cloned livestock... Back to the real world at 8...'
<br>
<p>The exponential curve of scientific/technological change and its social
<br>
impacts just plain clogs up the capacity of even smart people to face
<br>
impending reality. We need to work out how to sidestep that shut-down
<br>
reaction, now, fast, before the next thunderbolt smacks the rest of world
<br>
in the face, all unprepared and jaded and yawning at the silliness of it.
<br>
<p>I should add that yesterday I did a pleasant 30-minute interview by phone
<br>
with Dr James Hughes at Changesurfer Radio in the States, which will be
<br>
broadcast in a little while. This program will be much more effective in
<br>
giving listeners space to think seriously about the issues--but I'm not
<br>
sure how many people will hear it.
