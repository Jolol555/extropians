</em><br>
<p>It has *everything* to do with genealogy.  The United States of
<br>
America is a nation built on the genes of risk-takers.  The people
<br>
willing to say -- &quot;I am willing to give up my family, my friends,
<br>
the tribe that I 'know' -- and risk myself in a situation where
<br>
there may be no family, few friends and a hostile tribe.&quot;
<br>
<p>If you do not believe that risk taking vs. playing it safe is a
<br>
genetic characteristic, then I'd suggest you consider reviewing
<br>
the literature.  It is *fundamentally* built into all animals
<br>
where there is a social hierarchy -- when beta males decide to
<br>
challenge alpha males, when females decide to cheat on their
<br>
mates in hopes of obtaining better genetic resources at the
<br>
risk of losing the commitment of lesser males -- willingness
<br>
to take risk goes to the heart of whether species are successful
<br>
or become extinct.  It goes all the way back to bacteria in
<br>
which there is a genetically programmed &quot;SOS response&quot;.
<br>
Your genome makes a decision -- If the current genetic program
<br>
is not working to promote your survival and reproduction --
<br>
then change it!  Evolving upwards into humans involves
<br>
decisions whether to risk oneself in &quot;war&quot; (to capture mates
<br>
or secure those you already have) or to leave a secure
<br>
environment (where reproductive opportunities are dismal)
<br>
for an environment where the opportunities might be signifcantly
<br>
better.  Those genetic programs still operate within our
<br>
personna.
<br>
<p>&quot;It has to do with long term future of this country&quot;
<br>
-- Make the case that the U.S.A. is 100% likely to produce the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most extropic future and I will agree with you.
<br>
<p>&quot;the short term future of our wallets&quot;
<br>
-- A claim with no linkage to extropianism unless you can make a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strong assertion that preserving *your* income is in some way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more extropic than allowing an immigrant to take your place
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(at a lower *or* higher salary).
<br>
<p>BE FOREWARNED!  I will assert that unless an individual is at
<br>
the core of their being attempting to *ELIMINATE* their &quot;job&quot;
<br>
they are not being extropic.  Anders should be attempting to
<br>
develop agents that utilize a much smaller allocation of
<br>
matter/energy to do everything he currently does -- so he can
<br>
move onto much more difficult problems.  The Extropian motto
<br>
should be &quot;Do more with less&quot;.  When you can devote fewer
<br>
resources towards the things that one &quot;must&quot; do -- then you
<br>
can devote more resources towards the things that one would
<br>
&quot;like&quot; to do (evolving greater complexity).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Extropy game is *supposed* to be about keeping our precious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain matter from the ravages of Entropy....
</em><br>
<p>Randy, if you *really* believe this then you misunderstand
<br>
extropianism.  Extropianism cannot coexist with extreme
<br>
survivalism.  The above argument is the same as saying
<br>
&quot;No, no, don't eat that ear of corn -- it is an expression
<br>
of nature creating the organized complexity of an ear
<br>
of corn, you should not destroy it to create something
<br>
potentially more complex (e.g. organized thoughts within a human
<br>
brain).&quot;
<br>
<p>There may be a pseudo-extropian perspective in which rational
<br>
debate says &quot;I am complex&quot; therefore &quot;I should survive&quot;.
<br>
But everything is relative.  If you fail to keep up with
<br>
the singularity then you face the &quot;weakest link&quot; scenario.
<br>
I am looking at you Randy, staring you straight in the eye,
<br>
saying &quot;*Are* you the *most* complex expression of the matter
<br>
and energy used to sustain a complex instantation?&quot;
<br>
<p>If you cannot lay claim that you are the *most* complex
<br>
instantiation with the fewest resources then people may turn
<br>
to look at you and say &quot;YOU *ARE* THE WEAKEST LINK -- GOODBYE&quot;.
<br>
<p>It isn't *really* an important discussion now since we are not
<br>
anywhere close to a resource constrained environment.  Discussions
<br>
of how one values or devalues immigrants are currently rather
<br>
unimportant in terms of how significant the discussions should
<br>
be with regard to determining whether or not such individuals
<br>
are over the long term &quot;trustable&quot;.  It becomes a question of
<br>
what complexification benefit one derives from trustable
<br>
individuals vis-a-vis untrustable individuals.  Using a very
<br>
*gross* estimate I would say one would have to base this
<br>
roughly on the number of immigrants in the U.S. vs. the
<br>
number who were involved in the recent attacks.  I would
<br>
guess that &quot;most&quot; are trustable and a few are not.  Our emphasis
<br>
should be devoted towards determining the characteristics
<br>
of those who are not trustable.
<br>
<p>I'm going to end this comment for now because it is late.
<br>
But for Randy and people who think similarly, I would
<br>
ask you to consider --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You must give up everything you are for what you might become&quot;.
<br>
<p>If you are grasping at straws now -- its likely to only get
<br>
worse in the future.
<br>
