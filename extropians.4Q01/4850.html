A response to Rafal Smigrodzki, Part 1On Friday, December 21, 2001 3:33

PM Smigrodzki, Rafal <a href="mailto:SmigrodzkiR@MSX.UPMC.EDU?Subject=Re:%20A%20response%20to%20Rafal%20Smigrodzki,%20Part%201&In-Reply-To=&lt;013401c18b05$79e172c0$e285ecd1@neptune&gt;">SmigrodzkiR@MSX.UPMC.EDU</a> wrote:

<em>&gt; I don't disagree here, but there are two problems.  One is that both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public and the government's attention will turn elsewhere.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other words, a program, such as Social Security, will be put in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place to solve a seeming problem, then basically forgotten about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, you are right, governement action tends to generate special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests which parasitize the society. This has been extensively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyzed by Jonathan Rauch in his &quot;Demosclerosis&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't read that book yet.  The title suggests that this would only
<br>
happen under democracy.  I submit -- in agreement with Hoppe -- it
<br>
happens under all forms of government, though some forms, on average,
<br>
grow slower than others.  Democracy -- and I include republics under
<br>
this term here; the distinction between them is irrelevant here -- tends
<br>
to grow faster, IMHO, because there is more room for special interest
<br>
actions and for forming broad coalitions.  Also, the beneficiaries of
<br>
government actions tend to change rapidly under democracies -- making
<br>
lots of people support policies they probably wouldn't under monarchy --
<br>
and the class distinction between the governing and the governed tends
<br>
to get blurred -- at different times, an individual may be part of a
<br>
ruling majority or a ruled minority.  (Generally, in monarchies, it's
<br>
easy to see who's part of ruling class and who is not.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet, it is not an argument against the government as such,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely an argument against the government in its present form.
</em><br>
<p>Not actually.  I submit that institutionalized coercive actions -- the
<br>
defining element of government -- externalize costs in a way that almost
<br>
makes it much more likely for government to grow at the expense of
<br>
society as well as for programs to grow in no relation to their actual
<br>
benefits.
<br>
<p>Also, unless you've solved the economic calculation problem of
<br>
socialism, then governments also face an information problem which they
<br>
can't overcome.  (See Ludwig von Mises' _Socialism_ and Sanford Ikeda's
<br>
_Dynamics of the Mixed Economy_ for more on this.)  This applies to
<br>
mixed economies as well.  To the degree people cannot choose and cannot
<br>
own property, economic calculation becomes pointless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, no incontrovertible moral argument against coercive action yet.
</em><br>
<p>My argument is basically this.  Reason and force in society are
<br>
opposites.  If you use force, then you subjugate reason.  The coupling
<br>
between the two might not be tight, but, in the long run, this hurts
<br>
society in generaly as well as specific individuals in the short and
<br>
long runs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Then why coercion?  In my mind, force and reason are pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; much opposites.  (The Objectivist influence on me.:)  Ergo,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; any initiation of force means foregoing the use of reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Would you, e.g., give up the scientific method or the laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; logic because you couldn't get the results you desired in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; specific experiment or argument?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Initiation of force&quot; is such a fluid concept.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  It's pretty clear in most situations what it means.
<br>
There may be borderline cases, but these are typically solved through
<br>
examining matters more closely AND do not bring social interaction to a
<br>
grinding halt.  For example, if I get the door of a restaurant, say, at
<br>
the same time as someone else, we don't shoot it out to see who gets to
<br>
go in first.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do believe that initially non-coercive systems spontaneously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate coercive situations, and then brute force is needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prevent it from getting worse.
</em><br>
<p>I know you believe this.  That is how this discussion arose.
<br>
<p>I would admit that in cases where coercion arises, one can and often
<br>
must use retaliatory coercion, but this is hardly what you mean.  Also,
<br>
it doesn't even go outside of libertarian thought.  For instance, crime,
<br>
such as theft or assault is obviously coercive.  However, do we need a
<br>
government -- i.e., a legal monopoly on the use of force -- to retaliate
<br>
against or prevent crime?  Hardly.
<br>
<p>I also don't think this is what you have in mind.  Your scenario of an
<br>
agrarian planet that evolves from a free market to an strict oligarchy
<br>
is something entirely different, BUT it involves the upper classes
<br>
basically taking over an existing government.  I.e., you've already made
<br>
a monopoly on the use of legal force, so anyone or group who wants power
<br>
over society -- for whatever reason, e.g., self-defense, social
<br>
engineering, pure powerlust... -- only has to capture that institution.
<br>
<p>This doesn't mean that anarchocapitalism or variants of libertarian
<br>
anarchism will never evolve into states.  Obviously, the times/places in
<br>
history that have approached pure free markets in economics and politics
<br>
(e.g., the American West, Ancient Iceland, and so forth) eventually
<br>
evolved into societies with governments.  However, the process takes
<br>
longer.  I also believe we can learn from these examples to create
<br>
better institutions -- not perfect ones, but ones that can makes statism
<br>
much less likely than in the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I see the causality going the other way: there could be no government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or no government over and above simple chiefs temporarily ruling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; small bands without civilization.  Civilization, as it progresses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; creates huge amounts of wealth and capital that governments can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; live off.  Governments basically consume.  You should read Hoppe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and others on this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Emphatically no. Read your Ayn Rand.
</em><br>
<p>She's not mine.:)  Also, I find her arguments in this area (and in
<br>
others) too abstract and often stacked to be of much use.  It seems to
<br>
me she lays out a good foundation for anarchism, then she backs away
<br>
from it because she wants limited government.  No doubt, some of this is
<br>
due to her times and to her experience in the Soviet Union.  This
<br>
doesn't completely throw out her arguments against anarchism, but they
<br>
are sophomoric.  (Her main one being that anarchism = choas.  Her more
<br>
specialized critique of anarchocapitalism is that she believe competing
<br>
protection agencies would violently battle it out whenever they
<br>
disagreed on who coerced whom.)
<br>
<p>BTW, many Objectivists are anarchists, such as Larry Sechrest.  (Do a
<br>
web search on him.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Governments (starting at the village chief level) are an unavoidable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; element in the development of civilization, emerging spontaneously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like eusociality, or herd behaviors, allowing coordinated activities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and expanding the abilities of the society as a whole. I sincerely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt you could give me an example of an ungoverned society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieving anything significant, especially survival among governed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones.
</em><br>
<p>This is a point of contention and merely asserting what you believe does
<br>
not prove it.  In fact, spontaneous orders evolve all around us.  Even
<br>
before there can be a government, there has to be a huge degree of
<br>
coordination.  For instance, if you could harldy predict what your
<br>
neighbor would normally do and this applied generally to society, there
<br>
could be no government.  All these coordinations -- from languages to
<br>
calendars to other tacit agreements -- have to exist before people can
<br>
have anything else saddled atop them.  (Of course, once you have some
<br>
coordination, more coordination most likely will follow, which is
<br>
something we in the growth of markets and cultures.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As much as I loved reading &quot;The peace war&quot;, I do not believe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could come true, definitely not without technical advances absent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from human history so far.
</em><br>
<p>I don't Vinge intended it to be read that way either.  His short story
<br>
&quot;The Ungoverned&quot; and his commentary on it leads me to believe he think
<br>
anarchocapitalism is a very delicate situation likely to turn into
<br>
statism when the first social crisis hits.  I disagree here, but I do
<br>
think anarchocapitalism, in order to work, would have to be
<br>
thoroughgoing and not halfbaked.  You can't have things like centralized
<br>
government control in one area and none in another.  The control will
<br>
always create crises or instill the notion in some or even many people
<br>
than control is the solution when any little thing goes wrong.  (You
<br>
know, how when rich people lose their multimillion dollar homes in mud
<br>
slides, then lobby for the government to pay for them because their
<br>
insurance policies didn't cover such loses -- as happened many years ago
<br>
in California.)
<br>
<p>Also, since Vinge wrote _The Peace War_, a lot of work has been done in
<br>
the field of libertarian anarchism.  The number of books examining the
<br>
topic has mushroomed and historical and theoretical research has
<br>
advanced significantly.  Just to mention one, Bruce L. Benson's 1990
<br>
book _Enterprise of Law: Justice without the State_ relies on a lot of
<br>
recent (for 1990:) research that just wasn't around in the 1960s and
<br>
1970s when Rothbard and a few others were already make the case for
<br>
anarchocapitalism.  Even Hoppe's model of anarchocapitalism and his
<br>
praxeological analysis of government, though he relies on a lot of
<br>
scholarship from the 19th and early 20th century, is something very
<br>
new -- with a long gestation period from the mid-1980s.
<br>
<p>What I'm trying to get across here is the theory is advancing as it
<br>
embraces more criticisms and evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I'm not unwilling to change my morality, but it would take evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and argument -- not some vacuous claim about being openminded,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but real, hard data.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very good - this is exactly what I think and I am glad you do not take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dogmatic position on the main question that I posed.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think anyone on this list would admit to taking a dogmatic
<br>
position.  Dogmatism is always a label attached to the other person's
<br>
views.:)
<br>
<p>Happy Holidays!
