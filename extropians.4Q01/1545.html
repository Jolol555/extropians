<p>No no no!
<br>
<p>All we've should really have to do is to help our kids to think for
<br>
themselves, and trust their own judgement. If they can do this successfully,
<br>
and don't end up transhumanists, this is not a fault with the children!
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most pleasing thing to me about transhumanism is that there is
<br>
no culture guiding people to it... people seem to come up with the basic
<br>
ideas themselves, just by thinking about the world, and then find that there
<br>
are a group of people out there who think similarly. No indoctrination
<br>
required, as it should be. That's kind of the point of much of it, and the
<br>
reason that transhumanists don't tend to have a lot of time for cults &amp;
<br>
religions!
<br>
<p>Actually, one fine point I would pick with this is that &quot;western culture&quot; is
<br>
pretty strongly individualistic [ :-) ] and there are strong pro-technology
<br>
aspects, perhaps implying that there is a cultural path to transhumanism.
<br>
Maybe more of a firetrail. Certainly not a cultural roadblock.

Look. You've got it all wrong. You don't need to follow me. You don't need
to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves. You're all
individuals!
FOLLOWERS:
Yes, we're all individuals!
BRIAN:
You're all different!
FOLLOWERS:
Yes, we are all different!
DENNIS:
I'm not.
