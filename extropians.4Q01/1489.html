</em><br>
<p>Amazing little creatures. By sheer coincidence, I watched a lengthy
<br>
documentary on ants on Discovery yesterday and when I turned on the
<br>
television this morning it was ants on the channel...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1 - Why do hive insects care if there is more than one queen? She doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to exert centralised control, so what's the big deal? Does she release
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signal hormones or something like that, which require atomicity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2 - How do hive insects evolve??? The genes involved in reproduction seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from the queen &amp; drones, who are far removed from the survival of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hive. 
</em><br>
<p>The workers are all the daughters of the queen, so they share a lot of
<br>
genetic material - the hive is really a big family. Having multiple
<br>
queens means that workers benefit less close relatives, and that likely
<br>
leads to defection (although many ant species do have multiple queens).
<br>
So in many situations it is likely stabler if there is just one queen.
<br>
<p>As for evolution, the survival of the queen and drones is likely tightly
<br>
coupled with the hive survival - it provides the food, protection  and
<br>
services they need, and if it fails they won't get the chance to swarm.
<br>
So I would say there is a strong selection pressure on the queen and
<br>
drones too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would guess that drones must evolve to be better at mating with the queen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the rest of it is a bit trickier. Are whole colonies analogous to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single organism in terms of reproductive fitness? If so, then we have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that colonies are actually asexual reproducers, in that they split to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce; two colonies do not combine their DNA to form an offspring. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it seems that sometimes young queens from one colony mates
<br>
with drones from another colony. So they can reproduce both by splitting
<br>
(no new DNA), swarming with internal DNA mixture and swarming with
<br>
external DNA mixture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, if the colony's reproduction is actually the splitting of the colony,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the production of individual insects is more akin to the creation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new cells in a human body, and plays the same role in terms of reproduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the colony; that is, not much of a role at all.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is my understanding. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The colony would have a lifespan, or generation time, anyway, on the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of large animals, not on the order of non-colony insect generation times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do they compete with insects which evolve far more quickly? Does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colony organisation put them out of direct competition with other insects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and into the same kind of space as larger animals???
</em><br>
<p>Look at all the interesting parasites and symbionts ants have - ranging
<br>
from aphids giving them sugar excretions for protection to blue wing
<br>
butterfly larvae drugging ants to obey them. It seems that they are very
<br>
much involved in co-evolution with everything else - army ants in
<br>
Amazonas are apparently a strong selection factor among forest floor
<br>
animals.
<br>
<p>I think ants can adapt very quickly; they seem to have switched from the
<br>
insect solution of fast reproduction and genetic change to the more
<br>
large animal solution of slower reproduction (of hives) and better
<br>
adaptation (as hives).
