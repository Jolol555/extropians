Excerpts from an editorial by SITU's (Society for the Investigation of The
<br>
Unexplained) founder in Pursuit, Vol. 4, No. 1, 1971.
<br>
<p>The Trouble with Education...
<br>
<p>by Ivan T. Sanderson
<br>
<p>The real trouble of course is that we don't have an educational system in
<br>
that we are still trying to *teach* rather than *educate*.  Teaching is a
<br>
technological process suitable only for imparting techniques; education is
<br>
or should be a mental exercise, and not just to encourage learning but to
<br>
foster understanding.  It should be offered in three fundamental aspects--
<br>
simultaneously--(1) the provision of factual information, (2) the
<br>
principles and methodology of classification, and (3) and most
<br>
important of all, the stimulus to cerebration.  The last is defined
<br>
by the dictionary as: &quot;Action of the brain, conscious or unconscious&quot;
<br>
(please note)--in other words, how to *think*.
<br>
<p>The primary duty of educators should therefore be to stimulate the pupil,
<br>
of whatever age, to use whatever &quot;brains&quot; he or she has to comprehend
<br>
reality.  The best way to do this is manifestly to gain their interest
<br>
by an appeal to their curiosity; and the best way to do this is to
<br>
present them with enigmas and paradoxes, which is to say the unexplained.
<br>
Parroting the explained is a pure waste of time.  This can be looked up
<br>
in textbooks.  But our so-called system is today collapsing primarily
<br>
because the second essential has been wholly ignored.  This is taxonomy
<br>
or the expertise of classification.
<br>
<p>It is quite useless to try to come to a decision about anything unless
<br>
you know the facts, and you can't gather these if you can't find them.
<br>
What is more, no amount of technique that you may have been taught will
<br>
help you if you have never been presented with an overall set of
<br>
pigeon-holes into which you can put anything and everything, and
<br>
the outer limits of which have been defined, and the division and
<br>
subdivision of which have been laid for you.  The Three 'Rs' are
<br>
techniques.  They do *not* constitute education, let alone knowledge.
<br>
<p>The best teachers start each semester with a definitive course in
<br>
taxonomy, then proceed to the main subject for the rest.  Since
<br>
competence in the three 'Rs' should be implied by a certain age,
<br>
books to read and lab work to be done are listed on a blackboard,
<br>
and the educator is then free to devote his or her entire time to
<br>
stimulating the interest and inquisitiveness of the pupils.  The
<br>
collecting of credits is asinine, and defeats its purpose which
<br>
is the assimilation of facts.  Facts cannot be assimilated in lumps
<br>
without reference to all other facts.  All subjects should be taught
<br>
simultaneously and continuously up to a certain level, and
<br>
examinations be held in each and all at the end of each semester.
<br>
Above this level only one specialty should be *taught*, and on the
<br>
assumption that the pupil is by then educated.  The one subject
<br>
that should be added to the three 'Rs' is geography, and this
<br>
should be continued until degrees are bestowed.  This is the
<br>
European system; and it *is* a system.
