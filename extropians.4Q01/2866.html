<em>&gt; My buddy has built HERF guns from WWII search radar magnetrons found at

<em>&gt; Fair Radio Sales in Lima, Ohio. Unfortunately, what was almost literally a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dime a dozen twenty years ago is very rare today. He cleaned them out of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; good thing, as modern permanent magnets are lots smaller than the Alnico
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have also made &quot;baby&quot; versions from microwave oven maggies - good for
</em><br>

<em>&gt; megawatt (pulsed).
</em><br>
<p>its why I recommend places like Boeing Surplus. You might try the
<br>
boneyard at Davis Monthan AFB as well. I'm sure Spike can point people
<br>
to some suppliers in the Bay area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of these can fit in a medium sized plastic Sears mechanic's toolbox,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along with twenty minute's worth of batteries. Not exactly a stealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, but at least portable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;You can get plans for the ionocraft of de Seversky by looking his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;patents up in the US patent database. The plans for the power supply can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be made from those found in books by Information Ulimited of Amherst,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;NH.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you mean the Igor Sikorsky design that was in Popular Mechanics back in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 1960's? I built a few models, but was never able to get enough thrust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get them airborne. Pretty good airflow, though, if you don't mind a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ozone...
</em><br>
<p>I believe that de Seversky worked for the Sikorsky corp. You've gotta
<br>
use balsa, mylar, and very fine wire. I was planning on a wireless power
<br>
transmission device to free it from the umbilical cord eventually.
