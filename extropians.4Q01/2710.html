ofcourse this is wrong and wrong,
<br>
artistic behaviour lies rather on chemical blocking of certain
<br>
neurotransmitter type. many artists use 'mind expanding' substances to hold
<br>
their visions longer - while memory is chemical - reality and response to it
<br>
(perception) is electrical (using high frequency pulses, or rather very
<br>
precise (up to quantum level) phase shifters)
<br>
so to reach good 'transport' ratio they use such drugs.
<br>
<p>place which is concerned with behaviour vary. drugs are used to paralise
<br>
next transporting (transcoding) autosopher.
<br>
<p>as it is with language - art as an language of first _consiouss_ humans with
<br>
speech module.
<br>
<p>bein in bipolar disorder state of mind - which is indeed misregulation of
<br>
sleep and awareness system (one is regulated thru light percieved thru skin,
<br>
and europeans wear clothes and use synthetic, dim light). this causes
<br>
orientation impossible (like on days which are inproper for a walk or
<br>
travel - when heavy clouds are on the sky)
<br>
so the whole system goes down to depression.
<br>
only few of modern depressed people with mania episodes
<br>
(which is hardcore version of this kind of disorder)
<br>
induced _that way_ have artistic properties, so this is not the case,
<br>
while - indeed - many artist confirmed that mania induced that way is
<br>
somewhow creative. unfortunatelly not frequent, and due to lack of
<br>
orientation
<br>
utilizing such propertes is merely impossible.
<br>
it is better to stay on drugs, while being mentally ill isn't fun.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Back to the thread, I think the idea that artists are &quot;in tune&quot; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering might be due to the correlation between bipolar disorder and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artistry. My guess is that the suffering per se isn't the important part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, but rather the mania. However, I seem to recall other results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysing famous artists and their work, and apparently reaching the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite conclusion. Bipolar disorder is likely (IMHO) some form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dysregulation of the neuromodulator systems, so strictly speaking it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not about the cortex (some personality typing systems try to connect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personality with neuromodulator levels - c.f. C.R. Cloningers work).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In any case, there are obviously plenty of great artists who aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depressive in any way. So depression doesn't seem to be necessary for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; art. Maybe it helps by providing wrenching dark hues to the composition.
