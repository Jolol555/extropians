<p><em>    &gt;Samantha first, have been attacked for simply  stating fact.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, I was first to be attacked.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Blind denial of objective reality does not seem very  extropian to me.
</em><br>
<p>It is wrong that [...] or Americans should be ashamed that [...] or they had no
<br>
right to[...] or the 911 incident was unfortunate but [...] is not objective reality.
<br>
I also do not believe her recommendations on how to achieve world peace has
<br>
anything to do with the real world, in fact her advice was as lethal as saying
<br>
drinking a bottle of iodine will cure baldness.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;It is a fact that many in the underdeveloped  non-Western world DO hate us
</em><br>
<p>Yes. So what? Major world powers are never universally loved and never will be,
<br>
deal with it.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Recent history shows that past corrective actions did not work.
</em><br>
<p>Alas that is all too true, firing cruse missiles into empty huts does not work.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Perhaps we should try something else.
</em><br>
<p>We are, this time we're killing lots of people.

</em><br>
<p>The great thing about making pronouncements on long term stuff is that you don't
<br>
have to worry about being proven wrong. I can't help but laugh when some pompous
<br>
scholar says that if present trends continue by the year 2060 this and so will happen.
<br>
Present trends never continue. Besides, to get to the long term you must first pass
<br>
through the short term and I worry about surviving the next 2 years.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;We *do* need a fundamental shift in human behaviour,
</em><br>
<p>Do we now,  wow, well then we're going to need a massive program of human
<br>
genetic engineering. I'm not sure how much good that will do between now and
<br>
the fourth of July however.
