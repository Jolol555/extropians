</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;You seem to perceive &quot;theft&quot;, and perhaps &quot;law&quot;, as something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;similar to an absolute, objective description of physical reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(such as the laws of thermodynamics). Yet, the term &quot;theft&quot;, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all its emotional connotations (&quot;bad&quot;,&quot;despicable&quot;), is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expression of human attitudes toward certain physical actions, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethical term, and not an objective characterization of the actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves (&quot;at the speed of sound&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Copyright&quot; is a social convention and &quot;theft&quot; a term for violation
<br>
of that convention. A convention I agree with.
<br>
<p>I tend to argue formally as if from absolutes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While there are certain biologically grounded rules regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property, epecially the simple forms of personal property, (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orange held in hand is property among chimps, orange on the ground
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not), the more esoteric forms of property (stock, mineral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right, patents) are conventions developed by societies to enable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socially useful activities. Such conventions should not be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easily abandoned, as the communist example shows but sometimes new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technical developments can both offer an opportunity and force
</em><br>
<em>&gt;change.
</em><br>
<p>In this case the only ones arguing for abandonment of the
<br>
convention are those who hope to gain from it.
<br>
<p>I side with those who have actually produced something, and agree
<br>
with the convention.
<br>
<p>In this case the technical innovation is something which makes
<br>
theft easier and I see no reason to abandon the convention to
<br>
permit this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;As Eliezer pointed out, downloading is here to stay. Stuffing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genie back into the bottle is possible but very difficult. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state stops trying to turn the tide and instead abandons the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convention allowing for punishment of persons copying copyrighted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;material, then this action will no longer be &quot;theft&quot; in the legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense. If there is wide acceptance of the idea that music and art
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should be copy-able for free, then this will be no longer felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be morally reprehensible.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that downloading is here to stay but still define a
<br>
difference between legal and illegal downloads.
<br>
<p>If the vast majority of artists are among those who feel art/music
<br>
should be copy-able for free then it will not likely be seen as
<br>
morally reprehensible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In a wider social context, one of the main criteria for calling an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;action &quot;theft&quot; should be the long-term economic results. If it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turns out that it's possible to develop a new convention for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;offering free or very cheap music downloads, meaning more wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for us all, more better and cheaper music for everybody (as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe it will happen), then this is the morally right convention
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that should be adopted by us all.
</em><br>
<p>The main criteria for calling an action &quot;theft&quot; is whether or not
<br>
it is illegal/immoral. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
A new convention that includes artists will have long term
<br>
benefits, I do not believe one that excludes them will.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Which still doesn't answer what should be done about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;non-government funded scientific and technical documents, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need much more work to be produced than some crooner's output.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Such content might still require substantial legal protection.
</em><br>
<p>Whats the difference? Isn't information information?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Each download that is paid for increases wealth, each download
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that is stolen decreases both wealth and value.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; A paid download transfers wealth and creates incentives to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provide content but does not increase wealth. If there is enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of an incentive to produce content without the large middlemen who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;charge you 16$ per CD, then abolition of such middlemen will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increase wealth and make the word &quot;stolen&quot; meaningless in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;context.
</em><br>
<p>A paid download increases the wealth of the provider, and increases
<br>
incentive. An unpaid download decreases the wealth of the provider
<br>
and decreases incentive. (if wealth is the primary or a substantial
<br>
motivator)
<br>
<p>Middleman will obviously try and maintain their value.
