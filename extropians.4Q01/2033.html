<p><em>&gt; It would be valuable to include geothermal wealth in that equation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes but then I would have to change the title of the paper to
<br>
&quot;Energy Resource Wealth&quot; and I'd have to include Oil, Coal and
<br>
a whole bunch of other things.
<br>
<p>Strictly speaking, neither solar nor geothermal are &quot;renewable&quot;.
<br>
The Sun runs down in 4-6 billion years and though I haven't seen
<br>
calculations on the rate of production vs. the rate of extraction,
<br>
at some point using the geothermal *will* cool off the core of
<br>
the Earth.  That will probably stop the dynamo and leave us
<br>
without a magnetic field to shield us from space hazards.  It
<br>
will also stop the carbon recycler.  The carbon will slowly
<br>
accumulate on the bottom of the ocean instead of getting
<br>
recycled through volcanoes and back into the atmosphere.
<br>
Now that &quot;might&quot; be useful if you could time it so as to
<br>
decrease the greenhouse effect at the same time the sun starts
<br>
to enter its red giant phase, but I doubt we are that smart yet.
<br>
<p>There *is* a moderately short term useful effect of harvesting geothermal
<br>
in the Yellowstone area, because scientists say that that area
<br>
blows up every few million years with a fair degree of regularity
<br>
making Mt. St. Helens look like a warm up exercise.  I would imagine
<br>
there are some very interesting dual-purpose strategies that could
<br>
make geothermal quite attractive in some locations.  However, I'm
<br>
not so sure all the corrosion and bacterial fouling issues have
<br>
been solved for geothermal yet.
<br>
<p>The main problem with geothermal and solar cells is that you have
<br>
to have people involved -- either drilling the wells or assembling
<br>
the panels.  Having people involved drives up the costs.  My entire
<br>
reason for exploring this is to see how low you you can drive the
<br>
human labor component of your infrastructure build.  Or how low
<br>
tech you can make the infrastructure so it requires easily trained
<br>
low cost workers rather than expensive highly trained workers.
<br>
Pouring cement for the walls of solar bioreactor ponds is about
<br>
as low tech as I think you can get.
