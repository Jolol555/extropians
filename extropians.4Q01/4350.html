<p>
I thought I'd put my little bit in here...in my own simplistic fashion.
<br>
<p>Autism popped out of a recent analysis I did (I think - If I understand
<br>
autism from what I have been told). Imagine a human's continuous sensory
<br>
streams non-stop associating with a gigantic number of stored 'items' (for
<br>
want of a better word) subsequently called into a working area - a sort of
<br>
foreground representing current real-time situational focus.
<br>
<p>If you want to make any sense of it at all, you have to define a 'region of
<br>
interest'. This is fairly easy to imagine in a visual sense. Currently it's
<br>
this screen your looking at. Now I ask you to 'become aware of your left
<br>
foot'. See? It works across all the senses. It's automatic. Thank god I can
<br>
shut the noise of the kids out when I want!
<br>
<p>Now imagine that the 'region of interest' capacity was mal formed or broken.
<br>
I can't imagine how awful this would feel. Somehow you would have to act to
<br>
reduce the impinging flood so that you could function. The strategy for
<br>
doing this- to the non-autistic - appear fairly weird when viewed from
<br>
outside. Emotion would have to go - you'd go nuts if you had all X'000
<br>
emotional flavours associated out at once.
<br>
<p>On the other side - the capacity of an 'expanded' region of interest could
<br>
be very beneficial in enabling associations that would otherwise be
<br>
avoided/lost. We see/relate this as a 'higher IQ' function. In this list - I
<br>
suspect - the XNTX - factor - I think there's ...shoot me if I'm wrong....a
<br>
few neurons on the IQ++ side and that if there was another &quot;outer square&quot; on
<br>
the Meyers Briggs classifier I think the XNTX's would find thenselves next
<br>
to the autistic/savant area. How many of you out there ever looked at the
<br>
same 'scene' as others and saw so much more? I look out my window at the
<br>
biology and these days I see a heap of fractals (along with all the stuff
<br>
that others see).
<br>
<p>I think this list and the extropian mindset is a product of that very
<br>
process. Seeing more when presented with the same data. It's a little scary,
<br>
however, being so close to the edge of the Meyer's Briggs box.
<br>
<p>Just as an excercise, try and imagine if you had a 'region of interest' that
<br>
could only take in 1 or 2 or a few associations - ie. overly expressed -
<br>
what sort of person is that? You have all met them. They are still capable
<br>
of acceptable analysis when they get the input, they just don't get the
<br>
input. You may have been like it a while yourself. I think I've identified a
<br>
few, but I'd like someone else to have a go. No, not politicians! No Bin
<br>
Laden jokes either.
<br>
<p>cheers
