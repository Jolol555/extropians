</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; intervention on behalf of some of the persons involved?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It could have undesirable consequences because the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is uncertain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly. Even what we think is right and good can turn out to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be wrong in a longer time-frame. So all assumptions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social ideas have to be frequently reexamined and chnaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if new data requires it.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree here, but there are two problems.  One is that both the
<br>
public and the government's attention will turn elsewhere.  In other
<br>
words, a program, such as Social Security, will be put in place to solve
<br>
a seeming problem, then basically forgotten about.  Generally, in
<br>
coercive policies -- as almost all government policies are -- the
<br>
tendency is to ignore the policy and move on to other things.  This is
<br>
why we see cycles of neglect followed by reform followed by new neglect.
<br>
<p>The other is that coercive interventions necessarily create or reinforce
<br>
interest groups that either want to maintain or expand current
<br>
interventions or even create new ones -- regardless of results.  We see
<br>
when any cut back in an obviously failed program, such as Social
<br>
Security, the Import Export Bank, or the various deposit insurance
<br>
programs.  (I can multiply examples here, but I don't want this post to
<br>
be too long.:)  In all these cases, intensive lobbying by the interests
<br>
supporting program outflanks both reality (the obvious failures) and
<br>
those who want to reduce or abolish such programs.
<br>
<p>We see the creation of new programs with, e.g., the expansion of
<br>
affirmative action programs and the creation of new collective rights --
<br>
e.g., for Blacks, women, gays, the disabled, and probably next for the
<br>
overweight.  We see even ephemeral coercions basically teaching people
<br>
that coercion is a tool just like any other, when it's not.  It's not
<br>
because it's effects are to distort cooperation and, ultimately, to
<br>
spread social conflict as one individual or group sees every other
<br>
individual or group as an adversay -- either as victims or villains.
<br>
<p>As Milton Friedman once said, there's nothing more permanent than a
<br>
temporary government program.  Granted, this is hyperbole, but part of
<br>
the exaggeration rings true.  So, we should be extremely careful
<br>
advocating any new coercive policy -- even a temporary one.  (An example
<br>
of this.  The Mexican bailout of the early 1990s led US investors to
<br>
expect further bailouts and other changes, from the bailings out of many
<br>
to US firms and banks in the Asian crisis and the Russian crisis and the
<br>
arrangement with LTCM.  See, e.g., &quot;Too Big to Fail?: Long-Term Capital
<br>
Management and the Federal Reserve&quot; by Kevin Dowd at
<br>
<a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-052es.html">http://www.cato.org/pubs/briefs/bp-052es.html</a>)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Whether such conditions would necessitate &quot;coercive intervention&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; another matter.  Wouldn't one want to err on the side of freedom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reason?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Always. Freedom and reason are right at the top of my &quot;good&quot; list.
</em><br>
<p>Then why coercion?  In my mind, force and reason are pretty much
<br>
opposites.  (The Objectivist influence on me.:)  Ergo, any initiation of
<br>
force means foregoing the use of reason.  Would you, e.g., give up the
<br>
scientific method or the laws of logic because you couldn't get the
<br>
results you desired in a specific experiment or argument?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, yes, to some of it, except there would be no civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without governments.
</em><br>
<p>I see the causality going the other way: there could be no government or
<br>
no government over and above simple chiefs temporarily ruling small
<br>
bands without civilization.  Civilization, as it progresses, creates
<br>
huge amounts of wealth and capital that governments can live off.
<br>
Governments basically consume.  You should read Hoppe and others on
<br>
this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Or is such situation in principle and in practice absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;impossible and ruled out by the very foundations of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;moral system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It's ruled out by my moral system, yes, but I am willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; entertain the question from an economic and sociological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now here I am a little bit confused - intervention can be entertained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a question but is ruled out by basic moral considerations?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and for the same reasons as above.  I would I hope no sooner give
<br>
up logic in thinking than freedom in action.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does it mean that your answer to my first question is a principled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;No&quot; and any discussion is only an intellectual pastime?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not unwilling to change my morality, but it would take evidence and
<br>
argument -- not some vacuous claim about being openminded, but real,
<br>
hard data.  Thusfar, I've not seen much in that direction -- and not for
<br>
lack of looking.  After all, not only am I intensely interested in the
<br>
effects of coercion, but I live in a society where most people want and
<br>
advocate for even more coercion.
<br>
<p>Also, morality for me is not separate from empirical issues or reality.
<br>
In fact, I'm basically in the Objectivist and neo-Aristotelean
<br>
traditions here.  (I might add, I also agree with much of what Lawrence
<br>
C. Becker has to say in his _A New Stoicism_.  I mention him because
<br>
he's modernized stoicism and the result is quite good, IMHO.)  Since I
<br>
also think of politics as reality based, the same applies for it.  Note,
<br>
my arguments in this area are generally backed by historical examples.
<br>
<p>I'll respond to your scenario in Part 2 of my response.  I figured it
<br>
good to send out Part 1 now because I've delayed long enough.
<br>
<p>Cheers!

<p>&quot;Legislation appears today to be a quick, rational, and far-reaching
<br>
remedy against every kind of evil or inconvenience, as compared with,
<br>
say, judicial decisions, the settlement of disputes by private arbiters,
<br>
conventions, customs, and similar kinds of spontaneous adjustments on
<br>
the part of individuals.  A fact that almost always goes unnoticed is
<br>
that a remedy by way of legislation may be too quick to be efficacious,
<br>
too unpredictably far-reaching to be wholly beneficial, and too directly
<br>
connected with the contingent views and interests of a handful of people
<br>
(the legislators), whoever they may be, to be, in fact, a remedy for all
<br>
concerned.  Even when all this is noticed, the criticism is usually
<br>
directed against particular statutes rather than against legislation as
<br>
such, and a new remedy is always looked for in 'better' statutes instead
<br>
of in something altogether different from legislation.&quot;  Bruno Leoni,
<br>
_Freedom and the Law_, p7
