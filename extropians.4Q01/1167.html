</em><br>
<p>I think this a very good point. I fully agree on the basic idea (although
<br>
I think Robert and I differ on how this interacts with ethics later on). 
<br>
<p>So, what have I done to overcome Anders? I think the most successful
<br>
methods have been to increase the abstraction level of my work - instead
<br>
of making a single neural network simulation I have a script running a
<br>
hundred, an octave script processing the data, a matlab script doing the
<br>
visualisation in a repeatable manner. In the same way, on the theoretical
<br>
side the interesting issues isn't whether neural network A or B is best
<br>
for the job of emulating memory, but asking what 
<br>
<p>Still, much work remain. I would love to find a method to facilitate
<br>
writing scientific (and transhumanist) papers. I have some ideas of a
<br>
research management assistant program that keeps track of research
<br>
questions and suggests experiments. I really need to change my habits to
<br>
act on a higher abstraction level.
<br>
<p>But this brings up the &quot;ear of corn&quot; problem: how much effort should be
<br>
put on pursuing labor saving project A and how much on simply doing
<br>
projects B, C and D? Many programmers spend a lot of time writing labor
<br>
saving code, sometimes apparently more time than they save (but if many
<br>
people use their devices, then they save a lot of time and thinking for
<br>
the rest of us). The general problem is really about learning and
<br>
planning, and likely doesn't have any neat general solution - we have to
<br>
learn from experience, make guesses and compete/learn with others what
<br>
works. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The Extropy game is *supposed* to be about keeping our precious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain matter from the ravages of Entropy....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Randy, if you *really* believe this then you misunderstand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianism.  Extropianism cannot coexist with extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survivalism.  The above argument is the same as saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;No, no, don't eat that ear of corn -- it is an expression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of nature creating the organized complexity of an ear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of corn, you should not destroy it to create something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially more complex (e.g. organized thoughts within a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain).&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. We want *extropy*, not &quot;no entropy&quot;. The goal is growth and
<br>
complexity, not stasis. After all, the only way of preserving ourselves
<br>
from entropy would be to freeze time. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There may be a pseudo-extropian perspective in which rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate says &quot;I am complex&quot; therefore &quot;I should survive&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But everything is relative.  If you fail to keep up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the singularity then you face the &quot;weakest link&quot; scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am looking at you Randy, staring you straight in the eye,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying &quot;*Are* you the *most* complex expression of the matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and energy used to sustain a complex instantation?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you cannot lay claim that you are the *most* complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantiation with the fewest resources then people may turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to look at you and say &quot;YOU *ARE* THE WEAKEST LINK -- GOODBYE&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>This is where we appear to diverge ethically. From my position certain
<br>
systems - rational, self-sustaining complex systems exhibiting ethical
<br>
subjectship - have a right to remain in existence. However, this is a
<br>
negative right: I have a right not to be killed by you, but you have no
<br>
obligation to sustain my life. Various complications ensue when we
<br>
discuss the intricacies of living in societies where people are
<br>
co-dependent on each other, issues of beings on the border of the above
<br>
group and of course what other ethical obligations might imply a bit of
<br>
a positive right to life (i.e. what is the role of compassion etc). But
<br>
this implies that ethically even a very inefficient being that really is
<br>
a weakest link has a right to go on with its existence using resources
<br>
it owns. 
<br>
<p>But in the large scheme of things reality doesn't care the least for my
<br>
continued existence - only I (and some others) do. So if I want to
<br>
survive I better act in ways that promote my survival and growth.
<br>
Because I believe we are living in a fairly Red Queenish world (although
<br>
not quite as Red Queenish as some other here seem to think) we need to
<br>
grow and develop - and evolution has also made our brains such that we
<br>
*enjoy* growing and developing. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;You must give up everything you are for what you might become&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>As Zindell put it: You must remember that an oak tree is not a crime
<br>
against the acorn.
