<em>&gt;Question #1: Doyou think the idea of punching the shit out of me would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enter your head, at least for an instant?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Question #2: Are you surprised a man that is consumed with hate like Chomsky
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is hated in return?
</em><br>
<p>Read what he says more carefully and you will see he says nothing even 
<br>
remotely like that. Anyone who said anything so dumb should not be 
<br>
surprised at animosity. But he doesn't say that.
<br>
<p>Here is a small bit of what he does say:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitchens is outraged that I compared this atrocity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[the bombing of Sudan] to what I called &quot;the wickedness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and awesome cruelty&quot; of the terrorist attacks of September 11
<br>
<p>Are you really angry with him because he is indignant not only about the 
<br>
slaughter of the people in the WTC but also other people too? That he is 
<br>
trying to see the wider problem? At no point does he belittle the tragedy 
<br>
of the WTC event. And how can you describe him as &quot;consumed by hate&quot;??? 
<br>
Your words are quite irrationally seething with hatefulness which somehow 
<br>
you seek to reflect onto him.
<br>
<p>I just don't understand this... and it makes me a bit sad.
<br>
<p>Noam Chomsky is not a saint but he certainly isn't the nasty piece of work 
<br>
you and some others here seem hell-bent on painting him as. If he cops this 
<br>
all the time then I can see why he is a bit more pessimistic about people 
<br>
than I like to be.
<br>
<p>The only explanation I can see for this kind of rabid hatred of the man is 
<br>
that the character assassination done by some of the media a while back 
<br>
worked better than I would have thought possible.
<br>
<p>Bummer.  :-(

To the optimist, the glass is half full.
<br>
To the pessimist, the glass is half empty.
<br>
To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.
