<p><em>&gt; You left out another option, the affected artists can bring legal

</em><br>
<p>Difficult doesn't begin to describe it. It will take cops to enforce
<br>
this legal action. Who will get their doors kicked down? Those with
<br>
pirated files on their computers? Those who have a copy of BearShare
<br>
or LimeWire on their computers? Those who help develop BearShare and
<br>
LimeWire? Those who develop the theoretical framework underlying p2p
<br>
technology?  According to the DMCA, it's all of the above. Who is
<br>
going to go and track down these transgressors?  Carnivore? ISPs,
<br>
schools, and employers forced to be de-facto deputies? Sounds like a
<br>
lot of cops and deputies to me. How are our first and fourth
<br>
ammendment rights going to be safeguarded in the process?  Who is
<br>
going to pay for these cops and deputies? Will they be funded by a
<br>
special, RIAA-members-only tax or will the cost of protecting
<br>
recording industry business models be distributed to all taxpayers?
<br>
How will we taxpayers be compensated for their money and their
<br>
curtailed civil liberties?
<br>
<p>Even if these extreme measures were taken, those whose income depends
<br>
on information being an excludable good would still go out of
<br>
business.  As Mr. Bradbury (I think it was) pointed out, consumers
<br>
will just opt for free alternatives. Not only because they are
<br>
free-as-in-beer, but also because their use presents the fewest legal
<br>
complications and the least CPU/disk-space/code wasted (from the
<br>
consumer's point of view) on copy protection and digital rights
<br>
management.
<br>
<p>The software industry already knows this, and are busily trying to
<br>
create technical (.NET) and legal barriers to entry. Book and music
<br>
publishers will follow suit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;But the age of downloading is here, regardless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So apparently is the age of theft.
</em><br>
<p>Call it downloading, call it theft, call it etaoin shrdlu. The age of
<br>
whatever you choose to call it is upon us. Perhaps I misnamed this
<br>
thread. I should have posed it as a question:
<br>
<p>&quot;In what way is an MP3 file NOT like a lighthouse?&quot;
<br>
<p>I await your answer.
