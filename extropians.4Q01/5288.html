<em>&gt; &gt; You have obviously missed an important point.  Widespread concealed carry

<em>&gt; Ah, I see. This would mean, that US americans are about four times more

<em>&gt; violent and potential criminals than citizens of other western countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hm. The USA a 3rd world country? Hm. This brings Mikes argument about not

<em>&gt; trusting non-residents and immigrants back into mind. Europe, Asia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia should, following this argument, not trust US citizens to behave

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hm.
</em><br>
<p>No. Demographically, the US IS a 3rd world country. We have the highest
<br>
percentage of minorities of any industrialized nation, and the largest
<br>
population of Africans outside Africa. Crime is very much a function of
<br>
socio-economic dissatisfaction/disenfranchisement. If, for instance, you
<br>
separate crime in Australia and crime in the US along racial lines, you
<br>
will find that the crime rates of African-Americans and Aboriginal
<br>
Australians are very similar. If you remove these two populations from
<br>
the mix, you will find that US and Australian crime rates are highly
<br>
congruent, although the US would be higher slightly. If you also removed
<br>
the hispanic population from the US mix, the US would have a lower crime
<br>
rate than Australia that is roughly proportionate to the percent of the
<br>
US population that legally carries concealed weapons.
<br>
<p>Similarly, Germany is highly homogenous as a nation, as is Britain and
<br>
Canada, Japan, etc. If, however, you compare our countries after
<br>
adjusting for these demographic differences, you will find our crime
<br>
rates are lower, on average.
<br>
<p>Now, I notice that you prefer to focus on violent crime. What about
<br>
property crime?
