<em>&gt; No Spike, the 'war on terrorism' will not be over in a few days.

<em>&gt; This is what I find so chilling about the U.S. government's policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and words and actions of people there I listened to the last weeks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my opinion, the American's response has reached beyond vengeance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the realm of paranoia. The U.S. government only has to label
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one as 'terrorist' and it's all over for that person. What is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of 'terrorist' or 'terrorist  network'? Who defines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'terrorism'? Is carrying a U.S. passport a license to exclude the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other humans on this planet? What is this 'war'? Is the 'war on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism' a new way the U.S. government has cooked up to remove as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of our rights as possible? Once the U.S. pushes their policy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other governments follow suit. How many of your/our rights have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we lost in the last couple of months?
</em><br>
<p>It is highly unfortunate, but what has occured, in my mind, is directly
<br>
the fault of cultural relativists who have coddled and sympathized these
<br>
pocket fascists for decades. The 70's and 80's saw mideast terrorists
<br>
strike Europe, and most european nations responded by imposing broad
<br>
police powers as well as paying off sponsor states like Libya and Syria
<br>
with aid, shelter, and trade. It isn't an accident that the terrorists
<br>
that attacked us were able to establish bona fides in allegedly freedom
<br>
loving states like Germany, France, Spain, and England, and from there
<br>
springboard into the US.
<br>
<p>&quot;Pacifism, by nature, is objectively pro-fascist.&quot; - George Orwell
