<em>&gt; I suspect that you, Robert, prefer the 'Robert Bradbury path' over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else's path too.
</em><br>
<p>Under the Eliezer Yudkowsky path, the 'Eliezer Yudkowsky path' is a
<br>
successive approximation to THE PATH.  Where the 'Eliezer Yudkowsky path'
<br>
is found to diverge from THE PATH, the Eliezer Yudkowsky path says to
<br>
modify the 'Eliezer Yudkowsky path' accordingly.  Furthermore, the Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky path states that the 'Eliezer Yudkowsky path' is preferable to
<br>
the 'Osama bin Laden path' only insofar as the 'Eliezer Yudkowsky path' is
<br>
closer to THE PATH, not because it happens to be Eliezer Yudkowsky's
<br>
path.  The Eliezer Yudkowsky path states that if another path is closer to
<br>
THE PATH than the 'Eliezer Yudkowsky path', this 'better path' should be
<br>
preferred to the 'Eliezer Yudkowsky path', even if it should happen to
<br>
belong to someone else.
<br>
<p>So far, the above property of the 'Eliezer Yudkowsky path' has been
<br>
preserved through all modifications of the 'Eliezer Yudkowsky path' by the
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky path.
<br>
<p>Due to some of the other modifications by the Eliezer Yudkowsky path, the
<br>
'Eliezer Yudkowsky path' has gone from (a) asserting that THE PATH is
<br>
completely observer-independent to (b) admitting of the possibility, and
<br>
even considering as the null hypothesis, that THE PATH is inherent to the
<br>
human frame of reference, or rather to the frame of reference of a large
<br>
cluster of evolved social species.  The Eliezer Yudkowsky path has thus
<br>
reluctantly acknowledged that THE PATH may not be portable between all
<br>
conceivable minds-in-general.  However, the Eliezer Yudkowsky path is
<br>
still very allergic to non-intraspecies-portable path components, i.e.
<br>
path components structurally rooted to a particular human individual by
<br>
the use of a direct reference to that individual at the lowest level of
<br>
path content.  The Eliezer Yudkowsky path is especially allergic to
<br>
non-portable path components that are directly grounded in evolved
<br>
selfishness or are visibly the product of evolved observer biases.
<br>
<p>The Eliezer Yudkowsky path applauds the Robert Bradbury path for adopting
<br>
as path content that part of the 'Extropic path' which describes the
<br>
scientific procedure for reevaluating evidence, since the Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky path currently models this to be part of THE PATH as well.
