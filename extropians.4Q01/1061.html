<em>&gt; One would have to develop a totally different model of development

<p>But this would be the &quot;moral equivalent&quot; of interest rates, no?  I.e., it
<br>
would be interest rates by another name.
<br>
<p>Which reminds me, I once met a loan shark.  His business did not match the
<br>
Hollywood stereotype of a loan shark.  Instead, he operated by charging a
<br>
legal interest rate for loans, then adding other services -- which he
<br>
charged for -- into the mix.  This worked just like a &quot;usurous&quot; interest
<br>
rate.  I estimated his debtors were paying somewhere around 30 or 40%
<br>
interest on loans.
<br>
<p>Also, his goal was not to break anyone's legs or drain his customers of all
<br>
money.  Instead, people who came to him couldn't get money elsewhere.  He
<br>
provided that to them, BUT took extra measures to protect his investment.
<br>
In fact, he did not have any enforcers.  Everything he did was legal.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
