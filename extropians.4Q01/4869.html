<em>&gt; The Unforeseen Disruption of Moving Ahead
</em><br>
<p>While I don't think this article is totally off the mark -- all change,
<br>
even technological change, has the potential for disruption -- it
<br>
overlooks the massive disruption caused by the Fed manipulating the
<br>
money supply -- to wit, inflating said supply over the last several
<br>
years.  This disrupted the capital structure of the whole economy and
<br>
had less to do with Schumpeter's destructive entrepreneurship than with
<br>
just plain distortion of market signals, such as relative prices and
<br>
interest rates.  (If the market is functioning well -- undisupted by
<br>
artificially created disequilibria -- there will still be disruptions,
<br>
business failures, and the like, but inflationary disequilibria create
<br>
chronic problems that appear not as low level noise in market signals,
<br>
but as systemic distortions that lead to unavoidable and irreversible
<br>
losses across the whole economy.  See &quot;Macroeconomics for the Real
<br>
World&quot; <a href="http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Macro.html">http://uweb.superlink.net/neptune/Macro.html</a> and the works cited
<br>
therein.)
<br>
<p>There's also a huge risk component to the current Bust that was perhaps
<br>
less apparent in previous cycles.  Roger Garrison delves into this in
<br>
his _Time and Money: The Macroeconomics of Capital Structure_, though
<br>
his concern is more with the early 1990s recession and with the cycle
<br>
with respect to marcoeconomics.  I.e., it's not a play-by-play
<br>
recounting of what went wrong.  I suspect such an analysis won't be
<br>
forthcoming for a few years -- until most of the damage is unveiled.
<br>
(The institutional setting, too, plays a big role in how a cycle will
<br>
play itself out.)
<br>
<p>This really drove the Boom to its inevitable Bust.  Absent such
<br>
disruptive monetary forces -- which I believe are part and parcel with
<br>
central banking -- we might have had, instead, sustained economic
<br>
growth.  Yes, some business, even some big ones, might have went under,
<br>
but overall the economy would be in good shape.
<br>
<p>Happy Holidays!
