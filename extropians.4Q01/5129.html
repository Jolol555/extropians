From: &quot;Barbara Lamar&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:altamira@texas.net?Subject=Re:%20One%20humanity,%20all%20in%20the%20same%20boat&In-Reply-To=&lt;009201c18d22$b9324b10$ae2279a5@braniac&gt;">altamira@texas.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As for &quot;absolute colorblindedness&quot; - hmmm, I'm not really sure what that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; means, and I'm doubly unsure what the consequences of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;colorblind&quot; policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't interpret Eliezer's post as meaning that one would literally not
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; aware of color. One would be aware of it, as one might be aware that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person has a dimple in her chin. But color would not generally be a field
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used for sorting people into groups.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I kind of thought that's  what Eliezer meant, too, but I wanted to
<br>
explore some possible repercussions.
<br>
<p>I wish the word &quot;colorblind&quot; were not tainted by some bigoted conservative
<br>
politicians and lobbyists who use it to work against liberalizing laws that
<br>
would lead to more progress in bridging the gap of the haves and the have
<br>
nots in the USA.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; Colorblind?  I don't know.  I keep seeing this cartoon in my head of
</em><br>
two
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people at a party ... I didn't even *NOTICE*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is that such an outrageous idea? I'd be willing to bet it happens from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to time with Internet friendships. It's interesting to note that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can usually tell after a while whether an Internet acquaintance is male or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; female. But I've never been able to determine the color of someone's skin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without meeting them in person or seeing a photo. Maybe this means that
</em><br>
sex
<br>
<em>&gt; is a valid field to sort on but skin color isn't?
</em><br>
<p>Patch of Blue, movie made in 1965, with Sidney Poitier (of course) and
<br>
Elizabeth Hartman.  She was blind.  He was a kind, intelligent dreamboat of
<br>
a man who was superimposed against her bigoted, alcoholic and abusive
<br>
mother.  She falls for him, not knowing he was black.
<br>
<p>Being unaware of a person's &quot;color&quot; (as on the phone; internet; radio, and
<br>
the like) is not outrageous, but understandable.  It's difficult to guess
<br>
what a radio announcer may look like, for instance.  But (I'm only
<br>
projecting) if I were a black person and met someone at a party who later in
<br>
the evening told me he didn't even notice I was black would make me wonder
<br>
... hey, what's wrong with being black, anyway? what is he trying to tell
<br>
me? is the cat blind? why is he protesting so much?  I mean, one usually
<br>
notices the color of someone else's hair - so noticing that someone may be
<br>
Asian or something like that would simply be an observation of a superficial
<br>
physical characteristic (not an assumption about a particular person's
<br>
character, intelligence, etc.).
<br>
<p>I do understand what Eliezer was getting at (what his intent was), and I do
<br>
appreciate his message.  I only wish we were all further down on the road
<br>
obliterating the notion of &quot;races.&quot;  I would like nothing more than to
<br>
forget the whole business, but that's unrealistic when there's still so much
<br>
injustice.
