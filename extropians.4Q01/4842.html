<em>&gt; &gt; Given that over most of the past decade, white males
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; HAVE been 'the enemy' as far as those in power were concerned, then it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not an inaccurate point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Precisely so! ...and it's been more than the past decade... More like the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half century.
</em><br>
<p>Drivel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, read Valerie Solanis' _SCUM Manifesto_ which is still available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in print and in electronic format. The vilification of white males (aka,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misandry) makes the detention of Arab/Muslim terrorist suspects look quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benign in comparison. For every white female in US prisons, there are twenty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; white men in US prisons. Of course, this is due to genetic sex differences
</em><br>
<p>And something on the order of 20 black or brown men for every
<br>
white man.  Men are generally more prone to many types of
<br>
crime.  This has been noticed for quite some time.  It is not
<br>
that men are being unfairly persecuted per se. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; which account for behavioral differences, but notice that feminazis deny sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences when it comes to putting females in postitions of leadership. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the war against white males has been motivated largely by jealousy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envy... the same thing that motivated the 9-11 terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Oh, we are going to do a little name-calling and male whining
<br>
heh?  Gee, what fun!  The war against discrimination against
<br>
many other groups accept white males has been fought on the
<br>
grounds of equal rights and justice.  Are we envious when men
<br>
get privileges and rights that we did not until relatively
<br>
recently?  Of course.  Who would not be.  But jealousy is not
<br>
the right word for anger against injustice and the race and
<br>
gender bias that predominated for so long.  We are well advised
<br>
to fight such bias and injustice.  It has nothing to do with
<br>
terrorism and I am quite amazed that any educated person would
<br>
claim that it does.
