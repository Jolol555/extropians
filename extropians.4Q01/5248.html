I'm going to practice some of the &quot;noisy honesty&quot; I've been saving up, motivated by the article appended. Even the
<br>
NYTimes has a clue to where I'm coming from--I guess it's time.
<br>
Call this a rant as long as you don't run away--I use the word to mean &quot;an essay no more focused than Montaigne might
<br>
have managed&quot;--and I no doubt flatter myself for it.
<br>
<p>There's more than one kind of transparency. The late enhanced watchfulness of all the &quot;single serving friends&quot; (as they
<br>
were called by the Tyler Durden character in _Fight Club_) aboard airlines could eventually lead to a policy established
<br>
by Heinlein's good guys in _Puppet Masters_: skin down or be shot.
<br>
<p>My view is, if you can't trust someone with the capacity to do harm, you can't trust someone--because any person's
<br>
_existence_ carries the capacity to do harm. Can't trust me with things that go bang? Then how can you trust me with a
<br>
vote? I'm willing to demonstrate my trustworthiness. But to whom, and by what right or obligation?
<br>
<p>Whom do you trust, and on what basis? Jackleg epistemology is _extremely_ practical once again. What do you sacrifice?
<br>
Says who? Illusion and agreement. How are they the same? How do they differ?
<br>
<p>[sarcasm]Of course, as long as it's _uniformed_ (or badged--perhaps they'll skin down too) people doing the shooting,
<br>
we're all safe. The carabinieri are your friends. Stand over here, please; we have to check you for grenade
<br>
suppositories. [sound of suppressed sub-caliber rifle fire] Oops, you moved. Hey Sarge, sorry--he went for his _ass_, I
<br>
_had_ to![/sarcasm]
<br>
<p>The actual Extro-related points are several, having to do with evolutionarily stable strategies.
<br>
1) There is wide cultural variation in what is perceived as &quot;coercion&quot;. Also,
<br>
2) in a lifeboat, the person with the gun is the captain.
<br>
<p>Regrettable as it is, and _pace_ Kai Becker, I see no evidence that either of these factors is some vestige of
<br>
prehistory. (Becker's phrase, re firearms: &quot;...inappropriate tools from our barbaric history?&quot;)
<br>
<p>They both seem to be very much at work today, and in too recent history to be ignored. So, on to the key questions of my
<br>
post:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(po1) If no ordinary person can be trusted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a few ounces of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;low explosive wrapped in metal,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how are you ever going to trust a person
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the thousand or so micronukes he needs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to leave the Solar system?
<br>
(substitute any other &quot;dangerous&quot; tech of your choosing)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(po2) What magic turns an ordinary person into a trustworthy one?
<br>
<p>This ought to be an ExI FAQ. But it's going to need a pancritical, not a final, answer.
<br>
<p>There is tension in the world, and on this list, in part due to what Sowell called constrained vs. unconstrained
<br>
visions. As he pointed out, Marx, among others, had both: constrained regarding the inevitability of the outcome
<br>
(Socialism), unconstrained regarding the perfection of the consequent Socialist society.
<br>
<p>Me? I'm probably too &quot;Neg&quot; at the moment to be on this list; I'm no Anders Sandberg; yet I still spend less time
<br>
explaining myself on this list than I'd have to in a corner bar. (&quot;Hier steh' ich--ich bin nicht Anders&quot;, to completely
<br>
murder the Martin Luther quote and inject a few cc of humor)
<br>
<p>&quot;If the government doesn't trust the people,
<br>
&nbsp;why doesn't it _dissolve_ them and elect a _new_ people?&quot;
<br>
--Paraphrase of Bertolt Brecht on the East German student riots of '52-'53.
<br>
<p>This is a mixed post because, unlike many of the more frequent posters, I find myself in a mixed state. In several
<br>
senses.

<p>Naked AirBy THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/opinion/26FRIE.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/opinion/26FRIE.html</a>
<br>
In the wake of the attempted bombing last week of the American Airlines flight from Paris by a terrorist nut with
<br>
explosives in his shoe, I'm thinking of starting my own airline, which would be called: Naked Air. Its motto would be:
<br>
&quot;Everybody flies naked and nobody worries.&quot; Or &quot;Naked Air - where the only thing you wear is a seat belt.&quot;
<br>
<p>Think about it. If everybody flew naked, not only would you never have to worry about the passenger next to you carrying
<br>
box cutters or exploding shoes, but no religious fundamentalists of any stripe would ever be caught dead flying nude, or
<br>
in the presence of nude women, and that alone would keep many potential hijackers out of the skies. It's much more
<br>
civilized than racial profiling. And I'm sure that it wouldn't be long before airlines would be offering free
<br>
dry-cleaning for your clothes while you fly.
<br>
<p>Well, you get the point: if the terrorists are just going to keep using technology to become better and better, how do
<br>
we protect against that, while maintaining an open society - without stripping everyone naked? I mean, what good is it
<br>
to have a free and open America when someone can easily get on an airplane in Paris and bring a bomb over in the heel of
<br>
his shoe or plot a suicide attack on the World Trade Center from a cave in Kandahar and then pop over and carry it out?
<br>
<p>This is America's core problem today: A free society is based on openness and on certain shared ethics and honor codes
<br>
to maintain order, and we are now intimately connected to too many societies that do not have governments that can
<br>
maintain order and to peoples who have no respect for our ethics or our honor codes.
<br>
<p>Remember the electronic ticket machines that were used for the Boston-New York-Washington shuttles? Ever use one? Not
<br>
only were you automatically issued your ticket with a credit card by pressing a touch- screen, but they asked you -
<br>
electronically - &quot;Did you pack your bags yourself?&quot; and &quot;Did any strangers give you anything?&quot; And you answered those
<br>
security questions by touching a screen! Think about the naïve trust and honor code underlying those machines.
<br>
<p>If I had my way they would now take all those machines and put them in a special room in the Smithsonian museum called:
<br>
&quot;Artifacts From America Before Sept. 11, 2001.&quot;
<br>
<p>We're not alone. I just flew in and out of Moscow, where you now have to fill out a detailed customs form. It asks the
<br>
usual questions: Are you carrying any fruits, plants, large amounts of foreign currency, special electronics or weapons?
<br>
But there was one box that unnerved me a bit. It asked: Are you carrying any &quot;radioactive materials?&quot; Hmm, I wondered,
<br>
how many people (i.e. smugglers) are going to check that box? Can you imagine going through Moscow customs and the
<br>
couple in front of you turning to each other and asking: &quot;Dear, did we pack the nuclear waste in your suitcase or mine?&quot;
<br>
Or, &quot;Honey, is the plutonium in your purse or the black duffel?&quot; I don't think so.Which is why we are entering a highly
<br>
problematic era, one that we are just beginning to get our minds around. We are becoming much more keenly aware of how
<br>
freedom and order go together (see the Ashcroft debates). For America to stay America, a free and open society,
<br>
intimately connected to the world, the world has to become a much more ordered and controlled place. And order emerges
<br>
in two ways: It is either grown from the bottom up, by societies slowly developing good democratic governance and shared
<br>
ethics and values, or it is imposed from the top down, by non-democratic, authoritarian regimes rigidly controlling
<br>
their people.
<br>
<p>But in today's post-cold-war world, many, many countries to which we are connected are in a transition between the two -
<br>
between a rigid authoritarian order that was imposed and voluntary self-government that is being home-grown. It makes
<br>
for a very messy world, especially as some countries - Afghanistan being the most extreme example - are not able to make
<br>
the transition.
<br>
&quot;The problem with top-down control is that more governments around the world are fragmenting today, rather than
<br>
consolidating,&quot; said the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi. &quot;At the same time, America's technologies are being
<br>
universalized - planes that go faster and faster and electronics that are smaller and smaller - but the American values
<br>
and honor system that those technologies assume have not been universalized. In the hands of the wrong people they
<br>
become weapons of mass destruction.&quot;
<br>
<p>So there you have our dilemma: Either we become less open as a society, or the world to which we are now so connected
<br>
has to become more controlled - by us and by others - or we simply learn to live with much higher levels of risk than
<br>
we've ever been used to before.
<br>
<p>Or, we all fly naked.
