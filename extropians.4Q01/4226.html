From: Lee Daniel Crocker [mailto:<a href="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=RE:%20Sincere%20Questions%20on%20Identity&In-Reply-To=&lt;129BE00D9DC8D411927600805FA7152802C75043@groexmbcr11.pfizer.com&gt;">lee@piclab.com</a>]
<br>
<p>&quot;All of the thought experiments suggested in these arguments are interesting
<br>
setups, but again they just ask the wrong question at
<br>
the end.  The question is not, given some bizzare scenario, which of the
<br>
physical things or processes involved is &quot;me&quot;.  That's
<br>
just a matter of which definition you pick.&quot;
<br>
<p>I disagree, the most important question, at least to me, is can I have
<br>
subjective immortality.  To answer that question, we merely look at basic
<br>
scientific principles, and they say that the simplest explanation is that if
<br>
you destroy the original housing of the conciouss pattern than you destroy
<br>
that subjective continuity.  It is the simplest explanation for observed
<br>
phenomena.
<br>
<p>&quot;It doesn't matter to me which one I call &quot;me&quot;, what matters is what actual
<br>
consequences will this action have on the world, are they likely to happen
<br>
in the future, and which of them are good and bad?&quot;
<br>
<p>The question then, to ask yourself, is if there were some 'magical' way to
<br>
ensure continuity of conciousness, would you prefer that over a way that did
<br>
not guarantee continuity of conciouss, but instead said 'were not sure, some
<br>
people think ya, some people think no' and made copies of you.  The rest of
<br>
the world would still enjoy your company, but would *you* be around to
<br>
experience it?
<br>
<p>I think, given the choice, most rational people would opt for something that
<br>
gurantees subjective immortality over something that was questionable about
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>It doesnt really matter to me which one would be called 'me' since they are
<br>
both sentient beings, what matters is that *one* of them experienced
<br>
subjective immortality
