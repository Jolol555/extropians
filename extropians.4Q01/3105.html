For those of you who enjoy intriguing conversations, festive
environments, fun-filled laughter, delicious delectables, and the comfort
of home:<br>

<br>
<br>
Cryonicists, Extropians and other Transhumanists, Futurists,
Life-Extension Activists, Technosavvy Dreamers and Those Who Dare are all
welcome to participate in the Gala CryoFeast 2001 Party.<br>
<br>
While others may be a little behind the times in giving thanks for the
harvest; we cryonicists are giving thanks for the technologies that may
help us to live healthfully and indefinitely.<br>
<br>
In honor of the Alcor Foundation -- which has been a head starter in
biostasis and which has ushered in a culture of superlongevity
enthusiasts, we are opening our doors for delicious potluck dinners and
high-spirited toasts! In the tradition of the Annual Alcor Foundation
Cryofeast party, the 6 locations will be celebrating superlongevity and
the overcoming of disease. This year's CryoFeasts are located in Southern
California, Northern California, Pacific Northwest, East Coast,
Southwest, and Southwest Coast. (Please see below for Co-Hosts and
locations.)<br>
<br>
The CryoFeast 2001 celebration reflects the thanksgiving sentiment by
thanking each of us, and all of us, who have been torch bearers in the
valiant effort to overcome disease and the effrontery of death. Each
person who supports the overthrowing of disease to replace it with
healthier, extended life is thanked for being in on the winning effort --
the effort of individuals who respect themselves and their lives enough
to fight for long life. <br>
