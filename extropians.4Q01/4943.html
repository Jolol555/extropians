<p>Spaceships Made Of Concrete? Could Happen, UAH Says
<br>
<p>With 14 years of experience and four national championships under their
<br>
belts, the idea of building a racing canoe out of concrete no longer
<br>
seems odd to engineering faculty and students at The University of
<br>
Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).
<br>
But spaceships made of concrete?
<br>
<p>It could happen.
<br>
<p>A unique concrete mixture developed by UAH students for their concrete
<br>
canoe has team members and their faculty advisors convinced that
<br>
concrete could be the next wonder material of the space age.
<br>
<p>&quot;There's a really good chance these materials will replace the aerospace
<br>
composites that are out there now,&quot; says UAH's Dr. John Gilbert. &quot;I
<br>
think we can make structures out of concrete that are lighter and more
<br>
flexible than structures made of graphite epoxy composites.&quot;
<br>
<p>The UAH concrete could be used to support telescopes in space, for
<br>
rocket fuselages, to build a lunar colony -- or for low-cost emergency
<br>
shelters on Earth.
<br>
<p>&quot;A space station wall or space telescope mount made of this might be
<br>
thicker than graphite composites, but it wouldn't necessarily be
<br>
heavier,&quot; said Gilbert, a team coach and professor of mechanical
<br>
engineering. &quot;The concrete is the lightest part of the mixture. And
<br>
since concrete is pretty inert, it would be less vulnerable to things
<br>
like radiation or atomic oxygen erosion.&quot;
<br>
<p>The secret is in the recipe. UAH's flexible concrete is the end product
<br>
of more than 200 different combinations that were mixed and tested. It
<br>
is made of Portland cement, glass microbeads (microscopic hollow
<br>
spheres), latex, acrylic fortifier and water. 
<br>
<p>Mix in the right proportions, then dry for 12 hours. The end product is
<br>
concrete so light that a solid block will float in water, and so
<br>
flexible it can bend without breaking.
<br>
<p>The bending part is important, since UAH's new canoe, &quot;Survivor,&quot; has no
<br>
internal struts or supports to stiffen the boat. Instead, it was
<br>
intentionally designed to bend and flex -- to &quot;swim&quot; -- as it goes
<br>
through the water.
<br>
<p>Designing a watercraft to flex and bend is a revolutionary proposal in
<br>
civil and mechanical engineering -- fields where structures and vehicles
<br>
are normally designed and reinforced to reduce or eliminate bending and
<br>
twisting. 
<br>
<p>It's even more revolutionary that the UAH team intentionally lowered the
<br>
boat's natural harmonic, &quot;tuning&quot; the canoe so it reaches resonance when
<br>
it is raced at the national concrete canoe championships June 14-16 in
<br>
San Diego, California.
<br>
<p>In engineering, resonance is almost always thought to be a bad thing.
<br>
<p>Every object has a natural frequency or wavelength, based on its size,
<br>
shape, density and other physical properties. Matching an object's
<br>
natural frequency with outside forces, such as sound waves, releases
<br>
tremendous energy and can shake the object to pieces. That's why certain
<br>
high frequency musical notes can break glass.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the best known example of what happens when a large structure
<br>
reaches resonance was the first Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge.
<br>
Powerful wind blowing through the bridge cables set up an extremely low
<br>
frequency hum that matched the bridge's natural frequency. The bridge
<br>
deck started to rise and fall in great waves. News film of the bridge
<br>
shaking itself to pieces on Nov. 7, 1940, is still shown on television
<br>
documentaries around the world.
<br>
<p>In the decades that followed, special techniques were developed to help
<br>
architects and engineers avoid harmonic resonance in everything from
<br>
bridges and skyscrapers to cars and airplanes.
<br>
<p>So why would anyone design a canoe specifically to do what the Tacoma
<br>
Narrows bridge did?
<br>
<p>To capture that energy.
<br>
<p>A boat moving through water sets up waves. Some waves are pushed away
<br>
and become wake. Others flow under the boat. If the boat is rigid, those
<br>
waves set up turbulence and cause drag. The boat has to fight against
<br>
those forces to move forward.
<br>
<p>A canoe that reaches resonance in the water, however, might move with
<br>
the water rather than against it, Gilbert said. Survivor is designed to
<br>
flex during each paddle stroke, storing energy, then to release that
<br>
energy and surge forward between stokes.
<br>
<p>&quot;The boat surges forward and 'swims' between strokes,&quot; said Gilbert. &quot;It
<br>
is unlike any other boat in the field. It is an entity that no one has
<br>
ever reckoned with before.&quot;
<br>
<p>At the southeastern regional concrete canoe competition earlier this
<br>
year, the team found that the boat's flexing and bending also gives its
<br>
passengers a ride that takes some getting used to. Compared to earlier
<br>
rigid canoes, it was like the difference between riding a bicycle and
<br>
riding a camel.
<br>
<p>&quot;We really had to train it and ourselves,&quot; Gilbert said. &quot;We're trying
<br>
to deal with something that's as close to a living thing as we've ever
<br>
had. You have to get used to that actually in the saddle, so to speak.&quot;
<br>
<p>While the concrete canoe team's &quot;tuned&quot; technology is theoretically
<br>
sound, extensive testing that might damage the canoe will have to wait
<br>
until after the national competition. - By Phillip Gentry
