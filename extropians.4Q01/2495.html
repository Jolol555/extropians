Whereas there are several extropian motorcyclists, Jeff Davis,
<br>
Greg Burch, J.R. and others, I write the following for them.
<br>
If you are not a motorcyclist or do not like motorcycles, please
<br>
do not read the following story, as it has little if any extropian
<br>
value, as far as I can tell.  Thank you.  spike
<br>
<p>Extrobikers, There is a product advertised on page 80 of the
<br>
current issue {December 2001} of Rider magazine called the
<br>
E-Z Leaker.  Before you go paying 49 dollars for such a device,
<br>
do read of my own attempt at such a thing about 16 years ago.
<br>
<p>Soon after I got the Cavalcade, I noticed there was a drain hole
<br>
just aft of the gas filler.  If you overfill the tank, this tube drains
<br>
the fuel harmlessly to the ground.  This gave me an idea.  Since I
<br>
often rode across the Mojave desert, and out in places like Death
<br>
Valley, where the temperature is often triple digits, {by 8 oclock
<br>
in the morning, I might add} one does not like to stop for any
<br>
reason.  I drilled a hole in the bottom of the left glove box in
<br>
order to insert a plastic tube.  I could then put a bag of ice in
<br>
the left saddlebag and run a tube up thru that hole in order to
<br>
drink profusely as I was riding.
<br>
<p>Most of the water thus ingested was eliminated by
<br>
perspiration, however some still needed to be drained
<br>
in the traditional fashion.  Hoping to do so without
<br>
actually stopping in the brutal heat, I fashioned a little
<br>
invention not so different from the business end of the
<br>
EZ Leaker, using a device which can be purchased for
<br>
4 bits in many gas station restrooms.  Cutting off the end
<br>
and using a rubber band to attach a piece of the plastic
<br>
tube, I inserted the other end of the tube into that gasoline
<br>
drain line and I was all set.
<br>
<p>Or so I thought.  On one of those triple digit summer days,
<br>
I set off across the desert, drinking the water as fast as it
<br>
melted, which is to say, extremely.  After an hour or so, I
<br>
was ready to try out my new invention.  I tried, but nothing
<br>
happened.  So I drank more and within half an hour nature
<br>
was calling, loudly.  So once again I tried out my new
<br>
invention but once again no success, as my mind was telling me,
<br>
in its own subtle way that my mind uses to tell me such things:
<br>
SPIKE you IDIOT!  You cannot piss while riding
<br>
a MOTORCYCLE!
<br>
<p>It was right of course.  It refused to allow the appropriate
<br>
sphincter to relax.  Grimly determined to avoid wasting the
<br>
75 cents I had already invested in my clever invention,
<br>
I drank still more water and pressed on, until my brain was
<br>
on the receiving end of another set of subtle signals, these
<br>
coming from below:  SPIKE!  Pull this motorcycle over
<br>
NOW and drain the radiator!  NOW!
<br>
<p>I let these two fight it out for a while, and eventually the
<br>
lower region won out.  {Doesnt it always?}  However
<br>
it was a most difficult and trying experience, and
<br>
furthermore, the aforementioned device from the gas
<br>
station is not actually designed for this particular usage.
<br>
So let us just say &quot;one size fits none&quot; and leave it at that.
<br>
<p>So before you blow 49 bucks on the device presented
<br>
on page 80 of this month's Rider magazine,  do fashion
<br>
one yourself for 75 cents and see if you can make it work
<br>
any better than I was able to.
