<em>&gt; See the problem with your reasoning? The fact that some people have bad
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I found the Deutsch analysis of the problem revealing:
<br>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge92.html#deutsch">http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge92.html#deutsch</a>
<br>
(kudos to those who brought these URLs into the discussion)
<br>
<p>It seems to me that Anders is close to being a &quot;moral relativist&quot;.
<br>
Quoting Deutsch:
<br>
<em>&gt; Moral relativism always sees itself as evenhanded, and indeed it begins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a retreat from judgement or taking sides. But in practice it always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entails siding with wrong against right.
</em><br>
<p>continuing:
<br>
<em>&gt; Western values are life-affirming and life-seeking. The murderers worship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death. There is no symmetry between life and death. 
</em><br>
<p>It would appear to me, that Anders needs to state clearly and precisely
<br>
at what point actions by individuals void their rights.
<br>
<p>- Do I void my rights by arguing that we should not be taxed?
<br>
- Do I void my rights by demonstrating against taxation?
<br>
- Do I void my rights by not paying my taxes?
<br>
- Do I void my rights by sabotaging efforts to collect taxes?
<br>
- Do I void my rights by assassinating the tax collectors?
<br>
<p>(One would note that not paying taxes results in a diminished
<br>
ability of tax collectors to defend themselves (and other citizens)
<br>
against hostile individuals who would seek to eliminate them
<br>
Not paying taxes is not morally &quot;neutral&quot;).
<br>
<p>The complement of this is -- what rights should agents of the
<br>
majority have against agents of minorities?
<br>
<p>If such agents of a minority are known to have and be committed
<br>
to an agenda that promotes and executes actions that destroy
<br>
innocent lives, is it unreasonable to:
<br>
- subject such individuals to drugs that would encourage them to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;divulge their knowledge of such behaviors (otherwise leaving them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;unharmed)?
<br>
- subject such individuals to painful methods of torture that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;would encourage them to disclose knowledge they had but would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not permanently harm such individuals?
<br>
<p>I will readily admit that the problem is when there is sufficient
<br>
evidence to justify such extreme measures be taken.  But we *know*
<br>
that there are individuals willing to sacrifice their lives and
<br>
the lives of thousands of innocents for the sake of their most
<br>
probably irrationally based meme-sets.
<br>
<p>To refute this it would seem to me that you have to justify that
<br>
holding any moral position -- even one that justifies and rationalizes
<br>
the elimination of other moral positions is fundamentally justifiable.
<br>
<p>In the terms Deutsch uses -- you have to justify why promoting
<br>
the survival of a &quot;wrong&quot; position is as extropic as promoting the
<br>
survival of a &quot;right&quot; position.
<br>
