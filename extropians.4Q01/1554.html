<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Hypothetically, what if there was a religion (not Islam, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;hypothetical religion that doesn't exist at all in our timeline)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;diametrically opposed to the liberal, secular, rational, humanist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;egalitarian values. Would it be acceptable for us to regard this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;religion as a problem rather than as a valid point of view, much like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;we regard bigotry and hatred as problems rather than as opinions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Have we arrived at a paradox?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some people (myself and J.R. Molloy included) *do* view religion as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem (if not *the* problem).  But the problem with that problem is how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deal with it in a &quot;liberal, secular, rational, humanist, egalitarian&quot; way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The only way I see is by meme warfare.  But this is admittedly an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; excrutiatingly slow way to wipe out theism.  Particularly since religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are like Chinese handcuffs.  The more you pull, the more resistant it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; becomes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. And the above descriptions are problematic in that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumes rationality, humanism, egalitarianism and so on are (a)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only or best values to all reasonable beings and (b)
</em><br>
<p>Can you think of better one?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; incompatible with all or some actual or hypothetical religions.
</em><br>
<p>You're right, I am making that assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am surprised to see egalitarian on the list frankly since most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us believe in things like equality relative to law or rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not actual equality of results, talents, value in particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enterprises and so on.   The term &quot;liberal&quot; is subject to
</em><br>
<p>Yes. What I mean by egalitarianism is equal rights, not necesserily
<br>
equal outcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; endlessly fascinating vacillations of meaning.  The term
</em><br>
<p>I mean classical liberal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;humanist&quot; is often extended to mean strongly materialistic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even is seen by some proponents to deny any real validity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality from the beginning.  If so then it begs the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question straight away by being included.
</em><br>
<p>:-)
<br>
Okay, okay, I guess I screwed up my hypothetical question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a society with reasonable tolerance of differing opinions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worldviews we don't have quite these conversations in my view.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, this is the question I'm tryingto ask. Are there any conversations
<br>
we're don't have in a society with reasonable tolerance of differing
<br>
opinions?
<br>

* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
<br>
* honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
