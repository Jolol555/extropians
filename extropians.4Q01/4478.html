<em>&gt; You may then wonder, why such a small state as Israel still stands and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be the only flourishing country in the region. One of the reasons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are billions of dollars, mostly from people in the US. Without this money, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Israel would have seized to exist thrirty years ago or so.
</em><br>
<p>Kai, this is what could be called a &quot;strong assertion&quot;.  From an Extropian
<br>
list perspective you have to back up &quot;strong assertions&quot; with facts.
<br>
How much money did they receive?  Whom did they receive it from?  What
<br>
was/is the ratio of U.S. aid to Israel vs. Egypt?  What is the level
<br>
of GDP/individual in Saudi Arabia or Kuwait vs. Isreal, etc.?
<br>
<p>In contrast to many military situations of the last decade, the wars in
<br>
Israel/Palestine in previous decades did *not* involve the U.S. military
<br>
(except perhaps for advisory roles duing Sadaam's missile attacks).
<br>
<p>Claiming a policy of support for Israel with backing it up with numbers
<br>
doesn't fly well (at least from where I sit -- as a relatively
<br>
unbiased an ex-Catholic).
<br>
<p>So look here:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://sites.huji.ac.il/jcj/dmg_worldjpop.html">http://sites.huji.ac.il/jcj/dmg_worldjpop.html</a>
<br>
The world population of Jews is some 13.2 million people, of whom
<br>
some 4.8 million live in Isreal and some 6 million live in N. America.
<br>
Even if they all lived in the U.S. that amounts to some 2.1% of the
<br>
population.  Are you *seriously* suggesting that 2% of the population
<br>
can sway U.S. foreign policies significantly?  Furthermore, the U.S.
<br>
population of people of Islamic faith is variously estimated to be
<br>
between 2-4 million people.  If large amounts of (non-government) money
<br>
were going from U.S. Jews to Israel, then it should be easy to balance
<br>
this to some extent with the 1/3-2/3 Muslim/Jew ratio in the U.S.
<br>
Now, lets consider relative numbers -- there are over a billion Muslims
<br>
in the world (vs. 13 million Jews) a ratio of ~100:1.  Furthermore
<br>
while the GDP of Israel was $110B, the GDP of Saudi Arabia was $232B
<br>
with a population 3.6 times that of Israel and the GDP of Egypt was
<br>
$247B, with a population ~9x that of Israel.
<br>
<p>I can see *no* reason that Israel still exists other than the ineptitude
<br>
or lack of will to wipe it off the face of the Earth by the Islamic political
<br>
regimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have probably heard that the U.N. made several initiatives to stop the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing and promote a peace process. But do you also know the long list of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolutions of the security council that were stopped because of US veto? 
</em><br>
<p>So?  The U.N. from where we sit in the U.S. has been known to promote the
<br>
agendas of &quot;small&quot; powers against the &quot;large&quot; powers for many years.
<br>
In the general assembly it is 1 country = 1 vote; not size of population
<br>
equals # of votes; or size of GDP = # of votes; or size of R&amp;D budget
<br>
(that eventually benefits all people) = # of votes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Samantha called it the knee-jerk reflex, and it is just that. The leading 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation of the world ignores international law and only uses it when it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suits its own interests. This is why many people have no faith in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international institutions but only in violence. This is therefor a wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.
</em><br>
<p>*My* reaction (in the archives) to the 911 attacks was &quot;knee-jerk&quot;.
<br>
The U.S. response has been quite measured IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are several militant groups in every country in the middle east, even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Saudi Arabia. So, there is already war and terror in the middle east.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it seems that it was very easy to ignore, unless it came right into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your house. Ignoring the problems of others in an interdependend world is, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we see, a wrong way.
</em><br>
<p>I think you, Samantha, et al should read how the Jordanian government
<br>
last dealt with an extremist group within its country.  If my reading
<br>
of the NY Times is accurate, they shelled it into dust.  So their methods
<br>
are certainly not any more extreme than U.S. methods.  (And this is Muslim
<br>
against Muslim it should be pointed out).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One last example. The US president very easily got 40 billion dollars to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrange the largest weapon test of the last decades. With these 40 billion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars, they could have bought the whole country of Afghanistan several 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago, when they left the Mudshahed alone, build nice cities with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools and hospitals and no Taliban would have gained power and no bin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laden would have had a chance to set up terrorist camps.
</em><br>
<p>The $ amount ($40B) sounds quite high.  But whether it could buy Afghanistan
<br>
bears some examination.  The Y2000 Afghanistan GDP was $21 B.  Typically
<br>
one purchases assets based on productivity over time (this is how the
<br>
stock market values companies).  So assuming something like a 10% ROI
<br>
it would have required an investment of $210 billion to &quot;purchase&quot;
<br>
Afghanistan &quot;productively&quot;.  Given the major export of Afghanistan
<br>
is opium, we would presumably be purchasing a property that we would
<br>
need to divert to other, less productive, uses of its resources, therefore
<br>
lowering its productivity and ROI.
<br>
<p>I cannot accept Kai's claim that the U.S. could have purchased Afghanistan
<br>
$40B and utilized it in any productive fashion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Leaving former allies alone is therefore a wrong way.
</em><br>
<p>I *would* agree strongly that our history of managing our foreign affairs
<br>
is very poor.  Setting up bin Laden in Afghanistan and then ignoring
<br>
him subsequently was a mistake not to be diminished.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; P.S. There is still more. You can find a long list of wrong ways in Noam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chomskys book &quot;Rogue States : The Rule of Force in World Affairs&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>While I have a lot of respect for Chomsky, and have even seen films where
<br>
he documents some of his claims, I do not doubt that he too has an
<br>
&quot;agenda&quot; to sell.
<br>
