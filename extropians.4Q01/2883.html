</em><br>
<p>A gang of thugs cuts a bunch of throats and takes power and Samantha Atkins
<br>
thinks that state of affairs is sacred and to oppose such criminals is somehow
<br>
against the laws of nature.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; The biggest stockpile of biological weapons in the world belongs
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; to the US.
</em><br>
<p>Not true and never was. The USSR  biological weapons program was about a thousand
<br>
times bigger that the US program ever was and I say that without exaggeration.
<br>
The USA would measure biological agents by the pound, the USSR by the ton.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;More nations have been disrupted and had their
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; governments forcefully destroyed and/or changed by the US using
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; illegal means (our definition of terror) than any other nation.
</em><br>
<p>More than Germany, Japan, China or the USSR?  You really are a jackass.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Most of the old Soviet nuclear weapons are still in Russia and there is
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; good reason to believe that they are not totally well-managed and safe
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; today.  Are we then ethically required to forcefully go in an seize these
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;weapons before they come to harm?
</em><br>
<p>How can we be &quot;ethically required&quot; to do something that is impossible?
<br>
We don't have the ability to solve that problem militarily in Russia, we may
<br>
in other parts of the world.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Do other countries have the right to demand that the US proves
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; its intentions and the safety of its bio-weapons?
</em><br>
<p>Read a book someday, the US has had no bio-weapons since 1972.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;Do we have the right [...] it is not defensible [...] Do other countries have
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the right to Do we have the right [...] no inherent right [...] Are we then
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;ethically required [...]
</em><br>
<p>You keep spewing out this crap, as if they had objective answers.
