<p>No geologist, but I can speak as a microbiologist.  All known life requires
<br>
carbon *period*.  If Anders/Daniel are right and the exercise in Sweeden
<br>
was into cracked granite, I'm dubious of expecting to find any oil underneath
<br>
it.  Most granite comes from molten intrusions from below.  No large carbon
<br>
sources to be found in it.  In carbonate rocks (e.g. limestone), peat bogs
<br>
buried under basaltic lava flows and accumulating sediments burying
<br>
organic material -- you have a source of carbon.  But *not* in granite.
<br>
Yes, I suppose you could argue a carbonaceous chondrite could impact
<br>
and leave behind a large amount of carbon, but I would expect most of
<br>
it to get turned into CO2 on impact.
<br>
<p>I don't disagree with Mike that there may be a lot of undiscovered
<br>
oil out there.  I'm unsure as to whether Gold said the best place
<br>
to look for oil was in granitic rocks (if so that makes little sense).
<br>
I *am* sure that Gold is promoting the concept of nanobacteria and that
<br>
a recent review of the feasiblity of nanobacteria by a NAS panel found
<br>
that their existence (based on &quot;known&quot; architectures for life) was
<br>
pretty darn close to impossible.  So a lot of handwaving is required
<br>
to tie oil &amp; nanobacteria together.  Now, that isn't to say that oil
<br>
isn't to be found in locations like those I outline above, some of
<br>
which are not considered to be &quot;conventional&quot; locations in which oil
<br>
&quot;should&quot; be found.
<br>
<p>However, leaving aside the oil debate for a minute, I'll simply point
<br>
out that the current consumption of fossil fuels *AND* the beaming
<br>
the energy to the Earth from the moon do not appear to me to be
<br>
&quot;recommended&quot; solutions.  Why?  Because you are messing up the
<br>
ecological balance of the planet.  We know we could potentially
<br>
have on a habitable planet with the CO2 levels in the atmosphere
<br>
several centuries ago (at least on multi-100-thousand year timescales).
<br>
We *don't* know if we have a planet which is habitable for the long
<br>
term with the current CO2 atmospheric levels *or* in a situation
<br>
where the Earth is receiving (and having to *radiate*) significantly
<br>
more energy than it currently absorbs from the sun [which is what
<br>
happens if you collect the energy on the moon and beam it to Earth].
<br>
<p>So *unless* your energy plans include sprinkling white styrofoam
<br>
beads over much of the ocean's surface area or building cooling
<br>
towers into the stratosphere, I think you should consider that
<br>
a fossil fuel based energy supply and off-planet harvested energy
<br>
are really *bad* ideas.  And before you start suggesting &quot;engineered&quot;
<br>
solutions (yea, I know you guys like to do this, just like me)
<br>
you better ask yourselves *how* good your computer models are and
<br>
what the limits are on climate predictability due to chaos effects?
<br>
<p>I know some would say that in &quot;bad&quot; situations that economic conditions
<br>
would change (e.g. if global warming gets really serious, we put a
<br>
big tax on fossil fuels).  But you run the risk of what happens
<br>
if there are catastrophic triggers?  If global warming is just
<br>
enough to trigger the methane hydrates on the ocean floors to
<br>
vaporize things could get very bad very quickly -- much quicker
<br>
than economic adjustments could fix things.
<br>
<p>Its the catastrophic risks where our knowledge base is really poor, e.g.
<br>
gamma ray bursts, asteroid impacts, methane hydrate stability, ocean
<br>
current stability, etc.  that you need to take into account when
<br>
thinking about these situations before you promote various ideas.
<br>
Remember -- we *are* on the Titanic its just a question of whether
<br>
or not it sinks before we have the technology to plug the various
<br>
holes in the hull and can prevent further icebergs from hitting us.
