Robo Doc Gets An Eyefull
<br>
<a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/robot-01j.html">http://www.spacedaily.com/news/robot-01j.html</a>
<br>
A five-minute vision test using a laptop computer with a touch-sensitive
<br>
screen can be used on Earth and in space to help diagnose the onset of eye
<br>
diseases and even certain types of brain tumors.
<br>
With one eye covered, a person sits in front of a computer screen divided into
<br>
a grid. The subject stares at a central spot on the touch-sensitive screen
<br>
and, using a finger, outlines missing areas of the grid. The computer records,
<br>
processes and displays a 3-D image of the subject's visual field. The test for
<br>
each eye takes about 4 to 5 minutes.
<br>
<p>&quot;As NASA moves forward to establish a permanent presence in space, this may be
<br>
considered a breakthrough step for the creation of an autonomous onboard
<br>
physician,&quot; said Dr. Wolfgang Fink, physicist and senior member of the
<br>
technical staff at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is a non- invasive, quick and easy process that gives astronauts and
<br>
physicians on the ground an almost instant auto diagnosis. This type of
<br>
technology will be useful for long-term space missions where early detection
<br>
and advance monitoring will be key to the health of the astronauts.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fink, a visiting research assistant professor of ophthalmology at the
<br>
University of Southern California, Los Angeles, developed the 3-D
<br>
Computer-Based Threshold Amsler Grid Test as part of his post-doctoral
<br>
research while at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, with his
<br>
colleague Dr. Alfredo Sadun, Thornton professor of ophthalmology at USC.
<br>
Caltech manages JPL for NASA.
<br>
<p>&quot;This new test is not only more revealing than standard visual field tests,
<br>
but it is also much quicker and simpler than existing methods. This test may
<br>
make visiting an ophthalmologist cost-effective, convenient and fast, giving
<br>
the doctor a tool to do a better job,&quot; said Sadun.
<br>
<p>This tool has been undergoing testing in clinical trials that began last year
<br>
at the Doheny Eye Institute, Keck School of Medicine at USC. Trial results
<br>
show that the screening test helps detect a variety of eye conditions, such as
<br>
glaucoma and macular degeneration-- the two leading causes of blindness. Early
<br>
detection of these conditions and appropriate treatment are crucial in
<br>
preventing further loss of sight.
<br>
<p>Caltech has filed a full patent on the screening test, and several companies
<br>
have expressed interest in licensing the technology that may become
<br>
commercially available as early as next year.
<br>
<p>Future uses envisioned are: monitoring the effects of intracranial pressure
<br>
elevation in low-gravity environments and evaluation of possible stroke onset
<br>
and of acute and chronic stroke conditions.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
