<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     &gt; The question presupposes that cultural engineering is *possible*. With

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd say cultural engineering is almost impossible but not quite, there is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; successful case.  Japan was probably the most militaristic state on the planet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it was virtually medieval with woman treated like chattel; in a very short time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it was transferred into a modern democratic nation and probably the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; pacifistic on the planet with an obsession for baseball and golf. I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; if it should be called &quot;engineering&quot; however, we may just have gotten lucky.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's all a matter of mojo, John. With the twin spires of Hiroshima and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nagasaki, the Japanese people finally realized that their high jefe, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; god on earth, Hirohito, just didn't have the mojo compared to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Americans, so obviously the American Way was a better way to conquer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world: economically, with generous helpings of photo-tourism and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worshipful attitude to the American Past-Time of baseball.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope to hell that you are kidding.  If not I think you are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very scary man.
</em><br>
<p>It is frightening of how ignorant of other cultures and history you
<br>
actually are.
<br>
<p>'splain to me why it was that MacArthur was treated by the Japanese
<br>
people with the sort of respect that they only gave to the Emperor prior
<br>
to their defeat?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is why I, like Spike, advocate the use of overwhelming force in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; war: the enemy needs to KNOW, all the way down to his gonads, that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way is utterly wrong and ours is utterly right before he will accept the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sort of surrender we need to ensure that we don't have to fight them all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over again a few decades later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you actually believe that might makes right?
</em><br>
<p>No, might is irrelevant to right, it is simply a tool for changing the
<br>
minds of those psychotically/suicidally bent on your destruction. Force
<br>
itself is a tool of psychological warfare, because in the end, all war
<br>
is psychological in nature.
