Winbond Launches Industry's First Single-Chip Text-To-Speech Solution
<br>
<a href="http://www.winbond.com.tw/e-winbondhtm/team/news.asp#01">http://www.winbond.com.tw/e-winbondhtm/team/news.asp#01</a>
<br>
IC Utilizes Actual Speech Samples That Enable More Realistic Speech Synthesis
<br>
for Low-Resource Consumer Applications
<br>
<p>Winbond Electronics Corporation America (WECA), a leading supplier of
<br>
semiconductor solutions, today introduced  the WTS701, the industry's first
<br>
single chip IC that converts Text-To-Speech (TTS). The IC uses a concatenation
<br>
algorithm combined with Winbond's proprietary Multi-Level Storage (MLS)
<br>
technology, providing a significant advancement in this technology by enabling
<br>
OEMs to provide TTS functionality to applications that utilize minimal
<br>
computing and memory resources. This means that TTS is now available without
<br>
using microprocessors, PCs or computers. Completely programmable, the chip is
<br>
capable of supporting any number of languages. Initially, U.S. English and
<br>
Mandarin are available. The WTS701 is currently available for sampling and is
<br>
priced at under $10.00 U.S. in volume quantities. Volume quantities are
<br>
expected to be available in first quarter of 2002.
<br>
<p>The WTS701 accepts ASCII (Unicode for Mandarin language) input via a serial
<br>
SPI port and converts this to spoken audio via an analog output or digital
<br>
CODEC output. The chip features a small footprint, making it ideal for a wide
<br>
variety of communications and consumer applications that can be enhanced with
<br>
text-to-speech synthesis. Among many applications, the chip can be used to
<br>
read email, SMS messages, instant messages, Web pages, news, weather, sports,
<br>
and stock quotes; as well as to deliver e-commerce information or directions
<br>
with the aid of a GPS location device or other network. It may also be used in
<br>
learning-aids, products for the visually impaired, e-books, toys and other
<br>
entertainment devices.
<br>
<p>TTS chip solutions on the market today typically employ speech synthesis based
<br>
on computer-generated models. The WTS701 creates a more natural human sounding
<br>
speech by converting text to speech using recorded human speech samples. This
<br>
ensures that the output is a recognizable human voice, unlike
<br>
computer-generated synthesis. Processing for the WTS701 is performed by,
<br>
'concatenating' pre-stored acoustic elements into words. The chip contains two
<br>
memory arrays; one for the acoustic library and one for the processor program,
<br>
enabling user customization for special characters such as SMS icons or chat
<br>
emoticons.
<br>
<p>The WTS701 also offers a number of other features including an A/D converter
<br>
for sending audio data over an audio PCM bus, and speaker driver circuitry for
<br>
analog outputs. Device characteristics include +2.7 to 3.3 Volt power supply,
<br>
low power consumption, 56 pin TSOP package and an industrial temperature range
<br>
of minus 40 degrees to 85 degrees Celsius. The WTS701 is platformindependent
<br>
and will connect to any baseband DSP or host controller using a simple serial
<br>
interface. This enables OEMs to reduce time to market while offering a
<br>
low-resource, single-chip solution for embedded applications.
<br>
<p>The small size and low power consumption enable the WTS701 to be easily
<br>
integrated into such applications as mobile phones, hands-free accessories and
<br>
other mobile devices, with minimal effect on power consumption or development
<br>
time. Many applications currently on the market today feature very small
<br>
display screens that are unsafe for viewing as users often access information
<br>
while driving.

<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
