<p>The Taliban was the de facto government of Afghanistan, and is
<br>
considered to be only distinguishable from the al Qaeda by the fact that
<br>
the Taliban are exclusively Afghans and al Qaeda is generally
<br>
exclusively non-afghan. Al Qaeda has operated for years as the training
<br>
and security and foreign covert ops arm of the Taliban government, so
<br>
any action by them is an act of the Taliban government. 
<br>
<p>Trying to claim that the Taliban government was not responsible for 911
<br>
is like trying to claim that JFK was not responsible for the Bay of
<br>
Pigs.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the al Qaeda organization had declared war on the US many
<br>
years prior to 911, so your 'conditions of war' caveat entirely fits
<br>
these circumstances.
