<p>To which Charlie responded with a summary of the history of the
<br>
region.  (Yes, Charlie(!) -- *keep* reminding us of how we have
<br>
contributed to the situation.  We definately wrote part of the
<br>
recipe for part of the stew now on the table and need to avoid
<br>
doing so in the future.  I wonder if the U.S. military is
<br>
getting tired of cleaning up the messes left behind by the CIA.)
<br>
<p>I'll only add my 2 cents worth from previous posts that a
<br>
couple of concepts central to Islam (polygamy and the
<br>
idea that interest may not be collected on loans) *may*
<br>
be associated with the perceived inequalities, injustices
<br>
and poverty.
<br>
<p>I'll add one more that just occured to me which is that
<br>
it seems Islam (or at least some branches of it) actively
<br>
seeks to disempower women.  Emperical evidence (from The
<br>
Hunger Project) strongly suggests that you cannot solve
<br>
fundamental problems associated with poverty -- such as
<br>
malnutrition - which contributes to lower intelligence,
<br>
increased susceptibility to disease, high infant mortality
<br>
rates, etc. until you deal with *empowering* women.
<br>
<p>So, if we are going to make a long term contribution to
<br>
the region -- we are going to *have* to come to grips
<br>
with three fundamental issues -- disempowerment of women,
<br>
laws that discourage efficient forms of capitalism
<br>
and polygamy.  I see the U.S. doing at least one of those
<br>
with recent statments by the President and Mrs. Bush.

<p>A main supply line between between Uzbekistan and some of
<br>
the places in Afghanistan where food is in shortest supply is
<br>
the &quot;Friendship Bridge&quot; to Uzbekistan.  The government of
<br>
Uzbekistan closed it over 4 years ago due to perceived
<br>
security risks associated with the Taliban regime.
<br>
<p>I will note Samantha, that it is *not* &quot;our&quot; bridge and
<br>
that &quot;we&quot; did not close it.  Nor are &quot;we&quot; responsible
<br>
for the 4 year drought that has put so many Afghanii's
<br>
at risk.  Now, officials are already trying to convince
<br>
the goverment of Uzbekistan to reopen it.  See:
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1658000/1658210.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1658000/1658210.stm</a>
<br>
<p>The question is -- would you condone the use of military
<br>
force to reopen it?
<br>
<p>I'll note on a slightly more positive note that I believe
<br>
that Canada has sent several teams of snow clearing
<br>
experts to the region -- the question is whether their
<br>
security can be guaranteed or whether they will end being
<br>
murdured by armed militia such as the 4 reporters killed
<br>
several days ago.
