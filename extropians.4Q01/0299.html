Those wishing to kill large numbers would want to use not quick to sicken and
<br>
kill but slow to sicken  organisms.  That way days or weeks of infection can
<br>
occur before the need for treatment becomes obvious.
<br>
<p>Like when paraquat symptoms show up most of the damage is already done.
<br>
<p>Mushroom toxin can take out livers a week or more after exposure.
<br>
<p>AIDS can be latent for months and only when immune system damage is well
<br>
underway would any alarm be sounded.... far too late to save most people
<br>
especially if the numbers exposed are hundreds of thousands or millions.
<br>
<p>If there is any upside to all of this at all it would be that the military
<br>
would undertake massive R&amp;D into molecular genetics and  although the cost
<br>
might be higher than if done in the private sector  like the past military
<br>
derived technologies... such as ARPA net which matured into the internet
<br>
there might be good to come out of all this imminent  bio-terrorism???

<em>&gt; &gt; Debora MacKenzie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bubonic plague, the bacterium blamed for the Black Death of medieval
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Europe and now a potential biological weapon, has had its entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genome sequenced. The genes seem to be &quot;unusually fluid&quot;, readily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; re-arranging themselves and picking up new genes from other microbes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That could mean that more virulent strains of plague might emerge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; More ominously, it suggests that enhanced strains might be relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; easy to develop as weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The bacillus that causes bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis, commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infects rodents in Asia, Africa and the Americas. But it occasionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spreads to humans, with lethal effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It does so by infecting both insects and mammals. Fleas that feed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infected rodents swallow the bacteria, which infect and block their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; midguts. The starving fleas feed voraciously, but only regurgitate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the blood they try to swallow - along with the bacteria. So plague
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spreads among rodents, often causing only mild disease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If the infected flea bites a human, however, up to half the victims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; die, unless treated with antibiotics. If the bacteria invade the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lungs of such patients, and they cough them out, nearby people may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; catch &quot;pneumonic&quot; plague. This is always fatal without treatment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Pneumonic plague is the form feared as a potential biological weapon,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as it can be released as an aerosol and can spread directly among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans, without the intervention of fleas. The Soviet Union developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such a plague weapon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Pathogenicity islands&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The gene sequence of Yersinia pestis, produced by Julian Parkhill of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Sanger Centre in Cambridge, UK and colleagues, shows how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bacillus learned to infect both insects and mammals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It picked up genes directly from baculoviruses that infect insects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; including one for a toxin that damages the midgut. It also acquired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;pathogenicity islands&quot;, assemblages of genes from other bacteria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that help cause human disease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The sequence also reveals novel surface molecules, which might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; provide new ways to attack plague. But &quot;this genome displays unusual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fluidity,&quot; comment Stewart Cole and Carmen Buchreiser in Nature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where the genome is published. Numerous Yersinia genes have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; copied backwards and have swapped positions within the genome,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sometimes creating different variants in the same population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; These recombinations could mean differences in virulence in a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; batch of plague, they note. That could also mean that the bacteria -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or bioweapons developers - have the genes at their disposal for new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and potentially nastier strains of disease.
