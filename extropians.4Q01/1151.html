I suspect this will not happen if nothing else the welfare state in
<br>
developed countries will result in net immigration of skill less individuals.
<br>
<p>Neal Stephenson most likely got it right in &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; in which
<br>
individuals opt for private closed societies and government gives up, not
<br>
that it is going to give up its power easily. Or perhaps it will, I was
<br>
amazed how fast our leaders tucked their tails behind them and ran with one
<br>
little bio war event. These are the guys ordering our military guys into a
<br>
high risk war even the Russians got plastered in and our elected officials
<br>
turn out to be full scale chickens. Great example for the troops.
