Michael West and the doctor who donated the skin cells to make
<br>
the embryos were on the Today show this morning.  The doctor
<br>
was crippled in a biking accident, so I think the empathy card
<br>
was played well.  I thought Dr. West could have done better when
<br>
he was asked which diseases could be treated with stem cells.
<br>
He should have had a long list that he can rapidly recite from
<br>
memory.
<br>
<p>Here is a CNN report:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/11/26/human.cloning/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/11/26/human.cloning/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>Of note:
<br>
<em>&gt; Last summer, the House of Representatives voted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ban human cloning and set penalties of up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine for those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convicted of attempting to clone humans. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The measure was never taken up by the Senate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so it never became law. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Over the weekend, several lawmakers said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; West's announcement could prompt the Senate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take up the legislation. 
</em><br>
<p>So we may not be out of the woods for this session yet.
<br>
<p>I'll add from a technical standpoint -- using skin punch biopsies
<br>
(the method ACT used) as a source for the transplanted cells
<br>
*is* likely to produce poor results.  Those cells (even fibroblasts
<br>
or epidermal stem cells) are pretty differentiated.  You really want
<br>
circulating stem cells or intestinal crypt (stem-like) cells which
<br>
are presumably less differentiated and more likely to be revertable
<br>
to totipotency.
