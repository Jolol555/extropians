<p>True, and then you are dealing still with NIMBY aesthetics. The typical
<br>
household requires 75-150  kWh per day. Depending on one's latitude,
<br>
local climate, etc. the amount of surface area to supply the typical
<br>
household its power via solar panels ranges from half up to three times
<br>
the surface area of the roof of the home. In most communities, they are
<br>
highly unaesthetic, as are also wind turbines. Such systems run into
<br>
significant problems with neighbor and community approval when
<br>
homeowners submit permit applications to install such systems.
<br>
<p>Solar technology is far too fragile to build into roads and sidewalks.
<br>
They'd be destroyed with the first snowplow.
<br>
<p>Arable land may be a fraction of total land, but it is also several
<br>
times greater than developed land, so the rooftops idea is further
<br>
weakened. Clearcutting wooded mountaintops, or covering over desert
<br>
landscapes also will run into brick walls of environmentalist
<br>
opposition.
<br>
<p>Finally, as I have also said, when you pay more for an efficiency
<br>
measure than it is worth currently on the market compared to other
<br>
alternatives, you are in the end wasting energy (money=energy), far more
<br>
than you 'save' with your 'green' system.
