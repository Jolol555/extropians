<em>&gt; That is a very neat idea Alex. Many in the legal profession might oppose it

</em><br>
<p>I can see a simple hack: introduce the tradition of a single bill,
<br>
containing all the laws that most people think should be &quot;permanent&quot;
<br>
along with various laws that have some minor controversy but which
<br>
their sponsors hope won't merit too much objection, and introduce it
<br>
all as a single chunk.  To weed out the waste would require going
<br>
through it all - an onerous task, especially if it is deliberately
<br>
made obscure.  The legislators get their pet unpopular legislation
<br>
included, so they have no incentive to oppose this scheme.  The entire
<br>
package is introduced with whatever a reasonable sunset period is
<br>
determined to be, and voted on as a block - either take it with the
<br>
waste, or let the entire legal code go away.
<br>
<p>In computer terms, this would be a compiled binary instead of the
<br>
source code.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the worst of the waste, that practically no one supports, could
<br>
get weeded out this way, if there was also established a tradition of
<br>
some appointed (by self or others) legal clerks going through the whole
<br>
body and retyping it up for this block; they would skip those laws that
<br>
they think should not be.  The problem is that copy-and-paste, with no
<br>
one ever reviewing the more obscure laws, makes so much more economic
<br>
sense for preparing this block of law that the temptation to use it
<br>
might be overwhelming.  (&quot;Fight temptation&quot; is not an answer unless you
<br>
have something beyond mere willpower to fight it with...)  I'm not sure
<br>
if copy-and-paste preparation of the laws themselves could be
<br>
effectively outlawed...
