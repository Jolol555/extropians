<p>
Fellow Extropians/Transhumans,
<br>
<p>Like most of the people on this list ( I hope ), I have been watching the 
<br>
exchanges going on in this list with growing disappointment and 
<br>
exasperation.  What started out as an active debate degenerated quickly 
<br>
into what I can only describe as childishness, and what seems in some cases 
<br>
to be genuine dislike, and certainly overt lack of respect.  I've noticed 
<br>
many of the more &quot;well known&quot; names around here have stayed very silent on 
<br>
this debate, and looking back I wish I'd emulated them from the start myself.
<br>
<p>Speaking of myself, I certainly feel a share of the blame.  While I've not 
<br>
sunk to calling people &quot;fool&quot; or &quot;idiot&quot;, I've used my share of sarcasm in 
<br>
this &quot;debate&quot;, and I feel, given my misreading of some aspects of the 
<br>
feeling around here, that it has not shown this list in a good light, and 
<br>
for that I am very sorry.  Given that I can generally judge the mood of 
<br>
people around me, I really should have known better.
<br>
<p>But shouldn't we all have known better?  I think so.  But it's clear to me 
<br>
why many didn't react as though they did.
<br>
<p>They're hurting.  Bigtime.  Still.  Probably forevermore  Given what 
<br>
they've been through, what they've seen, that's not surprising, and they're 
<br>
entitled to it for sure.
<br>
<p>The only real difference here has been how people dealt with it.  Some got 
<br>
angry, very, very angry, and &quot;lashed out&quot; at others.  Sabres and references 
<br>
were rattled.  Some seemed to despair.  Many remained silent, what could be 
<br>
said?  And others, myself included, tried clumsily to inject a little of 
<br>
our own experience into the mix, with &quot;mixed&quot; results.
<br>
<p>The same pain, many different ways of coping with it.  Even if we claim to 
<br>
being Pre, Trans, Post, or Superhuman, we all still got a little of the 
<br>
monkey boy (or girl) in there waiting to bust out, and I think in some ways 
<br>
the zookeeper left the cage door open just a little :)
<br>
<p>Now, it seems to me that Samantha in particular got set upon in the midst 
<br>
of all this.  I hope she didn't take it personally.  I think she spoke well 
<br>
and made relevant points, even in the face of uncharacteristically hostile 
<br>
and unextropian comments, some even addressing her personally.
<br>
<p>No doubt some will tell me this is the nature of the list, to get over it, 
<br>
or not to be such a sissy.  That if I can't take it, then get the hell 
<br>
out.  However, there have been comments about people here, made by people 
<br>
here, that go beyond mere debate.  That go beyond the spirit of this 
<br>
list.  The sorts of namecalling even the most amateur debating societies 
<br>
wouldn't make.  Remarks I just wouldn't make to friends.  Behaviour that 
<br>
saddens me far more than it annoys me.  Said in grief and pain true, but 
<br>
said nonetheless.
<br>
<p>I know that we can and will do better, that we'll leave these events in the 
<br>
past, and take with us the pain, and hopefully some of the lessons,  for as 
<br>
long as we all exist.
<br>
<p>On the Saturday following the tragedy, the day following our national day 
<br>
of mourning, my wife and I went to the U.S. Embassy here in Dublin, 4 days 
<br>
after the world went nuts.  After 4 days worth of human wall had surrounded 
<br>
the building, leaving flowers, cards, or just staring into the compound.  4 
<br>
days after a group of distraught Americans had spontaneously, in despair as 
<br>
much as defiance, burst into the Star Spangled Banner at its' gates.  And 
<br>
we sang too.  And let me tell you, we don't even know the words of our 
<br>
_own_ anthem, even in English.  But we know yours.  We knew it that day.
<br>
<p>We signed the book of condolence.  What else could we do?  In it, I wrote;
<br>
<p>Respect, Remembrance, Restraint.
<br>
<p>I will try practice these 3 things in the name of the victims whose final 
<br>
moments I just can't bring myself to imagine, because it scares and hurts 
<br>
the hell out of me.
<br>
<p>I will try practice these things in the memory of over 6000 people I never 
<br>
knew, and never will.
<br>
<p>Couldn't this list do with a little of all three, here among friends?
<br>
<p><p><p>James...

<em>&gt;Subject: Re: TERRORISM: the grim prospects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Like everybody else Robert J. Bradbury has read some of the charming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quotes of Mr. Bin Laden such as:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Jihad is allowed against infidels like the Jews, Christians and atheists&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot; Our enemy, the target -- if God gives Muslims the opportunity to do so-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is every American male&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies--civilians and military--
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which it is possible to do it&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And like everybody else Robert watched on live TV as this same man
</em><br>
<em>&gt;butchered 6 thousand people in one hour. So with understandable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exasperation he asked Samantha Atkins &quot; Samantha , if you read this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- -- can you possibly interpret the above statement in any way other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than &quot;these people want you dead&quot;?&quot; Samantha dismissed the brutal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;language and charred bodies with a wave of her hand and just said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Quite easily. As I am sure you can also with a moment or two more of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reflection.&quot; She then proceeded with a long dictionary definition quotation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in an attempt to show that when a man says clearly and articulately that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he wants to kill you more than anything else in the whole wide world and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even after he has in fact killed you it is nevertheless not a sign of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hostility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I rather doubt that Robert is really puzzled by this behavior, I suspect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he and most of the members of this list have found the solution but are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too polite to state the obvious. I however think some things need to be said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and will do so now. The world is full of blithering idiots and Samantha 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Atkins
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is one of them.
</em><br>

<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
