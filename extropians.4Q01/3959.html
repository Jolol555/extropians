Perhaps learning to dismiss the majoritarian view, might also help? If you 
<br>
have a more selective opinion of 'group belonging' from the start; perhaps 
<br>
this could enhance adjustment and assuage pain?

<p>&lt;&lt;Rejection by Peers May Lead to Violent Behavior
<br>
<p>By Charnicia E. Huggins NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - For years researchers 
<br>
have debated whether social exclusion and rejection caused aggressiveness or 
<br>
resulted from it. Now new study findings, as well as anecdotal evidence from 
<br>
the recent series of school shootings across America, suggest that social 
<br>
exclusion or rejection may indeed lead to aggressive behavior, as well as 
<br>
violence.``Thus, children who might not have been aggressive otherwise will 
<br>
often become aggressive after they have been rejected by their peers,'' lead 
<br>
study author Dr. Jean M. Twenge of San Diego State University in California 
<br>
told Reuters Health... &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Students who were told that the scores from their personality tests 
<br>
indicated that they would ``end up alone later in life,'' and that their 
<br>
essay was ``one of the worst'' the reader had read, reciprocated by giving 
<br>
their partners an extremely low rating--an average 26 on a scale of 10 to 
<br>
100, the researchers report.``Anticipating a lonely future made people 
<br>
sharply more harsh and aggressive toward someone who had recently criticized 
<br>
them,'' the authors write in the December issue of the Journal of Personality 
<br>
and Social Psychology...&gt;
