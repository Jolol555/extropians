Robots Rising
<br>
Hans Moravec
<br>
<a href="http://frontwheeldrive.com/hans_moravec.html">http://frontwheeldrive.com/hans_moravec.html</a>
<br>
<p>Hans Moravec has been building robots since 1963: his first at age ten. His
<br>
1988 book, Mindchildren began a public access to the ideas of his speculative
<br>
science. His current volume, Robot continues these conjectures of a future
<br>
robot-run world with fervor. Moravec holds that a robot-reign is inevitable
<br>
and that it won't be so bad...
<br>
<p>frontwheeldrive: Your new book offers a rich abundance of evidence that robots
<br>
will surpass us in the next hundred years or so. What would you say to people
<br>
who still don't believe?
<br>
<p>Hans Moravec: Just wait and see! I've promised a next book in 2008, by which
<br>
time the first specialized utility robots should be crawling around many
<br>
homes. If that doesn't convince, them by the time of the following book in
<br>
2018, there should be a first generation of rigidly programmed universal
<br>
robots, and a dawning second generation of ones that learn like Skinner's
<br>
rats. Soon after that, the skeptics will be able to argue their cases with
<br>
wily conversational programs.
<br>
<p>Speaking of which, are you and Roger Penrose friends? Having read The Emporers
<br>
New Mind myself, your constant jabs at him in Robot were hilarious.
<br>
<p>I have great respect for Penrose, having long been interested in his physics
<br>
and mathematical work. We've met a number of times and places in the last
<br>
decade and had nice conversations, and gave joint talks. But boy, did he grab
<br>
the wrong end of the stick in his AI arguments!
<br>
<p>Are you planning to do all you can to help the &quot;Robot Revolution&quot; on?
<br>
<p>I've been interested in the idea that life and intelligence can result from
<br>
properly assembling inanimate matter since at least age four, when my father
<br>
helped me build a &quot;dancing man&quot; using parts from a mechanical construction
<br>
set. Several science fair robots, two graduate degrees for mobile robots and
<br>
twenty additional years of work on making mobile robots practical later, I'm
<br>
engaged in research towards commercial smart industrial transport and cleaning
<br>
machines by 2005, and then even smarter home vacuum cleaners, and all that
<br>
follows! In short, &quot;Yes, in every day, in every way.&quot;
<br>
See here.
<br>
<p>What are you working on currently? Do you have any recent research or goals
<br>
you can share with my readers?
<br>
<p>Our goal is laboratory prototype sensor-based software for utility mobile
<br>
robots for industrial transport, floor maintenance, security etc., that
<br>
matches the months-between-error reliability of existing industrial robots
<br>
without requiring their expensive worksite preparation or site-specific
<br>
programming. Our machines will navigate employing a dense 3D awareness of
<br>
their surroundings, be tolerant of route surprises, and be easily placed by
<br>
ordinary workers in entirely new routes or work areas. The long-elusive
<br>
combination of easy installation and reliability should greatly expand
<br>
cost-effective niches for mobile robots, and make possible a growing market
<br>
that can itself sustain further development.
<br>
<p>What advice would you give aspiring roboticists out there? Aspiring AI
<br>
programmers?
<br>
<p>There are starting to be university programs in robotics, but the field is
<br>
very new and still shaping itself. It will need input from almost everywhere.
<br>
First of all, of course, robots need to be built and given basic programming,
<br>
so computer science and engineering are useful. But as they become more
<br>
common, designers, psychologists, and people knowledgeable in the application
<br>
areas will become more important. After 2010, some expert will have the right
<br>
robot application programs for every task we want robots to do, and pretty
<br>
soon that will cover just about every area of human activity, and beyond!
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
