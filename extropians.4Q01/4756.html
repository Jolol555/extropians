<p>Ben,
<br>
<p>I had some of the same questions about this test that you had.  I've also 
<br>
considered the question of &quot;normal&quot; very seriously for two years, and I've 
<br>
come to the opposite conclusion:  there is a normal, and understanding it 
<br>
is important.  The concept of normal is somewhat like the concept of 
<br>
&quot;alive.&quot;  The many living things have little in common with each other, but 
<br>
they have a bond of sameness also in that they divide cells, eat, and 
<br>
respirate.  Normal people range in personality over a wide spectrum, but 
<br>
there are a few things they have in common that make them, if not normal, 
<br>
NT.  I've found that manic-depressives are most often NT, though no one 
<br>
would want to call them exactly normal.  So refining normal to NT, here are 
<br>
some thoughts on what it is and how to recognize it.
<br>
<p>First, you're right about the shallowness of this test.  I thought it 
<br>
focused too much on externals, and yet depended on the subject's ability to 
<br>
know how he is different from other people.  It also expects a level of 
<br>
generalization, for example, what is a &quot;party&quot;?  I can think of some 
<br>
parties I'd flee, and others I'd pay a lot to attend.  The library makes me 
<br>
tired, and if I don't have a book I need, I'd rather stay home.  The 
<br>
question assumes an ability or willingness to look past these particulars 
<br>
and conjure up a generic &quot;party&quot; at which people stand about with social 
<br>
drinks, laugh a lot, and tell little stories.  I've been to very few of 
<br>
those, how about you?  I have only a dim picture of that sort of 
<br>
thing.  Since I know this is what they are asking for, I'd reply, in 
<br>
default, the library.  But it's not really accurate, because I like to be 
<br>
with people if I can be sure of myself and not fatigued.
<br>
<p>Most of the other questions had similar problems embedded.  I thought that 
<br>
it was portraying a rather simple stereotype of a person on the autistic 
<br>
spectrum, and then asking questions designed to find YES or NO answers 
<br>
about these &quot;typical&quot; traits.  Because its aim was so obvious, it lost 
<br>
value in my eyes.  It is only a bit more insightful than the 
<br>
career-choosing test I got in high school, that had question as obvious as 
<br>
&quot;do you enjoy mixing cement&quot; and &quot;do you like taking care of sick people&quot;?
<br>
<p>But don't be fooled, NT is not an artificial construct.  You are correct 
<br>
when you wonder if raising questions like this means that you are 
<br>
automatically not NT.  I know of some NTs who would question the test 
<br>
itself very sharply, but they would never question the value of 
<br>
&quot;normal.&quot;  They know innately what &quot;normal&quot; is, and they are afraid of its 
<br>
opposite.  Questioning &quot;normal&quot; is done only by autistics, and some parents 
<br>
of autistic children who deal with their discomfort/sadness by claiming 
<br>
that no one is normal.
<br>
<p>A listmember here once said, the essence of being autistic is feeling 
<br>
alone.  To turn that around, the essence of being NT is feeling part of a 
<br>
group.  They feel this, they don't have rules for it.  The rules come about 
<br>
because of what they feel, rather than the other way.
<br>
<p>There are NTs who don't like to go to parties, and there are some who don't 
<br>
follow fashion, or who like to study.  None of these traits is &quot;owned&quot; by 
<br>
autism, which is why stereotypes are only partly useful.  But shy and quiet 
<br>
NTs will still have some one person they feel part-of-a-group with, or they 
<br>
will take quiet enjoyment out of being in a group setting and just feeling 
<br>
it.  If they don't follow fashion, it's for some reason, like lack of 
<br>
money, or being part of a group that does not follow fashion, or just not 
<br>
being interested.  NTs range widely over a personality spectrum.  However, 
<br>
all of them will have an innate sense of how clothing relates to a 
<br>
group.  They will be able to read clothing signals and feel the right to 
<br>
interpret &quot;messages&quot; being sent by apparel.
<br>
<p>My NT sister tells me that NTs have some common traits such as, they don't 
<br>
like direct communication.  They only permit direct corrective 
<br>
communication with those they admit as superiors (father; boss; priest) or 
<br>
else their closest friends, with whom they will exercise the same right in 
<br>
return.  Because of this, they have a set of practices (innately) that 
<br>
communicate indirectly what they won't say directly.  If a person at a 
<br>
party is saying something wrong, no one will correct that person, but they 
<br>
will have different facial expressions, or will walk away, or turn their 
<br>
bodies away.  The NT transgressor is expected to pick this up and alter his 
<br>
own behavior.  Failure to do so is interpreted as intentional offense.
<br>
<p>They use these means so much, that everything comes to seem intentional.  I 
<br>
commented to my NT sister that my husband's personal dress code was out of 
<br>
line, and I wondered what everyone would think.  She said they would think 
<br>
he was trying to change the group dress code.  I was surprised; all I had 
<br>
in mind was that they would think he was ignorant or gauche.  I am reminded 
<br>
of a boy I knew in college who dressed as a Hippie, which I took to be how 
<br>
his family dressed, or something--just his personal choice.  He told me 
<br>
later that he overheard someone commenting that he dressed as a hippie to 
<br>
try to come and change things and make everyone think something or 
<br>
other.  I would never dream of interpreting him with such intentionality; 
<br>
to me, it was his natural tree bark or fur.
<br>
<p>The innate sense of being part of things, of adjusting without being taught 
<br>
rules, and the tendency to interpret non-verbal details as intentional 
<br>
communication, are the essence of being NT.  This is what all the NT 
<br>
personalities have in common, and what even the slightest autistics do not do.
<br>
<p>The test's main flaw in my opinion was to miss this, and to pick it up only 
<br>
in externals that are open to misinterpretation, like the party/library choice.
<br>
<p>My own contention is that autistic traits can be grouped in seven 
<br>
categories:  interpersonal connectedness; perseveration; emotional output; 
<br>
splinter skills; neuro/sensory; motor-skills; language.  Differences in 
<br>
these categories define autism whether it's LFA, AS, or the mildest &quot;geek&quot; 
<br>
syndrome someone wants to detect.  If the supposed &quot;geek&quot; has 
<br>
interconnectedness with other geeks, and gets good grades across the board, 
<br>
and can change the subject easily even in his own mind, then the &quot;geek&quot; is 
<br>
just a &quot;geek.&quot;  On the other hand, my skateboarding son, who does not look 
<br>
or act like a computer nerd, checks out autistic in all of these categories 
<br>
(though he'll argue that he's okay on motor skills now).
<br>
<p>Shallow stereotypes are really not the way to pick this up accurately.
