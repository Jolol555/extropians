<p>
curious:
<br>
<p>art is only healthy way to 'neutralise' frustration born because
<br>
of suffering.
<br>
<p>&quot;it's because of rash statements like that the government doesn't trust 
<br>
scientists&quot;*
<br>
<p>amara:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Did you dance? :-)
</em><br>
<p>not traditional foot scraping, no.  :)  however, i do detect the suffering; 
<br>
but it is not really part of my cortex.  like &quot;oh they have suffered, and 
<br>
here it now comes (back out)&quot;.  it seems that in discussion the suffering 
<br>
element is the primary expressive element in the culture's dances (greek).  
<br>
just one of the ways in which the culture's expressive mechanisms (type: 
<br>
generically: positive, negative, induced, real) are configured.  however, 
<br>
i've experienced in my teen years, in information factory america, positive 
<br>
mechanical dancing at raves (without modifiers**).  a symphony of internal 
<br>
biologic process, real-time sensation, and thoughts / realizations of world 
<br>
mechanics via the dance-media; and happiness with the above three.  so it is 
<br>
very hard for me to &quot;buy new suffering&quot;.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Greeks dance when they are grieving to get their suffering out.
</em><br>
<p>why isn't it sublimated into something else?  i don't understand that 
<br>
specific mechanic.  for how can the suffering be absolved if the dance is 
<br>
self-referencing (to suffering).  that leads me to: is this not coming from 
<br>
the culture?  and at what stimulus interval threshold can the culture 
<br>
/overcome, use, modify/ the material coming from the government?  for 
<br>
instance if the suppressant material is displayed to the average citizen 14 
<br>
times per day (multimode), physiologically can the individual modify the 
<br>
sentiment of what he/she is experiencing?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt;however,what similar elements exist in america, or the non-america?
</em><br>
<p>most of the popular songs say &quot;yes, i concur, i love you, purchase, america, 
<br>
life: examine it for a second, i love you&quot;
<br>
<p>but i dont know if that is as characteristic as rebetika.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I'm most sensitive to music because of my family background, maybe
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I can make some observations of the &quot;suffering elements&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; America: Blues music
</em><br>
<em> &gt;   suffering index: pretty low
</em><br>
<p>america is hard to classify.  the base population cannot absorb blues.  and 
<br>
it was not engineered to be distributed to future citizens in force.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; German
</em><br>
<em> &gt;   suffering index pretty low. Even with Carmina Burana in their history,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I've not found 'suffering elements' yet.
</em><br>
<p>probably because they've primarily generated suffering. (hands over mouth).  
<br>
sufferance generator.  like turkey in this case.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Italian
</em><br>
<em> &gt;   This culture is probably as expressive (or more?) as the Greeks
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (I think that if you tied an Italian's hands behind their back, they
</em><br>
<em> &gt; would not be able to talk), \
</em><br>
<p>or touch and kiss you. :)
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Others?
</em><br>
<p>NONE
<br>
<p><p><p>*joke
<br>
**drugs
