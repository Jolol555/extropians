<p>One should not forget that the German Buzz-bombing of London
<br>
was intended for civilians.  I'd view the British bombing of
<br>
Hamburg as tit-for-tat.  (Whether it was in violation of the
<br>
Geneva convention remains an open question).
<br>
<p>I think I've also read that there were 4 &quot;industrial&quot; cities
<br>
that were potentially targeted for atomic bombs.  Anyone know
<br>
which they were?  We did of course fire bomb Tokyo, but I
<br>
don't think it was damaged to the degree Hamburg was.
<br>
It would seem that using A-bombs on the capitol is the
<br>
best way to end a war -- the problem is you make an enemy
<br>
for a *very* long time.
