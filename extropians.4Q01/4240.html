<em>&gt; &gt; (1) Humor is important, and ridicule can be an effective communication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technique, especially in a medium such as this, where the person with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whom you are directly responding is not the audience of your speech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (2) Probably the majority of what people find &quot;offensive&quot; was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intended to be by the speaker, merely misinterpreted as such by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; listener.  People /are/ often offended by simple honesty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The krap that I was the target of when I expressed unpopular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views on this list (for one)  was most certainly intended to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offensive.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  Again, you seem to be reading more than what I am writing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am really running out of patience for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over-intellectualizing ignoring of the obvious and the refusal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say what sort of communication is and is not acceptable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live by it. 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Intellectualizing&quot; is what I (and others) do.  Philosophy
<br>
matters.  It's also important for us to examine ALL the assumptions
<br>
our culture makes when we are dedicated to overthrowing many of
<br>
them.  Certainly some of that culture is useful, but we do have
<br>
to examine it carefully to determine that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I received and what I have seen others receive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not acceptable to me.  Some of what I myself have said when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have lost my patience with certain individuals is also not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable to me.  I will not be party to it by doing it myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor will I excuse, ignore or condone it when others do it.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds good to me.  The only thing I generally object to is the
<br>
creation of written policies without proper examination.  Personal
<br>
policies, commitments, and judgments are good things: if someone
<br>
wants to killfile me or rebuke me, I won't object.  But written
<br>
policies can have the effect of limiting the scope of discussion,
<br>
and it's important that those not be taken lightly, or based on
<br>
purely cultural assumptions like &quot;civility&quot; without examining
<br>
exactly what their costs and benefits are.
<br>
<p>I agree that politeness has considerable benefits.  I completely
<br>
reject the idea that is has no costs.
