<p>Cultural imperialism isn't necessarily evil. IMHO there are things that
<br>
are always bad, no matter what your culture (for example female
<br>
circumcision) - it always decreases the possibilities for humans to
<br>
strive for happiness. This is of course an unabashedly normative
<br>
statement, which may not be popular in some quarters. But my position is
<br>
that if cultural imperialism helps people live freer lives with more
<br>
opportunities for happiness, yay for imperialism! :-)
<br>
<p>As for Afghanistan, it is going to be a tricky case. But the way of
<br>
dealing with it that has the most likeliehood of actually succeeding and
<br>
not resulting in more undesirable side-effects like another bin laden is
<br>
not to attempt to turn it into New Jersey. Rather, there are many
<br>
remnants of liberal islam and civil society to build on. When Kabul
<br>
television re-started yesterday it was very symbolic that it was a
<br>
teenage girl who was presenter - it was both a symbol of the new order,
<br>
and a reminder of the situation before the chaos (she had apparently
<br>
been a presenter of childrens programs before the taliban threw out
<br>
television). There are many similar strands that can be picked up,
<br>
repaired and re-used to build Afghan society with outside help. That
<br>
help will necessarily be biased and have an agenda, but it doesn't have
<br>
to be coercive or seek to remake society into something it isn't and
<br>
have never been. What is needed is the conditions enabling a bottom-up
<br>
change of society rather than the top-down change. The speed with which
<br>
many people reverted after the taliban shows that top-down changes are
<br>
only skin deep.
