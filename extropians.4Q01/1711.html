<br>
A foundational assumption in economics is that people are rational: they
<br>
choose optimal plans of action given their predictions about future states of
<br>
the world. In games of strategy this means that each player's strategy should
<br>
be optimal given his or her prediction of the opponents' strategies. We
<br>
demonstrate that there is an inherent tension between rationality and
<br>
prediction when players are uncertain about their opponents' payoff functions.
<br>
Specifically, there are games in which it is impossible for perfectly rational
<br>
players to learn to predict the future behavior of their opponents (even
<br>
approximately) no matter what learning rule they use. The reason is that in
<br>
trying to predict the next-period behavior of an opponent, a rational player
<br>
must take an action this period that the opponent can observe. This
<br>
observation may cause the opponent to alter his next-period behavior, thus
<br>
invalidating the first player's prediction. The resulting feedback loop has
<br>
the property that, a positive fraction of the time, the predicted probability
<br>
of some action next period differs substantially from the actual probability
<br>
with which the action is going to occur. We conclude that there are strategic
<br>
situations in which it is impossible in principle for perfectly rational
<br>
agents to learn to predict the future behavior of other perfectly rational
<br>
agents based solely on their observed actions.
