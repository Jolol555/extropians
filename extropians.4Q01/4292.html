Damien Broderick noted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The difference is that the victims' families knew that the Japanese
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government and military were responsible; there was a war on. If those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible had run off to hide in China or Tibet, would those countries
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been bombed in reprisal? Maybe.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very troubling.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Japanese troops were attacked by the Allies on Pacific different Pacific 
<br>
islands that they held, as well as mainland China, and Taipan (Taiwan). Also 
<br>
America did have Pearl Habor to help us along. I believe after yesterday's 
<br>
release of Osama and companies, latest video (unless you believe its Wag the 
<br>
Dog black propaganda?) this confirms dear, Osama's complicity. It certainly 
<br>
appears that Al Qeida, was surely co-mingled with the Taleban.
<br>
<p>Again, when it happens to you,  you will feel different. This is not my 
<br>
attempt at being sarcastic, or condescending; but a statement of human 
<br>
nature. When you get splashed by a Cyclone, one will likely get wet. If 
<br>
Melborne is hit with sarin or tabun, and the fellows flee to Jakarta, and 
<br>
whomever is running that nation-state is unresponsive, you may have to come 
<br>
to a decision.  One may also find the wonderful aggregation that comprises 
<br>
the U.N., to be wanting in a desired response also.
