<em>&gt; Yes, it has to happen sooner rather than later ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-beens are proving themselves unfit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to run the planet, and we POSTHUMANS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to organise politically in order to push
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward our radical futurist agenda.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but I won't dare to call myself post-humans yet (especially not at this primitive level of technology).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As an evolutionist rather than a revolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy I think it is consistent to work within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current democratic political framework and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contend ELECTIONS for political power and as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a platform for spreading our message. Why not?
</em><br>
<p>I don't wish to argue whether a progressive verses revolutionary tactic would work better, but bear in mind that in the past human
<br>
history (and even in the history of evolution) events do happen that have a more revolutionary nature than a progressive one,
<br>
bringing in an era of great change.
<br>
<p>The old system (as any political system in the era of stability) supports the continuation of the current way of living, and thus a
<br>
society modelled on the previous lower rates of change could not easily adapt to new changes. In this way, one should abondon the
<br>
old system and work out a new better one to achieve further progress.
<br>
<p>I compare to a progressive to attempting to upgrade a 286-16Mhz computer to the limits of its technology where it still cannot
<br>
perform adequately, when I can easily purchase a new AMD 1Ghz computer for less than a thousand dollars with much better
<br>
capabilities than that upgraded 286.
<br>
<p><p>Personally, I won't waste my time attempting to convince the masses of the benefits of Extropian lifestyles, because I think we
<br>
would achieve relatively little with this. One would have to content with many irrelevant factors and tasks even if one gets
<br>
elected, and the process by no means permit one to achieve election easily.
<br>
<p>To convince the masses would prove difficult too. We already saw what happened to some farmers planting GM foods or to some doctors
<br>
performing abortions. Apparently, public opinion of a close minded nature has high resilience to change.
<br>
<p>I suggest again (though I know it would probably fall on deaf ears) that we sould concentrate on building a colony and creating the
<br>
technologies to bring Transhuman living into our lives, while placing a lower priority on PR. When we can show others how the actual
<br>
implemention of a Transhuman lifestyle looks like, we do not need so many words to convince others. Rather than thinking of helping
<br>
others, we ought to consider what we ourselves had done and can do, to ensure our success so that at least we ourselves can succeed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I intend to stand for UK parliament in central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; London where I am living, and encourage others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to stand on a POSTHUMAN ticket in their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; localities.
</em><br>
<p>Good luck to you. I hope you will prove me wrong and succeed in convincing enough people to make a difference.
