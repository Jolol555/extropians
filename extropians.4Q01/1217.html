&nbsp;From another list:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have started this message about a dozen times and cannot seem to get the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wording just the way I want it. I suppose it is because every time I start 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I become angry. Angry at a company whose gross incompetence leaves me in awe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think a bit of history is in order first off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am not really sure what prompted me to setup an E-Gold account. I know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it was sometime in early 1999. I did my first in-exchange on 4/30/99. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This might qualify me as an early adopter since the batch number was 4723.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There were two things that impressed me about E-Gold, one was that it is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cash based system. Not credit. It also did not rely on any national 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;currency. You could deposit a gold bar, silver coin or just about anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that constitutes real money. It was a great way to make liquid a hard currency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But something happened. E-Gold split itself into G&amp;SR and Omnipay. G&amp;SR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;became the holder of E-Gold and Omnipay was the company used to fund 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;E-Gold accounts. With this split came what I felt was a greater barrier to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entry for E-Gold and suggested there had to be a better way to do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;About this same time came a new player on the market. A little company 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called paypal was started like most dot com startups. They had an idea for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a payment service and brought it online.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is unfortunate, but the guys starting paypal had zero experience in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;net world. The scam artists caught on quickly. Douglas Jackson spotted the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem right away and contacted paypal to help get the fraud under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control. He writes about this at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.standardtransactions.com/en/douglasjacksononpaypal.htm">http://www.standardtransactions.com/en/douglasjacksononpaypal.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have always felt that paypal has had a good idea. I also believe it can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be profitable if done correctly. Maybe someday that will happen, but it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not going to be paypal doing it. They wont last that long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I felt that payment service such as paypal could be used to fund E-Gold 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accounts. After several discussions with Jim Ray I decided that I need to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prove him wrong. He told me I could not do it. He was partially right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I set up my exchange service the first part of this year. I bought some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gold from a few friends that had gold sitting in their accounts. I started 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with paypal and an ACH service to take online checks. The checks turned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out to be a real bad idea. The company I used did zero verification even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though I was paying for that service. So that left me with paypal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My theory was that if I validated customers properly I would not run into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fraud problems with paypal. I also felt I could automate the whole process 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make funding clean and simple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was able to automate the process. I could take a paypal order online and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transfer E-Gold funds into an account with total automation. Problem is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that paypal really sucks at validating accounts. I cut my automation to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only marking orders as paid, but I have to click a button to actually do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the funding. Any more than this was too risky. Paypal was hit with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;famous paypal clone site. The last thing I needed was to become the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laundering tool for this scammer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now I had one more hurdle. I had to verify each and every customer. I did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this by requiring them to give a phone number with the order. Paypal will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not provide me with a contact phone number as part of an order. A big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gaping hole in security on their part. I would check the phone number 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against the address on file with paypal using a reverse directory service. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If they matched I would call to confirm the order. I caught several fraud 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attempts with this alone. If the number was unlisted the user would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required to provide a utility bill showing their name and address. Most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identity theft crooks don't have this available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This was a great concept, but I still failed to miss one type of scammer. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The one that is who they say they are, but reverses charges because they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lost money. The first chargeback I received on my paypal account was just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such a person. He bought E-Gold, dumped it in a ponzi and lost it. His 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solution was to reverse the charges done with paypal. Paypal of course hit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me with those charges.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With a chargeback on my account paypal notified me after the fact that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was now subject to a rolling reserve and would have to pay almost 4% per 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transaction in fees. The rolling reserve was 10% of my last 30 days gross 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revenue. This alone nearly shut me down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;During this time I would try to contact paypal and have funds reversed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when I found a bogus account. I could have stopped more fraud than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entire fraud department at paypal. What I mean by could have is that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never shut down any of the accounts I found as fraudulent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I tried working with them to get a system in place where I would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protected. After all they have a seller protection plan that is supposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to protect me from fraud. (right).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I changed my service to require a pre-verification before an order could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be placed. I setup my existing paypal account to only accept orders from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;verified account holders and had a verification request form on my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;website. When I received a request I would send out a signature form that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had to be faxed or mailed back to me. I setup a new paypal account to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;handle only those customers. This new procedure resulted in a ZERO 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chargeback rate. This meant I could offer a lower rate to my customers. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This was all setup after conversations with the head of business 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development at paypal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Last week I received a note from paypal that my account had been frozen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pending a fraud investigation. I called and finally spoke with the head of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the fraud division. He did not like that I had 2 accounts setup. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;informed him that the second account was under my wife's name, her bank 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;account, her credit card etc... Since she is also listed on the business 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;license that everything was perfectly legitimate and explained to him why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it had been done and who I was working with at paypal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He did not care, he said he has ultimate control over accounts and he did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not want anyone using paypal who was dealing with E-Gold. I tried 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explaining once again about the ZERO chargeback rate on my account, but he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did not care. He wanted my account closed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So as of now I have notified all of my customers that paypal is no longer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an option. You see Jim was partially right. Working with paypal was a bad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idea, but if paypal had a clue it would not be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have started receiving feedback from customers who received the notice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this morning. It is interesting how many horror stories they have to tell. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am going to be devoting more space on my website to this issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe that now paypal is in it's death throws. I have received 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;numerous notes from businesses that it has shut down because of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perceived risk. It does not matter if there is any, but I think it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posturing for shareholders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the year 2000 according to paypals own numbers they lost $169,506,000 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on revenues of $14,460,000. They don't tell us how much of that was due to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fraud. I am sure it was a considerable portion. They are now trying to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an IPO. The underwriters have valued the offering at $80,500,000. That is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not even enough money to cover operating losses. I think by making the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appearance that they are getting tough on fraud they think they can get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more funding. I have news for them, they are looking in the wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direction. They are the ones committing fraud. Especially since they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to hold my money for 6 months before returning it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thank you for reading this long tirade.
