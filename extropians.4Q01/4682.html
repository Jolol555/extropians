<p>As much as I think you're right, that's sad.  Memento was one of
<br>
the worst movies I'd seen this year.  On the DVD there was a short
<br>
written piece which I guess the movie was based off of, which was
<br>
SO much better than the movie itself.  Great idea, horribly executed.
<br>
So horribly so, that I was really disappointed.

<p><em>&gt; With his memories constantly being erased,
</em><br>
<p>His in-brain memories, perhaps.  But, he still has external memories,
<br>
those he captures in a persistent way.  So, to some degree, he still
<br>
has memories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is there any point to staying alive?
</em><br>
<p>He still has a goal.
<br>
<p>I have a difficult time remembering things from my past, even as
<br>
recently as a week ago.  Is there any point to my staying alive?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you were in Leonard's situation, would you try to live, to improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your life?  Or might one just as well give up?
</em><br>
<p>I'd stay alive for a few reasons:
<br>
<p>1)  There may be a cure or a repair that would restore my ability
<br>
to form long-term memories sometime within my lifetime.
<br>
<p>2)  My long-term memories (formed since the injury) may not truly 
<br>
be lost, but just inaccessible.  Some day, I may be able to access
<br>
those long-term memories again.
<br>
<p>3)  I still have all the physical effects in the world that can
<br>
effectively replace my own natural long-term memory, at least to
<br>
the point where I can continue to function day-to-day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like Leonard, our life will be a series of time-bounded moments, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuity and causality linking them, but no sense of common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity.
</em><br>
<p>You say this as though we ALL don't live our lives like Leonard
<br>
to some degree.  I wonder ...
<br>
<p>Just because you have natural long-term memory and that you perceive
<br>
a sense of continuity and we want to believe that there's causality,
<br>
how seriously convinced are you of it?  Enough to feel that you're
<br>
functioning as &quot;normal&quot;?  Take out long-term memory ... what would
<br>
it take to still have a sense of continuity and sufficiently provide
<br>
evidence of causality?  Would external cues be sufficient?  Perhaps ...
