<p>Actually, before the arrival of the Conquistadors, Native North American
<br>
societies (not including Aztecans and points south) were rather
<br>
peaceful, with inter-tribal warfare limited to ritualistic
<br>
confrontations for 'counting coup' similar to the jousting typical of
<br>
northern europe in medeival times.
<br>
<p>### I am not quite convinced about it. The recent discovery of physical
<br>
evidence of canibalism in North American Indians would make me wary of
<br>
trying to emulate their way of life.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>Furthermore, as a historical counterexample, take medieval Iceland. The
<br>
sagas recount a really idyllic society with no government, merely an
<br>
informal priestly cast of 'umpires', where free trade was the norm and
<br>
the only coersion was that individuals honor their contracts. Nor was
<br>
this society isolated from the rest of the world, for the Vatican had
<br>
repeatedly sent a Bishop and missonaries to the island, and trade in
<br>
live animals (arctic falcons, etc) originating in Iceland spread as far
<br>
as Mecca and Istanbul.
<br>
<p>### The Althing was an embryonic form of government. Can we trust the sagas
<br>
to accurately describe the amount of violence? And as soon as the population
<br>
density goes up, the idyll is over.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### How many thousands of years did take to invent the wheel (counting
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A government (usually a bad one) will form well before industry, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without stability offered by a good government, hardly any research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will take place.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, outside of agricultural trade in grain, olive oil,
<br>
wine, and many other goods, mining was the first heavy industry, traces
<br>
of which can be dated back as far as 5000 BC with simple metals like
<br>
gold, tin, silver and copper, while flint and obsidian mines have
<br>
operated for thousands of years into the Ice Age, trading their goods
<br>
over thousands of miles.
<br>
<p>### But were they &quot;ungoverned&quot;? The village chieftain and his cabal can be
<br>
quite tough on the underdog.
<br>
<p>----------
<br>
<p>Government is only created when some portion of the population
<br>
encounters conditions of scarcity in the local area. Humans had been
<br>
innovating and industrializing long before this became necessary.
<br>
<p>### Yes, you are right here. But on the other hand, isn't population
<br>
pressure, population density and competition potent forces for innovation
<br>
and industialization? Can you have a development from an agrarian society
<br>
into a high-tech one, without a government developing along the way?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Coercion always comes first - government comes later. This played
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out in hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies hundreds of times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (again, Native Americans, Polynesians......)
</em><br>
<p>Coersion IS government. What part of the word &quot;en-force&quot; don't you
<br>
understand?
<br>
<p>### No. Government is a an institution, usually geographically defined,
<br>
claiming the monopoly for the use of force, usually in an area. You can have
<br>
force without the monopoly and government, and be that much worse for wear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<p>Unless their land is taken by force, landless individuals living in land
<br>
monopolies have only themselves to blame for selling out in the past.
<br>
<p>### How about their equally landless children? Should they be blamed too?
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and other contractual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreements to ward off mergers and the like.  (Sometimes, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient to do so, but beforehand, we can't always be sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntary behavior is inefficient or that coerced behavior can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Who is going to ward off mergers??? Why? How?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We agreed there is no coercion allowed in this experiment, so you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to be pretty smart, trying to stop landowners from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consolidating their holdings by marriage.
</em><br>
<p>The inaccurate assumption is that a merger of two firms will result in a
<br>
merger of two market shares.
<br>
<p>### Explain?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two, land will go up in value if some want to buy more and more of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The price will rise, meaning that owners of it will make more money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no way to tell how much, but this already shows how your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario is a bit unrealistic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### You are forgetting that the large landowners make more money than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the small ones, both gross, and sometimes even per acre (they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afford the expensive, imported machines). The less land available for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sale there is, the more difficult it is for the small operators to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; join the game.
</em><br>
<p>Yet in your scenario, there are heaps of landless peasants available.
<br>
Machinery only does labor in place of man. If machinery is too
<br>
expensive, then human labor becomes competetive, and small operators are
<br>
also therefore competetive.
<br>
<p>### Why do most farms tend to consolidate - as in the US now, no matter if
<br>
there are machines or not? Small means weak in the farming business.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<p>This is inaccurate. Rags to riches to rags in three generations is a
<br>
phenomenon reported in such places as medieval Vietnam (up to the
<br>
present day, even), India, and many other cultures.
<br>
<p>### In feudal societies this is not the way things are.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>Actually, the rags to rags phenomenon will occur faster, on average,
<br>
when primogeniture is NOT prevalent. Think about it: the more a fortune
<br>
is divided with each generation, the quicker a large fortune for one
<br>
person dissolves into merely a fortunate but small windfall for many,
<br>
which is quickly consumed in many cases.
<br>
<p>### I am sorry - I quoted clumsily, making my statement equivocal. I meant
<br>
to say exactly what you pointed out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----
</em><br>
&nbsp;Marginal land sometimes
<br>
<em>&gt; offers a refuge for subsistence farmers, but with enough pressure even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they might end up being displaced.
</em><br>
<p>But you just argued about there being a market balance. If there is a
<br>
balance, then displacement pressure will not occur.
<br>
<p>### In Poland partial displacement occurred as a result of the division of
<br>
peasant-owned land due to population growth (making each of the son's
<br>
existence more precarious and liable to be forced to sell land to large
<br>
landowners).

<br>
<p><p>From: Smigrodzki, Rafal
<br>
&lt;&lt;BTW, can you give valid historical evidence of the beneficial effects of
<br>
the
<br>
absence of a government on social development (I mean *total* absence of a
<br>
government resulting in great improvements in quality and quantity of human
<br>
life)?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Of course there is no such evidence. Nor is there evidence of the beneficial
<br>
effects of the *total* absence of disease, because disease is always present
<br>
in some form. Likewise, government is always present in some form. But we
<br>
can
<br>
still try to get rid of it.
<br>
<p>### The analogy is imperfect.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Disease&quot; is *defined* as a malfunction, something unwished-for, therefore
<br>
its absence, be it partial or (hypothetically), total, is by definition
<br>
beneficial.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;A government is defined functionally, without direct reference to its
<br>
beneficence, therefore its ethical value has to be established
<br>
independently, also regarding the consequences of its total absence. 
<br>
<p>It is incorrect to claim that the government is always present in some form.
<br>
&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; explores one case of its total absence, with deplorable
<br>
results.
