Robert Bradbury:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we do not understand the trends and underlying motivations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that are producing this situation then we will fail to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adequately prepare for and respond to it.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. However, I think that article portrays an extremely skewed or
<br>
wrong set of &quot;facts&quot;, and I disagree that the &quot;facts&quot; in the article
<br>
are &quot;trends&quot;. I question the author's motivations in writing that
<br>
article, and I object to the author's inflammatory writing style. I
<br>
question the newspaper's integrity for printing that article. I also
<br>
am bothered that the article was sent to this list.
<br>
<p>You asked some specific questions regarding what I didn't agree about
<br>
it. I wish to start with a large picture, and then work to specifics
<br>
to answer you. I'll have more specific things to add next week, too,
<br>
regarding the &quot;facts&quot; in the article.
<br>
<p>I've seen some number of articles pointed to on this list about
<br>
extremist Muslims (not always stated that they are &quot;extremist&quot;,
<br>
however). I'm bothered by the imbalance.
<br>
<p>Millions of people in the world are Muslims. Even if one allows that
<br>
some of those people entered that religion under societal or family
<br>
pressures, I think that one can assume that a majority of those Muslims
<br>
entered Islam voluntarily and are gaining some value from their
<br>
religion. Therefore, if so many people are finding value and support
<br>
and meaning from their religious world, I would like to see a balance
<br>
of articles about the positive aspects that their worldview brings to
<br>
them. I've not seen those in the articles sent to this list, but only
<br>
articles about extremist forms of Islam. Did the newspaper not print
<br>
them? If not, then that's an interesting tidbit. Why did it not
<br>
consider it &quot;sell-worthy news&quot; to print something about the daily
<br>
(boring but positive?) life of a Muslim? Did you not see them?
<br>
<p>If I thought that the anthropology article was worthwhile to send to
<br>
the list, then I would have spent an equal amount of time to find an
<br>
article to see another side, to present another view, especially in
<br>
the world situation today. Why? I don't wish to 'feed the monster'.
<br>
The 'monster' is what I call the collection of human violence, fears,
<br>
anxieties, hatreds, suspicions, that emerged full-force on Sept. 11.
<br>
This collection was always present before, but it emerged in a new
<br>
form in September and changed the world. I think that humanity is in a
<br>
very dangerous position now, and alot of extra care and attention is
<br>
needed to diffuse it, to go into it fully open to look at all sides,
<br>
and not amplify the fears to a WWIII.
<br>
<p>The article was printed in a western newspaper, written by someone who
<br>
appears to me to not be  Muslim. It seemed to me to not have an Muslim
<br>
culture origin, while, at the same time, presenting a view the of the
<br>
Muslim culture. That alone alerted me to a large bias. In order to
<br>
learn about another culture, one can : read about it from (many)
<br>
different sources, and/or talk to people from that other culture,
<br>
and/or spend some time living there. I wonder to what extent (if any)
<br>
the author of that anthropology article made these efforts. The bias
<br>
of the article was so strong, that it struck me like much of the
<br>
Soviet propaganda that I read about the U.S. in the 1980s, when I
<br>
visited the Baltics for the first time.
<br>
<p>In addition to the bias of the article's orgin, I found the article's
<br>
tone inflammatory. The author used words like this, while describing
<br>
bin Laden's followers: &quot;miserable band of worshippers responsible&quot;,
<br>
&quot;their often sorry existences&quot;, &quot;uniting the energies of political
<br>
ardour and sex in a turbulent fuel&quot;, (which I think only incites the
<br>
reader.. and this is a 'scientific analysis'?), and then the author
<br>
smoothly moves to describing the rest of the Muslim culture: &quot;their
<br>
comfort in an all-male world begins with the high sex segregation of
<br>
many of the Muslim communities from which the terrorists draw&quot;. Here,
<br>
the author stepped over the line, in my opinion. &quot;High sex segregation&quot;
<br>
in &quot;many of the Muslim ommunities from which the terrorists draw&quot; is
<br>
not true, yet it's used as the scientific basis to present the
<br>
author's 'scientific' anthropological explanation.
<br>
<p>I think that the U.S. needs to respond strongly to the Sept 11 events,
<br>
and I feel a lot of sorrow for the victims of that violence and
<br>
resulting anxieties and fear. However, I hope that humans will evolve
<br>
above that 'monster' and learn some important things. Personally, I'm
<br>
interested in learning the truth about about bin Laden's motivations,
<br>
about the different government's foreign policies these last few
<br>
decades, and about the Muslim culture. And I know well that the truth
<br>
is not something that we can find out by direct means- it will require
<br>
a large effort to be aware of and understand the different
<br>
perspectives.
<br>
<p>I saw a kind of analogy to the 'different perspectives reguired' this
<br>
evening, while travelling home from Noordwijk, Netherlands. My travel
<br>
home was a 7 hour train ride, in which the interior of one of my
<br>
trains was built with plastic smokey-gray partitions and shelves,
<br>
which transmitted and reflected the late evening light through the
<br>
windows in an interesting way. Even though the train seats in front of
<br>
me blocked my view of the passengers, I could see diffused images of
<br>
the train passengers reflected and transmitted all the way up the
<br>
train aisle. In other words, I could see images of different views of
<br>
each of the passengers while looking up at the overhead smokey-gray
<br>
luggage shelves, while looking along the aisle at the vertical
<br>
partitions, and while looking at a glancing angle at the windows. For
<br>
me, learning the 'truth' in our current world situation is a little like
<br>
combining the layered, diffuse, complex, reflected, and transmitted
<br>
images of the train passengers to derive a full picture.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S.  I'm in the middle of some conversations with my next-door
<br>
neighbor, who comes from an Egyptian Muslim world. It's one data point
<br>
only, but I trust this data point alot more than that anthropology
<br>
newspaper article. I'll have some more things to say about the
<br>
article next week.
