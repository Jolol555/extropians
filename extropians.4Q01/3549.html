<em>&gt; As an American friend of mine whose parents came here from Palestine

</em><br>
<em>&gt; After fifty years of eating shit, though, they'd just settle for having

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead, Israel refuses to give up more than a token amount of the land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they took.  They're importing &quot;Jewish&quot; citizens by the thousands,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; eternal turf battles to me.
</em><br>
<p>This is entirely false. Israel has vacated almost 90% of Palestine
<br>
already, hardly a  'token amount'. Construction of new settlements has
<br>
stopped, and expansion of existing ones for 'normal growth' is a subject
<br>
open to debate. A homeowner shouldn't have to be subject to terrorist
<br>
attack just because he wants to build a dormer wing on his house for his
<br>
kids. Doing so is worse than having your use of your private property
<br>
dictated by zoning boards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, this is more than just about Israel.  This is also about continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US support for puppet regimes like in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</em><br>
<p>I don't seem to recall any time when the US has ever given foreign aid
<br>
money to either country.
<br>
<p>Or is it that you think that Saddam Hussein has the best interests of
<br>
the Saudi people in mind?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, the US talks a good game about democracy and freedom, but Middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Easterners who would wish to have freedom and democracy in their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries have to not only battle their own governments, but also the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars and military of the United States.
</em><br>
<p>Once again: specify any time when the US has given military or
<br>
humanitarian aid to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. Everything we've ever sent
<br>
there has been bought and paid for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Cold War is over.  This support of the &quot;lesser of evils&quot; no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes the sense that it did a couple of decades ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd rather see us withdraw from the Middle East completely than continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be embarrassed about our policies there.
</em><br>
<p>You do that and you'll have europe and the US under constant jihad from
<br>
a resurgent muslim empire within a generation. You are worried about
<br>
more terrorism when you should be worried about WWIII.
