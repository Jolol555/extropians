<br>
<p>It's easy to mistake Samantha for the same ilk of radical leftie
<br>
nihilist that 'liberates' lab mice and claims mathematics is a social
<br>
construct (of priviledged white males).
<br>
<p>She is NOT.
<br>
<p>She may echo a lot of that rhetoric when you get her going on issues
<br>
of economic equity and geopolitics, which have been hard to avoid
<br>
lately. But, there are important distinctions between her and the
<br>
leftilists that plague public radio and our nation's campuses:
<br>
<p>1. She is a technologically savvy person, a programmer if I recall
<br>
correctly, and puts forth solid ideas in areas where there is no
<br>
political taint. In contrast, leftilists hate and fear science because
<br>
it is predicated on rationality and dares to propose that some
<br>
phenomena are rooted in nature rather than a vast conspiracy foisted
<br>
upon us by those damn rich white males.
<br>
<p>2. She actually supports individual liberty and technological
<br>
progress! She just believes that the best way to achieve these is
<br>
through measures that those at the other extreme of the creaky old
<br>
left-right spectrum view as socialist. In contrast, the true
<br>
leftilists only want freedom for people to practice the one true
<br>
leftilist faith, and that necessitates an all-controlling collectivist
<br>
state. Since leftilists have a simplistic, us-vs-them view of power
<br>
dynamics, and they know that *they* certainly haven't created anything
<br>
of note, they view innovations with hostility and suspicion-- as
<br>
attempts by the rich white male elite to grab even more power.
<br>
<p>So, I differ with Samantha on a number of issues. She is an Extropian
<br>
who disagrees with me, and those are the ones who really help me
<br>
develop my ideas. Where she is right, I hope to become right. Where
<br>
she is wrong I get to develop my persuasive skills. Where she is wrong
<br>
and doesn't budge, I get to study the psychology of stubbornness. I
<br>
hope you feel the same way, Samantha, are don't misconstrue this as a
<br>
slight. Some of the other things I've seen said to you are hard not
<br>
to interpret that way, but I do think they were made in the heat of
<br>
the moment rather than as calculated insults.
<br>

<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
