</em><br>
<p>To those who posted me offlist regarding the newtonmas story,
<br>
thank you very much, you are too kind.
<br>
<p>As perhaps the only extropian with formal theological training,
<br>
I shall deem myself qualified to present a short lesson in the
<br>
history of religion.  For those who are offended by such
<br>
things, I request forgiveness in advance.
<br>
<p>Asking forgiveness in advance of actually committing the
<br>
sin has historical precedent.  Back in the 15 century, the
<br>
christian church decided to raise money by selling indulgences,
<br>
that is, if the sinner should pay a certain amount they
<br>
could purchase a certificate of forgiveness, signed by the
<br>
Big Guy Himself, (the pope).  It was a kind of 15th century
<br>
version of the modern slay-an-infidel-in-exchange-for-72-
<br>
houris caper.
<br>
<p>Near the end of a particularly successful day of sales,
<br>
the indulgence-selling priests were approached by three
<br>
men who wished to purchase forgiveness for a sin they
<br>
had not yet committed.  They explained that they wished
<br>
to rob a well-armed enemy, and wished to purchase
<br>
forgiveness in advance, for they might perish in the attempt.
<br>
The priests discussed the unusual request, decided it
<br>
made perfect sense, and sold the permission to commit
<br>
armed robbery.
<br>
<p>The priests packed up their money box and headed
<br>
back to their parish, but were soon accosted by the
<br>
three men to whom they had just sold and indulgences,
<br>
brandishing weapons and demanding the loot.  Weighed
<br>
heavily with the chest filled with gold, the reprehensible
<br>
thieves (the bandits that is, not the priests) did not get far.
<br>
The local authorities soon apprehended them, and they
<br>
were hauled before the local magistrate, who demanded
<br>
one good reason why they should not be immediately
<br>
slain.  They produced the pardon, signed by His Holiness
<br>
himself.  They were released.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this historical precedent, I ask permission to commit
</em><br>
blasphemy, and be forgiven, before I even make up the
<br>
particular impiety.  Your indulgence in this matter is
<br>
greatly appreciated.  spike
