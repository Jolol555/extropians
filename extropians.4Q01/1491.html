ObExtro: ants are a great example of spontaneous orders and multiagent
<br>
systems. If we can learn how they do what they do, we can build
<br>
efficient microrobot and nanodevice swarms for many purposes. Besides,
<br>
we are likely to have ants around for a long time in our ecosystems, and
<br>
they might be a cheap way of doing micromanagement.

<p>Sounds good. I have always wanted an ant regulation kit.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure how they detect the pheromones, but there are several
<br>
research groups studying ant pheromones that might have good ideas or
<br>
techniques. C.f. <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/research/bfl/research/vargo.html">http://www.utexas.edu/research/bfl/research/vargo.html</a>
<br>
<p>Here is one abstract I found:

<p>Putative Alarm Pheromones of the Ant Species Formica obscuripes
<br>
(Hymenoptera, Formicidae) 
<br>
Warren J. Wood 
<br>
<p>Alarm pheromones of the ant species Formica obscuripes were
<br>
investigated.  Volatile compounds in the headspace above aggravated
<br>
worker ants were collected by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and
<br>
analyzed using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).  Analysis
<br>
revealed the presence of the suspected alarm pheromones decane,
<br>
undecane, tridecane, 4-tridecene, pentadecane, and heptadecane, as well
<br>
as several unidentified components.  The identities of the
<br>
straight-chain hydrocarbons were confirmed by comparison with mass
<br>
spectra of authentic samples.  The location of the double bond in
<br>
4-tridecene was determined by a standard methylthiolation derivatization
<br>
technique
<br>
<p>Seems to be simple chromatography.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I need to create an instrument which would recognize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between a zero-flux ant-line and a true one way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; migration like the one I saw yesterday.  Wouldnt that work?
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a somewhat tricky problem - not that I think computer vision
<br>
isn't up to it, but it would need training data.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I even had an inspiration on how to recover some of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical.  When I watched the migration I noticed that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward antflux was about 10/second, and the reverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had about 1/second or perhaps 0.5/second.  So what were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the backwards goers doing?  I figure they must be &quot;repeaters&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gals going back along the line replenishing the scent trail which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would otherwise evaporate.  Does that sound right?  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would walk backwards along the trail, excreting a new line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of come-this-way-juice.  What else would they be doing?
</em><br>
<p>The documentary I watched demonstrated the same thing among army ants,
<br>
where the repeaters did rush back to show others the way. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So when I find a migration, I need to capture the backwards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walkers and find out what they are excreting.  Right?  spike
</em><br>
<p>Suck air above them, gather into a chromatograph sample and analyse. But
<br>
don't disturb them, or you get the alarm pheromone instead.
