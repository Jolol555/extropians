From: Greg Burch &lt;<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20&quot;A%20Call%20to%20the%20Muslims%20of%20the%20World&quot;&In-Reply-To=&lt;F167KtWfN3vSAMfKQu100012086@hotmail.com&gt;">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... I've run out of time this morning, but I leave to further &gt;discussion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the question of how prevalant the more militant and &gt;totalitarian forms of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Islamism may be.  My &quot;gut guess&quot; is that there &gt;is something like 10-20% of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Islamic world that have become utterly &gt;radicalized, a population of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some 100-200 million people.
</em><br>
<p>I think the main troubling thing about Islam, of whatever stripe, is the 
<br>
clear rejection of the separation of church and state.  Just about every 
<br>
Muslim will tell you that Islam does not distinguish between private and 
<br>
public life.  It is indisputably the goal of Islam for the whole of society 
<br>
to function according to the teachings of Muhammad.
<br>
<p>I also believe that *all* Muslims will agree that they are enjoined to fight 
<br>
with whatever means they have at their disposal to throw off any attempts to 
<br>
hinder the practice of their religion.  I think the only point about which 
<br>
you and I, Greg, may disagree is the extent to which Islam allows conversion 
<br>
of mere unbelievers by force.  You seem to have concluded that Islam 
<br>
enjoins, or at least permits, conversion of &quot;infidels&quot; at the edge of the 
<br>
sword.  My inquiry has led me to believe that, among all but the most 
<br>
radical sects, focible conversion is not sanctioned by Islamic canon.
<br>
<p>The difficulty though is that, in a religion which has as an explicit goal 
<br>
the running of the whole of society according to religious canon, it is 
<br>
difficult to draw the line between mere &quot;infidels&quot; and religious 
<br>
&quot;persecutors.&quot;  If we are members of the same society and your religion 
<br>
compels you to work toward making our government an Islamic theocracy, any 
<br>
attempt by me to foster a secular government are directly opposed to your 
<br>
expression of your religious impulses.  If I am an Egyptian who is in favor 
<br>
of a secular democratic government, am I merely an &quot;infidel&quot; or am I in fact 
<br>
&quot;persecuting&quot; my fellow citizens whose religion compels them to try to bring 
<br>
about a &quot;truly Islamic&quot; society?  If I am &quot;persecuting&quot; then, clearly, 
<br>
Islamic doctrine authorized jihad.
<br>
<p>So I think the main problem is the difficulty of drawing the line between 
<br>
persecution and mere unbelief.
<br>
<p>-Zero
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm a seeker too. But my dreams aren't like yours. I can't help thinking 
<br>
that somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. 
<br>
Has to be.&quot; -- George Taylor _Planet of the Apes_ (1968)
