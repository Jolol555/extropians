<p>Well, there is a difference between regulated and unregulated
<br>
immigration. Regulated immigration is supposed to place a filter to
<br>
allow in only the sort of people we want here. Our system is set up so
<br>
that it is SUPPOSED to act as a regulated immigration system. The
<br>
problem is, that it doesn't. There are estimated to be between 9 and 30
<br>
million illegal immigrants in the US, most of whome never jumped a fence
<br>
or swam a border river in the wilderness. Most of them came in with
<br>
perfectly legal visas for tourism, education, or employment, and decided
<br>
to stay when their visas ran out, moved from their declared place of
<br>
residence without notification, and we've completely dismantled all
<br>
legal mechanisms that were put into place to keep track of foreign
<br>
visitors to prevent this sort of thing.
<br>
<p>There are 24 countries which are visa exempt with the US, and anyone
<br>
from any other country only has to obtain or forge a passport from one
<br>
of those countries to get into the US without ANY regulation whatsoever.
<br>
<p>We are now in the process of making it illegal for police to demand the
<br>
ID of a person simply because they don't look like a 'normal' American.
<br>
If they look like a 'foreigner' and are stopped by police on that basis,
<br>
they are a victim of 'profiling', which is allegedly 'wrong'. With this,
<br>
there will be absolutely NO way for the US to control who is in our
<br>
country. With a war underway, this is tantamount to refusing to post any
<br>
sentries along the entire battlefront, and refusing to check the
<br>
identity of others on your side of the war zone. This is a pathetically
<br>
incompetent tactic, and is designed to leave us open to further attack
<br>
and sabotage from within. It is meant to further raze the last remaining
<br>
shreds of trust in our allegedly free society.
