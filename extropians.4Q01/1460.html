Crap, garbage and useless information...
<br>
<p>*WHY* isn't there an &quot;author&quot; for the post?
<br>
<p>What the article fails to point out is:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Biological Defense products and services offered by Alexeter Technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are only available for sale to certified hazardous material specialists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced private security agencies and qualified Federal, state and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; municipal laboratories and research facilities. No sales will be made to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the general public.  
</em><br>
<p>I think that probably makes the information useless for most of the
<br>
ExI list readership.
<br>
<p>As their FAQ points out:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTA Test Strips are a type of analytical test known as an &quot;immunoassay&quot;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In order to claim 100% accuracy, it would be necessary to test every known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substance for cross-reactivity.  Since this is impossible as a practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, percent accuracy is determined from statistical calculations based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon the number of substances actually tested.  No antibody-based test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anywhere can ever be claimed as 100% accurate! 
</em><br>
<p>Can you say &quot;false-positives&quot;?
<br>
<p>And then of course:
<br>
<em>&gt; BTA(TM) Test Strip 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simple, easy-to-use test strip system for rapid, on-site analysis of unknown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological samples... specific test for Anthrax (no cross-reaction to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bacteria) - CURRENTLY BACKORDERED 
</em><br>
<p>So you can't buy the reagents even if you can own the test instrument.
<br>
<p>(Source: <a href="http://www.alexeter.com/products.htm">http://www.alexeter.com/products.htm</a>)
<br>
<p>Back to the Economics article:
<br>
<em>&gt; The other is to amplify and identify its DNA.  [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the second is a sophisticated technique that few laboratories are yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to manage. So, even if the result is negative, chaos may already have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been caused and the act of terrorism rewarded. 
</em><br>
<p>Caca...  More chaos is generated by the false positives.  Any laboratory
<br>
equipped to do PCR (which is all major universities, most large microbiology
<br>
laboratories, e.g. hospitals, as well as police crime labs) could manage
<br>
to identify Anthrax DNA in a sample in 4-6 hours (*if* they were told how
<br>
to do it).  Most of the major universities have people who could go through
<br>
the databases, figure out which primers are needed for the PCR and write
<br>
up a protocol.
