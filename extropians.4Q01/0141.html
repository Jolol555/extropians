&lt;The problem is that, in military tradition, seeking to die in battle is
<br>
generally foolish and cowardly. The 'heroes' who die with little
<br>
military gain but a battle cry are a waste of resources that could be
<br>
spent training someone who uses themselves in ways to benefit victory.
<br>
If such lived instead, they would generally be court martialed for the
<br>
stupid acts that kill them.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking to die in battle *for no effect* is generally foolish.
<br>
It's not cowardly however.  If I storm the bayonet line holding
<br>
the regiment's colors and die on the spot from massed fire to
<br>
my person, and thus my fellows' stage an attack to retrieve the
<br>
colors of the unit (overcoming their cowardice)...and I hoped
<br>
this would happen when I staged the one man charge...was I
<br>
a coward?  What if I attempt to goad the enemy into responding
<br>
in a way that my general needs them too?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't this much like what happened on 9-11?
<br>
<p>&lt;Furthermore, it is indeed cowardly to shoot or otherwise kill unarmed
<br>
civilians. Dying in the act of doing so is doubly cowardly, since one
<br>
thereby avoids facing the consequences of their actions (i.e. the war
<br>
crimes trials).&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuff and nonsense. It's not &quot;cowardly&quot;. It's certainly *dishonourable*,
<br>
and possibly foolish. You have to remember war is ultimately a game
<br>
with no rules.. and the terrorist organizations EXPLICITELY stated
<br>
what rules they were playing under.  It's our misfortune to have become
<br>
entagled in tribalist politics in their home region and thus engendered
<br>
their
<br>
ire.  And war crimes trials are as despicable a concept as has ever
<br>
been invented. Substitute &quot;trial by victor&quot;... half of Europe's civilization
<br>
arose from the notion of chivalry...that you didn't just casually off
<br>
people you just beat on a battlefield, or conduct &quot;show trials&quot;...
<br>
<p><p>&lt;Flicking a switch to launch a cruise missile against a bunch of foaming
<br>
at the mouth fanatics only proves the point that 'discretion is the
<br>
better part of valor'.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;Cut out that character assasination crap if you want to be listened
<br>
too guy!
<br>
&lt; When fighting an enemy, you don't let him decide
<br>
on the ground and means by which you fight. You pick the time, the
<br>
ground, and the means, you do it to him first and hard. Study up on your
<br>
Sun Tsu.&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;No YOU study up on Sun Zi!  By declining to pair off with the
<br>
US/Israel Axis in a battle of fighter planes or cruise missiles or
<br>
massed infantry the terrorists DIDN'T &quot;let us decide the grounds
<br>
and means by which we fight&quot;. Have you got some major
<br>
cognitive dissonance going on guy?  9-11 may be dishonourable,
<br>
it may be despicable, but it was NOT cowardly, and it was
<br>
Tactically Brilliant (it remains to be seen whether it's strategic
<br>
brilliance will approach it's tactical merits).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's sad that American's don't read more Sun Zi.  If we knew
<br>
our enemies and knew ourselves we could often avoid fighting all
<br>
together.  As it is I will be patching and treating the soldiers of
<br>
Tel Aviv's War here in the States for years. And I sorrow
<br>
at the damage that will be done to the flower of America,
<br>
laid on the horrible &quot;neccessity&quot; of Zion's hate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what happens when you don't choose your &quot;friends&quot;
<br>
carefully.
<br>
<p>feel free to continue in the military theory vein,
<br>
