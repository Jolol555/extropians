RE: some U.S. observations and notesFrom: Smigrodzki, Rafal:
<br>
&quot;As a relatively recent European import, I retained some of the amazement that
<br>
most Europeans feel at the idea that widespread gun ownership is desirable.&quot;
<br>
<p>I find it interesting that Europeans choose to be amazed at the right to bear
<br>
arms while suppressing their amazement about American health, prosperity,
<br>
liberty, creativity, excellence, natural beauty and extropy.
<br>
<p>&quot; ...what really counts, is the statistically measurable influence of guns on
<br>
the survival of citizens.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's right, and Americans have one of the very best of records when it comes
<br>
to surviving the actions of those who have opposed private ownership of guns,
<br>
for example such anti-gun rights advocates as Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong who
<br>
murdered tens of millions of (unarmed) citizens. The measurable influence of
<br>
guns on the survival of Jewish citizens shows that they would have fared much
<br>
better against the National Socialists in Germany and Warsaw if they had been
<br>
armed.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
