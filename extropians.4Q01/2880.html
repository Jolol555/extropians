<p>&lt;&lt;DANIEL C. DENNETT: THE COMPUTATIONAL PERSPECTIVE 
<br>
<p><p>[DANIEL C. DENNETT:] If you go back 20 years, or if you go back 200 years, 
<br>
300 years, you see that there was one family of phenomena that people just 
<br>
had no clue about, and those were mental phenomena â€” that is, the very idea 
<br>
of thinking, perception, dreaming, sensing. We didn't have any model for how 
<br>
that was done physically at all. Descartes and Leibniz, great scientists in 
<br>
their own right, simply drew a blank when it came to trying to figure these 
<br>
things out. And it's only really with the ideas of computation that we now 
<br>
have some clear and manageable ideas about what could possibly be going on. 
<br>
We don't have the right story yet, but we've got some good ideas. And at 
<br>
least one can now see how the job can be done. Coming to understand our own 
<br>
understanding, and seeing what kinds of parts it can be made of, is one of 
<br>
the great breakthroughs in the history of human understanding. If you compare 
<br>
it, say, with our understanding of life itself, or reproduction and growth, 
<br>
those were deep and mysterious processes a hundred years ago and forever 
<br>
before that. Now we have a pretty clear idea of how it's possible for things 
<br>
to reproduce, how it's possible for them to grow, to repair themselves, to 
<br>
fuel themselves, to have a metabolism. All of these otherwise stunningly 
<br>
mysterious phenomena are falling into place...&gt;&gt;
