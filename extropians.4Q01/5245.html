<p><em>   &gt;The Boston Consulting Group in the late 70s or early 80s allegedly laid out
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;a strategy for Japan that consisted of lowering prices to the point that they
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;chased their competitors from the market place.  That was reported in the
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;press during that time period and I assume the press got it right.
</em><br>
<p>That may have been their strategy, it probably was,  but it hasn't worked as
<br>
expected. Japan has high unemployment and very high living expenses,
<br>
its banks are basket cases held together by glue and sealing wax limiting
<br>
future investment, many of its very largest corporations are unprofitable,
<br>
and it has the highest by far debt to gross national product ratio of any
<br>
industrial nation. Yes, America is several months into a recession but it
<br>
will probably end by summer, Japan is 12 years into the deepest recession
<br>
since world war 2 and there in no end in sight.  They have not found the formula
<br>
for success, during the last decade the Japanese have been really lousy
<br>
businessmen, they tried to protect every industry regardless of how much
<br>
money it lost and they tried to run everything centrally. In fact their
<br>
accounting practices are so crummy in their largest corporations they don't
<br>
know what parts of the company make money and what divisions don't.
