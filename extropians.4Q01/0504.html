The only change is a new parapraph at the end.
<br>
<p>Practical Life Extension
<br>
<p>Mostly people die from aging, diseases (endogenous and exogenous), 
<br>
accidents, violence, oppression, disasters, and poverty.  The 
<br>
general solutions include intelligence, learning, skills, 
<br>
collaboration, relationships, tools, resources, and attitude.
<br>
<p>The most important and demanding areas of learning are biomedical 
<br>
sciences, human interactions (group and individual), and learning 
<br>
how to learn.
<br>
<p>Biomedical sciences include aging and diseases.  For the elderly, 
<br>
aging and endogenous (internally caused) diseases are usually the 
<br>
biggest threat.  For the poor poverty is usually the biggest 
<br>
threat but they mostly die from contagious diseases (brought about 
<br>
by poor sanitation, overcrowding, and bad diet).  For the young 
<br>
and well off the biggest threat may be organized group violence 
<br>
(wars) or significant oppression, otherwise their biggest problem 
<br>
is also aging and endogenous diseases.
<br>
<p>If you want to help solve these problems start with your own 
<br>
psychology, health, and efficiency.  The _Authoritative Guide to 
<br>
Self Help Books_ is a good place to start.  Health books produced 
<br>
by major universities or hospitals will tell you plenty about 
<br>
general health.  I think Dean Edell usually gives good health 
<br>
advice and has a nice perspective.  _The Seven Habits of Highly 
<br>
Effective People_ and _A New Guide to Rational Living_ are good 
<br>
general books on psychology and efficiency.  A basic psychology 
<br>
text (Zimbardo for example) is also a nice place to start and 
<br>
will give you a bit of an introduction to science.  Reading a book 
<br>
on study skills first will get you through these books more 
<br>
quickly (_How to Study_ by Ron Fry is a good brief introduction).
<br>
<p>Starting with psychology, health, and efficiency applies to the 
<br>
elderly and the poor as well as to the young and well off.   For 
<br>
the elderly that includes knowing good doctors, understanding 
<br>
elderly health problems, dealing with any personal medical 
<br>
problems, and looking into cryonics (I can think of no better 
<br>
option for people close to death).  For the poor, attention to 
<br>
basic living needs is central.  Getting to where their biggest 
<br>
concerns are the same as the healthy wealthy (aging, endogenous 
<br>
diseases, war, oppression, and helping others) is a worthy goal.
