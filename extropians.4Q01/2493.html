<p><em>&gt; I want a world where those who act with power are

</em><br>
<p>I wish it could happen, too. I agree that a lot of outcry and moral rectitude plus
<br>
Brinlike transparency (modulo the crypto--let's not go there, I said &quot;Brinlike&quot;, not 
<br>
&quot;Brin's&quot;) sounds helpful; but... But I don't quite see how to get there from here.
<br>
Not without some sort of sea change in the population and the existing power structure(s)
<br>
and what Werner Erhart used to call &quot;the Drift&quot;.
<br>
<p>See, this automatic, inescapable stuff sounds like... a concentration of power. Again.
<br>
There's a fundamental &quot;quis custodiet?&quot; problem. It's nice work if you can get it.
<br>
This is, of course, the crux of the problem with socialists, and even with trying to
<br>
run a democracy of any size. The People must have power. OK, fine!
<br>
<p>Except they can't and won't, mostly; and more skillful operators quickly dominate. 
<br>
Also, things get delegated. Pretty soon it's meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
<br>
<p>Attention is a scarce resource. Total autonomy can really suck. Clans have costs I frequently 
<br>
dislike--xenophobia from mild to utter dehumanizing of The Other, for example. Both of these don't provide
<br>
economies of scale; but perhaps such will be outmoded someday. Perhaps.
<br>
<p>The remaining solutions? _All watched over by machines of loving grace_; and/or &quot;Gort, Barenga!&quot;
<br>
<p>&lt;Sidebar: Since some people complain when I corner hard, obligatory clue provisions: the first is an allusion to a
<br>
Brautigan work ( <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/7186/machines.html">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/7186/machines.html</a> has it), the second to the classic movie &quot;The
<br>
Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;--approximating Eliezer's FAI and Blue Goo, respectively.
<br>
<p>The most chilling line in the movie remains Klaatu's: &quot;Your choice is simple: join us and live in peace, or continue
<br>
your present course and face obliteration.&quot; &lt;&lt;Aside: Sounds like something Microsoft lawyers set as their startup .WAV
<br>
files.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Umm. Umm. Oh jeeze, Mr. Klaatu, sir. Can't I just _relinquish_ something, or something? Oh JEEZE.&gt;
<br>
<p>I don't have high confidence in either one at present. I'd _like_ to be convinced. In particular, I worry 
<br>
what dispossessed, oppressed people will take what desperate actions when the music stops and they don't like
<br>
the chair they're supposed to sit in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                        Ray Charles
</em><br>
<p>Ray, tell me how to do this. PLEASE! :)
