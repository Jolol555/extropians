<p>Its *you* as of the time of the backup if the backup and restoration
<br>
methods are completely lossless.  Any other perspective is to argue
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; has some basis in non-physical phenomena.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And that if I die, even if a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Your consciousness continues just like it would if you got bumped
<br>
on the head and &quot;forgot&quot; the last three days of your life.  Only
<br>
if the backup is to any extent &quot;invasive&quot; (so you know when they
<br>
are occuring) and you don't &quot;wakeup&quot; at exactly the same place
<br>
(and time) where the backup occurred, would you probably suspect
<br>
you were a copy...  [I'm doubtful you can &quot;restart&quot; at the same
<br>
time and place if this is really reality, but if its a simulation
<br>
then a lot of things that don't make sense will be feasible.]
<br>
<p>If you had &quot;real-time&quot; backup capability (say via a very high
<br>
bandwidth radio connection [Kurzweil has argued this but I
<br>
doubt it is feasible...]), then you will notice a hallucinatory
<br>
type &quot;break&quot; in your consciousness.  One minute you can hear
<br>
the WTC collapsing on top of you and you probably notice this
<br>
huge sensory overload and the next minute you find yourself
<br>
waking up in a hospital room (again -- probably suspecting you are
<br>
a copy).  Of course if the technology is good enough you can
<br>
rollback to prior to the plane impacts and rewrite the script
<br>
from that point forward.  You just don't have anyplace to go
<br>
to work the next day and you might have to give the eulogy
<br>
at your funeral.  :-)  That is assuming you have a spare
<br>
body around that you can be downloaded into -- otherwise
<br>
you will have to attend virtually until a clone can be grown.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 'Raelians' I believe get around this important concept by claiming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the aliens have some advanced technology that can transfer 'concioussness'
</em><br>
<p>Any *really* good technology would theoretically allow you to shift
<br>
you consciousness back and forth at will (from wetware to alternate
<br>
hardware).  It may however be the case that that proves technically
<br>
too difficult and you only get to make backups when you plug yourself
<br>
into a &quot;Matrix&quot; type fiber bundle when you go to sleep each night.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (they might have even worded it as a soul)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in addition to the 'thoughts memories and experiences'
</em><br>
<p>They are applying new terms to old &quot;religious&quot; beliefs.  My only
<br>
problem with them is that they handwave when it comes to explaining
<br>
how its done and have to make up silly reasoning that only aliens
<br>
have the technology to do it.  Perhaps the luddites get control
<br>
and we have to move to a space enclave to develop nano &amp; AI
<br>
and by the time we come back to implement the 'Raelian&quot; vision
<br>
we really are &quot;aliens&quot;.
<br>
<p>I suspect terrorism becomes a lot more difficult in the time of
<br>
uploading because once people become generally accepting of
<br>
uploading &amp; downloading (think Star Trek transporter technology
<br>
here [you *do* realize the transporters *kill* you don't you?!?]) --
<br>
then terrorist acts have to be much more clever to kill you and
<br>
your secured backups.  It becomes something like a flat tire --
<br>
you are annoyed when it happens but it doesn't ruin your whole life.
