Fiddlesticks (or why I hate press releases...)
<br>
<p>The &quot;real&quot; articles behind this are in Nature this week.
<br>
<p>Alcock, C. et al, &quot;Direct detection of a microlens in the Milky Way&quot;

&quot;Astronomy: Gravitational microlens in motion&quot;

<a href="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v414/n6864/full/414591a_fs.html">http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v414/n6864/full/414591a_fs.html</a>
<br>
<p>Starting with the LLNL Press release (provided by Damien)...
<br>
[You would think *they* could get it right given that this
<br>
is where the team is located!]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/NewsReleases/2001/NR-01-12-02.html">http://www.llnl.gov/llnl/06news/NewsReleases/2001/NR-01-12-02.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  By fusing microlensing light data, high-resolution images and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  spectroscopy, researchers can finally view a complete picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of a MACHO (Massive Compact Halo Object) by measuring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  its mass, distance and velocity.
</em><br>
<p>The key here is that they are actually using both the Hubble and
<br>
a spectrometer on the ESO VLT to do this work (that is good because
<br>
if one wants to detect a Matrioshka Brain/Dyson Shell the spectra
<br>
will be critical).  However the star and the lens are still too
<br>
close together to separate the spectra so interpretation is
<br>
&quot;complicated&quot;.  (To my uneducated eye, I'll accept the spectra
<br>
appears to be a star.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This demonstrates that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  precision brightness measurements and extensive follow-up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  will allow astronomers to characterize a significant fraction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the Milky Way's dark matter.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm,....  What the article actually says:
<br>
<p>&quot;We note that the detection of one such event in our current sample of
<br>
13-18 events is completely consistent with the expected number of
<br>
Milky Way events associated with known populations.  We have completed
<br>
HST analysis of 17 of these events, and find no other plausible candidates
<br>
for lensing by Milky Way stars.&quot;
<br>
<p>1 out of 17 isn't, IMO, a &quot;significant fraction&quot;.  Bottom line -- for most
<br>
of the events characterized so far they are just as clueless as they were
<br>
5 years ago.  The Lens magnitude (V = 22.6) is quite a bit under the limit
<br>
of the Hubble (V &gt;= 26) so I would expect that they could detect faint
<br>
stars causing lensing out to significantly greater distances.  They did not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  which turned out to be a red star in the Milky Way. 
</em><br>
<p>They postulate it is an M4-5 red dwarf with an absolute magnitude of 13.6.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  The observation makes it possible to determine the mass of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  MACHO and its distance from the Earth. In this case, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  MACHO is a small star with a mass between 5 percent and 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  percent of the mass of the sun at a distance of 600 light-years.
</em><br>
<p>Cough.  There are some pretty significant conflicts in the distance/star
<br>
type conclusions.  Using parallax, they compute the distance at 200 pc
<br>
(652 ly), but using stellar type and brightness they get 650 +/- 190 pc
<br>
(or 2120 ly).  It seems they feel the brightness measurements are less
<br>
accurate because they cannot yet measure the metalicity of the lens
<br>
(which effects brightness computations).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the ESA Press Release:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Dark Matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ESA/Hubble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hubble Spots Dark Matter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Astronomers believe they may have finally solved one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest mysteries in astronomy; or maybe they just found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another star. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, the team
</em><br>
<em>&gt; captured an image of a red dwarf star using a technique
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called microlensing; another star in front acted like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitational lens to focus the red dwarf's light to make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visible on Earth. Red dwarf stars like this could make up a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portion of what astronomers call &quot;Dark Matter&quot;.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually the star is visible without the lens (if you
<br>
have a large enough telescope).  It is also generally accepted
<br>
that there the total mass of red dwarf stars is unlikely to make
<br>
up a meaningful fraction of the Dark Matter.  It seems all we have
<br>
so far is general agreement between accepted stellar populations
<br>
(which do not include any fraction of non-visible Dysonized stars)
<br>
and the fraction of the microlensing events caused by such visible stars.
