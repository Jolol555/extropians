<em>&gt; As laudable as these things are, we have absolutely no right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impose any system of government on Afghanistan or any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country.
</em><br>
<p>I thought you said you weren't a relativist.  Some actions, including
<br>
some practices of government and/or culture, are both inherently evil
<br>
and inherently dangerous to the safety and well-being of others.  Even
<br>
the most die-hard anarcho-capitalist libertarian like me, for example,
<br>
would find it completely unacceptable for a neighbor to stockpile
<br>
biological weapons without proper safeguards near my house.  I would
<br>
have not only the right, but the ethical duty, to interfere even
<br>
before he used the weapons, because the chance of an accident
<br>
threatening my life is high enough to justify preemptive force.
<br>
If he were just keeping conventional weapons, or could convince me
<br>
that his storage methods didn't threaten me, then I'd have to back
<br>
off and respect his rights; but if I have cause to believe his actions
<br>
threaten me, I _do_ have the right to demand that he prove otherwise
<br>
or cease.
<br>
<p>It's a little harder to make a similar case for Afghanistan,
<br>
but the idea that there's _nothing_ they or any other nation
<br>
could do that would justify active intervention is nothing but
<br>
a total abrogation of the responsibility for self-defense.
<br>
If, for example, there were old Soviet nuclear weapons there,
<br>
we would be ethically required to use force to ensure that the
<br>
government set up there could properly deal with them, or else
<br>
we would have to remove them by force.
<br>
<p>It is a difficult and unsolved problem in libertarian ethics
<br>
and politics to determine exactly when and under what conditions
<br>
an imminent threat or danger rises to the level to justify
<br>
defensive force; but there is such a level, and those judgments
<br>
do have to be made.  Absolute dogmatic non-interventionism is
<br>
irrational and dangerous.
