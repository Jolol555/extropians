<em>&gt; Of course it is about oil, but it is also about support for America's

<em>&gt; unofficial ally, Israel. The American State Department career officers have
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of oil at market prices, and 2) geopolitical influence that is as broad as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible. In the cold logic of nations, this analysis is flawless. However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the feelings of many people in America and elsewhere, the only morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct action after the Nazi holocaust against the Jews was and is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support Israel against the Arabs who have always opposed Israel's existence.
</em><br>
<p><p>That isn't why we are supporting Israel.  It is an excuse.  To
<br>
the extent there is truth in it it is because many fine
<br>
upstanding and powerful Americans were supporting Hitler and/or
<br>
anti-semitism for far too long.  And now?  Now it is about oil
<br>
and about wounded pride and about face.  Some chickens are
<br>
coming home to roost so we'll declare war on chickens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a practical matter in American politics, this is also a necessity due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way political campaigns are funded, and the way that many journalists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write about the candidates and their policy positions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the pragmatists at State had had their way, the USA would have sided with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Arabs in 1948 and since, which would have virtually guaranteed our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to oil and the friendship of the world's nearly one billion Muslims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that's not the policy we pursued. Therefore, we are in the precarious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position of still needing that oil but of not having the support of most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Arabs who own it, nor of their fellow Muslims from Indonesia to Tunisia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if you think Americans are in a tough position, just consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position Israelis are in. They need oil too. But even more, they need peace,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in pursuit of which they have made enormous concessions to the Palestinians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What have they got in exchange? Ever increasing demands, and no peace;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide bombers instead of peaceful borders.
</em><br>
<p>You are dreaming. The Israelis have broken almost every
<br>
agreement they ever made with Palestinians.  The Israelis have
<br>
continually pushed for more and more Palestinian held land and
<br>
have continuously sent tanks and attack helicopters into
<br>
civilian areas.  If I was Palestinian I would hate Israeli
<br>
policies as much as many of them do. They go out of their way to
<br>
blow up Palenstenian officials and to assasinate their leaders
<br>
outright.  They blow up Palestinian police stations and then
<br>
wonder why the police don't catch terrorist.  Israle has acted
<br>
extremely slimey toward Palestinians and then claimed any
<br>
fighting back was only fanatical terrorism which just shows what
<br>
fantatical &quot;animals&quot; these Palestinians are.
