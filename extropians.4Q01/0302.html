</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anthrax is bacterial, not viral.
</em><br>
<p>Wasn't sure, and I've been hearing so much media yapping both ways...
<br>
<p>Anyways, it's good to know that its bacterial.
<br>
<p>In any event, my main point holds, that smallpox is one of the largest
<br>
viruses, so big that simple optical microscopes can see it, so just
<br>
because your mask can block it out doesn't mean it can necessarily get
<br>
smaller viral agents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; While anthrax can be treated with a vaccine (as can smallpox, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course), hanta has no vaccine at this point, so far as I know. Anybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know different?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hanta has no vaccine that I'm aware of.  However, even in regions where it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrives, it is a pretty rare type of infection.
</em><br>
<p>So few people make it a practice of getting close to large quantities of
<br>
rat excrement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hanta can be spread by the spraying of dried dust of the excrement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infected rodents. Don't know if you must ingest the dust itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I expect that the exposure levels have to be quite high before Hanta takes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like anthrax, it is endemic to certain areas and people are almost certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exposed to it regularly, yet it only rarely infects people.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's shown up in very diverse areas, even up here in Vermont and
<br>
New Hampshire, where it has infected several people. There is also no
<br>
reason why it can't be 'weaponized' like any other bioagent into a more
<br>
virulent form. The difficulty is in getting it to the point where it is
<br>
easily transmitted between humans. It is the human to human
<br>
communicability that really makes a bio agent scary. Ebola, for example,
<br>
is a very scary virus. Ditto Hong Kong Avian Flu, as well as several
<br>
developed in the Soviet labs which we are pretty sure have made it out
<br>
to the wild at one time or another.
