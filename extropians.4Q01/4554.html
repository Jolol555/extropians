<p>It ain't paranoia if they really are out to get you....
<br>
<p>I think the fact that most all detained have been released, with only a
<br>
few hundred remaining (of which over 100 have already had criminal
<br>
charges brought against them) indicates that the worry is unwarranted. I
<br>
seriously think that people are really overreacting at this point. There
<br>
are somewhere between 3-9 million muslims in the US. The temporary
<br>
detention of 0.0003-0.0001% of the pool of those allegedly being
<br>
'profiled' demonstrates that the US is being highly sensitive to a group
<br>
which to date has shown a significant lack of willingness to help root
<br>
out infiltrators, a lack of willingness to broadly and loudly condemn
<br>
the violence rationalizing of fundamentalist Islam (not surprising,
<br>
since 80% of the Imams in the US are of the Wahhabi sect), but a
<br>
significant willingness to rationalise the actions of terrorists with
<br>
the sometimes accurate, sometimes not accurate complaints about the
<br>
foreign policies of past US administrations, usually several decades in
<br>
the past, while refusing to demonstrate similar lack of satisfaction for
<br>
the governments in their home countries.
<br>
<p>Finally: Can anyone demonstrate in any case whatsoever, that an innocent
<br>
person was sent to a labor camp, or executed by the US government, of
<br>
those detained? No, they can't. Just because fascist regiemes in the
<br>
past have abused police powers does not make all police forces and
<br>
police actions equivalent to fascism.
