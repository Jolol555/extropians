<em>&gt; &gt; This is the second time you have said that you don't care why these people are

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that knowing why they are trying to kill you could be rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important since removing that reason might be much easier than stopping them from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; killing you otherwise.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is a possible strategy, but one which limits individual freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whatever happened to the non-coersion principle? The threat of death for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaving a certain way is certainly coercive, and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-extropian. Given this, the proper extropian way to counter a threat
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Maybe.  I must say i'm not an expert in the extropian way, not being one myself 
<br>
(i just hang out here cos some of the discussions are interesting).  
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Say, eg, they don't like you wearing shorts to dinner on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the first saturday of each month, then wearing something else might not be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; much trouble, or another eg, they might just want the US military out of Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Arabia, then that should be easier than killing all of them too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, and once they knew you would cave in on that, they would then say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;You have to stop making movies and tv programs which are sinful and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blasphemous.&quot; Then when you cave in to that, they will say, &quot;You have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop making televisions and computers and satellites, for they are an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affront to Allah.&quot; If you cave in on that, they will then say, &quot;All of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your women have to leave schools and cannot work outside the home, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have to wear burkhas in public and must have chaperones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
You mean there's a mandatory chain of logic from &quot;Get your military forces out 
<br>
from where i live&quot; to dictating the whereabouts, attire and doings of US women?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, so much for extropy, lets all just get it over with and become good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little submissive medeival muslim radicals. So sayeth Alejandro...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
People read amazing things in other people's writings.  (or &quot;You must forgive me, 
<br>
english isn't my first language.  That is not what i meant&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Also, as an aside, you say that they want every American dead, but i haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; heard anything like that from &quot;them&quot; (whoever they may be).  Could you give me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any pointers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Osama bin Laden's fatwa declared all Americans to be justified targets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of attack by believers, on the rationale that all Americans pay taxes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government which continues to station troops in Saudi Arabia in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense of the kingdom.
</em><br>
<p>So i've heard.  But this does not imply he wants to kill every american.  (&quot;All 
<br>
of those cars are within my price range&quot; does not imply &quot;I can buy every one of 
<br>
those cars&quot;  or &quot;We are not ruling out any weapon&quot; does not imply &quot;We will use 
<br>
every nuke on our arsenal to flatten the hills around kabul&quot;)
