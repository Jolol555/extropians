<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 49'th update of my fly longevity experiments. All bottles
<br>
contain 1/4 tsp citric acid as a standard additive. Recorded average
<br>
temperature during the experiment was 25.6 C. I will be reporting the
<br>
temperatures in future runs, since fly longevity is known to decrease with
<br>
higher temperatures. Thus if abnormally long maximum survivals are found,
<br>
such as the 118 days from a previous experiment, then this could be
<br>
directly compared with the best results at similar temperatures that have
<br>
been obtained in published experiments using the same substrain of
<br>
drosophila.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future runs I will continue to examine targeted supplements such as
<br>
antivirals, or those which may protect against motor neuron degeneration.
<br>
I will also be trying random testing of a wide variety of supplements as
<br>
well, in a search for the unexpected. To date, with the exception of
<br>
reducing the temperature (and metabolic rate) of flies, no intervention
<br>
has significantly increased maximum fly survival. Caloric restriction,
<br>
which has worked well in mice, and with some limited success in rats, is
<br>
completely without effect in flies. No supplements have convincingly
<br>
increased longevity by more than about 20%. Over a hundred supplement
<br>
tests in flies have been published, which is about as much as my own
<br>
home grown fly experiments have searched.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflicting results have been obtained in some published experiments,
<br>
which have been attributed to pathogens covertly infecting some
<br>
experiments. Under clean room conditions motor neuron degeneration has
<br>
been found to be the major determining factor of fly longevity. Drosophila
<br>
is thus an animal model of Lou Gehrig's disease (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
<br>
USA 92: 8533-8534 September 1995).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own less than sterile experiments, I believe virus induced
<br>
mortality to be a major factor in fly longevity in the summer, unless
<br>
freeze concentrated elderberry nectar is used in place of water. During
<br>
the winter usually the last few surviving flies have lost their ability to
<br>
fly before expiring, so viral infections are less of a factor in maximum
<br>
fly mortality. My eventual goal is to reduce viral load enough, so that it
<br>
no longer has a significant effect on mortality. My experiments will then
<br>
become a straight forward slugging match against motor neuron disease.
<br>
Thus far the most powerful protectant against what I believe to be viral
<br>
mediated death has been freeze concentrated Knudsen Elderberry nectar. In
<br>
a repeat of the experiment which yielded a 118 day maximum survival during
<br>
the winter, during the summer survival was 32% at 49 days, and all flies
<br>
had lost the ability to fly. Maximum survival was 54 days, or less than
<br>
half of that measured in the winter.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong color (and expense) of this juice has rendered it less than
<br>
completely desirable for use as a water replacement. However if no more
<br>
acceptible alternative comes to light in the next dozen runs, then it will
<br>
become a standard water replacement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current experiment I test the effect of a variety of fibers on
<br>
fly mortality. No benefit was seen, and in the case of xanthan gum the
<br>
reduction in longevity appears to be significant. The next run tests other
<br>
dosages of some of these fibers.
