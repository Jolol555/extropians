<em>&gt; As someone who works for them, I most emphatically disagree that WLG as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it stands today is any closer than we are to &quot;owning&quot; the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They have zero concept of AI
</em><br>
<p>I think that what brings a monopolistic corporation close to owning the
<br>
technological singularity involves the alliances the corporation has. So,
<br>
whether it's WLG or Microsoft that ends up with the patents to IT which
<br>
accompany the rights to human-competitive AI expert systems, GP, etc., depends
<br>
on which AI companies they own rather than on their ability to conceptualize
<br>
AI. It's not necessary to have a concept of internal combustion engines in
<br>
order to own a fleet of Rolls Royce automobiles. All it takes is money.
<br>
&quot;When you can buy intelligence, alliances are more important than ability.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; You forget: they think they own the law.
</em><br>
<p>But of course they are wrong.
<br>
Everyone knows that Microsoft owns the law.
<br>
©¿©¬
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The only defense they believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they need is the legal system itself, and they believe they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently defended by it against all comers, now and forever.  (No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how good a lawyer is, when the law is clear and explicit on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain matter and the facts are known well enough, the outcome tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be predetermined.  Which is kind of the point of laws.)
</em><br>
<p>Well and accurately said, and because the law works that way, nothing (not
<br>
even a technological singularity) can evade the law. As Peter Voss has pointed
<br>
out, there are several reasons why so few researchers are pursuing real AI.
<br>
(See the thread: Artificial General Intelligence Workshops) Add to his list of
<br>
reasons that AI research could become illegal.
<br>
<p>Then only outlaws will pursue real AI.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
