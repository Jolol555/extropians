<em>&gt; &gt; Okay. To John, JR, Brian, myself and others: the standard list reply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comments by Samantha, Curious, or other such individuals lacking in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ability to say non-idiotic ideas on this list is simply to type, in big,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bold letters, at the top of the message: &quot;WHAT A STUPID, IDIOTIC, IDEA!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and leave it at that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not?  It's allowed under list rules.  It's concise and to the point.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expresses your opinion accurately.  It attacks an idea as being invalid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without attacking a list member directly.  I see nothing wrong with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach.  I wish all potential flame-wars would get short-circuited with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple one-liner like this.
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly what Mike said, Harvey.  I don't think he was being
<br>
sarcastic.  I would agree too if such a one-line would actually have
<br>
some hope of short-circuiting an argument, but it never does.
<br>
<p>The only thing I've found, in over a decade of internet discussion
<br>
experience, to work is to simply back off when you encounter someone
<br>
who is plainly incapable of rational discussion on a subject.  Others
<br>
will see the statements made and make their own judgments, but one's
<br>
own rational argument is better spent on someone who shows at least
<br>
some signs of understanding.
<br>
<p>That's why, for example, I haven't replied to John on this thread
<br>
but I have replied to Smamntha.  He's clearly beyond reason, and even
<br>
though I happen to be closer to his point of view that hers, there
<br>
can be no benefit to me commenting on anything he says.  Samantha's
<br>
brain does seem to be in roughly working order, even though she does
<br>
have some problems with some fine details of reason, and is unclear
<br>
and inconsistent on some details.  But it's clearly worth the effort
<br>
to engage her, because she does actually seem to read what's written
<br>
and say what she thinks.  That's all we can ask.
<br>
