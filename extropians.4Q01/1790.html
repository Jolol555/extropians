<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Exciting gene discovery
<br>
<p>An advance online article published in the journal Proceedings of the
<br>
National Academy of Sciences, details the discovery by researchers at the
<br>
NIH National Heart Lung and Blood Institute of the ability of a gene
<br>
responsible for the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase (MsrA) to regulate
<br>
antioxidant defense in mammals.   Methionine sulfoxide reductase repairs
<br>
oxidative (free radical) damage to free and protein bound methionine, which
<br>
are especially sensitive to oxidation.
<br>
<p>In order to better understand the gene's actions, National Heart Lung and
<br>
Blood Institute researchers led by Jackob Moskovitz bred seventeen mice
<br>
lacking the MsrA gene, and compared them with twenty-two mice with at least
<br>
one copy of the gene.  When the mice lacking the gene were exposed to 100%
<br>
oxygen, creating a condition of oxidative stress, they showed greater
<br>
sensitivity than the control mice and had higher tissue levels of carbonyl
<br>
derivatives, which are oxidized protein.  The lifespan of the mice lacking
<br>
both copies of the MsrA gene averaged 40% less than the control group, with
<br>
the MsrA deficient mice experiencing shorter lifespans under both normal and
<br>
high oxygen conditions. Deletion of the MsrA gene also caused a gait
<br>
disorder in the mice to develop after the age of six months, indicating
<br>
brain damage.
<br>
<p>Oxidation of proteins by oxygen free radicals is associated with many
<br>
diseases that occur with aging.  MsrA may be important in preventing these
<br>
diseases, as well as preventing neurologic disorders, by protecting brain
<br>
cells from reactive oxygen molecules.  The researchers' next project
<br>
involves creating an animal model that overexpresses MsrA, in order to
<br>
determine if this will extend lifespan.  The finding may aid in the search
<br>
to develop antiaging drugs.

<p>Zinc prevents esophageal cancer in rats
<br>
<p>In a study published in the October 17 2001 issue of the Journal of the
<br>
National Cancer Institute, zinc-deficient rats administered the carcinogen
<br>
N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) were protected from esophageal tumor
<br>
development when zinc was later given. Zinc deficiency is known to increase
<br>
esophageal cell proliferation and the incidence of esophageal tumors induced
<br>
by this carcinogen.
<br>
<p>Five groups of rats were fed a zinc deficient diet for five weeks followed
<br>
by treatment with NMBA. Four of the five groups were then fed
<br>
zinc-replenished diets at one, 24, 72 and 432 hours following NMBA
<br>
administration. At twenty-four hours to two weeks, the esophagi of the mice
<br>
were examined for the incidence of cell proliferation or presence of
<br>
apoptosis, the programmed destruction of unwanted cells. The incidence of
<br>
tumor development was determined after fifteen weeks.
<br>
<p>Ninety-three percent of the rats who did not receive zinc replenishment
<br>
developed esophageal tumors. Zinc replenishment begun one hour after NMBA
<br>
was given reduced the incidence of tumors to only 8% of the animals. Zinc
<br>
replenishment given later was still effective, with 14% of those receiving
<br>
it after 24 hours, 19% of those receiving zinc after 72 hours, and 48% of
<br>
those receiving the mineral after 432 hours developing tumors. Twenty-four
<br>
and 30 hours after zinc was replenished, the esophagi of the rats had an
<br>
increase in apoptotic cells and double the expression of Bax protein, which
<br>
stimulates apoptosis. Zinc replenishment within an hour of NMBA
<br>
administration lowered epithelial thickness from 10-20 layers to 3-5 layers.

<p><p>Vitamin C supplements significantly associated with lower gastric cancer
<br>
risk
<br>
<p>Cancers of the stomach and esophagus have been rapidly rising for the past
<br>
three decades. In the attempt to find out why, a National Cancer Institute
<br>
sponsored study conducted by researchers at Yale University School of
<br>
Medicine discovered that vitamin C, vitamin B6, folate, beta-carotene and
<br>
fiber intake are all associated with lower rates of stomach and esophageal
<br>
cancer, and that vitamin C supplements are significantly associated with
<br>
lowered risk. Conversely, animal protein, dietary cholesterol and vitamin
<br>
B12 intake were associated with an increased risk of this type of cancer.
<br>
However, vitamin B12 is naturally associated with many animal foods.
<br>
<p>The population-based study, published in the October 2001 issue of the
<br>
journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, examined data
<br>
obtained by interview of 1,095 patients who had confirmed esophageal
<br>
adenocarcinoma, adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia, esophageal squamous
<br>
cell carcinoma, and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma, as well as 687
<br>
individuals who did not have cancer, who served as controls. Study
<br>
participants were recruited from Washington, Connecticut and New Jersey.
<br>
Data obtained during the interviews regarding nutrient intake was correlated
<br>
with cancer incidence. A separate analysis found a link between obesity and
<br>
this group of cancers.

<p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Esophageal reflux
<br>
<p>What the English have called dyspepsia or heartburn is actually esophageal
<br>
reflux. The problem is caused by the backflow of stomach acid upward into
<br>
the lower esophagus. In normal digestion, the valve that separates the
<br>
esophagus and stomach, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), opens to allow
<br>
food to pass into the stomach and then closes to prevent the food and acidic
<br>
stomach juices from flowing back up. Esophageal reflux occurs when the LES
<br>
relaxes more often than it should and/or at inappropriate times causing the
<br>
stomach contents to back up. Sometimes, particularly in obese people, the
<br>
opening through the diaphragm that allows the esophagus to pass from the
<br>
chest to the abdomen becomes large. This is called a hiatal hernia and may
<br>
result in esophageal reflux.
<br>
<p>The stomach has a lining that protects it from the effects of the acid and
<br>
because the esophagus lacks this lining, the stomach acid that refluxes will
<br>
cause pain, inflammation (esophagitis), and damage. Excessive backflow of
<br>
the stomach contents into the esophagus causes gastroesophageal reflux
<br>
disease (GERD). Untreated GERD can result in precancerous changes called
<br>
Barrett's esophagus.
<br>
<p>The constant irritation of stomach acids on the lining of the esophagus can
<br>
result in an increased risk of esophageal cancer and esophagitis.
<br>
Antioxidant nutrients can protect against esophageal inflammation and,
<br>
according to published studies, they may lower the risk of esophageal
<br>
cancer. If you suffer from heartburn, you should consider taking 3 tablets
<br>
of Life Extension Mix with each meal to help reduce your risk of esophageal
<br>
cancer and esophagitis. Life Extension Mix, is a high-potency multi-nutrient
<br>
formula containing nutrients that have been shown to reduce the risk of
<br>
gastric and esophageal cancers.

<p>Organic green tea bags
<br>
<p>Surveys conducted in Japan show that people who consumed green tea had much
<br>
lower incidence of stomach, liver, pancreatic, breast, lung, esophageal and
<br>
skin cancers. In some studies, green tea prevented cancer altogether in
<br>
animals genetically bred to develop cancer.
<br>
<p>Green tea may prevent cancer in the following ways:
<br>
<p>Neutralizing cancer-causing agents
<br>
<p>Protecting cells against mutation from cancer-causing agents
<br>
<p>Protecting against free radical damage
<br>
<p>Protecting against cellular damage from ionizing radiation

<br>
Does green tea aid in cancer prevention?
<br>
By Ivy Greenwell
<br>
<p>A review of the published scientific literature indicates that green tea has
<br>
a strong protective effect against cancer and other diseases. One study,
<br>
however, failed to demonstrate that green tea drinkers have a lower risk of
<br>
stomach cancer. The media used this study to attack the value of green tea.
<br>
In this article, we discuss the one negative report and point to numerous
<br>
positive studies that document green tea's anticancer properties. We also
<br>
reveal findings showing that stomach cancer is a preventable disease.
<br>
<p>Although the rates of gastritis and stomach cancer have declined in this
<br>
century, stomach cancer is the second most common cancer in the world, after
<br>
lung cancer. It remains the most common cause of cancer death in Japan and
<br>
Korea. Stomach cancer is also the most common cancer in China, among both
<br>
men and women.
<br>
<p>A great deal of epidemiological evidence points to certain components of a
<br>
traditional diet that appear to be causally involved in carcinogenesis: very
<br>
salty foods, smoked foods and pickled foods. Many Japanese enjoy salty
<br>
treats such as salt-cured dikon with every meal. Contrary to the sentimental
<br>
view, not all traditional ethnic foods are good for health. The
<br>
pre-refrigeration practice of preserving foods by smoking and/or heavily
<br>
salting them has a great potential for harm. A diet high in sodium and
<br>
smoked and pickled foods, especially if combined with heavy smoking and
<br>
drinking, has been repeatedly associated with increased risk of stomach
<br>
cancer. High sodium intake alone is estimated to increase the risk of
<br>
stomach cancer up to six times (Lam 1999). Thus, reducing salt intake is the
<br>
cornerstone of gastric cancer prevention.
<br>
<p>Currently, stomach cancer kills one million people every year worldwide.
<br>
This is especially tragic in view of our knowledge that stomach cancer is
<br>
relatively easy to prevent. The great majority of stomach cancer cases could
<br>
be eliminated. We can minimize the risk of stomach cancer by eradicating H.
<br>
pylori infection, avoiding heavily salted foods, smoked foods,
<br>
nitrite-containing and pickled foods, and by consuming an antioxidant-rich
<br>
diet based on fresh rather than processed food, together with supplements
<br>
known to have anticarcinogenic benefits, including vitamins C, E and
<br>
beta-carotene, selenium and green tea extract.
