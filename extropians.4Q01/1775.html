<p>I think it is necessary in addition for there to be a general social
<br>
recognition that the seller have a legitimate property right in that
<br>
which is offered for sale.  You might put a sign on your front yard
<br>
saying &quot;Breathe my air!  Only $1 per lungful!&quot; and I may take what is
<br>
offered for sale without paying for it, but few would agree that I
<br>
have committed theft.
<br>
<p>In the case of intellectual property, then, the question is whether there
<br>
is recognition of a property right in that which is offered for sale.
<br>
When someone takes your property, that is theft.  But ownership of
<br>
intellectual property differs from that of regular property, which is why
<br>
additional statutes were needed to cover it.  Copying your data doesn't
<br>
match the common understanding of theft because there is no recognition of
<br>
a conventional property right as there is with ordinary physical objects.
