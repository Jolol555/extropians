<em>&gt; OK, here we are - let's imagine there is a new planetary colony,

<p>I argue from valid theory _and_ history.  You can make up fantasy worlds
<br>
that fit any claim you want to make.  Does your model capture anything
<br>
relevant about reality?  (Rhetorical here, since I answer below that is
<br>
does not.  To me, it's kind of like the &quot;corn economy&quot; used by Adam
<br>
Smith.  See Peter Lewin's _Capital in Disequilibrium_, pp 47-52.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; New Freedom, where free yeomen till their initially equal parcels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of land and pay only minimal taxes to support a freely elected
</em><br>
constabulary.
<br>
<p>Taxes are coercive.  Elections are coercive.  You model already has
<br>
coercion built into it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As is usual, some farmers are more ingenious and hard-working than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others and in the emerging cash economy earn enough to buy land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hire some of the less smart ones to work there, for a smaller,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market-determined pay but without the hassle of running a business.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soon the land owned by the big farmers and their offspring covers a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater and greater fraction of the available land. Since having more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land gives you a better credit position, the rich can easily survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; periods of bad weather and famine, while some of the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmers are eliminated by chance - a few hectares of crop eaten by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locust, a desperate need to feed the family, a quick sale of land, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before you know, there is an underclass of landless laborers, unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to compete with large farms, unable to buy land (you need to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money to buy land but since most money in this economy comes from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land, you need land to buy land). This works like a ratchet. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are willing to work for a pittance, as there is a large supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them (it's much easier to produce a few humans than a new plot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land, so barring pestilence, war and famine, there is more people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than land), they have no choice (there is no industry on this backward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pimple of a planet)
</em><br>
<p>Another unrealistic assumption.  I'd expect some industry to arise and
<br>
technological progress -- unless there were strict controls against it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and they can only work for the large landowners,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the small farmers do not need hired hands or couldn't afford it.
</em><br>
<p>This is no more than the basic economic scenario of Karl Marx being
<br>
played out in an agrarian society on another planet.  Notably, it's not
<br>
the scenario that has ever played out in a real agrarian society without
<br>
massive coercion involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Every ten laborers you have working for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means you can buy out another small farmer who is in trouble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The freely elected constabulary will not do anything because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no crimes are committed. An oligopoly controlling land forms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spontaneously, stifling competition, slowing progress, ruthlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying its opponents. The rich soon form a hermetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aristocracy, buy control of the government, and change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name of the colony to New Colombia.
</em><br>
<p>This is unlikely for many reasons.  One, as more land gets bought up,
<br>
the incentive for people to band together against further buying up will
<br>
increase.  Such cooperation happens &quot;spontaneously&quot; in many instances --
<br>
from small businesses helping each other out to various corporations
<br>
(why wouldn't landowners just hire the right people to manage their land
<br>
for them and run it like a corporation?) and other contractual
<br>
agreements to ward off mergers and the like.  (Sometimes, it's
<br>
inefficient to do so, but beforehand, we can't always be sure that
<br>
voluntary behavior is inefficient or that coerced behavior can do
<br>
better.)
<br>
<p>Two, land will go up in value if some want to buy more and more of it.
<br>
The price will rise, meaning that owners of it will make more money.
<br>
There's no way to tell how much, but this already shows how your
<br>
scenario is a bit unrealistic.
<br>
<p>Three, you assume that inheritance alone will preserve large estates.
<br>
Historically, this has not been the case.  In fact, inherited wealth
<br>
often declines after a time.  Surely, there are exceptions, but even the
<br>
biggest family fortunes tend to get consumed over time and less
<br>
entrepreneurial and frugal family members take over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This process, the concentration of a crucial and non-expandable
</em><br>
<p>Land actually is expandable in many ways.  One, land that was formerly
<br>
marginal can become profitable if it's physically altered, e.g.,
<br>
cleared, irrigated, and plowed.  Two, if the price of land increases
<br>
overall, then more marginal pieces will be economically usable.  Three,
<br>
land can be created in the sense of reclaiming land from the sea or even
<br>
building islands.  Four, things like agriskyscrapers could create new
<br>
land on top of old land -- if they became economical.  We can't just
<br>
assume static amounts and values.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; resource in the hands of a few percent of the population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has occurred many times here on Earth. What starts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a relatively non-coercive system (neolithic farmers easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switching to a hunter-gatherer existence) becomes a slave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or feudal state. You can name Rome, England, Russia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; France, Latin America and many others as examples.
</em><br>
<p>Which of these examples started off relatively noncoercively and when?
<br>
Latin America, e.g., started off with the Spanish and Portugese empires
<br>
and though most of it is now democratic states, the basic social system
<br>
leaves much of the imperial systems locked in.  Recall the de Soto book
<br>
discussed many weeks ago?  One of his main complaints is that voluntary
<br>
systems in Latin America -- the &quot;informal economy&quot; -- is still largely
<br>
illegal.  Legalizing it would allow people to do their own thing --
<br>
still no correcting all of history, but letting them get on with
<br>
bettering themselves through longer range planning, wealth accumulation,
<br>
and trade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only revolutions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical developments break such states, forcing some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redistribution of inherited wealth, as opposed to earned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly true.  Social changes apart from technology often play a big
<br>
role -- and technology is only one factor among many.  Let's no reify
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (a very important distinction - I am in favor of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherited wealth redistribution but largely against redistribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of earned wealth),
</em><br>
<p>If people earn their wealth, by your lights, can they generally do what
<br>
they want with it?  If so, then why can't they give it to their heirs --
<br>
whoever they choose these to be?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and allowing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formation of a democracy, which is likely to be the first political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system refraining from beheading thinkers opposing it.
</em><br>
<p>Like France during the Reign of Terror.  Democracy in action!  Also,
<br>
democracies and republics tend to be the bloodies in warfare.  We have
<br>
only to look at the American Civil War, both World Wars, and US warfare
<br>
from the Persian Gulf War to today.  Some of this is, no doubt, due to
<br>
advancing technology, but part of it is also due to the concept of total
<br>
war.  When democracies fight they generally see the whole other society
<br>
as the enemy -- not just its rulers or military.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So this is my example - unregulated land market in an agrarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society will result in the destruction of freedom, virtual abolition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the market and a coercive intervention is warranted to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this from happening. Of course, merely killing the rich is a bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea - those who do the killing soon get rich, too, until the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peasant revolt.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this will be the outcome for the above state reasons.
<br>
This scenario has never played itself out without coercion involved at
<br>
every step.
<br>
<p>Note also what you're implying: we need to give up freedom to protect
<br>
freedom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instituting progressive land taxation is an option,
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that would lead to economic ineffiency by not permitting
<br>
certain voluntary arrangements.  Also, the tax money itself will be
<br>
wasted on something the taxed did not want, further distorting the
<br>
economy.  Finally, an agency strong enough to enforce it would be a
<br>
threat to the society it existed in.  There would be no reason to think
<br>
its power would be limited to just keep your model going.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; thus protecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the smaller economic units although in the long run the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of a technical economy is even better,
</em><br>
<p>But you haven't shown why this wouldn't happen spontaneously.  After
<br>
all, most people want better choices and those who can give them to them
<br>
often make a nice profit.  Why would not this dynamic provide?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; allowing relaxation of controls on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land ownership (if land stops being an important source of wealth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oligopoly control is no longer an obstacle to development). By the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, I am againt subsidizing small (or any other) farms, the way it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done in Europe and to a lesser extent in the US.
</em><br>
<p>So am I.  However, I'm generally against all coercive interventions in
<br>
society, from subsidizing small farms to taxing big ones to stealing
<br>
inherited wealth.  I also don't see how a government is somehow better.
<br>
That just institutionalizes coercion with no guarantee the government
<br>
won't just grow and grow and grow.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
