<p>It would be smarter to do both. We need more efficient energy consumers
<br>
until someone comes up with more efficient sources (efficient from a
<br>
financial viewpoint as well as from an energy viewpoint).

<p>This is true. For example, see the Village Homes links and excerpts below.

Because people get used to doing things a certain way and find it disturbing
<br>
to change, it can be difficult to get financing for truly energy-efficient
<br>
houses, and it can be a pain dealing with city ordinances written in more
<br>
primitive times. But in the long run good design is likely to be profitable.
<br>
&quot;Although turnover is very low, the few families who have left Village Homes
<br>
have realized dramatic appreciation on their homes. In 1991, houses at
<br>
Village Homes were selling for a premium of $11 per square foot over other
<br>
Davis developments, demonstrating that features once considered of
<br>
questionable value by some have become not only mainstream, but extremely
<br>
desirable.&quot; <a href="http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC35/Browning.htm">http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC35/Browning.htm</a>

<a href="http://www.sustainable.doe.gov/success/village.shtml">http://www.sustainable.doe.gov/success/village.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>==============================
<br>
The homes in the Village Homes development are 50% more energy efficient
<br>
than surrounding homes.
<br>
A 1990 study found that Village Homes residents use 36% less energy for
<br>
vehicular driving, 47% less electricity and 31% less natural gas per
<br>
household than a conventional neighborhood control group.
<br>
Tree-lined streets keep the temperature about 10% cooler than surrounding
<br>
neighborhoods.
<br>
Open space accounts for 25% of the land in the development.
<br>
Village Homes residents know 50% more of their neighbors than do residents
<br>
in nearby developments.
<br>
Initially, Village Homes sold for the same price as others in Davis. On
<br>
average, they now sell for $11 persquare foot more.
<br>
===========================
<br>
<p>Living in energy-efficient houses and neighborhoods is absolutely NOT a form
<br>
of deprivation. Well-designed houses and neighborhoods are far more pleasant
<br>
to be in than wasteful ones.
<br>
<p>I was recently reviewing and updating my goals in life and found that nearby
<br>
Austin, Texas satisfies almost all of my requirements for a pleasant place
<br>
to live: it has good libraries, outstanding performing arts--especially
<br>
music, excellent radio programming, a well educated &amp; cosmopolitan
<br>
population, beautiful parks, great book stores, lots of good restaurants,
<br>
weather that is tolerable to paradisiacal (except maybe in August when it's
<br>
hot as hell), nearby countryside that's some of the most beautiful in the
<br>
world with many springs and crystal clear streams. But it has one serious
<br>
flaw that, IMO, makes it almost uninhabitable. While the older parts of the
<br>
city were designed for pedestrian traffic and are delightful in every way,
<br>
the newer parts are strictly designed for auto traffic. And as more and more
<br>
cars clog the streets, more land is dedicated to cars, streets are widened
<br>
at the expense of sidewalks and green areas; charming old buildings are
<br>
razed to make room for parking lots, and so forth.
<br>
<p>I'm not alone in feeling this way, and the City of Austin now has what they
<br>
call a &quot;Green Building Program.&quot; Austin Green Building Program links: &quot;Why
<br>
Build Green?&quot; Note the 120,000 gallon/year water use for the average single
<br>
family household. By eliminating flush toilets and using grey water systems,
<br>
this figure can be cut dramatically. My daughter and I together use about
<br>
36,500 gallons per year. This includes watering the garden. We don't have to
<br>
deprive ourselves to achieve this figure. We take baths and use an automatic
<br>
washing machine. But the bath water, washing machine water, and kitchen
<br>
water go directly onto the garden, and our bodily and biodegradable
<br>
household wastes are composted rather than being dumped into local streams
<br>
and landfills.
<br>
<p>Note: the primer below was written in the late 1990's, so when it refers to
<br>
&quot;this&quot; century it means the 20th.

<br>
==========================
<br>
&nbsp;Energy
<br>
Structures use energy, mostly electricity and gas for things such as
<br>
lighting, appliances, heating and cooling systems, and office machines. An
<br>
average all-electric home in Austin uses 18,383-kilowatt hours of
<br>
electricity a year. This releases 266 pounds of sulfur dioxide, 99 pounds of
<br>
nitrogen oxide, nine pounds of particulate and 10.5 tons of carbon dioxide
<br>
into the atmosphere.
<br>
<p>Water
<br>
With advent of the indoor plumbing, and the rise in popularity of manicured,
<br>
green lawns, water use has risen steeply in this century. The average Austin
<br>
single family household uses 120, 000 gallons of water per year. In the
<br>
summer months, 45 percent of that is used on lawns and gardens.
<br>
<p>Materials
<br>
As more homes and structures are built, more natural resources are used and
<br>
often depleted. Our world's forests have suffered the most damage. Now, very
<br>
few old-growth forests in the United States remain. A typical 1700 sq. ft
<br>
wood frame home requires the equivalent of clear cutting one-acre of forest.
<br>
<p>Other resources used in the building industry can cause environmental damage
<br>
through mining and toxic manufacturing processes. Sometimes materials can
<br>
cause health problems for the inhabitants of the home if the material was
<br>
made with a toxic chemical that outgasses into the indoor environment.
<br>
Because Americans spend 80 to 90 percent of their time indoors, health
<br>
problems related to poor indoor air quality have risen significantly since
<br>
World War II.
<br>
<p>Solid Waste
<br>
Finally, people create waste. Americans generate about twice as much garbage
<br>
per person as Europeans or Japanese. Nationally, we throw away enough
<br>
aluminum every three months to rebuild the entire commercial airline fleet.
<br>
It's no secret that landfill space in the country is rapidly declining.
<br>
=============================
<br>
<p><p>Here'a another excerpt from the first Village Homes article cited above:
<br>
<p>============================
<br>
<p>Village Homes has vindicated many of the experimental architectural and
<br>
land-use ideas of architect/developer Michael Corbett. Over the strenuous
<br>
objections of city planning and public works departments and the FHA,
<br>
Michael pressed for and accomplished a visionary design that has paid off in
<br>
unexpected bonuses both for the environment and for the residents of Village
<br>
Homes.
<br>
<p>The narrow, tree-lined streets of Village Homes run east to west and feed
<br>
out to an adjacent minor arterial street. Houses are oriented north-south
<br>
along the streets to maximize solar exposure. Carports or garages and small
<br>
fenced and landscaped courtyards face the street.
<br>
<p>Streets are much narrower than conventional subdivision streets to
<br>
discourage traffic and allow trees to shade the road during the Central
<br>
Valley's intense summer heat.
<br>
<p>The concept of using narrower streets is one example of Michael's holistic
<br>
design approach, in which unexpected benefits arise from environmentally
<br>
governed choices.
<br>
<p>&quot;You know you're on the right track when you notice that your solution for
<br>
one problem accidentally solved several other problems,&quot; Michael says. &quot;When
<br>
you minimize the use of automobiles to conserve fossil fuels, for example,
<br>
this also reduces noise, conserves land by minimizing streets and parking,
<br>
beautifies the neighborhood, and makes it safer for children.&quot;
<br>
<p>An additional unanticipated benefit of the narrower streets is that the air
<br>
temperature over the street is 10 to 15 degrees lower than surrounding
<br>
neighborhoods during the hot summer months. This is attributed both to a
<br>
reduction in the heat-soaking asphalt mass and the mature trees, which shade
<br>
&nbsp;more of the street area than would occur in a typical development.
<br>
<p>Initial concerns on the part of city planning officials regarding the
<br>
ability of emergency vehicles to negotiate the streets were met by mandatory
<br>
30-foot easements on both sides of the street.
<br>
<p>Despite official concerns, the crime rate at Village Homes is only 10
<br>
percent of the average for Davis, according to the Police Department.
