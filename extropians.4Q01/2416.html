1. we can smash enough of them to intimidate them so they can't attack us on  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American soil.
<br>
<p>2. The other countries are indeed meddling in American affairs by looking the 
<br>
other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way, while their citizens in terror groups set up the financing and 
<br>
arrying out of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attacks against Americans.
<br>
<p>This is what has actually occured. This is not conjecture. The USA is a big 
<br>
power that is justifiably angry at what has happended, and undoubtably will 
<br>
happen again unless we dispaly the political will to change things that other 
<br>
counties lack the will to do and don't care. Being viewed as the &quot;nice guy&quot; 
<br>
does us no good, if our people are getting murdered. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;1. Find the person(s) responsible for the Sept 11 atrocity and kill 
<br>
him/them.
<br>
<p>2. Give up on breaking terrorists. There are too many and they hate 
<br>
Americans.
<br>
Eventually they'll die. Maybe they might kill each other.
<br>
<p>3. Stop meddling in other countries' governments. (Maybe then, fewer
<br>
terrorists will hate Americans, and maybe fewer foreigners will be
<br>
annoyed at Americans).
<br>
<p>4. Let people in other countries find what's appropriate for their own
<br>
culture, make their own mistakes, and so on. If they ask for your help,
<br>
then give it to them, if you can, and preferably, not with the help of
<br>
the government.
<br>
<p>4. Practice respect for people, places, and cultures outside
<br>
of the U.S. borders.
