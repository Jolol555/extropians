<p>Sorry for the bandwidth waste, but thought I'd post the whole thing to
<br>
really nail home the point. Apologists, go at it.
<br>
<p>NOTE: Just because I think Binnie and his band of thugs should be put
<br>
out of our misery doesn't mean I stand behind what the US government
<br>
has done abroad, nor what Israel is doing to Palestinians. That kind
<br>
of either/or dualistic thinking is what makes both you liberals and
<br>
you conservatives susceptible to enemy and &quot;friendly&quot; spin tactics.
<br>
You'll note that in addition to the bloody-minded ravings that
<br>
necessitate our current defensive efforts, the fatwa also echoes what
<br>
may be legitimate concerns shared by the Muslim world. I say nail
<br>
Binnie and his cavemen good and hard, then elect a non-interventionist
<br>
government, publicly tell Israel to solve its own disputes on its own
<br>
dime if it doesn't like the peace planse we propose, and either
<br>
replace the CIA with something resembling a competent and accountable
<br>
intel agency or get rid of it altogether.
<br>
<p>Now then, let's get to the document in question, shall we?
<br>
<p>- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Published in Al-Quds al-'Arabi on Febuary 23, 1998
<br>
<p>Statement signed by Sheikh Usamah Bin-Muhammad Bin-Ladin; Ayman
<br>
al-Zawahiri, leader of the Jihad Group in Egypt; Abu- Yasir Rifa'i
<br>
Ahmad Taha, a leader of the Islamic Group; Sheikh Mir Hamzah,
<br>
secretary of the Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Pakistan; and Fazlul Rahman, leader
<br>
of the Jihad Movement in Bangladesh
<br>
<p>Praise be to God, who revealed the Book, controls the clouds, defeats
<br>
factionalism, and says in His Book &quot;But when the forbidden months are
<br>
past, then fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them, seize
<br>
them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of
<br>
war)&quot;; and peace be upon our Prophet, Muhammad Bin-'Abdallah, who said
<br>
&quot;I have been sent with the sword between my hands to ensure that no
<br>
one but God is worshipped, God who put my livelihood under the shadow
<br>
of my spear and who inflicts humiliation and scorn on those who
<br>
disobey my orders.&quot; The Arabian Peninsula has never--since God made it
<br>
flat, created its desert, and encircled it with seas--been stormed by
<br>
any forces like the crusader armies now spreading in it like locusts,
<br>
consuming its riches and destroying its plantations. All this is
<br>
happening at a time when nations are attacking Muslims like people
<br>
fighting over a plate of food. In the light of the grave situation and
<br>
the lack of support, we and you are obliged to discuss current events,
<br>
and we should all agree on how to settle the matter.
<br>
<p>No one argues today about three facts that are known to everyone; we
<br>
will list them, in order to remind everyone:
<br>
<p>First, for over seven years the United States has been occupying the
<br>
lands of Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian Peninsula,
<br>
plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, humiliating its
<br>
people, terrorizing its neighbors, and turning its bases in the
<br>
Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring
<br>
Muslim peoples.
<br>
<p>If some people have formerly debated the fact of the occupation, all
<br>
the people of the Peninsula have now acknowledged it.
<br>
<p>The best proof of this is the Americans' continuing aggression against
<br>
the Iraqi people using the Peninsula as a staging post, even though
<br>
all its rulers are against their territories being used to that end,
<br>
still they are helpless. Second, despite the great devastation
<br>
inflicted on the Iraqi people by the crusader-Zionist alliance, and
<br>
despite the huge number of those killed, in excess of 1
<br>
million... despite all this, the Americans are once against trying to
<br>
repeat the horrific massacres, as though they are not content with the
<br>
protracted blockade imposed after the ferocious war or the
<br>
fragmentation and devastation.
<br>
<p>So now they come to annihilate what is left of this people and to
<br>
humiliate their Muslim neighbors.
<br>
<p>Third, if the Americans' aims behind these wars are religious and
<br>
economic, the aim is also to serve the Jews' petty state and divert
<br>
attention from its occupation of Jerusalem and murder of Muslims
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>The best proof of this is their eagerness to destroy Iraq, the
<br>
strongest neighboring Arab state, and their endeavor to fragment all
<br>
the states of the region such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan
<br>
into paper statelets and through their disunion and weakness to
<br>
guarantee Israel's survival and the continuation of the brutal crusade
<br>
occupation of the Peninsula.
<br>
<p>All these crimes and sins committed by the Americans are a clear
<br>
declaration of war on God, his messenger, and Muslims. And ulema have
<br>
throughout Islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an
<br>
individual duty if the enemy destroys the Muslim countries. This was
<br>
revealed by Imam Bin-Qadamah in &quot;Al- Mughni,&quot; Imam al-Kisa'i in &quot;Al-
<br>
Bada'i,&quot; al-Qurtubi in his interpretation, and the shaykh of al-Islam
<br>
in his books, where he said &quot;As for the militant struggle, it is aimed
<br>
at defending sanctity and religion, and it is a duty as
<br>
agreed. Nothing is more sacred than belief except repulsing an enemy
<br>
who is attacking religion and life.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>On that basis, and in compliance with God's order, we issue the
<br>
following fatwa to all Muslims The ruling to kill the Americans and
<br>
their allies--civilians and military--is an individual duty for every
<br>
Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it,
<br>
in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque from their
<br>
grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of
<br>
Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in
<br>
accordance with the words of Almighty God, &quot;and fight the pagans all
<br>
together as they fight you all together,&quot; and &quot;fight them until there
<br>
is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith
<br>
in God.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is in addition to the words of Almighty God &quot;And why should ye
<br>
not fight in the cause of God and of those who, being weak, are
<br>
ill-treated and oppressed--women and children, whose cry is 'Our Lord,
<br>
rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for
<br>
us from thee one who will help!'&quot;
<br>
<p>We -- with God's help -- call on every Muslim who believes in God and
<br>
wishes to be rewarded to comply with God's order to kill the Americans
<br>
and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it. We also
<br>
call on Muslim ulema, leaders, youths, and soldiers to launch the raid
<br>
on Satan's U.S. troops and the devil's supporters allying with them,
<br>
and to displace those who are behind them so that they may learn a
<br>
lesson.
<br>
<p>Almighty God said &quot;O ye who believe, give your response to God and His
<br>
Apostle, when He calleth you to that which will give you life. And
<br>
know that God cometh between a man and his heart, and that it is He to
<br>
whom ye shall all be gathered.&quot;
<br>
<p>Almighty God also says &quot;O ye who believe, what is the matter with you,
<br>
that when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of God, ye cling so
<br>
heavily to the earth! Do ye prefer the life of this world to the
<br>
hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with
<br>
the hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous
<br>
penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in
<br>
the least. For God hath power over all things.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Almighty God also says &quot;So lose no heart, nor fall into despair. For
<br>
ye must gain mastery if ye are true in faith.&quot;
<br>
<p>- -- 
<br>
* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
<br>
* honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
<br>
* and its Jihad.&quot;                                                   *
