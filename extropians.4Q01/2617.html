Doing Everything Wrong

<p>[Posted November 13, 2001]
<br>
<p>Despite yet another half-point cut in interest rates from three of the world
<br>
's more important central banks--as well as various reductions from a host
<br>
of their satellites--the noose is gradually tightening around banks and
<br>
financial institutions everywhere, not just in the Asia, but in the U.S.,
<br>
Europe, and Canada, too, as news arrives of multiple increases in loan loss
<br>
provisions, matched by default rates on corporate bonds which climb ever
<br>
nearer to post-Depression highs.
<br>
<p>This clearly demonstrates how widespread is the banking tug-of-war between
<br>
the beneficial cash flow impact to be expected from artificially lowered
<br>
funding costs, steeper yield curves and higher bond prices, and the
<br>
detrimental effects of past poor lending decisions and VC follies on profits
<br>
and, more importantly, capital.
<br>
<p>Not that the effects will be confined to those nations. Consider that the
<br>
latest data for the UK show that lending to the household sector has
<br>
increased 1.75 times as fast as disposable income this past year, taking the
<br>
debt ratio to nearly 108 percent in the process.
<br>
<p>In Australia, too, for much of the past year, credit to individuals has
<br>
accounted for fully three-quarters of all lending, and has similarly
<br>
outstripped income gains, having grown at 10.3 percent in a year. It is not
<br>
just in the U.S. that overstretch is endemic.
<br>
<p>We have said before that whereas capital is the loan of the fruits of past
<br>
labor, credit is a promise of labor to come. Making that promise in any
<br>
form, in isolation from prior saving, can cause distortion enough, but when
<br>
individuals give that pledge, they are usually doing it for the sole purpose
<br>
of extra consumption.
<br>
<p>Since we argue that consumption is the destruction of value (not the source
<br>
of whatever &quot;effective demand&quot; is supposed to mean), extra consumption
<br>
implies that we are not only destroying value currently being created--and
<br>
so reducing the surplus that can go to replacing and augmenting the pool of
<br>
productive resources which originally gave rise to the goods we consume--but
<br>
that we must be eating into past value as well.
<br>
<p>Such past value can only be stored, of course, in one form: capital.
<br>
<p>Ergo, consumer credit, unmatched by consumer savings, helps destroy capital
<br>
and so lessens the ability to provide for future consumption.
<br>
<p>In essence, you can't have your Tomorrow and eat it.
<br>
<p>This means we must look askance at the joy that has greeted the advent of
<br>
zero-interest auto loans and question the deeper implications of yet another
<br>
wave of mortgage refinancing to be triggered by secularly low interest rates
<br>
on both sides of the Atlantic.
<br>
<p>Adding in this element of consumer finance tends to exacerbate the standard
<br>
business cycle phenomenon, whereby the extension of too much nonsaved credit
<br>
to producers artificially lowers the rate of interest, making marginal
<br>
projects appear profitable while confusing those producers into thinking
<br>
that this lower rate signals that there is sufficient slack in the system
<br>
for them to be able to complete their undertakings in line with their
<br>
entrepreneurial estimates.
<br>
<p>This latter tends to misallocate capital by distorting both the time and
<br>
price structure of production, and the more credit involved, the greater the
<br>
likely scale of errors. Indeed, if individuals are not only not saving more,
<br>
but actually borrowing themselves, for the purposes of ready gratification,
<br>
they are making the miscalculation both more likely and more costly.
<br>
<p>So, we have a situation where one sector is consuming capital and the other
<br>
sector is probably misusing what little there is left.
<br>
<p>Look at U.S. GDP. Net capital accumulation has undergone a 30-percent plunge
<br>
in five quarters, the second steepest fall since WWII.
<br>
<p>The financial craziness in the wildcat 1980s took this net capital
<br>
accumulation to its nadir at the depths of the 1991 slump, to its lowest
<br>
peacetime proportion of GDP since the Great Depression. The recovery back to
<br>
median values  (gerrymandered by statistical redefinition as it may have
<br>
been), came thirteen long years after it first dropped below them.
<br>
<p>Alas, we are already back in the downwave after what we were told was a
<br>
miracle, but which seems to have been little more than a mean reversion. We
<br>
can only guess how much damage has been done to the patient's constitution
<br>
by the libertine lifestyle he enjoyed while his disease was in remission
<br>
during the Bubble.
<br>
<p>Depressions unfold over years, even decades, much like global conflicts.
<br>
Those of us wedded to the ticker tape and twenty-four-hour rolling news
<br>
would do well to recall that once in a while, in the effort to make sure
<br>
that the minutiae of daily tactics do not blind us to the broad sweep of
<br>
grand strategy.
<br>
<p>Eventually, all this discoordination ends in calamity. End products cannot
<br>
be sold at a price to cover the costs of input and rent: those inputs
<br>
themselves, being competed for more fiercely than was reckoned, cost more to
<br>
begin with. Businesses stumble. They strive to shed costs by reining in
<br>
expenditure and investment and laying off workers.
<br>
<p>The structure of production not only shortens as capital goods and raw
<br>
materials industries scale back in favor of firms providing consumer goods
<br>
and services, causing the flow of corporate revenues to fall, but, if the
<br>
problem is big enough and the rigidities are too insurmountable, overall
<br>
production shrinks, and with it income as well.
<br>
<p>Two things must be noted. Capital has been consumed and misused. Everyone
<br>
would surely be forced to concur that the sooner we cease the first and the
<br>
quicker we attempt to correct the second, the better it will be for all of
<br>
us.
<br>
<p>Instead, what do we find? Interest rates are slashed, reserves are injected
<br>
by the central bank, and the mindless chant--&quot;The economy depends on the
<br>
consumer, the economy depends on the consumer&quot;--is repeated over and over
<br>
again, as if a farm thrives on the crows pecking at the corn, or as if a
<br>
boat can be saved from foundering by washing it over the levee on a flood
<br>
surge.
<br>
<p>Every extra dollar borrowed by a consumer now puts us all a dollar further
<br>
from recovery, the debtor a dollar closer to default, and his bank a dollar
<br>
closer to a bigger loan loss provision than it would have had to face by
<br>
foreclosing while there was still something to be salvaged.
<br>
<p>Every extra million dollars borrowed by a producer now puts us a million
<br>
dollars further from recovery, as the company gets a million dollars with
<br>
which to freeze up suboptimally used capital, to engage in a price war, to
<br>
hoard labor and so to drag down its leaner, but perhaps less creditworthy,
<br>
competitor. This also takes its bank, or bondholder, a million dollars
<br>
closer to losses not only there, but elsewhere in their stable of industrial
<br>
borrowers, weakened by the lingering death of our lame duck.
<br>
<p>All this would be bad enough, but we have government in the game. Even
<br>
without the war itself, we have U.S. duties on lumber and tariffs on steel,
<br>
we have farm aid and airline cash, we have increased welfare payments and,
<br>
in the UK and Australia, public-sector recruitment drives. We have workweek
<br>
restrictions in the likes of France and proposals to increase the minimum
<br>
wage in several countries.
<br>
<p>Even without the war, we are doing everything wrong that the
<br>
Hoover-Roosevelt-McDonald governments and the Strong-Norman bankers did in
<br>
the 1930s, after their long decade of easy money and paper prosperity
<br>
imploded under the weight of too much debt and too great a strain on real
<br>
capital resources. Frustrating the market mechanism can cause it to seize
<br>
completely. Rarely can a complex watch be forced to a different rhythm
<br>
without irreparable damage to its delicate mainspring and levers.
<br>
<p>All traders know the injunctions, &quot;Cut your losses&quot; and &quot;Never add money to
<br>
a losing trade,&quot; and the traders themselves know that the surest way to swap
<br>
places with the Wall Street shoeshine boy is to fight against the market's
<br>
natural dynamic of searching for a clearing price.
<br>
<p>Might it not be possible for the policymaking elite to take such
<br>
incontestable rules of thumb from financial markets and transplant them to
<br>
their doings in the wider world?
<br>
<p>Sadly--if their obsession with price-fixing and manipulation in oil futures
<br>
and gold bullion, in forex and short-term interest rates, in stock indexes
<br>
and now long Treasury bonds, is any guide--they cannot.
<br>
<p>Apres lui le deluge, we might say.
