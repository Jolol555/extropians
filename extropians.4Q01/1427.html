</em><br>
<p>Well, the projectile is a sabot design that Bull designed in his work in
<br>
Canada, and he also developed mechanisms to inject gasses into the wake
<br>
of the projectile to reduce decelleration (as well as full rocket
<br>
systems). Bull's entire life focus was on developing a gun to put things
<br>
in orbit, and he didn't care who funded him. He did not figure on
<br>
Hussein using his gun to deliver bio or nuke weapons, or perhaps he was
<br>
hoping that someone in the west would outbid Hussein in keeping him
<br>
funded.
<br>
<p>1400 G's is not extremely difficult to harden the projectile for, but I
<br>
suspect Bull had hoped that it would be beyond Hussein's ability to
<br>
produce mechanisms for bio/nuke attack that could do it.
