<p>I have something like that too, but its only part of the time.  When Im
<br>
pessimistic I think my pessimism is winning but when Im optimistic
<br>
my optimism is winning.
<br>
<p>Right now my optimism is winning big time.
<br>
<p>Stop and look at what has happened, friends.  Look at what we were
<br>
saying about a year ago regarding the Taliban.  We went on at length
<br>
about what bastards they are, and how we need to overthrow them
<br>
with whatever means are at our disposal, even if we need to soil our
<br>
hands in order to do it.  Read in the archives where we speculated
<br>
there must be millions of Afghan intellectuals, gays, rebels, atheists,
<br>
extropians, and plain old guys who will dance in the streets when
<br>
the Taliban is crushed.
<br>
<p>We were right!  We were right all along.  The suffering of
<br>
the people under the Taliban has been unimaginable.  We may never
<br>
find out how bad it was, for those who suffered the most have no
<br>
voice, and indeed are most likely now dead, slain by the oppressors.
<br>
<p>History will record this regime as being worse than the Nazis,
<br>
and we will again castigate ourselves for not acting sooner and
<br>
more decisively.  But still we have cause for optimism.  The
<br>
Taliban are shooting each other now, each suspecting the other
<br>
of wanting to surrender.  Tho wounded, the good guys win
<br>
this round.  spike
