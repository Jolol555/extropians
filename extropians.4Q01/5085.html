<p>
it's not a big deal.  every hypothesis has a cohypothesis or subhypothesis 
<br>
that lurks;  there is always a non-scientific element that drives scientific 
<br>
exploration (the human in control).  we search for things in a specific 
<br>
direction because we want that specific direction to have the most &quot;reality&quot; 
<br>
as, we, another could have decided to go the other way.  what makes us want 
<br>
the information?  is the desire only driven by &quot;to make reality more real&quot; 
<br>
or to make &quot;one aspect of yet-classified reality more real&quot;.  its like there 
<br>
are a finite amount of work-units.  you can take 8 of them from glob D and 
<br>
put them somewhere else to work for a while.  glob D relapse.  so what if he 
<br>
put artifical-lynx-location hairs in the report to stop something political. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;i can totally envision the scientists in the office coming up with the 
<br>
idea.  the agency was never supposed to run that kind of testing anyway.  it 
<br>
kind of stops being &quot;real science&quot; when it involves zoning and govt 
<br>
fund-allocation, doesn't it?
<br>
<p>is anyone familiar with the non-gleamable-from-documentation culutral 
<br>
information about dallas and/or san antonio, texas, united states?  the 
<br>
information that is obtainable only via social interaction, and overall 
<br>
city-energy and new-object analysis.  has anyone experienced it?  using 
<br>
plano, frito-lay factories, and seven-eleven as inverse controls.
<br>
<p>monopolis,
<br>

<p>&quot;Federal and state wildlife biologists planted false evidence of a rare
<br>
cat species in two national forests, officials told The Washington Times.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sigh...
