<p><em>&gt; Why, Alex, you are so very nice today.  Why so nice? Are you feeling guilty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about your little feeding frenzy the other day during our immigration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;debate&quot;?  Your  response, and the response of others to the same subject,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascinates me.  Because of the demonization of the entire &quot;debate&quot;, when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject is broached in a forum, a certain significant percentage of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people feel completely justified in just going apesh*t, like a white shark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a crippled seal.  It reminds so much of Shirley Jackson's short story,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _The Lottery_.
</em><br>
<p>When you post useful information, particularly in my field and
<br>
sub-field, I do my best to make a constructive contribution (because I
<br>
try to be a good little Prisoner's Dilemma player). I don't pay much
<br>
attention to from lines. Information is information, and thankfully
<br>
your previous post had nothing to do with your immigration opinions,
<br>
so I didn't see that as the appropriate time to lambast them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The animal comes out in homo sapiens, given a socially acceptable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity.  Those with the money to finance a longterm demonization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those citizen-owners who oppose immigration, have found considerable success
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in being able to attach to the opposition the &quot;black dot&quot;. We are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrifial lamb, approved by the social elite. A great way to win any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;debate&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I do hope you understand my frothing at the mouth as some pointed fun
<br>
at your expense rather than an expression of genuine hatred! Anyway,
<br>
no shit that I and other humans are animals. Admitting that is
<br>
basically a requirement for membership in the materialist club. Many
<br>
Extropians add to that &quot;but someday, we will be more than animals&quot; but
<br>
I believe that someday we'll be vastly powerful, wise, complex,
<br>
subtle...  animals. There's no shame in that, and I'll take it over
<br>
being an inanimal any day.
<br>
<p>My basic quarrel with your views on immigration is that they
<br>
presuppose the existance of national boundaries. The only entities I
<br>
recognize are myself, other individuals, and all of humanity. Any
<br>
intermediate groupings I belong to are at best temporary alliances to
<br>
further the interests of real entities. Removing government
<br>
micromanagement and allowing market forces to equilibrate the global
<br>
demand and supply for labor should fix whatever it is that's wrong
<br>
with current immigration policies... *if* an efficiently run and
<br>
equitable system is the ultimate goal. See below.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, as I see it the spirit of the Constitution is not &quot;Only
<br>
America should be of, by, and for the people&quot;. Rather it's &quot;Society in
<br>
general should be of, by, and for the people, but so far we've only
<br>
had enough guns and money to liberate this chunk of continent. We wish
<br>
you the best in liberating yourselves wherever it is you live.&quot; Of
<br>
course that became mutated to &quot;We will overthrow your government and
<br>
replace it with a puppet regime friendly to our government, thus
<br>
contributing to the world refugee problem&quot; but that probably belongs
<br>
in one of the many Middle East threads.
<br>
<p>You know, I'll even live up to the good name you gave me and actually
<br>
be nice. Here is the *real* conflict I have about immigration:
<br>
<p>Is government intervention bad because it causes inefficiency by
<br>
distorting the proper market value of real estate, education, wages,
<br>
etc? Or is this inefficiency worth it because it creates areas with
<br>
high concentrations of technological infrastructure and educated
<br>
workers so that technology progresses faster than it would if
<br>
wealth/people/tech were distributed purely according to the dynamics
<br>
of a perfectly competitive market?
<br>
<p>If you can give me reasons for believing the second alternative, or
<br>
some rational criticisms of my premises, I may actually have little to
<br>
disagree with you about as far as immigration is concerned. Let's just
<br>
stay away from romantic metaphors, because they make the difference
<br>
between a valid contrarian viewpoint and a rant (of the sort we've
<br>
both been guilty of recently, myself especially).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the bloodlust exhibited by the stone throwers....ah, a window into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind of the homo sapiens beast.  That such eager and zealous bloodlust can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist side by side with the capacity to make music and science....
</em><br>
<p>Yes, yes, it is a paradox isn't it? GrreeAAAAAaaarghhh! Ook.
