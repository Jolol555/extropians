Don't forget the coast.  Many people live next to the sea (such as
<br>
myself) and would like to have both energy and potable water.  I suggest
<br>
getting both at the same time by building large solar collectors that
<br>
are spherical on the outer surface, and reflective paraboloids on the
<br>
inner surface.  These would be fitted with a boiler chamber at the focus
<br>
and tethered to the sea floor with cables.  Winders on the cables would
<br>
be used to track the sun (might be able to power those off wave and tide
<br>
action most of the time).  Then run insulated high pressure steam lines
<br>
to the shore, or to generators on barges near by.  What comes out of the
<br>
turbines condenses as nice hot drinking water.
<br>
<p>With the right engineering, I think these could be made very cheap.  It
<br>
is mostly just a fixed structure.  The hard part it getting it to stand
<br>
up to most storms and general marine rot.  The boiler could be very
<br>
simple because you can depressurize and flush it every night, whereas
<br>
continuous boilers fed salt water are a pain to keep going.  Perhaps a
<br>
system with land based turbines could have enough live steam storage to
<br>
last into the evening hours, or the boilers could have enough phase
<br>
change salt built in to do the same thing.
<br>
<p>I first thought of this for off the coast of LA.  A factory could be set
<br>
up there to use the waste plastic and aluminum generated by the city to
<br>
make these things.  I pictured them being plopped out of the place like
<br>
eggs, then towed out to sea.  As long as toxic chemicals did not diffuse
<br>
out of them too much, the environmentalists should go for it, and think
<br>
how great a few square miles of these things would look, about 100m high
<br>
and each tracking the sun.
<br>
<p>On the solar biomass front, I am now leaning to a system that is just a
<br>
cable that goes out into the sea and loops back.  If you spray that with
<br>
gametophytes from Macrocystis pyrifera it will grow all over it and
<br>
actually float the cable.  When this stuff gets going it can grow 20cm a
<br>
day.  You would time the cable loop rate so that it gets back to land
<br>
when the stalks have finished growth cycle, at which point the cable
<br>
hauls them out of the sea and into your processing plant.  If folks do
<br>
not like the looks of the processing plants on shore, you can still do
<br>
this from factory ships that are towing the cables behind them.
<br>
<p>Macrocystis will grow almost anywhere there is sunshine, upwelling for
<br>
nutrients, and something to hang on to.  If you go somewhere with
<br>
sunshine, and provide the cable to hang on to, all you may need is to
<br>
put some small amount of special nutrients on the cable to diffuse into
<br>
the water simulating upwelling.  Again, it is an existing replacator
<br>
that will do most of the work building you a very big solar system.
