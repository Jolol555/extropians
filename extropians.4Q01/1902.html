<br>
<em>&gt; Is anyone looking for a hypothesis under which intelligent life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would happen, not once in a galaxy, but once in a Universe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or once in every 10^8 Universes?
</em><br>
<p>Why would you care if it happens in other Universes?  Are you
<br>
assuming inter-universe travel is possible?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because a rarity of once in a galaxy isn't enough to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Fermi Paradox, not nearly.
</em><br>
<p>I assume you are saying this because intergalactic travel is
<br>
feasible.  Without wanting to startup a whole long discussion
<br>
on the topic (because I should really finish the papers that
<br>
explain it clearly and those papers are 6 levels down in
<br>
my paper push down stack), intergalactic travel suffers
<br>
even more than interstellar travel from the time delay
<br>
effect.  Looking at the LMC, when I happen to be in the
<br>
Southern Hemisphere, I have no idea whether or not it
<br>
is still there.  It could be completely colonized by now,
<br>
in which case I should only plan to colonize it if I'm
<br>
willing to take it by force.  The only real way I can
<br>
see for intergalactic colonization to occur is if you
<br>
wait for the galaxies to collide so your information
<br>
about its &quot;state&quot; is up-to-date.  In which case colonization
<br>
doesn't occur at velocities limited by some significant
<br>
fraction of the speed of light but by the velocities of
<br>
galaxies (as well as the vectors that cause them to collide)
<br>
That has to be much slower, and will slow down further as
<br>
the universe expands.
