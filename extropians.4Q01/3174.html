<br>
why it was not exploded over Tokyo Bay, which was considered at the time, but 
<br>
instead over populated cities.  Also, the &quot;we will be forced to invade Japan&quot; 
<br>
story is by no means certain, there is every reason to believe that 
<br>
capitulation was in the offing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose people that like to theorise will chew on this one for 
<br>
years.  After all is there anything so much fun as arguing a point of view 
<br>
that requires ones opponent to prove a negative?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I lived through that time, I wasn't Truman's confidant but my 
<br>
take is that the weapon wasn't proven to be reliable enough to chance a 
<br>
&quot;demonstration, the million American casualties was logical to be believable 
<br>
except to armchair theorists, it had been a hard fought war with little 
<br>
humanity shown us and our loved ones were still in danger if we attemted an 
<br>
invasion so we bombed them without thought of mercy. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is a story about Truman that sums it all up.  Someone 
<br>
asked Truman how long he considered his decision before deciding to bomb.  He 
<br>
is supposed to have indicated that his decision was almost instantaneous.  It 
<br>
had been that kind of war.
