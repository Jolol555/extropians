<p>It isn't clear to me precisely what caused communism to fragment.
<br>
I doubt the Cold War did it as well.  It isn't clear to me whether
<br>
the Regan arms build up stressed the Soviet economy to the breaking
<br>
point or whether it simply fell apart of its own inertia.

<p>I don't believe in pushing any idealogy other than the one
<br>
that people should be free and some form of a democratic
<br>
government is better than an oppressive government not
<br>
chosen by a majority of the people.  I might want to
<br>
push the concept of fundamental human rights, along
<br>
the lines of U.N. treaties (I haven't read them in detail
<br>
to be sure I fully agree with them).
<br>
<p>I believe that only 2 countries in the world had relations
<br>
with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.  I think that says
<br>
a *lot* about the number of people who generally thought we
<br>
were better off without that group.
