Loglan (/Lojban) has some constructs akin to this, IIRC.
<br>
<p>Ever hear of the humble &quot;po&quot;?
<br>
<p>Edward de Bono coined it as a prefix for, roughly, &quot;the following is a provocative 
<br>
hypothetical and I am marking it as such; discuss, but let's not waste time falling
<br>
into troll responses.&quot; The latter is actually pretty much implied in much of de Bono's
<br>
work; I have no way of knowing how many list members are familiar with his &quot;six thinking
<br>
hats&quot; and other work.
<br>
<p>Examples: 
<br>
Po cars should have square wheels. (lateral thinking)
<br>
Po any AI without an L-box should be terminated with extreme prejudice. (blunt proposal)
<br>
<p>I used &quot;po&quot; for about a month on this list, and a few other places. I made the style more 
<br>
marked, adding a reference number and &quot;:&quot; to each use.
<br>
<p>&quot;Po (1): ...&quot;
<br>
<p>Nobody played along. Hmm, let's see if I can pull off the &quot;hats&quot; thing.
<br>
<p>(Putting on red hat:)
<br>
Sadly(?), Anders is right. 
<br>
<p>Early adopters can sound like they're living in a wacky world of their own, inches away
<br>
from utter word salad. Especially in a totally open forum, onlookers will include people
<br>
who become disaffected and uncomfortable.
<br>
<p>(White hat:)
<br>
In order to get this sort of thing to work well, one needs to be in a secure corner 
<br>
among cooperative, disciplined (or at least properly habituated) people who evolve
<br>
and maintain a good protocol. Gee, flamebait for cult accusations. Oh well.
<br>
<p>(Black hat:)
<br>
For better or worse, the <a href="mailto:extropians@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20Posthuman%20Language&In-Reply-To=&lt;3C0328F0.D7E12158@comp-lib.org&gt;">extropians@extropy.org</a> of today is not such a place.
<br>
<p>(Green hat:)
<br>
For the best results, weird jargon talkers need to mark their mental/behavioral spaces so that
<br>
they can come back to earth when not talking to their fellows, and do so with grace, agility and
<br>
equanimity. Ralph Merkle did a pretty fine job on Art Bell recently.
