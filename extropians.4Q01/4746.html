<em>&gt; However, leaving aside the oil debate for a minute, I'll simply point

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the energy to the Earth from the moon do not appear to me to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;recommended&quot; solutions.  Why?  Because you are messing up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecological balance of the planet.  We know we could potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have on a habitable planet with the CO2 levels in the atmosphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several centuries ago (at least on multi-100-thousand year timescales).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We *don't* know if we have a planet which is habitable for the long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term with the current CO2 atmospheric levels *or* in a situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the Earth is receiving (and having to *radiate*) significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more energy than it currently absorbs from the sun [which is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens if you collect the energy on the moon and beam it to Earth].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So *unless* your energy plans include sprinkling white styrofoam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beads over much of the ocean's surface area or building cooling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towers into the stratosphere, I think you should consider that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fossil fuel based energy supply and off-planet harvested energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are really *bad* ideas.  And before you start suggesting &quot;engineered&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions (yea, I know you guys like to do this, just like me)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you better ask yourselves *how* good your computer models are and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the limits are on climate predictability due to chaos effects?
</em><br>
<p>Microwaves beamed in from elsewhere are less disruptive than any other
<br>
source of zero-entropy energy; heat engines on Earth's surface release
<br>
more waste heat than they produce electricity, and ground solar
<br>
dramatically lowers the albedo in the regions affected.  Rectennas can
<br>
have a neutral impact on global thermal balance if they are painted
<br>
white.
<br>
<p>Even the total US electrical power demand is less than a terawatt, or
<br>
about equal to the sunlight on a disk 30 km across.  Given that roadways
<br>
in the US are more than 2.5 million miles (and assuming an average 30
<br>
foot width), their total area is about 5 times greater than this
<br>
notional disk.  Most roads are much darker than the natural surface, so
<br>
if their albedo is more than 20% lower than the original, they
<br>
contribute more heat to the planet than would beaming all electricity
<br>
down from space.  Making all roadways white while beaming power down
<br>
from space would actually cool the planet- no need to scatter trash on
<br>
the oceans.
