<p>&quot;Well, for starters, lets first scale everything to a progressive scale
<br>
like left wingers are so wont to do when it benefits their arguments:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel   Afghanistan   Egypt
<br>
%/capita GDP supplied by aid:  &lt;0.85%         &gt;1.5%     &lt;0.66%
<br>
<p>So it seems that the US was providing almost twice as much aid to the
<br>
Afghan people as to the people of Israel (note that more than 1/3 of the
<br>
citizenship of Israel are Muslim arabs). Don't you think that this
<br>
demonstrates a significant bias by the US AGAINST the Israeli people and
<br>
FOR the Afghan people?&quot;
<br>
<p>Mike, using progressive scale measurements is yet another cop out that the
<br>
1st world (most notable the USA) uses to justify the continuing poverty &amp;
<br>
unfair allocation of resources to 3rd world countries. The fact is that
<br>
people in countries like Afghanistan live in poverty and the foreign aid
<br>
that they receive only provides the barest minimum of advances. Regardless
<br>
of a country's GDP, major life enhancing projects like improving electrical
<br>
or telco infrastructure &amp; even real basics like clean water cost big bucks,
<br>
and it is countries with low GDP's (like Afghanistan) that need the most
<br>
help and the most money to make real improvements in the lives of their
<br>
citizens. Afghanistan in particular now needs real help from the USA - many
<br>
of the problems that Afghanistan faces are the direct result of US policy,
<br>
even prior to the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;, in fact in many respects one can see
<br>
the seeds of the economic, humanitarian, religious &amp; military situation in
<br>
Afghanistan in the foreign policy of the US, Pakistan &amp; the USSR, and it is
<br>
no great leap of intellect to see the same forces to be at least partly
<br>
responsible for the terrible acts of September 11. 
<br>
<p>If one thing is learnt from the attacks on the WT centre it should be this:
<br>
the 1st World*, and most especially the USA can no longer afford to pursue
<br>
foreign policy without regard to the effects such policy will have on the
<br>
people of other nations. The propping up of mad dictators &amp; inhumane juntas
<br>
MUST stop. The exploitation of foreign workers and ecologies for the profit
<br>
of a few rich shareholders MUST stop. The 1st world and the US in particular
<br>
MUST act responsibly, failure to do so generates the hatred, generates the
<br>
economic misery that lunatic organisations like Al Quada thrive upon. The
<br>
saddest thing of all, is that by acting responsibly on a global scale, and
<br>
improving the lives of lesser nations, America &amp; the 1st world* will
<br>
eventually benefit in many ways; economically through new markets &amp; the
<br>
development of new products, militarily by having other countries (&amp; most
<br>
importantly the populations of those countries) being better disposed
<br>
towards the 1st world, culturally by the infusion of new ideas, ecologically
<br>
by the adoption of cleaner &amp; more ecologically responsible technologies -
<br>
the list goes on. These are not short term benefits, and it will take a
<br>
strong government with a real commitment to take the world down this path.
<br>
It CAN be done if only we of the 1st world have the courage, if America
<br>
makes good on it's promise of being the &quot;land of the free&quot; &amp; the &quot;defender
<br>
of freedom&quot;. 
<br>
<p>*Please note that I do not exclude my country (Australia) from my criticism.
<br>
At present the Australian government, always the first to criticise other
<br>
countries for their failure to uphold basic human rights, is engaged in what
<br>
can only be called the politics of hatred, by demonising legitimate
<br>
political refugees (including going so far as to manufacture photographic
<br>
evidence) in order to illegally imprison them in sub standard housing, quite
<br>
literally in the middle of one of the harshest deserts in the world.
<br>
Australia currently treats refugees (including those from Afghanistan who
<br>
are fleeing the Taliban - the regime we are at war with!) infinitely worse
<br>
than it treats prisoners of war or even those who commit violent crimes like
<br>
rape &amp; murder. This illegal imprisonment (for some people the imprisonment
<br>
length could be indefinite) extends to women &amp; children, many of whom have
<br>
suffered from or witnessed murder &amp; torture. This, the treatment of
<br>
indigenous Australians and the ecological insanity of the current government
<br>
make my country no better than the US, or China or many other nations.
