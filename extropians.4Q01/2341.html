This is my review (from www.manyworlds.com) of the recent Red Herring 
<br>
article on the NanoBusiness Alliance report. I'm not posting the URL since 
<br>
Red Herring seems to be fiddling with their website, and all URLs are going 
<br>
to their new homepage.

<p>The View From Here
<br>
Red Herring by Stephan Herrera, published on 11/02/01
<br>
<p>With all the recent attention to nanotechnology and other technologies of 
<br>
the very small, some investors and entrepreneurs want to know how large is 
<br>
the market opportunity today and tomorrow. In a critical examination of a 
<br>
survey by the new NanoBusiness Aliance (NBA), Herrara finds that most of 
<br>
the funding and output is for companies working on MEMs and 
<br>
microtechnologies, not nanotech and NEMs. While their numbers differ, the 
<br>
NBA and the NSF both see the market for nanotech products growing 
<br>
enormously in the next few years into the hundreds of billions of dollars. 
<br>
The problem with the NBA's first survey (which they say they will correct 
<br>
next time) is that in surveying 150 companies they made no distinction 
<br>
between microtech and nanotech. This distinction is important because 
<br>
nanotech works at a scale one thousandth the size of microtechnology and 
<br>
potentially is far more powerful, with a wider range of applications. The 
<br>
figure of $1.2 billion for VC money going into nanotech is similarly 
<br>
flawed. The figure was derived not by asking VCs directly, but by asking 
<br>
the companies what they expected to receive for nanotech and microtech. 
<br>
More and more people agree that the business potential for nanotech is 
<br>
large. We can only hope that the next survey will provide more reliable 
<br>
numbers for those considering ventures in the realms of the very small.
