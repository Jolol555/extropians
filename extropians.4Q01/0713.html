<em>&gt;Subject: Cryonicist/NYPD officer killed due to WTC attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Wed, 10 Oct 2001 21:47:32 -0900
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On cryonet I learned about another life tragically snuffed out by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terrorist attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I looked with great interest at the photograph of cryonicist/fallen NYPD 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;officer, John Perry.  Most of the other officers had the hardened and gaunt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;look of someone doing law enforcement work in a very rough locale.  But, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;John had that really big, friendly, and confident smile on his face!  He 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really stood apart from the others.  I wish I had been able to meet this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;man.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/memorial_01.html">http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/memorial_01.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I found it fascinating that a libertarian who had practiced law earlier in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life, would decide to jump into such a tough, yet potentially rewarding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;line of work.  It makes me wonder what the other officers thought of him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I tend to think in another age John Perry would have perished trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;save people from a viciously attacked space colony.  As much as I hope we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will one day not need to call upon people to risk their lives, I hope we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never run out of brave men and women like John Perry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is a great article about the man:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.nandotimes.com/nation/story/124111p-1305964c.html">http://www.nandotimes.com/nation/story/124111p-1305964c.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sadly, I have learned he had dropped out of his contract with ALCOR.  But, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even if he had been signed up, it would have made no difference in the end 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;due to the nature of his death.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, then he wasn't really a cryonicist, was he? :-)
<br>
<p>It sounds as if he was another young, idealistic libertarian. Smart, 
<br>
educated person, no doubt.  I surprised Perry never joined the seminary.  
<br>
Libertarianism and humanism are really filling a void and a need that humans 
<br>
have, and which religion fills.
