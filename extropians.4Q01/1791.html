Humanoid robot runs on Linux power
<br>
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-7657781.html?tag=cd_mh">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1006-200-7657781.html?tag=cd_mh</a>
<br>
LONDON--Japanese scientists are planning to demonstrate a walking,
<br>
Linux-operated, humanoid robot next month in Europe.
<br>
<p>The two-legged H7 robot is around 54 inches tall and weighs 121 pounds. It has
<br>
36 joints--or &quot;degrees of freedom&quot;--which H7's developers claim means it has
<br>
full body motion. An onboard computer, built around two 750MHz Pentium III
<br>
processors, runs the RT-Linux operating system.
<br>
The appearance--at the Embedded Linux Expo from Nov. 26 to 29 in Milan,
<br>
Italy--will be the H7 robot's first visit to Europe. Researchers at the JSK
<br>
Laboratory in Japan created the robot and hope it will become a useful
<br>
platform for robotic developments--especially in the field of artificial
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>&quot;Human-shaped robots are well suited for operating within environments
<br>
designed for real humans,&quot; said Satoshi Kagami, a senior research scientist at
<br>
the Digital Human Laboratory of Tokyo's National Institute of Advanced Science
<br>
and Technology. Kagami added that H7 would &quot;provide an experimental research
<br>
platform for full-body integrated sensing and control.&quot;
<br>
<p>Video footage of H7 shows it is capable of walking unaided, both in a straight
<br>
line and in a crab-like shuffle. The robot contains batteries and can
<br>
communicate to a network via a wireless Ethernet connection.
<br>
<p>The team behind the H7 claims that the robot is fully self-contained and can
<br>
be operated without external cables. On the video footage released by JSK
<br>
Laboratories, H7 is connected to an external device--possibly a power
<br>
source--which one researcher pushes around on a trolley after H7.
<br>
<p>H7 is already equipped with collision-checking technology that allows it to
<br>
tell when it has walked into an obstacle. The scientists at JSK Laboratories
<br>
are already working on 3D vision functionality that could allow H7 to avoid
<br>
collisions altogether.
<br>
<p>The RT-Linux OS is designed for robotic applications, as well as data
<br>
acquisition and systems control functions. Fujitsu recently launched its own
<br>
RT-Linux robot, called Hoap-1. Fujitsu has released details of the internal
<br>
architecture of Hoap-1, to help researchers and enthusiasts to design powerful
<br>
applications for the robot.

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
