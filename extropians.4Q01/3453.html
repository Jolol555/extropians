<p>
<em>&gt; So? You are assuming that they will not be made public, to start with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, public trials are actually NOT the right of every person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have a right to a trial by a jury of your peers. There is nothing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the constitution that says that the trial has to be public as it occurs.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the term &quot;public trial&quot; IS in the consitution, and the
<br>
term &quot;jury of peers&quot; is not (it's from the Magna Carta).  I don't
<br>
personally like to use the Constitution to justify what I consider
<br>
right and wrong, but if you're going to use it, take a bit more
<br>
care with the quotes.  How you care to interpret &quot;public trial&quot; is
<br>
of course up to the discretion of various judges.
<br>
<p>We are assuming the tribunals will not be public because (1) the law
<br>
says they don't have to be, and (2) the last time they were used, they
<br>
were closed.  That seems like a reasonable assumption to me.  If they
<br>
want to do public tribunals, I would certainly prefer that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Indeed, it is often the prerogative of judges to seal a trial to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever extent they feel necessary. Trials must be a matter of public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; record, i.e. their proceedings must be made public at some time after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they occur, but, for instance, jury deliberations are not a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public record, nor are many settlements and plea bargains.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the words &quot;public trial&quot; are pretty vague, and judges do have a
<br>
bad habit of interpreting vague constitutional provisions to accomplish
<br>
whatever result they think it right at the time.  I personally think
<br>
it should have been clearer.  I _don't_ think judges should have
<br>
discretion on things like cameras, for instance.  Jury deliberations
<br>
I don't have a problem with, nor _civil_ monetary settlements.
<br>
Criminal plea bargains, though, should be public (as most are).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the circumstances, sealing trials of terrorists until the conflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is concluded, or for simply some time after trial to greatly reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence value of those public records, is a rational measure to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take. It is a bit extreme, but we are not dealing with citizens here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor are we dealing with anyone who would in any rational way accept OUR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posession of similar civil rights.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I see the vital national security concerns here.  What
<br>
information might come out at trial that wouldn't make the public even
<br>
safer, like people's affiliations and histories, the security lapses
<br>
they took advantage of, etc.?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Human/civil rights only exist de facto when all participating parties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree they do, regardless of their de theorem basis. If a murderer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't think you have a right to live, then he similarly loses his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to live. This is the basis of self defense. Similarly, the Taliban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and al Qaeda organizations have denied that human beings posess any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human rights outside the Sharia Law. Hold them to their own standard.
</em><br>
<p>We'll just have to disagree here.  If you don't try to live every moment
<br>
of your own life by your own standards, then what's the point of having
<br>
them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is so obviously the problem. Yet the problem with Lee's argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now is that he is insisting  that our trial system be inviolate, in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the principle of public trials be held sacrosanct, but he is perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to violate his own premise in changing jury selection rules,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules of evidence, and procedural details just so his concept will work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One more example of &quot;stealing the assumption&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>You have a reading comprehension problem, Mike.  I never said anything
<br>
even remotely resembling the idea that I supported the American trial
<br>
system as a whole, and I have been entirely consistent on that.  I meant
<br>
exactly, precisely, what I said in plain English, no more and no 
<br>
less.  I'll say it again so you can get it this time: I hold the principle
<br>
of PUBLIC TRIALS sacrosanct.  Whatever other principles you consider to
<br>
part of the American judicial system are fair game for reform--as long as
<br>
the trials thus created remain open to public scrutiny.  It's about
<br>
transparency, not whatever particulars some document mentions.  The
<br>
particulars can change with the circumstances, but the one, and only,
<br>
absolute inviolable principle is that trials be PUBLIC.
