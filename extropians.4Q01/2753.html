Brave New Brain: Conquering Mental Illness in the Era of the Genome
<br>
By Nancy C. Andreasen, M.D., Ph.D., Oxford University Press, 368pp, $65.00 
<br>
<p>Strong Imagination: Madness, Creativity and Human Nature
<br>
By Daniel Nettle, Oxford University Press, 235pp, $69.95
<br>
<p>Reviewed by Damien Broderick
<br>
<p><p>A few years ago I sat down late one evening in front of the telly with a
<br>
cuppa and a slice of cake, and out of the blue my pulse accelerated madly.
<br>
What the--? My heart hammered; awful dread flooded me. I lay flat on the
<br>
floor and took my pulse, gazing up blurrily at the wall clock. Over 110 a
<br>
minute. I'm a skinny character, in pretty good nick. While I hadn't lifted
<br>
weights for a while, I walk a lot, don't smoke, eat and drink moderately.
<br>
It seemed possible that I was, well, dying.
<br>
<p>Alone in the house, I literally crawled to the phone and rang my brother
<br>
the medico. Every family should have one. `You're hyperventilating,' he
<br>
told me calmly. `Breathe into a paper bag.' That would elevate my carbon
<br>
dioxide levels to slow my respiration, I knew, but I gasped that it was my
<br>
runaway heart, not my lungs, that bothered me. `You're having a panic
<br>
attack, nothing to worry about,' he assured me. Unconvinced, my body and
<br>
mind droned with doom.
<br>
<p>I was wired up for 24 hours with a pulse tracker, had an echocardiogram.
<br>
Nothing physically amiss. All in the head, as they say. It recurred a
<br>
couple of times later, at the most inconvenient times (twice in restaurants
<br>
with dear friends), along with that terrifying, overpowering sense of fatal
<br>
dread. Part of the condition, they told me. Transmitter chemicals get out
<br>
of whack in the brain, triggered by stress hormones, and upset the organic
<br>
pacemaker that regulates heart beat. What had caused it? I realised
<br>
(ironically, given the work I do) that the first episode was a delayed and
<br>
unvoiced rage reaction to an especially mean-spirited and unfair review of
<br>
one of my books I'd read earlier in the day.
<br>
<p>Dr Nancy Andreasen need fear no such reaction if she chances upon this
<br>
review. I recommend her book to anyone intrigued by the enormous changes
<br>
that science and technology are making to our understanding of the mind, in
<br>
health and illness. That's not to say her book is flawless; she's an
<br>
experimental neuroscientist and psychiatrist, not a professional writer, so
<br>
some of her book reminds me of those corny Reader's Digest medical
<br>
articles: `I am Joe's Liver'. Parts of Brave New Brain (itself a less than
<br>
happy title for a book extolling technical advances) turn into `I am
<br>
Joanna's Anterior Cingulate Sulcus', or tell little parables about anxious
<br>
Michelle or `mellow Melissa', or lurch into textbookese: `Dopamine, a
<br>
catecholamine neurotransmitter, is the first product synthesized from
<br>
tyrosine through the enzymatic activity of tyrosine hydroxylase'. These
<br>
glitches are forgivable, I think, in such a rich and mostly accessible
<br>
display of neuroscience's remarkable new treasure house.
<br>
<p>Andreasen is a well-credentialed guide for the tour. As chair of psychiatry
<br>
at Iowa University, she's been a key player developing those new imaging
<br>
techniques that show us the inner workings of the living brain, down to
<br>
sub-millimetre resolution, without opening the hood. Her early medical work
<br>
with profoundly traumatised burns patients made her the ideal choice, as
<br>
the Vietnam war wound down, to revive and advocate the more general topic
<br>
of post-traumatic stress disorder, a term she devised for DSM III, the
<br>
1970s' psychiatric bible. Drawing on her recent imaging work, she's
<br>
developed a model of schizophrenia as an explicit brain disorder, marked by
<br>
`misconnection syndrome', a series of physical disruptions in the growing
<br>
brain. Last year she was one of just twelve US scientists to receive the
<br>
President's Medal.
<br>
<p>Starting from basics, her book lays out the key information needed to make
<br>
sense of later detailed accounts of how scanning and genome advances
<br>
clarify what goes wrong in the brains and experience of people suffering
<br>
schizophrenia, emotional or mood disorders, the dementias of old age, and
<br>
those anxiety states of the kind that clobbered me. Inevitably, much of
<br>
this opening background has a homework flavour, so I'd recommend diving
<br>
straight into chapter six, where the astonishing tale of neuro-imaging is
<br>
told--explaining lucidly how PET scans and functional magnetic resonance
<br>
(fMR) images catch the living brain in mid thought, tracking which bits do
<br>
what. 
<br>
<p>You can watch as unpleasant pictures and thoughts activate the deep,
<br>
ancient limbic system, while joyful ideas light up the distinctively human
<br>
cortex. It's encouraging. So too is the prospect that ever more nuanced
<br>
non-invasive probes will show us the workings and defects of what is
<br>
misleadingly dubbed `the human heart'--now relocated into that most
<br>
mysterious and complex of organs, the brain.
<br>
<p>But is all this too `reductionistic', too dismissive of those stigmatised
<br>
as `mentally ill''? In the '60s and '70s, madness was briefly glorified.
<br>
Psychotics were allegedly victims of malign family dynamics but also heroes
<br>
of the revolution against throttling orthodoxies. The bankruptcy of such
<br>
romantic posturing (I fell for it myself) was revealed by the rise of new
<br>
medicines and scanners, and by the suffering it had wrought on the ill and
<br>
those nearest to them. 
<br>
<p>Anthropologist Daniel Nettle revives a similar topic, proposing that `the
<br>
more extreme positions on the spectrum of mental life are… typical not just
<br>
of malfunction--mental illness--but of the best in mental
<br>
functioning--inspiration and creativity.' He cogently explores this link
<br>
between `the lunatic, the lover and the poet', while recognising that
<br>
madness, even manic madness, is no fun: `never forget for a moment that the
<br>
psychoses are severe, crippling, often lethal diseases'. Serotonin and
<br>
dopamine systems, he concludes, make us who we are, yet they are not our
<br>
choice but the parental gift of our genes. Luckily, genes are not the whole
<br>
of destiny, and madness is indeed in some respects the far side of
<br>
Shakespearean flourishing. Art as well as panic can make our pulse race,
<br>
and so can love.
