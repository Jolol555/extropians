<em>&gt; This reminds me of a passage from the Illuminatus! Trilogy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Well, I was young and ignorant of everything outside ten million books
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd gobbled and guilty-unsure about my imaginative flights away from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; father's realism and of course stoned of course but I finally understood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why he was watching me that way, it was (this part of it) pure Zen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there was nothing I could do consciously or by volition that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfy him and I had to do exactly that which I could not not do,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; namely be Simon Moon.  Which led to deciding then and there without any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to mull it over and rationalize it just what the hell being Simon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moon or, more precisely SimonMooning, consisted of, and it seemed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a matter of wandering through room after room of my brain looking for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the owner and not finding him anywhere, sweat broke out on my forehead,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was becoming desperate because I was running out of rooms and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Padre was still watching me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;Nobody home,&quot; I said finally, sure that the answer wasn't good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;That's odd,&quot; he said.  &quot;Who's conducting the search?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>That's easy. The brain named &quot;Simon Moon&quot; was conducting the search, and the
<br>
brain correctly concluded that the phantom host did not exist. (The Padre was
<br>
a deluded brain.)
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
