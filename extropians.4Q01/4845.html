I picked up this newspaper on my return to Europe a couple of
<br>
weeks ago. Please tell me (yes or no) if you are shocked.

<br>
<p>Silicon Valley's next boom could be profitably patriotic
<br>
<p>The Valley's next economic engines will be biotechnolgy and
<br>
nanotechnology -- engineering at a molecular level. So says a new
<br>
report by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley.
<br>
<p>Long-term, that's true. But the region's most immediate opportunity
<br>
may lie in solving America's pressing challenges, bioterrorism and
<br>
cyberterrorism. As a result of Sept. 11 and anthrax attacks, the
<br>
federal government is pouring money into homeland protection, and
<br>
ocmpanies are reordering their priorities.
<br>
<p>Computer security is the one area that's getting a big boost in
<br>
corporate information technology budgets. Congress has approved $40
<br>
billion for domestic defense capabilities, and more is coming.
<br>
<p>Richard Clarke, President Bush's cybersecurity adviser, said the
<br>
Office of Management and Budget, the government's budget hawk, will
<br>
take to task departments that don't spend *more* on computer
<br>
security. Last week two House leaders proposed the $7.5 billion
<br>
Cyber Security Research and Development Act. It would funnel money
<br>
to agencies like NASA for security research, and to universities and
<br>
community colleges to promote technology careers. One obvious use:
<br>
courses for laid-off engineers and dot-com workers looking to shift
<br>
careers.
<br>
<p>What these and other developments hold for the valley will be the
<br>
focus of a one-day conference, the Technology and Homeland Security
<br>
Summit and Expo, on Thursday in San Jose. San Jose Silicon Valley
<br>
Workforce Investment Network, a federally funded job placement
<br>
agency, is organizing the even. The Mercury News is a sponsor.
<br>
<p>Matching the employment needs of companies with the workforce is one
<br>
theme. Government procurement is another. Some Silicon Valley
<br>
companies are eager to enlist in the war against terrorism, with its
<br>
double appeal of patriotism and profits. But, sensing a clash of
<br>
cultures, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs traditionally have kept a
<br>
distance from government, and many wouldn't have the faintest idea
<br>
how to navigate labryinthine federal bureaucracies.
<br>
<p>It's smart to bring companies together to share war stories, show
<br>
off products, and learn from each other. Washington and the Valley
<br>
share a common interest in putting new technologies to use as fast
<br>
as possible.
