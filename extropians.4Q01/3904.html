<p>Actually, insects are probably a poor example since they branched off

from the vertebrate tree so early.  Its safe to say that we probably
<br>
have most of the genes involved in aspects of vertebrate development
<br>
(perhaps for tails for example).  But any gene sequences for a form
<br>
contained within a unique branch of the tree (e.g. tusk formation)
<br>
is unlikely to be present in other species.

</em><br>
<p>As often as species go extinct (or evolve significantly).  I was
<br>
primarily focused on all the unique adaptations that get lost
<br>
when this happens.  The entire natural selection process is
<br>
ruthless.  For example genes for larger size will generally
<br>
get selected for until you hit the carrying capacity of the
<br>
environment.  Then genes for smaller size will get selected
<br>
every year you have a drought or some other food resource
<br>
depleting event.  Perhaps the entire reason that two chromosomes
<br>
pairs were chosen as carriers to allow Nature to do some
<br>
&quot;memory&quot; of workable strategies.  E.g. If your population
<br>
has two size alleles, B and b, then your population will
<br>
generally consist of bb Bb bB BB.  BB's have the advantage
<br>
during times of plenty and bb's in times of famine.  Much
<br>
of the rest of the time the Bb's simply serve as the
<br>
reservoir to carry the different alleles allowing the
<br>
population to survive famines and fluorish in times
<br>
of plenty.
<br>
<p>But you can easily see how it might be advantageous to design
<br>
more chromosomes (redundancy) and greater numbers of alleles
<br>
into a population so it has more flexibility.  Nature developed
<br>
a system that is &quot;good enough&quot; but nowhere near the limits.
