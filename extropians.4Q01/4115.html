<em>&gt; Um, because some of us don't confuse words with violence.
</em><br>
<p>Violence is violence.  Actions and words grow out of thoughts
<br>
belittling the others person rather than dealing with the ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Terms like &quot;verbal abuse&quot; beg the question of whether there

<p>Er, I grew up with a father who practice extremes of verbal
<br>
abuse on his children almost every single day.  I know from
<br>
first hand experience that such strictly verbal behavior hurts
<br>
people and hurts just as deeply at times as any level of
<br>
physical abuse (which was also not unknown in the household). 
<br>
In any case there is no place for verbal harrassment of the
<br>
person one is talking to in a rational discussion.

<p>If you wish to ignore that words can hurt people and that they

have no place in a civilized discussion, exactly how is that &quot;my

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; concede that there might be such a thing, its existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and definitions are necessarily vague and subjective.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man's abuse is another man's humor.  It is disingenuous to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>I think using your fine brain to disown the negative side of
<br>
certain types of verbal exchange is disingenyous.
