<p><em>&gt;Actually, I very much doubt this last as many of the Afghanis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are now at the point of ruining their stomachs eating grass they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are so hungry.  The truth is that not nearly enough food is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;available to prevent the deaths of millions.  And no, it is not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or not just, the fault of the Taliban.  The country has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ravaged by war and various repressive regimes for 3 decades. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Its agricultural and economic understructure is a total shambles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and was even before the bombing.  The vast majority of food aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used to come by truck convoy from Pakistan.  We stopped those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;convoys on or around September 16.  The food packets we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dropped have been only a drop in the bucket of what is needed if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;millions are to avoid death by starvation, malnutrion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunistic disorders as a result of that and/or exposure.   
</em><br>
<p><p>I watched this morning on the news as barges loaded with hundreds
<br>
of tons of food moved into northern Afghanistan today, the first of
<br>
many.
<br>
<p>The Northern Alliance now control Kabul and there are reports of
<br>
the Taliban fleeing Kandahar.
<br>
<p>A network of more than 200 caves just north of Kabul has been
<br>
surrounded by Northern Alliance and U.S. Special Forces who are
<br>
systematically searching them.
<br>
<p>Barber shops in Mazer-E-Sharif are reported doing a booming
<br>
business as men shave off their beards and reports that women have
<br>
abandoned the burka. There is music playing in the streets.
<br>
<p>So much for doom-and-gloom prophecies.
