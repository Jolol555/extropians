This is the 3rd part of my response - I am sorry for this balloning of text
<br>
<p><p>-------
<br>
<em>&gt; resource in the hands of a few percent of the population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has occurred many times here on Earth. What starts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a relatively non-coercive system (neolithic farmers easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switching to a hunter-gatherer existence) becomes a slave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or feudal state. You can name Rome, England, Russia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; France, Latin America and many others as examples.
</em><br>
<p>Which of these examples started off relatively noncoercively and when?
<br>
<p>### See examples above (Native....etc, recently, last 5 000 to 500 years
<br>
ago,  and Europe, many thousands of years ago).
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>Latin America, e.g., started off with the Spanish and Portugese empires
<br>
and though most of it is now democratic states, the basic social system
<br>
leaves much of the imperial systems locked in.  Recall the de Soto book
<br>
discussed many weeks ago?  One of his main complaints is that voluntary
<br>
systems in Latin America -- the &quot;informal economy&quot; -- is still largely
<br>
illegal.  Legalizing it would allow people to do their own thing --
<br>
still no correcting all of history, but letting them get on with
<br>
bettering themselves through longer range planning, wealth accumulation,
<br>
and trade.
<br>
<p>### But with no money and no land, your voluntary activities are limited.
<br>
Why should the landowners allow competition if they can get away with
<br>
suppressing it? Their situation is not an argument against government per
<br>
se, but against government as it is now. No surprise armed uprisings occur
<br>
so frequently.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Only revolutions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical developments break such states, forcing some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redistribution of inherited wealth, as opposed to earned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly true.  Social changes apart from technology often play a big
<br>
role -- and technology is only one factor among many.  Let's no reify
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>### Not exactly, but *mostly* true (or else - can you substantiate the claim
<br>
that, historically, non-technology driven, voluntary activities led to the
<br>
decline of most feudal states?)
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; (a very important distinction - I am in favor of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherited wealth redistribution but largely against redistribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of earned wealth),
</em><br>
<p>If people earn their wealth, by your lights, can they generally do what
<br>
they want with it?  If so, then why can't they give it to their heirs --
<br>
whoever they choose these to be?
<br>
<p>### No, they can't do what they want. E.g. they may not hire private armies
<br>
to fight private wars (as in XVI century Poland, not long before that
<br>
state's collapse), or build family estates rivaling the state in the ability
<br>
to coerce poorer citizens.
<br>
<p><pre>
----
<p><p>&gt; and allowing the
&gt; formation of a democracy, which is likely to be the first political
&gt; system refraining from beheading thinkers opposing it.
<p>Like France during the Reign of Terror.  Democracy in action!  Also,
democracies and republics tend to be the bloodies in warfare.  We have
only to look at the American Civil War, both World Wars, and US warfare
from the Persian Gulf War to today.  Some of this is, no doubt, due to
advancing technology, but part of it is also due to the concept of total
war.  When democracies fight they generally see the whole other society
as the enemy -- not just its rulers or military.
<p>### So what is better - a feudal system, or a democracy (on average)? What
percentage of young men in a mature democracy are killed in wars started by
the democracy, as compared to kill ratios in feudal or slave states, and the
ungoverned tribal societies?
<p>----
<p>&gt; So this is my example - unregulated land market in an agrarian
&gt; society will result in the destruction of freedom, virtual abolition
&gt; of the market and a coercive intervention is warranted to prevent
&gt; this from happening. Of course, merely killing the rich is a bad
&gt; idea - those who do the killing soon get rich, too, until the next
&gt; peasant revolt.
<p>I don't think this will be the outcome for the above state reasons.
This scenario has never played itself out without coercion involved at
every step.
<p>### It did again and again - with coercion spontaneously developing as the
main modality for social control, only much later mellowing to the level of
modern US.
<p>----- 
<p>Note also what you're implying: we need to give up freedom to protect
freedom.
<p>### The only truly socially free man would be a lonely man. As with
investing money, so it is with freedom that you have to prudently give away
some, to get more in return. With the emphasis on &quot;prudently&quot;.
<p>----- 
<p>&gt; Instituting progressive land taxation is an option,
<p>Actually, that would lead to economic ineffiency by not permitting
certain voluntary arrangements. 
<p>### It would stop exactly the voluntary arrangements which if unchecked,
result in the above scenario.
----
<p> Also, the tax money itself will be
wasted on something the taxed did not want, further distorting the
economy.
<p>### The (land magnates) taxed here want to rule the world - it's good to
keep the economy free and efficient by stopping them.
<p>----
<p>  Finally, an agency strong enough to enforce it would be a
threat to the society it existed in.  There would be no reason to think
its power would be limited to just keep your model going.
<p>### Yes, here we agree - a government is a very dangerous beast. Every
citizen has to be aware of the danger, and with stupid or immoral citizens
(=willing to use the government to get a bigger slice of a smaller pie),
results are bad.
<p>-----
<p>&gt; thus protecting
&gt; the smaller economic units although in the long run the
&gt; development of a technical economy is even better,
<p>But you haven't shown why this wouldn't happen spontaneously.  After
all, most people want better choices and those who can give them to them
often make a nice profit.  Why would not this dynamic provide?
<p>### Why, you haven't described in detail (and with historical examples) how
the spontaneous process would happen.
<p>-----
&gt; allowing relaxation of controls on
&gt; land ownership (if land stops being an important source of wealth,
&gt; oligopoly control is no longer an obstacle to development). By the
&gt; way, I am againt subsidizing small (or any other) farms, the way it's
&gt; done in Europe and to a lesser extent in the US.
<p>So am I.  However, I'm generally against all coercive interventions in
society, from subsidizing small farms to taxing big ones to stealing
inherited wealth.  I also don't see how a government is somehow better.
That just institutionalizes coercion with no guarantee the government
won't just grow and grow and grow.
<p><p>### As I said above, I am scared and distrustful of government, too, but I
do believe that the alternatives (barring some very special new
technological advances) are worse. And there is one guarantee against the
jackbooted gov't thugs - a smart and ethical citizenry. The only basis for
coercion is the need to protect innocent life-wish, protect truth, and
protect freedom - all of these are code phrases for very complex memes,
which I would be happy to discuss, if you wish.
