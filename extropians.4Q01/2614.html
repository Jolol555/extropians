<em>&gt; Next question, do the Italians spontaneously dance, like the Greeks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express the range of emotions (full of life--full of sorrow)?
</em><br>
<p>--------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Let us talk about Sardinia. 
<br>
<p>First of all, have you ever liisten to sardinian &quot;tenores&quot;? 
<br>

<br>
It's well worth listening! 
<br>
<p>Do you know the songs of Maria Carta?

<br>
This ***extraordinary*** voice is litlle-known outside Sardinia.
<br>
<p>Dancing is one of the two interesting aspects of Sardinia (the other is the sea).
<br>
The antiquity of dancing is proved by considerable elements,
<br>
i.e. the &quot;launeddas&quot;, the original instruments with which dances are 
<br>
still accompanied (VIII - VII b.C.). 
<br>
What is difficult to establish is if these dances, in their original forms,
<br>
have been guided, earlier, by the instrument (launeddas) or by the human 
<br>
voice. Moreover it is sure that the accompaniment of voices (tenores) 
<br>
arrived only later.
<br>
The sardinian dances are not indeed only occasion of purely amusement, 
<br>
but they are direct expression of *instincts* and *emotions*.
<br>
The main characteristic of the sardinian dance is the *composure* [not very
<br>
italian] that every single dancer has to put on, and the *serious* attitude.
<br>
It is no easy to describe the basic movement of the body in the sardinian 
<br>
dances. It is a particular rhythmical support in which the trunk participates 
<br>
and it is called &quot;drinnire&quot;.
<br>
Summing up. Yes, sardinan dances have something to do with Zorba the Greek.
<br>
Buth the rhythm is *much* faster.
<br>
<p>&quot;Su Passu Torra[t]u&quot; [the returned step], dance typical of the city of Nuoro,
<br>
and Orgosolo. It is composed by forwards and backwards steps, 
<br>
precisely &quot;returned&quot;. Main characteristic is the composure and seriousness 
<br>
of this dance. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Su Dillu&quot;
<br>
The name is probably onomatopoeic owed to the words with which 
<br>
the dance was accompanied: &quot;dilliri, dilliri, dilliriana&quot;. It is based on 
<br>
a single jumped movement that consists in two jumps on the right leg 
<br>
and two on the left.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sa Danza&quot;
<br>
Two are the principal movements: the basic step composed by two jumps 
<br>
on the right leg rejoining with a supported bow on the left leg and the lateral 
<br>
gallop on the left on the right.
<br>
<p>&quot;Su Ballu Anticu&quot;
<br>
It was danced in squares during village parties, involving people of every 
<br>
age and social class.
<br>
<p>&quot;Su Ballu Tundu&quot; 
<br>
It is a cheerful dance which permits a kind of feet movements freedom, 
<br>
always respecting the basic rules, moreover because this dance is carried 
<br>
out by couples and dancers express a personal level using their personality 
<br>
and inspiration. It is characterized by two basic movements: &quot;sa seria&quot;(introductory 
<br>
part) and &quot;su sartiu&quot; a more lively and vibrating part.
<br>
<p>&quot;Su durdurinu&quot;, in Oliena
<br>
&quot;Su ballu a cantiguittiri&quot;, ?
<br>
&quot;Su passu torratu bitti&quot;, ?
<br>
&quot;Su ballu de is muccadoris&quot;, in Elmas
<br>
&quot;S' arroxiada Samugheo&quot;, ?
<br>
&quot;Su ballu sciampittau&quot;, in Elmas.
