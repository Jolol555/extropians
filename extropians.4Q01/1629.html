<em>&gt; It seems to me that there's an improper linkage here; people who argue

<em>&gt; the artist feel obliged to argue that the age of downloading is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporary effect of improperly encrypted media.  These two issues are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely orthogonal - if the age of downloading is bad, we might want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do something about it, thus reducing the probability of the age of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downloading continuing - but the two issues are orthogonal to a much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater extent than the correlation of presented arguments would seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The age of downloading is unquestionably good - the real
<br>
question is how to claim the good in it maximally and as
<br>
equitably as possible. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that the age of downloading will probably reduce the total amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of money that goes to artists, and will certainly produce at least a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporary reduction in quality until a new generation of topnotch artists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to work for free arrives to replace the current cream of the crop,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have grown up expecting payment.  But I also think that the age of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downloading has enormously powerful forces behind it, verging on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitability.  Music as material good, as tape or record, is dead.  Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's an informational good and can be copied.  I don't know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information wants to be free, but information certainly wants to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downloaded.  In the new world, people who want information download that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information.  If prices are set too high, they will download without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That there is not a normal distribution system like today does
<br>
not necessarily mean that there is no way the artists will be
<br>
paid of course.  I think that without the middlemen and physical
<br>
media costs it will be much easier to come up with a way of
<br>
paying more artists much more equitably than they are actually
<br>
paid today while keeping the costs to download extremely low.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Information wants to be downloaded.  How much to pay for downloaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, or even whether to pay at all, is a choice that has shifted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the provider to the consumer.  If tipping infrastructures can break
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stranglehold of the current power structure, then the choice of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much to pay the middleman will shift from the middleman to the artist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The latter effect will reduce the amount paid to middlemen - and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former effect will reduce the total amount paid to artists, at least on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per-work basis; even if people are willing to spend the same total amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as before, cheap artists and free artists will still tend to drive out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive artists.
</em><br>
<p>In a digital age the need for middlemen quickly shrinks to
<br>
perhaps total disappearance.  Which is why the middlemen fear
<br>
this age the most and do the most to cripple it.  Today, in the
<br>
music business, almost all the money goes to the middlemen and
<br>
precious little, generally speaking, to the artists.  
<br>
<p>Personally, I think the entire economic framework is in the way
<br>
of where the digital age needs to go for all of us to maximally
<br>
benefit.  But that is another post.
