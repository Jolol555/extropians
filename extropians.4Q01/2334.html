I'd be rather surprised if this scenario were to pan out. When considering
<br>
the far longer lifespans which begin to make &quot;rare&quot; accidents more
<br>
problematic, the context is unlikely to include a biological body which is
<br>
similar to that we have today. At some point in the future I imagine that we
<br>
will find our biological bodies are just too hard to work with, with far too
<br>
many drawbacks, especially considering the alternatives that should arise.

<em>&gt; &quot;In just four years, and with $50 million, the Pentagon plans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wearable, self-propelled robotic suit that responds to - and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amplifies -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your every movement. By simply strapping themselves into this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;exoskeleton&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops will be able to run faster, jump higher, leap further,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just wanted to make some comments about this concept.  I have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigating something similiar for quite sometime and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications of such a 'suit' whether external or internal, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are important to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider.  Mainly, since most of us on this list would like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see aging and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disease defeated and be physiological immortal, a whole new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realm of things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will then become the enemy of lives, namely accidents.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wearing a protective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suit would thus radically minimize the chance of death caused 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by accidental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; injury.  In our meager short lives we dont much consider the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by falling rocks, car accidents, or even asteroid impacts.  A powered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; armored suit that also contains an environmental sealed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (think SCUBA dry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suits combined with powered armored exoskeletons) and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human biosphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just radically increased, from the surface of mars to deep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sea excursions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beings who do not age will have much vaster things to worry 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about that may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill them, stellar events, very rare accidents, etc. etc.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anything that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decreases those chances increases the life span of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the far future, most beings will have these suits of some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort and stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside of them most of the time.  They need not be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncomfortable either, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can easily emulate tactile sensations and the full range of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movement.  Be interesting to see where this goes once immortality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism start to tug at it.

<em>&gt; To be a member of the US Special Forces you need to be a crack soldier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with superior physical and mental abilities. But that's today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tomorrow's soldier will have to be superhuman - to be able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jog along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effortlessly at 13 kilometres per hour carrying a 70-kilogram load for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12 hours at a stretch. For anyone wearing the right clothes, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this shouldn't prove too much of a problem. In just four 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, and with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $50 million, the Pentagon plans to create a wearable, self-propelled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robotic suit that responds to - and amplifies - your every 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movement. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply strapping themselves into this &quot;exoskeleton&quot;, troops 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to run faster, jump higher, leap further, and carry awesome amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-calibre weaponry. We take a look at the &quot;garment&quot; that as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turning your average GI into a heavyweight fighting machine, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolutionise the lives of disabled people and those working as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firefighters or in construction, mining and heavy industries.

<em>&gt; Read the full feature in New Scientist magazine

<em>&gt; AND FINALLY...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some describe how a wave of sympathy washes over them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whenever they see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a road sign referring to a &quot;depressed bridge&quot;. Others confess 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel strangely moved by the mere mention of an &quot;alarmed door&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;nervous tissue&quot;. These people are suffering from semiopathy. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; week's Feedback column examines a debilitating condition which compels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its victims to over-empathise with objects...
