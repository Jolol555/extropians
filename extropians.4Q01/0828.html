<br>
<p>Okay, you've heard anthrax stories ad nauseaum by now. But what's odd
<br>
about them is that some of the suspicious packages are duds and some
<br>
aren't, sometimes sent to the same target and from the same putative
<br>
source. Why?
<br>
<p>Because, a dud shuts down the target and causes panic as much real
<br>
payload until the local health officials can test it. Furthermore,
<br>
repeated duds may use the boy-who-cried-wolf effect to soften up the
<br>
target for the real deal. They are maximizing the bang for their
<br>
buck. The only way I can think of resisting this tactic is to be ever
<br>
vigilant, and have fast, efficient plans in place for evacuating areas
<br>
and testing for anthrax.
<br>
<p>That and/or they've come up with a way to fool the health inspectors,
<br>
and all those 'negative' packages actually aren't. Anybody know how
<br>
they test for anthrax? I'm guessing antibody staining, and depending
<br>
on what the antibodies are specific for, it may be possible to evade
<br>
them by deliberately altering some non-crucial amino acid sequences.
<br>
<p>There is also the disturbing possibility that these letters were
<br>
stuffed chock full of spores which then distributed themselves all
<br>
over the random letters they were in transit with. If the post office
<br>
randomly sampled mail for a week or so, it may settle the question.
<br>
<p>Finally, maybe anthrax is a scary-sounding but ineffectual way to
<br>
terrorize people and this is either an experiment on their part or
<br>
a diversionary tactic.
<br>
<p>Ah, cavemen bioterrorists. Who needs the Sci-Fi channel when you've
<br>
got CNN?
