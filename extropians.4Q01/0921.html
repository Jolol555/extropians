<p>
<em>&gt; &gt;but its all semantics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is one of those cant phrases that genuinely infuriate me, and should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upset anyone with an educated brain in their head.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Semantics* is the discipline centrally concerned with *the meaning of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements*, with *how communication works effectively to convey or mask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meanings*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So `Pah, it's just semantics,' with its implied rider `Please ditch *that*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pettifogging triviality', is equivalent to saying, `That's just trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree on what we're talking about, and the ways we'll do it--let's ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such dismal irrelevancies and instead just babble about whatever comes into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our heads.'
</em><br>
<p>Most of the time I see the phrase used it's entirely appropriate--it
<br>
points out that someone is wasting a lot of time and energy on definitions
<br>
rather than arguments of substance, the way this list periodically gets
<br>
all worked up about the transporter-copy issue, where there isn't a single
<br>
interesting question of fact invovled.  Sure, one must have some
<br>
definitions to begin an argument of substance, but many people continue
<br>
to _argue_ the definitions as if they were facts of substance
<br>
themselves.  Knowing the difference should be a basic skill of
<br>
rational thought learned in elementary school, but people still continue
<br>
to debate definitions as if they were facts, and get truly worked up
<br>
about such nonsense.  If they are dismissed curty, it's because they
<br>
deserve to be.
