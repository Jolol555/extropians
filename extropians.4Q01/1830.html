<br>
<p>Where it comes to civil liberties, perhaps our Acchiles Heel is this:
<br>
<p>The Constitution was written in a time that more closely approximated
<br>
bricks-n-mortar classical capitalism. There was no such thing as a
<br>
multinational corporation. The only rapacious supra-human entities
<br>
they had to worry about were religons and governments. And they came
<br>
up with some solid, elegant, well thought out ways to protect humans
<br>
from both.
<br>
<p>When businesses started getting big, they managed to get themselves
<br>
treated as quasi-people rather than quasi-governments (the legal
<br>
precedent of corporate personhood). Oops. It wouldn't have been so bad
<br>
if the Constitution has prescribed guidelines on how individuals may
<br>
behave toward each other, which would therefore apply to these
<br>
corporation-people. But it doesn't-- the Constitution only applies to
<br>
what the Federal government can and can't do. Perhaps this was
<br>
deliberately to limit the power of the Constitution itself. Or
<br>
ironically, perhaps a subtle, lingering statist bias made the Framers
<br>
focus their attention on the government and completely ignore
<br>
individual conduct.
<br>
<p>But for whatever reason, there is no actual Constitutional reason an
<br>
individual can't go out and enslave, rob, or maim another individual.
<br>
In a bricks-n-mortar world, this was less of a problem, because there
<br>
was a practical limit to the coercive force one individual could bring
<br>
to bear on another... and the 'home court advantage' that underlies
<br>
our sense of rights and property was usually enough to deter all but
<br>
the most determined assaults. The latter could be resolved by the
<br>
judicial and executive branches of government as they arose. The
<br>
system wasn't foolproof, as slavery and disenfranchisement of women
<br>
demonstrated-- if a type of aggression is sufficiently widespread and
<br>
entrenched, the defender's advantage against the aggressor evaporates.
<br>
<p>Such cases have become the norm rather than the exception, perhaps
<br>
explaining the litigious turn our culture has taken. There are now
<br>
thousands of corporate pseudo-persons running loose that have SO much
<br>
more power than individuals that they can exercise de facto tyrannical
<br>
control over them through the mere threat of firing, lawsuit, and
<br>
outright coercion. Since the rules governing how they can treat you
<br>
are legislative rather than Constitutional, they are easier to
<br>
change. You have one vote. Time-Warner/AOL has many millions. Which
<br>
type of entity will most likely influence the legislation in its
<br>
favor?
<br>
<p>Perhaps basement nanofactories will solve this. But only if a
<br>
collusion of government and oligopolists doesn't get to pre-emptively
<br>
dictate the terms under which they are manufactured and used.
<br>

<br>
