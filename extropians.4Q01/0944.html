From: &quot;Pat Fallon&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:pfallon@ptd.net?Subject=Re:%20Anthrax%20addendum.&In-Reply-To=&lt;032701c155c6$43872360$6a5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">pfallon@ptd.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; No.  Nor do I think a group of twenty fanatics decided to get on board some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airliners, hijack them, and ram the WTC and the Pentagon because we are &quot;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shining beacon of freedom&quot; as Bush said.
</em><br>
<p>Bush was referring to the freedom enjoyed in the US compared to the repression
<br>
of the Taliban and similar regimes (obviously). The religious fanatic
<br>
hijackers did what they did because they were sick -- infected by the brain
<br>
disease called religion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To take one past example, the US helped replace the popularly supported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prime Minister of Iran, installed and propped up a dictator, the Shah, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ruled Iran with an iron fist for 25 years. When he was finally overthrown,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iranians stormed the US embassy and took hostages. They hated the US for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we had done to them. Not because we are a shining beacon of freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They didn't take hostages or storm the embassys of other countries. Why?
</em><br>
<p>Some Iranians hate the US (but not all Iranians do so). Similarly, some
<br>
Germans hated the US for what we had done to them in the 1940s (even though
<br>
they asked for it, and deserved what they got). Some Japanese hated the US for
<br>
what we had done to them in the 1940s (even though they asked for it, and
<br>
deserved what they got). The Iranians, like the Germans and the Japanese, will
<br>
probably come around in due course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The motives arn't hidden, just unmentioned in most of the hysterical media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commentary. IMHO America should practice free trade with all, and entangling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alliances with none. We should get out of the business of creating and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propping up monarchies, micomanaging world affairs with military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interventions and embargoes. If an oil company wants to business with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sultan and later finds their investments threatened with nationalization or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seizure, that is the price of doing business with such people, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price should be reflected in the cost of that oil, so we can all make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational choices.
</em><br>
<p>We can't all make rational choices because we're not all rational.
<br>
If everyone were rational, we would all agree on how to conduct this kind of
<br>
business, or we'd simply put it to a vote. Entangling alliances are a
<br>
nuisance, but that's what we pay politicians to handle. You say oil companies
<br>
have to pay the price of dealing with sultans who nationalize, and I say the
<br>
sultans should live up to their contracts or the sultans will have to pay the
<br>
price of their dishonesty and aggression, and that price is reflected in the
<br>
cost of US economic security, so everyone who wants to can join the modern
<br>
civilized world, despite despotic sultans and religious fanatics who try to
<br>
subvert and sabotage the free world. The bottom line is, it really doesn't
<br>
matter why fanatics hate the West, because Western civilization is more
<br>
resilient and robust than the hatred of fanatics, and we'll prevail no matter
<br>
what sick and wrong and ugly schemes they try.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
