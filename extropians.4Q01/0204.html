<em>&gt; The past is like the future, true...but also different.  Care must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken not to misapply history's lessons.
</em><br>
<p>History's foremost lesson is how to repeat history...
<br>
Commit it to memory so that we can do it all over again...
<br>
&nbsp;instead of forgetting it and trying something that hasn't been done.
<br>
It is because they _refuse_ to forget the past that the combatants of the
<br>
Middle East continue their stupid holy wars.

<p>From: &quot;Colin Hales&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:colin@versalog.com.au?Subject=Re:%20A%20Classical%20Humanist%20Worldview&In-Reply-To=&lt;07fb01c14c29$ae1a16c0$8c5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">colin@versalog.com.au</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; The focus is on a view to the past as the guide for the future and that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;classical human condition&quot; is a given and an end point. Not repeating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistakes of the past is obviously sensible but the tendered approach looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Luddite in the final analysis.
</em><br>
<p>Not repeating the mistakes of the past requires creating new solutions, and
<br>
that's what makes transhumanism different from humanism: The former seeks new
<br>
solutions which are not tethered to the past. What we should remember from
<br>
history is that the mistakes of the past were committed by people who were
<br>
steeped in history, and who reacted to history in the misguided belief that
<br>
they could correct history. People go on repeating history because they refuse
<br>
to try something new.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Author(s) seem intimidated by extropians or the ideas thereof. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't realise that: if what is on offer makes sense it'll be leapt upon by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extropian and the leaper will remain extropian enriched by a new meme. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think they get it. Or is it me who's missed something? I'm new to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all.
</em><br>
<p>You've summarized it well. Humanism has no room for transhumanism, but
<br>
transhumanists can learn from humanism (what little it has to offer, anyway)
<br>
and adapt it to the more energetic, creative, excellent, and practical
<br>
strategies of transhumanism.
<br>

<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
