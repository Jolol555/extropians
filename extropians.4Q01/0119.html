ABSTRACT: Brain fingerprinting,
<br>
a technique proven infallible in FBI tests and US Navy tests and accepted as
<br>
evidence in US courts, can be applied to a new problem: the problem of
<br>
accurately identifying trained terrorists before they strike. Had it been in
<br>
place on September 11, it would have prevented all of the attackers from
<br>
boarding the planes. It is the only technology for preventing other terrorist
<br>
attacks before they are carried out. For example, it is the only system that
<br>
will allow us to accurately identify all members of al Qaeda so we can keep
<br>
them off our planes today and prevent them from entering our country.

<br>
Dr. Lawrence A. Farwell has invented, developed, proven, and patented the
<br>
technique of Farwell Brain Fingerprinting, a new computer-based technology to
<br>
identify the perpetrator of a crime accurately and scientifically by measuring
<br>
brain-wave responses to crime-relevant words or pictures presented on a
<br>
computer screen. Farwell Brain Fingerprinting has proven 100% accurate in over
<br>
100 tests, including tests on FBI agents and tests for a US intelligence
<br>
agency and for the US Navy. Dr. Farwell recently presented Brain
<br>
Fingerprinting in court in defence of a man falsely convicted of murder.
<br>
Brain Fingerprinting has been featured on CBS 60 Minutes, CBS Evening News,
<br>
ABC World News, CNN Headline News, and the Discovery Channel, in U.S. News and
<br>
World Report, the New York Times, and in print and electronic media throughout
<br>
the world.
<br>
...
<br>
<p>The &quot;computerized security screen&quot; described in this paper and the calculation
<br>
of test results are all done totally under computer control; testing requires
<br>
no human intervention and no human interpretation. In the case of the FBI
<br>
tests, 100% of the determinations were correct. There were no false positives,
<br>
no false negatives, and no indeterminates. Eight years later there is still no
<br>
other technology or manual screening that comes close to these results. Brain
<br>
fingerprinting has been used to exonerate and well as to convict and it has
<br>
succeeded in difficult cases where all other methods have failed.
<br>
<p>In this document, we describe how, by combining brain fingerprinting
<br>
technology with iris identification, we can construct a system that combines
<br>
high security with convenience. It is a system that cannot be fooled, can
<br>
probe more areas than a typical manual screen, and is dramatically more
<br>
convenient and more accurate than manual security questioning. The system
<br>
described here is much more than just a high-tech, more effective version of
<br>
the security questions that they ask on El Al flights. In addition, it also
<br>
provides instant positive authentication at very low cost virtually anywhere
<br>
in the country. So you get the benefits of an in-depth security screen
<br>
everywhere in the country without cost or inconvenience.
<br>
<p>In our system, you are given a 10 minute computerized security screen only
<br>
once every few years (and when necessary if a new threat is identified), to
<br>
determine your &quot;security risk profile.&quot; This can be done on the day of travel
<br>
or anytime in advance, at your convenience. Once your data (your iris data,
<br>
name, and brain fingerprint security screen test results) are entered into a
<br>
federal databank, it is inexpensive and quick (under 1 second) to authenticate
<br>
you at airports, sports arenas, public buildings, etc. In fact, only an
<br>
Internet connection (which could be wireless) is required for authentication.
<br>
Where iris scans are cost prohibitive, an ID card used in conjunction with a
<br>
biometric sensor (such as fingerprints, hand geometry, etc) can be used to
<br>
achieve nearly equivalent speed, convenience, accuracy, and confidence.
<br>
Depending on your risk profile and the current entry policy of the place you
<br>
want to enter, you may or may not be allowed access.
<br>
<p>The system does not violate anyone's civil liberties. Unlike a human screener,
<br>
it cannot discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, religion, etc.
<br>
It is not a psychological profile. The computer cannot determine how you feel
<br>
about anything. It is best equated to an automated version of the Yes/No
<br>
security screening questions we have today. Essentially, it is nothing more
<br>
than a sequence of &quot;Have you seen this item before?&quot; questions. You may review
<br>
the questions in advance and you may choose to halt the test at any time. Your
<br>
answers cannot be used to incriminate you. The association of iris data and
<br>
your name is strictly optional and at your discretion. You may choose to be
<br>
tested totally anonymously without having to produce any ID whatsoever. So
<br>
this is actually more protective of people's privacy than many of the existing
<br>
security screens that people accept today.
<br>
<p>In order to account for possible negative public perception caused by a lack
<br>
of understanding of how the system works, the system should be phased in over
<br>
at least a year, and a manual screening option should be available during this
<br>
public phase-in acceptance period. Since all the terrorists in the 9/11 attack
<br>
arrived from outside the country, we could first require its use on all people
<br>
seeking entrance into the US from outside the country (regardless of whether
<br>
they are US citizens or not). The President and members of Congress should
<br>
also be screened before it is required of the general public. However, for
<br>
maximum effectiveness, the system should be adopted at all airports world-wide
<br>
so that we can restrict the movement of terrorists without restricting the
<br>
movement of the public at large.
<br>
<p>Other benefits accrue from this system as well. Iris scanners are already
<br>
installed and in use today at select airports and sports arenas. By requiring
<br>
their use at these places, the FBI can not only keep terrorists from entering,
<br>
but can capture a suspect for arrest or questioning. An iris scanner can tell
<br>
the operator to have security hold a suspect that the FBI has tagged in the
<br>
iris database.  Alternatively, the FBI can just use this information to track
<br>
the movements of suspects without arousing suspicion. All of this is
<br>
impossible to do today. A national iris databank can also be used for many
<br>
positive things such as uniting parents with children.
<br>
<p>It is critical that the US government provide the funds to commercialize the
<br>
use of brain fingerprinting to identify terrorists, because it is the most
<br>
cost effective way to combat terrorism in the US. However, without leadership
<br>
from the FAA to require the use of this system at US airports, this technology
<br>
will not be commercially developed on its own for this particular use.
<br>
<p>Unlike most other approaches, the approach described here provides a potent
<br>
weapon on the war against terrorism while actually increasing customer
<br>
convenience and enhancing security against a wide range of attacks  making it
<br>
at least 1,000 times more difficult for a terrorist to escape detection .  At
<br>
worst it adds only 1 second per authenticated entry and typically only 10
<br>
minutes for a re-screening once every few years.
<br>
<p>All the underlying technology necessary to implement the system described in
<br>
this document exists today; it just needs to be packaged for this new
<br>
application and installed in airports. In less than 90 days from receipt of a
<br>
request from the FAA, FBI, or Department of Transportation, we can prove the
<br>
concept is effective at identifying terrorists with over 90% certainty for
<br>
$100K (99.9% confidence is possible but will take more than 90 days). We can
<br>
construct a prototype &quot;airport scenario&quot; (construction of security screening
<br>
booths, creation of all security checkpoint types, and creation of software
<br>
needed to run a large airport) for less than $50M in less than 24 months.  All
<br>
the technology is off-the-shelf and it's just a packaging, programming, and
<br>
system integration problem. By capitalizing on new technologies, a system
<br>
using the approach described here could be put in place at all airports in the
<br>
US in less than 4 years at a total one-time capital equipment cost of under
<br>
$1B, the majority of which can be funded by private industry (the federal
<br>
government would set the standards and certify the manufacturers and
<br>
periodically test and certify the machines themselves).
<br>
<p>Once the system is in place, the cost to install additional authentication
<br>
security checkpoints can be as low as $300 per station. Since the system does
<br>
not require labor beyond the personnel who are already manning security
<br>
checkpoints, check-in desks and boarding gates, and because Internet
<br>
connectivity is so inexpensive ($1K per month for a high traffic airport), the
<br>
system described here does not appreciably increase annual operating costs to
<br>
run an airport.
<br>
<p>This system isn't perfect. It might allow 1 terrorist in 100 through. Is there
<br>
any other system that can determine an exact count of the number of terrorists
<br>
on a plane? Brain fingerprinting may sound silly. But consider the
<br>
alternative. Our next attack could be far worse. How many more people will
<br>
lose their lives before we take action? A million?
<br>
<p>Is there a better alternative for protecting innocent lives?
<br>

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
