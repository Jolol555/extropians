</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; First of all, let's get one thing completely straight.  The term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;transhuman&quot; is sometimes used as if it meant &quot;transhumanist&quot;, which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; object to, but is nonetheless an existing usage.  The term &quot;posthuman&quot;
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; absolutely reserved for genuine posthuman entities.  You can be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; posthumanist, but not a posthuman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who are you to tell ME what I can or cannot be! I am not a &quot;human&quot; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am &quot;after&quot; (post-) that species, although I acknowledge my human
</em><br>
ancestry
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The consensus of transhumanists is that not only are transhumans only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just on the verge of developing, posthumans do not exist and will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist for a while yet.
</em><br>
<p>But self-described &quot;Transhumanists&quot; are a minute fraction of the population,
<br>
and why should I pay any attention to your definistions when my are closer
<br>
to mainstream and dictionary definitions  &quot;post-human&quot; = &quot;after-human.&quot;
<br>
<p>We collectively spent the whole of the C20th, and much of the C19th
<br>
following Darwin's publications and Blavatsky's introduction of the
<br>
term &quot;post-human&quot; going through a mental shift from the traditional
<br>
human world view to the current view that we are substantial different
<br>
from our forebears ... in lifestyle, knowledge, physically, and even DNA!
<br>
<p>Furthermore, if you still have a human DNA
<br>
<em>&gt; pattern, you are still quite human.
</em><br>
<p>I am sure my DNA differs from yours. I suppose we could argue
<br>
about amounts of variation ... but am not sure that helps us, just
<br>
gets the debate bogged down in boring and regressive eugenics &amp;c.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Continuing to use such a term for yourself in violation of consensus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion on the matter only impunges your credibility toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'fruitcake' end of the scale.
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid all of us on this list (particularly the Californians amongst
<br>
us!)
<br>
have to carry that burden sometimes. This is a price paid by all
<br>
trail-blazers .....

<p>Hi Frederick
<br>
<p>The notion that we have evolved from human to the
<br>
next level allows us to define ourselves &quot;beyond&quot; the
<br>
human-era categories such as &quot;Asian&quot;, &quot;Japanese,&quot;
<br>
&quot;Shinto,&quot; &quot;Communist&quot; or whatever. This is an
<br>
advance. The important distinction becomes &quot;human
<br>
or posthuman&quot; not &quot;black or Caucasian&quot;, &quot;Christian or
<br>
Hindu&quot; or whatever.
<br>
<p>(1) Agree fully against violence &amp; killing. Our
<br>
main thrust is philosophical, posthuman evolution
<br>
is an idea, of benefit to many humans undoubtedly,
<br>
but not an idea demanding violent coercion .... or
<br>
of any threats &quot;on leaving&quot; such as Muslims who
<br>
might be killed if they renounce Islam, Freemasons
<br>
who might be ritually castrated or whatever, or even
<br>
like Scientologists who are subjects to visits and cult
<br>
pressure.
<br>
<p>See <a href="http://www.multi.co.uk/identity.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/identity.htm</a> for key information.
<br>
<p>(2) I do think that most folks operate in a state of trance
<br>
pretty much all the time, and reverse hypnosis/ MVT or some
<br>
other enlightenment system is a good thing. But unlike mind-
<br>
control systems, I think we should aim for full debate and full
<br>
information ..... if MVT isn't true, the process of discovering
<br>
why this might be the case is of the utmost importantance ...
<br>
whereas the bible-believer has a necessarily closed mind-set.
<br>
You cannot rewrite the bible or Koran, not empirically test
<br>
its claims. The archaic texts are fossilised in time, and useless as
<br>
sources of unfolding and universal truth for that reason.
<br>
<p>See <a href="http://www.multi.co.uk/schedule.htm">http://www.multi.co.uk/schedule.htm</a> for info on becoming
<br>
UPGRADED to posthuman and on MVT therapy. Regards
<br>
the &quot;Law&quot; this is a social convenience and is interpreted for
<br>
pragmatic reasons ... it is an aspect of politics ... to have any
<br>
input into the debates about changing various Laws we have
<br>
to engage with adversaries in political debates and elections.
<br>
<p>Hope this answers your various questions?

<em>&gt; &gt; I find the whole Singularity debate on a par with the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, what is your projection for human existence in 2020?
</em><br>
<p>Hopefully everyone will mostly understand MVT by then and will
<br>
be benefitting from having adopted post- or neohuman identites
<br>
that better reflect their natures than the previous delusion that they
<br>
were &quot;humans.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Technology itself has taken a mega-knock when the world's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most technologically advanced nation is bashed by a few men
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; armed just with penknifes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Armed with 757s. This is an extreme example of the power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiplier that technology gives the individual. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scary, but it's not a step backward away from technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather, and more frighteningly, it's a glimpse of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens when technology becomes more accessible to anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who really wants it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the example does a highlight this danger with technology.
<br>
A nuclear powerstations might be exploded by someone with
<br>
TNT .... but you cannot say the guy with the TNT had control
<br>
of nuclear technology, just TNT technology .....
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; You are not human? Your philosophy does not appear to be post-humanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me, since humans have been attempting to &quot;transcend&quot; by emphasizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mental over the material for thousands of years, without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproducible success.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I am careful never to describe myself as &quot;posthumanist&quot; since
<br>
I agree with the broad thrust of humanist philosophy.
<br>
<p>The difference is that I claim to have solved the mind-body problem
<br>
by overcoming Leibnitz and Spinoza's objections to Descartes by
<br>
MVT. The Materialist vs Idealist debate is thus subject to an
<br>
intertheoretic reduction.
<br>
<p>The difference between the singulatarian
<br>
<em>&gt; projections and earlier predictions is that the other predictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not consistent with any particular trend lines, but depend on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith. I include the millenialists and the whackier Y2K people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this category, along with many religious people. Please note that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-whacko Y2K folks spent hundreds of millions of dollars finding and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixing real computer bugs, some of which really could have caused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems, so Y2K was a real problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I follow the singularity idea with some interest, but am not
<br>
personally convinced by the case. Sure Y2K had a basis in
<br>
fact ..... my point is that the case was overstated, and became
<br>
subject to psychological panic and disproportionate response.
<br>
<p>ADVANCE!
