<p>
Previously &quot;One humanity, all in the same boat&quot;
<br>
<p>A short note: We should refrain from saying &quot;one humanity&quot; because that
<br>
would exclude alien species. I use unity in this case to
<br>
mean all sentient beings.
<br>
<p><p>I would like to ask readers here to consider a world separated more on
<br>
ideological divisions rather than mere race, geographical
<br>
location and skin color (or other equally superfluous different). In this
<br>
world, different communities abound where each community
<br>
offers a unique ideology where one can subscribe to.
<br>
<p><p>One can choose to join any of these communities freely, and can start a new
<br>
one if neccessary. This provides free competition (in
<br>
the uniquely productive rather than redundant sense). The communities will
<br>
follow a non-interventionist policy what some basic
<br>
important rules:
<br>
<p>1) Communities cannot detain people who wish to leave
<br>
2) They can restrict the people they take
<br>
3) Those who choose to stay or enter without permission will subject
<br>
themselves to the internal rules of the community (such as
<br>
punishment)
<br>
4) Communities cannot interfere in the affairs of the other communities who
<br>
signed this treaty
<br>
<p>Given this, no dictator can rule his or her own people without having
<br>
concern about them because these people can always choose to
<br>
go to another community. Meanwhile, it does not deprive others of the choice
<br>
to join, say, this dictatorship because of certain
<br>
(perceived) advantages that we might not consider rational (such as for
<br>
religious reasons).
<br>
<p><p>Such a world would provide vastly more choice for all people than say, one
<br>
dominated by socialist sentient AI (I mean this in a
<br>
positive way!) or a world dominated by an anacho-capitalist society. We
<br>
should not assume that people will have the same goals as us
<br>
(such as the pursuit of self-interest) or even that they have no goals at
<br>
all, but to provide them with choices such that they can
<br>
choose their own path.
<br>
<p>This could stop a lot of conflicts from happening because if people can live
<br>
the way they disire, then presumely they would not need
<br>
to fight for their &quot;cause&quot; whether we consider these rational or not. The
<br>
exception, of course, lies with those whose ideologies
<br>
require them to enslave or at least &quot;take over the world&quot;. This could cause
<br>
some problems until a system exists to keep them in
<br>
check (or wait until most people venture space leaving these people with a
<br>
sparsely populated planet Earth).
<br>
<p><p>I suggest considering this approach of &quot;many ideologies, many societies&quot;
<br>
over alternative approaches that champion any one of the
<br>
proposed social systems. No shoe can fit everyone and we should learn that
<br>
the easy, rather than the hard way.
<br>
<p>We should also have a wider prespective rather than the egocentric &quot;my
<br>
people&quot;, &quot;my country&quot;, &quot;my planet&quot;  and even &quot;my species&quot;
<br>
thinking. This kind of attachment causes a lot of unneccessary problems when
<br>
they conflict with others thinking along similiar
<br>
lines.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the first lesson any advanced sentient being can teach us, on first
<br>
contact, would consist of knowledge on how to live with
<br>
ourselves. Technology will not serve us well if we only bothered to use it
<br>
to build bombs to blast each other.
<br>
