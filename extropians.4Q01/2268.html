<p>&gt; Does this mean that you are allowed to shoot sociopaths whenever you feel
&gt; like it? It does advance the life-wish of innocent humans.
&gt; 
&gt; #### If there was a highly reliable method of diagnosing sociopathy (for
the
&gt; sake of this discussion let's define it as a stable lack of concern for
the
&gt; survival wishes of other people, despite being fully aware of them) then
it
&gt; would be perfectly reasonable to pre-emptively control such persons,
&gt; especially by preventing them from ever being in a position of force
without
&gt; direct supervision.
<p>OK, this is a reasonable position I can agree with. An increased risk
is handled by adding a commensurate safeguard. But I don't see *why*
you soften your initial position here?
<p>### Just political expediency - while I retain a lack of moral concern for
the life of such persons, I am willing to adapt the implementation of my
moral principles to the political situation, where pre-emptive control
without pre-emptive termination is more likely to be accepted and would
bring almost the same survival benefits as the original proposal.
<p>-----
<p>&gt; &gt;However, the commision of murder(=killing of an innocent
&gt; &gt;self-aware entity against its wishes) or even a verifiable willingness to
&gt; &gt;commit murder, is reason enough to lose the right to live
&gt; 
&gt; If you were an anti-abortionist this would be a great argument for killing
&gt; abortion doctors and pro-abortion people, wouldn't it? The biggest danger
of
&gt; your argument is that it can be interpreted so broadly.
&gt; 
&gt; ####  Anti-abortionnists do not define murder as I do - they have
&gt; epistemological difficulties leading them to erroneously conclude that
&gt; embryos have human rights. So, their ethics might be unimpeachable (they
&gt; want to kill those who initiate violence against defenseless children) but
&gt; their knowledge of the world is poor, therefore they make wrong decisions.
I
&gt; don't think that my basic argument can be abused any more than other
&gt; principles. After all, &quot;striking back&quot; can also be very broadly
interpreted.
<p>The problem here is that it might not just be epistemological
differences, but simply a different definition of human.
<p>I once met a girl who greeted me with &quot;Hi, murderer&quot;. She had heard of
my interest in uploading, and considered it murder since at the end of
the process you end up with a disassembled (dead) human and a non-human
simulacrum. A consistent position I disagree with, but understand. But
if she subscribed to your view of when it is allowed to initiate force,
she would not just be right in killing me when I tried to upload
someone, but also in killing me *now* because I would gladly upload a
willing test subject if it was possible - and hence show my disregard of
(deluded) human life from her position.
<p>### This is an amazing example, and it goes to show that with sufficiently
different ideas of self, and reality, understanding might be impossible in
principle - after all, you could meet a person believing that strangling you
with a scarf (as in thuggee) might not be killing - just sending you to a
different better reality, a noble service you will come to appreciate on the
other side. Two parties have to maintain at least some rudimentary areas of
agreement to be able to have a meaningful discussion. If there is none, all
that remains is the use of force. But in this case, if the girl subscribed
to my basic moral tenet, &quot;Innocent wish to survive may not be thwarted&quot;
(let's call it the Life Principle), then she would not initiate force here -
since the disassembled human wished to be uploaded (or in her reference
frame - wished to be dead in an unusual way), your action in helping him
would not be wrong - nobody's life-wish is thwarted here, despite having a
dead body. Helping a person commit suicide is in my opinion acceptable.
----
<p>Exactly. And it might be reasonable to try to get the person treated or
supervised. But if you attack him without him attacking you first, he
would have a moral right of defend himself regardless of how twisted he
was. 
<p>#### Now, I specifically exclude entities which do not accept the Life
Principle (whether in thought or in deed) from the protection afforded by
this principle - such persons have in my moral system a priori no rights,
hence they do not have a moral right to defend themselves. As you might
notice, this is somewhat self-referential but somehow I am not worried about
it.
<p>----
<p> 
&gt; #### By the way, correct me if I am wrong, you agree that the right to
live
&gt; might be revoked for actions, right?
<p>Only for initiation of force, and even then only to a minimal extent. I
do not, for example, believe that executions are ethically acceptable.
<p>####  Insistence on the initiation of force *only* in response to action
leads to the following - it means that innocent human lives have to be first
endangered or lost before a coercive action can be undertaken. Even if
reliable information is available, predicting that a particular person will
with 99% probability kill a random passer-by, you may not initiate force
against that person - if you are strict about what it means to initiate
force, you cannot even detain the prospective killer, or take away his gun.
A malign observer might even say that you demand a sacrifice of fresh
innocent blood on the altar of justice (I am not saying that, of course).
<p>----
 
The problem is that some information is subjective to a degree that no
amount of brain scan can give it to us. If we have different
philosophical views of what it means to be a human, then we might want
to kill each other as being clear menaces to human life but a judge
could not do anything other than rule on what definition of humanity the
legal system accepts - none of us can ever be shown wrong.
<p>### The legal system does implicitly and explicitly incorporate such
definitions, they are the basis for example for the laws regarding organ
donation. My modest proposal does not pose any new problem here. Even if you
want to restrain yourself to responses to &quot;force&quot;, you need to define what
entities are to be deemed worthy of being protected.  
 
----
<p><p>Detecting potential killers this way is a great idea - but I think
killing people for a virtual action (even if they thought it was real)
is not just excessive but immoral. No crime has been comitted: I view
crimes as bad things actually done to another being with rights, not
just a one-sided action - it is an interaction between two ethical
subjects. When you punish (severely) non-crimes, the whole scale of
justice tilts.
<p>### I am glad you like the idea. What if instead of killing those who fail
the test, we just detain them until they can pass the test? This is still
initiation of force without being provoked by an action, but it's not
irreversible, and as a bonus, fewer innocent bystanders would first need to
lose their lives, with all the potential killer being locked up before they
kill. Actually, there is already a law in the US, allowing any two
physicians to commit a person involuntarily if they believe this person is a
menace to others. The procedure is frequently called &quot;302&quot;, from the name of
the form you have to fill out.
<p>---- 
<p>The greatest risk is that your right to life is suddenly entirely in the
hands of the government (or whoever runs the testing). What happens when
a mistake is done, or some malicious person(s) forge data? You can never
appeal if you are dead.
<p>### Here you name the strongest argument against capital punishment - the
risk that innocent lives might be taken. I have no moral qualms against the
death penalty but this one argument is enough to soften my position
considerably. I still think that this punishment is acceptable in absolutely
certain cases, when you have somebody who kills hostages in a bank heist on
camera, leaves his DNA and skin flakes in the wounds he inflicts with his
knife, is apprehended while still dripping with their blood, and boasts
about how much fun he had. However, if there is the slightest doubt about
the defendant's guilt, I would agree with you on the practical level and be
more comfortable with life imprisonment. For the pre-emptive justice case,
it means non-punitive detention, with option of using deadly force only if
absolutely necessary to apprehend the sociopath. Non-punitive detention
means being in an institution with as little unpleasantness as reasonably
possible.
<p>----
<p>A deeper problem is that when you start to take away the most valuable thing
there is - life - then there is less resistance to take away other
valuable things.  If people can't make informed political decisions, why
allow them to vote? People who can't manage their economy, shouldn't
more competent people take their money and use it wisely on their
behalf? If you think so, maybe you should move to us in Sweden ;-)
<p>#### The slippery slopes exist whenever there are no strong moral
convictions. It's difficult to extend the Life Principle to voting rights,
wouldn't you think?
<p>It appears that even though our basic moral principles differ, both of us
would be comfortable with a remarkably similar set of legal implementations,
allowing a severely limited initiation of force (in my case - less limited
and more deadly) against persons objectively dangerous to their fellow
humans.
<p>And how did you guess that I'm against universal franchise? :-)
<p>I think that parliaments should be selected by a random drawing among
volunteer citizens (demarchy), with an IQ test being administered, splitting
them into the upper house (intellicracy), allowed to write laws, and a lower
house, allowed to refuse their passage.
