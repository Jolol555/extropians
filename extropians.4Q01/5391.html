<em>&gt; It's coming up time to talk about aid for Afghanistan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the U.S. should NOT do:
</em><br>
<p>Granted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What the U.S. should do:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Work with the government of Afghanistan to determine their needs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a power station here, a telecom central office there, a sewage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment plant over there. Then pay U.S. contractors to go over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and build these things at U.S. expense.
</em><br>
<p>I was told that this is commonplace (perhaps not in war-torn
<br>
countries, but in normal industry):
<br>
<p>A sponsoring country finances an initial feasibility study
<br>
for developing a resource (ore body, water, etc.).  Then,
<br>
contractors go and develop a &quot;prototype&quot; so to speak.  Then,
<br>
if that shows promise, a more in-depth feasibility study is
<br>
performed (again, at the cost of the sponsoring country).
<br>
If everything checks out, then the recipient country grants
<br>
the work effort to the sponsoring country (that did all the
<br>
initial up-front investment to do analysis) and that a large
<br>
percentage of the work be &quot;bought from&quot; the sponsoring
<br>
country's contractors.
<br>
<p>So, if the United States wants to get &quot;work&quot; out of Afghanistan,
<br>
it should pony up the initial pennies to send some bright people
<br>
over to examine the country (natural resources, population
<br>
centers with regard to geography, etc.) and put together some
<br>
feasibility studies and evaluations and recommendations.  If
<br>
they do a good job, then perhaps they'll earn the business.
<br>
<p>(Note:  This does not have to be a &quot;government&quot; activity --
<br>
businesses in the private sector should also be welcome to
<br>
go and do these activities, to try and nail down more and
<br>
new business.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Food aid will be required till at least next fall, so a primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern of the new government should be the spring planting. There has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been a drought recently, but I see plenty of rivers flowing, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps the first aid should include irrigation equipment/technology.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I'm putting the cart before the horse, but importing processed
<br>
foods is simple enough.  Distribution is always a big problem.
<br>
<p>Perhaps building &quot;warehouse club&quot; type supermarkets in high population
<br>
centers and creating an importing infrastructure would be a wiser
<br>
way to go?
<br>
<p>You'd need construction workers (local labor could yield low
<br>
cost), engineers, IT professionals and an assortment of other
<br>
miscellaneous skilled workers ... but in the current economic
<br>
state of the US with regard to unemployed skilled workers,
<br>
these people should be easy to come by.
