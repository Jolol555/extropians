Mitch:
<br>
My Reaction: Wow! Where and How are these information level stored???!!
<br>
They must have &quot;emerged&quot; as a production of natural selection, both 
<br>
biological and otherwise?
<br>
Did Stonier suggest that there is a process that converts matter and energy 
<br>
into information?
<br>
____________
<br>
<p>Yes, unfortunately Tom Stonier suggested something like that,
<br>
in his &quot;Information and the Internal Structure of the Universe&quot;.
<br>
<p>He starts with lamba = h [(1 - (v/c)^2)^1/2] / v m_0
<br>
and then he writes that lambda becomes infinite
<br>
with particles whose rest mass is zero and v = c.
<br>
<p>&quot;An infon&quot; - he writes - &quot;is a photon whose wavelength has been
<br>
stretched to infinity&quot;, and conversely, &quot;a photon is an infon travelling
<br>
at the speed of light&quot;, and also &quot;at velocities other than c, a quantum
<br>
of energy becomes converted into a quantum of information - an infon&quot;.
<br>
<p>Finally Stonier thinks that &quot;the hole left in an atomic shell by a lost
<br>
electron, consitutes a particulate form of information, i.e., an infon&quot;,
<br>
and that &quot;To fermions and bosons, therefore, we need to add a third
<br>
class of particles - infons. The first two represent the particulate
<br>
manifestation of matter and energy. Infons represent the particulate
<br>
manifestation of information; they include particles such as phonons,
<br>
excitons, and the holes left in atomic shells by ejected electrons.&quot;
<br>
<p>What can I say ... that's terrible, imo.
<br>
<p>The philosopher:J. B. Kennedy  [&quot;On the Empirical Foundations 
<br>
of the Quantum No-Signalling Proofs&quot;,  Phil. Sci., 62, 543-560 
<br>
(1995)] states that any proof that QM cannot support superluminal 
<br>
signalling, by using entanglement, is essentially circular. He argued 
<br>
by way of digging into the historical references, finding, for instance, 
<br>
von Neumann's original motivation for introducing the tensor product 
<br>
rule, for combining Hilbert spaces, it was essentially to block the
<br>
possibility of superluminal &quot;signalling&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, assume that some superluminal &quot;signalling&quot; - or, at least,
<br>
some superluminal &quot;influence&quot; - is possible, between entangled
<br>
systems (and quantum systems _might_ be entangled, for 
<br>
cosmological reasons, who knows?).
<br>
<p>Assume also that the entanglement can be modelled by the 
<br>
classical knot theory. To be more specific: any kind of
<br>
entanglement (or disentanglement) seems to be modelled 
<br>
by Borromean rings, and/or by Hopf rings, and/or by Brunnian 
<br>
rings. Thus it can be shown that there are entanglements, 
<br>
in many-particle systems, which are very peculiar. In example 
<br>
particle A can be in a space-time region remote (space-like
<br>
separated) from particle B and from particle C, yet an event 
<br>
befalling A influences strongly the _mutual_ relationship of B 
<br>
and C.
<br>
<p>Summing up: there is _some_ possibility that a quantum net
<br>
might exist, routing (and storing) superluminal &quot;signals&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;influences&quot;. Or (maybe) not?
<br>
<p>-s.

<p>Borromean (et al.) rings
