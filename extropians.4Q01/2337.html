<p>&nbsp;Ground War: The Northern Alliance Offensive
<br>
2355 GMT, 011107
<br>
<p>Summary
<br>
<p>The Pentagon is planning ground operations in
<br>
Afghanistan because an air campaign alone will not
<br>
defeat the Taliban. A strategic offensive by the
<br>
Northern Alliance, with extensive U.S. air support,
<br>
appears the most desirable option. But with opposition
<br>
troops unlikely to capture Kabul before winter falls,
<br>
the United States must prepare ground forces to launch
<br>
attacks in Afghanistan next spring.
<br>
<p>Analysis
<br>
<p>It is increasingly clear that the U.S. air campaign
<br>
alone will not break up the Taliban's resistance in
<br>
Afghanistan. With the harsh Afghan winter fast
<br>
approaching the Taliban as defiant as ever, there is
<br>
no hope that the war in Afghanistan will be over soon.
<br>
The Pentagon must explore ground war options in the
<br>
country. 
<br>
<p>Any ground force assembled from abroad would not be
<br>
able to launch before spring. Only forces already in
<br>
Afghanistan have a chance to defeat the Taliban before
<br>
winter. The U.S. command appears to be pinning its
<br>
hopes on the Northern Alliance, the only organized
<br>
military force opposing the Taliban on the ground.
<br>
However, the Northern Alliance lacks the manpower,
<br>
skills and equipment necessary to defeat the Taliban
<br>
in combat near Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif.
<br>
<p>The Northern Alliance -- a loose coalition of Tajiks,
<br>
Uzbeks and Hazaras -- has been fighting the Taliban
<br>
for seven years with little success. When the United
<br>
States launched air strikes a month ago, it did not
<br>
immediately try to help the Northern Alliance by
<br>
bombing the Taliban frontline positions.
<br>
<p>The Bush administration did this for two reasons.
<br>
First, it was mindful that crucial coalition supporter
<br>
Pakistan is a foe of Northern Alliance. Second, the
<br>
administration hoped that an air campaign and covert
<br>
attempts to turn Pushtun tribes in the country against
<br>
the Taliban would do much to achieve its goals.
<br>
Washington believed that the Pushtuns themselves would
<br>
overthrow the hard-line regime of Taliban leader
<br>
Mullah Mohammed Omar. But attempts by prominent
<br>
Pushtun leaders, including recently executed
<br>
opposition leader Abdul Haq, have failed so far.
<br>
<p>A week ago, Washington switched its strategy to heavy
<br>
bombing of Taliban forces opposing Northern Alliance
<br>
troops in positions north of Kabul, south of the
<br>
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif and close to the
<br>
Afghan-Tajik border in the northeast. The Bush
<br>
administration apparently believes that its massive
<br>
support to the Northern Alliance will not alienate
<br>
Pakistan, since even with the fall of Kabul the war
<br>
would be far from over and a role for pro-Pakistani
<br>
Pushtuns in a future government could still be
<br>
negotiated.
<br>
<p>The United States hopes the bombing will encourage the
<br>
Northern Alliance to launch a major offensive. So far,
<br>
the opposition has not undertaken an attack against
<br>
Kabul. Minor attacks at Mazar-e-Sharif have been
<br>
repulsed, although some tactical success was reported
<br>
40 miles south of the city on Nov. 6.
<br>
<p>Plans
<br>
<p>With the U.S. bombing campaign intensifying in recent
<br>
days, the Pentagon expects the Northern Alliance to
<br>
launch a major assault before winter. U.S. Defense
<br>
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld seems to have finalized the
<br>
coordinated support for such an offensive during his
<br>
recent visits to Russia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and
<br>
India. A spokesman for the Northern Alliance said Nov.
<br>
5 that the group is preparing to launch a major
<br>
offensive in about a week. 
<br>
<p>The plan is likely to include almost simultaneous
<br>
attacks on Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif. Taking Kabul
<br>
would mean a major military defeat for the Taliban and
<br>
would cut off its forces in the north from
<br>
Pushtun-populated areas in eastern and southern
<br>
Taliban strongholds. The United States would then be
<br>
able to establish a ground and air force presence in
<br>
the capital area and would be in a better position to
<br>
launch fresh attacks on the Taliban. 
<br>
<p>As important as Kabul is, taking Mazar-e-Sharif is
<br>
even more important. It would establish for the first
<br>
time a land corridor from abroad into Afghanistan, and
<br>
it could be used as an invasion route for U.S. ground
<br>
forces from Uzbekistan next spring. 
<br>
<p>Taking the city would also mean cutting the Taliban
<br>
forces in the north into two isolated groups, one in
<br>
western Afghanistan and another in the northeast. That
<br>
would make it easier for the opposition to defeat
<br>
significant Taliban formations and clear all of
<br>
northern Afghanistan. The Northern Alliance would also
<br>
establish direct communication and supply lines via
<br>
Mazar-e-Sharif between its forces in northwestern and
<br>
northeastern Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>The ground attacks by the Northern Alliance will
<br>
likely be supported by close U.S. air support,
<br>
including AC-130s and helicopter gunships. Air strikes
<br>
will be coordinated by U.S. Special Forces on the
<br>
ground, which will identify targets and the immediate
<br>
needs of the opposition units on the ground. 
<br>
<p>A major offensive on Mazar-e-Sharif would have to
<br>
start a few days before an attack on Kabul. The
<br>
Northern Alliance would want some forces, after they
<br>
have captured the city, to advance south along a major
<br>
highway to Pol-e-Khomri. Taking this city would cut
<br>
off a strong Kunduz grouping of the Taliban in the
<br>
north. Allied forces would then proceed further south
<br>
through the strategic Salang pass to secure the
<br>
heights around the Bagram air base and eventually join
<br>
the fight in Kabul. 
<br>
<p>Though the Northern Alliance command envisions heavy
<br>
fighting at each stage, especially around Kabul, it is
<br>
counting on a focused and severe U.S. bombing to make
<br>
Taliban frontline resistance impossible. The
<br>
opposition hopes to take Mazar-e-Sharif in three days
<br>
after the beginning of a major attack there and then
<br>
capture Kabul by the end of the month. 
<br>
<p>Impact of geography and terrain
<br>
<p><p><p>The Northern Alliance offensive will take place on
<br>
very complex terrain, mostly high-altitude mountains.
<br>
The Hindu Kush mountains to the north of Kabul range
<br>
from 4,500 meters (14,764 feet) to 6,000 meters
<br>
(19,686 feet). The altitude descends in the direction
<br>
of Kabul to 3,000 meters (9,843 feet)and lower. The
<br>
Alliance forces near Kabul will use the mouth of the
<br>
Panjshir Valley as their staging ground. As it nears
<br>
Kabul, the fight will be concentrated on a narrow
<br>
front. On the one hand, this means the opposition will
<br>
have to use mostly frontal attacks that typically lead
<br>
to heavy losses. On the other hand, the concentration
<br>
of Taliban defenders in a small area means that they
<br>
are also likely to suffer major casualties from the
<br>
U.S. bombardment. The key to taking Kabul is securing
<br>
control over several strategic heights where the
<br>
Taliban forces have fortified their positions for
<br>
years. 
<br>
<p>The hardest part for the Alliance would be if some
<br>
Taliban forces decide to fight within the city limits.
<br>
Urban fighting in Kabul -- a large city with myriad,
<br>
partly ruined low buildings and hundreds of narrow
<br>
streets and dead ends - would represent a nightmare
<br>
for any attacking force. 
<br>
<p>The Alliance reinforcements that intend to join the
<br>
fight for the capital after taking Mazar-e-Sharif
<br>
would have to move slowly because the only highway
<br>
from there to Kabul is barely usable, due to numerous
<br>
bombings and mine explosions in recent years. The main
<br>
obstacle would be getting through the strategic Salang
<br>
Pass, which has an altitude of 3,878 meters (12,723
<br>
feet). The pass previously served the opposition well;
<br>
Alliance fighters exploded the south entry in order to
<br>
stop the Taliban offensive to the north. Now the
<br>
Taliban can use the same or similar techniques to stop
<br>
Alliance forces from advancing south.
<br>
<p>As to Mazar-e-Sharif, the city is located in the
<br>
steppes. Like any large city, it could potentially bog
<br>
down an attacking force. But it will be even more
<br>
difficult for Alliance forces to overcome stiff
<br>
Taliban resistance in the rogue foothills of the
<br>
Bozarak mountain range, where heavy fighting with no
<br>
decisive changes has been reported for the last
<br>
several days. Unfortunately for the opposition, it
<br>
does not control the plains to the north of the city.
<br>
However, this northern route from the Uzbek border
<br>
city of Termez can be used by Uzbekistan's government
<br>
forces if President Islam Karimov decides to send
<br>
troops camouflaged as Northern Alliance fighters to
<br>
the battle for Mazar-e-Sharif. Uzbek military sources
<br>
say Karimov is keen on the idea but hesitates because
<br>
he fears political repercussions at home and reprisals
<br>
from the Taliban.
<br>
<p>A poor network of airfields in the regions around
<br>
Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif make close air support for a
<br>
ground offensive very difficult. The only airstrip the
<br>
United States can try to use for both logistics and
<br>
fire support has just been built with advice from U.S.
<br>
instructors in Gulbohar. The airstrip is located at
<br>
the mouth of the Panjshir Valley, 50 miles to the
<br>
north of the capital. Using it will be risky due to
<br>
its proximity to the frontline. The Taliban are
<br>
threatening to destroy the airstrip by firing tactical
<br>
missiles and long-range howitzers, Pakistan's Nation
<br>
reported Nov. 7. 
<br>
<p>It would appear that the task of providing close air
<br>
support to Northern Alliance troops in the forthcoming
<br>
offensive will fall almost entirely to the U.S. Air
<br>
Force and Navy located outside the country. In this
<br>
regard, getting three air bases just to the north of
<br>
the war theater, in Tajikistan -- as was announced
<br>
during Rumsfeld's visit to the country -- may help.
<br>
But getting the bases ready to host the U.S. ground
<br>
attack aircraft will take time. It is unlikely this
<br>
job will be finished by the time the Northern Alliance
<br>
launches its offensive.
<br>
<p>Military capabilities
<br>
<p>The balance of military forces near the frontlines at
<br>
Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif will determine the success of
<br>
the Northern Alliance offensive. The opposition lacks
<br>
the necessary minimum manpower and equipment ratio of
<br>
3:1 to defeat the Taliban.
<br>
<p>On the Kabul front, the Taliban -- with 15,000
<br>
soldiers deployed in three brigade-size formations --
<br>
outnumbers the alliance despite the U.S. bombing
<br>
campaign. A 4,000-strong brigade of Pakistani
<br>
volunteers is also moving into position near Kabul. Of
<br>
about 8,000 more Pakistani volunteers that crossed the
<br>
border to join the fight, about 2,000 traveled to the
<br>
Kabul front. Some 5,000 Arab militants were based in
<br>
Afghanistan before U.S. strikes began Oct. 7, and a
<br>
majority of them are still in the Kabul area. With
<br>
nothing to lose, they will prove among the city's
<br>
staunchest defenders -- unless the Taliban and al
<br>
Qaeda commanders disperse them and other forces in the
<br>
countryside to prepare for guerrilla attacks. Since
<br>
Oct. 7, hundreds of other Arabs and other militants
<br>
have entered Afghanistan, potentially bringing the
<br>
Taliban's manpower at Kabul to 25,000.
<br>
<p>Most are light infantry armed with Kalashnikov
<br>
submachine-guns, other small arms and grenade
<br>
launchers. About 60 tanks, 80 infantry combat vehicles
<br>
(ICVs) and armed personnel carriers (APCs), 60 various
<br>
field guns and howitzers (from 76- to 152-mm caliber),
<br>
70 multiple rocket launching systems, hundreds of
<br>
mortars, anti-tank weapons and recoilless rifles -
<br>
almost all Soviet-made - are still operational at
<br>
Kabul. There may be about 10 operational SS-1A/B SCUD
<br>
surface-to-surface tactical missiles. Taliban air
<br>
defenses there include more than 100 low-range
<br>
anti-aircraft guns and a few dozen Stingers. What is
<br>
left after the U.S. bombing is unlikely to be used in
<br>
the battle for Kabul.
<br>
<p>Tajik forces, the strongest part of the anti-Taliban
<br>
coalition, will launch the offensive on Kabul. About
<br>
12,000 fighters are gathered on the front. Until
<br>
recently the Alliance had about 40 tanks there and
<br>
roughly the same number of ICVs and APCs, about 50
<br>
various artillery pieces, about 15 SCUD and FROG-7
<br>
missiles and dozens of other heavy weapons, all
<br>
Soviet-made. 
<br>
<p>In October, Russia decided to provide extensive,
<br>
urgent deliveries to the Tajik force. These included
<br>
about 40 T-55 tanks, 100 other armored vehicles, six
<br>
batteries of 122-mm D-30 howitzers, two batteries of
<br>
100-mm MT-12 anti-tank guns, four batteries of 120-mm
<br>
mortars, three batteries of 82-mm automatic mortars,
<br>
10 122-mm Grad multiple rocket launchers, 100
<br>
anti-tank missile launchers, 200 grenade launchers and
<br>
thousands of small arms, as well as four to six Mi-24
<br>
helicopter gunships and the same number of transport
<br>
helicopters, Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported Oct. 10,
<br>
citing military sources. Almost all the arms - paid
<br>
for by Britain -- were designated for the Kabul front.
<br>
<p><p>STRATFOR believes that only a minor portion of this
<br>
arsenal has reached the frontline, for two reasons: a
<br>
majority was sent by train, and Uzbekistan - which
<br>
supports only Uzbek factions of the Northern Alliance
<br>
-- has not allowed Russian trains with arms to cross
<br>
the Uzbek-Tajik border. The arms have had to follow a
<br>
longer route via Kyrgyzstan. 
<br>
<p>On the Mazar-e-Sharif front, the Taliban has deployed
<br>
two 2,500-strong battalions. About 3,000 militants
<br>
from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and
<br>
roughly 1,000 Chechen fighters also defend the mostly
<br>
Uzbek-populated city. In addition, pro-Taliban forces
<br>
may receive some reinforcements from larger
<br>
contingents located to the east in the area of Kunduz:
<br>
2,500 Taliban soldiers and about 5,000 IMU militants.
<br>
Mazar-e-Sharif defenders are armed with 20 tanks, 30
<br>
ICVs and APCs, 25 various field guns and howitzers, 15
<br>
multiple rocket launching systems, several dozen
<br>
mortars, anti-tank weapons and recoilless rifles.
<br>
Taliban air defenses there include about 40 low-range
<br>
anti-aircraft guns and about 10 Stingers.
<br>
<p>The Uzbek forces of Gen. Abdul Dostum - who is
<br>
infamous for repeatedly changing sides during the
<br>
Afghan civil war - will launch the offensive on
<br>
Mazar-e-Sharif. Dostum has about 7,000 fighters on the
<br>
front, including about 2,000 on loan from the Uzbek
<br>
army, according to sources at the Uzbek Ministry of
<br>
Defense. They are armed with about 15 tanks and 30
<br>
ICVs and APCs, about 20 various artillery pieces, 10
<br>
multiple rocket launchers and several dozen other
<br>
heavy weapons. Russia does little to supply this Uzbek
<br>
force, and Uzbekistan cannot fully substitute for
<br>
Moscow. On the eve of the offensive, U.S. transport
<br>
helicopters were actively supplying Dostum with
<br>
ammunition from Uzbekistan's caches. 
<br>
<p>Yet on both fronts, Northern Alliance troops are still
<br>
short of ammunition and fuel, and they have gone
<br>
unpaid for months. One commander on the Kabul front
<br>
said each of his tanks has been allocated 26 gallons
<br>
of fuel, &quot;just about enough to drive to the frontline
<br>
and back,&quot; according to Agence France Presse. 
<br>
<p>Also, on both fronts, the Taliban have cleared large
<br>
areas around vital defense areas and laid tens of
<br>
thousands of mines. Many bridges and tracks in ravines
<br>
and narrow passes have been prepared for demolition
<br>
and ambush, while accumulated reserves of ammunition,
<br>
spares and fuel may last at least six months in
<br>
combat, according to AFI Research.
<br>
<p>On both fronts, the Taliban and the Northern Alliance
<br>
lack coherent command and communications structures
<br>
typical of modern armies. But the Taliban appears to
<br>
have a larger number of combat-tested Afghan field
<br>
commanders, some command cadres from Pakistan and
<br>
experienced guerrilla leaders from Chechnya, Kashmir
<br>
and some Arab countries.
<br>
<p>The U.S. bombing campaign has not broken the Taliban's
<br>
morale, which remains higher than the combat spirits
<br>
of the Northern Alliance. The same is true for combat
<br>
qualities and skills of the soldiers. In a war in
<br>
which light infantry plays a vital role, these
<br>
advantages are likely to help the Taliban withstand
<br>
the forthcoming Northern Alliance offensive.
<br>
<p>Operations
<br>
<p>A Northern Alliance offensive represents the only
<br>
chance for the United States and its allies to turn
<br>
the tide of war before winter comes. U.S. air strikes
<br>
will play a crucial role in this offensive, but a few
<br>
factors may preclude the opposition from taking full
<br>
advantage of close air support.
<br>
<p>First, close air support cannot be effective if the
<br>
attack aircraft originate thousands of miles from the
<br>
war theater, which excludes B-52s and other strategic
<br>
bombers. Carrier-based F-18s and F-16s also lack the
<br>
range to reach Mazar-e-Sharif. That leaves the United
<br>
States with only 21 AC-130s and about 25 F-14s capable
<br>
of refueling and reaching the frontlines. Washington
<br>
could improve its position if U.S. helicopter gunships
<br>
from Uzbekistan are used, and if Russia and Uzbekistan
<br>
send their ground assault aircraft into battle.
<br>
<p>Second, Northern Alliance commanders and soldiers lack
<br>
experience in conducting consecutive ground attacks
<br>
under close air support. The help of U.S. Special
<br>
Forces on the ground is unlikely to reduce confusion,
<br>
and some friendly bombing within the opposition units
<br>
could occur.
<br>
<p>Third, on the both fronts the ferocity of combat will
<br>
often amount to close and even hand-to-hand combat.
<br>
Providing air support in these instances will be
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p>Fourth, even if all strategic heights around Kabul are
<br>
leveled, the battle for the city will not be over. The
<br>
Taliban is likely to engage the Northern Alliance in
<br>
street fighting, and some Kabul citizens -- half of
<br>
whom are Pushtuns who remember atrocities committed by
<br>
Tajik and Uzbek troops in 1992 to 1995 -- are likely
<br>
to join the defenders' ranks. 
<br>
<p>The most the Northern Alliance can do by winter is
<br>
capture some important heights north of Kabul under
<br>
heavy U.S. air support, allowing the city to be
<br>
shelled through winter. However, it is more likely a
<br>
Northern Alliance offensive will be bogged down and
<br>
make only minor tactical gains.
<br>
<p>Dostum's offensive on Mazar-e-Sharif may be more
<br>
successful if a couple of Uzbek mechanized infantry
<br>
brigades move toward the city. Both sides could
<br>
encircle and gradually squeeze the defenders out of
<br>
town. But even then, the fate of the battle in
<br>
northern Afghanistan would remain far from certain. 
<br>
<p>The Taliban has a 1,500-person force on the
<br>
Afghan-Uzbek border that may delay Uzbekistan's march
<br>
southward. The difference in combat qualities of each
<br>
side is such that several hundred Chechen fighters
<br>
could also easily wear down the forces of Dostum and
<br>
Uzbekistan in urban fighting in Mazar-e-Sharif.
<br>
<p>No air support, however devastating and timely, can
<br>
save a ground force from defeat if it is inferior to a
<br>
determined opponent on the ground. If the United
<br>
States is serious about destroying the Taliban, a
<br>
bloody war next year with numerous U.S. and allied
<br>
forces on the ground in Afghanistan is a must.
