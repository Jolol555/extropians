ARGHHH!!!  And to think, I would shake my head at people who would make this same mistake.  I apologize to Eliezer and the list.  
<br>
<p>Well, I was eventually planning on telling the list about Microbion. LOL!  I think it is worth watching over the next several years as it develops, and possibly goes public.  The founder told me a website will be developed in time. 
<br>
<p>I recently met a wonderful woman online who was raised in Alaska.  And she will even be coming back up for the Christmas holidays!  Yeah!!  I'm glad my email to her didn't wind up here! lol  It was pretty mushy.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
