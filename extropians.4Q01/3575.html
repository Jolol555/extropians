<em>&gt; BTW, I think there are a couple of reasons genetic engineering ought to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given more prominence in Transhumanist thinking. First, it is something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we could start right after lunch--at least we have the technology, we just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need the resources and the political will.
</em><br>
<p>We do not have the technology.  We have the technology to make arbitrary
<br>
alterations to DNA, in the same sense that we have the technology to make
<br>
arbitrary alterations from ones and zeroes.  Going from DNA to
<br>
intelligence enhancement is not necessarily easier than going from ones
<br>
and zeroes to Artificial Intelligence.  And your compile-build-debug cycle
<br>
is 14 years long, and illegal.
<br>
<p>My guess as to the best course is to try implanting (in adults - still
<br>
illegal, but in no wise immoral) Calvinian hexagonal grids of Neural
<br>
Signals's neurotrophic electrodes as adapted for &quot;write access&quot; as well as
<br>
&quot;read access&quot;, implanted across two or more humans and locked into
<br>
synchronization, on the off-chance that the two brains will learn to
<br>
decode each other's cerebral codes and start talking to each other. 
<br>
(Prerequisite:  That William Calvin is right about the representation of
<br>
the cerebral code.)  If this works you can expand to 64-human grids and so
<br>
on, if the 2-human pairs aren't transhuman enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imagine if genetic engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smarter persons were taken on with the same sort of political enthusiasm as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landing men on the moon. I realize that around here genetic engineering is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not as &quot;sexy&quot; as uploading but it would seem wise not to put all our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthuman eggs in one basket. (After all, the claim that humans can create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI is an empirical and falsifiable proposition).
</em><br>
<p>Uploading is post-Singularity technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, my experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that when it comes to presenting the Transhumanist case it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better in the first instance to discuss concepts like 'posthuman' in meat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms. Talk about SIAI requires two conceptual leaps for most people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; namely, that we can create superintelligence and we can create AI.
</em><br>
<p>A PR issue which requires, as prerequisite, that an unbiased line of
<br>
reasoning have previously established a reasonable probability of
<br>
meat-based transhumanity playing a part in the Singularity.
