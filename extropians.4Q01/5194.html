<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;That's a good example. I've also heard that the Japanese have refused to 
<br>
allow
<br>
the importation of lumber from the US, claiming that US lumber doesn't meet
<br>
their dimensional requirements, despite that US mills have offered to cut
<br>
timber to any specified dimensions. So, the Japanese buy timber from Oregon,
<br>
build furniture and other products out of it, and sell the finished products
<br>
to the US. With trade partners like that, it's no wonder the US has huge
<br>
deficits.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The Japanese means of quotas in order to &quot;protect&quot; their economy is legion. 
<br>
One memorable example was the refusal to permit American made snow skis to be 
<br>
sold in Japan, because Japanese snow was 'different.'  Some nation states and 
<br>
peoples will do whatever they feel is in their self interests (however 
<br>
misguided it may be) despite the evidence to the contrary, so be it.  This 
<br>
does give the Japanese a trade advantage, and as long as they wish to do it, 
<br>
they will.
<br>
<p>Notice that the Japanese electorate seem content to live in a less, plush, 
<br>
economy during the last 10 years, while the USA enjoyed the longest 
<br>
prosperity in its history. My point is that they are content with their trade 
<br>
practices. If at some point the USA demands reciprocity, and mutuality on 
<br>
trade, then, for better or worse; the Japanese will become discontent. 
<br>
Perhaps it is in the USA's interest to ignore unfair trade practices by the 
<br>
zaibatsu?
