</em><br>
<p>So send them out twice.  The real problem is that SETI@home was
<br>
underprepared for the overwhelming participation from the general
<br>
proletariat, so they sent the same work just to keep the masses
<br>
interested.  When these same proles started noticing and asking
<br>
they admitted they didn't know what else to do.

<p>No, I only had two machines working the problem, and began
<br>
getting repeat work within two months of the start.  Returned to
<br>
GIMPS.
<br>
<p>...btw: Why do you consider SETI processing to be more important that protein
<br>
folding?
<br>
<p>The cosequences of solving protein folding would be to add yet
<br>
another piece to the complicated puzzle of life.  Helpful, but not
<br>
revolutionary.  The consequences of discovering a ETI are inestimable,
<br>
mind boggling, awe inspiring.  I would do SETI again if I knew
<br>
they were not going to waste my contribution.  spike
