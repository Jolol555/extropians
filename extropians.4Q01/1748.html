<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the same thing. Intelligence collection, especially in preventing more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;war crimes, is of paramount importance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          Though we disagree about quite a few things, I'm afraid I agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Samantha here.  Coercing information out of these prisoners would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a good idea.  First of all, If these people were prisoners of war they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be protected by the third Geneva convention.  However, war has not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been declared, and these were not troops &quot;captured at the front lines,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;openly bearing weapons,&quot; or many of the other things that have to be true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for somebody to be a POW.  Where does that leave us?  These people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technically civilians.
</em><br>
<p>This is incorrect. The third Geneva Convention says that prisoners are
<br>
not to be tortured. Any other means is perfectly acceptable. Secondly,
<br>
war HAS been declared. It was declared by bin Laden 8 years ago.
<br>
Thirdly, a box cutter is a weapon in the current conflict, and those
<br>
four I specifically described all had box cutters or other weapons in
<br>
their posession. Troops do not have to be captured at the front lines to
<br>
be considered combatants either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;          Because Bin Laden's network operates on the &quot;need to know&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle I doubt that any of people we are holding have information that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be used to prevent other terrorist attacks, at least in the short term.
</em><br>
<p>No, it doesn't operate in that manner, it operates by a cell system,
<br>
which is different from 'need to know'. Anyone in a cell is aware of any
<br>
activities planned by that cell, as well as contacts and cutouts for
<br>
subsidiary and superior cells.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;          Until these people are convicted they deserve the protection of US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law, including the 5th amendment.  After conviction criminals do have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give up some rights, and I could live with the use of truth serum so long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it wasn't &quot;cruel and unusual punishment,&quot; just so long as we are dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure that these people really were terrorists.  The evidence against these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people was pretty impressive, but the stuff that I know about was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstantial, and so not enough to violate constitutional rights over.
</em><br>
<p>Having a) a scheduled flight from Newark to California the day of the
<br>
attack (that was cancelled), and then heading to a Texas border town
<br>
with box cutters (the preferred weapon of the hijackers) and ten
<br>
thousand bucks in cash in their posession is far more than
<br>
circumstantial, especially when one of them was already on the FBI's
<br>
watch list. Then you've got Jechariah Moussawi, who 'only wanted to
<br>
learn to fly the plane in the air' and was also on the watch list.
<br>
<p>If you mean that none of their activities, statements, or posessions
<br>
could be tied to an actual crime directly, that is obvious, because they
<br>
were never able to hijack a plane themselves, but it is rather obvious
<br>
that they were involved in the plot. Only a complete idiot would think
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p>Finally, I highly doubt that you or Samantha has ANY experience in
<br>
dealing with wartime legal issues, dealing with Geneva Conventions, etc.
