Well on both sides of the ocean there is private and public funding
<br>
for AI. Maybe not as much as for genetic engineering, but I would not
<br>
say zero. Perhaps you do not consider the applications that do get
<br>
funding, e.g. face recognition, translation, missile guidance, etc. as
<br>
Real AI, as in human equivalent or higher sentient systems. But don't
<br>
you think current &quot;baby AI&quot; projects can develop components that may
<br>
be usefully integrated when the technology for Real AI is available?
