<p>
Luddites, Terrorists, and Other Malcontents
<br>
<p>Because I have so much to do I often try to generalize problems and solve
<br>
several at once.  My favorite problem is keeping humanity, myself, my
<br>
favorite humans, and as many other people as possible alive.  Lately, I have
<br>
been thinking social conflict may be the greatest threat to humans (middle
<br>
aged and younger).
<br>
<p>I started with the concept of oppression and refined that to unreasonable
<br>
group violence.  That got me asking who are the most dangerous people in the
<br>
world.  But I think I have a better question.
<br>
<p>Separate humans from other animals and physical objects.  What are the human
<br>
behaviors, ideas, inventions, etc. that have done the most good or harm for
<br>
humans.  What have they been historically, what can we observe now, and what
<br>
do we think they will be in the future.  I think death is a good metric but
<br>
we can include injury, suffering, joy, etc.
<br>
<p>By looking at historical and current death rates around the world, filtering
<br>
out the contribution of nature, microbes, etc., and concentrating on the
<br>
effects humans are having on other humans I suspect some useful data will
<br>
come out.  What are humans doing that helps or harms other human beings?
<br>
Why are they doing it?  Which memes (ideas) reliably improve situations and
<br>
which make them worse.  Are there particular humans or groups consistently
<br>
doing a lot of harm or good?
<br>
<p>In many cases cause and effect will be unclear.  In many cases there will be
<br>
mixed effects.  However, I expect in some cases there will be clear effects
<br>
and fairly direct links to human behavior and thought habits which cause or
<br>
prevent deaths.  This analysis could be done for humans in general or could
<br>
be restricted to humans in developed or globally influential areas.
<br>
<p>I think this is a good general conception of the terrorist problem.  Once we
<br>
identify the helpful and harmful behaviors, ideas, people, etc. solutions
<br>
may be apparent.  One of the big tricks may be focusing on clear harm
<br>
(deaths, injury, etc.) which obviously flows from actual human actions and
<br>
ideas rather than developing a bunch of speculative theories.
<br>
<p>Legal, scientific, and historical reasoning all seem especially relevant to
<br>
this sort of analysis.  I think it will be important once such an analysis
<br>
is made to consider which people, (or ideas?) would be most likely to
<br>
actively oppose your efforts to support good and oppose harm.  The concept
<br>
may be fairly safe to discuss because most people mean to do good (I guess)
<br>
but once you have the list and start trying to do something about it you
<br>
will want to be sure you are prepared for opposition.  I suspect a lot of
<br>
people will simply desist if the arguments are clear and reasonable.
<br>
Whatever; solutions come after the friends and foes of life are identified.
<br>
<p>I have a few major projects (and a number of small personal ones) lined up
<br>
before I tackle this one but it is one of the likely paths I will go down in
<br>
pursuing my life extension goals.  I thought I would mention this one and
<br>
see if anyone wants to get started on it or throw some ideas around.  I see
<br>
it as a small to medium size group project but I think a few people could do
<br>
a lot of the groundwork.
<br>
<p>I see a possible application to AI ethics; certainly this is relevant to
<br>
human ethics.  This sort of analysis may also be helpful in looking at
<br>
recent terrorists incidents and formulating responses.  Then again, it might
<br>
be overkill.
<br>
<p>I suppose one of the perks of living in a fairly closed system (Earth) is
<br>
that it simplifies such cause and effect analysis.  One of the things the
<br>
World Trade Center massacre points out is that any such analysis best be
<br>
global in scope.
<br>
<p><p>As always, feedback is appreciated.
<br>
