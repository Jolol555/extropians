Interesting post. I think he makes several good points.

<em>&gt; As I think about the forms of defense that could protect us from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeated intense threats from insane but powerful small groups of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, I see few strategies that are appealing. We could try to live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in something like an immune system instead of a state with it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attendant army. It's plain, after all, that a traditional army is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ill-matched to the present threat. The immune system metaphor is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolting to us, however, because we've all struggled so hard to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cease to be racist or to otherwise divide the human family into the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar and the foreign.
</em><br>
<p>I find it interesting that he views the immune system as inherently
<br>
xenophobic. I know he bases this on how the actual immune system works
<br>
(anything not belonging to the self must be destroyed or expelled), but
<br>
to me the immune system conjures up the concept of something
<br>
distributed, pervasive and adaptive rather than xenophobic. One can
<br>
protect a society without being xenophobic, and the ideal way of dealing
<br>
with small groups of enemies is to be good at detecting them on the
<br>
individual level rather than look at overbroad classes. 
<br>
<p>Transparency is a first order such system: there are sensors for
<br>
mischief everywhere. In order to retain an open society these have to be
<br>
aimed not just as potential terrorists but at everybody, especially the
<br>
powers that be. It is no coincidence that David Brin talked about the
<br>
immune system of democracy when he discussed the people keeping checks
<br>
on the powerful (for good and bad reasons); what could be needed is to
<br>
extend this system into an overall system of mischief detection, both
<br>
external, internal and autoimmune. 
<br>
<p>Of course, that won't stop people from communicating by strong crypto.
<br>
But it is not the evil thoughts that matter, it is the evil deeds. If
<br>
everything done in cyberspace remains secret but everything done in the
<br>
real world can be monitored, we still have a pretty good defense. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is also a McLuhanesque thought that has occurred to me. In the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last few years, the Arab world has encountered its own mass media for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first time, in the form of satellite television stations. I've 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen a little of the material, and it is inflammatory. It might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case that societies require some years to get sufficiently used 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mass media so as not to be driven insane by it. World War II might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have had something to do with the West's early experience of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power of mass media and modern propaganda. Over time one grows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat immune to it. In this light, cynicism is seen to be not only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good thing, but a mental habit that is necessary if any society is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to survive in an age of potent media.
</em><br>
<p>I found it ironic that the US has asked Quatar to rein in the arabic
<br>
satelite channel based there, on the grounds that it could supply
<br>
information to Afghanistan. I sincerely hope they do not bend to that
<br>
pressure. That satelite channel has caused the ire of most governments
<br>
in the area, since it actually sends its own news that doesn't follow
<br>
any party line (except not criticizing the government of Quatar - that
<br>
was part of the deal they made; everything else is fair game) and does
<br>
some serious journalism on its own (it has correspondents in Afghanistan
<br>
right now and has in the past uncovered quite a few embarrasing truths
<br>
elsewhere in the arab world). So far Quatar has not done anything, and I
<br>
hope they will be even less persuaded by the US than Saudi Arabia. 
<br>
<p>The point is, all the other mass media in the region are state
<br>
controlled. You can figure out what that means. Open societies need free
<br>
media, and the US seems to be making a grave mistake if they try to
<br>
limit the only existing free media in the region. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Is our way of marketing science and technology part of the problem? I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must emphasize that it's the marketing that I worry about, not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological capabilities or scientific theories. I'm thinking of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way we market computers as living things and Darwinian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation as an oracle. Some of this must play very strangely to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who are poor and wonder what will happen to them as the elites 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the West soar into uncharted heavens on the wings of Moore's Law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the genome, hoping to leave even the most basic rules of life as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was known behind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is violent fundamentalism in part encouraged by a sense that science 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and technology are ruining faith in the soul?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not talking about any notion of an immortal soul. I just mean the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense that a person is somehow really there, conscious, that when one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicates with other people they are similarly really there. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know many of the respondents on edge.org believe it's only a mental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusion to feel alive, but I beg you in this instance to reconsider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your position. You can do so without harming science in any way, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'd be more honest for having done it.
</em><br>
<p>This is a very good point, although I doubt the problem is really the
<br>
soul in his sense, but rather the more extended feeling that science is
<br>
unweaving the rainbow and promoting a divided and meaningless world
<br>
painted with the &quot;colorless all-color&quot;. That is clearly something we
<br>
need to deal with, both in showing that it is not true (not by denying
<br>
it but by showing how the enlightenment world is actually vibrant with
<br>
meaning and connection) and to avoid the technoshamanism it is so easy
<br>
to fall into.
<br>
<p>Lanier is a critic of transhumanism, but in many ways a good critic. He
<br>
points out weak points in our program or in how it is presented (which
<br>
is just as important), and it is up to us to show him that he is wrong
<br>
or adjust our actions to make him wrong. He is on the enlightenment side
<br>
like us, unlike Leon Kass and Jeremy Rifkin, and he appreciates the
<br>
benefits of technology and freedom far more than Bill Joy.
