<em>&gt; The US has formally notified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.N. that her targets may go beyond Afghanistan and raised this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue in the Security Council this morning - which implies that it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well happen soon - which is exactly the case I understood previously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Refer <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,36006,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,36006,00.html</a> accessed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2001-10-08
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The immediate result is very similar (dead people, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justice), and the consequences for the US and the world are, in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion, likely to be worse than 9-11. How much worse I don't yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, but I have previously suggested that I consider bin Laden to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far more fiendish than anyone I have heard discussing this has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figured, I see no reason to change this analysis, and I suspect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US is doing exactly as he anticipated and hoped for (although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think that even he has a handle on the magnitude of the disaster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is coming). As I read it, his little needles are designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensure that the US follows the path he desires (sometimes not knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what your enemy is saying is to be preferred).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a pestilential butterfly stirring, only it is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan rather than Mongolia, and I fear that the storm will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more loathsome than anyone expects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not unrelated, last night we dropped 37,000 meals (and no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medicines) or putting it in perspective, assuming all of those meals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are delivered to people who need them, we provided meals for one day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 1/2% of the people who desperately need them. If we use all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aircraft committed to date, and all of the flight crews, exclusively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deliver food during daylight hours, we will be able to feed at most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3% of the starving population of Afghanistan - which will probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean that in February the Hajj will open to the news of 6 million plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead Afghans. And it will be portrayed and believed to be largely the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fault of the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; May I suggest that the US should hope that the Muslim is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfeeling as he has recently been portrayed here, else the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences are going to be catastrophic throughout the Islamic world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - and I suspect that the US and the world is in any case going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrown into a condition of chaos from which it will not emerge in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anywhere near the same condition as now - and that this is bin Laden's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deep desire as he believed that the West can only go down while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking that Islamic nations, being less reliant on sophisticated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economies, will avoid the worst effects of the brewing storm. ==== re:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virus: 'I believe the terrorists wanted a nuclear attack on Baghdad'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Filed: 07/10/2001) &lt;brutal snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right idea, wrong target.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As previously observed, the US is perceived by a vast majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Muslims as being something reprehensible. The reason for this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primarily because of our ongoing support for Israel, despite her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ongoing illegal occupation of the West Bank and brutal oppression of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilians. Secondly due to our involvement in 3rd world countries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually to put down &quot;democratic&quot; movements in the hope of promoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;stability&quot; or against &quot;socialist&quot; movements in the &quot;war against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communism.&quot; What this has meant is that the US is generally perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have been taking the part of dictators and kings, against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unenfranchised and those discriminated against. This applies even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kuwait (where we are seen as having thrown out a dictator whom we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created, in order to preserve a more pliant king). Thirdly, we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen to abandon our allies as soon as we achieve our immediate goals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaving them to absorb the brunt of any retribution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we are indubitably seen as the worlds greatest oppressors and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypocrites. The truth of this is largely irrelevant. It is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perception which matters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let us assume that bin Laden is one pissed off dude, who really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes, fervently and frothingly that Allah wants to bring America
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down - and that he is the &quot;chosen instrument of the almighty&quot;. Despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this belief, he also happens to be smart - he is a qualified civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineer (one of the &quot;difficult&quot; engineering areas) - with over two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades of training in guerilla warfare, and by all accounts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensive logistical and business experience. Given his success in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these areas, the man is nobody's fool. As we have seen, he is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charismatic and articulate, and preaching to people who believe as he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does, which always makes the job of creating converts easier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question he had to answer, and has had ten years to work on, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to do this? He will have analyzed his actions, particularly in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light of US military tactics and responses to his actions over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last decade. I strongly suspect that he believes that the US will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underestimate him, and he is fully aware that they know very little of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the history, the geography, the people or the politics of the region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being no fool, he knows that no matter how wealthy he is, no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how effective the ratio of expenditure, he cannot hope to cost enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in lives or money for the US to give up on the Middle-East and go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home. He has to achieve one or both of two things. One is to massively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiply his forces - in effect, to turn the entire Middle-East into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his army. Secondly he has to create forces within the United States
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which have the power to rip her apart.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He cannot do this with the Taliban. They are a small group, able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operate effectively only within the context of Afghanistan. He could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly lure the US into that death bowl, and achieve some small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfaction in knowing that this has the potential to harm them. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US Army is no longer an army of conscripts, and they don't fight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wars in a way which exposes them overmuch to danger. Which means that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will not accomplish terribly much in that environment - but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also means that they will not have much to lose. He has to know this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just as he has to know that America will eventually win this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He also has to know that he is not going to achieve much in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Palestine. They are not equipped to defeat Israel. While he might have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hoped that his actions would cause the US to reconsider her support,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he is, I think, too competent to believe that the Palestinians could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope to win and too aware that Israel could easily defeat any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believable Arab coalition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet he has obviously worked assiduously in ensuring that this war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurs, even though, rationally, it will almost certainly cost him -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and most of his personal supporters - their lives, and his allies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their immediate political power. So we should assume that he intends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this outcome, and I very much doubt that he intends this as a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gesture. I think that he intends to win the greater war. So, placing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves in his shoes, we ask how he can make that happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that the simplest answer is to peek over the border in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction of Pakistan, which bin Laden knows intimately well - and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knows that the US has long historical involvement with her. There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more Pashtan in Pakistan than there are in Afghanistan. While the base
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of like-believers in Pakistan is unlikely to greatly exceed 10% in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general population. Now let us learn a little lesson from other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurgencies - for example that instigated in Afghanistan by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans. A similar ratio within the population sufficed, once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adequately agitated, to draw the USSR into the fray, as unless they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had entered it, their puppet government would have fallen. A decade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latter, after massive oppression of the population, and continuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agitprop, and the Russians withdrew in dismay leaving Afghanistan to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the not very tender mercies of that original 10%. And the US went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could this happen in Pakistan? I would argue that it already is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Repression of &quot;popular demonstrations&quot; are already occurring, with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequent perception in the populace that the secular government is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; siding with the &quot;evil&quot; US against the &quot;good&quot; Muslims - and drawing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every Muslim that wishes to be &quot;good&quot; into the fray, increasing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tempo and seriousness of riots. Rumors of disloyalty, disseminated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the command structure are causing the rapid purging of key staff,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generating a hard-core opposition to General Musharraf.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two key differences between Afghanistan and Pakistan exist. Once we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examine Pakistan's forces, we know that the number of Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentalists in Pakistan's forces exceeds 30% of the total muster.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And we know that Pakistan has an arsenal of possibly 30 nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons. There are a number of possible outcomes, to this battle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One might be that the fundamentalists succeed in taking over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country - and her nuclear arsenal. Which might lead to any number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting outcomes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somebody (Israel, India, U.S., C.I.S., R.O.C.) might preemptively nuke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pakistan - which will trigger uprisings throughout the Arab world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another is that the nukes could be deployed against Israel, the US or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; India.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any of these possibilities carries a far greater threat to the US than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Middle-East, largely because we and our historical opponents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still have vast arrays of nuclear weapons arrayed against one another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - and one detonation may well lead to another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another scenario has the US marching in to assist the Government of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pakistan - and that would absolutely require committing troops to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground involvement (air warfare, no matter how precise, is ineffective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against insurgents unless you simply intend to &quot;kill them all&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The above could well lead to a war of attrition that would destabilize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US and probably cause her to withdraw from global interaction -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly as this would also cause a ripple effect of insurrectionn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amongst other Arab states. And in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, the US would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost certainly be forced to intervene or abandon the Gulf.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, the fear of terrorism, and sufficient successes to keep the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US off balance, angry and repressing her own populace will guarantee a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large group calling for a cessation of hostilities and the &quot;politics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hunger&quot; will provide the material required to ensure the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectiveness of cassette tapes, announcing the death toll &quot;due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America's War on Islam&quot; which will take effect early next year. If I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am correct in even a fraction of this, every existing Middle Eastern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government, from Aden to Yemen, should be trembling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the US deploys against other countries, the destabilizing effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be multiplied. If Israel, isolated and driven into a corner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should come under attack, and use her nukes - as she almost certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would if she were subjected to an NBC attack, the Middle East will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explode. The probability of this will increase as Hamas and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incite more and more vociferous protests, designed to reduce common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense, already absent in her PM, completely out of the window. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tragedy is that I don't see a way, under the current leadership, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent this scenario from unfolding. Meanwhile, the global economies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are already unraveling, the cost of oil set to soar, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likelihood is that the climate will continue to cool, fuelling demands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for energy at exactly the time when it can least be met.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Possible? Likely? If anything, I suspect that this scenario is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimistic. I haven't been thinking about it for the last ten years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I am not fuelled by a passionate hatred of the West.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
