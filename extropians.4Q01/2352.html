War Support Ebbs Worldwide
<br>
<p>By Kevin Sullivan
<br>
<p><p>MEXICO CITY -- It was a traditional altar for Mexico's Day of the Dead
<br>
observance, filled with flowers, candles and sweet bread laid out for
<br>
departed loved ones. Except this one also featured bagels and photos of New
<br>
York, and it sat next to the U.S. Embassy here as a show of solidarity with
<br>
the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks.
<br>
<p>Mexicans who showed up to inaugurate the display made clear their sympathy
<br>
for the dead in the United States. But they also made clear that sympathy
<br>
did not necessarily translate into support for the U.S. war in Afghanistan.
<br>
&quot;I think the government of President Bush has gone too far; the war
<br>
frightens me,&quot; said Guadalupe Loaeza, a columnist and social commentator who
<br>
helped organize the altar display.
<br>
<p>Such views seem to be increasingly widespread around the world. The initial
<br>
outburst of solidarity after Sept. 11 has frayed considerably as U.S.
<br>
warplanes bomb Afghanistan relentlessly for the fifth week running. This is
<br>
true not only in Arab and other Muslim countries, where the U.S. military
<br>
campaign has provoked popular outrage, but in other countries where people
<br>
feel less of a direct connection to the events.
<br>
<p>In opinion polls and interviews in several countries in Africa, Asia, Latin
<br>
America and Europe, many people who said they were horrified by the Sept. 11
<br>
attacks added that the horror then does not justify the bombing of
<br>
Afghanistan now -- even if their governments continue to back the U.S.
<br>
campaign. In a war that Bush has described as a battle between good and
<br>
evil, many said it is not so simple.
<br>
<p>A poll taken this week for France 3 television and France Info radio, for
<br>
instance, showed support among the French for the U.S. military campaign has
<br>
dropped to 51 percent, down from 66 percent shortly after the bombing began
<br>
Oct. 7. Support also has declined in Germany, where polls show more than 65
<br>
percent of respondents now want the U.S. attacks to end, and in Spain, where
<br>
a poll for Cadena SER radio showed 69 percent of those surveyed want the
<br>
bombing to stop.
<br>
<p>Even in Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair has become a cheerleader
<br>
for the U.S. campaign, popular support for the bombing has begun to slip,
<br>
sinking from 74 percent soon after the attacks in Afghanistan began to 62
<br>
percent in a poll conducted last week.
<br>
<p>The views of Xu Maomao, 31, a human resources manager in Beijing who
<br>
attended a candlelight vigil in late September to mourn the U.S. victims,
<br>
typify the evolution of public opinion in many countries: &quot;I supported the
<br>
military strikes at first, but now I don't know what to say,&quot; she said. &quot;I
<br>
keep hearing about the lack of electricity in Afghanistan, or civilians and
<br>
children being killed. But only once in a while is there anything about a
<br>
terrorist base being hit. With all that high technology, can't the United
<br>
States do better?&quot;
<br>
<p>The Chinese government still supports Washington, but popular support seems
<br>
to have weakened as more bombs have fallen. The government has offered
<br>
strong endorsement of the fight against terrorism and cautious support for
<br>
the U.S. military campaign, but it has done little to rally the public
<br>
behind the cause.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think the United States has been too harsh and unreasonable,&quot; said Tong
<br>
Zhifan, 22. &quot;It's big and powerful, and it doesn't care how others feel. You
<br>
can't behave like that. Isn't that why America was attacked?&quot;
<br>
<p>In Russia, President Vladimir Putin's strong backing of the bombing campaign
<br>
muted most criticism at first. But in recent weeks, many Russians seem to
<br>
have developed doubts about the U.S. venture into a country known as the
<br>
Soviet Union's Vietnam. One poll this week found 46 percent of respondents
<br>
convinced that the United States will fail.
<br>
<p>In the aftermath of Sept. 11, there were outpourings of public sympathy in
<br>
Moscow, including huge mounds of flowers, teddy bears and traditional
<br>
Russian icons piled up outside the U.S. Embassy. But that has not
<br>
necessarily translated into public support for the bombing.
<br>
<p>With the new war in Afghanistan unfolding uncomfortably close to Russia's
<br>
southern border, concerns range from practical complaints about U.S.
<br>
military tactics to longer-term fears about the new American presence in
<br>
Russia's Central Asian sphere of influence. Some fear that the United States
<br>
will drop bombs, then walk away from Afghanistan, leaving Russia to deal
<br>
with a mess in its back yard.
<br>
<p>&quot;With every day, the Americans and the world public are increasingly
<br>
doubtful about the efficiency of U.S. actions,&quot; said Vladimir Lukin, deputy
<br>
speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament. While Russia remains a
<br>
willing participant in the anti-terrorist alliance, he warned, &quot;the
<br>
possibility of difficulties cropping up within the coalition itself is
<br>
growing because the U.S. does not offer what is usually called the light at
<br>
the end of the tunnel.&quot;
<br>
<p>Misgivings are growing among close allies as well.
<br>
<p>&quot;The basic pro-American sentiment is still there, but there is growing
<br>
unease because of the reports of the women and the children being killed,&quot;
<br>
said Tim Pat Coogan, a prominent Irish author and historian who lives in
<br>
Dublin.
<br>
<p>Coogan said that many Irish think the United States did not give enough
<br>
thought to the long-term political future of Afghanistan before starting the
<br>
military campaign. &quot;They seem to have bombed first and worried about the
<br>
political alliances afterward,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;People here know that many of the scenes of horror and civilian casualties
<br>
are Taliban propaganda,&quot; Coogan said. &quot;But we've heard so much about elite
<br>
troops and smart bombs and modern electronic devices -- where are they? The
<br>
Americans seem to be making a mess of their campaign. Sometimes it makes you
<br>
shake your head in despair and think of Vietnam.&quot;
<br>
<p>Here in Mexico, an increasingly close U.S. ally and a country that has
<br>
traditionally stayed out of international disputes, President Vicente Fox is
<br>
walking a political tightrope by supporting the U.S. military effort. He and
<br>
his top advisers have been blasted by critics who say that Mexico should
<br>
support only peaceful, diplomatic solutions to international conflicts.
<br>
<p>Pedro Reyes Linares, a leader of Mexican labor and community groups, said
<br>
the United States should have turned to international courts, not bombs. He
<br>
said the U.S. effort resulted from typical American impatience.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's clearly not a war between good and evil,&quot; he said. &quot;The impression is
<br>
that there are other motives behind the war. It's not just hunting down the
<br>
terrorists, but achieving greater control in a strategic area with rich
<br>
resources, and the possibility of exploiting oil and minerals.&quot;
<br>
<p>Criticism of the United States has even shown up on the radio in Mexican
<br>
folk songs known as &lt;em&gt;corridos&lt;/em&gt;. One song, &quot;The Mistake of the CIA,&quot;
<br>
goes, in part: &quot;They are looking for you, bin Laden, the terrorist that the
<br>
CIA trained, that was the biggest mistake of the American government.&quot;
<br>
<p>Farther south, the media in Argentina and Brazil have focused increasingly
<br>
on civilian casualties in Afghanistan, fueling already strong anti-American
<br>
sentiment. Bin Laden has emerged as a symbol of anti-Americanism among
<br>
Brazil's leftist and anarchist youth. His photo now shows up at rallies
<br>
alongside local favorites such as Fidel Castro and Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara.
<br>
<p>Members of two of the main soccer clubs in Rio de Janeiro have worn bin
<br>
Laden T-shirts to games and unfurled bin Laden flags when their team scored
<br>
a goal. Bin Laden has also become an underground hero among the street gangs
<br>
that rule Rio's hillside ghettos. Already resentful of the U.S. war on
<br>
drugs, they see bin Laden as a symbol of power and resistance to the United
<br>
States. The paper bags of cocaine selling for $1 each in Rio's ghettos have
<br>
bin Laden's image stamped on them and sport new names such as &quot;Taliban
<br>
Cocaine.&quot;
<br>
<p>In South Africa, sympathy for the United States has turned to scorn with
<br>
reports of Afghan civilian casualties.
<br>
<p>&quot;I do not understand the arrogance of the Americans,&quot; said Siphiwe Moerane,
<br>
a graphics designer sitting in a Johannesburg coffee shop. &quot;How do you wage
<br>
war against an entire country to get one man? We were all sorry to see the
<br>
loss of so many American lives on September 11. But why do Americans seem to
<br>
think that their lives are more valuable than lives outside their borders?
<br>
This is what makes people so angry at the U.S.&quot;
<br>
<p>Many Africans, who empathize with Afghanistan's impoverished population,
<br>
also hear echoes of colonialism and racism in the U.S. and British attacks.
<br>
Many Africans still hold a grudge against the British for their colonial
<br>
role in Africa. And they recall bitterly Washington's support for such
<br>
despots as the late Mobutu Sese Seku of Zaire, warlords such as Angola's
<br>
Jonas Savimbi and South Africa's apartheid-era white-minority government.
<br>
<p>&quot;No one in his right mind can defend the gruesome murder of innocent
<br>
children and the elderly in pursuit of one man whose guilt cannot be proved
<br>
beyond doubt,&quot; Garth le Pere, director of the Institute for Global Dialogue,
<br>
told reporters in Johannesburg.
<br>
<p>&quot;It simply means that America has no regard for innocent lives lost in other
<br>
parts of the world,&quot; said Sipho Seepe, a South African political analyst.
<br>
&quot;For them the concept of innocent lives lost applies to situations where
<br>
white and people of Western origin are involved. When it is black people's
<br>
lives or those of people of Indian origin, the concept does not apply.&quot;
<br>
<p>Public support in Kenya for the U.S. campaign appears to be holding firm,
<br>
despite a demonstration in the heavily Muslim port city of Mombasa that
<br>
turned into a riot. That incident was at least matched in the public
<br>
consciousness by the unprecedented spectacle of President Daniel arap Moi
<br>
leading a march supporting the United States in the aftermath of the
<br>
attacks. And Kenyans still remember vividly the 1998 terrorist bombing of
<br>
the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi that killed 207 Kenyans and 12 Americans.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm supporting it definitely, since the Americans are trying to attack the
<br>
terrorists, not Islam,&quot; said John Ngagna, 19, a student. &quot;They're not
<br>
fighting the religion, they're fighting those responsible. Kenyans
<br>
understand that.&quot;
<br>
<p>Elsewhere as well, public support is still strong. In Canada, a poll last
<br>
week found that 74 percent of people surveyed support the war in
<br>
Afghanistan. Rudyard Griffiths, executive director of the Dominion
<br>
Institute, a Toronto charity that promotes the study of history in schools,
<br>
said Prime Minister Jean Chretien deserves much of the credit because he did
<br>
not raise false expectations of a short war.
<br>
<p>&quot;The result is, Canadians are more reconciled with complexities we entered
<br>
into,&quot; Griffiths said.
<br>
<p>&quot;I am proud to have such a close association with the United States,&quot; said
<br>
Joe Warmington, 36, a Canadian who writes a column for the Toronto Sun
<br>
called Night Scrawler. &quot;I think we should be where Great Britain is; we
<br>
should be the first off the block.&quot;
<br>
<p>In Japan, which has clung to pacifism since the U.S. atomic bombings of
<br>
Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, polls show that most
<br>
people either support the bombing of Afghanistan or see it as unavoidable.
<br>
Support for military action has actually increased, from a range of 42 to 52
<br>
percent just before the airstrikes began to a range of 57 to 83 percent in
<br>
the past two weeks.
<br>
<p>The popular prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, pushed for and won passage of
<br>
a bill on Oct. 29 allowing Japan to send its military outside the nation's
<br>
territorial waters to give logistical support to U.S. troops. Analysts
<br>
describe the government as eager to avoid a repeat of the Persian Gulf War
<br>
experience, when Japan was criticized for offering financial assistance but
<br>
little military support.
<br>
<p>Asked about the bombing of Afghanistan, Yoshihito Nakagawa, a 46-year-old
<br>
architect, said Japan had to be involved and support the United States. &quot;For
<br>
now, it's the only way,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>But Japan's deep pacifist streak is still evident. Yoshiaki Nagashima, 59,
<br>
dug out photographs of Afghanistan he took in 1978 and exhibited them this
<br>
week at a small gallery in Tokyo -- photos of children laughing and smiling.
<br>
When the airstrikes began, he said, &quot;I felt the egotism of the superpower.&quot;

<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&quot;We have met the enemy and he is us.&quot;
