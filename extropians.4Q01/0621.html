<p>An interesting question. I think I would come down on the yes side. I
<br>
can imagine the use of embargoing information for a while, but who gets
<br>
to decide on for how long? If that decision is not possible to appeal,
<br>
then it becomes possible for information-embargoing groups to
<br>
control information just as if they were doing actual censorship, simply
<br>
by putting an extremely long embargo on the information. Once you start
<br>
circumscribing freedom of information - even in the best interest of
<br>
many people - you allow further, just as reasonable, decreases in
<br>
freedom of information. Banning certain media can limit the flow of
<br>
information tremendously, and if new media are not automatically given
<br>
freedom then the effective freedom of information might decrease - in
<br>
many countries you may have the right to write what you want on paper or
<br>
in letters, but if it at any point becomes digital it is suddely not
<br>
free.
<br>
<p>### How about allowing for time-limited embargoes on certain specific data
<br>
(not broad classes or media), if requested by a government agency, with the
<br>
initial period of secrecy granted by a judge? Once that time is over the
<br>
data must be placed in the public domain and a jury (or more precisely, a
<br>
group of adult citizens chosen randomly, not pre-selected by attorneys)
<br>
would decide if the embargo was placed in good faith, and if the agency
<br>
should be punished (by fines or restrictions on the use of secrecy).
<br>
<p>As long as the judicial system and the jury selection are not corrupt or
<br>
impotent, the system should work, offering benefits in conflicts with
<br>
entities disdainful of fair play, while avoiding harm to innocent
<br>
individuals. You are pointing to the slippery slope we might find ourselves
<br>
on if we allow *any* restriction on the freedom of information, and indeed
<br>
this is a risk, but a wide participation of the public (by way of the
<br>
juries) should be a good safeguard. If this fails, it means that the average
<br>
citizens (as selected for jury duty) no longer care about freedom of
<br>
expression - and in that case the society is doomed, no matter how good are
<br>
the written laws protecting this freedom.
