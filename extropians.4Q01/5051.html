</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You misunderstand what &quot;created equal&quot; is supposed to mean. You interpret the
<br>
statement in strictly biological terms, and then it of course becomes wrong.
<br>
But the writers of the above document did most certainly *not* think about
<br>
polymorphisms or skin color, they were basing this on *ethical* equality.
<br>
<p>Don't take it wrong, but your engineering perspective makes you miss a
<br>
reference that is glaringly obvious to anyone involved in philosophy,
<br>
especially political philosophy. Misunderstandings like this are a real
<br>
problem for us, since a lot of the formulations in the Extropian Principles
<br>
similarly has to be understood in terms of a long humanist and liberal
<br>
tradition. If you do not place them in a larger philosophicl context they do
<br>
not really make much sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The idea that we can all be considered &quot;equal&quot; is fundamentally flawed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What we should be striving for is enhancing inalienable rights,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that everyone has equal opportunities for &quot;Life, Liberty and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Pursuit of Happiness&quot; (as they define them).
</em><br>
<p>What they really talk about here is that every human has an equal inherent
<br>
human dignity, the inherent value of being a human being living a life on
<br>
one's own terms and with one's own goal. From this axiom follows inalienable
<br>
rights such as the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
<br>
<p>As for racism, devaluing somebody's dignity because of their genome or culture
<br>
is clearly against this concept of humans as self-developing, self-directing
<br>
goals in themselves. You can of course dislike a person or group of person
<br>
depending on what they do or think, but that should never remove the
<br>
recognition of their basic human dignity. Without it, all other rights quickly
<br>
come tumbling down and you end up in an unworkable ethics of might makes
<br>
right. Whether races really are useful semantic categories or not, and how
<br>
large differences we see between each others doesn't really matter, what
<br>
matters is the recognition that other humans have dignity and should be
<br>
allowed to live their lives.
