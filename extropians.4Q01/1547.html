<em>&gt; &gt;Hypothetically, what if there was a religion (not Islam, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hypothetical religion that doesn't exist at all in our timeline)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;diametrically opposed to the liberal, secular, rational, humanist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;egalitarian values. Would it be acceptable for us to regard this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;religion as a problem rather than as a valid point of view, much like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we regard bigotry and hatred as problems rather than as opinions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Have we arrived at a paradox?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some people (myself and J.R. Molloy included) *do* view religion as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem (if not *the* problem).  But the problem with that problem is how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with it in a &quot;liberal, secular, rational, humanist, egalitarian&quot; way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only way I see is by meme warfare.  But this is admittedly an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excrutiatingly slow way to wipe out theism.  Particularly since religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are like Chinese handcuffs.  The more you pull, the more resistant it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes. And the above descriptions are problematic in that it
<br>
assumes rationality, humanism, egalitarianism and so on are (a)
<br>
the only or best values to all reasonable beings and (b)
<br>
incompatible with all or some actual or hypothetical religions. 
<br>
I am surprised to see egalitarian on the list frankly since most
<br>
of us believe in things like equality relative to law or rights
<br>
but not actual equality of results, talents, value in particular
<br>
enterprises and so on.   The term &quot;liberal&quot; is subject to
<br>
endlessly fascinating vacillations of meaning.  The term
<br>
&quot;humanist&quot; is often extended to mean strongly materialistic and
<br>
even is seen by some proponents to deny any real validity to
<br>
spirituality from the beginning.  If so then it begs the
<br>
question straight away by being included.  
<br>
<p>In a society with reasonable tolerance of differing opinions and
<br>
worldviews we don't have quite these conversations in my view.
