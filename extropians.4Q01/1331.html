Delivered, sure, but _read_? Efficiently?
<br>
<p>Remaining problem: overall, screens still suck. One can speed read _clean_ paper 
<br>
(not talking about low res faxes here) considerably faster than one can speed read a screen.
<br>
This is well substantiated by research done at Xerox PARC, MIT Media Lab and elsewhere.
<br>
If one is in the business of dealing with lots of mail, there will be a huge productivity
<br>
hit if one is limited to 72-100 dpi screens for reading.
<br>
<p>Get me one of those new copper-matrix IBM flat-panels, and I might be able to tolerate 
<br>
reading paper mail that's been scanned. AFAIK, they're not in mass production yet.
