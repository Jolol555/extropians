Silent sensors lie in wait for bin Laden
<br>

<br>
Hi-tech sensors scattered over the mountains and valleys of Afghanistan will
<br>
be playing a key part in tracking down Osama Bin Laden.
<br>
<p>The devices lie silent, watching for movement, heat, vibrations and other
<br>
signals of activity and then report to airplanes or satellites above. This
<br>
allows good surveillance of large areas and, crucially, a rapid response.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sensors are becoming increasingly important in intelligence gathering
<br>
operations and it is safe to assume that they will be deployed in
<br>
Afghanistan,&quot; says John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.Org, a military think
<br>
tank based in Alexandria, Virginia. &quot;However, these devices will often be used
<br>
by special forces personnel, so details will be classified.&quot;
<br>
<p>Importantly, he says: &quot;Measurement sensors are hard to hide from. As winter
<br>
moves in, infra-red detection becomes easier - warm air from ventilation
<br>
shafts in bunkers show up real well. And how do you fool seismic sensors that
<br>
can detect and distinguish vibrations from the movement of jeeps, people or
<br>
horses?&quot;
<br>
<p>Caves and tunnels
<br>
US forces are searching for bin Laden and members of the al-Qaida network,
<br>
which the US holds responsible for the terrorist atrocities of 11 September.
<br>
Reports of their whereabouts are contradictory, but they are thought to be
<br>
hiding in the caves and tunnels that riddle parts of Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>A reward of $25 million has been offered and the US hopes the wanted men can
<br>
be located using intelligence from anti-Taliban forces or mercenaries,
<br>
combined with data from their own special forces and sensors, aircraft and
<br>
satellites.
<br>
<p>&quot;If he moves, we spot him,&quot; a Pentagon official told Time. &quot;If he doesn't
<br>
move, we close in on him, cave by cave.&quot;
<br>
<p>The US has made clear that its personnel will not enter heavily defended caves
<br>
to capture or kill bin Laden. Why risk casualties, another Pentagon official
<br>
said, &quot;when we've got 50,000 opposition fighters on the ground who are willing
<br>
to do it?&quot; Other options are to use &quot;bunker buster&quot; bombs to penetrate
<br>
strongholds, or fuel-air explosion devices to attack those inside.
<br>
<p>Sensor to shooter
<br>
A key purpose of small Unattended Ground Sensors (UGSs) is to reduce what the
<br>
military call &quot;sensor to shooter time&quot;, i.e. the time delay between gathering
<br>
intelligence and acting on it. This is particularly crucial when targets are
<br>
small or highly mobile. A number of reports suggest bin Laden and Taliban
<br>
leaders have narrowly escaped US attacks that followed intelligence reports.
<br>
<p>The UGSs can be buried by ground forces or camouflaged and dropped from the
<br>
air. They lie in wait for the enemy and report any activity using a
<br>
combination of seismic, acoustic, infra-red, optical and magnetic
<br>
technologies. It is this real time data that speeds up the decision making
<br>
process.
<br>
<p>The newest generation of sensor arrays benefit from advances in computer
<br>
processor speed and software design. This means these distributed systems can
<br>
be networked together by secure radio link to provide real-time information,
<br>
often by via satellite. The data may then be relayed to a nearby soldier's
<br>
laptop, or via several repeater units to a command post some distance away.
<br>
<p>Psychological edge
<br>
Networks of several arrays of UGSs usefully permit the monitoring of the
<br>
direction and speed of movement. For example, sudden, unexplained changes in
<br>
activity along routes could suggest the location of unknown bases.
<br>
<p>UGSs also have a psychological edge. Even if some are discovered, the enemy
<br>
will not know if they have found them all or to what extent their activities
<br>
have been compromised.
<br>
<p>Pike does sound a note of caution, though: &quot;Although sensors can help, no one
<br>
should imagine that tracking down small groups of individuals hiding in
<br>
difficult terrain is easy. It's a tough job, but it can be done.&quot;
