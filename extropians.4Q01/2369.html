<em>&gt; While people do worry about scenarios where superintelligent grey goo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the stars eats humanity, the most powerful impact is with the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that within a few years you *must* get yourself a better brain in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to avoid becoming poor and powerless. That slots neatly into a lot of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistance to our projects. To worsen things, most people are used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologies that prescribe the same behavior for all humans, and do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept the idea that other humans may have other goals.
</em><br>
<p>The real answer here is simply &quot;Are these technologies self-replicating?&quot; 
<br>
Non-self-replicating technologies will likely be expensive and limited to
<br>
the First World, at least at first.  Self-replicating technologies are not
<br>
expensive unless an enforceable patent exists.  Genetic engineering is
<br>
self-replicating but patented.  Software is self-replicating but
<br>
unenforceably copyrighted.  Nanotechnology is self-replicating at
<br>
sufficiently advanced levels.  Intelligence enhancement technology is
<br>
&quot;self-replicating&quot; if there's even one philanthropist among the enhanced,
<br>
although it may take a while for that process to complete.  And the
<br>
nanotech-plus-Friendly-SI scenario is not only self-replicating, it
<br>
bypasses the existing economic system completely.
<br>
<p>I think that's the counterslogan:  &quot;Posthumanity will bypass the existing
<br>
economic system and offer everyone the same opportunities.&quot;  Then you have
<br>
to argue it.  But it makes a good opening line.
