<p>The actual text JR posted was that it can monitor phone conversations,
<br>
which it can do for any network that uses any sort of wireless or RF
<br>
inducing segment in it's backbone. It can monitor cell phone
<br>
communications, wireless phone communications, and any hard wire phone
<br>
conversation that has a booster or load coil in the circuit between
<br>
conversants. The 100'+ diameter antenna of the KH-11 sigint variant
<br>
focuses in on locations of load coils (on the phone pole or at the local
<br>
switch/router) to grab induced RF signals.
<br>
<p>Of course, it can't always monitor all the communications of an entire
<br>
country at a time, just those passing through its focal zone. The
<br>
antenna utilizes 'whispering chamber' methods to focus very tightly on
<br>
RF sources. 
<br>
<p>This method was first experimented with in 1966 by classified Gemini
<br>
missions in conjuction with the prototype MOL launch. While the public
<br>
purpose of the launch was to 'test' the thru-heatshield hatchway of the
<br>
new Gemini B capsule that was to be used with the MOL system, the MOL
<br>
prototype was accompanied on its launch with three microsatellites whose
<br>
purpose was to test this concept of focusing in on RF sources in 3
<br>
dimensions. Declassified documents state that these sats and the MOL
<br>
were performing whispering gallery experiments. 
<br>
<p>The state of the art in recon sat technology at the time had developed
<br>
first with photographic systems the ability to visually focus on
<br>
stationary surface targets while passing over at orbital speeds and
<br>
altitudes. Similar methods are used to gather and transmit real time
<br>
sigint data. Covert teams using burst transmissions are able to transmit
<br>
and receive at very low power levels with this technology as well that
<br>
provides more than just line of sight communications, the whispering
<br>
gallery method is truly a point to point system for any but the most
<br>
sensitive and sophisticated of eavesdroppers.
