Eliezer recently said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Freeloading may increase total unfairness, but it still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases wealth. Downloading always increases wealth.
</em><br>
<p>I objected to similar comments earlier.  I don't understand
<br>
the way Eliezer is using the term &quot;wealth&quot;, which the
<br>
dictionary defines as &quot;much money or property; riches&quot;
<br>
and &quot;valuable products, contents, etc.&quot;.
<br>
<p>If I download an MP3 file once I may be wealthier.
<br>
If I download the same MP3 file a second time and
<br>
save it in a different file, I'm probably poorer
<br>
(having lost disk space) rather than wealthier.
<br>
If I download an MP3 file that turns out to be junk
<br>
I'm also poorer as well (having spent my time to
<br>
get something of lesser value that what that time
<br>
was worth).  So I disagree with the statement that
<br>
&quot;Downloading *always* increases wealth&quot;.
<br>
<p>While there is some discussion regarding tipping I haven't
<br>
seen any comments that question whether &quot;freeloading&quot;
<br>
leads to a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; (I commented on
<br>
it a little bit in response to the idea of getting rid
<br>
of patents).
<br>
<p>I think Spike comments may be right -- that freeloading
<br>
might ultimately spell the death of certain bands in
<br>
which case it seems that at least some &quot;potential&quot; wealth
<br>
may be lost.  Whether that will be balanced by tipping
<br>
from fans to bands we would never of heard of because
<br>
they didn't fit some producer's idea of what would sell
<br>
remains to be seen.
<br>
<p>I know the Javien folks are working on a micropayment
<br>
system.  With PayPal being bought out (or selling out)
<br>
the question will be whether enough groups get it together
<br>
to allow tipping to occur using something like the Javien
<br>
software.  It seems logical that what is needed is a
<br>
enhanced-MP3 format that would point you at the sites
<br>
and allow you to do the tipping.  As I said previously
<br>
you want to make the barriers for this really low
<br>
(e.g. the software asks me to do my tipping once a
<br>
week or once a month based on my playlist records).
<br>
I seem to have heard of there being &quot;tipping&quot; sites that
<br>
already exist -- have any of them tied into players yet?
<br>
<p>One could &quot;educate&quot; the poor teenagers or college
<br>
students that &quot;payback&quot; is necessary to avoid a
<br>
tragedy of the commons.  If the software kept a
<br>
decade long history of songs played, these individuals
<br>
could tip at some future time when they are able
<br>
to afford to do so.
<br>
