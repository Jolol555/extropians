<p>
Rafal,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as someone who will have to compete
<br>
with your skills in the open market in the next few years,
<br>
your prescence in the country is nothing I'm losing
<br>
sleep over.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a European immigrant who is highly educated
<br>
and brings valuable skills to the Republic... you are
<br>
highly atypical.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is not set up to deliberately lure you and
<br>
those like you to America. This is a pity. Insofar as
<br>
America needs influx we need people who say
<br>
&lt;As an immigrant I represent a clear gain for the American society. &gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I suspect you did not come across
<br>
the border and insist on affirmative action, state-funded
<br>
education for your children in the tongue of your
<br>
birthland etc. You hit the shore and started jumping
<br>
through hoops to take and pass the boards and
<br>
practice your art.
<br>
&lt;The question of regulating immigration can best be solved to the benefit of
<br>
the American nation by an impartial economic analysis aiming to optimize the
<br>
gains and reduce the losses due to immigration, both of which can be
<br>
measured. &gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly. I would also add that it is strongly in America's best interest
<br>
to solicit such immigrants favourably who will maintain the
<br>
historic ethnic proportions that are associated with our country.
<br>
We should solicit immigration from populations who have
<br>
historically grounded their cultures in order and stable
<br>
high trust societies.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should NOT be importing a welfare class to compete
<br>
with and compound our own problems with homegrown
<br>
ethnic problem groups.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, if you are a physican, or someone the country
<br>
can use, where you are from is irrelevant. But if not... then
<br>
we should not import poverty and then subsidize it by
<br>
declining to maintain the cultural matrix.
<br>
<p><p>Good luck doc,
<br>
Brian
