</em><br>
<p>While arguing over whether terrorists are cowardly, we must
<br>
keep in mind that the &quot;coward&quot; meme is one that evolved in order
<br>
to encourage people to behave in a certain way.  {Look at the
<br>
word I just used, &quot;encourage&quot; meaning exhort or motivate.}
<br>
<p>We are raised with the notion that cowardly is bad, courageous
<br>
is good.  Look at children's books and see how very many
<br>
reinforcements there are for this.  Having this handle allows
<br>
society to control the way people behave, especially young men:
<br>
go out on that field where people are shooting at you, so you wont
<br>
be thought a coward, etc, red badge of courage, etc.  Let us see
<br>
this meme for what it is, a behavior control meme analogous in
<br>
many ways to the religion meme that also is often used as a means
<br>
to control the behavior of the proletariat.  spike
<br>
<p>Samantha, I apologize in advance: that last comment was in
<br>
no way aimed at you.  {8-]  s
