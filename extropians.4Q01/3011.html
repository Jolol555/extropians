<p><em>&gt; &gt; Just perhaps, branding someone or some nation as utterly evil,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evil exists.  Therefore calling someone evil /when they are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fact, evil/, is the only sane and rational thing to do.  Calling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them evil when they are not is indeed irrational.  That's why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational thought is important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Evil exists.  There are evil ideas, policies and actions. 
<br>
Branding a person themselves evil is something else again in my
<br>
thinking.  The first puts one in an effort to oppose and if
<br>
possible nullify and replace ideas, policies and actions.  The
<br>
second calls for the labelling of a person or nation as utterly
<br>
hopeless evil and requiring destruction.  The second
<br>
dehumanizes.  With the first it is sometimes even possible to
<br>
show the committer of evil actions the error of their ways and
<br>
play on their good aspects to have them help in stopping the
<br>
evil actions.  The second denies their are any good aspects to
<br>
reach.  See the difference?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  When the &quot;other&quot; is &quot;evil&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the temptation is to believe that one's own group must be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;good&quot; and that any who point out where that just isn't so are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves &quot;evil&quot;.   Both sides are dehumanized by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process.  Truth is the first casualty of war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, that too is a bad thing.  A's being evil does not in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way imply that B is good, even if B calls A evil, and B disagrees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with everything A says.  Anyone who believes this is irrational,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and such bad arguments need to be pointed out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Epistemology matters.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  As does understanding and even empathy/compassion.
