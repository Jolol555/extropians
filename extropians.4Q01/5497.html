<em>&gt; &gt; I agree that if any company in the world has a motivation to fund such work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it would be West; but your employer has been notoriously slow to adopt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technological innovation -- perhaps because of their long history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; monopoly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Monopoly tends to oppose technological innovation only to the extent that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopoly does not *need* technological innovation in order to continue to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend itself. For example, Microsoft (or some other company) could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceivably develop automated jurisprudence software, patent it, and have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopoly. To defend that monopoly, Microsoft (or West Legal Group, MS Software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Division) may then develop cutting-edge and innovative technology in the form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of lawyer-bots and human-competitive expert systems that could win in court.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, would WLG want to bury the Singularity, or own it? I think they (or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; borganized future group) are already well on the way to owning it.
</em><br>
<p>As someone who works for them, I most emphatically disagree that WLG as
<br>
it stands today is any closer than we are to &quot;owning&quot; the Singularity.
<br>
They have zero concept of AI, their internal processes are still
<br>
extremely human-to-human - to the extent that it is a tough battle
<br>
simply getting them to commit to that most basic of engineering
<br>
requirements: written specifications, and their concerns are throughly
<br>
removed from the world of actual physical production except insofar as
<br>
it adds to the cost of printing stuff (so, no nanotech or other
<br>
materials development research is possible for them for now).
<br>
<p>You forget: they think they own the law.  The only defense they believe
<br>
they need is the legal system itself, and they believe they are
<br>
sufficiently defended by it against all comers, now and forever.  (No
<br>
matter how good a lawyer is, when the law is clear and explicit on a
<br>
certain matter and the facts are known well enough, the outcome tends to
<br>
be predetermined.  Which is kind of the point of laws.)
