<p>Samantha, did you or did you not look at the link I posted to the
<br>
Revolutionary Association of Women of Aghanistan or not?
<br>
<a href="http://www.rawa.org/">http://www.rawa.org/</a>
<br>
<p>You'll note that they disagree with the tactics the US is undertaking
<br>
just as you do. They view *both* the US-backed Northern Alliance and
<br>
the Taliban as hated occupiers. But, they've lived under Shariya law,
<br>
and they've had enough of it. They understand that becoming an
<br>
apologist for Muslim fundamentalism is not the right way to criticize
<br>
the US. Now read their site, look at their photos of what Islamic
<br>
fundamentalists have done to their country, and then rethink your
<br>
uncompromising defense of these misogynistic primitive cave-dwelling
<br>
Talibastards.
<br>
<p>The world is not black and white, Samantha. Just because we're
<br>
bastards doesn't mean the other side are the good guys. Whether or not
<br>
Bin Laden 'did it', whether or not the Taliban is culpable, they are a
<br>
mistake the CIA made and the people of the region have been suffering
<br>
because of. Now it's time to undo CIA's mistake and perhaps undo the
<br>
CIA afterward (I'm sure there will be too many entrenched interests
<br>
opposing *that* though I'd damn sure vote for it if the gov bothered
<br>
to ask me).
<br>
<p>- -- 
<br>
* I believe that the majority of the world's Muslims are good,      *
<br>
* honorable people. If you are a Muslim and want to reassure me and *
<br>
* others that you are part of this good, honorable majority, all    *
<br>
* you need to say are nine simple words: &quot;I OPPOSE the Wahhabi cult *
<br>
* and its Jihad.&quot;                                                   *
