<p><em>    &gt;I have seen almost no signs that the US  is willing to admit to the abusees
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;that have led in part to the atmosphere under which various forms of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;extremism flourish in the Middle East. [...] I also think we are lying in that
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;we are not admitting where we  contribute to terror directly and indirectly.
</em><br>
<p>Ok let me get this straight,  barbarians crash two American airliners into the two
<br>
largest American office buildings in the world and the first think Americans should
<br>
do is apologies to the poor misunderstood terrorists for forcing them to take such
<br>
unpleasant action. That doesn't sound quite right now does it.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;is it the plan to pressure and if necessary attack up to 60 countries looking for this network
</em><br>
<p>One of those 60 countries that contain terrorist cells is the USA and I don't believe
<br>
there are many who plan to invade ourselves. There are about a half dozen countries
<br>
that are hard core supporters of terrorism and after they see what happened to
<br>
Afghanistan I have a hunch they will be far less hard core.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; We could not even defeat the Vietcong
</em><br>
<p>The Vietcong were well supplied from the outside world, that is not the case with
<br>
Afghanistan, the supplies they have right now are all they are going to have. Also,
<br>
most Americans, myself included, did not understand why the hell we were fighting
<br>
in Vietnam, this time the reason we are fighting is as obvious as an elephant at a
<br>
ballet to all but a tiny percentage such as yourself.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I think we are dishonest and/or heartless  when we say that the 600,000
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;children that have died in Iraq as  the result of our bombing and blockades
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;are reasonable
</em><br>
<p>Yes, so we hear from Mr. Chomsky and organizations he admires, I would be most
<br>
interested to hear of the methodology used to obtain that figure, I'm sure Mr. Chomsky
<br>
or any competent scientist would never dream of calculating that number from data
<br>
provided by the government of Iraq as they just might not be considered an impartial
<br>
observer. But no matter, if Iraq wants the blockade lifted then let back in observers to
<br>
make sure they are not making nuclear or biological weapons. If they don't want to do
<br>
that then let the UN in to distribute food directly to those who need it. Iraq has flatly
<br>
refused both approaches and yet America is the bad guy. Go figure.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I would be more gratified if we spent as long considering the implications and
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;dangerous of these new laws and the cost-benefit ratio of them as we spent
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;pouring over the sex life of Clinton.
</em><br>
<p>And while your committee agonizing over the cost-benefit ratio, the environmental
<br>
impact statement, and the minority hiring policy of the committee,  a case of Smallpox
<br>
has broken out, airliners are crashing into the Empire State Building, the Sears Tower,
<br>
and nuclear reactors.
