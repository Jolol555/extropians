<p>&quot;Both are you.  And both would probably make themselves unhappy worrying
<br>
about whether they themselves are &quot;you&quot;.  Worrying about copy versus
<br>
continuance may not make a lot of sense if both have ALL your memories and
<br>
subjective experience.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would disagree, if you separated the two beings they would not both
<br>
experience the same subjective things.  Therefore they are not the same
<br>
'being'  One of them was the original you, one is a copy, one had subjective
<br>
continuity of consciousness, the other has only the memory of subjectivity
<br>
continuity of consciousness.  Of course no test could ever be performed to
<br>
determine which one was the original, but it doesn't matter, as ONE of them
<br>
necessarily was, and experienced a subjective continuity of consciousness.  
<br>
<p>If the copying process was destructive, then the copy would not have
<br>
experienced a subjective continuity of consciousness, since if it wasn't
<br>
destructive, both the copy and the original would have separate and isolated
<br>
subjective experiences.  Therefore a copy is not a subjective continuation
<br>
of you.
