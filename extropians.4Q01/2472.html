From: &quot;Webb, Steve&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:swebb@asce.org?Subject=Re:%20Non-sensory%20experiences&In-Reply-To=&lt;02fc01c169fe$532f4120$4a5d2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">swebb@asce.org</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; If such an experience were strictly the result of, say, a flood of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hormones within the brain, I should be able to reproduce the experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply releasing these same hormones in the same amount.
</em><br>
<p>That *might* qualify as an emulation or phantasm of the experience, and it
<br>
*might* feel like a real experience. The only way to find out would be to
<br>
conduct the appropriate experiments. There is some evidence, from &quot;phantom
<br>
limb&quot; mirror experiments, that the brain can associate remembered sensory
<br>
events with nervous activity to produce the illusion of sensation. Amazingly,
<br>
the phantom limb sensation disappears when patients successfully imagine that
<br>
their phantom limbs are no longer attached.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Indeed, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is evidence that certain emotional states, particulary mystical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences, can be induced by low-level electromagnetic stimuli applied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the brain.  But something seems missing in the &quot;eureka!&quot; case --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would I have the experience that I'd just made some great discovery even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I wasn't thinking about anything in particular?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's called an emotional hallucination, and is not a real experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if we accept that &quot;government&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; are artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructs of sensory input, these concepts can apparently be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulated without further sensory input to produce new emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states, and even other such constructs.  I find the labeling of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructs and their manipulation-sans-input &quot;emotional hallucinations&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overly pejorative.  If these experiences can produce insights that may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be utilized in the external world, they are useful.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps so, and if these experiences can *not* produce insights that may be
<br>
utilized in the external world, then pejorative of sufficient potency to
<br>
dispel them are apropos.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So you are willing to accept that there can be experiences that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly associated with any *external* stimulus, whose direct cause is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal (e.g., discovering a conceptual association),
</em><br>
<p>Naturally, an internally generated sensory event is nonetheless a sensory
<br>
event. This in no way postulates the presence of &quot;non-sensory&quot; experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so long as we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not try to separate the internal cause from the resulting sensory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences?
</em><br>
<p>Separating causes from results is not at issue here. The term | sensory
<br>
experiences | is redundant, because there is no empirical evidence of any kind
<br>
of experience other than sensory ones. Experiences may involve one or several
<br>
sensory events, in combinatorial blends or as discrete inputs. Experiences
<br>
require sensation as (analogously) rainbows require color.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In that case there doesn't seem much to argue against.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know if the biofeedback resulting from an internal cognitive event
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be separated from the event, or even whether there's any point in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying.  But there remains, it seems to me, an important distinction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between internally- and externally-generated experiences.  I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was the point of labeling some experiences as &quot;non-sensory&quot; -- to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicate that their source was internal rather than external.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't think the point of (mis)labeling some experiences as &quot;non-sensory&quot;
<br>
is to indicate that they are generated internally (i.e., within the body). The
<br>
experience of a stomach ache is generated internally, but that doesn't make it
<br>
&quot;non-sensory.&quot; I think the point of mis-labeling some experiences as
<br>
&quot;non-sensory&quot; is to invoke supernatural causation, which can then be used to
<br>
advance further philosophical speculation. It is an unscientific (not to say
<br>
dishonest) tactic, and a subtle outcome of having deluded oneself.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
&quot;non-sensory&quot; experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
