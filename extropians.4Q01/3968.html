</em><br>

<em>&gt; truly suck).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has nothing to do with whether we live in a simulation, though.

<em>&gt; Because we're the measurement device measuring ourselves. A rather

<p>I don't think this impacts on Nick's arguments at all. Nowhere does he rely
<br>
on
<br>
any probability of intelligence arising based on observations of humanity
<br>
and
<br>
our relation to the natural universe. He merely depends on the fact that 
<br>
we do exist, irrespective of how, and that we can, or we think we can, do
<br>
certain things (like do strong AI).
<br>
<p>In fact, one of the most interesting things about his paper is the 
<br>
complete avoidance of territory covered by the anthropic principle.
