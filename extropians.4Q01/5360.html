<em>&gt;From: Kai Becker &lt;<a href="mailto:kmb@kai-m-becker.de?Subject=Re:%20some%20U.S.%20observations%20and%20notes&In-Reply-To=&lt;200112281454.GAA00137@well.com&gt;">kmb@kai-m-becker.de</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;First of all: I am sure that you're right about the USA, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think I am right about Germany. But my real question is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unanswered - and I think the answer _is_ important for this list:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even if the USA can only lower their highest crime rate in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;western world when all their citizens have guns (and I doubt this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because &quot;correlation is not causation&quot;), why do the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries have a rate four times lower _without_ this? There must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be other factors than guns, and for me, these are the important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factors.
</em><br>
<p><p>The way to lower the crime rate is to actually hold criminals
<br>
accountable for their own behavior. Something rarely practiced here
<br>
in the U.S.. 
<br>
<p>Even in the case of murder with a handgun, people repeatably give
<br>
evil intent to the inanimate chunk of metal rather than the
<br>
operator.
<br>
<p>Crime rate figures for the U.S. are skewed. I live in the Chicago
<br>
area and have for most of my adult life, no one has ever been
<br>
murdered in any neighborhood I've lived in, and crime is as rare as
<br>
any European city. Yet I could take you to neighborhoods where
<br>
someone was probably murdered yesterday and probably will be today.
<br>
<p><p>But don't take my word, look for yourself:
<br>

<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Firearms empower to what? To kill. I can't find this extropian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Like the proverb says: For some one with only a hammer, everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looks like a nail. Someone who has a gun has no need to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about better alternatives. Cf. the discussion about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no-alternatives situations...
</em><br>
<p><p>This is ridiculous and totally unsupportable. There are 80 million
<br>
armed Americans who find other solutions every day. Guns are a
<br>
weapon of last resort, but one you're damn glad to have when you
<br>
need it.
<br>
<p>If you don't wish to own guns don't, but you do not have the right
<br>
to tell me how I may chose to defend myself.
