Scerir aptly, quoted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Tom Stonier--[Information and the Internal Structure of the Universe, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springer- Verlag, London, 1990]
<br>
- information is a basic property of the universe, like matter and energy;
<br>
- the information contained by a system is a function of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;linkages binding simpler, into more complex units; &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Seems intuitive to Western Intellectual thought, so far! Stonier goes and...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; - the universe is organized into a hierarchy of information levels;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the universe may end up in a state in which all matter and energy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been converted into pure information.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My Reaction: Wow! Where and How are these information level stored???!!
<br>
&nbsp;They must have &quot;emerged&quot; as a production of natural selection, both 
<br>
biological and otherwise?
<br>
Did Stonier suggest that there is a process that converts matter and energy 
<br>
into information?
<br>
<p>Scerir quoting Shelly Goldstein:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Moreover, it would not be at all sensible for a theory to acknowledge that 
<br>
&quot;any statement about the world has to make reference to observation,'' 
<br>
since Zeilinger's assertion is plainly false. Statements about history are 
<br>
not 
<br>
statements about history books, and statements about dinosaurs are not 
<br>
statements about fossilized dinosaur bones.&gt;
<br>
- Shelly Goldstein &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Without picking a fight with Anton Zeilinger, I would argue with Goldstein, 
<br>
that tangentially, statements about History, can certainly be viewed on 
<br>
whether or not someone's' History Book was indeed, accurate. Or as we say in 
<br>
Ohio, &quot;where'd you go to school, in Kentucky?&quot;  Statements about dinosaurs, 
<br>
surely, relate to statements about dinosaur fossils. Paleontologists handle 
<br>
little else but fossilized bones. Occasionally someone outside the field, 
<br>
like Alvarez, can turn the topic on its ear, by viewing phenomena outside the 
<br>
box, as he did by studying chemical traces of iridium. 
<br>
<p>Information and how its manufactured, stored, and distributed, is still my 
<br>
nagging question, though.  I like to believe (against all odds) that 
<br>
information is somehow physically stored in the universe, somehow. But I 
<br>
guess that is why pharmaceutical companies make prozac ;-)
