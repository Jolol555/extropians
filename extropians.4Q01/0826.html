<p>As do my skeet-shot responses...and one possible counter-solution.
<br>
^_^
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lets assume there is a web site that lists all of the locations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of nuclear power plants in the U.S.  Lets assume that terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seek to use this information for terrorist acts.  Can a case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be made that there are benefits associated with this &quot;free&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information that exceed the risks posed by having it free?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, terrorists can find the locations of nuclear power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plants by searching the archives of local newspapers --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that will take more time.
</em><br>
<p>A drop in the bucket as far as planning their entire operation is
<br>
concerned.  Meanwhile, citizen activists who wish to protest nuclear
<br>
power plants, or counter-protestors who wish to get the facts about
<br>
just how many such plants are in operation, would be hamstrung since
<br>
they often have less resources than, say, someone willing to devote
<br>
every waking moment and all their possessions to a suicide mission.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, should students enrolling in classes involving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear physics or molecular biology be required to undergo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interviews to ascertain their motives? Or if they are foriegn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students should their names be forwarded to government agencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so they may be monitored?  (Note that this isn't foolproof
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since at least one person on the terrorist most-wanted list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a U.S. citizen.)
</em><br>
<p>It's not just non-foolproof, it would do exactly zero good - and some
<br>
harm.  There are so many foreign students, the government could not
<br>
possibly monitor even a small fraction of them.  (In fact, that *is*
<br>
the situation right now with student visas.)  Terrorists would lie
<br>
about their motives unflinchingly; only the innocent, who rightly have
<br>
reason to fear they're being set up, would be &quot;caught&quot; by this.  (The
<br>
reason: for the most part, prior innocents who were likewise caught,
<br>
once the system is in operation for a while.  At first, just the usual
<br>
nervous types, or conspiracy theorists, et cetera...but even that's
<br>
too much, IMO.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We *do* in Western societies accept the &quot;meritocracy&quot; argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a certain degree.  Only people with the proper degrees,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have passed the required exams demonstrating their competancy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are allowed to practice medicine, law, drive trucks, fly planes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  This makes sense because people who &quot;malpractice&quot; in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professions have the possibility of seriously harming other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals.  Most branches of science have not had similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirements.  Should that begin to change?
</em><br>
<p>No.  There is a difference between merely obtaining knowledge, and
<br>
putting it into practice.  For instance, I know how to fly an airplane,
<br>
to some extent: I've done plenty of simulators, and there are some
<br>
licensed pilots who know me and my skills well enough that they have
<br>
said they would, in an emergency, feel comfortable with me at the
<br>
controls of their plane if they were unable to pilot it themselves.
<br>
But I do not fly enough to be able to maintain an official pilot's
<br>
license - which certifies that my piloting skills are good enough for
<br>
day-to-day operation, and I agree they won't be without more frequent
<br>
use - therefore I am not currently allowed to fly a plane under normal
<br>
circumstances.
<br>
<p>Likewise, one can study, say, medicine in order to better understand
<br>
the body even if one has no intention of becoming a doctor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are restrictions on the professions that people who experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epileptic fits may practice (because the loss of control of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body can present a danger to others).  Presumably suicidal terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have &quot;lost control&quot; of a rational (or perhaps a &quot;social&quot;) mind -- to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what degree should one regulate (or at least track) information that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such individuals have had access to?  Data mining can easily demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;unusual&quot; information access patterns.
</em><br>
<p>Being an Extropian automatically qualifies you as &quot;unusual&quot;, these
<br>
days.  What normal person dares to dream of immortality, or
<br>
transcending the human body?  (We would like to change that, of course,
<br>
but it's the reality today.)  Merely citing &quot;unusual&quot; as good enough
<br>
evidence would put us all under investigation...and a case could be
<br>
made that the Extropy Institute is a plot to overthrow world
<br>
governments.  (Reasoning: advanced tech means that gov't as we know it
<br>
today would have to change to stay in power...or maybe just association
<br>
with libertarians would be enough, since they dare to dream of a less
<br>
empowered government, which is technically closer to the &quot;zero
<br>
government&quot; of anarchy than what we now have.)
<br>
<p>Loss of control over the physical is one thing.  Loss of control over
<br>
the mind is not so easy to put a hard line on, and all proposals I've
<br>
seen to date err on the side of snagging innocents to make sure the
<br>
guilty don't get away...except they don't get all the guilty parties.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think one should entirely restrict access to information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do think a lot more thought needs to be devoted to determining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is indeed going to be utilized responsibly.
</em><br>
<p>Off-the-cuff idea: for sensitive materials, like details of GM crop
<br>
experiments, always include pointers to the &quot;basics&quot; even in
<br>
descriptions meant only to be read by fellow experts.  This is similar
<br>
in nature to the &quot;legal boilerplate&quot; that has made law contracts so
<br>
obtuse, but keeps them (at least in theory, to a high enough degree for
<br>
the courts) from being misunderstood by complete amateurs that happen
<br>
to get ahold of them.
