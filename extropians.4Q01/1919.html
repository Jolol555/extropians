<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Once again, you are talking out your ear. Almost all were swept up

on
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; immigration violations. The rest were swept up because they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; interaction with the known hijackers or with other al Qaeda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; operatives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In a war of insurgency, as this one is, there are no front lines
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 'capture' prisoners on. This ain't no Stalag 13, no &quot;Hogan's
</em><br>
Heros&quot;,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; lady. Wake up and smell the patchouli. The enemy has infiltrated
</em><br>
our
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; homeland, they walk among us, dress like us, and try to act like
</em><br>
good
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; little westernized muslims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, someone under CIA surveillance comes up to you in an airport and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; asks the time.  The operative, because of your now known contact
</em><br>
with a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;suspected&quot; terrorist notes, &quot;Round him up for questioning!&quot; and
</em><br>
when
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you say you don't know anything it's OK to pull out all the stops to
</em><br>
get
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you to confess to your &quot;knowledge&quot;?  I'm not sure I like the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sacrificing individuals on the alter of paranoia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I've never associated with any known terrorists. If I were, I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely take it as such a slight on my personal honor to be associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with such an individual as to seek to clear up any questions about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; association.
</em><br>
<p>History seems to define who is and is not a terrorist.  Nelson Mandela,
<br>
is, or was he ever, a terrorist?  If the Al Quada network achieves
<br>
victory however defined, will the WTC events be seen as a terrorist act
<br>
or merely the opening salvo in the victory of an oppressed people?
<br>
<p>I don't know if I've had any interaction with &quot;enemies of the state&quot;
<br>
ever.  I hate to think that my views my be seen as incompatible with the
<br>
government's and that consequently my freedoms might be curtail as a
<br>
consequence.
<br>
<p>Say I was against propping up the Shaw of Iran?  Does that make me a bad
<br>
citizen?  What above the US's refusal to entertain Iran's attempts to
<br>
open up relations, what if I see that as a bad move on the US's part.
<br>
Does that make me a bad citizen?  What if I think that we should tell
<br>
the Saudis to take a hike(or at least put a plan in place to marginalize
<br>
them), does that make me a bad citizen?  What if I faxed all kinds of
<br>
material voicing my disapproval of many aspects of the PATRIOT ACT to my
<br>
Senators and congressperson (and I did), does that make me a bad
<br>
citizen?  Am I now on someone's list as being un-American?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is, of course, unless I thought the 'terrorists' were in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom fighters and that my government was a fascist tyranny. In
</em><br>
which
<br>
<em>&gt; case, I'd fully expect that government to treat me badly and take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measures in such a frame of mind. If apprehended, I'd likely make
</em><br>
claims
<br>
<em>&gt; about my civil rights being violated, being fully aware that as far as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that society was concerned, such protestations are purely for
</em><br>
propaganda
<br>
<em>&gt; purposes. Relative to that society, I would completely understand that
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; was the enemy, and proper strategy for me would be to seek to further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undermine it by trying to push that government into behaving (or being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceived as behaving) in a far more extremist manner than it actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is or is preceived to be. More extremism on my enemy's part will
</em><br>
recruit
<br>
<em>&gt; more people to my cause, and their strategies should also be to
</em><br>
increase
<br>
<em>&gt; the extremism of our opponents until enough of the population is
</em><br>
pissed
<br>
<em>&gt; off by that government that it rises up and overthrows it.
</em><br>
<p>In other words, history is written by the victors and they define
<br>
&quot;terrorists&quot; as the losers.  If the truth be told, terrorists .... er, I
<br>
mean patriots, founded America.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you see how people like Samantha, et al, by harping on how 'bad'
</em><br>
our
<br>
<em>&gt; government and society are, contribute to the cause of the enemy, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this light?
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the US government as beyond reproach and I don't see those
<br>
who disagree with any of its acts as enemies of the state.  I like to
<br>
think of myself as a part owner of the government, not one of the
<br>
&quot;owned.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am sure Samantha says what she does entirely from the best of
</em><br>
motives.
<br>
<em>&gt; I just don't think she thinks this through entirely.
</em><br>
<p>That's a double edged sword.
