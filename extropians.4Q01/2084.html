Scerir forwards:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of intelligence, they say, cannot ignore a living being's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment, including its very own body. In their view, an organism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is only intelligent relative to how well it solves the problems that its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surroundings throw at it. This runs counter to many historical ideas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the concept that the mind is separate from the body, or that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is possible to build a desktop computer that thinks like a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without having the same physical environment or body.
</em><br>
<p>Why was the subject of this posting &quot;Scientists locate intelligence
<br>
... in brain&quot;, when the claim of the article is that intelligence is
<br>
as much a property of the BODY and that the idea of associating it with
<br>
just the brain is supposedly obsolete?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To explore the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of intelligence, the researchers ran computer simulations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial neural networks called &quot;minibrains.&quot; In the simulations, 251
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minibrains each attempted to pick the less popular of two choices, 0
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 1, analogous to 251 motorists all trying to pick the less congested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; road.  This &quot;Minority Game&quot; would be repeated over many successive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rounds. Each minibrain consisted of three layers of &quot;neurons&quot;: &quot;input
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurons,&quot; which dictated how many past rounds it could remember,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leading to an intermediary layer, which then led into an &quot;output&quot; layer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that determined what choice was made.
</em><br>
<p>This is the oldest model of neural networks around.  These simple 3
<br>
layer networks with Hebbian learning models were considered obsolete 30
<br>
years ago.  I'm amazed that people are still using them and trying to
<br>
draw results from them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researchers introduced a &quot;rogue&quot; minibrain with more intermediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurons to analyze the past rounds did it attain more than a 50 percent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success rate.  Their simulations suggest that intelligence often hinges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on how much one can make use of the data in its physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. (Wakeling and Bak, Physical Review E, November
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2001) 
</em><br>
<p>Gee, let's see, they made a network with more layer-two neurons and it did
<br>
better than the ones with fewer.  Making a bigger BRAIN made it do better.
<br>
Does that surprise anyone?  Seem like an earthshaking result?
<br>
<p>How exactly does that support their notion that the mind can no longer
<br>
be considered separate from the body?  They made the BRAIN bigger and
<br>
it got more intelligent, unsurprisingly.  Seems rather a weak foundation
<br>
to draw sweeping philosophical conclusions about the mind-body problem.
