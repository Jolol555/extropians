<p>
&quot;&gt; If patents or copyrights didn't exist then there would be
<br>
little
<br>
<em>&gt; incentive for investors to provide the funds for everything from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biotech startups to movies like The Matrix.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Some distinctions need to be made for various types of patents
<br>
and copyrights.  Patents on software, for instance, have a quite
<br>
different set of evil effects than patents of physical
<br>
inventions generally.  Copyrights on music are a great deal
<br>
different than copyrights on some other materials.  As the
<br>
digitial age unfolds what used to make obvious sense to
<br>
copyright and was enforceable trivially and with reasonable (or
<br>
at least workable and public) restraints for the sake of the
<br>
public now make a lot less sense and/or the restraints can
<br>
be/are removed thus decreasing the benefits to the public and
<br>
society at large.  
<br>
<p>Distinctions also need to be made between what patents and
<br>
copyrights are and are not for and the implementations of
<br>
patents and copyrights in particular areas.
<br>
<p>Assumptions should not be made without considerable evidence
<br>
and/or reasoning about whether this or that would exist without
<br>
the current shape and extent of patent and copyright law.  We
<br>
could also get into negative impacts of current patents and
<br>
copyrights on invention, innovation and real wealth and
<br>
distribution of wealth more broadly (by creating more wealth
<br>
rather than redistributing the existing pie).  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now note that this is a bit different from the MP3 question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the perspective that the infrastructure required for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biotech startups and movies generally starts at $1-5M.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That differs from &quot;bands&quot; where the infrastructure required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be less than $10K.  Generally speaking bands don't &quot;need&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors (though one might view the record labels who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create bands by design as such) while biotech and movies do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Very true.  On the other hand, it is damn hard to make a living
<br>
as a musician.  I have too many friends who worked at that for
<br>
too many years and mostly failed under the old model.  If music
<br>
diversity is a benefit we care about then new models of some
<br>
kind seem to be required.  A model that doesn't pay anyone in an
<br>
economy where being paid is the only way to survive, much less
<br>
strive, is clearly not a more helpful model.  But we need to get
<br>
more creative rather than more draconian in shoring up
<br>
out-of-date systems that don't work.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So if you want rapid technology progress you *need* to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system where investors believe that they will have a &quot;protected&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ROI that balances the risk of early stage investments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not entirely sure that our current VC and invested funded
<br>
start-up environment is the only or best way to do things from
<br>
here on to the Singularity.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Note that as costs decline for such things as HDTV cameras,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer based film editing equipment and VR design tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become increasingly realistic and run on faster computers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the film industry becomes more like the music industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in its need for &quot;protection&quot;).  The same may be true in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biotechnology industry over the next decade as technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop.  I suspect however there will always be some industries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will require protection for investors to take risks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that facilitate their development.  Thus, IMO, the solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not to do away with patents and copyrights but to reform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to match specific industries (e.g. drug patents that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last 10 years instead of 20).
</em><br>
<p>The music publishers need &quot;protectection&quot; largely because they
<br>
are occupying a niche that is increasingly irrelevant. 
<br>
Protecting niches that should be phased out is not healthy.  It
<br>
saps the strength of the approaching Singularity.  It limits the
<br>
options and depth and breadth of knowledge available to us all. 
<br>
<p>I agree with some of your points at this particular stage in our
<br>
development.  But I think we should be more wary of fixed time
<br>
periods.  We need hedge clauses that allow us to adapt to
<br>
quickly changing circumstances.
