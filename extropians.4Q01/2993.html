In Pakistan, It's Jihad 101

By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN
<br>
ESHAWAR, Pakistan
<br>
<p>You need only spend an afternoon walking through the Storytellers' Bazaar here
<br>
in Peshawar, a few miles from the Afghan border, to understand that America
<br>
needs to do its business in Afghanistan — eliminate Osama bin Laden and his
<br>
Taliban pro tectors — as quickly as possible and get out of here. This is not
<br>
a neighborhood where we should linger. This is not Mr. Rogers's neighborhood.
<br>
<p>What makes me say that? I don't know, maybe it was the street vendor who asked
<br>
me exactly what color Osama bin Laden T-shirt I wanted — the yellow one with
<br>
his picture on it or the white one simply extolling him as the hero of the
<br>
Muslim nation and vowing &quot;Jihad Is Our Mission.&quot; (He was doing a brisk
<br>
business among the locals.) Or maybe it was the wall poster announcing: Call
<br>
this phone number if you want to join the &quot;Jihad against America.&quot; Or maybe it
<br>
was all the Urdu wall graffiti reading &quot;Honor Is in Jihad&quot; and &quot;The Alliance
<br>
Between the Hunood [Indians] and Yahood [Jews] Is Unacceptable.&quot; Or maybe it
<br>
was the cold stares and steely eyes that greeted the obvious foreigner. Those
<br>
eyes did not say &quot;American Express accepted here.&quot; They said &quot;Get lost.&quot;
<br>
<p>Welcome to Peshawar. Oh, and did I mention? This is Pakistan — these guys are
<br>
on our side. Fat chance. This whole region of northwest Pakistan is really
<br>
just an extension of Afghanistan, dominated by the same ethnic Pashtuns that
<br>
make up the Taliban. This is bin Laden land. This is not a region where
<br>
America is going to sink any friendly roots. In part it's because the Pashtuns
<br>
here all, understandably, side with their brothers in Afghanistan; in part
<br>
it's because they were jilted once before by the Americans — after the U.S.
<br>
just dropped Pakistan like a used hanky once the Soviets left Afghanistan. But
<br>
most important, it's because of the education system here.
<br>
<p>On the way into Peshawar I stopped to visit the Darul Uloom Haqqania, the
<br>
biggest madrasa, or Islamic school, in Pakistan, with 2,800 live-in students —
<br>
all studying the Koran and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad with the hope of
<br>
becoming mullahs, or spiritual leaders. I was allowed to sit in on a class
<br>
with young boys, who sat on the floor, practicing their rote learning of the
<br>
Koran from holy texts perched on wooden holders. This was the core of their
<br>
studies. Most will never be exposed to critical thinking or modern subjects.
<br>
<p>It was at once impressive and disquieting. It was impressive because the
<br>
madrasas provide room, board, education and clothing for thousands of
<br>
Pakistani boys — who would otherwise be left out on the streets because of the
<br>
gradual collapse of Pakistan's secular, state education system. In 1978 there
<br>
were 3,000 madrasas in Pakistan; today there are 39,000. It was disquieting
<br>
because their almost entirely religious curriculum was designed by the Mogul
<br>
emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir, who died in 1707. There was one shelf of science
<br>
books in the library — largely from the 1920's.
<br>
<p>The air in the Koran class was so thick and stale you could have cut it into
<br>
blocks and sold it like ice. A sign on the wall said this room was &quot;A gift of
<br>
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&quot; The teacher asked an 8-year-old boy to chant a
<br>
Koranic verse for us, which he did with the beauty and elegance of an
<br>
experienced muezzin. What did it mean? It was a famous verse: &quot;The faithful
<br>
shall enter paradise and the unbelievers shall be condemned to eternal
<br>
hellfire.&quot;
<br>
<p>I asked one of the students, an Afghan refugee, Rahim Kunduz, age 12, what his
<br>
reaction was to the Sept. 11 attacks, and he said: &quot;Most likely the attack
<br>
came from Americans inside America. I am pleased that America has had to face
<br>
pain, because the rest of the world has tasted its pain.&quot; And his view of
<br>
Americans generally? &quot;They are unbelievers and do not like to befriend Muslims
<br>
and they want to dominate the world with their power.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Darul Uloom Haqqania madrasa is famous because the Taliban leader, Mullah
<br>
Muhammad Omar, once attended it, as did many other top Taliban figures. Mullah
<br>
Omar never graduated, our guide explained, &quot;but we gave him an honorary degree
<br>
anyway, because he left to do jihad and to create a pristine Islamic
<br>
government.&quot;
<br>
<p>As we were leaving, my Pakistani friend asked the school's rector a question
<br>
he had posed to me, which I couldn't answer: How come Americans are so good at
<br>
selling Coke and McDonald's to people all over the world, but can't sell their
<br>
policies?
<br>
<p>&quot;Because their policies are poisonous and their Coke is sweet,&quot; said Moulana
<br>
Samiul Haq.
<br>
<p>I am all for reviewing our policies, but only the Pakistanis can rebuild their
<br>
schools so they meld modernity, Islam and pluralism. Bin Laden is a sideshow,
<br>
but one we must deal with. The real war for peace in this region, though, is
<br>
in the schools. Which is why we must do our military operation against bin
<br>
Laden quickly and then get out of here. When we return, and we must, we have
<br>
to be armed with modern books and schools — not tanks. Only then might we
<br>
develop a new soil — a new generation as hospitable to our policies as to our
<br>
burgers.
<br>
<p>Until then, nothing pro-American will grow here.

<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
