<em>&gt; Okay, I'll buy your distinction.
</em><br>
<p>It's not mine; it's a paraphrase of official US Military doctrine, gleaned
<br>
from things like the SEAL Team Leader handbook. I do diverse recreational reading.
<br>
<p>Fact of the matter is, if the action isn't _extremely_ &quot;surgical&quot;, or
<br>
extremely isolated (Manhattan/SILVERPLATE), or both, even the &quot;covert&quot; label is 
<br>
wishful thinking. Mystiques and glamours and ego and spin and post-action disinformation
<br>
to placate bosses and homefront hoi polloi are evolutionarily stable strategies.
<br>
<p>John le Carre and others have scratched the seamy surface fictionally for years.
<br>
<p>There is a vast amount of wiggle room, ineptness, expediency and groupthink
<br>
_everywhere_, not excluding the spook world.
<br>
<p>Everybody _wants_ to be doing stuff so slick it never gets out. Doesn't mean
<br>
they're actually doing it. Everybody's an idiot sometimes (weak form of Dilbert Law).
<br>
<p>Another factor is that no &quot;professional&quot; wants to &quot;live in a toilet&quot; (not my term; I hear
<br>
this is common parlance in the diplomatic _and_ spook community for much of the third 
<br>
world), this metaphor keeps such folks attention-avers, so they (have to) delegate to 
<br>
locals and we get leaks and messes--&quot;if you want it done right, do it yourself&quot; hinges 
<br>
crucially on what &quot;it&quot; is, and how _much_ you *really* want it. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Professional&quot; is frequently a euphemism for &quot;Careerist&quot;.
<br>
<p>Thought experiment: Spend a day and watch both versions of _Apocalypse Now_ 
<br>
in chronological order. :) Whatever you can say of Kurz--he wanted it _bad_.
<br>
Then there's the legend of Keyser Soeze in _The Usual Suspects_. Tough hombres 
<br>
with long attention spans. Not nice people. 
<br>
<p>Anyway, I consider it utterly conceivable that some operatives, somewhere, some time, 
<br>
might have pickled or spiked sombody's nuke, and that the owner of said nuke remained 
<br>
blissfully unaware that their suitcase or oil drum had been neutered.
<br>
<p>That's my kind of clandestine. :) But it might be just my bourgeois fantasy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  However, most of what are put into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first bin -- covert operations -- are actually only covert from US public.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the CIA is funding or training a local group to overthrow some government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wherever, usually the people in that country know the US government is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, see my comments above; and also, if the CIA/whoever has ever done 
<br>
anything in living memory, anyone who looks or acts out of place is looked on 
<br>
with suspicion. This is prudent immune system behavior, but it's hard on 
<br>
tourists, service volunteers and the naive.
<br>
<p>A firm hand on the bullshit valve is an essential part of domestic and foreign affairs.
<br>
There is also the &quot;burden of nescience&quot; and the &quot;burden of omniscience&quot; to consider
<br>
(terms from R. A. Wilson, I think).
<br>
<p>Zeteticism with equanimity is hard, we're not wired deeply for it.

diplomacy, integrity, courage, kindness, skepticism.
