<em>&gt; &quot;no aid&quot; policy no one can never accuse you of meddling or

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Techno - a very easy statement for you to make - you have access to

power, a
<br>
<em>&gt; computer, the internet, clean water and hospitals. Most of the world
</em><br>
does
<br>
<em>&gt; not.
</em><br>
<p>So, your idea here is that only people who have the loot can be
<br>
libertarians?  And also that others can only get the loot by having it
<br>
given to them through foreign aid packages?  I.e., trade and voluntary
<br>
charity can't do this?
<br>
<p>Also, you don't know my condition aside from the fact that I have access
<br>
to the internet.  Don't make assumptions here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We as a species really do need to learn not to live in luxury at the
</em><br>

</em><br>
will we
<br>
<em>&gt; cope when new technologies make the majority of jobs redundant?
</em><br>
<p>Your assumption here is that if some live better than others, it must be
<br>
because the others are living worse off.  In other words, people only
<br>
make wealth by taking wealth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tiny percentage of the population can find ANY meaningful paid
</em><br>
employment,
<br>
<em>&gt; who will feed you, your friends and family?
</em><br>
<p>A few years ago, I saw a retrospective on the 1960s.  In it, some guy
<br>
whined about how automation was taking jobs away.  I got the idea the
<br>
guy didn't do a study of the problem, but was just mouthing slogans in
<br>
the air at the time.  Why would I think this?  Well, partly from his
<br>
demeanor I admit and the fact that the person interviewing him didn't
<br>
bother to challenge him on this, but also partly because there are more
<br>
jobs now in total in the US, then there were in the 1960s.
<br>
<p>I think the thing holding the Third World back is not the lack of First
<br>
World foreign aid, but the lack of respect for property rights (see
<br>
Hernando De Soto's -- the Peruvian economist NOT the Spanish
<br>
explorer:) -- _The Other Path_ and _The Mystery of Capital: Why
<br>
Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else_) and, all too
<br>
often, because First World foreign comes in an destroys the society.
<br>
Since the former should be obvious, let me elaborate on the latter.
<br>
Foreign aid not only helps to keep unpopular regimes in power, it allows
<br>
them to pursue wreckless policies, including Israel's continued high
<br>
level of public sector economic activity and Egypt's devotion to
<br>
building up its military despite it having no real threats to its
<br>
security -- unless Israle is the threat.
<br>
<p>Also, foreign aid often destroys local economies, as happened in Somalia
<br>
in the early 1990s.  US grain shipments to Somalia actually helped to
<br>
bankrupt a lot of small farmers.  Why?  People in cities could get grain
<br>
for free, so the small farmers then lost their revenues and, guess
<br>
what?, they became refugees and moved to the cities!  See _The Road to
<br>
Hell: The Ravaging Effects of Foreign Aid and International Charity_
<br>
by Michael Maren and _The Tears of the White Man: Compassion As
<br>
Contempt_ by Pascal Bruckner.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should you then live in shit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disease &amp; starvation? I somehow suspect you will have a very different
</em><br>
idea
<br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;welfare&quot; &amp; &quot;foreign aid&quot; then.
</em><br>
<p>This is sort of like saying, if a robot beats you up, you'll finally
<br>
understand technophobia.
<br>
<p>The problem is being in the situation does not help you to get out of it
<br>
or to necessarily understand it.  Every so often in Hollywood, they
<br>
through parties where some people get a premium dinner and others get a
<br>
bowl of rice.  The goal?  To help rich actors understand what it feels
<br>
like to live in the Third World.  Well, this doesn't help people in the
<br>
Third World.  If you really want to help them, then remove the barriers
<br>
to them helping themselves and, if you feel so inclined, give charity
<br>
from your funds -- not other people's.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
