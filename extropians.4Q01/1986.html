<p>
Transhumanists and Extropians,
<br>
<p>Like Aristotle and Joseph Fletcher, I accept only a &quot;cognitive criterion
<br>
of humanhood&quot; (the name of a Fletcher essay).  In Aristotle's Biology, 
<br>
he observes that the _only_ thing that separates humans from others in 
<br>
the animal kingdom is the ability of reason.  Aristotle coined the word
<br>
biology and the word physics and is considered the &quot;Father of Science&quot;
<br>
by professors in the humanities.  (I have a B.S. in Biology and 
<br>
Philosophy - that's where this perspective comes from.)
<br>
<p>As noted in my bioethics class, US society seems to have an intuitive 
<br>
acceptance of this.  Those that are too young, senile or mentally 
<br>
handicapped (e.g. Down's Syndrome, trisomy 21), are granted fewer
<br>
rights than others.  Likewise, those demonstrated by a US court of law 
<br>
to be criminals (and therefore irrational), have their life's freedom 
<br>
greatly restricted or eliminated entirely.
<br>
<p>Similarly, it seems that transhumans are defined by cognitive criteria
<br>
though posthumans are physically defined by genetic or cybernetic 
<br>
enhancements in the future.
<br>
<p>Those that behave in a criminal and irrational, uncivilized manner can
<br>
not be defined as human, transhuman and certainly not posthuman.  At 
<br>
best, they can be called &quot;prehuman&quot;.  
<br>
<p>What constitutes &quot;human rights&quot;?  Since genetically our taxonomic,
<br>
cladistic, genetic similarities are   so striking to other species
<br>
such as chimpanzees and esp. the Bonobo chimps, I think that human
<br>
rights must be defined cognitively by rational behavior.  The issue of
<br>
&quot;animal rights&quot; only reaches a threshold in rare cases such as that of
<br>
chimpanzees and dolphins possibly whales that show signs of intelligence,
<br>
organized behavior and maybe even a sense of ethics.  No other  animals
<br>
have any right to exist except at our human, transhuman or posthuman
<br>
pleasure.  This is also found in the concept of sentience as found in 
<br>
many thoughtful science fiction and in notions such as the Prime 
<br>
Directive of Star Trek.
<br>
<p>This background explains why terrorists need not be actively dehumanized
<br>
because they have done that themselves.  It is also why their 
<br>
extermination is no worse than killing a rabid dog in the streets of any
<br>
city.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
William Web.
