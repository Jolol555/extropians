</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Excuse me, but when our moral intuitions say that two things are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different, they usually are.  If you shove a person in front of a trolley,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and he dies, and then it turns out that it was a false threat... well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oops.  If the switch is a false threat then flipping it does no damage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Uncertainty about the outcome of actions is one of the foundations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethics, one of the environmental conditions to which moral intuitions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an adaptation, and quite relevant here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, you don't understand the scenario. In both situations, you have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice of five people definitely dying versus one person definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dying. No 'uncertainty'.
</em><br>
<p>Of course there's uncertainty.  If you're dealing with 100% probabilities
<br>
then you have left the universe humanity grew up in, and your moral
<br>
intuitions are going to be totally out of sync.  Telling people to believe
<br>
in a hypothetical scenario like that proves nothing except that the
<br>
philosophers or cognitive scientists fail to understand the problem they
<br>
are exploring.  We are hardwired not to be that certain.  It would take an
<br>
act of deliberate mental self-control to switch off the perception of
<br>
uncertainty - it can't just be done on a philosopher's instruction.  It
<br>
would take an evolutionary psychologist to furthermore work out which of
<br>
the moral intuitions are related to the presence of uncertainty and apply
<br>
a compensating counterbias so as to work out an abstract response which
<br>
would be suited to this alternate universe in which it is possible to be
<br>
certain of things.
<br>
<p>Let's suppose that you have the choice of either six people dying, or six
<br>
people or six people dying.  Let us furthermore suppose that the laws of
<br>
arithmetic are altered so that all numbers are equal to six, but not all
<br>
sixes are equal to each other.  Do you throw the switch?
<br>
