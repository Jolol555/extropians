<em>&gt;  (...) I feel no nationalist rage here, only an

<em>&gt; awareness that many Middle Easterners values are what is behind their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misery, poverty, inequalities, and injustices; (...)
</em><br>
<p><p>I was watching a documentary about Mauritania some time ago. It showed
<br>
&quot;desert libraries&quot;, little lost villages in the middle of the desert,
<br>
in which people preserve old books (ie try to avoid that they turn to
<br>
dust), take this occupation very seriously and seem to be content with
<br>
it. Some of them have lost the knowledge required to actually read the
<br>
books.
<br>
<p>Though the people looked cordial and nice, I was struck by the
<br>
passivity implied. Of course there are librarians in Occident, too,
<br>
but they seem to be more useful, as none seemed to actually use the
<br>
&quot;desert libraries&quot;...
<br>
<p>It occured to me that humanity is supposed to have been born in
<br>
Africa, and that some people stayed there, while other moved. I seem
<br>
to recall that it was in 35 000 BC that massive emigration to Europe
<br>
took place. A few centuries ago, Europeans emigrated to the US. Within
<br>
a few decades, some people may start to colonize space.
<br>
<p>Each time such an emigration happens, isn't it likely that there be an
<br>
important genetic and cultural self-selection ? Those who stay tend to
<br>
be more traditional and conservative, content with what they have, and
<br>
not willing to take risks. Those who go tend to be more adventurous,
<br>
more confident in themselves, more eager to discover new things
<br>
(neophile as Max More would say).
<br>
<p>Is it not imaginable that, by successive such migrations, an evolution
<br>
by self-selection happens (both genetic and cultural), such that you
<br>
can basically calculate the &quot;adventurous index&quot; based on the distance
<br>
from central Africa ?
<br>
<p>Couldn't some kind of over-traditionnalism brought by this evolution
<br>
account for some of Africa and ME difficulties ? Couldn't there be
<br>
some kind of automatic hatred for the successful and not traditional,
<br>
some negative thinking, and avoidance of responsability (think of the
<br>
&quot;altruism claim&quot;) explainable by such genetic-cultural differentiation
<br>
through absence of migration ?
<br>
<p>Can't you actually correlate riches to the &quot;adventurous&quot; index : the
<br>
farther you go from central Africa, the more riches you find ?
<br>
<p>Obviously Extropianism would appear as a new sort of migration
<br>
(actually translating into geographical migration if you consider
<br>
space) bringing a new such self-selection (whatever the further
<br>
changes Extropians actually perform on themselves).
