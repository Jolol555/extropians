<em>&gt; `Bizarre chemical discovery gives homeopathic hint.'
</em><br>
<p>New scientists usually does better than this; they did a reasonable
<br>
job of covering the effect itself--and I'm not surprized that some
<br>
homepaths will latch onto this as justification--but their coverage
<br>
of that angle really dropped the ball.  Quacks frequently latch onto
<br>
some vaguely-related real scientific result and make it sound like
<br>
it applies to what they do when it doesn't apply at all.
<br>
<p>Even the first sentence with the &quot;H&quot; word here is hopelessly flawed,
<br>
mentioning something like &quot;...may help explain how homeopathic
<br>
remedies work...&quot; is a classic rhetorical technique that implies to
<br>
the reader that such remedies do actually work, when they don't,
<br>
and that we just don't know the mechanism.  Homeopathy isn't just
<br>
an &quot;unexplained&quot; effect--it's a theory that's been well tested
<br>
for decades and failed every test (except one or two you might
<br>
expect it to pass just by chance).
<br>
<p>He then goes on to confuse high-dilution homeopathy (which is the
<br>
vast majority of homeopathic remedies, the only ones sold over
<br>
the counter, and to which this result doesn't apply, with the
<br>
low-dilution stuff which isn't really homeopathy at all, but
<br>
which modern homeopaths have started selling (under prescription,
<br>
because they actually contain things) to boost their image.  Even
<br>
here, while this new result might have something to do with low-
<br>
dilution remedies, no real attempt is made to connect them, and the
<br>
reader is still left with the unstated assumption that these things
<br>
actually work and we just don't know how.
