<p>This seems like an odd way to view things.  If you get twice as many
<br>
Australian dollars, but the Australian dollars are only worth half as 
<br>
much as US Dollars (which must mean that you can only buy half 
<br>
as much with an Australian dollar as with a US Dollar, all else being
<br>
equal), then you're making the same as you would in the US, right?
<br>
<p>If people in general are poorer there, then you might be able to live
<br>
better than you would in the US, but otherwise, it would seem to be
<br>
exactly the same.  What am I missing?
