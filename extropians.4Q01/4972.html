</em><br>
<p>Wow!  You're saying that the ACLU is actually *opposed* to civil rights?
<br>
And that the reason they defend Nazis and such is to discredit the very
<br>
cause that they claim to be working for?
<br>
<p>That's amazing.  Who all is in on this conspiracy?  What about all the
<br>
people who donate to the ACLU?  Don't they know that the organization
<br>
is working to prevent civil rights rather than to support them?
