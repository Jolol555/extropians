<em>&gt; As a joke, while the two beings with identical memories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. are sleeping the doctors decide to put you both in a human shuffling
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now both beings wake up. Which one is you?
</em><br>
<p>The question is imprecise.  &quot;You&quot; is a pronoun that could refer to anybody.
<br>
Every reader of this message on this list is thinking about a different
<br>
person when they read that pronoun.  Which of them is the real &quot;you&quot; that
<br>
was specified?  There is no real answer because the question is imprecise.
<br>
Every reader will have a different frame of reference.
<br>
<p>Here are some more precise questions:
<br>
<p>Which has my stunningly good looks?  Both.
<br>
Which has my bizarre sense of humor?  Both.
<br>
Which has my genetic code?  Both.
<br>
Which has my memories of this discussion?  Both.
<br>
Which grew up in Florida?  The first one.
<br>
Which is a glorified evolved uber-monkey?  The first one.
<br>
Which is a scientific marvel of modern technology?  The second one.
<br>
Which was appointed to the ExI Board of Directors?  The first one.
<br>
Which might try to get me thrown off the Board?  The second one.
<br>
Which one is not doubted to be me by anybody?  The first one.
<br>
Which one needs to be measured and compared to the other to determine if it
<br>
is &quot;correct&quot;?  The second one.
<br>
Which one doesn't have to worry about developing copy-related flaws later?
<br>
The first one.
<br>
Which one might develop copy-related flaws later?  The second one.
<br>
<p>Here are some non-objective questions with no objective answer:
<br>
<p>Which one is &quot;me&quot;?
<br>
Which one is more &quot;me&quot; than the other?
<br>
What &quot;rights&quot; does each one have?
<br>
What &quot;property&quot; does each on retain?
<br>
Which one should go to the next Board meeting?
<br>
Which one uses my toothbrush and which one buys another one?
<br>
Which one gets to hold the TV remote?
<br>
Which one will my spouse choose to sleep with?
<br>
Which one will live out the future I &quot;should&quot; have lived?
<br>
<p>I see no difficulty with the copying process itself.  All of the
<br>
difficulties seem to derive from new questions about what should we call
<br>
them, how should we treat them the same, how should we treat them
<br>
differently.  These are decision choices of a personal nature, and not
<br>
objective scientific facts which can be measured and answered precisely.
