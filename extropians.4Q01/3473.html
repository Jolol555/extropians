<em>&gt; &gt; Attacking a _profession_ is fair game, because people choose their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; professions, and are therefore rightly judged by those choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A medical ethicist is someone who has willfully chosen as a profession
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to increase death and suffering in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be fair game to attack professions, but I find it rather hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that medical ethicists see as their aim to increase death and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering. Yes, you may think they as a profession increase them in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world (which is also debatable), but making claims about their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual motivations is rather extreme. Any evidence?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying that their direct motives are to increase suffering; I'm
<br>
saying that the _rationally expectable consequences_ of many of their
<br>
actions, do, in fact, increase suffering.  People should not be judged
<br>
by their motives: they should be judged by what a rational person could
<br>
predict would be the likely consequences of their actions.  I'm sure
<br>
some of them occasionally fall upon doing the right thing, like making
<br>
sure a patient is fully informed and gives consent.  But what I see
<br>
most of them doing is putting blocks in the way of people acting with
<br>
the unanimous consent of all involved; and a rational person can see
<br>
that that can have no positive benefit to anyone.
