<p>
Allow me to intrude on your debate with Kai.
<br>
<p>As a relatively recent European import, I retained some of the amazement
<br>
that most Europeans feel at the idea that widespread gun ownership is
<br>
desirable. Yet, some of the American way rubbed off on me, since I no longer
<br>
have a strong negative emotional reaction to gun ownership.
<br>
<p>As Robert Bradbury wrote, what really counts, is the statistically
<br>
measurable influence of guns on the survival of citizens. All &quot;should's&quot; and
<br>
&quot;shouldn't's&quot; must be predicated on objective data. It appears to me that
<br>
neither side of the debate (and mean in the American society at large, not
<br>
here on the list) can make a clear argument in their favor, perhaps because
<br>
such data is entwined in some very complex sets of confounding factors.
<br>
<p>Additionally, the results of allowing gun ownership might be widely
<br>
different under various conditions. In a brigand-infested wilderness, guns
<br>
in the hands of good citizens are a necessity - Kai's cops will not show up
<br>
there. In a building under total surveillance and a rapid-response security
<br>
team (like the Capitol), guns do not offer an edge in defence but do pose
<br>
the risk if carried by random psychos. Guns on airliners are totally silly -
<br>
in case of a scuffle, you would get most of the damage from rounds fired by
<br>
well-meaning WWII vets with hand tremor.
<br>
<p>So, I do not believe that a satisfactory, objective and generalized answer
<br>
can be found. In a society where the majority wants guns, and machinists are
<br>
willing and able to make them from old cars, you might as well have to
<br>
accept them. In a society with a swiftly-responding police and a majority of
<br>
the population against guns (and willing to snitch on illegal owners and
<br>
suppliers), it might be more life-saving to ruthlessly persecute illegal gun
<br>
owners. Jedem das Seine.
<br>
<p>One more remark: Guns do not kill people. Bullets do (except if you use the
<br>
gun to clobber the other guy on the head).
<br>
<p>Why not allow gun ownership, but tightly control the manufacture and sale of
<br>
ammunition? 
<br>
<p>You could design non-lethal tamper-proof rounds, capable of knocking out any
<br>
attacker. Anybody insisting on owning and using deadly ammo could be in
<br>
clear conscience treated as a person intending to murder innocent people
<br>
(and preventatively removed from the society). Maniacs would need to first
<br>
shoot you, then come over and slit your throat - this would severely cramp
<br>
their style. Good citizens threatened by bad guys would be just as safe as
<br>
if owning a regular Magnum 367 (or whatever).
<br>
<p>You could even shoot first, and ask questions later.
<br>
<p>Wouldn't that be better?
<br>
