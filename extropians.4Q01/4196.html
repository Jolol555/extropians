Now, if someone said that &quot;Primo 3M+&quot; is a hoax and a fake image, I'd 
<br>
wonder why he lacked a sense of inventiveness and conception -:)  We 
<br>
artists summon up a blank slate in our brains and fillit with all sorts of 
<br>
conceptions. This artist has a vivid imagination and a sense of marketing 
<br>
and commercial design.  I like his work very much.  In fact, I think 
<br>
&quot;Malepregnancy&quot; is a fantastic example of conceptual art realized in 
<br>
net.art genre.  Very extropic.I haven't had time to read each page, I more 
<br>
or less skimmed the layout and imagery.I don't think he is a Performance 
<br>
Artist, but a Filmmaker and net.artist.

=================================================
<br>
<p>Oh, with connections, there remains the possibility that he could 
<br>
transition his canvas from the electronic to the flesh, and become the 
<br>
ultimate Performance Artist...is it not so?

As far as I know, there is yet to be discovered a substitute for the womb. 
<br>
A fetus needs this environment to develop and grow for many months before 
<br>
surviving outside it. (Anybody out there know the record for viability?) 
<br>
&quot;preemies&quot; also frequently face enormous physical and mental challenges. So 
<br>
women's BODIES are still absolutely necessary for reproducing life.
<br>
<p>Well, technically this isn't true.
<br>
Extrauterine pregnancies (also called abdominal pregnancies) are possible, 
<br>
and an amazing 5% of them are viable. It's very rare, but babies can be 
<br>
grown abdominally and then born live by surgical delivery. This sometimes 
<br>
happens when the fertilized egg heads the wrong way down the Fallopian tube 
<br>
and comes out in the abdomen instead of in the uterus.
<br>
All that is necessary is for a fertilized egg to implant in a place where 
<br>
it can tap into a blood supply. The uterus is ideally suited to this 
<br>
function, but other internal organs can be attached to; the fertilized egg 
<br>
produces enzymes which eat into whatever it lands on so that it can attach 
<br>
and tap into the blood vessels.
<br>
There are two catches:
<br>
The fetus is essentially a parasite; whereas the uterus is designed to 
<br>
support the parasite, other internal organs are not, and serious damage can 
<br>
be done to the host.
<br>
If the fetus implants in a place where it can thrive without killing the 
<br>
host, it can grow to a point where it is viable and can be delivered 
<br>
surgically. However, this leaves the big problem of what to do about the 
<br>
implantation site. Again, the uterus is ideally suited to coping with the 
<br>
eight-inch wound left when the placenta separates; other organs have no 
<br>
mechanism for helping the placenta to separate and then contracting around 
<br>
themselves to stop the bleeding.
<br>
Current medical practice is to cut the umbilical cord close to the placenta 
<br>
and leave it inside. If all goes well, it will eventually shrink and be 
<br>
reabsorbed. There is a serious risk of infection and other complications.
<br>
So, although it's possible to grow a baby without a uterus, it's very 
<br>
unlikely and very dangerous

Male pregnancy has once again hit the news. This is one of those perennial 
<br>
subjects which journalists like me love to drag out and give a good 
<br>
shaking. Normally there are one or two men who pop up and say theyre up 
<br>
for it in a rather earnest rose tinted way. There are shock horror gasps 
<br>
all round, and then we put it back in the cupboard again ready for the next 
<br>
time. Nobody ever seems to tell you how it is, so if youre a boy thinking 
<br>
male pregnancy sounds rather sweet, listen up. Leaving aside the 
<br>
consequences of having to take all those hormones (lost body hair, 
<br>
burgeoning bosom etc), abdominal pregnancy remains the most dangerous form 
<br>
of ectopic pregnancy. It occurs (rarely) in women and maternal death from 
<br>
extreme blood loss is frequent. In addition about three quarters of the 1 
<br>
in 20 babies that survive, have serious compression abnormalities - defects 
<br>
caused by being squashed. Seahorses are about the only creature I know 
<br>
about that manages male pregnancy. Best leave it to them boys.
<br>
=================================================
<br>
Many a woman will wear a smile the day this urban legend morphs into reality.
