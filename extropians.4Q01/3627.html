A physicist, a mathematician and an engineer are travelling
<br>
by rail.  As they cross into Scotland, they observe a single
<br>
black sheep grazing on a distant hill.  The engineer comments:
<br>
&quot;Remarkable!  The sheep in Scotland are black!&quot;  The
<br>
physicist corrects, &quot;Scotland has at least one black sheep.&quot;
<br>
The mathematician carefully observes: &quot;From the evidence
<br>
we have before us, we can only conclude that Scotland has
<br>
at least one sheep, at least one side of which is black.&quot;
<br>
<p>George Woltman, the guiding spirit of GIMPS, has announced
<br>
on the list that he has verified the 39th Mersenne prime on his
<br>
P4.  Being the careful mathematician, he is getting a second
<br>
confirmation using a different software and different hardware.
<br>
When the second confirmation is complete on December 6,
<br>
he will announce the find to the press.  Many of us feel his
<br>
caution is as overstated as the sheep-observing mathematician,
<br>
but George is the boss.  Look for the announcement in about
<br>
a week.  spike
