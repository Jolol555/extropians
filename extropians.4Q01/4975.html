<em>&gt; &gt; New Freedom, where free yeomen till their initially equal parcels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of land and pay only minimal taxes to support a freely elected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constabulary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taxes are coercive.  Elections are coercive.  You model already has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercion built into it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### OK - you made my day. Let's say the colonists just arrive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haphazardly from other planets, in small groups, like the Native
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans, Polynesians, Easter Islanders. With no constabulary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals with a penchant for rape and pillage will inevitably act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up. A tribal warfare system will inevitably develop (or can you give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me historical counterexamples?)
</em><br>
<p>Actually, before the arrival of the Conquistadors, Native North American
<br>
societies (not including Aztecans and points south) were rather
<br>
peaceful, with inter-tribal warfare limited to ritualistic
<br>
confrontations for 'counting coup' similar to the jousting typical of
<br>
northern europe in medeival times. It was only with the arrival of
<br>
deadly communicable diseases and horses that indians in North America
<br>
took on a rape and pillage way of life.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, as a historical counterexample, take medieval Iceland. The
<br>
sagas recount a really idyllic society with no government, merely an
<br>
informal priestly cast of 'umpires', where free trade was the norm and
<br>
the only coersion was that individuals honor their contracts. Nor was
<br>
this society isolated from the rest of the world, for the Vatican had
<br>
repeatedly sent a Bishop and missonaries to the island, and trade in
<br>
live animals (arctic falcons, etc) originating in Iceland spread as far
<br>
as Mecca and Istanbul.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; land, you need land to buy land). This works like a ratchet. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; landless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people are willing to work for a pittance, as there is a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them (it's much easier to produce a few humans than a new plot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; land, so barring pestilence, war and famine, there is more people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than land), they have no choice (there is no industry on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pimple of a planet)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another unrealistic assumption.  I'd expect some industry to arise and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological progress -- unless there were strict controls against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### How many thousands of years did take to invent the wheel (counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the first emergence of ungoverned humans)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A government (usually a bad one) will form well before industry, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without stability offered by a good government, hardly any research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will take place.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, outside of agricultural trade in grain, olive oil,
<br>
wine, and many other goods, mining was the first heavy industry, traces
<br>
of which can be dated back as far as 5000 BC with simple metals like
<br>
gold, tin, silver and copper, while flint and obsidian mines have
<br>
operated for thousands of years into the Ice Age, trading their goods
<br>
over thousands of miles.
<br>
<p>See &quot;The Substance of Civilization&quot; for further info.
<br>
<p>Government arises, outside of purely tribal chieftan forms, when local
<br>
population pressure outstrips the ability of a hunter/gatherer or
<br>
subsistence farming lifestyle to support it and organized technologies,
<br>
like irrigation ditching, is required to boost food production, and the
<br>
division of labor becomes complex enough to require a significant
<br>
management overseeing a community.
<br>
<p>One could make an argument that both food supply and population pressure
<br>
have been chicken-egging each other (and the need for government) onward
<br>
for all of human history, where local scarcity conditions have required
<br>
some level of 'lifeboat rules' to ensure that as many people get
<br>
relatively fairly fed as possible.
<br>
<p>Government is only created when some portion of the population
<br>
encounters conditions of scarcity in the local area. Humans had been
<br>
innovating and industrializing long before this became necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and they can only work for the large landowners,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as the small farmers do not need hired hands or couldn't afford it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is no more than the basic economic scenario of Karl Marx being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; played out in an agrarian society on another planet.  Notably, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scenario that has ever played out in a real agrarian society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive coercion involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Coercion always comes first - government comes later. This played
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out in hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies hundreds of times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (again, Native Americans, Polynesians......)
</em><br>
<p>Coersion IS government. What part of the word &quot;en-force&quot; don't you
<br>
understand?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Every ten laborers you have working for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; means you can buy out another small farmer who is in trouble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The freely elected constabulary will not do anything because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no crimes are committed. An oligopoly controlling land forms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spontaneously, stifling competition, slowing progress, ruthlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destroying its opponents. The rich soon form a hermetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aristocracy, buy control of the government, and change the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; name of the colony to New Colombia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is unlikely for many reasons.  One, as more land gets bought up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the incentive for people to band together against further buying up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### What do you mean exactly? Communes putting together their monies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to buy land from the rich? Where on Earth did they form (aside from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those insignificant credit unions)?
</em><br>
<p>I think he is referring to land monopolies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Such cooperation happens &quot;spontaneously&quot; in many instances --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from small businesses helping each other out to various corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (why wouldn't landowners just hire the right people to manage their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them and run it like a corporation?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ###  Precisely what types of &quot;small businesses&quot; are going to help each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other out, trying to stop land consolidation and how?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Landowners do - they hire accountants, overseers, and hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap peons to do the work, if such laboreres are available due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scarcity of land.
</em><br>
<p>Land scarcities are created by a lack of development. When you develop
<br>
an acre of land, it's utility increases such that it becomes the
<br>
economic equivalent of many more acres.
<br>
<p>Unless their land is taken by force, landless individuals living in land
<br>
monopolies have only themselves to blame for selling out in the past.
<br>
<p>The fact is that all people strive to earn a living. When they are
<br>
restrained from doing so by a monopolist of any sort, they will
<br>
challenge the monopoly in one way or another. Government is one way of
<br>
doing so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and other contractual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreements to ward off mergers and the like.  (Sometimes, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient to do so, but beforehand, we can't always be sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntary behavior is inefficient or that coerced behavior can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Who is going to ward off mergers??? Why? How?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We agreed there is no coercion allowed in this experiment, so you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to be pretty smart, trying to stop landowners from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consolidating their holdings by marriage.
</em><br>
<p>The inaccurate assumption is that a merger of two firms will result in a
<br>
merger of two market shares.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two, land will go up in value if some want to buy more and more of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The price will rise, meaning that owners of it will make more money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no way to tell how much, but this already shows how your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario is a bit unrealistic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### You are forgetting that the large landowners make more money than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the small ones, both gross, and sometimes even per acre (they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afford the expensive, imported machines). The less land available for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sale there is, the more difficult it is for the small operators to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; join the game.
</em><br>
<p>Yet in your scenario, there are heaps of landless peasants available.
<br>
Machinery only does labor in place of man. If machinery is too
<br>
expensive, then human labor becomes competetive, and small operators are
<br>
also therefore competetive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Three, you assume that inheritance alone will preserve large estates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Historically, this has not been the case.  In fact, inherited wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often declines after a time.  Surely, there are exceptions, but even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biggest family fortunes tend to get consumed over time and less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entrepreneurial and frugal family members take over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Historically, that *was* the case, at least in countries with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primogeniture (or can you give me specific and numerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterexamples?). &quot;From rags to rags in three generations&quot; is mainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a phenomenon of the capitalist society, where you need to be on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toes to stay on top.
</em><br>
<p>This is inaccurate. Rags to riches to rags in three generations is a
<br>
phenomenon reported in such places as medieval Vietnam (up to the
<br>
present day, even), India, and many other cultures.
<br>
<p>Actually, the rags to rags phenomenon will occur faster, on average,
<br>
when primogeniture is NOT prevalent. Think about it: the more a fortune
<br>
is divided with each generation, the quicker a large fortune for one
<br>
person dissolves into merely a fortunate but small windfall for many,
<br>
which is quickly consumed in many cases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This process, the concentration of a crucial and non-expandable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Land actually is expandable in many ways.  One, land that was formerly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marginal can become profitable if it's physically altered, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleared, irrigated, and plowed.  Two, if the price of land increases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall, then more marginal pieces will be economically usable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Three,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land can be created in the sense of reclaiming land from the sea or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building islands.  Four, things like agriskyscrapers could create new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land on top of old land -- if they became economical.  We can't just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume static amounts and values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### This is orthogonal to the issue of land concentration - land is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanded only if there is population pressure, with total demand for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food exceeding the supply. It does not result in an unlimited supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of land at competitive prices - entrepreneurs cannot make money by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offering cheap &quot;land&quot; in skyscrapers to undercut the traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; landowners (as opposed to memory chip makers being able to flood the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market with every new advance in technology). Marginal land sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offers a refuge for subsistence farmers, but with enough pressure even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they might end up being displaced.
</em><br>
<p>But you just argued about there being a market balance. If there is a
<br>
balance, then displacement pressure will not occur. As technologies for
<br>
using land more efficiently becomes cheaper, subsistence farmers are
<br>
able to subsist on ever smaller (and therefore less expensive) plots of
<br>
land).
