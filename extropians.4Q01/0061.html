<p>I don't get this coward thing. I mean, sure, they might have figured out a

way to kill more people without having to die themselves, so one could

perhaps call them somewhat suboptimally clever, but cowardly? Giving a

superior adversary extra angles for attack, because you're trying to be

fair? How stupid is that??? No, I definitely don't get that coward thing.

<p><em>&gt; Indicting them for violating the Koran (which they did in spades; it

<p>Ignoring the issue of whether your target audience will believe you

(doubtful, you've been already flagged as Great Satan), the target
<br>
audience will never see you propaganda, because relevant media are
<br>
extremely prejudiced against western memes.
