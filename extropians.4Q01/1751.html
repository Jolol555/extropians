<p>Well, I already live in a small town (12,500 pop) in a rural area with
<br>
plenty of farmland (though not as much as Texas), and am partly well
<br>
set. I'm fine with all the camping/survival equipment, I've got a cabin
<br>
to go to (the family owns it and its on leased timberland) and I've
<br>
plenty of experience with various sorts of farming as well as
<br>
hunter/gathering to make a go of it if need be. I don't have renewable
<br>
energy equipment, though. I have been working on building up a library
<br>
on book and CD-ROM of technology.
<br>
<p>The proper location is all dependent upon what sort of hell you think
<br>
the world is heading to. Ice age? go to Texas. Hot age? Come up to NH,
<br>
or Alaska. Nukes? Try rural areas of the west coast. Pick your poison.
<br>
<p>My personal opinion is that if this sort of thing is set up, we should
<br>
designate several locations as Emergency Exclaves, preferably with one
<br>
or more extropes living in the local area designated to maintain caches
<br>
of things paid for by donations by those who want in. It might be good
<br>
to actually buy some plots of land in areas where land is cheap (or
<br>
lease it, which is even cheaper). In northern Maine, for example, you
<br>
can buy lots of land for under $100/acre that is wooded with plenty of
<br>
game and water and is clearable for farming. You can lease land from the
<br>
lumber companies for not much more than the cost of state property taxes
<br>
(each lease usually covers 5 acres and there are a limited number
<br>
offered per unorganized township). I'm sure similar situations exist
<br>
elsewhere in the country.
<br>
<p>I have some contacts with Champion and Meade Paper Companys' land
<br>
management offices.
<br>
<p>The advantage of having several is that it allows those who wind up with
<br>
limited transportation to reach the closest E-Exclave rather than
<br>
trucking across a continent that may be in ghu what knows condition.
