<p>
majority of an entire country's population.  Strategies that require a
<br>
majority of a population to participate have been known to succeed.  The
<br>
American Revolution succeeded.  Martin Luther King succeeded.  But
<br>
anything on that massive a scale takes billions of dollars, a core group
<br>
of activists willing to devote their entire lives to the problem, and even
<br>
then it still takes a generation to set up the initial conditions if they
<br>
haven't been set up already.
<br>
--------------------------------------------------
<br>
The small group of activists are the agents of change, the changes you
<br>
cite did not actually involve the majority of the population as drivers
<br>
of change but as secondary actors.  I think you mean to imply this, but
<br>
I am not certain.  The difference between the majority population as
<br>
drivers of change and as secondary agents is subtle but nontrivial 
<br>
difference.  In the end it looks like everyone who has adopted the 
<br>
resultant philosophy participated in the impetus event for the change, 
<br>
rather than in the secondary events which carried the change to fruition.  
<br>
It is generally a small group of activist visionaries who agitate change 
<br>
(for better or worse), and the population gets caught up in it once the
<br>
&quot;winds of change&quot; are already blowing.
<br>
<p><p><p>Maybe I'm being too harsh here.  I guess a lot of these ideas look a lot
<br>
less silly if you're planning for a 50-year or, ha ha, 100-year outlook. 
<br>
But try pretending, as a mental exercise, that everything you do with your
<br>
life has to be completely finished by 2008 to do any good, and see what
<br>
that does to your perspective.
<br>
----------------------------------------------
<br>
It makes it as short-sighted as the people who've caused so many of the
<br>
world's current problems, that's what it does.  That time it takes to
<br>
set up the initial conditions is necessarily part of the change process.
<br>
That takes a while.
<br>
<p>If it were that only projects which can be completed in approx 6.25 years
<br>
were of any value, we'd be screwed, because it'll take that long just to
<br>
convince the small group of driving agents to form some kind of working
<br>
platform with which to drive any meaningful change... 
<br>
<p>Indeed, if we look at Webmind (which Eli is familiar with, I'm not sure
<br>
how many others here are), what killed that project more than lack of
<br>
funding was lack of consensus amongst the driving parties (not that 
<br>
little practicalities like funding and the time it takes to actually
<br>
do the work to change or invent any substantial system - social or
<br>
technical - are irrelevant).
<br>
<p>Radical changes that happen in an instant are preceeded by a heck of a
<br>
lot of prior instants which lead up to the radical change.
<br>
<p>By the way, to Steve who started the thread... prior to access to full
<br>
information regarding transhuman philosophy, I think there is a fairly
<br>
large portion of the earth who could stant access to a full meal every
<br>
day - and perhaps some literacy classes before they could make any sense
<br>
of said information.
<br>
<p>Also, the problem with radical agendas is that they always over-promise
<br>
(especially on timelines) and under-deliver, then people get frustrated
<br>
and go looking for some intriguing new or comforting old agenda to 
<br>
follow... Transhumanism or posthumanism as radical dogma, rather than
<br>
a part of a set of guiding principles for careful and reasoned change,
<br>
seems to me to be in danger of the very same failings as more common
<br>
ideologies (blind adherence and failure to deliver on promises). 
<br>
<p>Maybe I'm just boring and uninspired, but I'm all for a sensible plan
<br>
with short, mid, and long-term components... I just don't see &quot;radically
<br>
altering the nature of the human body and spacetime itself through 
<br>
nanotechnology and AI&quot; as part of a five-year plan, unless (and this is
<br>
still a big maybe, not that it matters since it's not going to happen) 
<br>
every single global resource that wasn't going towards maintaining the 
<br>
basic human and technical infrastructure to support a society capable of 
<br>
such a project were put on the project itself. (Or someone gets really,
<br>
really &quot;lucky&quot;.)  
<br>
<p>LL+P,
<br>
