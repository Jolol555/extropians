<em>&gt; Actually, they deserve fundamental protections simply as human

</em><br>
<p>You are apparently rather ignorant of history. Under the Geneva
<br>
Conventions, a combatant caught in civilian clothes in a zone of combat
<br>
is subject to summary execution, which has been used more often than
<br>
not, it was not until Vietnam that one of these cases actually made it
<br>
into the news, because prior to that the news media was fully aware of
<br>
the Conventions and what they said.
<br>
<p>The only war criminals ever brought to trial for war crimes immediately
<br>
following a conflict were high ranking general officers and civilian
<br>
leaders. Many times more lower rankers are given summary judgement in
<br>
military courts. In europe after WWII, for instance, there were only a
<br>
hundred or so Nazis who were tried and convicted of war crimes in public
<br>
courts (these courts were still military tribunals under military
<br>
jurisdiction). Whermacht, Luftwaffe, and other military enlistees and
<br>
other low rankers were given summary judgement by military tribunals in
<br>
Germany by the allied military JAG corps, most of whome were sentenced
<br>
to prison time, if they lived that long. Typically, getting caught by
<br>
the enemy committing a war crime on the battlefield usually resulted in
<br>
the individual being executed on the spot. For example, serrating your
<br>
bayonet, or posessing hollow point ammo, would result, when captured, in
<br>
summary execution by any enemy officer (providing you were not court
<br>
martialed by your own side prior to combat, of course).
<br>
<p>Prosecution of war crimes by combatants does not belong in civilian
<br>
courts.
