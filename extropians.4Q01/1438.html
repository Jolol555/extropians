</em><br>
<p>Since your projectile is already hardened for 1400 g's, make the fuel an
<br>
explosive shaped charge (or several charges) to optimize density,
<br>
perhaps using that theoretical N60 nitrogen fullerene explosive (which
<br>
as I recall is 100-125% more effecient than PETN).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;=================\\
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;DDDDDDDDD||payload &gt;&gt;

<p>where D are shaped charges and the &quot;=&quot; is the casing.

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It would seem to me that for any payload capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; withstanding the rigors of such a launch method--bulk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; payloads of food, water, fuel, and building materials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immediately come to mind--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nuclear fuel would be good perhaps, since it is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dense.  Water might be a bit problematic since its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; density is low enough that the payload ballistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coefficient of the shell goes down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was once interested in a rail launch where a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human is sent up, submerged in water.  I got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into this after putting a number of minnows in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a centrifuge at 100 G for 10 minutes.  They all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survived.  {8^D
</em><br>
<p>I'm not surprised. USAF G tests once showed a person suitable harnessed
<br>
and equipped with G suit could withstand momentary 30+ G accelerations.
<br>
The only real difficulty in water immersion is dealing with possible
<br>
nitrogen narcosis (bends) produced by relief of acceleration. Using
<br>
helium/oxygen mixes as deep sea divers do is an obvious solution, along
<br>
with breathing hyperoxygenated fluids.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My design for a rail launched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human capsule didn't work out with a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rail length, unless you can go up the side of one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the worlds tallest mountains.  This can be problematic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for as soon as you propose it, some silly prole will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue that mountains are sacred, yakkity yak and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bla bla.
</em><br>
<p>Kilimanjaro. Pay the Kenyans enough bux and they'll fall all over
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the economic advantages of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gun launch present a striking commercial opportunity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...would seem a promising means to that end.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So I have to ask, &quot;Where's the problem?. Why hasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyone done this?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its hard.  Even after ya know how to do it.  {8-]
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that its so '19th Century' an idea that ignorant money
<br>
people automatically assume its an insane idea.
<br>
<p>BTW: did Bull's barrel segments get destroyed after the war or are they
<br>
still sitting in some British scrap heap?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also,  sometime back I read that the PV solar panels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the Internation Space Station generate 65 kw and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cost $500,000,000.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ja, those things are pricey.  They are specialty PV
</em><br>
<em>&gt; panels, able to withstand launch environment, orbit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment and still demonstrate 3 nines reliability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after 5 yrs in orbit.
</em><br>
<p>Primarily because you've gotta keep a similar setup running in a vacuum
<br>
chamber here on earth with more run hours than the one in space accrues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parabolic dish made of minimum thickness  styrofoam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and coated with a film of appropriate reflective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; material.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Styrofoam wont hold up in earth orbit for even a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days.  Atomic oxygen and UV will eat it up.  But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear what you are suggesting.  The convincing studies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to date have been on mylar balloons which are metallized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by vaporized aluminum on orbit.  Then the reflective surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holds up after the mylar surface is oxydized away.  Ill see if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can find URLs that refer to it.
</em><br>
<p>Take the mylar balloon to inflate to produce the surface, then use an
<br>
ion deposition system to thicken one side of it up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For comparison purposes, at 10% conversion efficiency,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and 1300 watts/sq meter, you can get 65 kw out of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dish a mere 13m in radius.  (And a dish of 100m radius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; delivers a healthy 4 mega watts.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with the biggie dish is the conversion at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focal point.  Since we are materials limited to max temperatures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; below about 4000K, there might not be any big advantages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to making one huge reflector.
</em><br>
<p>Well, normally you get about 250 deg F in space in normal sunlight in
<br>
earth orbit, which is 394 K, so you can focus ten times the normal
<br>
sunlight on your heat sink. The big advantage of focusing energy is that
<br>
PV cells work more efficiently the more sunlight you shine on them.
<br>
Krystall, Inc. of Issaquah, WA had this demonstrator I saw a few years
<br>
ago of a cylinder of GaAs/GaAnt multi-layer cells converting power off
<br>
of a natural gas burner stack. They were developing a hybrid electric
<br>
car and portable generators using said setup. They were getting several
<br>
kW of power from I'd guess about 24 sqare inches of solar cells.
<br>
<p>El cheapo system I can think of: several large (2 meter dia) umbrella
<br>
mechanisms that have a gold plated steel mesh fabric focusing on a few
<br>
square decimeters of high efficiency solar cells.
<br>
<p>I say screw all the heavy duty testing and 3 nines performance
<br>
requirements. Spend the money on shipping up twice as many as you need
<br>
instead and test em in orbit, keeping those with bad components as
<br>
scavenge items to repair those that fail in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Two immediate obsevations.  Weightlessness would seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to allow an EXTREMELY large dish,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, it does.  So how do we convert the energy once we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrate that much of it?
</em><br>
<p>PV is fine for 5-10 times concentration levels, there is also a liquid
<br>
metal thermal system that the USAF's Phillips Lab developed for an OTV
<br>
vehicle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the hard vacuum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of space seems to suggest that the reflective surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would not be subject to oxidative degradation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only if we get waaaay up there.  Unfortunately the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leo environment has atomic oxygen, highly reactive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and at high speed relative to your orbitter.  Its pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very low, of course, but there are still jillions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collisions per square cm per second, and materials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break down after a while.  If we can lift the stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a couple thousand km, this problem goes away,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then we merely need to contend with radiation.
</em><br>
<p>Gold does not react easily with this atomic oxygen, which is why it is
<br>
the envelope of choice for many satellites.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I envision the dish as spin stabilized to keep it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pointed at the sun,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure but you still need to adjust the axis of rotation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a degree a day to account for its orbit about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sun.  {Assuming you have it orbitting in the earth's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborhood.}  So spin stabilization doesnt solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything.  But a degree a day isn't that hard to do,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the propellant required is estimated thus:  it takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much angular momentum to change a rotating body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pi/2 as it had to start with, so you need to turn 2 pi per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year, so estimate the moment of inertia of the dish and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the necessary rotation rate, multiply to get the angular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; momentum and you need 4 times that much per year.
</em><br>
<p>Unneeded. There are these long metal magnetic posts that are used in
<br>
satellites to orient them to a magnetic field. Hooking one of these up
<br>
to a clockwork mechanism, a reaction wheel, and some PV sensors to
<br>
detect the direction of the sun and you could keep it oriented without
<br>
any fuel use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps that argues against getting *too* carried away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the size of the dish, since moment of inertia increases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the 4th power of the diameter of a disk in general.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More later on that, gotta go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Maybe I'm just talking out my asteroid, but hey, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; havin' fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me too.  Speaking of which, shall we start a Lorrey-esque
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subgroup to discuss this, or will the extropians indulge us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by allowing us to post orbit-gun and inflatable dish stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the main list?  spike
</em><br>
<p>Well, Spike, I'm still waiting on your help with the XLSim
<br>
spreadsheet... ;)
