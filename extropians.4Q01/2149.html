A while back, Robin Hanson reported studies implying that losing mass
<br>
wasn't all that useful for health. A new study reported by AP (sorry, no
<br>
link), sez:
<br>
======================================
<br>
[blah blah] The exercise-and-diet group had lower blood pressure readings
<br>
during high emotional stress than did the exercise-only or the control
<br>
group, the study found. Exercisers had some similar improvements but not
<br>
nearly as pronounced. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Diet and exercise are common prescriptions for treatment of hypertension.
<br>
But the study showed weight loss had a greater effect than exercise did,
<br>
said the study's senior author, James A. Blumenthal of Duke. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;``If you think you are lowering your blood pressure by exercise, it's not
<br>
going to be all that much,'' Blumenthal said. ``Combining exercise with
<br>
dietary changes is where you are going to see the change in daily life and
<br>
under stress.'' 
<br>
<p>[and]
<br>
<p>The findings, published in the October issue of the American College of
<br>
Sports Medicine journal, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise,
<br>
assume heightened importance because of a separate study published in the
<br>
Nov. 1 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The New England Journal article compared people with high-normal blood
<br>
pressure to those with optimal pressure. The report said that over 10
<br>
years, those with high-normal blood pressure had a 150 percent to 250
<br>
percent greater risk of heart disease or stroke. Dr. Ramachandran Vasan of
<br>
Boston University School of Medicine said his findings point out the need
<br>
for lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure.
