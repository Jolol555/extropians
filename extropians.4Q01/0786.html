<p>Calm down!  I used to get excited when people said &quot;On the one hand...&quot; --
<br>
which should be &quot;On one hand...&quot;:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *Semantics* is the discipline centrally concerned with *the meaning of

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think the way it is used generally is different than the technical
<br>
discipline.  You're right, of course, but most people use it the wrong way
<br>
and are able to get what they mean.  They mean it's quibbling over
<br>
definitions or terms with no substantial matters in dispute -- or hiding the
<br>
more substantial stuff.
<br>
<p>With the FDA the problem is that labeling something a disease or not a
<br>
disease for them has policy implications -- not labeling something a disease
<br>
is akin to saying it's a nonproblem -- while for most people, I think, it
<br>
would seem to be something different.  I bet this standard is only applied
<br>
to life extension claims.  After all, broken bones are not diseases (in most
<br>
cases), yet we do treat them.  We don't just say, &quot;Ah, you've broken your
<br>
leg!  That's part of the living process.  Just hobble around from here
<br>
on.&quot;:)  I bet the FDA would approve a drug that helped bones to heal faster
<br>
over one that slowed down an aging process.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we should ask the FDA...
<br>
<p>Quibbling into the sunset,
<br>
