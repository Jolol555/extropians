JORDAN POLLACK:
<br>
SOFTWARE, PROPERTY &amp; HUMAN CIVILIZATION
<br>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_pollack.html">http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_pollack.html</a>
<br>
It seems to me that what we're seeing in the software area, and this is the
<br>
scary part for human society, is the beginning of a kind of dispossession.
<br>
People are talking about this as dispossession that only comes from piracy,
<br>
like Napster and Gnutella where the rights of artists are being violated by
<br>
people sharing their work. But there's another kind of dispossession, which is
<br>
the inability to actually buy a product. The idea is here: you couldn't buy
<br>
this piece of software, you could only licence it on a day by day, month by
<br>
month, year by year basis; As this idea spreads from software to music, films,
<br>
books, human civilization based on property fundamentally changes.
<br>
------------
<br>
What I've been working with for the past decade or so has been this question
<br>
of self-organization. How can a system of chemicals heated by the sun
<br>
dissipate energy and become more and more complex over time? If we really
<br>
understood that, we'd be able to build it into software, we'd be able to build
<br>
it into electronics, and if we got the theory right, we would see a piece of
<br>
software that ran and wasted energy in the form of computer cycles and became
<br>
more and more complex over time, and perhaps would bust through the ten
<br>
million line code limit. In this field, which I've been calling
<br>
co-evolutionary learning, we have had limited successes in areas like games,
<br>
problem-solving, and robotics, but no open ended self-organizing reaction.
<br>
Yet.
<br>
---------------
<br>
What I'm trying to do is separate academe from industry by giving academics
<br>
back all their intellectual properties, and accept a tithe, like 9 percent of
<br>
the value of all IP created on campus, including books and software and
<br>
options in companies. I call it the &quot;commonwealth of intellectual property,&quot;
<br>
and through it a community of diverse scholars can share in some way in the
<br>
success, drive, and luck of themselves and their colleagues. Most people are
<br>
afraid of this, but I am certain it would lead to greater wealth and academic
<br>
freedom for smaller universities like my own.
<br>
<p>---   ---   ---   ---   ---
<br>
<p>Useless hypotheses, etc.:
<br>
&nbsp;consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
<br>
analog computing, cultural relativism, GAC, Cyc, Eliza, cryonics, individual
<br>
uniqueness, ego, human values, scientific relinquishment, malevolent AI,
<br>
non-sensory experience, SETI
<br>
<p>We  move into a better future in proportion as science displaces superstition.
