<em>&gt; Anti-Western and Extremist Views Pervade Saudi Schools

<em>&gt; By NEIL MacFARQUHAR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/19/international/middleeast/19SAUD.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/19/international/middleeast/19SAUD.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It makes for pretty grim reading.  It suggests that many of the Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; males educated over the last decade or two are prime candidates for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being reprogrammed as assault weapons.
</em><br>
<p>I find the piece curious because the last time I was in that
<br>
part of the world (admittedly over 15 years ago) most Saudi
<br>
males received a large portion of their education outside of
<br>
Saudi Arabia.  At that time there was a cultural problem because
<br>
many young Saudis were quite westernized in their attitudes and
<br>
had some difficulty fitting into the life back home.  Perhaps
<br>
things have changed a good deal since then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Hamoud al-Shuaibi, an elderly sheik who issued a fatwa, or religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ruling, condemning the American attacks on Afghanistan, answered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; question on the Net about when jihad, or holy war, is permissible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'Jihad is allowed against infidels like the Jews, Christians and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; atheists,' he answered in part.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is not a standard Islamic answer.  It is not even an
<br>
standard Wahhabi answer.  It is the answer historically that
<br>
some of the Saud princes came up with but still rather twisted. 
<br>
The originals were mainly into jihad against those Muslims who
<br>
did not in their view fully live the faith as they believed it
<br>
should be lived.  There is also, I suspect, a difference between
<br>
&quot;allowed&quot; and required.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, if you read this -- can you possibly interpret the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement in any way other than &quot;these people want you dead&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Quite easily.  As I am sure you can also with a moment or two
<br>
more of reflection.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It would appear one of the main problems with Islam is that almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone can issue a &quot;fatwa&quot;.  The middle class Islamic people follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fatwas from individuals saying Islam cannot be used to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violence and the unemployed male youth of Saudi Arabia follow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fatwas that drive them to migrate to Afghanistan where they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn to commit &quot;jihad&quot; on the infidels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Now you have spread something that is the position of some
<br>
Wahabis as being the position of Islam in general haven't you? 
<br>
As far as I know, a &quot;fatwa&quot; is something different than a
<br>
jihad.  
<br>
<p><p>----------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Encyclopaedia of the Orient
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatwa 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arabic: fatwâ 
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatwa is a legal statement in Islam, issued by a mufti or a
<br>
religious
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lawyer, on a specific issue.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatwas are asked for by judges or individuals, and are
<br>
needed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in cases where a issue of fiqh is undecided or uncertain.
<br>
Lawsuits
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be settled on the basis of a fatwa.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is vital that a fatwa is not based upon the muftis or
<br>
lawyers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own will and ideas, he must render it in accordance with
<br>
fixed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;precedent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, fatwas have limited importance in most Muslim
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;societies, and are normally used only in cases of marriage,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inheritance and divorce. The importance of a fatwa depends on
<br>
its acceptance among most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people, and if people don't care about it, it is in reality
<br>
powerless. &quot;
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>That some highly placed Muslim figures have issued fatwas
<br>
ordering execution doesn't make fatwa synonymous with such usage
<br>
and it certainly doesn't make it synonymous or even related to
<br>
jihad.

<br>
JIHAD 
<br>
<p><p>&quot; This word has been in frequent use in the Western press over
<br>
the past several years, explained directly or subtlely, to mean
<br>
holy
<br>
&nbsp;war. As a matter of fact the term &quot;holy war&quot; was coined in
<br>
Europe during the Crusades, meaning the war against Muslims. It
<br>
&nbsp;does not have a counterpart in Islamic glossary, and Jihad is
<br>
certainly not its translation. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The word Jihad means striving. In its primary sense it is an
<br>
inner thing, within self, to rid it from debased actions or
<br>
inclinations,
<br>
&nbsp;and exercise constancy and perseverance in achieving a higher
<br>
moral standard. Since Islam is not confined to the boundaries of
<br>
&nbsp;the individual but extends to the welfare of society and
<br>
humanity in general, an individual cannot keep improving
<br>
&nbsp;himself/herself in isolation from what happens in their
<br>
community or in the world at large, hence the Quranic injunction
<br>
to the
<br>
&nbsp;Islamic nation to take as a duty &quot;to enjoin good and forbid
<br>
evil.&quot; (3:104) It is a duty which is not exclusive to Muslims
<br>
but
<br>
&nbsp;applies to the human race who are, according to the Quran,
<br>
God's vicegerent on earth. Muslims, however, cannot shirk it
<br>
even if
<br>
&nbsp;others do. The means to fulfil it are varied, and in our modern
<br>
world encompass all legal, diplomatic, arbitrative, economic,
<br>
and
<br>
&nbsp;political instruments. But Islam does not exclude the use of
<br>
force to curb evil, if there is no other workable alternative. A
<br>
&nbsp;forerunner of the collective security principle and collective
<br>
intervention to stop aggression, at least in theory, as
<br>
manifested in
<br>
&nbsp;the United Nations Charter, is the Quranic reference &quot;..make
<br>
peace between them (the two fighting groups), but if one of the
<br>
&nbsp;two persists in aggression against the other, fight the
<br>
aggressors until they revert to God's commandment.&quot; (49:9) 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Military action is therefore a subgroup of the Jihad and not
<br>
its totality. That was what prophet Mohammad emphasized to his
<br>
&nbsp;companions when returning from a military campaign, he told
<br>
them: &quot;This day we have returned from the minor jihad (war) to
<br>
&nbsp;the major jihad (self-control and betterment).&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Jihad is not a declaration of war against other religions and
<br>
certainly not against Christians and Jews as some media and
<br>
&nbsp;political circles want it to be perceived. Islam does not fight
<br>
other religions. Christians and Jews are considered as fellow
<br>
&nbsp;inheritors of The Abrahamic traditions by Muslims, worshipping
<br>
the same God and following the tradition of Abraham. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The rigorous criteria for a &quot;just war&quot; in Islam have already
<br>
been alluded to, as well as the moral and ethical constraints
<br>
that
<br>
&nbsp;should be abided by. Modern warfare does not lend itself to
<br>
those moral standards; and therefore, war should be replaced by
<br>
&nbsp;some other alternative for conflict resolution. An enlightened
<br>
and resolute world public opinion can overcome and subdue war
<br>
&nbsp;oriented mentalities. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The key is a change of heart. Just as there is a constructive
<br>
role for forgiveness in interpersonal relations, so might this
<br>
be
<br>
&nbsp;possible in international relations provided justice, and not
<br>
force, is the final arbiter. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;We have to acknowledge again, for the sake of honesty, that
<br>
historically all traditions, Muslim, Christian, Jew as well as
<br>
others,
<br>
&nbsp;had their lapses in honestly following the valued ideals of
<br>
their religions or philosophies. We all made mistakes, and we
<br>
still do.
<br>
&nbsp;Muslims are no exception, and time and again religion was
<br>
exploited by ambitious tyrants or violated by ignorant mobs.
<br>
This is
<br>
&nbsp;no reflection on religion, but it shows how desperately
<br>
humanity is in need of better education, more enduring concern
<br>
for
<br>
&nbsp;human dignity, rights and freedom, and vigilant pursuit of
<br>
justice, even at the price of curbing political and economic
<br>
greed. &quot;
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>We cannot afford to put down an entire religion and all of its
<br>
adherents as out to destroy us.  It is a very dangerous thing to
<br>
do (unsurvivably so) and it is also horrifically unjust and
<br>
misguided.
