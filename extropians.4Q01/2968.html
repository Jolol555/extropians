<em>&gt; The rest of the world's governments don't have the power to resist

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Germany used to have very strong laws (with some exceptions, see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; below) for protection of privacy. Now legal wiretapping, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest of &quot;The war against terrorism&quot; is under serious discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, and will probably be passed into a new law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some trivia:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many years ago at the Munich Olympics and following, there were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of terrorist actions, and the German government initiated a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new law to &quot;register&quot; people, in the interest of &quot;tracking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists&quot;. This law applies to all people, not only to foreigners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like me. So if a German citizen wants to move one floor down in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apartment building, for example, they would be breaking the law if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they didn't register their new address within a short period of time.
</em><br>
<p>This is the law in most all countries. It is the law here in the US. In
<br>
most states, it is the law to report any change of address to the DMV
<br>
within 10-45 days after moving. It has been this way for decades. The
<br>
difference is that most all police will only treat it as an advisory
<br>
thing. I don't know of anyone they've actually prosecuted for not doing
<br>
so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did it help &quot;track terrorists&quot; then? Does it now? People here can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out the answer quick enough, and see the high price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a nebulous goal of &quot;tracking terrorists&quot; costs.
</em><br>
<p>It only works when the players are already bought in to a high trust
<br>
mindset, which demonstrates the failure of most forms of state control:
<br>
they are only really effective when everyone plays by the rules, and
<br>
they assume, wrongly, that those baddies they are designed to protect us
<br>
against will also play by the rules. Criminals are criminals
<br>
specifically because they don't play by the rules.
