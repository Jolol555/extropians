WHAT NOW?
<br>
<p>From: Jaron Lanier
<br>
Date: 9.24.01
<br>

<br>
<p>I want nothing more right now than to have distance from the awful 
<br>
events of Sept. 11th, but distance is not available to me. I live 
<br>
five blocks from the poor World Trade Center and saw the attack from 
<br>
an outdoor café at the corner. I saw many things that I am not ready 
<br>
to describe. I was evacuated and returned almost a week later to find 
<br>
my home damaged. It isn't yet clear if I'll have to move or not. And 
<br>
yet, of course I feel lucky, even a little guilty, at my relatively 
<br>
extreme good fortune.
<br>
<p>Seeing the dreadful rescue site is an unbearably sad daily ritual. It 
<br>
is beyond my mental capacity to register that I have seen with my own 
<br>
eyes over 6000 civilians suddenly killed in front of me.
<br>
<p>I struggle for something useful to say. I think I'll be wiser about 
<br>
this at some point in the future, because some distance must surely 
<br>
form with time.
<br>
<p>Here is a scattering of ideas that might be of some small use:
<br>
<p>I must first address some remarks to &quot;Leftist&quot; readers in Europe. 
<br>
Many of you have suggested to varying degrees that we Americans 
<br>
brought this attack on ourselves through our horrid foreign policy. 
<br>
The claims vary from the mild- that we can't expect to extend our 
<br>
will around the world without somebody striking back- to the insane, 
<br>
as exemplified by the words of Karlheinz Stockhausen , who said the 
<br>
attack was &quot;the greatest work of art ever.&quot; I'm a composer, and I 
<br>
fear these words will tarnish the tradition of Western music forever. 
<br>
That someone could even think to say this is an indictment of our 
<br>
esthetics. Could one of our most prominent artists really have lost 
<br>
touch with all concerns other than the quest for extremity and public 
<br>
notice?
<br>
<p>To address the more mild slights: I don't think our recent foreign 
<br>
policy has been as consistently bad as it's often portrayed. Somalia 
<br>
really was a humanitarian effort; our Balkans policy was late and 
<br>
confused, but not imperialistic, and was at least better than 
<br>
Europe's; the Clinton mid-East peace proposal was enlightened, 
<br>
respectful to all sides, and at least plausible; our man Mitchell is 
<br>
roving around the world talking sense to all parties
<br>
<p>There are a lot of kinds of power. There's an odd strategic parity 
<br>
between post-industrial democracies and the new worldwide society of 
<br>
suicide-cult terrorists. You really don't need to envy us now, ok?
<br>
<p>Here is a historical framework that I have found useful in thinking 
<br>
about the attack: The advantages of confederation have not been 
<br>
constant. Rather, they've been on a constant track of modification 
<br>
due to changing technologies. Technology has changed the degree to 
<br>
which cooperation between people improves their fortunes.
<br>
<p>If we go back far enough, say before the bronze age, there were 
<br>
limits to the advantages individuals could gain from forming large 
<br>
alliances, and indeed there were benefits to staying in small hunting 
<br>
or scavenging parties instead of large ones.
<br>
<p>But once a technology like the shield appeared, it created a 
<br>
rationale for large scale cooperation. A line of men cold walk with 
<br>
their shields overlapped to form a moving wall of metal which was 
<br>
quite impenetrable. Similar observations could be made about 
<br>
agricultural and many other technologies. This enabling of scaling 
<br>
produced in its extremes the Roman Empire, and eventually the modern 
<br>
states.
<br>
<p>By the time we come to the twentieth century, there was a new 
<br>
problem: States had become TOO powerful, once again because of 
<br>
changing technologies. Survival in a nuclear age depended on détente 
<br>
and treaties, structures that superceded states.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we are now entering a period when tiny groups of people, or 
<br>
even individuals, routinely become powerful enough to be threats to 
<br>
large numbers of people. If this is so, then the original advantages 
<br>
of the state no longer apply. The technologies that are enabling this 
<br>
transition are, disturbingly, ones that I have devoted much of my 
<br>
life to improving; distributed communications networks, simulators, 
<br>
and open education institutions and teaching tools.
<br>
<p>As I think about the forms of defense that could protect us from 
<br>
repeated intense threats from insane but powerful small groups of 
<br>
people, I see few strategies that are appealing. We could try to live 
<br>
in something like an immune system instead of a state with it's 
<br>
attendant army. It's plain, after all, that a traditional army is 
<br>
ill-matched to the present threat. The immune system metaphor is 
<br>
revolting to us, however, because we've all struggled so hard to 
<br>
cease to be racist or to otherwise divide the human family into the 
<br>
similar and the foreign.
<br>
<p>It's hard to be completely honest about whether an immune system 
<br>
approach is what's really needed, or whether it's just the easiest 
<br>
response for us to envision. Xenophobia seems to me to be a universal 
<br>
human tendency, and that observation stands whatever mix of nature 
<br>
and nurture might be responsible.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, maybe ever more severe social structures that 
<br>
resemble immune systems are inevitable, and as we learn to survive in 
<br>
the new situation we will expose a new grim corner of the confines of 
<br>
the human condition.
<br>
<p>In the past, I was pro-privacy and most definitely against the notion 
<br>
of a government spying on me. Now I think I was crazy to have that 
<br>
position. Yes, the government poses a threat, but I wasn't willing to 
<br>
believe before that there were other threats that are even worse.
<br>
<p>I can see a few rays of hope that dimly illuminate how a society 
<br>
might be pleasant and still protect itself from violent/suicidal 
<br>
cults. Instead of surveillance, a high degree of transparency might 
<br>
protect us from evil. An American supreme court justice famously 
<br>
proclaimed that &quot;Sunlight is the best disinfectant&quot;. While this trope 
<br>
originally concerned censorship, it could just as easily be applied 
<br>
to the balance between privacy and security. The Dutch came upon a 
<br>
version of this. Theirs is a dense society of intense 
<br>
interdependence, and in it one does not close one's curtains. Perhaps 
<br>
we should make all our emails and phone calls freely available to 
<br>
anyone who is interested. Almost no one will be. Once revealed, our 
<br>
fascination with the private lives of other people will be so minimal 
<br>
that our boredom could form the basis of a stable social order.
<br>
<p>Another possibility is that we might retain privacy but imagine more 
<br>
elaborate governmental structures than we have yet seen to reduce the 
<br>
chances that intelligence agencies will abuse their powers or become 
<br>
lost to their own ideological phantoms.
<br>
<p>There is also a McLuhanesque thought that has occurred to me. In the 
<br>
last few years, the Arab world has encountered its own mass media for 
<br>
the first time, in the form of satellite television stations. I've 
<br>
seen a little of the material, and it is inflammatory. It might be 
<br>
the case that societies require some years to get sufficiently used 
<br>
to mass media so as not to be driven insane by it. World War II might 
<br>
have had something to do with the West's early experience of the 
<br>
power of mass media and modern propaganda. Over time one grows 
<br>
somewhat immune to it. In this light, cynicism is seen to be not only 
<br>
a good thing, but a mental habit that is necessary if any society is 
<br>
to survive in an age of potent media.
<br>
<p>Finally, I must address a question to my colleagues on edge.org. In 
<br>
the final decades of the twentieth century we've seen an 
<br>
unprecedented rejection of the enlightenment. The assault on 
<br>
rationality has come in many forms, from pricey astrologers for 
<br>
coddled pet dogs, to the prominence after centuries of obscurity of 
<br>
the most militant and strident variants of just about every world 
<br>
religion. We have recently seen neo-Christian suicide cults (the 
<br>
Branch Dividian), Jewish extremists not heard from since Roman times 
<br>
(the &quot;Settlers&quot;), Hindu ultra-nationalists, and many others.
<br>
<p>Is our way of marketing science and technology part of the problem? I 
<br>
must emphasize that it's the marketing that I worry about, not the 
<br>
technological capabilities or scientific theories. I'm thinking of 
<br>
the way we market computers as living things and Darwinian 
<br>
interpretation as an oracle. Some of this must play very strangely to 
<br>
people who are poor and wonder what will happen to them as the elites 
<br>
in the West soar into uncharted heavens on the wings of Moore's Law 
<br>
and the genome, hoping to leave even the most basic rules of life as 
<br>
it was known behind.
<br>
<p>Is violent fundamentalism in part encouraged by a sense that science 
<br>
and technology are ruining faith in the soul?
<br>
<p>I'm not talking about any notion of an immortal soul. I just mean the 
<br>
sense that a person is somehow really there, conscious, that when one 
<br>
communicates with other people they are similarly really there. I 
<br>
know many of the respondents on edge.org believe it's only a mental 
<br>
confusion to feel alive, but I beg you in this instance to reconsider 
<br>
your position. You can do so without harming science in any way, and 
<br>
you'd be more honest for having done it.
