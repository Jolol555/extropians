<br>
<p>LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
<br>
Night shift work associated with increased breast cancer risk
<br>
<p>The suppression of melatonin caused by exposure to light linked with higher
<br>
cancer rates may come as no suprise to life extensionists who have been
<br>
aware of melatonin's cancer preventive and other benefits for years.  Two
<br>
studies published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute this week
<br>
confirm that night shift work and exposure to nightime light are both
<br>
associated with a higher incidence of breast cancer.
<br>
<p>In one study, named as the first prospective cohort study of shiftwork and
<br>
breast cancer, data from 78,562 women in the nationwide Nurses' Health Study
<br>
was obtained from questionnaires that were completed by participants every
<br>
two years.  The women were asked questions concerning their health
<br>
status,risk factors for cancer, medical history, and whether they had worked
<br>
rotating night shifts at least three nights per month in addition to days or
<br>
evenings.  During the ten year follow up, 2441 women were diagnosed with
<br>
breast cancer.  Analysis of the data showed that women who worked from one
<br>
to twenty-nine years on rotating night shifts experienced a moderate
<br>
increase in breast cancer incidence, and those who worked night shifts for
<br>
thirty years or more had a greater risk of 36%, compared to the rest of the
<br>
group.
<br>
<p>In the other JNCI study, 813 women aged 20 to 74 diagnosed with breast
<br>
cancer between 1992 and 1995 were matched with 793 control subjects, and
<br>
both groups were interviewed on their sleep habits, bedroom lighting and
<br>
work shifts.  The risk of breast cancer was found to be elevated among those
<br>
who did not often sleep from 1:00 am to 2:00 am, the period of night when
<br>
melatonin levels are usually highest.  Subjects who had the brightest lit
<br>
bedrooms also had an increased risk as well as night shift workers, whose
<br>
risk rose with the amount of hours per week and years working nights to 60%
<br>
greater than that of controls.  Interrupted sleep was not associated with an
<br>
increased breast cancer risk.  The author of the study explains these
<br>
findings by noting that exposure to light at night suppresses normal
<br>
nocturnal production of melatonin by the pineal gland which could increase
<br>
ovarian estrogen production.  Elevated estrogen levels are a known risk
<br>
factor for breast cancer.  The journal's deputy news editor, Katherine
<br>
Arnold, noted the possibility that another mechanism of action of melatonin
<br>
against breast cancer may involve the p53 gene, a tumor suppressor.
<br>
<p>In an accompanying editorial, Jonni Hansen, PhD, of the Danish Cancer
<br>
Society in Copenhagen urged further exploration of the relationship between
<br>
nighttime light, night shiftwork and cancers that may be melatonin
<br>
influenced.
<br>
<p><p>PROTOCOL
<br>
Breast Cancer by Andrew Baer MD
<br>
<p>Although the cause of breast cancer has not been found, it has become clear
<br>
that hormonal manipulation may have a therapeutic impact on the course of
<br>
the disease. This is why the tumors, when removed during surgery, are
<br>
studied to find whether or not they are estrogen-receptor positive or
<br>
negative. If the cancer is estrogen-receptor positive, theoretically there
<br>
should be a response to manipulation of estrogen. This is exactly the role
<br>
tamoxifen has played as an adjuvant drug therapy in the treatment of the
<br>
disease. However, studies have demonstrated that after 2 years, tamoxifen
<br>
can cause an increase of estrogen in the blood. This is one reason that
<br>
breast cancer cells may become resistant to tamoxifen treatment. Another
<br>
reason tamoxifen fails to control cell proliferation is that
<br>
estrogen-receptor-positive cells often mutate into a cancer cell type that
<br>
does not need estrogen to proliferate. Tamoxifen can cause serious side
<br>
effects after two years, and for this reason it has been suggested that
<br>
tamoxifen treatment not go beyond a two-year time period. Those using
<br>
tamoxifen should also follow the Thrombosis Prevention protocol because
<br>
tamoxifen and cancer itself can increase the risk of abnormal blood clots.
<br>
<p>Melatonin and vitamin D3 have been shown to synergistically enhance the
<br>
beneficial effects of tamoxifen, and for this reason, women taking tamoxifen
<br>
should also take 4000 to 6000 IU of vitamin D3 and 3 to 50 mg of melatonin
<br>
nightly. While tamoxifen's side effects may limit its use to two years, most
<br>
people can take melatonin and moderate doses of vitamin D3 indefinitely. A
<br>
few people experience kidney toxicity and abnormal calcium metabolism when
<br>
taking high doses of vitamin D3, and breast cancer patients are also at a
<br>
high risk for developing blood calcium disorders. For all these reasons,
<br>
breast cancer patients who use therapeutic doses of vitamin D3 (4000 to 6000
<br>
IU a day) should have a regular blood chemistry panel that will reveal
<br>
kidney toxicity and calcium imbalances while these problems are still
<br>
reversible.
<br>
<p>Breast cancer cells frequently metastasize to the bone, where they cause
<br>
severe degradation of bone tissue.  The bisphosphonates are a class of drugs
<br>
that protect against the degradation of bone, primarily by inhibiting excess
<br>
activity of osteoclasts. The osteoclasts are bone cells that absorb and
<br>
remove bone tissue so that the osteoblasts can bring together the minerals
<br>
calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus to form new healthy bone. When
<br>
osteoclasts become overactive, they break down too much bone, which can
<br>
result in a pathological reduction of bone density.
<br>
<p>Among the known inhibitors of osteoclast activity, the bisphosphonates are
<br>
the most promising drugs. Clodronate, one of the most investigated
<br>
bisphosphonates, has been clinically utilized for over 15 years in treating
<br>
malignant diseases. It is the most-used, most effective, and safest drug in
<br>
the treatment of hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood). It inhibits
<br>
bone destruction, prevents bone fractures, relieves bone pain, and prevents
<br>
the development of new bone lesions. Clodronate may even reduce mortality.
<br>
<p>Bisphosphonates such as clodronate are potent osteoclast inhibitors that
<br>
have opened the way for a nontoxic medical treatment of bone metastasis.
<br>
Large-scale studies in humans with breast cancer indicate the benefits of
<br>
prolonged administration of clodronate to reduce the frequency of
<br>
pathological skeletal events and also the need for radiation therapy.

LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE, October 2001 issue
<br>
As we see it: Dying from deficiency, by Bill Faloon
<br>
<p>New scientific studies indicate that too many people are dying from simple
<br>
nutrient deficiencies.
<br>
<p>Dr. Bruce Ames recently published a paper stating that a deficiency of folic
<br>
acid, vitamins C, E, B6 , B12, niacin or zinc causes DNA strand breaks,
<br>
oxidative lesions and increased susceptibility to cancer. Dr. Ames compared
<br>
a deficiency of any one of these micro-nutrients to the DNA damaging effects
<br>
of radiation. When DNA strands are damaged, the body becomes more vulnerable
<br>
to cancer.
<br>
<p>Dr. Ames stated that a micronutrient deficiency may explain why people who
<br>
eat the fewest fruits and vegetables have about double the rate for most
<br>
types of cancer when compared to those with the highest intake. Fruits and
<br>
vegetables are a rich source of the micronutrients that protect DNA against
<br>
changes that can lead to cancer. Dr. Ames' conclusion was:
<br>
<p>&quot;Common micronutrient deficiencies are likely to damage DNA by the same
<br>
mechanism as radiation and many chemicals . . . Remedying micronutrient
<br>
deficiencies should lead to a major improvement in health and an increase in
<br>
longevity at low cost.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dr. Bruce Ames is a well respected expert on cancer. He is a Professor of
<br>
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of California-Berkeley
<br>
and developed the internationally recognized &quot;Ames Test&quot; that is used for
<br>
determining if a chemical damages cellular DNA.

<p><p>CHAT LIVE WITH DR ANDREW BAER WEDNESDAY
<br>
<p>Dr Andrew Baer's live chat sessions continue this Wednesday with the topic,
<br>
&quot;Can we prevent or cure cancer?&quot;  From Dr Baer:  &quot;The very word instills
<br>
fear in most people. We've spent countless dollars trying to find a cure yet
<br>
our treatments remain primitive. Oncologists still use chemotherapy
<br>
consisting of poisons in an attempt to kill cancer cells while sparing the
<br>
healthy ones. This is like trying to kill an ant with a sledgehammer. &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Are there ways that we can prevent cancer? What alternative therapies exist
<br>
and are they effective? Come to Wednesday's chat and find out.&quot;
