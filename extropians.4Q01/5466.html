</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>So, your motivations are purely rational? Which rationale stands behind 
<br>
&quot;don't want to&quot;, then? What would happen in that case and how can you be 
<br>
sure? Why do you care what those others say? If your argumentation is 
<br>
purely rational, under which circumstances would your logic lead you to 
<br>
give your weapons back?
<br>
<p>Is there any long-term planning without feelings? How did you decide which 
<br>
job to go for, which house to buy, which partner to marry? Pure rational 
<br>
logic?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  - People believe in religions because they feel alone without and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;empowered&quot; with it, even if history provides no proven evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their beliefs - &quot;just in case...&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the extent I believe in such things it has nothing at all to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do with any sort of &quot;just in case&quot; thinking or with feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone.  It does provide some sense of extra empowerment but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not in the least a primary motivation.
</em><br>
<p>Where does this &quot;empowerment&quot; come from? Can you give us a rational basis 
<br>
for it? How does it improve your logic?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  - People believe in cryonics and such because they fear to die, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if there's no evidence that they can reawake with their mind undamaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - &quot;just in case...&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, the fear of death and seeking to avoid it is certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully rational unless one believes in an afterlife and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even then.  While it hasn't been done yet a slim hope of future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revival is seen as better than no hope.
</em><br>
<p>Hope is a feeling. Fear is a feeling. What would happen if you'd leave this 
<br>
idea? How would you feel? Why not improve your current life instead of 
<br>
wasting energy and time for a belief?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  - People believe in transhumanism to find comfort in the fiction of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better tomorrow, even if there is no rational basis for their theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - &quot;just in case...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is one is utterly absurd.  People are transhumanists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they believe it is possible to transcend the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human condition in various ways and are actively willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engage in the attempt to do so.
</em><br>
<p>Believing is a form of feeling, not of knowing and rational thinking. Hope 
<br>
for a better future is a feeling. 
<br>
<p>Hey, feelings aren't bad. They are sometimes irrational at first sight, 
<br>
yes. We cannot trust them 100%, okay. We have to analyze and control them, 
<br>
right. But a well trained feeling can often guide and motivate us better 
<br>
than tedious logic. So, don't be afraid of feelings :-)
