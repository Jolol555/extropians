<p>
Amara provided a counterpoint to the Lionel Tiger, &quot;Rogue Males&quot;
<br>
article (which I believe I may have originally posted).
<br>
<p>It is worth pointing out that for her counterpoint she drew
<br>
on her neighbor (in Germany), an Egyptian muslim.
<br>
<p>To be balanced about this we would need to know perhaps
<br>
what the educational level of her neighbor is and why and
<br>
how he left Egypt.  Presumably we have some kind of selection
<br>
effect (not dissimilar to that which almost all Americans
<br>
have previously been subjected to) that foreign immigrants
<br>
were dissatisfied with the situation in their home land and
<br>
were smart enough to seek better opportunities elsewhere.
<br>
So the opinions on which Amara is challenging the Tiger
<br>
position should be looked at in context.  It is of course
<br>
natural for immigrants to seek to downplay the conditions
<br>
of their homeland when speaking with &quot;foreigners&quot; (particularly
<br>
when challenged by a potentially inflamatory piece of &quot;journalism&quot;).
<br>
<p>We may also want to bear in mind that Egypt is one of the
<br>
more moderate Arabic states.  It is a democracy where women
<br>
do have the right to vote unlike many Arabic states.
<br>
(It would be nice to know precisely which states are not
<br>
democracies and which do not allow women to vote as I think
<br>
this would better reflect the environment on which the Tiger
<br>
article was focused).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Polygamy is not common there. Not in Egypt. It's slighly more common 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Gulf states than in Egypt, but it's still very unusual. Of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men, you find mostly the richest (in Saudi Arabia, for example) or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most powerful politicians living a polygamous lifestyle (even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though their religion permits it). 
</em><br>
<p>I believe I commented at one point that the issue is poverty.
<br>
Women are unlikely to freely marry someone without good opportunities
<br>
for supporting children.  Egypt's GDP/capita ($3600) is significantly
<br>
lower than Saudi Arabia ($10,500), or the UAE ($22,800) and so
<br>
it makes sense that fewer men in Egypt would be polygamous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;$40,000 (£27,000) - an impossible accumulation for all but a few&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a peanut amount of money for the many in the United Emirates. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, given a U.S. GDP/capita of 36,200, we can scale $40,000 to
<br>
~$63,000 by U.S. standards which is *quite* a nest egg.  Certainly
<br>
not one that most U.S. males between 20-30 have sitting in a bank
<br>
account.
<br>
<p>More importantly (and very surprisingly(!)) compared to the U.S.
<br>
age 15-64 male/female ratio of 0.98, in Saudi Arabia the ratio
<br>
is 1.41 M/F while in the U.A.E. the ratio is 1.73 M/F.
<br>
<p>So even without polygamy one has a significant shortage of women!
<br>
(It isn't surprising they are looking for Russian wives where the
<br>
ratio is 0.94 M/F).
<br>
<p>[Source: CIA World Fact Book]
<br>
<p>My conclusion would be that if only the wealthiest 1% of the male population
<br>
of Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. are polygamous, that will leave the poorest
<br>
3-5% mateless.  That works out to at least a half a million men who
<br>
(in two of the less populous Arab countries) are unlikely to be
<br>
able to fulfill the biological prime directive.
<br>
<p>The Saudi American bank estimate for unemployment is 15% with unofficial
<br>
estimates being higher (<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/saudi.html">http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/saudi.html</a>).
<br>
I suspect this primarily consists of young males giving you numbers
<br>
of ~1.5-2.4 million individuals who are likely to have a difficult
<br>
time securing mates.
<br>
<p>So leaving aside any rhetoric of the Tiger article, I do not find
<br>
unbelievable the premise that there is a pool of unemployed, mateless
<br>
males in Arabic countries who provide fertile soil for memes that the
<br>
U.S. is polluting their culture (witness Satellite TV) and must
<br>
be destroyed.
