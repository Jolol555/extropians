</em><br>
<p>80-100 years ago, the Saudi family was conducting it's campaign of
<br>
consolidation of the Arabian Penninsula, while being supported by an
<br>
upstart sect known as Wahhabis, who took over control of Mecca and
<br>
Medina when the Sauds ejected the Husseini caliphate from those cities.
<br>
Since that time, the vast majority of the clerical posts of the worlds
<br>
mosques have been taken over by Wahhabis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would also point out that the Arab world was much more

</em><br>
<p>Yes, they were once quite advanced. So was China, and Pakistan, and
<br>
Iraq, if only you go back far enough. This does not mean that the
<br>
current governments in those areas have any basis for being considered
<br>
civilized, enlightened, or having any respect for human rights. Nations
<br>
that insist on being treated with respect because of their long dead
<br>
history while shuffling their present misdeeds under the rug contribute
<br>
nothing to truth, progress, or an extropian future, and doing the moral
<br>
relativity game with respect to them on such a basis fails in
<br>
contributing as well.
