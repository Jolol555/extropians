My favorite, partly because the author's unknown:
<br>
<p>A certain Phys Rev referee
<br>
Considers all papers with glee:
<br>
&quot;What's new is not true,
<br>
And what's true is not new,
<br>
Unless it was written by me.&quot;

<br>
<p>A Brief History of Gravity
<br>
by Bruce Elliott
<br>
<p>It filled Galileo with mirth
<br>
To watch his two rocks fall to Earth. 
<br>
He gladly proclaimed,
<br>
&quot;Their rates are the same,
<br>
And quite independent of girth!&quot;
<br>
<p>Then Newton announced in due course 
<br>
His own law of gravity's force:
<br>
&quot;It goes, I declare,
<br>
As the inverted square
<br>
Of the distance from object to source.&quot;
<br>
<p>But remarkably, Einstein's equation
<br>
Succeeds to describe gravitation
<br>
As spacetime that's curved,
<br>
And it's this that will serve
<br>
As the planets' unique motivation.
<br>
<p>Yet the end of the story's not written; 
<br>
By a new way of thinking we're smitten. 
<br>
We twist and we turn,
<br>
Attempting to learn 
<br>
The Superstring Theory of Witten!
<br>

<p>Condensed Story of Ms Farad
<br>
by A. P. French
<br>
<p>Miss Farad was pretty and sensual
<br>
And charged to a reckless potential;
<br>
But a rascal named Ohm
<br>
Conducted her home -
<br>
Her decline was, alas, exponential.
<br>

<br>
<p>Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen
<br>
by David Halliday
<br>
<p>Two photons, close-coupled at start,
<br>
Flew several parsecs apart.
<br>
Said one, in distress,
<br>
&quot;What you're forced to express
<br>
Removes any choice on my part.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>The Cat in the Tree
<br>
by Peter Price
<br>
<p>Another great Dane has made free
<br>
With a question of Be or Not be.
<br>
Now might Schr&quot;dinger's puss,
<br>
In descending by Schuss,
<br>
Leave one track on each side of a tree?
<br>
<p>-----------------
<br>
<p>The Past Isn't What it Used To Be
<br>
by Bruce Elliott
<br>
<p>A professor of Physics named May
<br>
Complains of the classroom today,
<br>
&quot;The problem, you know,
<br>
Is that they're too slow.
<br>
We were far better students than they.&quot;
<br>
<p>His friend, a professor named Beecham,
<br>
Said &quot;It's true, you don't seem to reach 'em.
<br>
But they're not to blame,
<br>
For they haven't the same
<br>
Class of teachers that we had, to teach 'em!&quot;
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>A Physicist from Nantucket
<br>
by Michael Van Leeuwen
<br>
<p>There once was a man from Nantucket
<br>
Who...
<br>
...oops...just got a life.
